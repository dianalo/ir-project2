History of Old RuleThis final rule amends lease and grievance procedures for the public housingprogram under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (24 CFR Part 966).The lease and grievance procedures state HUD requirements for the leasebetween a Public Housing Agency (``PHA'') and its tenants, and for administrativehearings by the PHA of grievances raised by public housing tenants. Inthis Preamble, the term ``old rule'' refers to the lease and grievanceregulation in effect before this final rule.In February 1971, HUD issued circulars with instructions on lease requirementsand hearing procedures to all PHAs operating public housing (CircularsRHM 7465.8, ``Requirements and Recommendations to be Reflected in TenantDwelling Leases to Low-Rent Public Housing Projects'', and RHM 7465.9,``Grievance Procedure in Low-Rent Public Housing Projects'').In June 1973, the Department announced ``review and evaluation'' of thecirculars (38 FR 15988). On November 6, 1974, the Department publishedtwo proposed rules, one setting forth dwelling lease procedures and requirements,and the other stating grievance procedures and requirements (39 FR 39285,39287). Following public comment, final rules were published on August7, 1975, adopting Subparts A and B of 24 CFR Part 866 (40 FR 33402, 33406).B. History of This RulemakingIn this rulemaking, HUD published two proposed rules to amend the old leaseand grievance procedures. The proposed rules were published in December1982 and July 1986.On December 13, 1982 (47 FR 55689), HUD published a first proposed ruleto (1) simplify tenant lease requirements, including deletion of existingregulatory requirements for minimum notice of lease termination, (2) limitthe requirement for Public Housing Agency (PHA) grievance hearings fortenants to PHA determinations of tenant income or rent, (3) require thatevictions be carried out through judicial process and that terminationof tenancy must be based on violation of the lease, Federal, State or locallaw or other good cause.After publication of the first proposed rule, the Congress enacted section204 of the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 (HURRA) (referredto in this Preamble as the ``1983 law''). The 1983 law states new requirementsfor public housing leases and administrative grievance procedures (Pub.L. 98-181, November 30, 1983, amending section 6 of the U.S. Housing Actof 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k) and 1437d(1)). The 1983 law is consonant withsome aspects of the December 1982 proposed rule, but in other respectsseverely limits the scope of the regulatory reforms originally proposedby HUD. Section 204 of the 1983 law requires the PHA to establish and implementa tenant grievance procedure for ``any proposed adverse public housingagency action'', not just a determination of tenant income or rent, andprescribes minimum notice periods for termination of the lease. The legislationallows a PHA to exclude grievances concerning eviction or termination oftenancy from the administrative hearing procedure if HUD determines thatlocal law requires a hearing in court which provides the basic elementsof due process before a tenant is evicted.The Department received extensive public comments on the December 1982proposed rule, which was published before enactment of the 1983 law. 862comments were docketed by the HUD Rules Docket Clerk. Comments from legalaid offices and public housing tenants strongly opposed the proposed amendments.Comments from PHAs and the National Association of Housing and RedevelopmentOfficials were in general strongly in favor of the proposed amendments,although some technical changes were suggested.Because of the 1983 law, a second proposed rule was published by HUD inJuly 1986 (51 FR 26504). This rule proposed changes to implement the 1983law, and also other revisions after consideration of public comment onthe original proposed rule. (In this Preamble, ``proposed rule'' meansthe July 1986 proposed rule, unless otherwise indicated.)The Department docketed 87 comments on the July 1986 proposed rule. Ingeneral, the direction of public comment is very similar to comment onthe initial proposed rule of December 1982. PHAs and PHA organizationssupport promulgation of the amendments. Comments by the legal aid community,and other comments largely written or inspired by legal aid, vigorouslyoppose amendment of the old rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. General Character of Rule</ITAG>The contents of this rule are a historical change in Federal requirementsfor governance of public housing. The amendments touch every aspect ofpublic housing management, and potentially affect the texture of dailylife for the 3.4 million public housing residents.The new rule removes the burden of Federal regulations which unnecessarilydiminish the ability of the 3300 Public Housing Agencies to operate publichousing in response to local needs and conditions. At the same time, theregulations faithfully carry out statutory mandates under Federal law.Later sections of this Preamble describe in detail the reasons for particularchanges in the old lease and grievance rule, and the reasons for specificprovisions of the new rule. In this section, the Preamble discusses thebroad context and impetus of the new rule, and general reasons which supportmany of the specific changes. The justifications for the regulatory changesin this rule are comprised both of the specific reasons described in thediscussion of each particular provision, and the general considerationsdescribed in this section.This rule is the culmination of a major enterprise for the deregulationof public housing, in the context of the national movement for dereguationof unneeded and inefficient Federal controls. On August 12, 1981, the PresidentialTask Force on Regulatory Relief, chaired by Vice President Bush, designatedthe HUD Lease and Grievance Procedures for review. In its announcement,the Task Force commented:<ITAG tagnum="21">These rules establish compliance procedures that must be incorporatedin leases by local public housing authorities (PHAs) assisted by HUD. Notonly do they often duplicate and sometimes exceed State and local ordinances,they tend to make it difficult for PHAs to protect the health and safetyof tenants. For example, PHAs claim that disruptive tenants that violatetheir leases, vandalize housing and prey upon other tenants can avoid formonths effective remedial actions by the PHA. Reforming these requirementscould benefit tenants, PHAs and deserving families seeking public housing.</ITAG>In the context of deregulation, the reexamination of existing Federal regulationasks whether existing Federal regulation is required by law, or, if notrequired by law, whether there is a sufficient positive reason to retainthe preexisting regulation. In the case of the old lease and grievancerule, HUD regulatory requirements reach far beyond any obligation of law,including the 1983 law. In HUD's view, there is no adequate justificationfor retaining much of the detailed regulatory apparatus under the old rule.Conversely, there is excellent reason to believe that features of the oldrule have severely interfered with the efficient and effective managementof public housing.This final rule is based on a fresh and comprehensive examination of theregulatory scheme imposed by the old lease and grievance rule. All regulationimposes a cost on the entities which are regulated. The final rule removesregulatory limitations for which there is not now a persuasive positivejustification for imposing these costs.Public comments from the legal aid community protest changes of the variouspolicies embedded in the old rule, and claim that the changes are not substantiatedby ``new facts''. In response, it is important to stress that the relevantfactors before HUD in this rulemaking need not turn on the availabilityof empirical data or ``new facts'' concerning administration of publichousing under the old lease and grievance rule. Rather, the factors properlyconsidered by the Department more characteristically depend on examinationof the functions of specific regulatory provisions, and of the allocationof local discretion to the PHAs charged with statutory responsibility foradministration of the public housing program.In this examination, the determination of what regulatory controls shouldbe retained or newly imposed, and in what form, legitimately depends inconsiderable part on judgments of value, and is not readily reducible toa simple determination of fact, that could be resolved by a study or otherdata on functioning of PHAs under the old rule. In this rulemaking, HUD'sexamination is influenced by these broad values:<ITAG tagnum="15">_That less regulation is better regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_That local control is better than Federal control.</ITAG>Both values support the view that HUD should not regulate unless thereis a legal requirement or persuasive reason for Federal regulation.The statutory structure of the public housing program is designed to allowlocal flexibility in the administration of the housing. Public housingprojects are owned and run by Public Housing Agencies (``PHA''), whichare governmental entities chartered under State law (see, U.S. HousingAct of 1937, section 3(b)(6), 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(6)). By Federal statutorypolicy, Public Housing Agencies are to be vested with ``the maximum amountof responsibility in the administration of their housing programs'' (U.S.Housing Act of 1937, section 2, 42 U.S.C. 1437). This dynamic policy isnot applied and exhausted once and for all at the initial promulgationof a regulatory requirement. HUD has a continuing authority to reexamineexisting regulatory requirements, to determine if the existing requirementscan be withdrawn or modified, and to allow a broader play to PHA responsibilityin administration of its public housing program.Many PHAs have complained to HUD_in the course of this rulemaking and inother forums_that the requirements of the old rule have hindered or evencrippled PHA administration of the public housing program. In this rulemaking,HUD has given a particular weight to this judgment by the entity with statutoryresponsibility for administration of the program.For purpose of this rulemaking, there is no need for data on the statisticaldistribution of PHA difficulties in implementation of the old rule, orother detailed factual data on how the old rule has affected operationsat different PHAs. At the level of the individual PHA, experience underthe old rule may differ. PHAs may cope with the old rule or the new invery various ways.When HUD eliminates regulatory obligations under the old rule, PHAs willhave a greater freedom to structure local programs in accordance with localdesires, without the incubus of a uniform Federal requirement. If a PHAis troubled by aspects of lease and grievance practice which were mandatedunder the old rule, and which are removed in the new rule, the PHA willpresumably structure a different practice, utilizing the new freedom underthe new rule. Another PHA may elect to retain aspects of practice no longerprescribed by Federal rule.Freeing the PHA from a given Federal requirement has two advantages. First,the local consequences of a particular policy can be seen much more clearlyfrom the PHA than from Washington. The PHA can therefore adopt a policywith a better understanding of how the policy will work in the community,and can refine or revise the policy in the light of actual local experience.Second, the PHA can choose a policy that reflects local priority. PHA managementpolicy is a trade-off of different objectives. The removal of Federal regulatoryrequirements means that the PHA can make the trade-offs in the light oflocal values. In narrowing the scope of the pre-existing regulatory requirements,HUD defers to local values and to local knowledge of local facts. For thispurpose, HUD does not need ``new facts'' on national operation of the oldlease and grievance requirements.Public comment claims that HUD lacks an adequate ``factual basis'' forwithdrawing requirements under the old rule, citing the decision by theSupreme Court in <T3>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Asso. </T3>v. <T3>State Farm</T3>, 463 U.S. 29, 103 S. Ct. 2856 (1983). However, so faras opposite to the present rulemaking, <T3>Motor Vehicle </T3>stands merely for the proposition that the revocationof a prior agency regulation is governed by the same standard of judicialreview as is the initial promulgation of the regulation_whether the agencyaction was ``arbitrary and capricious''. A reviewing court may not setaside an agency rule that is rational, based on consideration of the relevantfactors, and within the scope of the authority delegated to the agencyby the statute.In <T3> Motor Vehicles, </T3>the statute directed the agency (Department ofTransportation) to issue standards for the purpose of promoting motor vehiclesafety, and to consider available motor vehicle safety data for this purpose.The statute provided that the agency finding must be supported by ``substantialevidence'' on the record of a formal rulemaking proceeding. The Court heldthat rescission of a motor vehicle safety standard was arbitrary and capricious.In that case, the agency had not shown an adequate factual basis for rescissionof the safety standard.In the present informal rulemaking, HUD is issuing regulations to implementthe 1983 law on public housing lease and grievance requirements. At thesame time, HUD is removing various pre-existing regulatory requirementsof the old lease and grievance rule, which are not mandated by the 1983law or any other law. The old rule was issued under HUD's broad authorityto issue regulations for programs administered by the Department (section7(d) of the HUD Act, 42 U.S.C. 3535(d)) (as well as other general rulemakingauthority no longer contained in the U.S. Housing Act of 1937) (see 40FR 33402, 33403, August 7, 1975).In the areas for which HUD is now removing old regulatory requirements,the present rulemaking differs fundamentally from the deregulation at issuein <T3>Motor Vehicles</T3>. HUD is authorized, but is not directed, to issueregulations for the HUD program. Both in the original promulgation of theold rule, and in the present rulemaking to revise or withdraw aspects ofthe old rule, HUD proceeds from a wide and flexible rulemaking authority.HUD has discretion to issue or withdraw a rule.In <T3>Motor Vehicles</T3>, the agency was required to adopt standards fora precise empirical purpose (motor vehicle safety) defined in the statute.In the present case, HUD has discretion, but no obligation, to issue regulationsreasonably necessary to promote purposes of the programs administered bythe Department.In <T3>Motor Vehicles</T3>, the agency was required by law to consider ``data''relevant to the stated statutory purpose, and to issue a finding supportedby ``substantial evidence''. By contrast, in the present rulemaking, HUDis not directed by law to consider any specific factors, to make a decisionbased on ``data'' or ``evidence'' respecting the factors, or to generatea formal administrative record of the rulemaking proceeding. An agencymay consider factors which are relevant to implementation of the particularenabling statutes under which a rule is issued. For HUD, there is widediscretion to decide what elements will be considered in a rulemaking forthe public housing program under the United States Housing Act of 1937,including the role of available studies or evidence.HUD has a plenary authority to modify or withdraw provisions of the oldrule, provided only that the agency action may not be ``arbitrary and capricious''.The regulatory action must be reasonably related to the purposes of theprogram. HUD's discretion is as broad for the present rulemaking as forpromulgation of the original 1975 rule. An agency is not subject to a heavierburden in seeking to deregulate or change an old rule, than for initialpromulgation of the rule. The regulation is not frozen in the form originallyissued. The Supreme Court has noted that ``regulatory agencies do not establishrules of conduct to last forever'' (<T3>American Trucking Asso. </T3>v. <T3>Atchison, </T3>387 U.S. 397, 416, 87 S. Ct. 1608, 1618 (1967)).In general thrust, this rulemaking seeks to deregulate that which needno longer be regulated, and to devolve to the individual PHA a far broaderauthority over the local public housing program. In <T3>Motor Vehicles</T3>, the Supreme Court remarked that while deregulationis ``not always or necessarily'' a sufficient basis for rescission of anexisting rule, ``it may be easier for an agency to justify a deregulatoryaction'' than to justify enactment of a new regulatory standard (463 U.S.at 42, 103 S. Ct. at 2866). The test in each case is whether the agencycan show a reasonable basis for the regulatory action.This Preamble gives a full explanation of general and particular reasonsfor each regulatory action.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Lease Provisions</ITAG>A. General<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Lease Requirements</ITAG>Lease requirements are simplified and clarified (Part 966, Subpart B).As under the old rule, this final rule describes the types of lease provisionswhich are required (andSection; 966.10) or prohibited (andSection; 966.11).The required and prohibited provisions concern central aspects of the subsidizedtenancy.The rule leaves the drafting of lease provisions which comply with theserequirements to the PHA. However, in keeping with historical practice inthe public housing program, the rule does not direct PHAs to use a formlease drafted by HUD. In addition to lease provision which are requiredby the HUD rule, the lease may ``contain other provisions which are determinedby the PHA and which are not inconsistent with [the HUD rule]'' (andSection;966.10(a)).Comments recommend various additions and changes, but do not challengethis general approach.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Comments: Objections to Deregulation</ITAG>Public comment from legal aid and tenant groups objects broadly to theelimination or revision of Federal lease requirements in the old rule,and objects specifically to amendment of particular lease requirements.Comment argues that proposed changes are unconstitutional, unfair or demeaningto tenants. Comment states that the proposed rule eliminates essentialtenant protections, and does not protect the tenant from arbitrary PHAaction. The proposed rule abdicates Federal power and vests discretionarypower in PHAs.HUD does not dispute that the rule reduces Federal interference in theprerogative of PHA management to develop and revise leases and PHA rulesfor public housing tenants. The rule enlarges the discretionary power vestedin the PHA, and correspondingly reduces Federal prescription of the detailsof public housing management, and of the relations between the PHA andthe tenant. The rulemaking is intended to simultaneously diminish excessFederal controls, and enhance the right and ability of the PHA to run thehousing for the benefit of the tenants. Because the lease is the basiccontractual instrument which regulates the rights and duties of the PHAand the tenant, the changes in Federal lease requirements allow importantand pervasive changes in the relationship between the PHA and tenant, andin day-to-day management of the housing.HUD does not agree that simplification of leasehold requirements unfairlyexposes the tenant to arbitrary PHA action, or deprives the tenant of essentialprotections. Comments which protest changes in Federal lease requirementsappear largely based on a visceral distrust of PHA autonomy, a sense thatthe PHA cannot be trusted to treat the tenant fairly, that the PHA musttherefore be tightly bound by detailed Federal rules for tenant protectionin daily management of public housing projects.HUD does not share this view of the PHA. The establishment of rigid andover-detailed Federal requirements, as under the old lease and grievancerule, is more likely to cause harsh, arbitrary and inefficient action bya PHA, than is a policy that allows the PHA discretion to react to localconditions and local desires, for example, by quickly adopting changesin PHA lease forms or PHA rules. Because of Federal regulation under theold rule, the PHA could not adapt quickly and flexibly to the needs ofthe tenants, and of effective management of public housing projects. Compliancewith Federal requirements is a burden on PHA management, a drain on availableadministrative and fiscal resources. The burden of compliance with Federalregulation may diminish or exhaust the capacity of PHA management to considerthe needs of individual tenants with compassion and consideration.The revised lease requirements continue to cover many of the most centralaspects of the subsidized tenancy. The lease requirements assure that provisionsof the public housing lease protect the essential interests of the publichousing tenant. These tenant protections include the lease provisions requiredunder the 1983 law (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(l), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)).A comment by the National Housing Law Project (``NHLP'') states that the1983 law requires PHAs to use the lease forms developed under the old rule,and that HUD's alterations of the lease requirements under the old ruleviolate a ``clear Congressional mandate''. This assertion is based on out-of-contextlanguage of the May 1983 report by the House authorizing committee, whichreports out the public housing lease requirements incorporated in the 1983law. The Report notes that the bill adds a new provisions under which HUDmust require PHAs to utilize fair leases. The House committee languagewhich is quoted in the NHLP comment states that ``the committee contemplatesthat HUD will meet this obligation by retaining the present regulations''(Report 98-123 on H.R. 1, p. 35). In context, it is plain that the committeeis only referring to certain specific lease requirements in the old rule,which are covered by the reported bill, and by the statute as enacted inthe 1983 law. The House committee report does not contain any languageto support an inference, as indicated by the NHLP comment, that the 1983law was intended to freeze all then-existing HUD requirements for publichousing leases.The House committee bill requires HUD to retain specific elements of thelease requirements under the old rule: the prohibition of leases whichcontain unreasonable terms and conditions (called prohibited lease provisions);the obligation to maintain the projects in decent, safe and sanitary condition;requirements for adequate notice of lease termination; and good cause groundsfor termination of tenancy (H.R. 1, section 206, reported May 13, 1983).These specific lease requirements were incorporated varbatim in the 1983law as enacted. The House committee report states (<T3>Id. </T3>at 36):<ITAG tagnum="21">Since 1970 HUD has prohibited PHAs from utilizing * * * unfair [lease]clauses * * *. The bill requires that those regulatory prohibitions beretained and that HUD prohibit any additional clauses which are unreasonable.Beyond prohibiting certain unfair clauses, the bill also requires the leasesto contain certain basic protections. They include clauses obliging PHAsto maintain the premises in decent, safe and sanitary condition, and toprovide adequate notice before evicting tenants. The committee also contemplatesthat HUD will retain the existing regulations regarding <T3>these provisions </T3>(emphasis supplied).</ITAG>Under the House bill and the 1983 law, HUD is required to retain specifictypes of lease provisions required the old rule. (In the proposed leaseand grievance rule published in December 1982, HUD had suggested the possibleelimination of a number of these provisions.) There was not, however, anybroad intention by the House committee, as claimed in the NHLP comment,to force PHAs to continue using leases developed under the old rule, orto bar HUD from changing lease requirements under the old rule. In anyevent, such intention would not be effective unless implemented in theactual statutory language. The actual language of the law as passed byCongress is very precise as to the elements which must be included in apublic housing lease. All of these statutory elements are implemented inthis rule. There is no statutory bar against changing other elements ofthe lease requirements in the old rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Deregulation: Other Comments</ITAG>Some comments urge that PHAs be permitted a greater freedom to determinelease provisions. There should be more local control. PHAs should be allowedto structure leases in accordance with State law. HUD should allow a PHAto include any desired provisions in the lease, if the lease is consistentwith State law.  HUD is sympathetic to the need for local autonomy. The rule is designedto strip away unnecessary Federal controls on the content of public housingleases. There are, however, legitimate reasons to prescribe minimum Federalrequirements for core provisions of a public housing lease.<ITAG tagnum="15">_First, Federal regulation is necessary to implement lease requirementsmandated by the 1983 law, such as the specification of prohibited leaseprovisions, and of statutory grounds for termination of tenancy.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Second, other lease provisions are needed to establish a tenancywhich reflects the statutory and regulatory character of a public housingtenancy, such a provision for determination of rent in accordance withHUD requirements (which are substantially dictated by Federal statute),and for periodic reexamination of family income for this purpose.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Third, some lease provisions_while not specifically required by statute_reflectspecific characteristics of a public housing tenancy, which are not generallycharacteristic of a private and unsubsidized tenancy under State law, suchas statement of conditions in which the family can be required to moveto another public housing unit, and statement of the obligations of anassisted family. For example, the lease prohibits the tenant from receivingother Federal housing subsidy and prohibits fraud in connection with aFederal housing assistance program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Fourth, some provisions establish other basic conditions of the subsidizedtenancy, for protection of public housing residents, and for protectionof the Federal subsidy investment in the housing. For example, the leaseprovides that the PHA must comply with local code requirements materiallyaffecting safety of the occupants; the PHA may only provide for a ``reasonable''security deposit and ``reasonable'' penalties for late payment of rentof charges; the tenant may only use the unit for residence by the household,and may not use the dwelling unit for unlawful purposes.</ITAG>In drafting the required lease provisions in this rule, there is consciousand consistent endeavor to minimize the extent of Federal regulation, bothas to the subjects covered and as to the amount of detail in the rule.The required provisions are stated in broad terms, which will protect therelevant Federal interest and concern, but with maximum freedom for thePHA to devise lease provisions which satisfy the general requirement. ThePHA has great freedom to draft lease provisions which accord with locallaw and with local practice and preference (cf., andSection; 966.10(a)).In the main, PHA comments approve the proposed HUD lease requirements,with some suggestions for particular improvements. (The suggestions willbe discussed below.) The lease revisions are fair and equitable to bothmanagement and tenant. The revisions promote efficiency, but retain withoutcompromise all essential elements of tenant rights. Comments state thatthe required lease provisions are clear and easy to understand, and approvestreamlining of required lease language. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Applicability of Lease Requirements  </ITAG>The lease requirements in Subpart B of Part 966 apply to ``public housing''andSection; 966.1(b)(1)). Public housing is defined in this rule (andSection;966.2) as housing assisted under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, except housingassisted under section 8 (rent subsidy) or section 17 (housing developmentor rental rehabilitation grants) or the 1937 Act. The term ``public housing''as defined in this rule includes housing assisted under the Leased Housingprograms under section 23 or section 10(c) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937before the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. (Because of aprinter's typographical error, the definition of ``public housing'' inthe July 1986 proposed rule is appended to the definition of the term ``family''.)The rule provides (andSection; 966.1(b)(2)) that the Subpart B lease requirementsdo not apply to Indian Housing (including Mutual Help and rental projectsof Indian Housing Authorities), or to the Turnkey III homeownership program. Comment recommends that the lease requirements should be applicable toTurkey III and Mutual Help projects, to Indian Housing Authority rentalprojects, to post-1974 section 23 and section 10(c) projects, and to PHA-ownedsection 8. The comment does not articulate the reasons for these recommendations.The recommendations are not adopted.  Unlike the public housing rental programs, the Turnkey III program andthe Mutual Help program (a program for Indians) use forms of homeownershipagreement drafted by HUD. The regulations and HUD form agreements for theseprograms give the occupant a lease with option to purchase, and definein detail in rights of the occupant respecting occupancy and purchase ofthe unit. There is no need for overlapping regulation governing the formof a lease in these programs.  Historically, Indian housing, including Indian housing rental projects,was not subject to HUD regulation of dwelling lease provisions. This separatetreatment reflects HUD's recognition of the special needs of the Indianhousing program. However, lease requirements in the 1983 law are applicableto Indian housing as to other public housing, since there is no statutoryexception. Therefore this rule adds provisions necessary to implement leaserequirements of the 1983 law for Indian rental projects (new andSection;905.303). These provisions are intended as the minimum necessary to complywith the statutory requirements for dwelling leases. The rule allows thegreatest possible room for Indian Housing Authorities to adapt the 1983statutory requirements to conditions of reservation or non-reservationIndian housing, including accommodation to tribal courts and tribal law.Comment recommends applying the lease requirements to post-1974 section23 or section 10(c) projects. There are no post-1974 section 23 or section10(c) projects. Section 10(c) and section 23 are sections of the versionof the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 before recodification in the Housing andCommunity Development Act of 1974.  There is no reason to apply the public housing lease requirements to asection 8 project which is owned by a PHA. First, section 8 is not subjectto the public housing lease amendments in the 1983 law. Lease requirementsin the 1983 law were enacted as section 6(l) of the U.S. Housing Act of1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)). Pursuant to section 8(h) of the 1937 Act (42U.S.C. 1437f(h)), section 6 of the Act does not apply to assistance undersection 8. Second, the statutory, regulatory and contractual structureof the section 8 rental assistance programs is very different from thepublic housing program for which the lease provisions are designed. Thereis also no reason to have different lease requirements if the section 8owner happens to be a PHA. Third, section 8 project owners, including PHA-owners,are required to use a HUD prescribed model lease. There is therefore noneed for overlapping regulation governing the form of section 8 lease.The present regulation only covers the public housing programs, and isissued by the HUD Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. Thesection 8 programs are within the jurisdiction of the HUD Assistant Secretaryfor Housing. B. PHA Obligations <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Maintenance </ITAG><T3>a. Duty to Maintain. </T3>The 1983 law provides that a public housinglease must ``obligate the public housing agency to maintain the projectin a decent, safe, and sanitary condition'' (U.S. Housing Act of 1937,section 6(l)(2), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(2)). The provision of ``decent, safe,and sanitary'' housing is the statutory purpose of the public housing program(U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 3(b)(1), 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(1)).The rule (andSection; 966.10(f)) states that a lease must provide that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The PHA shall provide services and maintenance for the dwellingunit, equipment and appliances, and for the common areas and facilities,which are needed to keep the housing in decent, safe and sanitary condition.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The PHA shall comply with the requirements of applicable Stateand local building or housing codes concerning matters materially affectinghealth or safety of the occupants.</ITAG>This formulation balances the statutory requirement to state in the leasethe PHA duty to maintain the unit, and the statutory aim of vesting localPHAs with the maximum amount of administrative responsibility (U.S. HousingAct of 1937, section 2, 42 U.S.C. 1437).The PHA has the contractual duty to maintain the unit in compliance withthe decent, safe and sanitary standard, as applied to circumstances inthe locality. This comprehensive obligation removes, however, the needfor HUD to require that the PHA include a detailed statement of PHA maintenanceobligations in the lease.<T3>b. Compliance with State Codes. </T3>The lease requirement to complywith State housing codes supplements the decent, safe and sanitary standard,and applies to code violations which risk the health and safety of thetenant. The PHA's duty to comply with State housing code requirements isenforceable by the tenant as a contractual duty of the PHA under the lease.In most cases, the PHA's breach of this obligation is also a violationof the PHA's duty to maintain the unit in decent, safe and sanitary condition.Local code violations which do not materially affect health or safety arenot enforceable by the tenant under the lease. The enforcement of localcode standards is in general appropriately left to the judgement of localofficials in the light of local conditions. The Department does not believethere is justification to impose on PHAs a blanket Federal regulatory requirementto incorporate in the lease with an individual tenant the PHA's obligationto comply with local code requirements. However, PHA violation of localcode conditions affecting health or safety are so fundamental, and so boundto achievement of decent, <T3>safe </T3>and sanitary housing, that the code violations are properlya subject of Federal regulation.PHA comment states that the PHA should only be required to maintain theunit in accordance with State or local law. A unit which complies withlocal code is decent, safe and sanitary. The comment would therefore removefrom the lease a separate requirement to maintain the unit in decent, safeand sanitary condition, as distinguished from the PHA's obligation to complywith local code.Legal aid comment states that the rule should retain the unit maintenancerequirements in the old rule. Erosion of minimum safety standards is illadvised and unnecessary. Existing standards were not onerous for PHAs.The final rule does not modify the proposed provisions expressing the PHAduty for maintenance of the unit.Compliance with local code overlaps with the duty to provide service andmaintenance needed to keep the housing in decent, safe and sanitary condition.Elements necesary to comply with code (e.g., concerning electrical wiringfor a unit) may also be necessary so that the unit is decent, safe andsanitary. Depending on comprehensiveness of the local code, and on whetherthe code is applicable to a public housing unit, satisfaction of localcode may also constitute satisfaction of the requirement to keep the housingin decent, safe and sanitary condition.However, the lease must state, as directed by the 1983 law, that the PHAis obligated to maintain the unit in decent, safe and sanitary condition.This obligation is not wholly subsumed in the PHA's duty to comply withlocal code, and must be separately expressed in the lease. A communitymay lack a housing code, or the code may not embrace all elements of serviceand maintenance necessary to assure that the unit is decent, safe and sanitary.Code may not establish a continuing requirement governing status of existingunits, as opposed to requirements imposed when a unit is built, or as acondition for initial grant of a certificate of occupancy. A local codemay not be applied or interpreted in a way that satisfies the PHA's maintenanceobligations under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. For a variety of reasons,compliance with local code is not always or necessarily equivalent to maintainingthe unit in decent, safe and sanitary condition.In a locality where compliance with local code signifies that the unitis decent, safe and sanitary, a lease provision which requires the PHAto maintain the unit up to this standard does not, in principle, subjectthe PHA to any additional contractual burden. We acknowledge, however,that there is a potential for legal dispute between the PHA and the tenantas to whether compliance with local code satisfies the Federal statutorystandard as stated in the lease.HUD does not agree with comment which claims that the simplification oflease requirements somehow erodes or or diminishes safety standards inthe old rule. The requirement that the PHA must provide services and maintenancerequired for ``safe'' operation of the housing is simply and explicitlystated in the lease, as is the requirement to comply with local codes affecting``health and safety''. The PHA obligation is comprehensively stated, inthe language mandated by the 1983 law. There is no reason to add redundantlease verbiage on the subject of tenant safety. Most important, we do notbelieve that the housing will be made safer by adding more wordage to thelease.Under the lease, a PHA must comply with local code on matters ``materiallyaffecting the health or safety of the occupants''. Comment states thata PHA should be obliged to comply with all code requirements, not merelywith requirements affecting health and safety. Another comment objectsthat the PHA lease obligation is restricted to matters ``materially'' affectinghealth or safety.These comments miss the reason for using State code requirements as thebasis for establishing PHA obligations under the lease. The purpose isnot to empower the tenant to treat all technical violations of local codeas violations of the lease. The purpose is to focus on that aspect of localcode enforcement which is most directly related to the Federal statutorymission of the public housing program, and is most critically related tothe welfare of the public housing tenants. Independent of the lease, localcode enforcement authorities have all of the normal powers to enforce coderequirements against the PHA in accordance with local law. Moreover, Stateshave the power, if they wish, to grant public housing or other tenantsa procedure and standing to enforce local code requirements. The Stateand locality have the primary role of deciding how to enforce a code schemewhich is a creature of State and local choice. Except for specific purposesof the public housing program, HUD has no reason to interfere in the localprocedures for enforcement of local code.Local codes may reflect local policies which have little to do with nationalpolicies of the public housing program, or as to which there is no immediatereason for Federal involvement or concern. For example, local code mayinclude elements designed to implement local land use controls, or to encourageuse of local labor (by requiring use of stick built techniques, or by prohibitinguse of new materials or construction techniques). For the present purpose,we merely assert that local concerns and interests as reflected in thelocal code are not automatically the business of the Federal government,to be enforced by the tenant through provisions of the public housing lease.Finally, the Federal interest in enforcement of local code requirementsthrough the public housing lease should only apply when there is ``material''violation of local requirements related to health or safety of the occupants.The purpose of the lease provision is not to capture any technical codeviolation marginally related to tenant safety, but those violations whichare likely to result in serious injury to the tenants. The pursuit of minorviolations of local code is best left to the enforcement policies and techniquesof the local authorities. (The rule provision on compliance with localcode is substantially identical to a parallel provision of the UniformResidential Landlord and Tenant Act. Uniform Act, section 2.104(a)(1).)<T3>c. PHA Obligation When Unit is Dangerous_</T3>(1) PHA Duty to OfferSubstitute Unit. The final rule provides (andSection; 966.10(f)(3)):<ITAG tagnum="21">If the condition of the dwelling unit is hazardous to the health orsafety of the occupants, and the condition is not corrected in a reasonabletime, the PHA shall offer the Tenant a replacement dwelling unit if available.The PHA is not required to offer the Tenant a replacement unit if the hazardouscondition was caused by fault or negligence of Household members, or ofguests, visitors, or other persons under control of Household members.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">These provisions reflect the Federal interest in correcting conditionswhich may endanger health or safety of public housing residents.The new rule provides that the PHA must offer a replacement unit if a hazardouscondition is not corrected ``in a reasonable time''. The new rule doesnot require that the PHA offer the tenant a public housing unit.Comment states that the PHA should not be allowed a ``reasonable'' timeto fix the hazardous conditions. The comment points out that what is ``reasonable''to a PHA employee may not be reasonable for a tenant suffering a hazardouscondition. HUD appreciates that the perspective of the tenant naturallydiffers from the perspective of PHA officials. The tenant may have difficultycapturing attention of PHA officials, or persuading them that the unitis dangerous and that the tenant should be offered a new unit. Nevertheless,HUD has not revised the rule in response to this comment. To a considerabledegree, the decision on what to do if there is a dangerous condition inthe unit should be left to the discretion and good sense of the PHA. ThePHA decision should be based on the immediate facts of the case, and thePHA resources on hand. The decision is not readily reducible to a moreprecise formula, that should be incorporated in the boilerplate of publichousing leases.The statement of tenant obligations under the lease is revised to providethat the tenant must move from a dangerous dwelling unit (andSection; 966.10(h)(1)(v)(B)).Thus the revised rule defines the correlative duties of the PHA and thetenant in a situation where the tenant's original unit is no longer safefor continued occupancy. The PHA must offer a replacement dwelling unitif available, and the tenant must move.Comment states that the PHA should not be required to relocate the tenantif dangerous conditions in the unit were caused by action or negligenceof the family or its guests (such as a fire caused by the family; leaksnot reported to the PHA; hazards resulting from the family's housekeepinghabits). The tenant should be evicted, not relocated to destroy anotherunit. In response to the comment, the rule is amended by specifying thatthe PHA is not required to offer the tenant a replacement unit if the dangerouscondition in the unit was caused by fault or negligence of the householdmembers, or of guests, visitors or other persons under the control of householdmembers (andSection; 966.10(f)(3)). The PHA may evict the family if the familyactions which caused the damage are grounds for termination of tenancy(serious or repeated violation of the lease or other good cause; see andSection;966.21). It should also be noted that on normal contractual principles,a tenant's breach of the lease (by damage to the unit) may relieve thePHA of reciprocal obligations to the tenant under the lease, such as thepromise to offer replacement housing.(2) Abatement of Rent. The old rule provided that if the PHA does not correctdangerous conditions in a reasonable time, rent must be abated ``in proportionto the seriousness of the damage and loss in value as a dwelling * * *''HUD proposed to delete the requirement for abatement of rent. Comment statesthat the lease should allow or require abatement for hazardous or substandardconditions. Abatement is an effective and cheap non-judicial mechanismto resolve disputes. The proposed change eliminates a valuable and easily-administeredremedy for serious health and safety problems. Abatement enables the tenantto get the attention of a recalcitrant and non-responsive PHA. Eliminatingthe tenant's right to abate rent for dangerous conditions removes an incentivefor management to maintain the property, and puts the tenant family atrisk. Abatement is legally and morally justified if the PHA does not renderservices for which the tenant has paid. Abatement of rent encourages lessorsto maintain property. The rule should encourage the PHA to repair publichousing units, and should discourage the PHA from transferring the tenantfrom a dangerous unit.Comment notes that the abatement remedy (as defined under the law of aparticular State) is not useful. The comment thus implies that the Federalregulations should establish a Federal right to abatement in addition toany right of abatement under State law. Other comment states that a PHAshould be held responsible for compliance with the same standards as aprivate landlord. Abatement is a principal tool to enforce health and buildingcodes.The final rule is silent on the tenant's right to rent abatement to remedya breach of PHA obligations under the lease. The rule also does not requirethat the lease include a provision which abates the rent for hazardousor substandard conditions, or which establishes a standard for computingthe amount of an abatement.Abatement is a two edged sword. If rent is abated or withheld, the PHAloses revenue that would otherwise be available for projection operation.Denial of revenue may force the PHA to reduce maintenance and other tenantservices. Denial of PHA income, by abatement or other rent withholdingtechniques may accelerate a downward spiral of project management and maintenance,where each reduction of rental income leads to reduction of necessary tenantmaintenance, and the reduction of maintenance leads to additional withholding.The deterioration of project services affects tenants who pay the rent,as well as those who initially claim that there is justification for refusingto pay the full rent claimed by the PHA. This deterioration may in turnlead to withholding by more and more tenants. This may also occur becausetenants who pay rent are naturally infected by the example of other tenantswho, rightly or wrongly, claim a right to deny full payment of the rent.Comment states that HUD should not take away the tenant's right to abatementof rent under State law. Comment claims that in most States, eliminationof a Federal abatement requirement conflicts with the State law warrantyof habitability. Because abatement may result in severe and harmful effects on managementof the housing, HUD is unable to justify restoration of a Federal rightto abatement of the rent. However, the rule does not prohibit or preemptauthority for abatement under State statute or caselaw. Absent a Federalrequirement or prohibition, the existence or non-existence of a right toabatement is determined by State law. The Federal rule does not take awaya right to abatement under State law, and does not interfere with a Statelaw warranty of habitability. Federal requirements governing the form of a public housing tenancy coexistwith State-law requirements which spell out incidents of the tenancy, solong as the State requirements do not contradict requirements of the Federalstatute and rule. The State law may not destroy or diminish rights of thetenant and the PHA under the Federal rule, but may add additional tenantprotections, such as a right to rent abatement as a remedy for breach ofPHA obligations in the lease. The rule allows but does not require abatementof rent. The rule therefore defers to State policy, as expressed in Statelaw, concerning the right of the tenant to abate rent as a remedy for PHAbreach. If a tenant may abate rent for any landlord, including a publiclandlord, the tenant may also abate rent payable to a PHA. Comment asserts that the rule should provide that a PHA must comply withremedies under State law for the PHA's failure to maintain the unit. HUDconcludes, however, that there is no sufficient justification for federalizingState remedies. State remedies reflect values and policies in the jurisdiction,not necessarily the purposes of the national public housing program. HUDshould not blindly incorporate local remedies into lease requirements forthe national public housing program. A jurisdiction which establishes aright to remedies under State law may likewise establish procedures toeffectuate the remedies, including a requirement that the remedies mustbe incorporated in the lease. The 1983 law requires a lease provision which obligates the PHA to maintainthe unit in decent, safe and sanitary condition (U.S. Housing Act of 1937,section 6(l)(2), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(2)). A comment claims the 1983 lawdoes not authorize HUD to eliminate the tenant's right to abatement underthe old rule, asserting that the 1983 law requires HUD to retain the leaserequirements of the old rule. The new rule provides that the PHA must provide services and maintenance,for the dwelling unit, equipment and appliances, and for the common areasand facilities, which are needed to keep the housing in decent, safe andsanitary condition (andSection; 966.10(f)(1)). This provision constitutesliteral and complete implementation of the 1983 law, and is substantivelysimilar to parallel provisions of the old rule. Nothing in the text ofthe 1983 law freezes the lease requirements precisely as framed in theold rule. Nothing in the 1983 law requires inclusion of provision of rentabatement, or requires retention of rent abatement provisions that werecontained in the old rule. <T3>d. Maintenance by Tenant. </T3>The rule (andSection; 966.10(j)) statesthat:<ITAG tagnum="21">The lease may provide that the Tenant shall perform seasonal maintenanceor other maintenance tasks, as specified in the lease, where performanceof such tasks by tenants of dwelling units of a similar design and constructionis customary; provided, that such provision is included in the lease ingood faith and not for the purpose of evading the obligation of the PHA.The PHA shall exempt the Tenant if the PHA determines that because of ageor physical disability members of the Household are unable to perform suchtasks.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This provision is substantially drawn from a parallel provision ofthe old rule. Comment argues that HUD should delete the rule provision which allows aPHA to require the tenant to perform ``customary'' maintenance. Maintenanceis a PHA function. The PHA should not be allowed to shift this maintenanceresponsibility to the tenant. The comment also observes that the regulationstandard for when maintenance may be shifted to the tenant (i.e., the practicewhich is ``customary'' in dwelling units of similar design and construction)is too vague, and should be spelled out in the rule. Under the lease provisions mandated by the 1983 law, the basic responsibilityfor maintenance of the project rests with the PHA. The lease must ``obligatethe public housing agency to maintain the project in a decent, safe, andsanitary condition'' (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(l)(2), 42 U.S.C.1437d(l)(2)). However, this allocation of responsibility for maintenanceof the project under the statute does not mean that the tenant may notbe required to perform unit maintenance tasks which help the PHA maintainthe project in decent, safe and sanitary condition. If the tenant mustperform maintenance for the unit, the tenant may be more likely to cleanand care for the unit, and less likely to damage the unit, than if thetenant is the passive recipient of all PHA maintenance services. Each individualtenant is a beneficiary of the PHA duty to maintain the project. In meetingthis responsibility, the PHA may be supported by the requirement for alltenants to perform certain maintenance responsibilities respecting theirindividual units. The required lease provisions in the 1983 law were enacted verbatim inthe form previously reported by the House Banking Committee, and then passedby the House of Representatives (unlike the grievance procedures, for whichthe law as enacted differs markedly from the Bill previously reported bythe House). The Report by the House Banking Committee notes that the reportedbill includes a clause obliging the PHA to maintain the premises in decent,safe and sanitary condition. The Report states that ``the Committee * ** contemplates that HUD will retain the existing regulations regardingthese provisions'' (Report 98-123 on H.R. 1, p. 36). Under the ``existingregulations'' (i.e., the old lease and grievance rule) a requirement forthe PHA to ``maintain the premises and the project in decent, safe andsanitary condition'' co-exists with authority for a lease provision inwhich the tenant agrees to perform maintenance tasks ``according to localcustom''. Thus the 1983 law is not intended to sweep aside the potentialfor lease provisions which require the tenant to perform maintenance tasksin accordance with local custom. The new rule provides, as did the old rule, that an agreement for the tenantto perform maintenance tasks must be included in ``good faith'' and notfor the purpose of evading the PHA obligation for maintenance of the project.The PHA right to transfer maintenance responsibilities to the tenant isnot open-ended, but depends on local landlord-tenant practice. The designationof tasks to be performed by the tenant must be customary for units of similardesign and construction in the locality. Because this contractual standarddepends on tenancy practices in each locality, the definition of what practiceis ``customary'' is not stated in the HUD regulation, but depends on aconcrete examination of local practice. Comment states that the HUD rule should specify that a PHA may not shifttasks to the tenant if the tasks must be performed by the landlord underlocal law. This comment is not well taken. The HUD rule does not overridea local law which requires the landlord to perform specific maintenancetasks. The PHA must exempt the tenant from tenant maintenance tasks if membersof the household are not able to perform the tasks ``because of age orphysical disability'' (andSection; 966.10(j)). A PHA states that a PHA shouldnot be required to exempt elderly or handicapped from tenant maintenancerequirements, such as mowing, if the PHA has elderly or handicapped units,but the tenant wants to live in an area where tenant maintenance is required.The comment is not adopted. It is not fair or practicable to impose a maintenancerequirement on the tenant if members of the household cannot perform themaintenance because of age or disability. The tenant would have to findother persons to perform the tasks, or would be placed in violation ofthe lease. The tenant may not be able to find or pay someone to performthe tenant maintenance obligation. The PHA may consider the ability of the tenant to perform tenant maintenancewhen deciding whether to admit the tenant to a tenant maintenance unit.In addition, if a tenant is already living in a unit, but there is no householdmember who can perform tenant maintenance tasks appropriate for the unit,the PHA may determine that the unit is inappropriate for the householdcomposition, and require the tenant to move to another public housing unit(andSection; 966.10(h)(1)(v)(A)(1)). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. PHA Duty to Comply with Federal and State Requirements </ITAG>Comment states that a lease should provide that a PHA must comply withFederal law and HUD regulations, including requirements for calculationof rent and utility allowances. In HUD's view, the comment fails to justifyimporting HUD requirements wholesale into the lease between the PHA anda tenant, to be enforced as a contractual duty of the PHA to the tenantunder the public housing lease. Required lease provisions are only a vehicleto express basic responsibilities of the PHA to the tenant. The lease provisions which are required by the 1983 law regulate key aspectsof the assisted tenancy, but do not contemplate that the tenant must havea contractual leasehold right to enforce all statutory and regulatory dutiesof the PHA across the board. For some HUD regulations, the right to enforcementmay be vested in HUD's administrative discretion, but not in the tenant.For other HUD regulations, the tenant may have a direct right of actionoutside of the lease, to demand benefits owing to the tenant from the PHA.Existence of this right against the PHA does not depend on incorporationin the lease (cf., <T3>Wright v. Roanoke, </T3>479 U.S.__, 107 S. Ct. 766 (1987)). With respect to rent, the rule provides that the rent ``shall be determinedby the PHA in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements'' (andSection;966.10(c)). Conversely, the tenant may not be required to pay a rent whichis not determined in accordance with HUD requirements. The proposed rule provided that a lease must be ``in accordance with Stateand local law''. This provision is not contained in the final rule. Ingeneral, State and local law independently determines whether State andlocal law is applicable to a public housing tenancy, and whether the Staterequirements must be included in the lease. Comment states that the rule should provide that State tenant protectionscontrol if State protections conflict with requirements under the Federalrule. This recommendation is not adopted. The tenancy must comply withall requirements of this rule. Tenant will have all the leasehold rightsprovided under the HUD rule, and any additional rights afforded by Stateand local law.C. Tenant Obligations <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Statement of Tenant Obligations </ITAG>The lease states the key tenant responsibilities concerning use of theunit and behavior of family members and family guests (andSection; 966.10(h)).The statement is expanded and clarified from the treatment of this subjectin the old rule. Regulations for the section 8 existing housing certificate program statefamily obligations under that program (andSection; 882.118; cf. also, andSection;882.210). Like the public housing program, the section 8 certificate programis run by local PHAs. In the certificate program, the roles of the PHAand owner are separate. In the public housing program, these roles arecombined. Thus the statement of tenant obligations may be roughly dividedinto: (1) Items reflecting the common PHA role in the public housing andhousing certificate programs, and (2) items reflecting the obligationsof the tenant to the PHA as owner of a public housing dwelling unit. For the first group of items, the statement of tenant obligations in thisrule is substantially conformed for the public housing and housing certificateprograms (with some technical differences): Requirement to use the dwellingunit for family residence (andSection; 966.10(h)(1)(i)(A)), prohibition againsttransferring use of the unit (andSection; 966.10(h)(1)(ii)), duty to givenecessary information to PHA (andSection; 966.10(h)(1)(iv)), agreement notto commit fraud in connection with a Federal housing assistance program(andSection; 966.10(h)(2)(v) and andSection; 966.10(h)(3)(i)), prohibitionof duplicative Federal housing assistance (andSection; 966.10(h)(2)(vi)).In the public housing program, these provisions are contained in the lease,and serious or repeated breach of tenant lease obligations is ground fortermination of tenancy (see andSection; 966.21). General comments note that the statement of tenant obligations in the ruleis fair to both the PHA and tenant. The following sections of this Preamble discuss aspects of tenant obligationsunder the lease:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Crime or other violation of law. Section III.C.2. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Damage or disturbance. Section III.C.3. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Responsibility for third party acts. Section III.C.4. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Guests.

Violation of Law by Household Members </ITAG><T3>a. Violation of State Law As Ground for Termination of Tenancy. </T3>Commentstates that the PHA should be permitted to terminate tenancy for violationof ``applicable'' Federal, State or local law. The comment asserts thatdenying enforcement against a resident who violates the law is bureaucraticinterference with autonomy of local agency practices, and impedes the effortsof the PHA to protect law-abiding residents. Federal law prohibits termination of the public housing tenancy ``exceptfor serious or repeated violation of the terms or conditions of the leaseor for other good cause'' (section 6(l)(4) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937as amended by the 1983 law, 42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(4)). Tenant violation ofapplicable law is not a separate statutory ground for termination of tenancy,but may be a ground for termination of tenancy if the violation of lawis also a serious or repeated lease violation, or is ``other good cause''for termination of tenancy. The rule provides (andSection; 966.10(h)(1)(iii)) that the tenant must ``complywith any State or local law which imposes obligations on a tenant <T3>in connection with the occupancy of a dwelling unit and surroundingpremises'' </T3>(emphasis added) (no change from proposed rule). This requirementis included in the statement of tenant obligations under the lease. Thusviolation of this provision is a violation of the lease, and is groundfor termination of tenancy if the violation is either serious or repeated.The tenant lease obligation under this provision pertains only to Stateand local laws which impose obligations on a tenant in connection withoccupancy of the unit and premises. Comments objects that this provision only applies to violation of Statelaw which imposes obligations on a tenant, and that the provision may onlyallow termination of tenancy for violation of State law on project premises.There should be no distinction between violation of law committed on projectgrounds or off site (such as homicide in a public park). HUD agrees thatthe PHA needs, and this rule provides (andSection; 966.10(i)), clear authorityto terminate tenancy for violent crime or drug-dealing by family members,both on and off the project site. However, the present provision (andSection;966.10(h)(1)(iii)) is only directed at obligations imposed by State lawon a tenant. Other provisions of the rule and lease deal particularly withresponsibility for criminal actions by family members on or off the projectsite. (See discussion at section III.C.2.b of this Preamble.) The rule allows termination of tenancy for breach of a State law whichimposes tenant obligations in connection with the unit and project. Commentsuggests, as an alternative formulation, that the rule should allow terminationof tenancy for law violation which significantly affects health and safetyof PHA tenants. HUD believes that this alternative is too narrow, and wouldbe hard to apply. The PHA would be forced to prove the existence of a significanteffect, as well as a simple breach of the State law. The suggestion isnot adopted. Comment claims that to satisfy <T3>due process </T3>a termination for violation of State or local lawmust be based on a material violation which significantly affects livabilityof the property, or the health or safety of tenants. The Department findsno Constitutional basis for this assertion. The substantive standard fortermination of tenancy is not prescribed by the Constitution. A terminationfor violation of State or local law concerning occupancy of the dwellingunit or premises is reasonably related to the PHA's statutory and contractualresponsibilities for management of the housing.Comment asserts that the tenant should be obligated to comply with allapplicable law, including both statute and caselaw. The rule (andSection;966.10(h)(1)(iii))requires the tenant to comply with any State or local law which regulatestenant behavior concerning occupancy of the housing. The legal obligationunder State or local law may arise from any binding source of law, includingstatute, regulation or caselaw.<T3>b. Tenant Responsibility for Crime_</T3>(1) Lease Language. In developmentof this final rule, HUD has reexamined and substantially revised leaseprovisions about responsibility of the tenant for criminal acts by membersof the family and other persons. In accordance with section 6(c)(4)(C)of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437d(c)(4)(C)), thelease provisions are intended to help ``assure that satisfactory standardsof tenant security and project maintenance are formulated and that thepublic housing agency * * * enforces those standards fully and effectively.* * *'' The lease language will provide a strong contractual basis foraction by the PHA against a tenant who uses the unit or project for criminalactivity, or whose household members commit crimes of physical violenceor trade in narcotics, on or off project grounds. Full and effective enforcementby the PHA of the family's responsibility for criminal acts under the leaseis an important tool in the struggle against public housing crime.Control of crime in public housing is one of the most urgent issues forpublic housing residents and managers. The fear and fact of crime havea profound and destructive effect on life in public housing projects. Residentsare targets of crime and terror by other residents. Family members sufferviolence and intimidation. Units are burglarized and damaged. Crime inpublic housing leads to the disintegration of project and family life.The required lease language in the old rule provides that the tenant mustrefrain from ``illegal activity which impairs the physical or social environmentof the project'' (old rule andSection;966.4(f)(12)). The language in theproposed rule provides that the tenant ``shall not use the dwelling unitfor unlawful purposes, [or] engage in or permit unlawful activities inthe unit or project * * *'' (proposed rule andSection;966.10(g)(3)).Under the final rule, the lease must provide that the tenant and othermembers of the household ``shall not engage in criminal activity in thedwelling unit or premises, and shall prevent criminal activity in the unitor premises by guests, visitors, or other persons under control of Householdmembers'' (andSection;966.10(h)(2)(iii)). In addition to the required leaselanguage, the final rule clarifies (andSection;966.10(i)(1)) that a PHA mayinclude optional lease provisions which state that:<ITAG tagnum="21">any of the following criminal activities by any Household member,<T3>on or off the premises, </T3>shall be a violation of the lease, orother good cause for termination of tenancy:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Any <T3>crime of physical violence </T3>to persons or property.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) illegal use, sale or distribution of <T3>narcotics. </T3>(Emphasis supplied.)</ITAG>Finally, the rule provides (andSection;966.10(i)(2)) that the PHA may terminatetenancy for criminal activity, and consequently may evict members of thehousehold, ``before or after conviction of the crime''.(2) Prohibited Criminal Activity._The final rule contains a broad and simpleprohibition of ``criminal activity'' in the dwelling unit or ``premises''.Family members may not engage in criminal activity, and must prevent criminalactivity by third parties under control of the family (andSection;966.10(h)(2)(iii)).The final rule refers to ``criminal'' activity, rather than ``illegal''(old rule) or ``unlawful'' (proposed rule) activity.In the old rule, the prohibition only applied to illegal activity which``impairs the physical and social environment of the project''. This limitationis not included in the new rule. The old language is too vague, and createsuncertainty as to what kinds of crime are covered. To terminate tenancyunder the old standard, the PHA must, in principle, demonstrate two elements:That there was illegal activity, and that the activity somehow ``impairsthe physical and social environment''. Under the new rule, the PHA onlyhas to demonstrate that there was on-site crime attributable to the family.The rule does not otherwise describe or restrict the types of on-site crimecovered by the prohibition. HUD assumes that in practice PHAs most oftenwant to evict tenants for crimes that cause harm to residents or PHA employees,or which cause damage to project property. The PHA is most concerned withcrimes that affect the PHA.The distinction between a misdemeanor and a felony under State or Federalcriminal codes is also not a useful way to designate crimes which constitutea violation of the lease. The line between misdemeanor and felony may bedifferent in different jurisdictions, and some jurisdictions may use otherschemes or terminology to distinguish between lesser and greater crimes.A distinction between termination for acts of greater and lesser importanceis built into the general statutory standard for termination of tenancy.The prohibition of ``criminal activity'' in the unit or project appliesboth to a single crime (such as a mugging) and an ongoing pattern of criminalactivity (such as use of the unit for manufacture, distribution or saleof drugs). The family may be evicted for ``serious or repeated'' leaseviolations. If the PHA seeks to evict for a single crime, the PHA mustpersuade the court that the single crime is a serious violation of thelease. As in other cases where the PHA seeks to evict for a ``serious''lease violation, the court will apply the general standard for terminationof tenancy against the facts of the particular case.Language of the proposed rule would prohibit use of the unit for ``unlawfulpurposes'' and would also prohibit the PHA from engaging in or permitting``unlawful activities''. For a prohibition of on-site crime, the distinctionbetween ``purposes'' and ``activities'' is both unclear and unnecessary.The final rule prohibits criminal ``activity''. The tenant is not evictedfor having unlawful ``purposes'' but for engaging in some concrete criminalactivity (accompanied by the <T3>mens rea </T3>for the particular crime).(3) Third Party Crime. Under the new rule (andSection;966.10(h)(2)(iii)),the lease provides that the tenant must ``prevent criminal activity inthe unit or premises by guests, visitors, or other persons under controlof Household members''. The tenant's responsibility for third party criminalacts under this lease provision only applies to third party criminal activity``in the dwelling unit or premises''. (See section III.C.2.b.(4) concerningresponsibility for on or  off-site crime by a member of the public housingfamily.)The old rule provides that the tenant must refrain from illegal activities.However, there is no explicit provision that the tenant is responsiblefor illegal activity by a third party on the premises with the tenant'sconsent. There are provisions which make the tenant responsible for damageby family guests (andSection;andSection;966.4(f) (9) and (10) of old rule),and for disruptive conduct by other persons on the premises with the tenant'sconsent (andSection;966.4(f)(11) of old rule).PHA comment states that the tenant should be responsible for acts by familyfriends and guests. HUD agrees that the rule should strengthen the contractualresponsibility of the tenant for crime and other harmful on-site activityby third parties present on the premises by choice of the family. The existenceof contractual responsibility under the lease fortifies a family's incentivenot to invite third parties for criminal purposes (e.g., a drug dealer),and the family's incentive to stop guests from committing crimes in theproject.For further discussion of tenant responsibility for acts of third parties,see section III.C.4 of Preamble below.(4) Off-site Crime by Family Members. In some circumstances, off-site criminalacitvity by family members is a proper ground for termination of tenancy.First, off-site crime by a public housing resident may directly affectthe public housing project, and the lives of other project residents. Forexample, a tenant may sell narotics to another tenant. The effect on thepurchaser and the project is substantively the same if the transactiontakes place on project property or across the street. To protect publichousing projects from criminal activity, serious criminal activity shouldnot be insulated from contractual sanction because of a technicality_thatthe criminal act or transaction took place over the project boundary.Second, off-site crime is a basis for termination and eviction becausethe pattern of off-site behavior may be extended to the project, and istherefore a legitimate management concern of the PHA. At the point of admission,PHAs are authorized to bar admission of applicants whose habits and practicesare expected to have a detrimental effect on the project (andSection; 960.204(b)(2)).The PHA may consider a history of criminal activity involving crimes ofphysical violence to persons or property (andSection; 960.205(b)(3)). Thelogic behind these concerns at the point of admission applies equal tocriminal activity by members of families already admitted to the project.In addition to the broad prohibition of on-site crime by family membersor guests, the final rule adds a new provision (andSection; 966.10(i)(1))authorizing the PHA to include a lease provision allowing eviction of afamily for two categories of on-site or off-site criminal activity by afamily member: (1) ``a crime of physical violence to persons or property''or (2) ``illegal use, sale or distribution of narcotics.'' At the electionof the PHA, the lease may provide that such criminal activity by a familymember_on or off the premises_is a violation of the lease, or is othergood cause for termination of tenancy.(5) Relation Between Eviction and Criminal Prosecution. PHA comment statesthat if a family member commits a crime the PHA should be able to terminatethe tenancy before a conviction in the criminal prosecution. If not, thecriminal can continue to prey on other tenants. Other comment objects toeviction for criminal acts when no arrest or conviction has yet occured.The final rule adds a new provision (andSection; 966.10(i)(2)) which confirms(as stated in the Preamble to the proposed rule, 51 FR 26506, col. 3) thata PHA may terminate tenancy and evict the family for criminal activity``before or after conviction of the crime''. The PHA may evict for violationof the required lease prohibition concerning on-site crime by a familyor its guests, or for violation of an optional lease provision allowingtermination for off-site crime (narcotic violation or crime of violence).Comment asks for confirmation in the rule text and lease that the PHA mayevict for criminal activity irrespective of the existence or stage of acriminal prosecution for the criminal act.If criminal acts are grounds for termination of tenancy, the PHA does nothave to delay going forward with a civil proceeding for termination oftenancy and eviction pending the progress of a criminal prosecution relatingto the same set of facts. The PHA may proceed with a civil action to terminatetenancy, and may evict the family because of criminal behavior by familymembers, regardless of whether a prosecution has commenced, and regardlessof the stage of a criminal proceeding. Of course, the tenant is entitledto a fair hearing on the existence of grounds for termination of tenancy,in the PHA's administrative grievance procedure, or in the judicial actionfor eviction.In a criminal prosecution, court decision may lead to imprisonment or othercriminal penalty, and the elements of the crime must be proved by a criminalstandard of proof. However, eviction of a public housing tenant is a civilremedy (andSection; 966.23(a)). Decision of the court in the action for dispossessionof the tenant may lead to eviction from the unit. If the PHA alleges thatcommission of a ``crime'' by a household member is a lease violation orother good cause for termination of tenancy, then the PHA must prove theelements of crime by the civil standard of proof used in an eviction proceeding(generally by a preponderance of the evidence). There is no injustice ordenial of proper process by allowing the PHA to proceed with civil evictionbefore conviction of the crime.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Prohibited Conduct or Use of Unit</ITAG><T3>a. Damage or Destruction. </T3>The final rule provides (andSection; 966.10(h)(2)(ii))that the tenant and other members of the household:<ITAG tagnum="21">shall not damage or destroy the dwelling unit or premises, and shallprevent such damage or destruction by guests, visitors, or other personsunder control of Household members.</ITAG>Destruction of property by the tenant, family or guests is expensive forthe PHA, and may lead to destruction of the project as a decent place tolive.

Responsibility of Tenant for Acts of Third Parties</ITAG>This section discusses when the tenant is responsible for disturbance,damage or crime by persons other than members of the household.Comment states that the family should be responsible for conduct of anythird party in the unit. Comment states that in most cases where a thirdparty damages property, disturbs the neighbors or commits illegal acts,the tenant is an accessory, not an innocent bystander. Almost all burglaryand vandalism is by persons invited by the family. Other comment statesthat the tenant should not be responsible for third party acts if the tenantexercised reasonable care to prevent harm or injury. Comment states thatthe tenant should not be treated as a guarantor of conduct by third personson the premises (e.g., the pizza delivery man). The tenant should onlybe responsible for actions which are under the control of the family.The old rule provides that the tenant must ``cause his guests'' to refrainfrom damaging the unit or project (old rule andSection; 966.1(f)(9)), andmust ``cause other persons who are on the premises with his consent'' notto disturb peaceful enjoyment by neighbors (andSection; 966.1(f)(11)). Underthe old rule, the prohibition of illegal acts by the tenant (andSection;966.1(f)(12)) does not refer to commission of illegal acts by third parties.Thus the old rule does not contain a single consistent formulation of thetenant's responsibility for third party acts. Under the old rule, the tenantis not answerable for illegal acts by third parties, but has a positiveobligation to ``cause'' third parties to act in a way that avoids damageor disturbance. In the latter case, there are different regulatory descriptionsof the class of third party actors for whom the tenant is responsible.In the proposed rule, HUD offered a new formulation of the PHA responsibilityfor third party acts. The proposed language was based on language of themultifamily model lease (used for some of the non-public housing project-basedsubsidy programs). Under the proposed lease language, the family may notengage in or ``permit'' disturbance or unlawful acts. This provision wasintended to make the tenant responsible for acts or damage by family guestsor persons under control of the family (51 FR 26507, July 23, 1986).Language of the proposed rule would change the tenant obligation from aresponsibility to ``cause'' appropriate behavior by third parties underthe old rule lease, to an obligation not to ``permit'' injurious acts.Legal aid comment states that the proposed change is an improvement overthe old rule. The tenant is often unable to control third party acts. However,the comment also notes concern that the word ``permit'' is vague and ambiguous.Comment objects to the proposed change based on the multifamily model lease.A comment states that the change from ``cause'' to ``permit'' will do immeasurableharm to a PHA which is attempting to maintain the project as safe placeto live for all residents. The tenant should be responsible for all actionsby guests or members of the family. The tenant should have to face theconsequences of unruly behavior by family members and guests without necessityfor the PHA to prove active permission by the tenant. The comment statesthat under the proposed language, the resident will be able to ``passivelycondone'' third party acts which distrupt the community, and the PHA hasto show that the tenant actively allowed the guest to engage in prohibitedactivity.The final rule contains a single uniform formulation of the tenant's contractualresponsibility for third party acts. The tenant and other members of thehousehold must ``prevent'' disturbance, damage or illegal acts by ``guests,visitors, or other persons under control of Household members'' (andSection;966.10(h)(2) (i), (ii) and (iii)). The tenant has a positive duty to ``prevent''the prohibited activities by third parties. The tenant does not escaperesponsibility if the tenant and household passively condone prohibitedacts. Instead, the tenant and household must do what is necessary to ``prevent''the prohibited acts.The tenant's duty applies to actions by guests, visitors or other personsunder control of household members. HUD does not accept the view that thetenant should be responsible for any third party act that occurs in thefamily unit. The tenant should only be responsible for acts by guests orvisitors (i.e., persons who enter the unit with the consent of the household),or by other persons under control of the household. The tenant is not responsiblefor acts by persons who enter the unit without consent, and who are notunder control of household members. Liability for acts of guests or visitors,and for other persons under family control, is a stimulus to encouragethe tenant and other family members to be more careful in admitting guests,and induce the family to exercise control over other third parties in theunit. Conversely, liability for acts by third parties whom the family isunable to control may produce a sense of hopelessness and frustration.Third parties may break into the unit. The tenant should not be held answerableunder the lease for crimes committed against the family.D. GuestsThe rule provides (andSection; 966.10(g)(3)) that:<ITAG tagnum="21">members of the Household may receive guests or visitors in the dwellingunit. However, such use of the dwelling unit by the Household must be reasonable.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This language is substantially a restatement of the old rule provisionthat tenant's right to use and occupancy includes ``reasonable accommodation''of guests or visitors.Comment states that a requirement to register guests with the PHA shouldbe prohibited as an invasion of tenant privacy. The PHA has no right tointerfere if a person in the unit is a guest rather than an unregisteredtenant. Other comment states that guest rules should be left to discretionof the PHA. The PHA should have authority to require registration of guests.Registration is not a hardship for the tenant or the family. Registrationof guests helps the PHA deal with the problem of unauthorized occupancy.When the guest registers, the PHA can inform guests about PHA rules andregulations for visitors.The final rule does not prohibit PHAs from requiring registration of guestsor visitors. The rule does not contain any explicit provision concerningPHA registration requirements.HUD believes that the regulatory lease requirement to use the unit forresidence by the household (see andSection;andSection; 966.10(b)(1), 966.10(g)(1)and 966.10(h)(1)(1)), and the provision for ``reasonable'' use for guestsor visitors of the household (andSection; 966.10(g)(3)), sufficiently coverthe Federal interest that the unit be used only for residence by a lowerincome family, in accordance with the purpose of the statute.More detailed regulation of the presence of family guests is most appropriatelyleft to the judgment of the PHA, which may utilize lease provisions orhouse rules which further regulate the presence of guests or visitors ina public housing unit.E. FraudIn the lease, the tenant agrees that the tenant and other members of thehousehold ``shall not commit any fraud in connection with any Federal housingassistance program'' (andSection; 966.10(h)(2)(v)). This provision, whichis contained in the proposed and the final rule, concerns future fraudby unit occupants. Violation of tenant's promise is a violation of thelease, and is ground for termination of tenancy.The final rule adds a new separate lease provision to cover past fraudby unit occupants. The final rule is broadened to explicitly cover fraudcommitted by family members before execution of the public housing lease,or before the PHA approves occupancy by a new family member. Absent thischange in the rule, there might be question whether the PHA could terminatethe tenancy for past family fraud in the Federal housing assistance programs.The final rule provides (andSection; 966.10(h)(3)(i)) that the lease mustinclude a certification by the tenant that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Tenant and other members of the Household have not committed anyfraud in connection with any Federal housing assistance program, unlessany such fraud was fully disclosed to the PHA before execution of the lease,or before PHA approval for occupancy of the unit by the Household member.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The PHA may find out about past fraud after lease execution, or afterthe PHA approves occupancy by a new family member. For example, the PHAmay learn that the tenant deliberately concealed family income in orderto gain admission to the PHA's program. To prevent and punish program fraud,the PHA must have a contractual basis to terminate tenancy when fraud isrevealed.The requirement for the tenant to certify to the absence of past fraudby household members permits the PHA to terminate tenancy if the certificationis false. The certification requirement is also designed to give tenantsome incentive for full advance disclosure to the PHA. If the tenant fullydiscloses past fraud before execution of the lease, the existence of suchpast fraud is not a breach of tenant's certification under the lease. Whentenant makes advance disclosure of fraud, the PHA can make an informedcase-by-case judgment of the appropriate action (for example, by requiringthe tenant to enter into an agreement to repay section 8 assistance paidas a result of tenant fraud).The lease provisions governing past or prospective fraud by the unit occupants(andSection; 966.10(h)(2)(v) and 966.10(h)(3)(i)) only deal with fraud committedin connection with a ``Federal housing assistance program'', such as section8 or public housing. The requirements do not concern fraud unrelated toa Federal housing assistance program. However, the prohibition of housingfraud is not limited to fraud related to the public housing program, oracts to defraud the particular PHA which enters the lease. For example,the lease provisions would cover a fraudulent representation of familyincome in order to secure admission to the section 8 certificate programof the same PHA or another PHA. The provisions reflect the Federal interest,and HUD's particular role, in preventing and pursuing fraud in any Federalhousing assistance program. Fraud wastes Federal housing subsidy dollars,and denies scarce housing assistance for eligible families.The provision covers fraud by any member of the household_the whole groupof persons living in the unit with approval of the PHA. The commissionof fraud by any member of the family violates the lease, and is groundfor termination of tenancy.The final rule adds an explicit definition of the term ``fraud'' as usedin the lease (andSection; 966.2). As used in this rule, the term ``fraud''includes ``fraud as defined under any Federal or State civil or criminalstatute''. In addition, ``fraud'' for purpose of this rule is defined toinclude any other ``deliberate misrepresentation to the PHA by the Tenantor other members of the Household''.The regulatory definition of fraud thus embraces the full spectrum of behaviorwhich is treated as fraud under State or Federal law, and whether for civilor criminal purposes. The rule expresses a strong objective of strengtheningthe hand of the PHA in dealing with behavior defined as fraudulent underFederal law, or under State law in the State where the project is located.The PHA has the assurance that fraudulent actions proscribed by civil orcriminal law are grounds for action by the PHA against the tenant underthe lease. The PHA has therefore the strongest possible contractual basisto deter family fraud, and to take appropriate action if fraud is revealed.The rule provisions are intended to minimize diversion of Federal housingsubsidy resources because of fraudulent misrepresentation.Comment recommends that the rule prohibit fraud ``or misrepresentation''in connection with the programs. As indicated above, the regulatory definitionof fraud in the final rule includes intentional deception by ``misrepresentation''to the PHA. Misrepresentation is the crux of the concept of fraud. Thedefinition will broadly cover deliberate factual misrepresentation by familymembers, even if the type of misrepresentation is not otherwise calledor treated as ``fraud'' under Federal or State law.Public comment supports the prohibition of fraud in connection with Federalhousing assistance programs.F. Use of Dwelling<ITAG tagnum="81">1. For Members of Household</ITAG>The names of the tenant and of the other persons who will live in the dwellingunit are stated in the lease (andSection; 966.10(b)(1)). The only individualswho may live in the unit are the persons who are specifically approvedby the PHA for residence in the unit (see andSection; 966.10(h)(1)(i)(A)).The final rule contains a new definition of the term ``Household'' (andSection;966.2). The ``Household'' consists of the tenant and other persons wholive in the dwelling unit with written approval of the PHA. In the proposedrule, a similar notion was conveyed in a definition of the term ``family''.However, as generally used in public housing regulations and practice,the term ``family'' denotes the individual or group of individuals whoare eligible for public housing or section 8 assistance under the 1937Act (see U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 3, 42 U.S.C. 1437a; 24 CFR Part912). In two cases (foster children and live-in care attendants), occupantsof a public housing unit may include an individual who is not a memberof an eligible statutory ``family''. To avoid confusion, it is thereforehelpful to use the separate term ``Household'' to denote the whole bodyof authorized unit occupants, including any persons who are not membersof the statutory family.The lease must provide that the Tenant has the right ``to exclusive useof the dwelling unit for residence by the Household (andSection; 966.10(g)(1)).The lease may also provide that with written approval of the PHA, use ofthe unit may include care of foster children and live-in care of a memberof the family (andSection; 966.10(g)(2)).The requirement for PHA approval of all unit occupants serves a two-foldpurpose: Enforcement of statutory requirements related to unit occupancy,and the PHA management interest in controlling occupancy of the unit.In public housing, the unit must be occupied by a ``family''. In applyingthis statutory requirement, the PHA has broad authority to determine whethera group of individuals constitutes a statutory ``family'' which is eligiblefor assistance in a public housing unit. To perform this function, thePHA must control both the initial occupancy of the unit, and the additionof new family members. In addition, the amount of a tenant's rent is determinedby a statutory formula, and is based on the amount of family income. Toenforce the statutory procedures for computation of the rent, the PHA needsto know when new members are added to the family, so that new member incomeis counted in the computation of family rent.The PHA has a strong management interest in controlling occupancy of theunit. The PHA has the right to decide who is admitted to the housing, toassure that the sequence of admission is fair and consistent, to limitdensity of occupancy in the unit and project, and to assure that unit occupancyaccords with PHA tenant selection criteria (andSection; 960.204). The PHAinterest in maintaining control over unit occupancy applies to changesin composition of the family unit, just as to initial admission of thefamily. For example, the PHA has a continuing interest in preventing occupancyby persons with a history of criminal activity involving crimes of physicalviolence (cf., andSection; 960.205(b)(3)).Comment advises that the PHA authority to limit admission of new familymembers should be limited. The comment suggests that a tenant should notalways be required to secure PHA approval for unit occupancy by an additionalperson. Where PHA approval is required, the rule should provide that PHAconsent may not be unreasonably withheld. In particular, the comment statesthat the rule should provide that the consent for occupancy by a fosterchild or live-in care of a family member may not be unreasonably withheld.The recommendations in this comment are not adopted. The PHA's authorityto decide who may occupy a public housing unit should not be weakened.For some PHAs, illegal occupancy of public housing units is a massive problem.Failure to control unit occupancy produces a decay in the conditions ofproject life, including the growth of narcotics use and other criminalactivity. The requirement for a tenant to seek PHA approval of each new unit occupantis reasonable. Consideration of tenant requests is properly addressed tothe management discretion of the PHA. All PHA action is subject to thenormal judicial standards for review of official action under State law,such as a prohibition of action which is arbitrary or capricious. HUD hasno reason to impose a special contractual standard governing a PHA decisionto deny approval of a new unit occupant. A provision that approval maynot be ``unreasonably withheld'' may be construed restrictively, in a waythat prevents the PHA from making a legitimate and well-founded determinationto refuse approval of a new unit occupant. It should be noted that the rule does not state that the tenant must alwaysobtain PHA approval before the new occupant moves into the unit. In somecases, advance approval is not practicable or possible. A family membermay turn up suddenly, in need of immediate shelter. The PHA may need afew days to process a request for approval of the new unit occupant. Thusthe PHA may establish rules concerning the procedures and timetable forsecuring PHA approval for occupancy by a new family member. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Use As Household Residence </ITAG>The proposed rule provided that the family must use the dwelling unit asthe family's ``principal'' place of residence. Comment recommends thatthe rule should obligate the tenant to use the public housing dwellingunit as the family's ``only'' place of residence. The comment remarks thatHUD should not subsidize a family or individual with another residence,or a vacation home. The change is made as recommended. The revised rule provides (andSection;966.10(h)(1)(i)) that the tenant:shall use the dwelling unit (A) solely for residence by the Household,and (B) as the Tenant's only place of residence. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Incidental Business Use </ITAG>The purpose of public housing is to provide housing for poor families.However, the Department has long asserted that some incidental use of apublic dwelling unit for profit-making purposes may be consistent withthe primary use of the unit as a family residence in accordance with thestatute. For example, the family may earn money by babysitting, care ofa foster child, or envelope-stuffing. Family income from profit-makingactivities in the unit can be an important source of self-support by thefamily. The final rule adds a new provision to clarify that the requirement touse the unit exclusively for residence by the family does not mean thatthe family members are always barred from any gainful activity in the dwellingunit (andSection; 966.10(g)(1)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The lease may provide that with written approval of the PHA, membersof the Household may engage in legal profit-making activities incidentalto primary use of the dwelling unit for residence by the Household.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The rule also provides (andSection; 966.10(h)(1)(i)) that although thedwelling unit may only be used for residence by members of the household:<ITAG tagnum="21">if approved by the PHA under the lease, members of the Household mayengage in incidental profit-making activities [in the dwelling unit].</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The new provisions codify the authority for incidental profit-makingactivities in the dwelling unit.The regulation does not, however, authorize the conversion of a publichousing dwelling unit to a business use, e.g., by changing an apartmentto a store or office. The business activity must not prevent the familyfrom living in the unit. The unit must remain as the actual residence ofthe family members, and the profit making activity must be ``incidental''to the primary residential use. HUD recognizes that in marginal cases thedetermination of what kinds of activities can be permitted, and to whatextent, may be difficult, and will require case-by-case determination.In the first instance, it is the responsibility of the PHA to make thisdetermination. Under the rule, the PHA is not required to permit gainful activity in thedwelling unit by members of the assisted family. The lease ``may provide''for such incidental activity if the PHA chooses to incorporate provisionfor such activity in the lease. If the PHA elects to allow such activity,the household members may only engage in such activity ``with written approvalof the PHA''. The requirement for PHA approval is intended to assure thatthe PHA retains necessary contractual control over activities which departfrom the basic residential use of the unit, which may affect living conditionsfor other building residents (e.g., because of noise or traffic), and whichmay affect physical condition and maintenance of the dwelling unit. Finally it is important to note that the lease may only authorize use ofthe unit for ``legal'' profit making activities by household members, andthat under the lease members of the household may not engage in criminalactivity in the unit, and must prevent criminal activity by guests or visitors(andSection; 966.10(h)(2)(iii)). G. Rent and Charges <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Determination of Rent </ITAG><T3>a. Amount of Rent.</T3> The required lease provisions state that therent payable by the tenant is an amount determined by the PHA in accordancewith HUD regulations and other requirements, and in accordance with PHApolicy (andSection; 966.10(c)(1)). The rule also adds definitions of ``TenantRent'' and ``Total Tenant Payment'' (andSection; 966.2). These terms aredefined to conform with the definitions and rent determination procedureunder the rule on rent calculation procedures in the public housing program(24 CFR Part 913). PHA rent determinations are largely controlled by HUD procedures whichimplement the statutory rental formula (see 24 CFR Part 913). Statutoryand regulatory rent requirements may change from time to time. The termsof the lease between the tenant and the PHA permit necessary adjustmentsin the amount of tenant rent because of statutory and regulatory changes.The final rule specifies that the changes must be implemented in accordancewith PHA policy, rather than as ad hoc determinations for each tenant.<T3>b. Notice of Rent.</T3> The rule provides that any change in the amountof the tenant rent must be stated in a written notice by the PHA to thetenant (andSection; 966.10(c)(2)). The notice must state the new amount ofrent, and the effective date of the change. The notice must also statethat the tenant may ask for an explanation of how the rent is computedby the PHA. If the tenant asks for an explanation, the PHA must answerthe request in a reasonable time.The PHA must give a tenant the opportunity for an administrative grievancehearing on a proposed ``adverse action''. The PHA's proposed decision determiningthe amount of the tenant rent is a proposed ``adverse action'' (andSection;966.31(a)(2)(iii)(A)). The tenant may ask the PHA for an explanation ofthe proposed decision (andSection; 966.10(c)(2)). If the tenant does notagree that the PHA rent determination complies with HUD regulations, thetenant may ask the PHA to change the rent. If the PHA denies the tenant'srequest to change the proposed determination of tenant rent, the PHA mustgive the tenant notice of the reasons for the proposed decision, and ofthe opportunity for an informal hearing (andSection;andSection; 966.31(b)(1)and 966.31(b)(2)(iii)).Comment states that the PHA notice of the new rent amount should set outhow the rent was calculated, so that the tenant can detect a miscalculation.By giving the calculation, the PHA may reduce the number of explanationsneeded.The suggestion is not adopted. Some PHAs may find it helpful to includea statement of the rent calculation with the notice of the new rent amount.This procedure may minimize the number of cases in which tenants need furtherexplanation, and may tend to minimize disputes and the need for grievancehearings over the PHA rent computation. However, other PHAs may find thatother techniques are more efficient or informative to let tenants knowhow the rent is computed, and to avoid unnecessary disputes over the rent.The PHA may prefer to give the tenant information and explanations on howthe rent is computed when the tenant submits the reexamination information;for example, in an interview with the tenant at the time of reexamination.The PHA may conclude that the bare statement of the rent calculation isnot helpful, or is more likely to lead to confusion than understanding.HUD does not have a sufficient basis to impose on all PHAs a requirementfor routine inclusion of the rent calculation procedure in the PHA rentnotice.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Interim Reexamination</ITAG><T3>a. Rent increase.</T3> Incomes of all tenants must be reexamined atleast annually (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 3(a), 42 U.S.C. 1437a(a);24 CFR 960.209(a)). Comment suggests that the Department should prohibitupward revisions of rent as a result of an interim reexamination (i.e.,an examination of family income between regular annual examinations).The Department has not accepted this suggestion. Most reexaminations areconducted on an annual basis, but there is no reason to prohibit the PHAfrom adjusting rent on the basis of more current information. The statuteonly requires that reexaminations are conducted ``at least'' annually,but does not preclude reexamination at shorter intervals, or adjustmentsof tenant rent to reflect an earlier reexamination.The Preamble to the rule governing rent and income reexaminations in thepublic housing program states that:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * some PHAs need the flexibility to conduct reexaminations morefrequently than annually under procedures now provided in HUD handbooks.For example, earlier recertifications are appropriate if the PHA has performeda tenant-requested reexamination for a change in circumstances that isfound to have been temporary. (24 CFR Part 913, 49 FR 21476, 21480-81,May 21, 1984.)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">PHA comment on the instant rulemaking agrees that PHAs need flexibilityto conduct examinations of family income more often than annually.<T3>b. Rent Decrease.</T3> Comment states that there should be a reexaminationand consequent reduction of rent when there is a decrease of family income,or a change in other factors which would result in a reduction of rent(such as unanticipated medical expense for the elderly) between annualreexaminations. PHA refusal to perform an interim examination for a familywith a substantial income loss causes eviction and suffering. PHAs shouldbe encouraged to reduce rents as soon as feasible. Comment recommends thatif a tenant reports an income decrease, or other facts which would justifya downward adjustment of the rent, the rent should be adjusted for themonth after such report.Comment argues that the lease should state the conditions when the PHAmust perform an interim reexamination for decreases in family income. Section960.209(b) provides that if the PHA receives information on changes infamily income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexamination,the PHA must ``make any adjustments determined to be appropriate''. Commentstates that since rent is a basic element of the lease, the tenant shouldbe told that the tenant is entitled to an interim reexamination.In this rulemaking, HUD has not made, and did not propose, any substantivechange in HUD requirements for reexamination of family income or determinationof tenant rent. Those requirements are outside the framework and functionof the lease and grievance rule, and are not the subject of this rulemaking.The lease requirements in the present rule are only intended to providethe contractual framework for enforcement of HUD rent determination procedures,including requirements regarding reexamination of family income.HUD will not add new requirements for the PHA to adjust rent payments becauseof changes in family circumstances between annual reexaminations, and willnot require that the lease state the basis for conducting an interim reexaminationof family income. Under the present governing regulation (andSection; 960.209(b))the PHA must make adjustments ``determined to be appropriate'' becauseof a change in family income or other circumstances between regular annualreexaminations. The PHA has the authority and responsibility to determinewhat adjustments are ``appropriate'' in different circumstances. The regulationdoes not require an automatic adjustment of rent for changes in familycircumstances. The PHA is expected to devise policies for appropriate response,by interim reexamination and adjustment of rent, to unanticipated changesof income and family composition. The statute does not require that thePHA conduct an interim reexamination. The PHA is only required to conducta reexamination ``at least annually'' (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section3(a), 42 U.S.C. 1437a(a)).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Items Included In Rent</ITAG>The amount of rent paid by a public housing tenant is set by Federal law(U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 3(a), 42 U.S.C. 1437a(a)). For mosttenants, the rent is 30 per cent of adjusted income. The PHA may not increasethe rent over the statutory formula amount, but may charge the tenant foritems in addition to rent.Rent includes service and maintenance needed to keep the housing in decent,safe and sanitary condition. Under HUD administrative implementation ofthe statutory rent limitation, rent also includes a reasonable allowancefor consumption of utilities. Under the required lease provisions, thelease must state the utilities, and the services, maintenance, equipmentand appliances, which are included in the rent, and are furnished by thePHA without additional charge to the tenant (andSection;andSection; 966.10(c)(3)and 966.10(d)(1)).Utilities may be paid directly by the tenant to the utility supplier ormay be paid by the PHA. If the tenant pays for the utility, an allowancefor the tenant utility cost is deducted from the rent which must be paidto the PHA (called ``tenant rent'', definition at andSection; 966.2). Ifthe utility is paid by the PHA, an allowance for reasonable consumptionof the utility is included in the rent. If consumption of PHA-paid utilitiesis measured by an individual checkmeter, the PHA may bill the tenant forconsumption in excess of the allowance (andSection; 966.10(d)(3)(ii)).  Comment recommends requiring a PHA to furnish utilities. This recommendationis not adopted. The factors which determine the mix of utility suppliesfor the unit (what utilities, and whether the utilities are paid by thetenant or the PHA), and the technical procedures for determination of PHA-wideutility allowances in accordance with HUD requirements, are determinedoutside of the lease. However, the lease should state what utilities arepaid by the PHA, and what utilities are paid for by the tenant. In addition,the tenant needs to know the amount of any allowance for tenant-paid orPHA-paid utilities. The lease states the mix of tenant and PHA paid utilitiesfor the unit, and the lease also requires notice of applicable allowancesfor PHA-paid or tenant-paid utilities (andSection; 966.10(d)(5)). In thefinal rule, treatment of utility costs and rent is expanded and clarified(and is consolidated in andSection; 966.10(d)).  The rule provides that the lease must state what utilities are includedin the tenant rent, and are supplied without additional charge to the tenant(called ``PHA-furnished utilities'') (andSection; 966.10(d)(1)). The finalrule also adds a new parallel provision governing treatment of utilitiespaid by the tenant. The rule provides that the lease must state what utilitiesare not included in the tenant rent, and must be purchased by the tenantfrom the utility suppliers (called ``Tenant-purchased utilities'') (andSection;966.10(d)(2)).  The final rule includes parallel provisions that allowances for PHA-furnishedutilities (andSection; 966.10(d)(3)(i)) and for tenant-purchased utilities(andSection; 966.10(d)(4)(i)) must be determined in accordance with HUD regulationsand requirements. The rule also includes a provision (carried forward withoutchange from the old rule) that surcharges for excess consumption of PHA-furnishedutilities are only allowed if the charges are determined by an individualcheckmeter for the unit (andSection; 966.10(d)(3)(ii)).  The final rule includes a new provision for notice and change of utilityallowances under the lease (andSection; 966.10(d)(5)). The PHA must givenotice to the tenant of any applicable allowance for PHA-furnished or tenant-purchasedutilities. The PHA may change the allowance at any time during the termof the lease, and must give the tenant written notice of the revised allowance.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. PHA Charges In Addition to Rent  </ITAG><T3>a. Authority for charges. </T3>The final rule provides (andSection; 966.10(e)(1)):<ITAG tagnum="21">(i) The lease shall state what types of charges the Tenant is requiredto pay the PHA in addition to Tenant Rent. The lease shall state how thecharges will be determined by the PHA (for example, by a schedule of surchargesfor excess consumption of utilities, or by a schedule of repair charges).The PHA's schedules or other procedures for determining Tenant chargesshall be made available for inspection and copying by the Tenant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) The PHA shall give the Tenant written notice of any charge inaddition to rent, and of when the charge is due * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) The lease may require the Tenant to pay reasonable charges,as determined by the PHA, for damage other than normal wear or tear, causedby Household members, or by guests, visitors, or other persons under controlof Household members.</ITAG>These provisions are intended to provide a foundation for assessment ofPHA charges <T3>in addition to rent. </T3>Comment states that PHA charges in excessof the statutory public housing rent are illegal if the charges are (1)for necessary services, or (2) are for non-essential facilities or services,but are mandatory. Comment asks who is responsible for assuring that apublic housing tenant is not paying more than the statutory rent.  Charges for excess utility consumption, or for damages to the unit, arethe most important types of non-rent charges. PHA surcharges for excessconsumption of utilities are not included in the rent, nor are chargesfor damages caused by the family or its guests. In addition, the PHA maylevy other types of charges, if the charges are not in the nature of rent.In recent cases, courts have held that a tenant may be required to payfor mandatory services not included in the rent. (These cases upheld mandatorymeal charges in the section 8 program under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937,where tenants are subject to the same statutory rent limit as in publichousing.) The present rule does not amend or in any way affect the operationof the rule on computation of public housing rent (24 CFR Part 913). Further,the rule does not define what types of charges are not included in rent,and may therefore be imposed outside of the statutory limit on public housingrent.  In the first instance, it is the responsibility of the PHA to determinewhat must be included in the rent, and what charges may be levied by thePHA in addition to tenant rent. If the tenant does not agree with the PHAdecision to levy a charge in addition to rent, the tenant may ask for ahearing under the PHA grievance procedure. A challenge to the validityof the PHA charge may also be raised as a defense by tenant if the PHAbrings a court action to evict the family for non-payment of the charge. A PHA recommends deletion of provision that PHA charges are ``in additionto rent'', so that the additional charges may be collected as rent in asummary nonpayment proceeding. This recommendation is not accepted. Asa matter of Federal law, PHA additional charges are not part of the rentsubject to the Federal statutory rent limitation. The fact that the specialcharges do not constitute rent for this Federal purpose is the legal basiswhich permits imposition of the charges.  This rule does not seek to determine the appropriate State court or proceedingfor collection of PHA charges. The procedures and proper forum for collectionof rent or charges in State court are determined by State law. State lawmay permit the collection of rent and charges in a single proceeding orin separate proceedings. A State court will determine as a matter of Statelaw whether the court has jurisdiction to adjudicate issues concerningadditional non-rent charges in a proceeding to evict for non-payment of``rent'', and whether additional charges are included in ``rent'' for thepurpose of the State statutes or rules governing jurisdiction of the court.This jurisdictional question is wholly distinct from the Federal questionof what constitutes rent for purpose of applying the Federal statutorylimit on rent payable by a public housing tenant.  Some comment supports promulgation of HUD's proposed provision to providefor charges in addition to rent. Comment recommends various technical revisionsof the proposed language.  <T3>b. Charge for Damages. </T3>The proposed rule stated that a tenant``may'' be required to pay PHA charges for damages to the unit. Commentstates that the rule should say that the tenant ``shall'' be required topay the PHA charges, presumably to clarify that payment of the chargesis mandatory. The final rule provides that the lease must state what chargesthe tenant ``is required'' to pay in addition to the tenant rent (andSection;966.10(e)(1)(i)). Payment of the charges is mandatory. The PHA is responsiblefor drafting appropriate lease language under the rule, and may craft leaselanguage which will unambiguously express the duty of the tenant to paycharges in addition to rent. The proposed rule stated that the tenant may be required to pay chargesfor ``maintenance'' beyond normal wear and tear. Comment states that thePHA should only charge the tenant for ``damage'' beyond normal wear andtear. ``Maintenance'' is necessary to counteract normal wear and tear.The authority to charge for ``maintenance'' opens doors to inappropriateand punitive charges.HUD notes that the proposed language was not intended to cover chargesfor maintenance needed to correct the effects of time and ordinary use,but to allow the PHA to collect charges for harm to the unit that resultsfrom negligent or abusive use. As suggested by the comments, this ideais more accurately expressed by referring to charges for ``damage'' tothe unit. The final rule provides that the tenant must pay reasonable charges,as determined by the PHA, for ``damage other than normal wear and tear''(andSection; 966.10(e)(1)(iii)).Comment states that the tenant should only be responsible for damage causedby persons under the family's control. A tentant should not be responsiblefor damage caused by vandals or burglars. The final rule states that thelease may provide that the tenant must pay charges for damages ``causedby Household members, or by guests, visitors, or other persons under controlof Household members'' (andSection; 966.10(e)(1)(iii)).PHA comment criticizes a requirement that the damages charged to the tenantmust be ``caused'' by the family or its guests. The comment asserts thatthe rule would place on the PHA the burden of showing who caused the damage.All unit damage beyond normal wear and tear (such as torn screens, brokenwindows, damaged doors or graffiti) should be charged to the tenant. Thecomment states that the PHA is not able to establish who caused the damage,or whether the person is a family guest. The determination whether thetenant is required to pay for damage should not be based on who causedthe damage. However, charges for damages in common areas should be basedon evidence of who caused the damage.Providing who caused damage is a hard problem, especially for damage insidethe unit. After the fact, the PHA can show the damage, but usually hasno direct evidence who caused the damage. The family lives in the unit,and is in a better position to know what happened. However, damage in theunit is not always caused by the family or its guests. Damage may be causedby a storm, by a thief, or by a damage source outside the unit (such asa burst pipe in an upstairs unit). Damage inside the unit may sometimesoccur because the PHA has not performed some contractual obligation, forexample, water damage because the PHA fails to fix the plumbing; fire damagebecause the PHA does not install a fire detector required by State law.Although there are difficult problems of proof, the allocation of responsibilityto pay for damage should depend on who caused the damage. The tenant shouldpay for damage caused by the family. PHA charges for family-caused damages,or the possibility of eviction because of such damages, are an inducementto correct family behavior. On the other hand, if damage is not causedby the family, the family may not have the power to avoid the damage. Chargesagainst the tenant for damages that are not caused by the family are morelikely to create a sense of helplessness and resentment, than to producea salutary correction of family behavior.Analysis of this problem should distinguish between the tenant's ultimateresponsibliity for family-caused damage, and the technique for provingwho caused the damage (in the PHA's administrative procedures leading toinitial determination of the charge, in the PHA grievance procedure, orin court). The damage provision in this rule only purports to determinethe ultimate allocation of responsibility for damage to the unit. The leasemay require the tenant to pay charges for damages caused by the family.However, the rule does not state what property has the burden of provingwho caused damage to the unit, and does not state how the fact of causationis to be proved.In the State landlord tenant-court, procedures to prove causation are governedby State law. In proving causation, proof that there is damage to the unitand that the family has possession of the unit may constitute adequatecircumstantial evidence to support a finding that the damage was causedby the family. The requirements for proving causation by family membersmay be affected by provisions of the lease form drafted by the PHA. Ifpermitted by State law, the lease could provide that the tenant is responsiblefor interior damage beyond normal wear and tear unless the tenant can provethat the damage was caused by persons not on the premises with consentof the family, or was caused by some other factor not attributable to thetenant. The PHA grievance procedure may contain provisions which regulatethe burden of proof in the administrative hearing, or the procedures forproving in the hearing who caused the damage to the unit.<T3>c. Notice of Charges; When Charges Are Due. </T3>The new rule provides(andSection; 966.10(e)(1)(ii)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The PHA shall give the Tenant written notice of the amount of anycharge in addition to Tenant Rent, and of when the charge is due.</ITAG>The old rule provided that a charge for tenant damage or for excess consumptionof PHA-furnished utilities is not due until the second month after thecharge is incurred. For example, a charge posted on January 1 could notbe collected until March. In the 1986 proposed rule, HUD proposed to eliminatethis restriction on when charges in addition to rent may be collected,and to require instead that the PHA must give ``reasonable notice'' ofsuch charges.PHA comment approves this proposed change. The PHA should not have to waitto the second month after a cost is incurred. The old rule restrictioncauses delay in the process for eviction of a tenant. It the charges arenot paid when due (at the beginning of the second month after the monthwhen the charge is incurred), the PHA must then give another 30 days noticeof termination of the lease. The old restriction is also confusing fortenants. Removal of the restriction gives the PHA increased flexibilityfor faster collection of charges in addition to rent. PHA comment suggeststhat charges should be due at the first of the month after work is done. Legal aid comment objects to changing the old restriction. If allowed flexibility,the PHA may set short periods for notice and payment of charges, and enforcethe requirements unevenly. The question of whether the PHA has given ``reasonable''notice will be subject to litigation. Comment states that under the presentrule may PHAs bill quarterly for utility surcharges. This practice ensureseviction of the most vulnerable, who don't have time to raise the money. PHA comment objects to the proposed requirement for PHA to give noticeof any charges when due. The PHA statement of charges is included in themonthly rent statement. The PHA should not be required to give advancenotice of the charge prior to the monthly billing.  The new rule does not require any fixed delay in collection of chargeslevied by the PHA. The new provision provides simply that the PHA mustgive the tenant written notice of the amount of the charge, and when thecharge is due. To pay the charge, or to request a grievance on the charge,the tenant has to know that the PHA has levied a charge, how much and whendue. The rule does not state that the notice must be ``reasonable''. However,the rule allows the PHA to assess ``reasonable fees'' for late paymentof rent or charges determined by the PHA (andSection; 966.10(e)(2)). The PHA should have clear administrative discretion to decide when chargesare payable by the tenant under the lease. Different procedures may beappropriate for different types of charges, or because of different familycircumstances. In some cases, the PHA may wish to bill for charges as soonas the amount can be determined, for example, to collect damage for destructivebehavior by the family. In other cases, the PHA may wish to spread paymentover a period of time, to facilitate payment by the tenant, for example,surcharges for excess consuption of PHA-furnished utilities. Examinationof the public comments suggests that the proposed provision for ``reasonable''notice of charges in addition to rent is likely to be a source of confusionand unnecessary litigation, and may be applied in a way that undesirablylimits the ability of the PHA to develop a scheme for assessment of chargesother than rent.  <T3>d. Legal Fees and Charges.</T3> The rule provides (andSection; 966.11(h))that the lease may not include:<ITAG tagnum="21">[an] agreement by the Tenant to pay lawyer's fees or other legal costseven if the Tenant wins in a court proceeding by the PHA against the Tenant.However, the Tenant may be obligated to pay such costs in the Tenant loses.</ITAG>Legal aid comment asserts that the tenant should never be required to payPHA attorney fees or court costs. Allowing the PHA to collect legal feesif the tenant loses deters the tenant from protecting tenant rights inState court. The assessment of cost of the tenant is more troublesome ifthe PHA excludes eviction from the PHA grievance process, so that the tenantcan only contest eviction through the court.  PHA comment states that the tenant should pay legal fees when the tenantloses the court case. Tenant payment of legal fees and charges is a vitalingredient in the fiscal health of the PHA, and helps to promote tenantresponsibility. Tenants get free help from legal aid, but the PHA is forcedto retain counsel. Comment states that the tenant should be required topay legal costs regardless of outcome, even if the tenant wins.  The rule retains the prohibition of lease provisions which obligate thetenant to pay legal costs even if the tenant wins in a court proceedingby the PHA against the tenant. Thus, for example, the PHA-drafted leasemay not provide that the tenant must pay PHA legal costs of an evictionaction if the State court finds that the PHA lacks grounds for eviction.The prohibition is consonant with similar prohibitions for other HUD rentalsubsidy programs.  The rule provides that the tenant may be obligated to pay legal costs ifthe tenant loses. The tenant should not be insulated from the obligationto pay legal costs if the tenant loses in the court proceeding. The allocationof legal costs should be determined by local law and practice. Paymentby the losing party is not unreasonable, and compensates the PHA for thefiscal and administrative burden of conducting the litigation. The factthat the tenant may have to pay legal costs if the tenant loses discouragesthe tenant from pursuing an unsound or frivolous position. As suggestedby PHA comment, the obligation to pay costs encourages tenant responsibility. The rule does not prohibit imposition of legal costs to the tenant in theabsence of litigation, or if litigation does not proceed to judgment, orthe use of a lease provision which imposes such costs on the tenant.  PHA may be forced to take steps toward eviction (e.g., by serving a noticeto quit) as a technique of inducing tenant compliance with the lease, sothat the tenant will pay up the rent, or will stop unacceptable conduct.If the tenant complies, the eviction is not pursued. A PHA comment statesthat the PHA should be allowed to charge costs to tenant if the PHA stopsthe eviction action after the tenant pays the amount sued for. If the PHAcan only charge costs to the tenant if the tenant loses, the PHA is forcedto proceed to judgment, thus damaging the tenant's credit history. Thetenant should be able to acknowledge error, remedy the problem, pay costsand avoid the judgement.  It is fair to make the tenant pay PHA legal costs which are incurred becauseof the tenant's non-compliance with the lease. Equally important, the existenceof a penalty for delay (in the form of a requirement to pay the PHA legalcosts) will tend to promote compliance with the lease. Conversely, theabsence of a penalty tends to undermine the incentive for compliance withthe lease. The rule leaves the door open to PHA use of lease clauses whichrequire the tenant to pay PHA legal costs if a legal action does not proceedto judgment.  Comment states that if the tenant is required to pay legal fees if tenantloses, a losing PHA should also be required to pay legal fees. This suggestionis not adopted. The rule does not require payment of legal fees by eithertenant or PHA. The rule also does not require that there be symmetry inthe imposition of costs, such that the tenant is required to pay costsif costs are imposed on the PHA by State law or the lease, or that thePHA is required to pay costs if costs are imposed on the tenant. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Non-Payment</ITAG><T3>a. Remedy for Non-payment. </T3>A tenant may fail to pay rent or chargeson time. The delinquency may be for the whole payment due, or only a portionof the payment. The delinquency may occur on an isolated occasion, or maybe repeated month after month. There are two sanctions for non-payment.The PHA may evict the tenant, or the PHA may charge a late fee. Legal aidcomment aims to restrict the right of the PHA to impose sanctions for tenantnon-payment. Comment argues that HUD should narrow the authority of thePHA to terminate tenancy for non-payment of rent or charges, or to imposefees for late payment. PHA comment, on the other hand, welcomes provisionswhich strengthen the administrative authority of the PHA to devise andimpose prompt and effective sanctions for non-payment.The U.S. Housing Act of 1937 provides (section 6(c)(4)(B), 42 U.S.C. 1437(c)(4)(B))that a PHA must comply with procedures and requirements prescribed by HUDto:<ITAG tagnum="20">assure that sound management practices will be followed in the operationof the [public housing] project, including requirements pertaining to ** * the establishment of satisfactory procedures designed to assure theprompt payment and collection of rents and the prompt processing of evictionsin the case of non-payment.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In this rule, the lease provisions are designed to provide a contractualbasis for vigorous enforcement by the PHA of the tenant's responsibilityto pay rent and charges under the lease. With respect to non-payment ofrent, the lease provisions carry out the statutory directive to assurethat PHAs establish satisfactory management procedures for the prompt paymentof rents and processing of evictions (see House Committee Report 93-1114,pp. 23-25, June 17, 1974).The expectation of the tenant that the PHA is ready and able to imposeeffective penalties for non-payment is the necessary underpinning to inducethe tenant to pay on time. The lack of a penalty for late payment is likelyto promote a pattern of rent delinquency. The Department has noted that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Although the payment of rent is difficult for a poor family, the requirementfor payment of the statutory rent contribution could collapse unless enforcedby the possibility of effective sanctions. (49 FR at 12218, March 29, 1984.)</ITAG>Comment states that late payment should not be ground for eviction in assistedhousing. Other comment states that chronic inexcusable late payment shouldbe ground for eviction (but that the PHA should not be allowed to assessfees for non-payment).A public housing tenant does not pay market rent, or an economic rent whichcovers the costs to provide the housing. The tenant is required to payas rent a portion of income determined by statute (U.S. Housing Act of1937, section 3(a), 42 U.S.C. 1437a(a)), and HUD regulation (24 CFR Part913). The PHA must have the power to enforce the tenant's rent contribution,by assessment of fees for late payment, or by eviction of a tenant. Latepayment of rent may have serious consequences for the PHA, including PHAcosts to collect the delayed payment. The lack of an effective sanctionfor late payment will lead to habitual late payment by the tenants.To enforce the tenant's duty to pay rent, the PHA must be able to terminatethe tenancy for non-payment. The prospect of possible eviction is the mostdrastic and effective sanction for non-payment of rent or charges, andis the most powerful stimulus for the prompt payment of rent. The suggesteddistinction between non-payment and late payment is not a viable basisfor distinguishing cases which should or should not be grounds for terminationof tenancy. If a tenant may not be evicted for late payment, the tenantwill wait to the last possible moment to pay the rent.A tenant may be evicted for non-payment (including a single or repeatedlate payment) for any of the statutory grounds for termination of tenancy:for serious or repeated violation of the lease, or for other good cause.In the next section of this Preamble, we discuss when non-payment of rentor charges may be treated as a serious violation of the lease.<T3>b. Non-payment as Serious Violation of Lease. </T3>Under section 6(l)(4)of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(4)), the PHA may terminatethe tenancy for ``serious or repeated violation'' of the lease. The proposedrule would provide that ``non-payment of rent or charges under the lease(including any portion of such amounts)'' is a serious violation of thelease. Non-payment is therefore a ground for termination of tenancy, evenif the violation is not repeated.Legal aid comment states that non-payment of PHA charges should not betreated as a serious violation. Comment states that providing that anynon-payment of any rent or any charge is a ``serious'' lease violationleaves too much room for PHA discretion. Comment objects to allowing thePHA to evict when only a portion of rent or charges is due, or only a smallamount is due. PHA comment approves HUD's proposed treatment of terminationof tenancy for non-payment. On reconsideration, HUD has decided to revisethe provision that any non-payment of any amount of rent or PHA chargesis a ``serious'' lease violation.The concept of ``serious'' violation is significant because it determineswhether a single lease violation is ground for termination of tenancy underthe standard in the 1983 law. The PHA may terminate the tenancy eitherfor ``serious'' violation or for ``repeated'' violation of the lease. Anypattern of repeated violation may be ground for termination of tenancy.A single violation is ground for termination only if the violation is ``serious''.The PHA needs to determine whether a single non-payment of rent or chargesis a serious lease violation, and hence ground for termination of tenancy.This determination may properly be based on an array of factors relatingto impact of non-payment on PHA administration of the program. These factorsmay include the absolute amount of money due from the tenant, the portionof the amount due which is delinquent, PHA administrative and legal costsin collecting delinquent rent or charges, the effect of delinquency onPHA collections, how long the payment is overdue or other factors. In determiningseriousness of violation in an individual case, the question is not primarilywhether an isolated violation in the particular case will have a seriousimpact on the PHA program, but whether the type of violation involved wouldhave a serious impact if broadly replicated in the PHA program.The final rule provides (andSection; 966.21(b)(2)) that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The PHA may determine that non-payment of Tenant Rent or charges isa serious violation of the lease. In making this determination, the PHAmay consider factors relating to impact of such non-payment on PHA administrationof the program. These factors may include the amount owed, how much ofthe amount owed is overdue, costs of collection, effect of non-paymenton collection of rents and charges, how long the payment is overdue, orother factors. The PHA may establish a policy for determining what typeof non-payment will be treated as a serious violation of the lease.</ITAG>The initial determination of the seriousness of different types of leaseviolation rests with the PHA. The PHA has a continuing responsibility formanagement of the local public housing program. The PHA is in the bestposition to know how non-payment will affect PHA collections, and the PHA'soverall strategy for administration of the local program, and thereforewhether the non-payment should be treated as a ``serious'' violation ofthe lease. The rule specifies that in making this determination the PHAmay weigh a broad range of factors relating to management of the program.HUD expects that, in practice, most PHAs will develop a general patternfor handling non-payment cases, rather than handle the cases by an isolatedexamination of each individual instance of tenant non-payment. The PHA may elect to adopt a formal policy for determining when non-payment(a single instance) is a serious violation, and thus grounds for terminationof tenancy. The adoption of such a policy has several advantages. First,the process of adopting the policy is an occasion for systematic considerationof different types of non-payment, and the relation of non-payment to PHAmanagement policy. Second, the adoption of a formal policy will tend toresult in a more consistent treatment of non-payment cases, that is betterrelated to overall PHA management policies. The rule does not require that the PHA adopt a formal policy on when non-paymentis a serious violation. The PHA may choose to determine if the violationis a serious lease violation on an informal or ad hoc basis. The PHA may terminate tenancy if the tenant commits a ``serious or repeated''lease violation by failing to pay rent or charges when due. However, evenif there are grounds for termination, the PHA may decide that the tenantshould not be evicted. <T3>c. Excuse for Late Payment; Grace Period.</T3> Comment argues thatnon-payment should not be ground for termination of tenancy if the non-paymentis excusable, or results from circumstances beyond control of the tenant.Comment states that inability to pay rent on time may result from latereceipt of income, or from emergency or other special circumstances. Latepayment should not be automatic grounds for eviction. In public housing, the amount of rent is based on family income. Commentargues that rent should not be payable before the family has received theincome on which the rent is based. The family may not receive income onthe first of the month. Wages or welfare or other government benefits maybe paid late. Wages or welfare payments may be paid twice monthly (ratherthan on the first of the month), Comment asserts that rent should not bedue before some interval following actual receipt of income. Comment statesthat HUD should allow a ``reasonable'' time, should allow three days afteractual late receipt of regularly scheduled income, or should set a minimumFederal grace period. Public housing rent is calculated on an estimate of anticipated incomeover the period to the next scheduled reexamination, and is based on theincome information provided by the family. The rent determination essentially``averages out'' family income over the reexamination period. Actual incomein any particular month may be more or less than the average monthly incomeover the year, because of changes in family income or because of variationsin the time at which the income is received. The rent due to the PHA atthe beginning of each month is not based on the income actually receivedby the family during the month immediately preceding the rental payment,but on the average monthly income for the period covered by the reexamination.Under this system, it is the responsibility of the tenant to put asideenough money to cover the statutory rental payment when the payment isdue. This type of system permits practical administration of the statutoryrequirements for determination or rent based on family income. Family income may be comprised of income from various sources, receivedat varying intervals, at varying points of the month and with varying regularity.The time when income is actually received is affected by a host of particularcircumstances. Comment indicates that rent due each month should be basedon amounts actually received during the preceding month, or should be payablepiecemeal over the course of the month, as the family receives the segmentsof family income on which the rent is based (such as a biweekly paymentof welfare benefits). HUD believes that a system based on these principles would not be workable.Currently, a PHA is required to determine tenant rent ``at least annually'',as required by statute. Under the proposed change, the PHA would have toseparately determine rent payable for each individual month, or even atparticular points during the month. Moreover, the determination of howmuch is due would depend on facts concerning when the income was receivedduring the month. The PHA would be forced to use new procedures for monthlydetermination of the monthly rent, and to give opportunity for the tenantto show excuses for nonpayment. Verification of tenant excuses would beburdensome or impossible. Institution of the proposed changes would vastly increase difficultiesof the PHA in projecting and planning for tenant rental income. Receiptswould be subject to erratic variations depending on actual or alleged delaysin payment. Comment states that the rule should protect a tenant who cannot pay therent due to loss of income, or who needs funds to cover a financial emergency,such as desertion by the family breadwinner, delay or wrongful terminationof governmental benefits, death in the family, loss of employment. Thesecases may be divided into two categories: (1) Cases in which the tenantloses some income source originally included in the estimate of familyincome used to compute the rent, e.g., when a family member loses a job,or (2) cases in which the family needs to use family income for some urgentpurpose, e.g., emergency medical expenses. If there is a decrease in anticipated family income, the tenant may askfor an interim examination. Section 960.209(b) provides that if there isa change in income between regular reexaminations the PHA must ``make anyadjustments determined to be appropriate'' (see discussion at section III.G.2.bof this Preamble). The need to use rent money for some other urgent and meritorious purposecannot be accepted as an excuse for non-payment of rent. In the natureof the public housing program, the duty to pay rent is always imposed ona family of slender financial resources. Almost always, the family hasmany pressing financial needs. The statutory rent formula represents aCongressional determination that all families in public housing must paya rental contribution based on the amount of family income. There is nostatutory exception for a family which alleges a compelling need to usethe rental monies for some other purpose, however worthy. Beyond the fiscal benefits, universal enforcement of rent payment againstall assisted families is an element in the education of the families inthe personal and financial discipline needed to escape from poverty. Publichousing families must learn to plan and save for the monthly rent payment,and so must bear the consequences if they do not. In addition, tough anduniversal enforcement of the rent requirement is more likely to breed respectand care for the housing. Comment states that the grace period for payment of rent under the Federalrule should never be less than allowed under State law. Comment notes thatprotections beyond the Federal rule may be allowed to a tenant under Statelaw, such as the right, in a particular State, to redeem the tenancy bypayment of back rent. Nothing in this rule is intended to override State law protections fora tenant who is delinquent in the payment of rent, or to cut short anygrace period which may be required under the State law. The Federal statuteand this rule establish minimum procedural and substantive protectionsfor a public housing tenant. These Federal protections may be supplementedby additional protections which are required by State law, and which donot contravene any element of the Federal Scheme. <T3>d. Fees for Late Payment.</T3> (1) Authority to Levy Fee for Late Payment.The rule (andSection;966.10(e)(2)) permits a PHA to assess the tenant reasonablefees because of late payment of rents or charges to the PHA. Comment states that penalties for late payment should not be allowed, orshould not be allowed for late payment of charges other than rent. Commentstates that because public housing tenants are indigent, late charges increasethe likelihood that a tenant in arrears will not be able to catch up. Insteadof inducing prompt payment, late fees make catching up virtually impossible. Other comment strongly urges retention of late payment penalties. The impositionof penalties for late payment is a tool to assure timely payment by thetenant. Failure to charge penalties for late payment will result in highdelinquency, high turnover and unnecessary use of manpower to collect backrent. The lack of late charges will result in more evictions.  The imposition of late fees is a legitimate way of getting families toput rent or charges on time. The use of late fees for this purpose helpsenforce the statutory requirement for PHAs to establish satisfactory procedures``designed to assure the prompt payment and collection of rents'' (U.S.Housing Act of 1937, section 6(c)(4)(B), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(c)(4)(B)). Bycharging fees for late payment of rent or other charges, the PHA may beable to avoid the need for a more drastic sanction against a non-payingtenant_by evicting the family from the unit. The PHA should be able toutilize lesser remedies, to minimize the need for recourse to more severeactions against the tenants. Comment states that the PHA should not be allowed to levy late fees fornon-payment of charges other than rent, such as charges for maintenanceor for excess consumption of utilities. The late fee is an unreasonablepunishment for a tenant who owes a small amount for charges, or who conteststhe validity of the charge. If tenant is contesting the charge, non-paymentmay create a potential liability equal to the contested charge. Commentalleges that a charge for late payment discourages the tenant from contestingthe charge. The final rule allows the PHA to assess late charges for non-payment ofrent or other charges. The reasons for permitting the PHA to levy latefees apply equally to late payment of PHA charges as to late payment ofmonthly rent. The PHA must have a sanction, short of eviction, that givesthe tenant an incentive to pay up charges owed to the PHA. HUD does not agree that the assessment of a late charge is likely to discouragethe tenant from contesting PHA charges, either through the PHA grievanceprocess or as a defense in an eviction action brought by the PHA. The tenantcan both pay and contest the charge. Alternatively, if the tenant doesnot pay the charge, the possible imposition of a late fee on top of theoriginal charge may fortify the tenant's incentive to contest the charge.Payment of a charge other than rent, including a late charge (for non-paymentof rent or other charges) is not a prerequisite for use of the PHA grievanceprocedure to contest assessment of the charge. Comment states that if a tenant contests the claim of non-payment, thePHA should not be allowed to impose charges for non-payment until the tenantis adjudged responsible. This recommendation is not adopted. When the tenantdoes not pay the rent on time, the PHA suffers administrative and fiscaldamage from the time of non-payment, not merely from the time when thetenant is adjudged responsible for non-payment. (2) Amount of Fee for Late Payment. Comment states that the PHA shouldonly be allowed to impose ``reasonable'' late fees, or proposes variouslimits on the amount of such fees. Comment acknowledges that the PHA mustcharge reasonable late fees as an incentive for prompt payment. However,a requirement that fees must be ``reasonable'' does not give sufficientguidance. Under this broad standard, PHAs will abuse the authority to determinethe amount of the late payment fee. PHAs will impose late fees which areunreasonable. A more explicit rule would promote more reasonable and predictableaction by the PHA. Comment states that a late fee for non-payment of charges other than rentshould bear a relationship to the amount of the charge, should be cappedat a percentage of the amount due, or should not be higher than the amountof the charge. Other comment states that late charges should be based onreasonable compensation for delay, but should not be a ``penalty''. Commentstates that the late charge should not exceed the legal rate of interest.The proposed rule would permit a lease provision which allows the PHA toassess ``reasonable penalties'' for late payment of rent or charges. Thefinal rule provides that the lease may require the tenant to pay ``reasonablefees'' for late payment of rent or charges determined by the PHA andSection;966.10(e)(2)).The term ``fees'', rather than ``penalties'', is used as a more neutraldescription of charges imposed on a tenant who delays payment of rent orcharges. The fees may or may not be intended as a ``penalty''. The standardcontrolling the amount of late payment fees is separately and sufficientlyexpressed by requiring that fees must be ``reasonable''.  The reasonableness standard is flexible, and allows the PHA to considerany appropriate factors in setting the amount of fees for late paymentof rent or charges. For example, the amount of late charges could be designedto meet PHA administrative costs as a result of late payment, or to providean incentive for prompt payment. The amount of the fee could reflect theamount and period of delinquency by a tenant. The amount of the fees couldalso reflect PHA experience with particular tenants. The PHA may electto charge higher fees for a tenant who is habitually delinquent, than foran initial delinquency. The PHA's determination may take into account themotivations or circumstances of a particular tenant, such as the degreeof hardship to the family. A system for determination of late fees maybe based on a formal and detailed articulation of rules. Alternatively,a system may allow considerable room for case-by-case judgment by PHA management,based on knowledge of the family and of the PHA's management imperatives.In all cases, the late fees must be ``reasonable''. HUD finds no reasonor advantage for attempting to limit late fees by a more explicit Federalstandard. It would be difficult to devise a more elaborate and explicitstandard which captures the full range of appropriate considerations summarizedin the concise and flexible requirement that late fees must be reasonable.  HUD also finds no reason for stating any more explicit standard governingthe relationship between the amount of rent or charge owed by the tenant,and the amount of late fee for non-payment of the amount owed. The reasonablenessstandard affords a reasonable restriction on the imposition of fees whichare disproportionate to the amount of the original rent or charge. Moreover,there may be good reasons for establishing a late fee not directly basedon the amount of the original charge. First, the PHA's administrative coststo collect delinquencies may not bear a direct or close relation to theamount of the original charges. Administrative costs to pursue particulardelinquencies may exceed the amounts the PHA is trying to collect. Second,fees may be designed to support integrity of the PHA collection system_byimposing additional fees on a tenant who pays late. In this connection,the relevant question in determining the amount of the fee is not, or neednot be, how much is owned, but how much late fee will be adequate stimulusfor prompt payment. <T3>e. Non-payment of Utility Bill.</T3> Sometimes utilities are paid bythe PHA and included in rent (``PHA-furnished utilities''). Sometimes utilitiesare paid by the tenant, and are not included in the rent (``Tenant-purchasedutilities'') (see generally, andSection;966.10(d)). If utilities are to bepaid by the tenant, a utility allowance is deducted from the tenant's rentto the PHA, so that the tenant will have enough money to pay for utilities.In the final rule, the discussion of utilities is revised by adding a newprovision (andSection;966.10(d)(4)(ii)) concerning a shut-off of tenant-purchasedutilities:``If there are Tenant-purchased utilities, and the utility supplier shutsoff utilities because of Tenant's failure to pay the utility bill, occurrenceof the shut-off shall be considered a serious violation of the lease bythe Tenant.''A utility shut off may damage the structure, and may result in deteriorationof living conditions in the project, for other families as well as thefamily which fails to pay the utility bill. It is the tenant's responsibilityto pay the bill.H. Information and Certification<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Duty to Supply</ITAG>The tenant is required to supply any information which HUD or the PHA determineto be necessary. This includes information needed to determine tenant rent.The rule provides (andSection; 966.10(h)(1)(iv)) that the tenant must:<ITAG tagnum="21">Supply any certification, release, information or documentation whichthe PHA or HUD determines to be necessary, including submissions requiredby the PHA for an annual reexamination or interim reexamination of Familyincome and composition in accordance with HUD requirements * * * *</ITAG>In the final rule, the statement of a tenant's duty is amplified by providing(andSection; 966.10(h)(3)(ii)) that the lease must include a tenant certificationthat:All information or documentation submitted by the Tenant and other membersof the Household to the PHA in connection with any Federal housing assistanceprogram (before and during the lease term) are true and complete to thebest of the Tenant's knowledge and belief.This tenant certification in the lease covers both a submission of informationby the tenant before execution of the lease (such as information submittedto support tenant's application for admission to public housing), and asubmission during the term of the lease (such as information submittedat annual recertification during the term of the lease).PHA comment agrees that the lease should obligate the tenant to supplyinformation or certification demanded by the PHA. However, legal aid commentasserts that a requirement for submission of any PHA-required documentationis overbroad. Tenant privacy should be protected. Comment states that aPHA may demand open-ended releases, which would enable the PHA to obtaininformation which is not relevant. The PHA should only be allowed to requiresubmission of ``relevant'' or ``necessary'' documentation. The rule shouldspecify that the PHA may only require the tenant to furnish informationor releases in connection with family income or family composition.All public housing tenants must supply information on family income andcomposition. The information is needed to determine the rent in accordancewith Federal requirements. A PHA may, however, legitimately determine thatthere is need for other information, for example information bearing onthe possibility of violent or illegal activity by family members. HUD willnot limit the PHA to requiring tenants to furnish information on familyincome or composition.The rule provides that the tenant must supply any information ``which thePHA or HUD <T3>determines to be necessary</T3>'' (andSection; 966.10(h)(1)(iv)). Thusthe tenant's duty to furnish information to the PHA depends on the PHA'sdetermination that the information is ``necessary''. HUD finds no needto change this regulatory language. The PHA must be left the discretionto decide what type of information is necessary, over and above the minimumrequired by HUD. As in most aspects of day-to-day management of publichousing, the PHA should have the flexibility to decide what is needed inthe local public housing program. HUD has no information or reason to believethat the PHA discretion to decide what information is necessary has been,or will be, widely abused.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Failure To Supply_Termination of Tenancy</ITAG>The PHA may determine that the tenant's failure to supply PHA-requiredinformation ``timely'' is a serious lease violation (andSection; 966.21(b)(1)).Comment states that the tenant may not know what ``timely'' means, andthat the term can be abused by the PHA.To submit information ``timely'', the tenant must be told what must besubmitted and when. To clarify this point, the final rule adds a new provision(andSection; 966.10(f)(4)) that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The PHA shall give the Tenant reasonable notice of what certification,release, information or documentation must be supplied to the PHA, andof the time by which any such item must be supplied * * * *</ITAG>The PHA may terminate tenancy for ``serious or repeated'' violation ofthe lease (andSection; 966.21(a)). The proposed rule states that a tenant'sfailure to timely supply to the PHA any certification, release, informationor documentation on family income or composition is a serious violationof the lease.PHA comment welcomes the clarification that the tenant's failure to supplyrequired information is a ``serious'' violation, and is grounds for terminationof tenancy. The lease should provide that the tenant's refusal to completereexamination, provide required verification or sign a required releaseis grounds for eviction. Tenants often fail to respond to the PHA's requestfor recertification or other information. Tenant delay often holds up timelycompletion of reexamination, and causes a great administrative burden forthe PHA. The old rule does not plainly establish that failure to providerequired information is a serious violation of the lease. The new provisionhelps a PHA secure the cooperation of the tenant, and will support thePHA in court if the PHA is forced to terminate the tenancy.Legal aid comment states that a delay in furnishing required informationshould not be grounds for termination of tenancy if the tenant delay isexcusable. The rule should not characterize all tenant failure to provideinformation as a serious lease violation or other good cause. Instead,the rule should provide that a failure to submit the information ``may''constitute a substantial violation or other good cause for termination.The rule should recognize PHA discretion to determine whether a failureto provide information to the PHA is ground for termination of tenancy.PHAs should be encouraged to take difficulties in providing the informationinto account.It is reasonable to assume that the compliance rate will rise if the sanctionfor failure to timely deliver required income or other documentation tothe PHA is sure and quick eviction of the family, and if this message iseffectively communicated to the tenant. Confronted with a tough enforcementpolicy, the tenant will make the extra effort to produce the documentson time. Confronted with a soft enforcement policy, the tenant will findexcuses for failing to produce the documents on time.In response to comment, the rule is amended to explicitly recognize PHAdiscretion to determine whether a failure to provide information to thePHA is ground for termination of tenancy. The rule is revised to providethat ``the PHA may determine'' that the tenant's failure to timely supplyrequired information or documentation is a serious violation of the lease(andSection; 966.21(b)(1)). The determination whether a failure to provideinformation should be grounds for termination of tenancy is made by thePHA.The rule gives the PHA an unambiguous legal right to terminate the tenancyif a tenant does not supply a required document on time. This does notmean that a PHA will automatically evict any tenant who submits a documentlate or incomplete. Even if the PHA has good cause grounds for terminationof tenancy, the PHA has management discretion to decide whether to proceedwith termination and eviction. In making this decision, the PHA may considerany relevant factors concerning the program or the family, including whetherthe tenant is making a good faith effort to produce the documents, or ishindered by external factors beyond the control of the family.In sum, the PHA has discretion to determine whether the failure to providerequired information is a serious lease violation, and also has discretionwhether to evict the family because of the violation.I. Transfer From Unit<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Regulation</ITAG>The final rule provides (andSection; 966.10(h)(1)(v)(A)) that the tenantmust move from a public housing unit if:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The PHA determines the Household is residing in a unit which islarger or smaller than appropriate for the Household size and compositionunder the PHA unit size standards, or determines that the character ofthe unit is otherwise inappropriate for the Household size and composition(such as a unit modified for use or accessibility by handicapped, whichis currently occupied by a Household whose members are not handicapped),or determines that the unit requires substantial repairs, is scheduledfor modernization, or is not in decent safe and sanitary condition, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The PHA offers the Tenant another Public Housing dwelling unit.The Public Housing dwelling unit shall be decent, safe and sanitary andof appropriate size under the PHA unit size standards.</ITAG>The final rule also provides (andSection; 966.10(h)(1)(v)(B)) that the tenantmust move from a dwelling unit if:<ITAG tagnum="21">The dwelling unit is hazardous to the health or safety of the occupants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The rule states (andSection; 966.10(f)(3)) that if a hazardous conditionis not corrected in a ``reasonable time'':</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">* * * the PHA shall offer the Tenant the opportunity to move to areplacement dwelling unit if available. The PHA is not required to offerthe Tenant a replacement unit if the hazardous condition was caused byfault or negligence of household members, or of guests, visitors, or otherpersons under control of household members.</ITAG>The bulk of public comments concern (1) clarity and breadth of the groundsfor transfer, (2) proposals to restrict grounds for transfer, (3) proposalsto add restrictions on acceptability of substitute housing.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Grounds for Transfer</ITAG><T3>a. General</T3>. The PHA may require the tenant to transfer to a replacementunit if the PHA determines:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The family is living in a unit that is larger or smaller than appropriatefor the family size and composition under the PHA unit size standards,or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The character of the unit is otherwise inappropriate for the familysize and composition, or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The unit requires substantial repairs, is scheduled for modernization,or is not in decent, safe and sanitary condition (including a unit whichis hazardous to health or safety of occupants).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For convenience in this discussion, we refer to the cases when a tenantmust move from the public housing unit, to a replacement unit offered bythe PHA, as ``grounds for transfer''.The new rule gives the PHA more control over use of public housing stock,by broadening the grounds for transfer which were allowed under the oldrule. Comment claims that the authorized grounds for transfer under theproposed rule are too broad, and that the PHA is given too much authorityto relocate public housing tenants. Comment states that the proposed groundsfor transfer are a PHA rule of convenience, but do not show a proper regardfor the traumatic or disruptive effects of family relocation. The PHA shouldonly relocate the tenant in extreme circumstances. The rule should incorporateprocedural safeguards to insure that a PHA determination to move the familyis reasonable and necessary.The grounds for transfer stated in this rule are all reasonable bases forrequiring the family to move from the unit, and the tenant must be offereda suitable replacement unit, as discussed in section III.I.4 of this Preamble.The grounds reflect the special character of public housing as distinctfrom private unassisted housing, and the special needs of the PHA in managingthe housing.<T3>b. Unit Too Large or Too Small for Family. </T3>The first ground fortransfer of the tenant to a new unit is a PHA determination that thereis a mismatch between the unit presently occupied by the family, and thepresent size or composition of the family. The PHA determination must bebased on the PHA's general policy (``unit size standards'') governing thesize of dwelling units for public housing families, rather than an ad hocjudgment of the PHA for the individual family required to move. The ruleprovides that the PHA may require the tenant to move if ``the Householdis residing in a unit which is larger or smaller than appropriate for theHousehold size and composition under the PHA unit size standards'' (andSection;966.10(h)(1)(v)(A)(1)).In general, such discrepancies most often arise because there is a changein the size or composition of the family since initial occupancy of theunit by the family. A unit may be too large for the family because familymembers moved out since initial occupancy. A unit may be too small forthe family if family size has grown since initial occupancy (for example,by birth of additional children), and the unit is now overcrowded.The PHA must have the legal right to require the tenant to move from theunit if the family is not the right size for the unit occupied. This authorityallows the PHA to make better use of the PHA housing stock, for the overallbenefit of eligible families. For example, there may be a severe shortageof large units in the PHA projects and in the local housing market. Assumethat a family consisting of a couple with four children was originallyallocated a three bedroom unit under the PHA occupancy policy. The childrengrew up and moved out, and only the parents now remain in the unit. Continuedoccupancy of the three bedroom unit by the two empty-nesters means thatthe unit is denied to a large family in urgent need of the unit.<T3>c. Unit Inappropriate for Family. </T3>The second ground for transferof the family is a PHA determination that the ``character of the unit''is ``otherwise inappropriate'' for the household size and composition (andSection;966.10(h)(1)(v)(A)(1)). Comment asks for an example of what type of occupancyis ``otherwise inappropriate''. The final rule adds the following exampleof a case where the character of the unit may be inappropriate for thehousehold:<ITAG tagnum="21">a unit modified for use or accessibility by handicapped, which iscurrently occupied by a Household whose members are not handicapped.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The PHA may need to move the original family out, so that a handicappedperson who needs the special handicapped features can live in the unit.The PHA should have ample authority to assure that a particular unit isoccupied by the type of family which may best benefit from special characteristicsof the unit.<T3>d. Condition of Unit.</T3> The third ground for transfer of the familyis a PHA determination that the unit ``requires substantial repairs, isscheduled for modernization, or is not in decent, safe and sanitary condition''(andSection; 966.10(h)(l)(v)(A)(1)). This provision is intended to give thePHA necessary flexibility to accomplish needed work on public housing units.The work may be rendered difficult, expensive or impossible if familiesin occupancy cannot be moved to other housing.In addition, the rule provides separate treatment for the special and urgentcase where condition of the dwelling unit is hazardous to occupants. Ingeneral (as discussed in section III.I.4 of the Preamble), the tenant isonly required to move if the PHA offers the tenant occupancy of another<T3>public housing</T3> unit. However, if the unit is hazardous for theoccupants (and the condition is not corrected in a reasonable time), thePHA must offer the opportunity to move to a ``replacement dwelling unitif available'', which may or may not be a public housing unit (andSection;966.10(h)(l)(v)(B) and andSection; 966.10(f)(3)). Thus the rule plainly statesthe correlative obligations of the PHA and the tenant when the unit endangerssafety of the occupants. The PHA is required to offer an available replacementunit, and the tenant must move from the original hazardous unit.The PHA is not required to offer a replacement unit if the dangerous conditionwas caused by ``fault or negligence'' of household members or of ``guests,visitors, or other persons under control of Household members'' (andSection;966.10(f)(3)). The PHA should not, and does not, have to offer a new unitif the family created dangerous conditions in the original unit. A familywith this history may do the same in a new unit_and, by doing so, causeinjury to family members and others, as well as expense and administrativeburden for the PHA. If the PHA does not offer a new unit, the family shouldnot continue to live in a unit which endangers health and safety of theoccupants. If dangerous conditions are not fixed, the family should berequired to move from the unit. Damage or destruction of the unit by faultor negligence of the household is a serious violation of the lease (seeandSection; 966.10(h)(2)(ii)), and is ground for termination of tenancy andeviction of the unit occupants.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Proposed Restrictions on Transfer</ITAG>Public comment proposes a number of additional substantive or proceduralrequirements for transfer of a public housing tenant.Comment recommends that the PHA should only be allowed to transfer thetenant at lease expiration, or that the PHA should not be allowed to transferthe tenant for at least one year after death of a family member, or shouldnot be allowed to transfer the tenant if a transfer would work an unduehardship on the family. These suggestions are not adopted. The proposedrestrictions artificially constrict the ability of the PHA to realize thepurposes of the respective grounds for transfer. For example, a delay intransfer of the family may delay modernization of the unit, or may perpetuateunderuse of an oversize unit.The requirement for a tenant to move from the unit is a contractual conditionof the assisted tenancy, not a condition which may only be exercised atthe end of the lease term. In practice, most PHAs probably use leases whichcontinue month-to-month until terminated for cause. In such cases, a provisionthat the tenant may only be moved at lease termination would have littlepractical effect_at any given time the PHA is no more than a month awayfrom lease expiration.The death of a family member, or other particular family circumstances,may call for understanding and flexibility by the PHA. These varying circumstancesare, however, most properly addressed to the judgment and good sense oflocal PHA management, and are not to be handled by the imposition of arigid, Federally imposed rule that cannot possibly reflect the infinitevariety of personal and local circumstances.Comment suggests that the family should have at least 30 days, or at least120 days, to move from the unit. HUD finds no need to set a uniform Federalnotice period, and has no basis for establishing any particular noticeperiod. PHAs can set reasonable notice periods, and do not need Federalguidance. Both consideration for tenants, and the needs of orderly projectadministration will tend to induce the PHA to give reasonable notice totenants.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Substitute Housing</ITAG><T3>a. Offer of substitute housing.</T3> The existence of grounds for transferis a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for requiring the tenantto move. The PHA must also offer the tenant replacement housing (andSection;966.10(h)(l)(v)(A)).The proposed rule would have allowed the PHA the option of offering thefamily either another public housing unit, or the opportunity to rent aprivate unit with subsidy under the section 8 certificate or voucher programs.Public comment asserts that these alternatives, as framed in the proposedrule, do not afford adequate protection for the interests of the family.<T3>b. Offer of Section 8 Certificate or Voucher.</T3> Comment states thatthe tenant should not be forced to take a section 8 certificate or voucherin place of a public housing unit. Comment claims that the certificateand voucher programs give less protection to the tenant, and are not theequivalent of public housing.In the certificate and voucher programs, a family must find a unit on theprivate rental market. Comment notes that a family may not be able to finda unit. Large families, families with single parents, welfare familiesand minority families have greater difficulty in finding landlords willingto rent. Comment remarks that it will be hard for a PHA to show that aprivate unit is available for occupancy under the certificate or voucherprogram. Comment asks if a handicapped tenant should be forced to moveout of an accessible public housing unit to an inaccessible unit rentedon the local housing market. In the voucher program, the family may beforced to spend more than 30 per cent of income for housing (since thereis no statutory limit on the amount of rent paid by an assisted familyin that program).Comment also points out that in the section 8 certificate and voucher programsthe family does not have security of tenure which is equivalent to publichousing. After one year, the section 8 tenancy can be terminated (for othergood cause, such as a business or economic reason for termination of tenancy).A private landlord may decide to remove the unit from the section 8 program.If the section 8 tenancy is terminated, the family may be left high anddry, unable to find another unit.Comment states that the family should have a right to remain in publichousing, or a right to certificate or voucher assistance, or that the PHAshould give the family a choice between public housing or assistance underthe certificate or voucher programs. The certificate and voucher programsare generally more attractive than public housing. Thus there is usuallya good reason if the tenant elects to remain in public housing, insteadof choosing voucher or certificate assistance.After reconsideration, HUD has removed the proposed provision which wouldrequire the tenant to move if the PHA issues a section 8 certificate orvoucher, and an acceptable unit is available for section 8 assisted occupancyby the family. The final rule provides that the PHA must offer the tenantanother public housing unit. As suggested by public comments, there areimportant differences between public housing and tenant-based housing assistanceunder section 8. It may also be difficult to determine if a private marketunit is in fact available for occupancy by the family with assistance underthe certificate or voucher programs, and thus to determine whether thePHA has satisfied the obligation to offer the tenant replacement housingactually available for occupancy by the family.HUD does not adopt the suggestion that the public housing family shouldbe given a right to issuance of a voucher or certificate.The final rule does not contain a provision governing the offer of continuedassistance under the certificate or voucher programs. The PHA may offera certificate or voucher in accordance with the regular requirements ofthese programs, and the tenant may elect to accept such assistance insteadof remaining in public housing. However, since the transfer from publichousing to section 8 results from the free choice of the PHA and family,and is subject to the ordinary rules governing admission to the section8 programs, there is no need for a regulation provision on this subject.<T3>c. Offer of Another Public Housing Unit. </T3>The tenant must moveif the PHA offers the tenant another public housing unit (andSection;966.10(h)(1)(v)(A)(2)).The replacement unit must be decent, safe and sanitary, and must be ofappropriate size under the PHA occupancy standards. The tenant is not requiredto move to a public housing unit which is substandard or too small forthe family.Comment advocates establishing further restrictions on the character andlocation of the public housing unit which must be offered to the tenant.Comment states that the PHA should have to offer the tenant a unit in thesame project or neighborhood, or in a comparable neighborhood, or thatthe PHA should have to allow the tenant a choice of alternative sites.Comment also states that the PHA should be prohibited from offering thetenant a worse unit, and that the unit offered should be of a comparablehousing type.HUD believes the proposed restrictions would be too hard to apply, andwould unduly constrict flexibility of the PHA in management of its housinginventory. The interests of the family are adequately protected by requiringthat the replacement unit is decent, safe and sanitary, and of appropriatesize.In one circumstance, the tenant may be required to move from a public housingunit even though the PHA has not offered a public housing unit as replacement.If the tenant's public housing unit is hazardous, the PHA must offer areplacement unit if available (andSection;966.10(f)(3)), and the tenant mustmove from the original hazardous unit (andSection;966.10(h)(1)(v)(B)). Inthis circumstance, the PHA is not required to offer a public housing unitas the replacement.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Other Comments on Transfer Policy</ITAG>This section responds to several remaining comments on transfer of publichousing tenants.Comment states that the PHA should be required to reimburse the tenantfor out-of-pocket expenses in moving to a new unit. HUD has not adoptedthis recommendation. The PHA has limited funds to run the public housingprogram. Like most aspect of day-to-day management, the decision on whetherto reimburse the tenant, from the limited resources available to the PHA,is best left to the PHA.Comment states that where a family is moved out of a public housing unitto give the PHA access for repairs, the family should have the right tomove back into the same unit after repairs are made. HUD has not adoptedthis recommendation. The most urgent interest of the family is for shelterin a standard unit, not for occupancy of the particular public housingunit previously occupied by the family. The proposed change could considerablycomplicate the PHA task of coordinating work on public housing units withoccupancy of the units. The comment, if adopted, could reduce the numberof project units available for occupancy by lower income families.Comment states that a PHA determination which requires the tenant to moveto another public housing unit should be covered by the grievance process.HUD agrees. Under the grievance procedures in this rule, a proposed PHAdecision to require the tenant to move to another public housing unit isa grievable subject (``proposed adverse action'') (andSection;966.31(a)(2)(ii))(see discussion in section V.B.2.f of this Preamble). The purpose of thegrievance hearing is to determine whether the proposed PHA decision requiringthe tenant to move violates the lease, or violates other laws or rules.The hearing officer does not have authority to overturn a management decisionby the PHA which requires the tenant to move in accordance with the lease.Comment states that the lease should incorporate standards and proceduresregarding a transfer requested by the family. The PHA should grant alltransfer requests which are based on health, proximity to work or schools,and other such reasons. Comment states that the PHA should be requiredto establish written transfer policies.In this rulemaking, HUD did not propose any new regulation concerning policyon tenant-requested transfers. No public comment was requested on proposalsin this area. HUD does not have any regulatory requirements on this subject,and does not know of any compelling need or general demand for regulationon this subject. The chief thrust of this rulemaking is deregulation, andthe devolution of additional management flexibility to public housing PHAs.A PHA can establish tenant transfer policies without new HUD guidance orcompulsion.A requirement to grant all tenant transfer requests could be enormouslyburdensome and expensive for the PHA. Such a requirement could hinder aPHA in the efficient and equitable allocation and use of public housingunits. The PHA could incur significant additional expense, such as theexpense of fixing up the unit vacated by a tenant who moves to a new unit.Even if a tenant has a substantial reason for wanting a transfer to anotherpublic housing unit, the PHA may determine that other applicants or tenantshave a more urgent need for available units. HUD has not adopted the recommendationto adopt new requirements on tenant-requested transfers.J. Obligation To Allow Inspection of UnitThe final rule simplifies old rule provisions concerning entry and inspectionof the unit by the PHA. The old rule provides that the PHA may enter theunit during reasonable hours, after reasonable advance notice to the tenant,and specifies that two days notice is reasonable. Under the old rule, thePHA may enter without advance notice if the PHA has reasonable cause tobelieve that an emergency exists.In this rulemaking, HUD first proposed to eliminate HUD restrictions onPHA entry of a tenant's unit (proposed rule of December 1982). In responseto public comment on this proposal, HUD proposed provisions which wouldallow the PHA to inspect the dwelling unit at reasonable times and afterreasonable notice (proposed rule of July 1986). The proposed provisionsare revised in this final rule.The final rule provides (andSection; 966.10(k)):<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The lease shall state the purposes for which the PHA may enterthe dwelling unit. The purposes may include entry to inspect the unit,to make repairs or improvements, or provide other services, to show theunit, or for other purposes stated in the lease.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The PHA shall give the Tenant at least 24 hours written noticethat the PHA intends to enter the unit. The PHA may enter only at reasonabletimes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The Tenant shall allow the PHA to enter the unit in accordancewith the lease.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) If the PHA has reasonable cause to believe that there is an emergency,the PHA may enter the unit at any time without advance notice to the Tenant,and may enter without consent of the Tenant. After such entry, the PHAshall give the Tenant a written notice of when the PHA entered the unit,and the reason for such entry.</ITAG>Legal aid comment states that the proposal for a lease provision whichallows PHA to inspect the unit at reasonable times and after reasonablenotice would not adequately protect the tenant's privacy and right of possession.Comment states that the proposed requirement for ``reasonable'' noticeis standardless or subjective. The determination on how much notice isreasonable should not be left to the discretion of the PHA. The proposedchange invites litigation over invasion of the tenant's right to privacy,and will lead to uncertainty and conflict. The old rule is clear, simple,and avoids unnecessary disputes.Comment states that unless a minimum notice period is fixed in the HUDrule, a PHA may set inadequate notice periods. The PHA may allow staffto enter a tenant's apartment while the tenant is away. The proposed changewill allow PHA employees to discriminate among tenants. The rule changeencourages excess involvement by the PHA in the day-to-day lives of thetenants, and PHA spot-checking that violates the tenant's right to privacy.PHA comment generally supports rule changes to facilitate PHA inspectionof the unit. The PHA is responsible for maintaining the unit in decent,safe and sanitary condition. To perform this function, the PHA must makefrequent inspections of the unit. The PHA should be allowed to define reasonablenotice. The old rule is a hardship for the PHA. However, some PHA commentindicates that the old rule does not present major problems.Comment states that except for emergencies, a PHA should be required togive at least two days notice of intention to enter the unit. Other commentrecommends that the notice period should be shortened to 24 hours. Commentnotes that a 24 hour notice period is specific, but not so onerous as tohamstring the PHA.Language of the July 1986 proposed rule did not explicitly state that thePHA has a right to enter the unit without notice or tenant permission incase of emergency. PHA comment recommends that the PHA be allowed to enterthe unit without notice if the PHA has reasonable cause to believe thatthere is an emergency. A provision to this effect was contained in theold rule. Comment suggests that the PHA should be allowed to enter theunit on 24 hours' notice in emergency cases.The final rule provides that in non-emergency cases, the PHA must givethe tenant at least 24 hours' written notice of intention to enter theunit (andSection; 966.10(k)(2)). However, if the PHA has reasonable causeto believe there is an emergency, the PHA may enter at any time withoutadvance notice to the tenant, and may enter without consent of the tenant(andSection; 966.10(k)(4)). However, in this case, the PHA must leave thetenant a written notice of when and why the PHA entered the unit.The inspection requirements in the final rule will permit the PHA to enterthe unit for purposes stated in the lease_for example, to inspect the unitfor tenant-caused damage. At the same time, the 24-hour notice rule fornon-emergency cases sets a definite minimum notice period. The revisiontherefore answers the concern that the lack of a specific minimum noticestandard will lead to disputes, and that PHAs will be prone to give inadequatenotice to tenants.The 24-hour notice period in the final rule is more precise than the noticeprovisions in the old rule. The old rule provided that the PHA must give``reasonable'' notice, and that two days notice is considered reasonablenotice. The language of the old rule implies that the PHA may give lessthan two days' notice if the period is reasonable under the circumstances.Implementation of the old rule therefore requires a judgment of what noticeof less than two days is ``reasonable'' as applied to a particular setof facts.Although the minimum notice period required by this rule is the same forall PHAs, it does not follow that the HUD notice requirements affect allPHAs in the same way. The notice period will have different practical consequencesfor different PHAs and for different circumstances. Some PHAs may chooseto allow a longer notice period, as a matter of management judgment orpreference. In many cases, State law may require a longer notice period.For example, the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (andSection;3.103) provides that ``except in cases of emergency or unless it is impracticableto do so'' a landlord must give a tenant at least two days' notice of intentto enter.Public comment in this rulemaking observe that public housing tenants havean equal right and need for privacy as other apartment dwellers. HUD notesthat the HUD regulation establishes minimum Federal requirements for noticeto a tenant, but does not preempt State laws which require longer noticeto the tenant. Since the HUD regulation does not override tenant rightsunder local law that do not contradict specific provisions of the Federalrule, public housing tenants enjoy tenant rights vouchsafed by State law,as well as Federal protections under the HUD regulations.The provisions allowing immediate entry to the unit in an emergency affordthe PHA flexibility to respond to the most urgent cases, where the PHAshould not have to wait for expiration of a set uniform notice period.For example, if there is a flood in the tenant's apartment, the PHA mayneed quick access to the unit to minimize water damage to the apartmentand to other apartments. In the nature of emergency situations, the PHAmust have the management discretion to decide when the normal one-day waitingperiod is not appropriate. HUD does not believe that operation of the emergencyprovision will commonly be the subject of major dispute. First, the decisionthat there is ground to enter the unit without advance notice depends onthe PHA's own determination that there is ``reasonable cause to believe''that there is an emergency. The spot decision by the PHA is not subjectto challenge if PHA officials believe there is an emergency, and if thereis ``reasonable cause'' for such belief (whether or not it turns out, inretrospect, that the emergency actually existed). Second, in most casesemergency situations will be clear and unambiguous, such as a fire in theapartment.Some PHAs state that the PHA should not be required to give advance noticeof entry for certain routine PHA functions such as pest control or unitrepair. The PHA needs to enter the unit on a scheduled basis to treat forpests. The PHA should be allowed to establish a day of the month when thePHA can enter the unit for this purpose, but without giving notice beforeeach visit. HUD has not adopted the recommendation to authorize a waiver or exceptionfrom the 24-day notice requirement for pest control or other routine functions.The PHA may satisfy the notice requirement by giving definite notice tothe tenants of the scheduled dates when the units will be entered for fumigationor other repetitive purposes. The regulation does not require a separatenotice for each routine visit, so long as the tenant has received a standingnotice of when the visits will be conducted. Similarly, the repair functionswhere the PHA is not able to schedule a definite appointment, the PHA maygive at least 24 hours notice of the period in which the PHA expects thatthe unit will be entered for performance of the work, such as a noticethat the PHA expects to enter the unit for repair work on Thursday or Fridayof the week following notice. Comment states that the rule should require tenant permission for entryto the unit (except in an emergency). The comment notes that while manyhouseholds are headed by women, most PHA maintenance employees are men.The rule should provide that the tenant may not withhold permission unreasonably(compare Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, andSection; 3.103(a)).The final rule provides that the tenant ``shall allow the PHA to enterthe unit in accordance with the lease'' andSection; 966.10(k)(3)). If thePHA seeks admission in accordance with the lease, the tenant is requiredto admit the PHA representatives. Tenant's refusal to ``allow'' (i.e.,consent) to PHA entry is a violation of the lease. Thus, tenant consentis a prerequisite for PHA entry to the unit. Under the final rule, thePHA may enter the unit ``without consent of the Tenant'' only if the PHAis entering the unit because of an emergency (andSection; 966.10(k)(4)).K. Security Deposit The old rule provides that a security deposit may not exceed one month'srent or a ``reasonable fixed amount'' determined by the PHA. The finalrule states that a lease may provide for ``reasonable security depositsas determined by the PHA in accordance with State and local law'' (andSection;966.10(e)(3)). PHA comment states that a PHA should have the right to set the amount ofthe security deposit. The PHA should have freedom to determine what amountof security deposit is reasonable in accordance with local conditions andState law. The PHA should have the right to increase the security depositif a tenant damages the unit. This practice protects the PHA from a tenantwho damages the dwelling unit, and moves out without notice to the PHA.The PHA should be allowed to require an additional deposit if the tenantmakes changes in the unit. Other comment argues that a requirement that the security deposit mustbe ``reasonable'' does not provide sufficient protection for the tenant.Instead, the rule should cap the amount of security deposit which may becollected from a tenant. The deposit should not be more than one monthtenant rent. (By Federal law, tenant rent is usually set at 30 per centof tenant adjusted income.) HUD should establish a specific limit on theamount of security deposit. Some public housing applicants and tenantswill not be able to afford the security deposit demanded by the PHA. HUD concludes that provision that the PHA may determine a ``reasonable''security deposit is an adequate standard to govern PHA practice. Furtherregulatory restriction on the PHA's management discretion is not necessary.In public housing, there should not be a national regulatory restrictionwhich sets a specific and arbitrary formula controlling the amount of securitydeposit, or which prohibits a security deposit of more than one months'tenant rent, as recommended by some comments. Because the rule allows thePHA to determine what deposit is reasonable, the PHA is able to balancethe benefits of holding a tenant security deposit, including the encouragementof tenant responsibility for care of the leased unit, against the difficultyfor the tenant in putting up the amount of security deposit demanded bythe PHA. The PHA can tailor the amount of the security deposit to PHA experienceand policy in the administration of the local program, as well as PHA experiencewith the individual tenant. The PHA may require a higher security depositfrom a problem tenant, with a history of destructive family behavior, thanfrom a tenant with a history of cooperative and responsible behavior. Assuggested by PHA comments, the PHA may demand an increased deposit if theunit has been damaged, or if tenant has made alterations to the unit. Thereasonableness of the security deposit amount may therefore be relatedto the characteristics and behavior of particular families. The PHA doesnot need to impose a security deposit requirement which is identical forall tenants in the PHA program, or in a project. It should also be notedthat since the amount of public housing rent is statutorily determinedby income of the individual family, a security deposit formula based onfamily income will produce different amounts of security deposit for differentfamilies. Thus a rent-based security deposit formula may not provide adequatefinancial security to the PHA, or an adequate incentive for the familyto minimize claims against the security people. In practice, the right of the PHA to determine what amount of deposit isreasonable does not mean that the PHA is free to impose security depositsat any desired level, or at a level that would deny occupancy of the housingto low income families. All public housing units must be occupied by familieswhich are income eligible at the time of initial occupancy. In order tofill public units with eligible families, the PHA will have to set securitydeposits at a level that can be borne by eligible families. Public housing security deposit provisions are not the same as the securitydeposit requirements for the various section 8 programs. In section 8,the landlord is generally a private profit-motivated entity or individual.In public housing, the landlord (i.e., the PHA) is a governmental entityengaged in performance of a public function. The public housing PHA maytherefore be vested with a broader discretionary authority to make decisionsaffecting the welfare of project tenants. In addition, in the various section8 programs the source of financial protection for the landlord is not limitedto the tenant security deposit held by the PHA. In the section 8 programs,the owner may submit a claim for reimbursement from section 8 funds fordamages or other monies owed by the tenant (up to the program maximum).In public housing, there is no parallel source of reimbursement and financialprotection to the landlord-PHA. The old lease and grievance rule states that the lease may allow for gradualaccumulation of the security deposit by the tenant and refund of interestearned on security deposits. This provision is not included in the revisedrule. Provisions allowing gradual accumulation of deposits, and the refundof interest on deposits, are unnecessary. Nothing in the rule prohibitseither practice. L. Prohibited Lease Provisions <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Retention of Prohibition </ITAG>Section 6(l)(1) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as enacted in the 1983law, provides that a public housing PHA must use leases which ``do notcontain unreasonable terms and conditions'' (42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(1)). Thisprovision is worded like section 202(b)(3) of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment amendments of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-557, October 31, 1978), whichrequires HUD to assure that leases approved by HUD for certain HUD-subsidizedmultifamily housing programs do not contain unreasonable terms and conditions.The listing of prohibited types of lease provisions promulgated by HUDfor these programs 48 FR at 43310, September 23, 1983) is almost the sameas the enumeration of prohibited lease provisions in the old public housinglease and grievance rule. Consistent with the 1983 statutory requirement, and with requirements forother HUD housing subsidy programs, the rule describes the types of provisionswhich may not be included in a public housing lease (andSection; 966.11).For the most part, the statement of prohibited provisions bars lease languagewhich could compromise or foreclose the tenant's opportunity for a fairhearing in a State court eviction proceeding, or other court action inconnection with the lease. The statement of prohibited provisions is substantively very similar tothe prohibited lease provisions in the old rule. However, the rule nowincorporates a number of refinements in the list of prohibited provisions,including changes to make the statement easier to understand. The proposedchanges do not substantially impair the common approach in different HUDhousing subsidy programs. Public comment generally approves HUD's revisionto the statement of prohibited lease provisions. The rule does not include specific lease language which conforms with theregulatory list of prohibited lease provisions. The PHA is responsiblefor drafting the language of the lease, and of assuring that the leasedoes not include any prohibited provision. Public comment, including comments by PHAs and NAHRO, supports the prohibitionof unreasonable lease provisions. However, some comment notes that Statelaw may also provide a similar protection for the tenant, and that thePHA should have maximum responsibility in drafting language of the leasein accordance with State law. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Treatment of Family Property</ITAG>Separate old rule provisions restricting the PHA's authority to hold orsell property of the family are combined and revised (final rule andSection;966.11(b); see old rule andSection; 966.6(b) on ``distraint'' for rent andcharges, and old rule andSection; 966.6(e) on disposition of family propertywithout a court decision).The old rule prohibits a lease provision which would authorize the PHAto hold or sell tenant property without notice to tenant and a court decision.PHA comment points out that because of this prohibition, the PHA is notable to dispose of abandoned property when the tenant vacates the unit.The PHA is put to the expense of storing the abandoned property, whichis usually junk. PHA comment states that because of the prohibition, thePHA is forced to wait until the end of the eviction proceeding, and placeremaining possessions at the curb. The provision causes increased expensesand lost rent revenues.Comments states that the PHA should be allowed to dispose of abandonedproperty left by the tenant. Comment suggests alternative techniques forhandling the abandoned property: disposition in accordance with State law,disposition with court approval, or disposition in a commercially reasonablemanner. The lease should include a provision which allows the PHA to disposeof abandoned property. The prohibition on seizure or sale of tenant propertyshould not apply to abandoned apartments.HUD concurs that limitations on PHA handling of property abandoned in theunit are not supported by the underlying rationale of the prohibited leaseprovisions, or, more particularly, of the prohibited provisions concerningtreatment of family property. The prohibition is essentially designed toprevent the seizure or sale of property in the possession of the family,as a PHA self-help remedy for disputes arising under the lease. Once thefamily vacates the unit and property, the abandoned personal property isno longer in possession of the family. The hindrance of PHA dispositionof abandoned property is an unintended and undesirable artifact of a provisiondesigned for a different purpose, and results in unnecessary expense andnuisance for the PHA. In response to PHA comment, the provision on treatmentof family property is revised, with the effect that the prohibition doesnot apply to an agreement concerning disposition of personal property abandonedin the unit.As revised, the final rule provides (andSection; 966.11(b)) that the leasemay not include a provision on treatment of family property under whichthe tenant agrees:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * that the PHA may take, hold or sell personal property of Householdmembers, without notice to the Tenant and a court decision on the rightsof the parties. However, the prohibition of such agreement does not applyto an agreement by the Tenant concerning disposition of personal propertyremaining in the dwelling unit after the Tenant has moved out of the unit.The PHA may dispose of such personal property in accordance with Statelaw.</ITAG>Legal aid comment states that State law may permit a contractual lien ontenant possessions if the rent is not paid. This State-created lien isa self-help remedy by the owner, that does not give a tenant the opportunityfor a judicial hearing. The final rule prohibits an agreement in the leasethat the PHA may take or sell family property without notice to the tenantand a court decision on the rights of the parties.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Waiver of Notice</ITAG>The old rule prohibition against a waiver of legal notice is clarifiedand broadened. The old rule prohibits waiving notice of an action for evictionor a money judgment. Similarly, the new rule prohibits an agreement thatthe PHA does not need to give notice of a court proceeding against thetenant in connection with the lease (andSection; 966.11(d)). However, thenew rule also prohibits an agreement to waive any notice required by HUD.Thus, the tenant may not be required to relinquish in the lease the rightto notice of PHA charges (andSection; 966.10(e)(1)(ii)), of a change in rent(andSection; 966.10(c)(2)), of lease termination (andSection; 966.22) or ofproposed adverse action (andSection; 966.31(b)), or to the notice proceduresrequired under the rule (andSection; 966.10(l)).<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Waiver of Court Decision Before Eviction</ITAG>The prohibition against waiver of the opportunity for judicial determinationon an eviction is clarified (andSection; 966.11(e)). The new rule prohibitsan agreement by the tenant that:<ITAG tagnum="21">the PHA may evict Household members (1) without instituting a civilcourt proceeding in which the Tenant has the opportunity to present a defense,or (2) before a decision by the court on the rights of the parties.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The new language is intended to express more fully the prohibitionof any lease provision which would deny the family the opportunity fora fair hearing in court before eviction from the unit. This provision supportsother related provisions of the rule (andSection; 966.22(b)(4); andSection;966.23(a)).<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Other Revisions of Prohibited Lease Provisions</ITAG>For clarity, the prohibition of ``exculpatory clauses'' (old rule andSection;966.6(c)) is redesignated as a prohibition of a clause ``excusing PHA fromresponsibility'' (new rule andSection; 966.11(c)).The rule includes other editorial changes and refinements in the list ofprohibited provisions.M. Distinction Between ``Tenant'', ``Family'' and ``Household'' <ITAG tagnum="81">1. General</ITAG>The old rule uses the term ``tenant'' to designate the lessee of a publichousing unit. The tenant is the party who enters into a lease with thePHA on behalf of the family (see old rule andSection; 966.4). The tenantis also the party who possesses the right to a grievance hearing. In somecontexts, the old rule refers to members of the tenant's ``household'',i.e., the body of family members residing in the unit under the lease.In the required and prohibited lease provisions of the old rule (old rulePart 966, Subpart A), the term ``tenant'' is not explicitly defined. However,the term is defined for purpose of the grievance requirements (old rulePart 966, Subpart B). In that context, ``tenant'' is defined as the ``lesseeor the remaining head of household'' (old rule andSection; 996.53(f)).The final rule gives separate definitions of the terms ``tenant'' and ``household''(new rule andSection; 966.2). The new definitions express the important technicaldistinction between the lessee of the unit (the ``tenant''), and the wholebody of persons who are approved to live in the unit under the lease (the``household''). This distinction is also implicit in the old rule. Thenew definitions apply to all parts of the revised lease and grievance requirements,including the lease requirements, the provisions on termination of tenancy,and the grievance hearing requirements.By law, public housing is for the benefit of a ``family'' (U.S. HousingAct of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437 <T3>et seq.</T3>). In this rule, the term ``tenant'' is defined to denotethe legal representative of an assisted family: ``the person or personswho execute the lease with the PHA'' (andSection; 996.2). As in conventionallandlord-tenant usage and practice, the ``tenant'' is the person who holdsthe contractual right to occupancy under the lease, and the right to enforcethe obligations of the landlord under the lease (the PHA). The tenant iscontractually bound to perform all tenant obligations under the lease.The proposed rule contained a separate definition of the term ``family''.This proposed definition compressed two distinct concepts: the propositionthat unit occupants must be approved by the PHA, and the proposition thatthe unit occupants must be a statutory ``family'' as determined in accordancewith HUD requirements, the statutory entity eligible for public housingassistance (see (United States Housing Act of 1937, section 3, 42 U.S.C.1437a; cf. 24 CFR Part 912). However, the group of approved occupants sometimesincludes a person who is not a member of the statutory ``family''. A live-inaide may reside in the unit to provide care and assistance to an elderlyfamily (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 3(b)(3), 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(3);andSection; 966.10(g)(2)).For greater precision, the final rule distinguishes the concepts of ``family''and ``household''. The defined term ``household'' (andSection; 966.2) refersto the whole body of unit occupants who are allowed to live in the unitunder the lease with the PHA (including a live-in aide):<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Household. </T3>The Tenant and other persons who live in the dwellingunit with written approval of the PHA.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(See also, andSection; 966.10(b)(1), which provides that the lease muststate ``the persons who will live in the dwelling unit''.) Most lease provisionsconcern all unit occupants, as opposed to ``family'' occupants. For example,the lease provides that members of the ``household'' may not engage incriminal activity in the unit or premises (andSection; 966.10(h)(2)(iii)).In this context, it is irrelevant whether the household member is alsoa member of the ``family''. In most cases, the set of household membersis identical with the family. In a few contexts, the rule refers to the ``family''. A number of provisionsrefer to the reexamination of ``family'' income and composition; statutoryrent is based on income and composition of the family. However, the term``family'' is not defined in this rule. First, the lease provisions donot define what persons or body of persons are eligible for assistance,although the PHA must determine statutory eligibility before admittingthe family to occupancy of the unit. Second, HUD does not prescribe, inthis or any other public housing rule, a comprehensive definition of whena group of persons may be treated by the PHA as a ``family'' which is eligiblefor assistance under the public housing program. (HUD regulations onlydefine when an elderly or other single person may qualify as a ``family''(see andSection; 912.2).) The PHA has broad discretion to determine whatgroup of persons constitute a family. This rule is not intended to limitor affect PHA authority in this regard. Throughout the rule, the defined terms ``tenant'' and ``household'' areused in the appropriate contexts. For example, the lease provides thatthe ``tenant'' shall have the right to exclusive use and occupancy of thedwelling unit ``for residence by the Household'' (andSection; 966.10(g)(1)).During the lease term, the PHA may offer the ``tenant'' a new lease orrevision of the lease (andSection; 966.10(o)(1)). Public comments object to the explicit regulatory distinction between thetenant and the family under the proposed rule. Comment is concerned withthe supposed effects of this distinction on rights of family members otherthan the tenant signatory, including concerns respecting notice under thelease, and the rights of other family members if the tenant leaves theunit. In the final rule, the central distinction between the tenant signatoryand the whole body of unit occupants is retained (although, as indicatedabove, the terminology has been changed). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Rights of Other Family Members </ITAG>Comment claims that the separate definition of the terms tenant and familydenies tenant rights and protections to other family members. Comment statesthat the family-tenant distinction is artificial since a family is theentity which is eligible for public housing. The PHA should be requiredto include as parties to the lease all family members, or all adult familymembers, or all family members who want to sign the lease. The PHA shouldhave ``privity of contract'' with each adult member of the household. In HUD's view, the distinction between the person who signs the lease withthe landlord, and the body of people who live in the unit in accordancewith the lease, is not artificial, but is a real-world distinction thatantedates the explicit regulatory definition of these concepts in the newrule. This distinction existed implicitly in implementation of the oldrule, notwithstanding the absence of a consistent regulatory definitionwhich applied across the lease and grievance requirements. For example,the lease requirements of the old rule state that the dwelling unit mayonly be used as a dwelling for the ``tenant'' and ``the tenant's household''(old rule andSection; 966.4(f)(3)). In ordinary landlord-tenant practice,the term ``tenant'' conventionally applies only to the individual or individualswho execute the lease for a unit, not to all of the individuals who mayreside in the unit. A residential lease commonly lists the people who maylive in the unit. The new rule introduces an explicit definition of the distinction betweenthe lessee and the unit occupants. By a conscious and consistent use ofthe defined terms, the new rule clarifies the intended operation of leaseand grievance provisions which use the defined terms, and thus the rightsand duties of the tenant under the lease and under the PHA grievance procedure.As under a private market lease, the tenant is the party who holds thecontractual right to enforce the lease. The lease provisions required bythis rule are not intended to make the non-tenant family members thirdparty beneficiaries, who may directly enforce the obligations of the leaseagainst the PHA. For administration of the lease, the PHA needs a precise legal definitionof the tenant who is the subject of rights and duties under the lease.It is both practical, and consistent with normal landlord-tenant practice,that certain members of the family act as legal representatives of thefamily. There is nothing in the lease requirements of the 1983 law whichalters the normal expectation that the ``tenant'' is the repository ofcontractual rights under the lease. In public housing, assistance is forthe benefit of a ``family''. This circumstance supports the implicationthat the PHA may treat the family as a group, represented by the individualor individuals who executes the lease on behalf of the family, not merelyas a collection of individuals residing in the unit. Under the final rule, the PHA will have the authority to determine whichfamily members will be required or allowed to sign the lease on behalfof the family. This judgment may be legitimately affected by elements oflocal law and landlord tenant practice, for example, the age of contractualresponsibility under State law, or procedural complications by additionof additional signatories under the lease. There is no present reason forestablishing a Federal rule defining which family members sign the publichousing lease as representatives of the assisted family. The public housing lease establishes a single tenancy, for the benefitof the whole family. The leasehold is not a set of separate leases foreach individual who lives in the unit. For the most part, the determinationof which member or members of the family signs the lease as ``tenant''on behalf of the family is of little practical importance. Regardless ofwho signs the lease, public housing rent is based on the income of thewhole family, and all members of the family may be evicted if the rentis not paid. Similarly, the whole family may be evicted for breach of tenantobligations by any member of the family. In general, the family's securityof occupancy is little affected by who happens to execute the lease aslegal representative of the assisted family.Comment expresses concern that the tenant-family distinction will in somefashion deny to family members other than the tenant the protection againstprohibited lease provisions. However, HUD notes that the tenant-familydistinction, or the tenant-household distinction, does not permit the PHAto evade the prohibited lease provisions for family members other thanthe tenant. By virtue of the prohibited lease provisions, certain typesof provisions may not be included in the lease between the PHA and tenant.The tenant is not bound by agreement of other family members to relinquishleasehold protections in contravention of prohibited lease provisions.The tenant's tenure of the unit for occupancy by family members is notaffected by any side-agreements between the PHA and other family members.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Notice</ITAG>The rule describes how the PHA must serve notice of lease termination ornotice of a proposed adverse action (andSection; 966.10(l)(2)(ii)). Noticemust be served on the ``tenant'', the person who executes a lease on behalfof the family.Comment states that individual family members should be given separatenotices, or that notices should be directed to the tenant ``and family''.Comment claims that if notice is only given to the ``tenant'', the familymay have no notice that legal rights are being terminated.There is a single lease for each family. Similarly, issues which are cognizableunder the PHA grievance procedure pertain to the whole family (e.g., computationof family rent), and the tenant has a unitary right to grieve on each grievableissue. Individual family members do not have separate individual leasesor separate individual rights to grieve on a proposed adverse action bythe PHA (e.g., a proposed termination of the tenant's lease). Correspondingto the unitary character of the rights which are protected by the lease,and by the PHA grievance procedure, the rule requires a single notice tothe tenant, rather than separate notices to individual family members.The tenant is the legal representative of the family, both for purposesof the lease and for purposes of the grievance procedure.Comment states that notice should be given to individual family members.Mechanically, this could mean either that notice is given by multiple separatenotices to the individual members, or that a single notice is addressedto more individuals or to the ``family''.Multiple notices to an individual family will evidently multiply the burdenand expense of giving a notice (of adverse action or lease termination)which is required under the 1983 law. Imposition of this extra burden andexpense is not justified. Multiplication of the number of individual noticesdoes not multiply the underlying right which is protected by the notice.Indeed, the use of separate notices to individual family members wouldlead to confusion as to who is entitled to act for the family. HUD doesnot believe that the use of multiple notices will substantially increasethe likelihood of actual notice to the family, and_most important_the likelihoodof effective action to protect family interests. PHAs are already burdenedby substantial procedural requirements not borne by a private landlord,including the duty to give notice of lease termination or notice of adverseaction in accordance with the 1983 law. HUD will not add to that burdenby requiring the PHA to give multiple notices to an individual family.Adding additional names as addressees of a single notice to the assistedfamily does not impose the same administrative burden and expense as multipleseparate notices to the family. However, HUD does not believe that a requirementto address additional family members is likely to produce any substantialbenefit. As already remarked, there is only one lease and one right togrieve, not separate rights for each member of the family. All notice shouldgo to the tenant_who is the only family member who may exercise rightsunder the lease or the PHA grievance procedure.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Rights of Remaining Family Members</ITAG>Comment claims that the tenant-family definitions prejudice the interestof family members remaining in the unit after death or departure of the``tenant''. Comment objects that the tenant is the only family member whois entitled to legal notice and continued possession of the unit. If thehusband-tenant dies or leaves the unit, the wife and child have no legalright to continued occupancy. If a grandparent-tenant dies or leaves, thefate of remaining family members is left to the ``whimsey'' of the projectmanager. Comment notes that the goal of the public housing law is to providedecent, safe and sanitary housing for ``families''. If a family is devastatedby loss of an adult member, or if composition of the family is changedby divorce, family stability should not be undermined by loss of the onlyhousing the family can afford.Comment states that other family members should be allowed to remain inthe unit after departure of the tenant if the remaining family membersmeet established PHA occupancy criteria_such as whether the remaining familymember is a PHA-approved occupant who has lived continuously in the unit,and is a blood relation of the named lessee. Comment states that remainingfamily members should automatically succeed to rights of the tenant, andthat a new lease should not be required. Other comment asks clarificationwhether a remaining person is automatically eligible to sign a new lease.Comment suggests that the treatment of remaining family members shouldbe left to PHA discretion.In this rulemaking, HUD did not propose any substantive change in the rightsof remaining family members after death or departure of the tenant-lessee.The introduction of the new definition of term ``tenant'' does not substantiallyalter the position of remaining family members under the old rule and otherprior HUD regulatory requirements.  Under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 assistance is provided to a ``family''.The statutory term ``family'' is defined to include the ``remaining memberof a tenant family'' (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 3(b)(3)(C), 42U.S.C. 1437a(b)(3)(C)). Under the statutory definition, the remaining memberor members of the original family (after departure of the tenant or otherfamily members) constitutes an entity within the statutory definition of``family'', and therefore an entity which is statutorily eligible for publichousing assistance.  However, the existence of statutory eligibility does not mean that theremaining family members (or the remaining adult members) should automaticallysucceed to the interests of the prior lessee. Nor does it mean that thePHA is or should be required to offer a new lease to remaining membersof the family. The PHA may only admit a family if the family is eligible.However, the PHA is also charged with the crucial management responsibilityand discretion to decide whether the remaining members of a family, aspresently constituted after departure of the original tenant, should beassisted, either in the same unit or another unit.After departure of the original tenant, the PHA has a legitimate managementinterest in determining whether the remaining family members constitutea viable or stable household, or whether continued occupancy by the familypresents dangers to other residents or the project, or to the welfare offamily members (for example, if there is no adult who can undertake toact as tenant and head of household, and care for minor members of thefamily). As at the point of initial admission, the PHA may consider thatthe presence of a reliable household head is essential for continued occupancyby the family. Remaining family members may not include any non-minor withlegal capacity to execute a lease, or may not include any persons who canserve as the stable core of the reconstituted family, and who can answerfor the legal responsibilities of tenant under the lease.  As indicated by public comment, death or departure of the named tenantoften presents profound difficulties to the remaining family members. Inthese varied situations, the PHA has the hard job of deciding whether theremaining members can stay in the unit. However, as under the old leaseand grievance rule, the decision on the appropriate solution is properlyvested in the administrative discretion of the PHA. In practice, most PHAsare probably inclined to permit continued occupancy by remaining familymembers unless there is a compelling reason to refuse continued occupancyby the family. N. General Notice Procedures  During the lease term, the PHA and the tenant need a mechanism to givenotice to each other on subjects related to the tenancy under the lease.For example, the PHA may give notice of a reexamination of family income,or of the new rent determined as a result of reexamination. The tenantmay give notice that the tenant requests a grievance hearing on the PHA'sproposed determination of tenant rent. The rule provides (andSection; 966.10(l)(1)):  ``The PHA shall adopt a notice procedure which is consistent with Stateand local law, and which shall be incorporated into the lease. The noticeprocedure shall state how the PHA and Tenant may give notice to each otherconcerning termination of the lease, and other matters under the lease''.O. Notice of Adverse Action or Lease Termination_How Served<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Service of Statutory Notice_Methods</ITAG>The PHA must give the tenant notice of lease termination (andSection; 966.22),or notice of a proposed adverse action (andSection; 966.31(b)). These noticesimplement statutory requirements under the 1983 law. The PHA must giveminimum notice of lease termination (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section6(l)(3), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(3)). The tenant must also be advised of thespecific grounds of any proposed adverse action by the PHA (U.S. HousingAct of 1937, section 6(k)(1), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)(1)). A notice of adverseaction informs the tenant of the reasons for a proposed adverse action(andSection;966.31(b)(1)(i)). The rule establishes the same procedures forservice on the tenant of both types of notice required under the 1983 law(andSection;966.10(l)(2)(ii)).A PHA may use any one of three alternative methods to serve the notice.The rule provides (andSection;966.10(l)(2)(ii)) that a notice of lease termination,or a notice of proposed adverse action, shall be given to the tenant: <ITAG tagnum="21">(A) by mailing the notice by first class mail addressed to the Tenantat the dwelling unit, or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) by handing a copy of the notice to the Tenant or to any adultanswering the door at the dwelling unit, or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) by other means which the PHA determines to be reasonably likelyto give the Tenant actual notice. Posting on the outside of the unit door,and which is not supported by other notice to the Tenant does not constitutesufficient notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Notice by Mail </ITAG><T3>a. When Notice Is Effective. </T3>If notice is mailed, the PHA doesnot have direct knowledge of the date when the notice is received by thetenant. For a notice of lease termination, a tenant must be given noticeof lease termination for the minimum periods stated in the 1983 law (e.g.,14 days notice of termination for non-payment). It is therefore helpfulto specify when the mailed notice is deemed effective, starting the countdownof the 14 day notice period.  The proposed rule contains provisions which specify the point at whicha notice sent by mail is effective. The proposed rule provides that a mailednotice (of adverse action or lease termination) is ``deemed given'' fivedays after the notice is mailed by first class mail. The five day noticeperiod was intended to allow time for the tenant to receive the noticethrough the mails, and define the time at which the termination noticeis legally effective.  PHA comment states that the five day notice period is excessive allowancefor delivery by first class mail. Legal aid comment recommends adding anadditional five days for response by the tenant.  PHA comment accurately points out that the proposed five day initial period(running from the date of mailing to the date when the notice is ``deemedgiven'') effectively lengthens the notice of lease termination requiredby the statute (running from the date the notice is given to the date oflease termination) (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(l)(3), 42 U.S.C.1437d(l)(3)), andSection; 966.22(a)). The initial notice period would beadded on top of the statutory notice of lease termination. In this way,the PHA would have to give 19 days notice of lease termination for nonpaymentof rent (14 days statutory notice, plus a 5 day period for delivery ofthe notice), and 35 days notice of lease termination in other cases (30days statutory notice, plus a 5 day delivery period). PHA comment states that the additional 5 day delivery period delays PHAaction which is necessary to collect rent or deal with residents who createdisturbances, or are otherwise a detriment to the health and safety ofstaff and other residents. These delays are costly, and increase tenantreceivables and collection losses. HUD requirements in the old rule alreadygive the tenants too long to pay. The rule should not give the tenantsmore time. Comment remarks that the new notice period requirement is pyramidedon top of the time necessary to accomplish other steps to initiate legalaction and schedule a hearing for tenant non-payment (PHA grace period,delivery period, 14 days notice of lease termination, period for schedulingcourt hearing). In response to the public comment, the rule is revised to provide thata notice of lease termination or notice of proposed adverse action is treatedas given when mailed. The rule provides (andSection; 966.10(1)(2)(iii)):<ITAG tagnum="21">If a notice of lease termination or a notice of proposed adverse actionis sent by mail, the notice is deemed given when mailed.</ITAG>Allowance of an initial period for delivery of the lease termination notice(in addition to the statutory lease termination notice periods specifiedin section 6(l)(3) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(3))is not required under the 1983 law. The old rule did not require that thePHA make any additional allowance of a period for delivery of a lease terminationnotice which is sent by mail. The lease termination notice provisions inthe 1983 law codify the notice requirements in the old rule. The 1983 HouseCommittee Report states that the bill requires that the lease contain certainbasic protections, including:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * clauses obliging PHAs to * * * provide adequate notice beforeevicting tenants. The Committee also contemplates that HUD will retainthe existing regulations regarding these provisions (Report 98-123 on H.R.1, p. 36).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(Provisions on public housing leases, including provisions which requirethe PHA to give notice of lease termination, were enacted verbatim in theform reported by the House Committee. These provisions therefore differfrom the grievance hearing requirements, which were substantially modifiedin the law as finally passed.)<T3>b. Use of Registered or Certified Mail.</T3> The proposed rule statesthat where the notice is mailed, the notice is ``deemed given'' (1) fivedays after mailing, or (2) when sent return receipt requested, the dateof actual receipt as stated on the return receipt. PHA comments note significanttechnical problems with this provision when the notice is sent by registeredor certified mail. PHAs request clarification that a notice by registeredor certified mail is effective no later than the effective date for a noticesent by regular mail.Under the final rule, a notice is deemed given at the time the notice ismailed (rather than five days <T3>after</T3> mailing) (andSection; 966.10(l)(2)(iii)). The same simplerule applies to registered or certified mail as to ordinary mail. The finalrule does not include the proposed provision which would make the noticeeffective upon the actual receipt date shown on a return receipt. Thisprovision is not needed, since the notice is effective when mailed.Some comment states that notice should always be sent by registered orcertified mail. Other comment points out that tenants often refuse to acceptregistered or certified mail, since such mail often contains a legal noticeor claim. PHA comment states that notice by registered or certified mailis prohibitively expensive.The rule does not require use of registered or certified mail. In a courtproceeding for eviction, the PHA will have to prove that the PHA has giventhe tenant the notice required by Federal law, including satisfaction ofthe minimum notice periods under the statute and regulation. The Departmentconsiders it unnecessary to specify, as a matter of Federal regulation,the form of proof to be offered by the PHA (by affidavit of service, returnreceipt, testimony or other probative means), just as the Department doesnot seek to prescribe the manner in which the PHA must prove the factualexistence of good cause grounds as required under the statute. Each PHAmay decide whether it is best to give notice by registered or certifiedmail, or by ordinary mail, or by other authorized methods of service.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Notice by Personal Service</ITAG>The rule provides that the PHA may serve a notice of lease terminationor proposed adverse action ``by handing a copy of the notice to the Tenantor to any adult answering the door at the dwelling unit'' (andSection; 966.10(l)(2)(ii)(B)).The December 1982 proposed rule would have allowed service by deliveringa copy of the notice to any person answering the door at the dwelling unit.Comment states that the PHA should not be permitted to serve notice ona child who answers the door. In response to this comment, the rule wasrevised to provide that the PHA may only serve the notice on an adult whoanswers the door. HUD agrees that service of notice on a minor child whoanswers the door, and not supported by some other form of notice to thetenant, may not not provide adequate notice. If the PHA is unable to servean adult at the dwelling unit, the PHA can use an alternative mode of serviceallowed under the rule, such as service by mail.The old rule provided that notice must be delivered to the tenant, or toan adult member of the tenant's household residing in the dwelling unit.Comment on the December 1982 rule objects to allowing the PHA to leavenotice with any adult who answers the door, and states that the rule shouldrequire service on an adult member of the household, as under the old rule.Delivery to any adult in the unit does not afford a sufficient likelihoodof actual notice. Comment asks how the person delivering the notice isto know the age of a person who answers the door.The final rule allows the PHA to make service on any adult who answersthe door. HUD believes that in most cases such service will provide actualnotice to the tenant, regardless of whether the person is a member of thehousehold. Indeed, it is doubtful that service on a household member otherthan the tenant is more likely to provide actual notice than service onany adult who answers the door.HUD recognizes that a person who answers the unit door may be an unauthorizedoccupant of the unit. Some PHAs have high levels of occupancy by personsnot admitted by the PHA. However, it is fair that a tenant who permitsillegal occupancy should bear the risk that these persons may not informthe tenant of PHA notices.In many projects, a PHA representative who serves the notice may not knowthe family members. Consequently, the server may not know whether a personwho answers the door is a member of the household, i.e., a person whoseoccupancy in the unit is approved by the PHA. The server also may not know,other than by appearance and common sense judgment, whether the personwho answers the door is a minor.The PHA should not be burdened with the necessity of determining or provingthat an adult who opens the door to the unit is a member of the household.In most cases, the person will be a member of the household, or a personwho will pass the notice on to members of the household. Thus this modeof service is reasonably likely to give the tenant actual knowledge ofthe PHA notice. If notice is handed to a person other than a member ofthe household, the person is usually in the unit with consent of householdmembers. The risk that such a person may not transmit the notice to thetenant is most reasonably apportioned to the tenant who granted the personaccess to the unit, either as an illegal occupant or as a guest of thefamily.There is some risk that in some cases the PHA representative may not knowif the person who opens the door is a minor. However, this problem mayarise in relatively few cases. In many cases, the server will know, withoutserious ground of doubt, that the person who answers the unit door is anadult. In other cases, it will be equally clear that the person who answersthe door is a minor. The problem therefore only arises in the limited proportionof cases where it is not clear to the server that the person is eithera minor or an adult. In such cases, the problem may often be solved byfurther inquiry, or by re-serving the notice at another time, when thetenant or another adult is present. Alternatively, the PHA may solve theproblem by serving the notice by some other authorized means, commonlyby sending the notice by first class mail addressed to the tenant.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Notice by Other Means</ITAG>The proposed and the final rule provide that the PHA may make service ``byother means which the PHA <T3>determines to be reasonably likely to give the Tenant actual notice</T3>'' (andSection; 966.10(l)(2)(ii)(C)) (emphasis supplied). Legal aid commentcontends that this formula would allow the PHA to make service by postingnotice on the unit door, a service technique held unconstitutional by theSupreme Court in <T3>Greene v. Lindsey</T3> , 456 U.S. 444, 102 S. Ct. 1874 (1982). Commentalso claims that the rule will allow eviction without actual notice, andwill result in sewer service. HUD should require service of notice in-handor by return receipt notice.In the <T3>Greene</T3> case, the Supreme Court held that posting of an evictionnotice on the apartment door of housing project residents does not satisfyminimum standards of procedural due process. The Court states that dueprocess in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice whichis ``reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances'' to give actualnotice of the proceeding (456 U.S. at 449, 102 S. Ct. at 1878).The service standard stated in the HUD rule (for use of a service techniqueother than mail, or delivery of notice to an adult who answers the unitdoor) is a close restatement of the Constitutional standard enunciatedin <T3>Greene. </T3>The rule directs that the alternative service techniqueused by the PHA must be reasonably calculated to provide actual notice.Since posting on the unit door (not supported by other means of givingnotice) is not a technique which is reasonably likely to give actual notice,such service is not permitted under the standard stated in the proposedand final rule.  Nevertheless, because the question was raised in public comment, and forabsolute clarity as to HUD's intention, the final rule adds_in additionto the general standard governing adequacy of alternative service techniques_anexplicit statement that ``posting on the outside of the unit door, andwhich is not supported by other notice to the Tenant, does not constitutesufficient notice'' (andSection; 966.10(l)(2)(ii)(C)). The final rule retainsthe general standard in the form previously stated, since the standardis necessary for evaluation of the adequacy of alternative service techniquesnot specifically described in the rule.  Comment objects to allowing the PHA to make service by sliding the noticeunder or through the door. The rule does not mention or prohibit serviceby sliding the notice under or through the door. For alternative modesof service not described in the proposed rule, the question is whetherthe PHA determines that the method of service used by the PHA is ``reasonablylikely'' to give actual notice to the tenant.  All of the service techniques allowed under the rule meet the standardsof procedural due process as they would be applied to a proceeding fordeprivation of tenant's right to occupancy of the property. However, HUDbelieves that the standards for service of a notice of adverse action,or of a notice of lease termination, are not subject to due process requirements,since they are not necessary to assure a due process hearing before deprivationof the tenant's property right to occupancy of the unit. The rule providesthat a PHA may only evict the family from the dwelling unit through a civiljudicial proceeding in which the family has the opportunity to presenta defense (andSection; 966.23(a)). The judicial procedure for eviction ofthe tenant is subject to all the panoply of procedural due process, includingthe Constitutional requirements for adequate notice of the eviction proceeding.The instant rule does not attempt to prescribe notice procedures respectingthe State judicial proceeding for eviction of the tenant. Those noticeprocedures are established by State law, and are subject to due processrequirements under the Fourteenth amendment.  Under the 1983 law, the tenant has a statutory right to notice of leasetermination. Satisfaction of this Federal notice requirement is a statutoryand regulatory prerequisite for termination of the lease and eviction ofthe tenant. Similarly, the tenant has a statutory and regulatory rightto notice of a proposed adverse action. The question respecting adequacyof the process for service of these statutory notices is whether the noticeprocedure satisfies the statute and regulation. However, since the statutorynotice does not finally determine the tenant's right to continued occupancyof the unit (which is determined in the judicial proceeding for evictionof the tenant, after Constitutional notice and opportunity to be heard)the adequacy of the statutory lease termination notice is not tested byConstitutional standards for procedural due process, but by consistencywith the statute and regulation.  The rule provides that service must be by other means which ``The PHA determines''are reasonably likely to give actual notice. This does not mean that PHAdiscretion to determine adequacy of alternative means of service is absolute.The PHA determination is subject to judicial review, under Constitutional,statutory or common law principles governing review of administrative action.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Notice to Handicapped  </ITAG>A tenant may be handicapped. The final rule adds a new provision whichencourages the PHA to give supplemental notice to a handicapped tenantif the PHA has reason to believe that the ordinary forms of notice maynot give actual notice to a handicapped tenant. Section 966.10(l)(3) providesthat:<ITAG tagnum="21">If the PHA believes that the notice procedure otherwise used by thePHA may not give adequate notice to handicapped Tenants, the PHA noticeprocedure may incorporate additional procedures for giving notice to suchTenants. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">6. Relation Between Forms of Notice  </ITAG>Comment states that the PHA should be required to attempt personal service,before using mailing or another method of service. Comment also statesthat the PHA should combine notice by mail with another service methodlikely to provide actual notice to the tenant, such as personal serviceor service at the dwelling.  Notice by mail, or by any of the other service procedures authorized inthis rule, will generally communicate actual notice to the tenant. Anyof the authorized services techniques is likely give adequate notice tothe tenant.  HUD finds no justification for preferring one service technique to another,or for requiring use of one type of permitted service before using anothertype of service. HUD does not require that the PHA attempt personal servicebefore trying another type of service. A requirement that the PHA mustfirst try to make personal service would delay PHA action to terminatethe lease, or take adverse action. The requirement would also impose aconsiderable administrative burden on the PHA.  HUD also will not require that mailed service must be supplemented by servicethrough other means. Mailed service is generally an effective procedurefor notice to the tenant. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. State Law Requirements for Serving Termination Notice  </ITAG>Comment states that a notice of termination of tenancy under the rule shouldbe given in accordance with State or local law, instead of federally imposedstandards. The service requirements stated in this rule are intended toassure that the tenant has ``adequate written notice'' of lease termination,as required by section 6(l)(3) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C.1437d(l)(3)), and to give the family notice of proposed adverse action(pursuant to section 6(k) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)). The HUD regulation does not override service requirements imposed by Statelaw. For termination of tenancy and eviction of the unit occupants, thePHA must satisfy any notice requirements imposed by State law and procedure.State law notices must be given in compliance with State law. Notices requiredin connection with the judicial termination procedure under State law mustof course fulfill the requirements of procedural due process.P. Tenant Comment on Lease Form or PHA Rules The rule eliminates old rule requirements that a PHA allow 30 days fortenant comment on changes in the PHA lease form (old rule andSection; 966.3),or on changes in PHA rules or schedules of PHA special charges (old ruleandSection; 995.5). Legal aid comment objects to the elimination of tenantcomment requirements. PHA comment supports this revision of the rule. Legal aid comment notes that tenants are affected by changes in the PHAlease and rules. The tenants should have the opportunity for basic inputinto a document which governs how they live. They are best able to determinethe effect of PHA rules, and to propose alternatives. The elimination oftenant comment deprives the tenant of a meaningful opportunity for input.Legal aid comment states that giving tenants a chance to comment on proposedrevisions of the PHA lease form or PHA rules is good management practice,and creates a better dialogue between the PHA and its tenants. PHA commissionersare not intimately familiar with how the lease is administered. Considerationof tenant comment, as required by the old rule, improves the lease usedby the PHA, but permits the PHA to implement necessary policies. PHAs oftenmake changes requested by the tenants. The 30 day period for tenant commentdoes not cause significant delay in implementation of justifiable changesin the PHA lease or rules. Under the old rule, the PHA is not forced toaccept a tenant comment, only to explain the proposed change and solicittenant reaction. This process avoids misunderstanding and tension. ThePHA and the tenants benefit from weeding out unworkable proposals. PHA comment approves removal of the old rule requirement to offer opportunityfor tenant comment on changes in the PHA lease form or PHA rules. The oldrule tenant comment requirement was an exercise in futility. Eliminationof the tenant comment requirement will allow the PHA to change the leaseor PHA rules more quickly. Lease changes are often required by HUD, andthe lease changes which are directed by HUD may not be modified in responseto tenant comment. PHA house rules and charges must be kept current withchanging circumstances. However, a PHA comment notes that the PHA intendsto continuing offering a 30 day opportunity for public comment, whetheror not required by HUD. The new rule does not retain the requirement to give the tenant an opportunityto comment on the PHA's adoption of a new lease form, or on changes inPHA schedules or rules. The degree and type of consultation with projectresidents is decided by the PHA, in the light of local circumstances. HUDdoes not have sufficient reason to impose a broad Federal requirement thatPHAs allow tenant comment on revisions in the PHA lease form, or in PHAschedules and rules. (Section 965.473(c) requires a PHA to allow tenantcomment before changing the PHA allowances for PHA-furnished and tenant-purchasedutilities.) It may be that giving tenants a full chance to comment and to be consultedon changes in PHA rules or lease forms is often good management practice,and may improve relations between the PHA and tenants. However, the nationalpublic housing rule does not seek to mandate all aspects of a presumedgood management practice. The rule leaves much to the discretion and goodmanagement judgment of the PHA, in the spirit of the statutory objectiveof allowing a PHA maximum local responsibility in administration of itsprograms (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 2, 42 U.S.C. 1437). A procedurefor soliciting tenant comment on a new lease or PHA rule is most usefulif employed at the free volition of the PHA, and not for compliance witha Federal requirement. Some comment asserts that elimination of tenant comment requirements isinconsistent with Federal statutory requirements for tenant participationin subsidized housing. Section 202 of the Housing and Community DevelopmentAmendments of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-557, October 1, 1978, 12 U.S.C. 1715z-1b)provides that tenants in certain HUD-subsidized multifamily projects musthave an opportunity to comment on requests by a project owner to HUD forapproval of certain procedures (such as the owner's request for a rentincrease). This statute does not apply to public housing. For the programscovered by section 202, the statute does not require opportunity for tenantparticipation concerning a change in the lease form or project rules. Comment suggests that the removal of tenant comment procedures is somehowcontrary to the intent of Congress in section 6(c)(4)(C) of the U.S. HousingAct of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437d(c)(4)(C)). This law provides that a PHA mustcomply with procedures and requirements prescribed by HUD for sound managementof public housing projects, including establishment of effective tenant-managementrelationships designed to assure satisfactory standards of tenant securityand project maintenance. The law does not require that tenant must be givenopportunity to comment on the PHA lease form or PHA rules. Comment also cites section 3(c)(2) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42U.S.C. 1437a(c)(2)), which defines the term ``operation'', as used in referenceto public housing in the 1937 Act. Under the Act, HUD may pay operatingsubsidy for ``operation'' of a public housing project. In section 3(c)(2)of the 1937 Act, the term ``operation'' is defined to include financingof tenant services, particularly where the tenants participate in developmentand operation of the services. This means that HUD operating subsidy mayto used to finance tenant services. However, the statute does not mandatetenant participation in project management, and does not require that publichousing tenants must be given an opportunity to comment on decisions ofPHA management, including development of a new lease form or PHA rules.Comment claims that elimination of the tenant comment requirement is inconsistentwith HUD's rule concerning tenant participation and management in publichousing projects (51 FR 44055, December 8, 1986). However, that rule doesnot require tenant participation in management of public housing, or inthe development of the tenant lease or PHA rules. Instead, the form andextent of tenant participation is a local decision, which is made by aPHA after consultation with its tenants (24 CFR 964.9). The PHA must consultwith the tenants, to ascertain if the tenants want to participate in projectmanagement, and to determine mutually-agreeable methods of tenant participation.In the consultation, the tenants may propose tenant participation in thedevelopment of the lease form or PHA rules, which might include the opportunityfor tenant comment on a proposed lease or proposed rule. However, underthe lease and grievance rule or the tenant participation rule, the natureand form of consultation between the tenants and the PHA is for local determinationby the PHA. Finally, comment suggests that tenants have a due process right to commenton a proposed lease form or PHA rules. It is true that the tenant has apractical interest in the terms of a PHA lease form or PHA rules. The leaseand PHA rules affect administration of the project in which the tenantlives, and also establish rights and duties of the tenant. In the caseof the lease, the tenant is bound by terms of the PHA lease form when thetenant executes a lease on that form. The tenant is bound by PHA ruleswhen the rules are adopted by the PHA. Once the lease and rules are inplace, the lease and rules establish rights and duties of the tenant, andthose rights or duties may define property interests which are protectedby the Constitution. However, the tenant does not have a property right,and consequently does not have a due process protected interest, to participatein the original shaping of the lease or rule by the PHA. There is no propertyright to comment on the making of a PHA rule, or on development of theform of lease that will be offered for execution by the tenant. Q. Changes in Rent or PHA Rules <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Changes During Lease Term</ITAG>During the course of the lease term, a PHA has authority to make importantchanges which affect the tenant, by adopting new PHA rules, and also byrevising the tenants rent or utility allowances. For clarity and ease ofreference, provisions governing such PHA changes during the lease termare gathered in a new andSection; 966.10(n):<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) From time to time during the course of the lease, the PHA mayrevise the amount of Tenant Rent or of PHA allowances to the Tenant forPHA-furnished or Tenant-purchased utilities. The revised amounts are bindingon the Tenant.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) From time to time during the course of the lease, the PHA mayrevise PHA rules. The revised rules are binding on the Tenant.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Rent Increase</ITAG>PHA comment states that the tenant should not be allowed to delay rentincreases by delaying acceptance of a new lease. However, prompt implementationof a rent increase does not require offer and acceptance of a new leaseor lease amendment. The lease provides that the amount of tenant rent isdetermined by the PHA in accordance with HUD regulations and requirements.The PHA may change the amount of rent previously determined by the PHA(andSection; 966.10(c) and andSection; 966.10(n)(l)). The final rule also providesthat the PHA may revise the amount of PHA allowances to the tenant (forPHA-furnished or tenant-purchased utilities) (andSection; 966.10(d)(5) andandSection; 966.10(n)(1)). A rent change as determined by the PHA after annualor interim reexamination is not an amendment of the lease, but is a changein the rent amount in accordance with the terms of the existing lease.Rent changes are made by notice to the tenant, and do not require any changein the terms of the lease. Upon PHA notice of the new amounts, the revisedamounts are binding on the tenant.Although not required by this rule, the lease may state the current rentamount (and not merely the requirement for rent computation in accordancewith HUD requirements). Inclusion of the actual amount may be requiredby State law, or may assist in enforcement of rent payment requirementsin the local landlord-tenant courts. If desired by the PHA, the lease mayprovide that the amount of rent stated in the lease may be revised by aPHA notice to tenant (which states the new rent amount), and that suchnotice constitutes an amendment of the lease.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. PHA Rules</ITAG>The proposed rule provides that the PHA rules must be available for inspectionby a family, but does not require the use of any particular procedure (postingor otherwise) for this purpose. Public comment states that the PHA shouldbe required to post the rules, or furnish the rules to the tenant. A tenantmust have notice of PHA rules so that the tenant can comply. The tenantshould be given a copy of the rules. Unless PHA rules are furnished tothe tenant, the rules may be unenforceable. However, other comment statesthat posting of rules is not necessary.The final rule provides that the tenant must comply with ``necessary andreasonable PHA rules, on conduct of Household members, or on use and treatmentof the unit and premises by the Tenant and Household'' (andSection; 966.10(h)(2)(iv)).The final rule requires the PHA to give the tenant a copy of these PHArules_including any changes in the rules. The purpose of this requirementis to give the tenant fair notice of the rules with which the tenant mustcomply.R. Offer of Lease or Revision<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Offer and Acceptance</ITAG>A public housing tenancy continues indefinitely until terminated for cause.During the term of an ongoing lease, the PHA may need to revise the leaseterms, or to enter a new lease with the tenant. For example, the PHA maywant to incorporate new lease provisions because of a change in State statutes,or because of new court decisions.The lease is a contract between the tenant and the PHA. The lease may onlybe revised by the tenant's agreement to be bound by new lease provisions.The rule (andSection; 966.10(o)2)) states that ``the Tenant is not boundby a new lease or lease revision unless the PHA's offer is accepted bythe Tenant''. Thus a revision of the lease is not accomplished by unilaterialact of the PHA, or without assent of the tenant. By contrast, the PHA hasunilateral authority to revise PHA rules or the tenant rent, and theserevisions do not require assent of the tenant (see andSection; 966.10(n)of the rule, and section III.Q of this Preamble).Comment states that in California a landlord may give notice of new leaseterms. If the tenant remains in possession for 30 days, the tenant is deemedto have accepted the new terms offered by the owner. Under the HUD rule,a new lease is not binding unless accepted by the tenant. Moreover, therule provides that the PHA's offer of a new lease or lease revision muststate how to accept the PHA offer (andSection; 966.10(o)(3)). However, theHUD rule does not seek to define what constitutes an offer and acceptance,thus forming a binding contract between the PHA and the tenant. The HUDrule leaves this question to the general law of offer and acceptance, asdetermined by State statute or common law.Comment states that tenant acceptance of a new lease should be assumed.The tenant should have the burden of refusing the offer. This recommendationis not adopted. HUD acknowledges that the content of the lease is not ordinarilydetermined by individual negotiation between the tenant and the PHA, andthat a tenant may sign the lease without much understanding of what thedocument means. HUD acknowledges also that the procedure proposed by thiscomment may be convenient for both the PHA and the tenant, and avoids therisk that the tenancy may be terminated for tenant's failure to acceptthe PHA offer by the PHA deadline. However, the public housing lease isan important contractual undertaking by the tenant, and should be the productof a positive act of acceptance in accordance with State law and the PHAoffer, not simply the product of tenant's failure to submit a formal refusalof the offer of a new lease.Comment advises that the requirement for a tenant to execute a new leasein accordance with this rule should not apply to modifications of the leaseprovisions which were previously required by HUD under the old rule. However,the Department does not have the power to unilaterally bind the tenantcontractually to new or different lease provisions. To change a lease executedunder the old rule, the tenant has to agree to the new lease terms. (HUDhas, however, power to establish new regulatory or other requirements,e.g., respecting tenant rent, which affect the tenant's occupancy underan existing lease.)<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Timely Acceptance</ITAG>The final rule states (andSection; 966.10(o)(3)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The offer of a new lease or lease revision shall state that failureto timely accept the PHA's offer is grounds for termination of tenancy.The offer shall state how to accept the offer. The offer may state thatthe Tenant must accept the lease by a PHA-established deadline which isstated in the offer. Failure to timely accept the PHA offer shall be ``othergood cause'' for termination of tenancy.</ITAG>The rule provides that tenant's failure to ``timely accept'' the PHA offerof a new lease or revision is grounds for termination. Comment states thatthe rule should specify what period is ``timely'', and states that theperiod for tenant acceptance should be short (five working days or twoweeks).The final rule does not set a uniform period for acceptance of the PHAlease. HUD agrees, however, that the PHA should be able to fix a definitedeadline for the tenant to accept the new lease. For orderly and uniformadministration of the transition to a new lease form, and for prompt implementationof the new lease provisions, the PHA should be able to set a date certainfor return of the executed lease. The PHA needs to know when the deadlinehas expired, and the PHA may proceed to terminate the tenancy for failureto accept the new lease. The imposition of a clear deadline will also helpthe PHA push for prompt return of the executed lease by a tenant.The final rule is revised to state that the PHA has the right to establisha deadline for the tenant to accept the offer of a new lease (andSection;966.10(o)(3)).The tenant does not have a right to postpone lease acceptance beyond thePHA established deadline. Late acceptance of the lease by a tenant doesnot remove the grounds for termination of tenancy.Comment states that if failure to accept a new lease is good cause fortermination of tenancy, this should be stated in the PHA's written offer.HUD agrees. The tenant should know what will happen if the tenant doesnot return the executed lease in time. Clear notice to the tenant willalso tend to help produce the desired result_prompt return of the executedlease by the tenant. The final rule provides that the PHA's offer muststate that failure of timely acceptance is grounds for termination of tenancy(andSection;966.10(o)(3)).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Failure to Accept is Grounds for Termination of Tenancy</ITAG>As leverage to induce a public housing tenant to accept lease changes profferedby PHA, the PHA must have the right to terminate the tenancy if the tenantdeclines to accept the offered changes. The old rule does not explicitlystate that the PHA may offer a new lease to the tenant, and that failureto sign a new lease is good cause for termination of tenancy. The new ruleprovides that the PHA may offer the tenant a new lease or revision of thelease (andSection;966.10(o)(1)), and that failure to timely accept the PHAoffer shall be ``other good cause'' for termination of tenancy (andSection;966.10(o)(3)).PHA comment strongly supports clarification that non-acceptance of thePHA offer of a new lease is ground for termination of tenancy. Many tenantsdo not sign new leases. The failure to sign a new lease is an administrativeburden for the PHA.Comment criticizes the provision that the tenant's failure to return thenew lease in time ``shall'' be good cause for eviction. Comment claimsthat in some situations failure to return the new lease is excusable. Therule should recognize that failure to return the lease ``may'' be groundfor termination. The PHA should have flexibility to decide whether thetenant will be evicted.Such comment is based on a misunderstanding of the new provision. If thetenant does not accept the lease offered by the PHA, the PHA has legalgrounds to evict. However, a PHA does not have to terminate tenancy inevery instance where there is legal good cause for termination. The determinationto terminate tenancy and evict the tenant is not automatic. The PHA hasmanagerial discretion to consider special circumstances of the individualcase, and to decide whether to evict the tenant. In practice, most PHAswill be loath to evict for minor or excusable delay in accepting the PHAoffer of a lease. The authority for termination of tenancy where the tenantfails to accept the PHA offer of a new lease or revision will probablybe chiefly used as a stimulus for prompt return of executed leases.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. When Offered</ITAG>The proposed rule provides that the PHA must give written notice of theoffer of a new lease or revision at least <T3>thirty </T3>days before the proposed date when the new provisions willbe effective. Under the final rule, there is no requirement for specificminimum notice before the proposed effective date. (But see section III.Tof Preamble, concerning required notice at the end of a fixed term lease.)Since the new lease does not go into effect without acceptance by the tenant,a specified minimum notice is not necessary. The PHA can work out the mechanicsof scheduling offer and acceptance of a new lease before a desired effectivedate.S. Term of Lease_Fixed Term or Periodic TenancyComment states that the new rule requires the PHA to lease the unit fora fixed term, rather than for a lease term which continues indefinitelyuntil terminated for cause. Comment states that the rule should retainleases that renew automatically each month until terminated for cause.The use of fixed term leases causes unnecessary paperwork and administrativeburden in order to renew the lease at the end of the fixed term.In reality, the proposed rule did not require or encourage the use of fixedterm leases. Under the new rule, as under the old, the PHA has a choicewhether to enter a lease for a periodic tenancy (month-to-month or otherinterval chosen by the PHA), or for a fixed term. Both options are equallyavailable to the PHA under the old rule or the new. HUD did not proposeany change in this system, and no such change is included in this finalrule. Under either form of lease, the public housing tenancy continuesindefinitely until terminated for cause (see U.S. Housing Act of 1937,section 6(l)(4), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(4); andSection;966.21).The old rule provides that a PHA may not ``terminate or <T3>refuse to renew </T3>the lease'' other than for cause. Thus, if a PHAchooses to use a fixed term lease, the PHA is required to renew the leaseunless there is good cause for termination of tenancy. Similarly, underthe new rule the PHA may not terminate the tenancy except for good causegrounds (andSection;966.21). The phrase ``termination of tenancy'' is defined(andSection;966.2) as termination of the tenant's ``legal right to occupancyof the dwelling unit'', including ``a decision not to renew the lease atthe end of the lease term''.Comment notes that HUD has eliminated authority for use of fixed leaseterms in the section 8 certificate program (as well as the section 8 voucherprogram) because of the problems of fixed term leases. In substance, thecomment asks why the same logic does not support elimination of fixed termleases in public housing. It is true that in public housing, as in thecertificate program, the assisted tenancy continues indefinitely unlessterminated for cause. There is, however, a central structural distinctionbetween the programs. In the section 8 program, the flow of housing assistancepayments to the owner can only continue so long as there is a lease. Wherethere is a fixed term lease, the section 8 assistance payments immediatelyterminate at the end of the fixed lease term if a new lease (and assistancecontract) is not entered (see Preamble section VIII.A in 49 FR 12215, 12231-12232,March 29, 1984). In public housing, there is no parallel problem of assuringthat the flow of Federal subsidy, and consequently assisted occupancy bythe tenant, is not interrupted on termination of a fixed term lease. Inthe public housing program, the PHA is the owner of the dwelling unit.If the PHA has not entered a new lease, the tenant may continue to livein the unit unless the tenancy is terminated for cause. There is no interruptionof subsidy or of the assisted occupancy. The PHA may only evict the tenanton a showing of good cause.HUD has not surveyed the extent to which PHAs use fixed term leases orperiodic leases. It is HUD's impression that most PHAs do not use fixedterm leases, but use leases that renew periodically unless terminated forcause. As stated in public comment on this rule, use of periodic leasesreduces the administrative burden of the PHA, since the existing leasesextend automatically until there is a particular reason for changing thelease. As under the old rule, the choice whether to use a fixed term ora periodic lease is best left to the PHA, since the PHA can weigh the additionaladministrative burdens of a fixed term lease, and any other factors supportinguse of either form of tenancy. In making the decision, the PHA may be influencedby procedural or substantive incidents of the tenancy under State law.Because comment exhibits considerable confusion on the type of tenancywhich is allowed by the new rule, the final rule adds a new provision toclarify that the PHA has the choice of a fixed term or periodic tenancy.The rule now provides (andSection; 966.10(b)(2)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The term of the lease may be for a fixed term tenancy or for a periodictenancy (e.g., month-to-month). In either case, the PHA shall not terminatethe tenancy except in accordance with [HUD requirements].</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The PHA may only evict the family on a showing of good cause.T. Fixed Term Lease_Notice at End of Lease termA PHA may use a fixed term lease or a periodic lease. In the case of afixed term lease, the lease does not extend automatically. At the end ofthe stated lease term, the lease ends unless the PHA and tenant enter intoa new lease.The final rule adds a new provision which requires notice to the tenantbefore the end of a fixed term lease (andSection;966.10(o)(4)). At the endof a fixed term lease, the tenant loses the tenure and occupancy protectionsprovided by the lease. The end of a fixed term lease is a major changein the legal occupancy rights of the former tenant. For this reason, theconcept of termination of tenancy is specifically defined to include ``adecision not to renew the lease at the end of the lease term'' (andSection;966.2).The PHA must have good cause grounds for termination of tenancy (seriousor repeated lease violation or other good cause) (andSection;996.21).For protection of the tenant at the end of a fixed term lease, the ruleprovides that at least sixty days before the end of the fixed lease term,the PHA must either offer the tenant a lease renewal (on the same or revisedterms), or must notify the tenant that the PHA has decided not to renewthe lease (including a statement of the good cause grounds for not renewingthe lease).The rule (andSection;966.10(o)(4)) provides that:<ITAG tagnum="21">at least 60 days before the end of the [fixed] lease term, the PHAshall give written notice to the tenant containing either:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) the offer of renewal (on the same or revised terms), or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) notice that the PHA has decided not to renew the lease, includinga statement of the [good cause] grounds * * *  for not renewing the lease.</ITAG>As the end of the fixed term approaches, the tenant needs to know if thePHA intends to renew the lease, or intends to refuse a renewal on appropriategood cause grounds. Statutory and regulatory requirements for notice oflease termination do not apply, since the natural end of the fixed leaseterm is not a termination of the lease. The sixty day notice required bythis rule informs the tenant whether the PHA intends to renew the leaseat the end of the fixed term, or to terminate the tenancy for cause. Ifthe PHA has decided to terminate the tenancy, the tenant can prepare toleave the unit, or to contest the grounds for termination.The sixty day notice requirement only applies at the end of a fixed termlease, but does not apply to a periodic tenancy_which renews automaticallyunless terminated for cause (such as a periodic tenancy from month-to-monthor year to year). In the case of a periodic tenancy, the leasehold willcontinue indefinitely unless the PHA gives notice of lease termination(see andSection;966.22), or gives notice that the PHA is offering a new leaseor revision (see andSection;966.10(o)). By contrast, a fixed term lease expiresautomatically at the end of the predetermined fixed term, and the rulerequires sixty day notice so that the tenant will know what will happenat the end of the fixed term, and can take appropriate action.Comment recommends that the PHA be required to state good cause groundsfor refusal to renew a fixed term lease at the end of the lease term. Thisrecommendation is adopted.U. Transition_Applicability of New Lease RequirementsThe rule provides that the new regulatory lease requirements are applicableto any lease which is executed by a tenant after the effective date ofthe rule, including the execution of a revision or extension after thatdate (andSection;966.12). The new lease requirements do not automaticallyapply to preexisting leases, but become applicable by the positive contractualaction of the tenant in executing a new lease, a lease revision, or a leaseextension offered by the PHA.New lease requirements apply to all leases executed after the rule is effective.However, there is no requirement to terminate existing leases wholesale,or to execute new leases by a HUD-imposed regulatory deadline. The PHAis permitted to phase in the use of the new regulatory lease requirementsby determining when tenants execute new lease documents. The PHA may scheduleexecution of leases and lease revisions in accordance with prior PHA practice,or other PHA policy on conversion to use of new leases. Under the new rule,the PHA will have considerable freedom in working out timing of a processto convert existing leases to new leases developed under the new rule.The PHA is free to pick an appropriate period or point in time for executionof new leases, and thus for conversion of existing leases to requirementsof the new rule.PHA comment expresses a preference for conversion at the next reexaminationof a tenant, to avoid the administrative burden of operating for a periodunder different lease forms. HUD agrees that the regular annual reexaminationmay be a convenient conversion point. The offer of a new lease may be handledat the same time as other communications with tenant in connection withthe reexamination. If tenant reexamination dates are staggered throughthe PHA fiscal year (to even out the workload of processing reexaminations),the use of the annual reexamination as the point of conversion would havethe effect of staggering the lease conversion through the PHA fiscal year.During this period, the PHA will have some tenants on the old lease form,and some on the new. Alternatively, the PHA may choose to set a singledate for conversion of the whole PHA program, to diminish the period ofoverlap between use of old and new lease forms.The speed and form of the conversion process is affected by the terms ofexisting leases, as well as by procedural and substantive requirementsunder State law. The conversion process must be consistent with contractualrights of tenants under existing leases. Many PHAs use month-to-month periodicleases, which extend automatically until the leases are terminated forcause. It appears that in general a lease may be readily and rapidly convertedby offering a new lease, and giving thirty day notice that the old leaseis terminated in order to permit conversion to the new lease.Legal aid comment states that PHAs should be allowed to retain currentleases developed for use under the old rule. HUD notes that the new ruledoes not grandfather lease forms developed under the old rule. All newleases must comply with the new rule. However, few changes will be necessary.Most regulatory changes from the old lease rule remove or relieve leaserequirements which are too detailed, or which overly constrain the managerialdiscretion of the PHA. Therefore, most provisions which satisfied the requirementsof the old rule will also satisfy requirements of the new rule. The PHAmay elect to continue use of the old lease form, after making those fewmodifications necessary to comply with the new rule.The old rule provided that the PHA grievance procedure must be incorporatedin the PHA dwelling lease (old rule andSection;966.50). Therefore changesin the scope and shape of the old PHA grievance procedure pursuant to thisrule (see Part V and Part VI of this Preamble) should be accompanied bycorresponding revisions in the grievance requirements incorporated in thePHA dwelling lease form, or by removing the grievance procedure from thelease form. The new rule does not require incorporation of the PHA grievanceprocedure in the tenant lease.Because the grievance procedure was incorporated in the old lease, thePHA may have to revise existing leases in order to implement changes inthe grievance procedure. Under the old lease, the tenant has a contractualright to use the grievance procedure stated in the lease. These contractualrights of the tenant under the existing lease may therefore prevent thePHA from making changes in the grievance process with respect to the tenant(for example, excluding termination of tenancy and eviction from the PHAgrievance procedure). The right of an existing tenant to use the old grievanceprocedure under an existing lease depends on the particular contractuallanguage by which the grievance procedure was incorporated in the lease.For example, a simple incorporation by reference which binds the PHA touse the current PHA grievance procedure does not freeze the grievance procedurein effect at the time of lease execution, but will accommodate the grievanceprocedure changes which are authorized under this rule. In any event, executionof a new lease will wipe out any rights to use of the old grievance procedureas incorporated in the old lease.V. Turnkey III and Indian Housing_Lease Requirements<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Turnkey III and Mutual Help</ITAG>In the Turnkey III and Mutual Help homeownership opportunity programs,PHAs are required to use the forms of homeownership agreement prescribedby HUD. In each program the agreement with the homebuyer is a long-termlease with option to purchase (for a term of 25 or 30 years). The formagreement does not contain any of the unreasonable provisions prohibitedfor the HUD housing subsidy programs, or any other provisions deemed unreasonableby the Department. Thus, no new regulatory action is necessary for compliancewith the prohibition of unreasonable lease provisions in the 1983 law.Under the 1983 law, a PHA must give adequate written notice of lease termination,for a minimum period specified in the law (42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(3)). HUD-prescribedform homeownership agreements require adequate 30 day notice if a homeownershipagreement is terminated by the PHA for breach of the agreement by the homebuyer(Turnkey III and Mutual Help), or for loss of homeownership potential (TurnkeyIII) (see andSection; 904.107(m) and (o), and 905.424(b) of the present rules).These existing notice procedures satify the statutory requirements fornotice of lease termination under the 1983 law. The Turnkey III and Mutual Help agreements also provide that the PHA mayterminate an agreement if there is no qualified successor (on death, mentalincapacity or abandonment by the homebuyer) (andSection; 904.107(l)(3) and905.425(g)). However, the existing regulations do not explicitly requirenotice of termination on this ground. The regulations are therefore amendedto require adequate written notice of termination in compliance with the1983 law. For consistency with the other termination provisions in theTurnkey III and Mutual Help regulations, the rule requires 30 days noticeof termination if there is no qualified successor to the homebuyer. The Turnkey III and Mutual Help regulations and forms of homeownershipagreement provide (andSection; 904.107(m)(l) and 905.424(a)) that the PHAmay terminate the homebuyer agreement if the homebuyer violates the agreement.To accord with the statutory standard for termination of tenancy underthe 1983 law (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(l)(4), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(4)),this rule amends the regulations for these homeownership programs to specifythat the homeownership agreement may be terminated for<T3> ``serious or repeated</T3> violation'' of the agreement.The Turnkey III and Mutual Help homebuyer agreements may also be terminatedif there is no qualified successor (andSection; 904.107(1)(3) and 905.425(g)),or (in Turnkey III) if the homebuyer has lost homeownership potential (andSection;904.107(o)). Both of these grounds for termination are comprised in theconcept of ``other good cause'' for termination of tenancy, and no amendmentis necessary for compliance with the standards for termination of tenancyin the 1983 law. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Indian Rental Projects </ITAG>Historically, Indian housing rental projects have not been covered by regulatorylease requirements for non-Indian rental projects (Part 966), nor are suchrequirements contained in the Indian Housing regulation (see Part 905,Subpart C). The new statutory lease requirements must be implemented forthe Indian housing rental program. This rule requires full compliance with the statutory lease requirementsenacted in 1983 (42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)), but does not require use of the moreelaborate set of regulatory lease requirements imposed by HUD under the1983 law for non-Indian rental projects. The rule provides (andSection; 905.303)that a written lease shall be entered between the Indian Housing Authority(IHA) and the tenant of a rental unit. The lease must: <ITAG tagnum="15">_Obligate the IHA to maintain the project in a decent, safe and sanitaryconditon. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Require the IHA to give adequate written notice of termination ofthe lease in accordance with the requirements (andSection; 966.22) for non-Indianprojects. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Require that the IHA may not terminate the tenancy except for thestatutory good cause grounds (andSection; 966.21). </ITAG>The lease may not include any of the lease provisions prohibited by HUD(section 966.11). <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Termination of Tenancy </ITAG>A. Grounds <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Statute and Rule </ITAG>Under section 6(l)(4) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437(l)(4)),the lease must require that the PHA may not terminate the tenancy ``exceptfor serious or repeated violation of the terms or conditions of the leaseor for other good cause.'' This statement of the grounds for terminationof tenancy was added in the 1983 law. Under the rule (andSection; 966.21(a)), a housing lease must require that:<ITAG tagnum="21">``The PHA shall not terminate the tenancy, and shall not evict occupantsfrom the dwelling unit, except for (1) serious or repeated violation ofthe lease, or (2) other good cause.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Other Good Cause </ITAG><T3>a. When PHA May Terminate for Other Good Cause. </T3>Comment recommendsthat the PHA should be required to give advance notice of family behaviorwhich will <T3>in the future </T3>be good cause for termination of tenancy, as inthe current regulations for some of the project-based HUD subsidy programs.The comment states that a tenant should not be threatened with evictionfor grounds which are not foreseeable. The tenant should be given thirtydays notice that specified future conduct and action will be ``other goodcause'' for termination of tenancy.This recommendation is not adopted. The PHA should be able to respond immediatelyto family behavior which justifies a termination of tenancy, and shouldnot have to wait for a repetition of the behavior. Types of undesirablefamily behavior which are anticipated by the PHA are ordinarily prohibitedin the lease or in PHA rules. The statutory category of ``other good cause''is most usefully applied to permit a termination of tenancy for groundsnot readily foreseeable by the PHA.Comment states that there should be a more explicit regulatory definitionof ``other good cause'', and that good cause should be explicitly definedin the lease. Comment complains that PHAs may use other good cause as acatch-all category that substantially negates good cause.HUD believes that the concept of other good cause should be left broadand flexible, as authorized by the statute, for application by PHAs andthe courts to a variety of facts and circumstances_including other goodcause related to the behavior or characteristics of the family, and othergood cause related to requirements for the PHA's management of the housing.Comment says other good cause should be limited to material violationswhich affect livability of the property, or tenant health or safety. Thesuggestion is not adopted. The proposed change would unduly constrict theuse of termination for other good cause.<T3>b. Termination At End of Lease Term. </T3>In the private rental market,a landlord may terminate the lease <T3>during the lease term </T3>if the tenant violates the lease. At theend of the lease term, the landlord may generally refuse to renew for anyreason or no reason (although this common law principle may be modifiedby state statute). In the public housing program, a tenancy continues indefinitelyuntil terminated for cause. At the end of a lease term (including a periodicor a fixed term), the PHA must renew unless there is good cause for refusingto renew. The public housing tenancy is open-ended, and the PHA thereforeneeds a flexible authority to terminate the tenancy at the end of the leaseterm, for reasons which may not have been expected or included in the lease.During the term of the lease, the PHA is bound by the lease with the tenant.Like any landlord, the PHA needs authority to evict a tenant who breachesa term of the lease. It is, however, less important that the PHA shouldhave the broad authority to evict <T3>during the lease term, </T3>for grounds other than violation of thelease by the tenant. The final rule is therefore revised to provide thatthe PHA may only terminate the lease for other good cause ``at the endof a lease term'' (andSection; 966.21(c)(1)).The rule also describes how this broad rule applies to a fixed term leaseor to a lease for a periodic tenancy (andSection; 966.21(c)(2)):<ITAG tagnum="21">A fixed term lease may be terminated for other good cause at the endof the fixed term. A lease for a periodic tenancy may be terminated forother good cause at the end of each periodic term. For example, in thecase of a month-to-month tenancy, the lease may be terminated for othergood cause at the end of each month.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">3. Violation of lease</ITAG><T3>a. Comment on Statutory Standard. </T3>Some comment asserts that thePHA should be permitted to terminate tenancy for any lease violation, notonly for a ``serious or repeated'' violation as provided under the 1983law. The standard for termination of tenancy will be subject to varyingjudicial interpretation, and will hinder ability of PHAs to evict. Commentsuggests that while any lease violation should be grounds for eviction,the tenant should have a reasonable time (not more than 30 days) to correctthe violation. Comment claims that the serious or repeated violation standardis useless and ambiguous.Provision that a PHA may only terminate tenancy for serious or repeatedviolation of the lease (and thus may not terminate for a lease violationwhich is not serious or repeated) is necessary to comply with the 1983law (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(l)(4), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(4)).The rule must follow the statutory standard.The concrete day-to-day operation of the statutory standard depends onhow the standard is applied by State landlord-tenant courts in individualcases. Under this rule, the Federal statutory standards for terminationof tenancy must be included in the public housing lease. Local landlord-tenantcourts will apply the Federal standards for termination of tenancy (asterms of the public housing lease) to the facts of individual cases. Acourt has recently noted that claims under the termination of tenancy andother lease provisions required by the 1983 law ``belong in local court''(<T3>Edwards v. D.C., </T3>821 F.2d 651, 653-54 n.2 (DC Cir. 1987)). Itis the sense of the Department that the ``serious or repeated'' violationstandard under the 1983 law is a reasonably workable basis for terminationof tenancy in the public housing program.<T3>b. What is a Serious or Repeated Violation? </T3>Comment states thatHUD should further define or give examples of what is a ``serious'' or``repeated'' violation of the lease.Under the lease, the PHA may evict for a single ``serious'' violation ofthe lease, even if the violation is not repeated. The rule does not attempta comprehensive definition of what types of violation are ``serious''.In general, application of this concept is best left to decisions by theState landlord-tenant court in individual cases.However, the rule clarifies that the PHA may treat several specific typesof lease violation by the tenant as a serious violation, and so as groundsfor termination of tenancy:(1) Failure to supply information or certification (andSection; 966.21(b)(1))(see discussion at section III.H.2 of Preamble).(2) Non-payment of rent or charges (andSection; 966.21(b)(2)) (see discussionat section III.G.5.b of Preamble).(3) Utility shut-off when tenant fails to pay utility bill (andSection; 966.10(d)(4)(ii))(see discussion at section III.G.5.e of Preamble).The rule states that the concept of serious lease violation ``includes,but is not limited to'' the three mentioned cases (andSection; 966.21(b)).Issues concerning termination of tenancy for non-payment of rent or charges,or for failure to provide income or other information, are of particularimportance to PHA management of the program. The payment of rent, and thesubmission of required information on family information and composition,are necessary to implement statutory requirements, and for sound managementof public housing projects. The rule provides that where the tenant failsto pay rent or charges, or fails to supply information required by thePHA, ``the PHA may determine'' that the failure is a ``serious'' violationof the lease (andSection; 966.21(b)). See discussion at section III.G.5.b(non-payment) and section III.H.2 (failure to provide information) of thisPreamble. These provisions are a contractual affirmation that the determinationto treat a lease violation as a serious violation warranting terminationof tenancy is vested in the first instance in the administrative judgmentof the PHA. The PHA has a contractual right to make the determination inaccordance with the lease.The final rule states that a utility shut-off because of tenant's failureto pay the utility bill is a serious lease violation. See discussion atsection III.G.5.e of this Preamble.The concept of ``repeated'' lease violation is usually easy to apply. Tenant'sobligations are stated in the lease. Any lease violations may be groundsfor termination if the violations are ``repeated''. It should be notedthat the lease does not provide that the tenancy may only be terminatedfor repeated violation of the same provision of the lease, or for repetitionof the same violation. Any set of repeated violations may be ground fortermination of tenancy.The old rule provides that the PHA may terminate the tenancy for seriousor repeated violation of ``material'' terms of the lease. Comment criticizeselimination of the provision that the violation must be of a ``material''term of the lease. Elimination broadens the base for eviction, and encouragesthe PHA to evict for minor infractions.The final rule follows the statute, and does not include the limitationto violation of ``material'' terms. All terms of the lease are part ofthe contractual arrangement between the PHA and the tenant. Tenant's violationof any lease may result in termination of tenancy if the violation is eitherserious or repeated. The limitation to serious or repeated violation isa sufficient safeguard against eviction for trivial or minor reasons. Theproposed restriction to ``material'' terms of the lease implies that thereare non-material terms. The tenant should not be encouraged to believethat there are any lease requirements which may be safely ignored. Thelease is a contract, and all provisions of the contract are binding. Theretention of the old ``material terms'' limitation may encourage judgesto reject eviction on subjective grounds, rather than to enforce the plainand literal requirements of the lease.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Grounds for Termination_Other Issues</ITAG><T3>a. PHA Discretion to Evict. </T3>Some comment states that the PHA shouldhave discretion in deciding whether to evict the family. HUD agrees thatthe decision to evict is a discretionary management decision by the PHA.The statute and rule establish minimum grounds for termination of tenancy.The PHA is not required to terminate tenancy and evict in every case wherethere is ground for termination of tenancy.<T3>b. Effect of Federal Rule on State Procedures. </T3>Comment statesthat the rule should require compliance with procedural protections fora tenant under State law, or should provide that State law controls wherethe Federal rule interferes with tenant protections under State law. Commentexpresses concern that the rule deprives a public housing tenant of rightsof a private tenant under State law. Other comment is concerned that theFederal rule may preempt State protections.At a minimum, tenants are entitled to all the protections afforded by Federallaw and this rule. State law may not override rights under Federal lawor regulation, but may give a tenant the right to additional protections.Federal statute and regulation governing lease rights and termination oftenancy in the public housing program is not a comprehensive scheme thatprecludes other State regulation concerning this subject. To the contrary,it is assumed that the procedural and substantive law affecting a tenancyin the public housing program is compounded of elements established byboth Federal and State law.State laws are binding without incorporation in a Federal rule, or in theFederally-required lease requirements. State tenant protections may beenforced through the State courts or other procedures available under Statelaw, without any need to create a Federal right to State law protections.<T3>B. Notice of Lease Termination</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Notice Period</ITAG>Section 6(l)(3) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(3)),which was added by the 1983 law, provides that a public housing PHA mustuse leases that require ``adequate written notice of termination of thelease'' by the PHA. The law prescribes minimum notice periods:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) a reasonable time, but not to exceed 30 days, when the healthor safety of other tenants or public housing agency employees is threatened;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) 14 days in the case of nonpayment of rent; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) 30 days in any other case * * *.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The statutory notice periods required by the 1983 law are essentiallythe same as under the old rule. The new rule requires a PHA to give noticeof lease termination in accordance with the 1983 law (andSection; 966.22(a)).The rule requires fourteen days notice in case of non-payment of rent.PHA comment states that HUD should not require written notice for non-paymentof rent. Comment from a tenant organization says that ten days is ample.In answer to these comments, HUD notes that the requirement for noticeof lease termination, and the fourteen day notice period for non-paymentof rent, are statutory. The notice may not be eliminated or shortened.The rule provides that if health or safety of tenants or employees is threatened,the notice period must be a ``reasonable time'' (andSection; 966.22(a)(1)).The statute and rule do not state any fixed minimum period for ``reasonable''notice. However, the PHA is never required to give more than thirty daysnotice.Comment recommends that the PHA should have to give notice for a minimumof ten days, but not more than thirty days. Comment requests further definitionof ``reasonable time'', and states that a reasonable time should neverexceed twenty-four hours.HUD acknowledges that the application of the statutory ``reasonable time''standard to particular cases may be a subject of dispute. The PHA has alegitimate need to know that the PHA's good faith judgment of what is areasonable time as applied to a concrete set of facts will be sustainedby the local landlord-tenant court. The PHA may be torn between the PHA'sperception of urgency, and uncertainty whether the PHA's perception, andconsequently the PHA's decision on what is a reasonable time, will be upheldby the local landlord-tenant court. If the court disagrees, the PHA maybe forced to re-trace procedural steps for eviction of the tenant, prolongingtime needed to evict the tenant and prolonging also the danger to tenantsor PHA employees.HUD has no basis for defining a fixed reasonable time, where the noticeperiod is less than thirty days. The determination of reasonableness shouldbe based on the facts of individual cases. HUD also believes that the ``reasonabletime'' standard is intended by the Congress to leave room for practicalseat-of-the-pants judgments by PHA officials. HUD should not impose anarbitrary national standard.However, the rule explicitly recognizes that the original judgment of whatis a reasonable time can only be exercised by the PHA, which is responsiblefor day-to-day management of the program. The final rule provides thatin health and safety cases notice of lease termination may not be lessthan ``a reasonable time, <T3>as determined by the PHA</T3> * * *.'' (andSection; 966.22(a)(1)). Inaddition, the final rule states that ``the PHA may establish a policy fordetermining what is a `reasonable' time in different types of cases'' <T3>(Id.). </T3>The PHA is responsible for determining what is a ``reasonabletime''.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Requirement for Adequate Notice </ITAG>In accordance with section 6(l)(3) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42U.S.C. 1437d(l)(3)), the rule provides that the PHA's notice of lease terminationmust give the tenant ``adequate written notice'' of a termination of thelease (andSection;966.22(a)). The rule also prohibits use of a lease provisionwhich would waive the statutory and regulatory requirement for adequatenotice of lease termination (andSection;966.11(d), see section III.L.3 ofPreamble). Comment states that the rule should specify that the PHA may only evictafter complying with HUD requirements for a lease termination notice. HUDbelieves that further rule language is not necessary for this purpose.The rule provides that the PHA must give notice of lease termination tothe tenant, and describes what is required for such notice. The lease,and therefore the tenant's right to occupancy under the lease, does notterminate unless the Federally required notice has been given. Consequently,the PHA may not evict until expiration of the required lease terminationnotice. Comment states that the requirement for ``adequate written notice'' istoo loose, and will result in inconsistent enforcement. However, the rulelists the principal elements which must be included in the lease terminationnotice andSection;966.22(b) on contents of termination notice), and alsostates the minimum notice periods required by the 1983 law. The rule willprovide adequate instruction to the PHA. The notice must ``contain a specific statement of the reasons for leasetermination'' (andSection;966.22(b)(3)). Comment states that the notice shouldprovide enough information so that the tenant can prepare a defense, andthat the notice should state the factual basis for the reasons, and thesource of the facts. A simple requirement to state the reasons for lease termination adequatelyconveys the need for an informative statement on the reasons why the PHAis terminating the lease. HUD will not burden the PHA with the need todraft elaborate pleadings setting forth factual and legal reasons for terminationof the lease. The Federal notice of lease termination does not replaceany pleadings or notices required in the State proceeding for evictionof the tenant. The State court eviction proceeding is subject to proceduralrequirements under State law, and to requirements for procedural due processunder the fourteenth amendment that allows the tenant adequate notice andopportunity to present a defense. Comment notes that the lease termination notice should state that the PHAcan only evict the tenant for good cause. This recommendation is adopted.Under the final rule the contents of the lease termination notice must:<ITAG tagnum="15">_State that the PHA may only terminate the tenancy for serious orrepeated violation of the lease, or other good cause'' (andSection;966.22(b)(2)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Contain a specific statement of the reasons for lease termination''(andSection;966.22(b)(3)). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_State that the PHA may only evict occupants from the dwelling unit(i) through a civil court proceeding in which the Tenant has the opportunityto present a defense, and (ii) after a decision by the court on the rightsof the parties'' (andSection;966.22(b)(4)). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">3. When Lease Terminates </ITAG>The October 1982 proposed rule (proposed andSection;866.13(b)(1)) providedthat a notice of termination of tenancy must state the ``date the tenancyshall terminate''. A technical comment noted that under termination procedurein some States the actual date of lease termination is not or cannot beknown at the time the PHA gives the HUD-required termination notice. Thismay occur, for example, because the date of lease termination depends onfuture events (such as actions by the local landlord tenant court aftercommencement of the eviction proceeding) whose dates are not known by thePHA at the time the PHA gives notice to the tenant. In response to thiscomment, the rule provides that the notice of lease termination must state``when'' the lease will terminate (andSection;966.22(b)(1)). If the dateof lease termination is not known, the notice may state ``the event bywhich the lease terminates under local procedures''. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Relation to Notices Under State Law </ITAG>The 1983 law does not describe the relationship between notice proceduresunder State and local law, and the notice of lease termination requiredby Federal law. The rule provides (andSection;966.22(d)(1)) that:<ITAG tagnum="21">``A notice to vacate or other notice under State or local law maybe combined with, or run concurrently with, the notice of lease termination* * * * However, the lease shall in no event terminate before expirationof [the minimum lease terminatice notice periods under the Federal statuteand this rule].''</ITAG>Under the old lease and grievance rule, courts held that the PHA may onlyserve a State notice to quit after satisfaction of the lease terminationnotice required by the Federal rule. Under the 1983 law and the new rule,the Federal minimum notice period and any State notice periods may be runat the same time. The new rule provides that the State and Federal notices``may run concurrently''. The rule also provides that although the Federaland State notices may be combined, the lease does not terminate beforethe end of the federally required notice of lease termination. As recommendedby comment, the rule provides that the HUD mandated notice may actuallybe ``combined with'' any notice under State or local law. Comment endorses the change to permit concurrent running of State and Federalnotice. The added time for sequential running of the Federal and Statenotices, as required by the courts under the old rule, is not necessaryfor the tenant to prepare a defense or rectify violation. The PHA shouldfile in State court immediately on completion of the HUD-required notice.Delay in commencement of State proceedings causes loss of PHA income, andincrease in tenant abuse. The National Association of Housing and RedevelopmentOfficials (NAHRO) comments that the prior requirement for completion offourteen days notice for nonpayment of the rent before the PHA could initiateState and local notice procedures created tremendous delays in removingresidents. NAHRO states that the new rule provides PHAs much needed reliefand control in carrying out eviction more expeditiously. Comment claims that a provision for concurrent running of State and Federalnotices is contrary to law. However, it is the view of the Department thatthe notice procedures under the rule comply literally and completely withapplicable Federal statutory requirements, and with the requirements ofprocedural due process as enunciated by the Supreme Court. Unless HUD determinesthat State and local law require that a tenant have the opportunity fora fair hearing in court before eviction from the unit, no family may beevicted until the tenant has the opportunity for a PHA grievance hearing.This rule seeks to avoid establishment of Federally imposed terminationprocedures which are not required by Federal law, and which will impedeprompt processing of evictions by the PHA. Factors which lengthen the evictionprocess increase administrative burdens on the PHA, interfere with enforcementof contract requirements against the tenant, result in financial loss tothe PHA (for example, by increasing the PHA collection loss), and are harmfulto management of the project (for example by prolonging the period foreviction of a family which disturbs other residents or which damages theunit). HUD believes that the explicit authorization in this rule for concurrentrunning of State and Federal notices will contribute to efficient and effectivemanagement of public housing for the benefit of the residents. Comment states that if State and Federal notices run concurrently, thePHA will not negotiate in good faith with the tenant. HUD believes thatexcessive built-in procedural delays in the eviction process undercut theincentive of the tenant to pay the rent and comply with other requirementsof the lease. Thus the pyramiding of the Federal and State notice periods,pursuant to judicial construction of the old rule, probably tended to weakenthe incentive of the tenant to negotiate in good faith for payment of backrent or correction of family behavior. Comment says that allowing the PHA to combine the Federal and State noticeswill be confusing to the tenant. HUD is acutely aware that the existenceof separate Federal and State notice procedures, as well as other separateFederal and State requirements for termination of tenancy, may result insome confusion. At the level of each individual PHA, the uniform nationallease termination notice, which is required to implement the 1983 Federallaw, interacts with different State procedures and requirements for terminationof tenancy. For this reason, the Federal notice requirement will operatein different ways in different localities. Although the public housinglease termination notice is the same for all PHAs, the mean period foreviction of a public housing tenant will differ for different PHAs becauseof differences in local law and local courts. In 1982 HUD proposed to eliminate Federally mandated minimum periods fortermination of a public housing lease, thus eliminating confusion resultingfrom the overlay of Federal notice requirements on top of existing Statenotice procedures. Because of the 1983 law, elimination of the Federalnotice periods is no longer an option. In this context, the rule is designedto permit the PHA to discover the best possible way to integrate Federaland State notice procedures. The rule therefore seeks to avoid unnecessaryor over-elaborate Federal regulatory requirements that will complicateor unreasonably delay the eviction of a family. Where Federal and State notices run concurrently, or are combined, thePHA must nevertheless comply with requirements of each regulatory scheme_andtherefore the policies reflected in Federal and State notice requirements.Sequential stacking of Federal and State notices distorts the policy behindthe separate notices, by forcing the PHA to give a longer notice than intendedby either Federal or State law. For example, under the 1983 law and thisrule, the PHA must give fourteen days notice for nonpayment of rent. Thisperiod reflects a legislative judgment that this period is adequate noticein non-payment cases.Similarly, under the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, the landlordmay terminate a rental agreement after fourteen days written notice (UniformAct, andSection; 4.201). This period may be presumed to reflect a similarlegislative judgment. If a PHA is forced to run the Federal and State terminationnotices consecutively (rather than concurrently), the tenant receives notfourteen days notice, as contemplated by each separate legislation, buttwenty-eight days aggregate notice, double the period contemplated by Stateor Federal law. Conversely, the concurrent running of State and Federalnotices permits full satisfaction of notice requirements under both Stateand Federal law. Comment objects to requiring fourteen days notice before filing a State``warrant for non-payment''. The rule does not instruct the PHA when tofile or serve any document required by State law or procedure for evictionof a family. State process is wholly an artifact of State law, and maybe issued at any time allowed by the State law. The rule does, however,remove any Federal impediment to filing or serving the State process atthe earliest time allowed by the State law. If State process may not be issued until the lease has been terminated,then the issuance of State process may be delayed by notice periods requiredby the Federal statute and this rule. For example, if State process fornon-payment cannot be issued until the lease has terminated, the PHA mustwait until the end of the fourteen day Federal notice period for non-paymentof rent. Since the lease termination notice periods are statutory, HUDhas no power to shorten or eliminate the required notice periods underthe 1983 law.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Relation to PHA Rent Bill </ITAG>A PHA suggests that to avoid delays in lease termination for non-paymentof rent, the monthly rent statement should include a notice that the leasewill terminate on a stated day if rent is not paid in accordance with thelease. This procedure would satisfy the lease termination notice requirement,as well as the PHA problems in collection of rent. The PHA recommendation is adopted. The regulation provisions concerningnotice of lease termination are amended to add new provisions which allowthe PHA to give notice with the regular monthly rent bill that the leasewill be terminated if tenant does not pay the rent bill on time. The revisedrule provides (andSection; 966.22(d)(2)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The PHA rent bill may be combined with a notice of lease terminationfor nonpayment of rent. The notice of lease termination shall state thatthe lease will terminate if the rent bill is not paid when due.</ITAG>The notice must be in accordance with all requirements for a notice oflease termination (andSection; 966.22), including the requirement for fourteendays notice of termination for nonpayment of rent (andSection; 966.22(a)(2)),and requirements concerning contents of a lease termination notice (andSection;966.22(b)). The lease termination notice must be served in accordance withthe requirements for service of a lease termination notice (andSection; 966.10(l)(2)(ii)).If the termination of tenancy is not excluded from the PHA grievance process,the PHA must also give notice of adverse action (in accordance with andSection;966.31(b)(2)(i)(B)). If the PHA elects to give notice of lease terminationtogether with the monthly rent bill, the period of the 14 day lease terminationnotice runs from the date the notice is given.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Relation to Notice of Proposed Adverse Action </ITAG>A proposed decision to terminate the tenancy is an adverse action by thePHA (andSection; 966.31(a)(2)(i)). Lease termination is included in the regulatorydefinition of termination of tenancy (andSection; 966.2). Upon timely request,a tenant has the statutory right to a grievance hearing on a proposed leasetermination (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(k)(2), 42 U.S.C. 1437(k)(2))(unless the PHA has elected to exclude the grievance from the administrativegrievance procedure; see section VI of this Preamble). The PHA must notify the tenant of the opportunity for a hearing on theproposed lease termination, by giving notice of proposed adverse actionbefore or combined with the statutory notice of lease termination (andSection;966.22(d)(3) and andSection; 966.31(b)(2)(i)(B)). The tenant must be giventhe opportunity for a hearing before expiration of the applicable leasetermination notice period. If the tenant makes a timely request for a hearing,the lease does not terminate, and the occupants may not be evicted fromthe unit before completion of the PHA grievance hearing (andSection; 966.31(e)(1)).A comment generally agrees with these requirements, but is concerned thatthe tenant may be able to delay eviction by delaying the grievance hearing.HUD agrees that there is some potential for deliberate tenant-caused delay,and that such delay could hold up eviction. However, the PHA grievanceprocedure should be designed for prompt scheduling and completion of hearings(see andSection; 966.32(f)). The PHA can structure the hearing process tominimize or avoid unnecessary tenant-caused delay. The PHA grievance procedure may establish deadlines for submission of tenantgrievance requests (andSection; 966.31(c)(2)). The grievance officer hasauthority to regulate conduct of the hearing, including the power to proceedpromptly with the hearing (andSection; 966.32(c)). The hearing officer hasample authority to control or sanction dilatory tactics by the tenant (ortenant's attorney), or by the PHA. Both the PHA and the tenant have a legitimateinterest in expeditious handling of grievances. Where a grievance hearingis required under the statute and this rule, the tenant must be given the``opportunity'' for a grievance hearing. However, the fair opportunityfor a hearing does not entail acquiescence to deliberate or unreasonabledelay by either party.C. Eviction by Judicial Process<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Prohibition of ``Self-Help'' Eviction </ITAG>The rule provides that the PHA may only evict the unit occupants througha ``civil court proceeding'' (andSection; 966.23(a)). In State court, thePHA must show that there is ground for eviction, and the tenant may presenta defense. To safeguard the tenant's opportunity for a judicial hearingbefore eviction, the rule prohibits the PHA from requiring tenant to agreeto lease provisions which would sign away in advance the tenant's rightto a judicial hearing (andSection; 966.11(e); see also prohibited lease provisions<T3>passim</T3> (andSection; 966.11)). To give the tenant notice of the opportunityfor judicial hearing before eviction, a notice of lease termination mustadvise the tenant that the PHA may only evict the occupants through a civilcourt proceeding in which the tenant has the opportunity to present a defense(andSection; 966.22(b)(4)). The requirement for eviction through court process is intended to bar theuse of ``self-help'' evictions, in which the landlord evicts the tenantbefore a court has decided that there is ground for termination of tenancy.The rule precludes the use by a PHA of non-judicial process for evictionof a tenant, even if self-help evictions are permitted under State law.Legal aid comment states that the rule should prohibit use of any self-helpremedies, and should prohibit any waiver of the tenant's right to exclusiveuse of judicial process for eviction. Comment asserts that some Statesallow self-help eviction tactics, such as lockout or utility shut-off,which effectively deprive tenants of possession without judicial hearing,and that under the law in at least one State landlords may recover possessionof the premises under criminal procedure, which includes a requirementfor the tenant to post bond, and authorization for jail or criminal fines.Under the rule, the occupants may not be evicted unless the tenant hasthe opportunity for a judicial hearing on the tenant's defenses to eviction,and there is a judicial decision that the PHA has good cause for terminationof tenancy (serious or repeated violation of the lease or other good cause).The rule does not seek to enumerate and proscribe PHA practices which impermissiblyinterfere with the tenant's possession and enjoyment of the unit beforea judicial decision on the termination of tenancy. The requirement foreviction through judicial action is amply stated in the rule. Actions bya PHA which amount to a dispossession without judicial action, e.g., alockout, are covered by the regulations. Evidently, there is a whole spectrum of possible actions by a PHA respectingthe tenant's continuing occupancy. The question of whether PHA actionsso interfere with the tenant's possession as to compromise the tenant'sright to a judicial determination before deprivation of full enjoymentand possession of the unit is best applied by individual courts in individualcases (or in the PHA administrative grievance procedure where the PHA hasnot opted to exclude a grievance on an eviction or termination of tenancy),rather than by imposing additional Federal regulatory restrictions. Untila judicial determination on the tenant's right of occupancy under the lease,the tenant possesses all of the rights stated in the lease, embracing theright to the services, maintenance and utilities specified in the lease,and the right to use and occupancy of the unit in accordance with the lease.Comment objects to the prohibition of self-help eviction, and to the requirementfor eviction through court process. The recommendation to delete theseprovisions is not accepted. Occupancy rights of assisted families shouldnot be abridged or denied without the opportunity for a fair hearing incourt. Comment asks authority to evict without a court hearing if the tenant violatesa court-approved settlement. This recommendation is not adopted. In allcases, the tenant should have the opportunity for a court hearing priorto eviction from the unit. In the rule, the term ``eviction'' is defined as ``forcing the occupantsto move out of the dwelling unit'' (andSection; 966.2). A separate provision,utilizing the defined concept of eviction, prohibits the PHA from evictingthe tenant other than through a court proceeding (andSection; 966.23(a)).Comment states that ``eviction'' should be defined as forcing the tenantout through ``court action''. The change is not adopted. It is most preciseto define the concept of a forced dispossession (in the definition of ``eviction''),and to state separately the prohibition of a dispossession (eviction) otherthan through court action.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Prohibition of Criminal Process for Eviction </ITAG>The rule provides (andSection; 966.23(a)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The PHA may only evict occupants from the dwelling unit: (1) Througha civil court proceeding in which the Tenant has the opportunity to presenta defense, and (2) after a decision by the court on the rights of the parties.</ITAG>The PHA may only evict by using a ``civil court proceeding''. The ruledoes not allow the use of criminal process for eviction of the tenant.There are several reasons for this prohibition:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The State's designation of particular court process as a ``criminal''proceeding indicates that the process is designed and intended by the Statefor punishment and deterrence of crime. The prime function of the evictionremedy in public housing should not be to punish or deter criminal action,but to restore the unit to the PHA for rental to another tenant.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Remedies in a criminal process are more drastic than in a civil proceeding,and are not proportioned to the simple correction of the injury causedby the defendant. Criminal penalties such as jailing and criminal finesare not necessary or appropriate remedies for removal of a public housingtenant who violates the lease.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Criminal process is designed to determine if the defendant has violateda criminal statute. In eviction of a public housing family, the centralquestion should be whether the tenant has violated the lease, or thereis other good cause for termination of tenancy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Use of criminal process for eviction may tag the tenant or familymembers with the onus of criminal violation, or a criminal record. Behaviorwhich justifies termination of tenancy (e.g., injury to other residents)may or may not be criminal in character. If criminal, the crime may beprosecuted. However, the immediate benefit of eviction for the PHA is notthe prosecution of crime, but the possession of the unit. The functionof regaining possession of the unit may be accomplished through a civileviction process.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_HUD is not aware that any State lacks an adequate civil evictionprocess. While some comment urges that PHAs should be allowed to use criminalprocedures to gain possession of the unit in some circumstances, commentdoes not allege the absence of an effective civil eviction process in anyjurisdiction.</ITAG>Comment states that the PHA should be allowed to use criminal process toevict a tenant who damages PHA property or equipment, who is a seriousthreat to health or safety of other tenants or PHA employees, or who commitscriminal offenses. The Preamble to the proposed rule stated (51 FR 26514, July 23, 1986) thatthe prohibition of resort to criminal proceedings for eviction is not intendedto regulate or interfere with the use of the criminal process by the PHAto remedy a breach of peace by members of the family, or resort to criminalprocess for ejectment of a family which is damaging the unit or project,or endangering other families or PHA personnel. Comments recommend thatthis interpretation of the prohibition should be added to the text of theregulation.The final rule is revised to describe the intended relation between theprohibition on use of criminal process for eviction of the occupants, andthe ordinary and continuing role of criminal process to remedy criminalbehavior by individual members of the family. The final rule provides (andSection;966.23(b)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The requirement for eviction through a civil court proceeding is bindingon the PHA, but is not intended to limit arrest, prosecution or other criminalenforcement activities by Federal, State or local law enforcement authoritiesagainst members of the Household for any crime. The PHA and its officers,employees or agents may act as complainants or witnesses in any criminalenforcement activity, and may cooperate with law enforcement authoritiesin any criminal enforcement activity.</ITAG>This new language is intended to clarify that the prohibition against PHAuse of a criminal proceeding for eviction of the occupants does not inany way insulate the occupants from ordinary criminal process or prosecutionfor any criminal act. Criminal enforcement may result in arrest or confinement,and therefore the removal of a family member from the unit for the periodof confinement. Criminal enforcement against individual family membersdoes not, however, directly determine the contractual right of the tenantto continued occupancy of the unit for residence by the family under thelease.Crime or conviction of a crime by a family member does not automaticallyterminate the right to occupancy of the unit. The contractual right tooccupancy of the unit is determined by decision of the landlord-tenantcourt in a civil eviction proceeding brought by the PHA against the tenant.In the civil eviction proceeding, criminal activity or criminal convictionis ground for termination of the legal right of the tenant to occupy theunit. The PHA may evict after the court in the civil eviction action decidesthat the crime is good cause for the eviction.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Administrative Grievance Procedure</ITAG>A. LegislationSection 6(k) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437d(k); addedin 1983 by section 204 of the 1983 law) provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary shall by regulation require each public housing agency* * * to establish and implement an administrative grievance procedureunder which tenants will_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) be advised of the specific grounds of any proposed adverse publichousing agency action;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) have an opportunity for a hearing before an impartial party upontimely request within [the statutory period for a notice of lease termination];</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) have an opportunity to examine any documents or records or regulationsrelated to the proposed action;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) be entitled to be represented by another person of his choiceat any hearing;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) be entitled to ask questions of witnesses and have others makestatements on his behalf; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) be entitled to receive a written decision by the public housingagency on the proposed action.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">An agency may exclude from its procedure any grievance concerningan eviction or termination of tenancy in any jurisdiction which requiresthat, prior to eviction, a tenant be given a hearing in court which theSecretary determines provide the basic elements of due process.</ITAG>B.Subject of Grievance Hearing<ITAG tagnum="81">1. New Rule</ITAG>The old rule contained a sweeping requirement to give a grievance hearingon ``any dispute'' concerning PHA action or non-action affecting the individualtenant. In accordance with section 6(k) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937,the final rule requires a PHA to establish an administrative grievanceprocedure for hearing on <T3>any proposed PHA adverse action </T3>affecting the individual tenant(andSection; 966.30(b)).The final rule provides (andSection; 966.31(a)(2)) that proposed adverseaction means any of the following proposed decisions by the PHA concerningan individual tenant:<ITAG tagnum="21">(i) A proposed decision to terminate the tenancy, or to evict occupantsfrom the dwelling unit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) A proposed decision to require the Tenant to move to anotherdwelling unit * * *,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) A proposed decision determining:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) The amount of the Tenant Rent payable by the Tenant to the PHAor the amount of utility reimbursement by the PHA to the Tenant,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) The amount of PHA charges in addition to Tenant Rent * * *, or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) The amount the Tenant owes the PHA for Tenant Rent or PHA charges.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) A proposed decision to take over specific, concrete, and affirmativeindividualized action contrary to the interests of a Tenant.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Scope of Right To Grieve</ITAG><T3>a. Legislative History_Distinction Between PHA Action and PHA Failureto Act. </T3>The statutory grievance requirement under the 1983 law finallyenacted by the Congress applies to ``any proposed adverse public housingagency action'' (Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983, Pub. L.98-181, November 30, 1983, section 204; section 6(k) of the U.S. HousingAct of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)). As originally reported by the House BankingCommittee in May 1983, the House bill would have required PHAs to providetenants the opportunity to be heard in accordance with grievance safeguardsin the HUD lease and grievance rule in effect at that date, i.e., the oldlease and grievance rule. Under the House Committee bill, the grievancerequirement would have applied to ``public housing agency actions <T3>or failures to act </T3>that adversely affect [tenant and applicant]<T3>rights, duties, welfare or status</T3>'' (emphasis supplied) (Report98-123 on H.R. 1, p. 175). The House Committee Report states that ``thebill provides that the grievance procedures shall be available for <T3>all disputes </T3>between a PHA and * * * a tenant or former tenant''(emphasis supplied) (<T3>Id</T3>., p. 35). The House Committee Report also states that the ``Committeecontemplates that HUD will meet this obligation [to require PHAs to maintaingrievance procedures] <T3>by retaining the present regulations</T3>'' (emphasis supplied) (<T3>Id</T3>., p. 35).The bill originally passed by the House of Representatives (H.R. 1, section206, passed House on July 13, 1983) contains the same language on the statutorygrievance requirement as the bill previously reported by the House BankingCommittee. The language of the House bill would have required PHA administrativehearings in almost every case in which a tenant contests a PHA action orfailure to act that affects a tenant's rights, duties, welfare or status.Thus the original House bill would have essentially codified the grievancerequirement under the old HUD rule. This language was not, however, enactedby Congress.The law finally enacted by the Congress in November 1983 deleted the broadgrievance language in the original House bill (Pub. L. 98-181, see legislativehistory at 97 Stat. 1299). The 1983 law eliminated the proposed requirement,contained in the original House bill, to establish a grievance proceduresubject to requirements of the old rule, to grieve on disputes pertainingto a PHA's ``failures to act'', or on ``all disputes'' concerning actsor failures to act that adversely affect tenant ``rights, duties, welfareor status''.The Congress deleted the proposed requirement to grieve on PHA ``failuresto act'', and added instead a requirement to grieve on a ``proposed adverseaction'' (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(k), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)).The legislative history supports the conclusion that the statute only requiresa PHA to give the tenant the opportunity to grieve on specific proposedPHA actions concerning the individual tenant, as opposed to PHA failureto act. The legislative history also indicates that the grievance requirement inthe 1983 law does not apply broadly to ``all disputes'' that adverselyaffect a tenant's rights, duties, welfare or status, as under the old rule.Unlike the old rule, the statutory grievance requirement does not broadlycover cases in which a tenant asserts the existence of a dispute or potentialdispute with the PHA (see old rule andSection; 966.51(a) and 966.53(a)).The grievance requirement applies to a case where the PHA is consideringwhether to take specific, concrete and affirmative individualized ``action'',and the action is ``adverse'', i.e., contrary to the interests of an individualtenant.A decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit, in <T3>Samuels v. D.C. et al.</T3>, 770 F.2d 184 (DC Cir. 1985), has expresseda different conclusion on the reach of the statutory grievance requirement.The DC Court of Appeals says that Congress intended to preserve HUD's existingregulatory grievance structure, and that the statutory grievance requirementapplies to all tenant disputes covered under the then-extant HUD regulation.The <T3>Samuels </T3>court rejects the position that the new statutory grievancerequirement applies only to proposed affirmative future action againsta tenant, and denies that there is a statutory distinction between actionand failure to act.HUD was not a party to this case. Therefore, the court had no opportunityto consider the interpretation of the statute by the agency which administersthe statute. Many decisions affirm that the interpretation of the administeringagency is entitled to deference by the courts. The Supreme Court recentlyremarked that ``HUD's opinion as to available tenant remedies under theHousing Act is entitled to some deference by this Court'' (<T3>Wright v. Roanoke</T3>, 479 U.S. _, _, 107 S. Ct. 766, 772 (1987)).The decision by the <T3>Samuels </T3>court is based on a plain misunderstanding of the legislativehistory of the statutory grievance requirement. The court's reading oflegislative intent is based on <T3>the original House Bill</T3>, not on the bill actually passed by theCongress. To support the court's view of the meaning of Section 6(k), thedecision repeatedly cites the House Committee Report (and also cites astatement by a Congressman on the floor of the House). The court did notknow, and was not informed by the parties, that the actual language ofthe law finally passed by the Congress differs radically from the languageoriginally approved by the House and the House Committee. (The briefs andrecord on appeal in <T3>Samuels </T3>do not contain any mention or explanation of the differencebetween the House bill and the final statute.) Indeed, the changes fromthe bill proposed by the House demonstrate that Congress rejected the broadgrievance requirement originally proposed by the House. The changes showthat Congress did not intend to codify the broad existing regulatory grievancerequirement for disputes between the PHA and a tenant, and that the statutorygrievance requirement only applies to an adverse <T3>action </T3>proposed by a PHA.In accordance with the 1983 law passed by the Congress, the final rule(andSection; 966.31(a)) requires the PHA to provide the tenant the opportunityfor a hearing on any proposed <T3>adverse action</T3>. The rule (andSection; 966.31(a)(2)) specifies whatproposed PHA actions are adverse actions on which the tenant must be giventhe opportunity for a hearing.Comment from the legal aid community vehemently protests the distinctionbetween PHA action and non-action, asserting that the tenant should havea broad right to grieve on the PHA's failure to act. Comment objects toHUD's reading of the legislative history of the 1983 law, and objects thatHUD does not acquiesce in the decision of the DC Court of Appeals in <T3>Samuels</T3>.The House bill provided that the PHA must grieve on any PHA ``actions <T3>or failures to act</T3>.'' The law finally passed by the Congress andsigned by the President provides that tenants must have the right to grieveon any proposed ``adverse public housing agency <T3>action</T3>.'' Legal aid comment states that HUD relies too much onthis change in the wording of the statute, and that HUD should insteadrely (as did the court in <T3>Samuels</T3>) on the Report of the House Banking Committee in reportingout the original language. Comment states that the PHA's <T3>denial </T3>of the tenant's request for action amounts to affirmativeaction.Comment states that the 1983 law did not enact a new grievance requirement,but codified the language ``always used'' to define what is grievable underthe old rule. This assertion is false. The old rule provided that a grievanceis <T3>``any dispute''</T3> a tenant may choose to raise ``with respect toPHA <T3>action or failure to act''</T3> concerning the individual tenant (andSection;966.53(a) of the old rule). The law passed in 1983 only requires a grievancehearing on a proposed ``adverse action''. The language of the old ruleis sharply different from the language of the 1983 law.In substance, legal aid comment asks HUD to ignore the actual languageand history of the 1983 law. The legal aid position does not square withthe plain and literal language of the statute, which in terms requiresa grievance hearing only for a proposed adverse <T3>``action''</T3>. Treating the PHA <T3>refusal to act</T3> as an affirmative proposed adverse <T3>action,</T3> as proposed by public comment, erases the deliberate statutorydistinction between PHA action and non-action.The fact that Congress did not require a grievance hearing for a PHA failureto act is clearly shown by deletion of the prior House bill language thatmandated a grievance hearing on a PHA ``failure to act''. This legislativehistory was not known to the court in <T3>Samuels.</T3> HUD will follow the law. HUD will not pretend, as suggestedby the comment, that the law passed by the Congress was the same as thebill originally passed by the House.The law finally enacted by the Congress in 1983 does not define ``adverseaction''. The differences between the original House bill and the 1983law as passed indicate that the Congress intended to leave the Departmenta degree of administrative discretion in defining the ambit and operationof the new grievance requirement, rather than bind HUD to continue thespecific grievance requirements under the old rule.On February 5, 1988, the President signed into law a broad housing bill,titled the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 (HCD Act of 1987)(Pub. L. 100-242, February 5, 1988). During the process leading to enactmentof the HCD Act of 1987, there was an unsuccessful attempt to amend thegrievance requirement under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. The bill firstpassed by the House of Representatives would have amended the grievanceprovision to require a grievance hearing on PHA ``failure to act'', inaddition to proposed PHA adverse ``action'' (proposed amendment of section6(k) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 at section 119 of S. 825, as passedby the House of Representatives on 6/17/87; Congressional Record 6/17/87,H 5110). This proposed amendment was eliminated in Conference, and wasnot included in the law finally enacted by the Congress. The ConferenceReport states (Rpt. 100-426, p. 167):<ITAG tagnum="21">The House amendment contained a provision that was not contained inthe Senate bill to clarify that the mandatory public housing grievanceprocedure cover[s] a PHA's failure to act, as well as its actions. <T3>The conference report does not contain the House provisions.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Congress has always intended that the mandatory public housing grievanceprocedure apply to failures to act, such as failure to maintain housingin decent condition, failure to provide timely subsidy increases when incomesdrop, or failure to provide appropriate utility allowances. In fact, thecourt ruling in <T3>Samuels v. District of Columbia,</T3> 770 F.2d 184 (DC Cir 1985) confirmedthat PHA omissions or failures to act are grievable. HUD, however, haspublished proposed regulations [HUD's proposed lease and grievance ruleof July 23, 1986] which create an artificial distinction between actionsand omissions. Therefore, the conferees intend that HUD revise these regulationsto be consistent with the ruling in <T3>Samuels.</T3> (Emphasis supplied.)</ITAG>HUD must respectfully demur to the interpretation of the 1983 law statedin the Conference Report on the HCD Act of 1987. First, the proposed amendmentof the statutory grievance requirement was not included in the 1987 ConferenceReport, and was not passed by the Congress. HUD is only bound by law enactedby the Congress. Second, the Conference Report is not law in itself. Third,the 1987 Conference Report language does not construe language of the 1987law, but purports to construe language passed in a prior Congress. Theseafter-the-fact remarks in 1987 are not part of the legislative historyof the 1983 law. They are not evidence of the legislative process and thinkingthat led to enactment of the 1983 law. Fourth, the construction posed bythe 1987 Conference is inconsistent with the actual legislative historyand legislative language of the 1983 law.<T3>b. PHA Adverse Action</T3>_(1) Proposed Rule and Comments. The rulerequires a PHA to grieve on an adverse action. The rule defines (andSection;966.31(a)(2)) what PHA actions are adverse actions. The PHA must give thetenant the opportunity for a grievance hearing on any proposed adverseaction.In the proposed rule, HUD defined adverse action to cover three specificcases when the PHA proposes to take action contrary to interests of thefamily: When the PHA seeks to evict the family, requires the family totransfer from one public housing unit to another, or determines rent orPHA charges.Legal aid comment contends that adverse action is too narrowly definedin the proposed rule. HUD should not shave the grievance requirement tothe bare minimum. Comment claims that restricting the grievance right tospecific PHA actions defined in the rule violates the statutory requirementfor grievance on any proposed adverse action.Legal aid comment urges HUD to vastly open-up the types of PHA actionswhich must be treated as grievable adverse actions. Comment states thatthe rule should contain an open-ended definition of adverse action. Therule should give examples of adverse action, but recognize that other_non-listed_actionsmay be adverse. The family should have a broad right to grieve on PHA actions,including a PHA claim that the family has violated PHA rules, PHA issuanceof a warning to the family, or a PHA demand to inspect the unit. HUD shouldretain a very broad grievance requirement similar to the grievance requirementunder the old rule.The PHA should give the tenant notice of the opportunity for hearing whenthe PHA sends any notice ``adverse'' to the tenant. Legal aid comment states that grievance hearings benefit the PHA and tenantfamilies:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The grievance hearing is a remedy for lawless and arbitrary actionby a PHA. The grievance process deters PHA misconduct. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Tenants feel alienated and powerless. The grievance process is anoutlet for tenant frustration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The grievance process is a good mechanism to resolve disputes. Thegrievance process helps PHA management, and can save time and money. </ITAG>_Narrowing the grievance process is a hardship to tenants. Tenants mustrisk eviction to challenge PHA action.Some comment states that the language of the rule is not clear as to whetherthe list of three cases which constitute adverse action under the proposedrule is an exclusive list. PHA comment asserts that the rule invites theconclusion that <T3>any </T3>PHA action is adverse. Legal aid comment objects to the implicationthat the listed cases are the only grievable adverse actions by a PHA.In general, PHAs and PHA organizations strongly support the new grievanceprocess proposed by HUD, and HUD's proposed definition of adverse action.The tenant should not be allowed to grieve on ``any dispute'' concerningPHA action or non-action. A broad grievance requirement is cumbersome,and interferes with operation by the PHA. PHA comment on the expense and administrative burden of the old grievancerequirement is also discussed in section VI.B of this Preamble (which dealswith the procedure for excluding eviction cases from the PHA's administrativegrievance process). Public comment on the original proposed rule (publishedin December 1982) discusses many of the arguments for and against changesin the scope of the old grievance procedure. Comment is summarized in thePreamble to the proposed rule published in July 1986 (Preamble, sectionIV.A, 51 FR 26504, 26514-15, July 23, 1986). (2) Right to Grieve on PHA Adverse Action_(a) Definition of Adverse Action.Under the language of the 1983 law, the PHA must grieve on any proposed<T3>adverse action </T3>by a PHA. On the face of the statutory language,there is no duty to grieve unless three elements are present: (1) Thatthe PHA proposes some ``action'' (as discussed above in section V.B.2.aof this Preamble), (2) that the action is ``proposed'' by the PHA, and(3) that the proposed action is ``adverse'' to the tenant. The statutedoes not obligate the PHA to give a hearing on <T3>any </T3>action, as urged by legal aid comment, but only on actionswhich are ``proposed'' by the PHA, and which are ``adverse'' to the interestof the tenant. The concept of proposed adverse action only applies to acase where the PHA is considering taking (``proposes'' to take) specific,concrete and affirmative individualized action contrary to (``adverse''to) the interests of a tenant. PHAs and tenants need to know what kinds of PHA action are ``adverse''action for which the PHA must give the opportunity for a hearing. The statutedoes not precisely define how to apply the concept of adverse action. HUDhas authority to issue a legislative rule which defines what types of PHAaction must be treated as ``adverse'' action. This authority is based onHUD's broad power to issue rules concerning HUD programs (section 7(d)of the HUD Act, 42 U.S.C. 3535(d)), and also on HUD's specific statutoryresponsibility to issue regulations which implement the administrativegrievance requirement (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(k), 42 U.S.C.1437d(k)). Under the proposed and final rules, adverse action includes a PHA decisionwhich affects the critical interest of the assisted tenant in continuingto live in public housing (eviction), in living in the same unit (requiringtenant to move to another public housing unit), and in the amount the tenantmust pay to the PHA (rent or PHA charges). The rule provides that proposedadverse action includes andSection;966.31(a)((2)):<ITAG tagnum="15">_A proposed decision to terminate the tenancy, or to evict the occupants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A proposed decision to require the Tenant to move to another dwellingunit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_A proposed decision determining the amount of rent or PHA charges,or the amount the Tenant owes the PHA for rent or charges.</ITAG>In practice, these three types of PHA decision and action comprise thevast majority of instances in which a PHA contemplates taking concreteaction adverse to the individual tenant. Indeed, it is difficult to imagineplausible scenarios of proposed PHA adverse action other than the threespecified cases. However, to assure that the opportunity for a grievancehearing is not denied for ``any'' proposed adverse action in accordancewith the 1983 law, the final rule adds to the definition of adverse actiona provision that adverse action also includes a ``proposed decision totake other specific, concrete, and affirmative individualized action contraryto the interests to a Tenant'' andSection;966.31(a)(2)(iv)). Comment states that the tenant should have the right to grieve if the PHArefuses to abate the rent for alleged PHA non-performance of unit maintenance.A PHA proposed decision determining ``the amount the Tenant owes the PHAfor Tenant Rent * * * *'' is included in the definition of proposed adverseaction andSection;966.31(a)(2)(iii)(C)). The PHA is therefore required togrieve on the decision. A PHA's decision that the rent will not be abatedis part of the positive determination of how much the tenant owes to thePHA, and is grievable under the rule. (b) PHA Warnings. Comment suggests that the PHA should have to give thetenant a hearing if the PHA issues a warning. The PHA may tell the tenantthat behavior by family members is a violation of the project rules, andthat if the behavior continues the PHA may take action to evict the tenant.If the PHA ultimately takes action to terminate the tenancy, the tenantwill have the right to a hearing on the proposed termination of tenancy.The question therefore is not whether the PHA must give a grievance hearingif the PHA finally decides to take action to terminate the tenancy. Thequestion is whether the PHA must give a hearing on preliminary statementsby the PHA which may or may not ever lead to any concrete action by thePHA against the tenant, whether HUD must therefore accelerate tenant'sright to a grievance hearing.   HUD believes that the 1983 law does not require, and program policy doesnot support, imposing a Federal requirement to grieve on warnings or otherinitial statements by the PHA that may possibly be followed by PHA actionadverse to the tenant. Acceleration of the PHA's duty to give a grievancehearing inhibits the day-to-day effort of the PHA to work out problemswith tenant families, and to educate families in the responsibilities oftenancy. The issuance of a warning can be a constructive tool to inducethe tenant to comply with the lease or PHA rules, avoiding the need foreviction of the family.If the right to grieve is available too early_before a PHA has definitivelydecided to evict a family_the grievance requirement may inhibit frank andfree communication between the PHA and the tenant. The grievance processtakes up the time of PHA personnel, including the time to prepare for administrativehearings and the time to give evidence at the hearings. For this reason,PHA personnel may be reluctant to warn tenants that family behavior violatesthe lease or PHA rules, or that the family could be evicted if the behavioris continued. The consequence of such reluctance leads in two directions.First, the general level of project discipline may decline. PHA officialsmay relax the pressure for a tenant to comply with PHA requirements. Second,PHAs may proceed directly to eviction. Instead of counselling or warninga tenant, the PHA may move more rapidly to evict a family which fails tocomply with the lease.<T3>c. PHA Non-Action_Denial of Right to Grieve.</T3> Legal aid commentargues that it is bad policy to deny a sweeping right to grieve on a PHA'srefusal to take action desired by a tenant. PHA failure to act should bea required grievance subject. Often PHA wrongs against a tenant take theform of the PHA's failure to act. PHA inaction can harm public housingresidents. The availability of the grievance remedy should not be limitedto cases of conscious proposed action by the PHA.Comment claims that broadening the grievance right to cover PHA inactionis best for the PHA and for the tenant, or that refusal to provide a grievanceprocess for PHA inaction is poor management. Comment states that the grievanceprocess is an effective tool to make the PHA take necessary action, suchas action to maintain tenant units. If the PHA's failure to act is notgrievable, the grievance process is almost useless as a vehicle to improveconditions for individual tenants, for example by requiring a PHA to repairunits that violate local code. The tenant must risk eviction to challengePHA non-action, by raising the PHA's non-action as a defense to eviction.According to comment, the following are examples of the types of PHA non-actionson which the PHA should be compelled to grieve: PHA violation of the lease,refusal to maintain or repair (obligations under the lease or State law),refusal to abate rent if a unit is not repaired, refusal to grant a requestfor transfer to another unit, refusal to adjust rent, refusal to add newfamily members (as authorized residents of the unit), refusal to take actionagainst offending neighbors.In the final rule, the PHA is required to give a grievance hearing to thetenant on any <T3>proposed adverse action.</T3> However, the rule does not exceed theFederal grievance right beyond the requirements of the 1983 law. A tenantdoes not have the right to a grievance to challenge a PHA's non-actionor refusal to act.Federal law only requires a grievance hearing on a decision by the PHAto take positive action adverse to a tenant. The law does not require grievancehearing on a PHA non-action. Public comment recommends that HUD broadlyextend the hearing right to cases of PHA inaction. However, comment doesnot make a persuasive argument for broadly expanding the grievance requirementbeyond PHA adverse action, as required by the law. The Congress has implicitlyweighed the putative advantage of creating a broader grievance right againstthe restriction of local autonomy, and against the problems of operatinga grievance apparatus that applies to PHA non-actions. HUD does not havesufficient reason to impose a duty for the PHA to grieve on PHA non-action,and PHA non-action is beyond the reach of the 1983 law.Coverage of PHA non-action would vastly enlarge the sphere of project managementpotentially subject to determination by hearing officers in individualgrievance hearings. Allocation of authority to hearing officers fragmentsthe process of making decisions affecting project management and the livesof project residents. Extension of the sphere controlled by PHA hearingofficers is correspondingly a contraction of the sphere controlled by PHAmanagement. Where hearings are required, day to day actions by PHA managementmay be reviewed and reversed by decision of a hearing officer. For effectivemanagement, the PHA needs a broad right and ability to determine how projectsare run. Dramatic extension of the grievance process dramatically diminishesthe ability of the PHA to manage the housing for the over-all benefit ofthe residents.An administrative hearing is sometimes a suitable process to decide ifthe PHA has rightly applied laws or rules to the case of a particular tenant.However, an administrative hearing is not a suitable process for determiningmatters committed to management discretion. The PHA decision whether ornot to take action desired by a tenant most often involved matters properlycommitted to the judgment and discretion of the PHA, not matters that canbe or should be decided by the simple and unambiguous application of agoverning legal rule.Comment states that a PHA should have to give a hearing if the PHA refusesto take action against a neighboring family. This is preeminently a typeof case where the PHA must exercise a difficult and properly discretionarymanagement judgment, that should properly be tempered by compassion forboth of the families, and by the interest of other project families. Thebasis of decision is not readily reducible to any formula or legal rule.Comment states that the PHA should have to give a hearing on the tenant'srequest for transfer to another unit (not just when the PHA has decidedto make the tenant move). Comment notes, for example, that an old couplemay ask for transfer to a bigger unit so that a relative can move in; atenant may request transfer on advice of a doctor; a disabled tenant mayrequest transfer to a suitable unit. However, these are all cases wherethe PHA should have administrative discretion to respond to varied circumstances.They are not cases which should be controlled by precise and inflexiblerules determined in advance. Consequently also, they are not cases thatshould be assigned to decision by a hearing officer.A PHA has at its disposal a limited number of units. Typically, the demandis much larger than the supply. A unit is only occupied by one family ata time. Therefore a decision to use the unit for occupancy by some particularfamily, such as a family that wants to move to a better unit or a biggerunit, is effectively a decision to deny the unit to other families, includingfamilies on the PHA waiting list. Thus the decision to grant or deny thetransfer request is not usually controlled by a simple rule. HUD shouldnot require that such decisions be placed in the hands of a hearing examiner.In some cases, a tenant may claim that a PHA's failure to act is a violationof a rule_for example, a PHA's failure to maintain the unit in decent,safe and sanitary condition in accordance with the lease. Even in suchcases, PHA funds and maintenance resources are limited. It is impossiblefor the PHA to fix all units at the same time. The PHA legitimately needsto decide the relative priority of different maintenance demands. In acontext of scarce resources, the decision on how to allocate maintenanceresources between different units and tenants is a legitimate managementdecision, not a decision that should be mechanically handed over to a hearingofficer.PHA failure to perform concrete obligations to the tenant under the lawor the lease may present difficult problems, for which there is no easyor universal solution, and for which the tenant may not have any simpleremedy, short of litigation. Nevertheless, the Department is not convincedthat these problems can be facilely solved by imposing a national grievancerequirement for PHA inaction.  Since 1975, PHAs have been subject to the extensive administrative grievancerequirement under the old lease and grievance rule. This grievance requirementapplied to the PHA's failure to act. Legal aid comment urges HUD to retainthe substance of the grievance coverage under the old rule. However, experienceunder the old rule does not demonstrate that this broad grievance coverageresults in a higher level of PHA compliance with the lease and the law.In comment on this rulemaking, and in other forums, PHAs assert that theold grievance requirement has been difficult and expensive to administer,and has contributed to management problems of the PHAs.  In this rule, the definition of ``adverse'' action is not indiscriminatelyextended, as advocated by legal aid comment, to all manner of miscellaneousPHA non-actions. Rather, the final rule follows the line of distinctionenacted by the Congress in 1983. The rule requires a PHA to grieve on anyproposed adverse action, but not on PHA nonaction. PHA comment indicatesthat the over-broad extension of the right to grieve can drain PHA resources,and can distort the management of public housing projects. The statutoryconcept of <T3>adverse </T3>action exhibits Congressional recognition that the grievancerights should be limited to critical and central cases when the PHA proposesto take positive action against the tenant.  Legal aid comment objects to HUD's review that the statutory concept ofadverse action applies to conscious and specific individualized actioncontrary to the interests of the tenant. The comment states that when aPHA <T3>denies a request </T3>for transfer, the PHA is acting consciously,is considering an individualized matter, and is acting contrary to interestsof the family. However, this example concerns a PHA <T3>non-action </T3>in response to a family request. The example does notconcern a <T3>proposed action </T3>by the PHA. The tenant does not convert a PHAnon-action into a grievable proposed action by submitting a request tobe refused by the PHA.  The notion of ``proposed'' adverse action clearly conveys the statutorysense that the type of action which is grievable under the law proceedsinitially from the initiative of the PHA, such as the action of the PHAin seeking to evict the tenant. In a common sense understanding, the PHAdoes not oridinarily ``propose'' to take a non-action (such as not sendinga plumber to the unit).  The PHA also does not ``propose'' to deny action requested by the tenant.The PHA simply fails or refuses to take the requested action.  Comment assumes that the statutory requirement to grieve on ``proposedadverse action'' applies to PHA non-action. In this view, then, the scopeof matters to be grieved would include ``proposed adverse non-actions''.In the real world, this concept has little meaning or potential practicalapplication. PHAs do not ``propose'' to take non-action adverse to theinterest of the tenant. The assertion that proposed ``action'' includesproposed ``non-action'' is not supported by the text of the statute, orby the legislative history. Rather, the test of the statute refers onlyto ``action'', and not to non-action. Further, the Congress deleted theproposed requirement to grieve on PHA non-action under the original Housebill.  Comment protests that the distinction between action and non-action issomehow arbitrary. HUD remarks that the distinction proceeds directly fromthe plain and literal language of the statute. The Congress made this distinctionby eliminating the coverage of PHA <T3>failure to act </T3>contained in the original House bill (see discussionof legislative history in section V.B.2.a of this Preamble). The Congressalso expressed this distinction by adding to the original language of theHouse bill the requirement that the PHA must give the opportunity to grieveon a ``proposed'' adverse action. A PHA does not, in the normal sense ofthe term, ``propose'' to do nothing. The PHA proposes to take some ``action'',and the grievance right only applies when the PHA is proposing to takeaction that is also ``adverse'' to the tenant.  The 1983 law provides that the tenant must be advised of the ``specificgrounds of any proposed adverse public housing agency action'' (U.S. HousingAct of 1937, section 6(k)(1), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)(1)). Thus the PHA mustgive the tenant notice of grounds for a ``proposed'' action. The statutecontemplates notice to the tenant of a specific adverse action which thePHA expects to take in the future respecting the tenant, not notice ofan already existing non-action (e.g., an alleged failure to maintain theunit) which the tenant may want to challenge.  Comment claims it is arbitrary to distinguish between a case when the PHAcharges the tenant for repairs (a grievable adverse action) and when thePHA refuses to make repairs (a non-grievable non-action). Similarly commentstates that it is arbitrary to distinguish between a case when the PHArequires the tenant to move (grievable) and a case when the PHA deniesthe tenant's request for a transfer (non-grievable). However, in theseexamples, there are plain and substantial differences between the actionswhich are grievable and the non-actions which are not. The cases whichare grievable under the rule each involve a proposal by the PHA to takeaway something which the tenant already possesses_a public housing unitor money in the tenant's pocket. The cases which are not grievable underthe rule involve the desire of a tenant for something which the tenantwants but does not yet have (such as repair of the unit, or a move to anew unit). The distinction between grievable and non-grievable cases underthe statute and this rule is both reasonable and practical.  <T3>d. Termination of Tenancy or Eviction. </T3>Section 6(k) of the U.S.Housing Act of 1937, as added by the 1983 law, states the circumstancesin which the PHA may exclude from its administrative grievance procedure``any grievance concerning any eviction or termination of tenancy'' (42U.S.C. 1437d(k)). Conversely, the statutory language implies that unlessso excluded a PHA decision for eviction or termination of tenancy is anadverse action upon which the tenant may ask for a grievance hearing. A PHA must have a good cause reason for action to terminate legal rightsof occupancy (``termination of tenancy''), or to force the occupants tomove from the unit (``eviction'') (definitions in andSection;966.2). Thestatutory grievance scheme assures that the tenant may not be compelledto move from the unit without the opportunity for either an administrativegrievance hearing before the PHA, or a due process hearing in State court,on the question of good cause.  ``Termination of tenancy'' (andSection;966.2) includes a termination of thelease during the term, or a decision not to renew the lease at the endof the term.  <T3>e. Rent or PHA Charges </T3>(1) What is Grievable? The PHA must grieveon a proposed adverse action. The rule provides (andSection;966.31(a)(2)(iii))that adverse action includes a PHA's determination of:    1. The amount of tenant rent payable by the tenant to the PHA or the amountof utility reimbursement by the PHA to the tenant. 2. The amount of PHA charges in addition to tenant rent. 3. The amount the tenant owes the PHA for tenant rent or PHA charges. The final rule clarifies that the tenant may grieve if the PHA does notconduct a reexamination of family income (i) for more than a year afterthe last examination or reexamination, or (ii) after receiving informationconcerning a change in family income or composition between regularly scheduledreexaminations (andSection; 966.31(a)(4)). The rule provides that the PHA'sdetermination of the amount of tenant rent payable by the tenant to thePHA in the absence of a reexamination is included in the concept of adverseactions affecting determination of tenant rent. The PHA's decision to continuecharging the amount of rent determined at a prior examination, withoutconducting a reexamination of tenant rent, is a positive determinationof tenant rent, and is grievable under the rule. The definition of what is grievable under the final rule covers both thePHA's determination of the tenant's rent and the PHA's determination ofcharges other than rent. Potentially, there are two types of issues concerningthe PHA determination of rent or charges. First, the tenant may questionwhether PHA has correctly computed the amount of the tenant rent or PHAcharge. For example the tenant may claim that the PHA has overstated familyincome, and that the tenant rent based on the family income should be lessthan the amount determined by the PHA. Second, the tenant may assert thatthe tenant owes less than the amount claimed by the PHA. The tenant mayassert that the tenant has already paid the amounts claimed by the PHA.Both types of issues are covered by the grievance process under the rule.(2) Need for Hearing on Determination of Rent. The amount of rent paidby a public housing tenant is determined by a statutory formula (U.S. HousingAct of 1937, section 3(a), 42 U.S.C. 1437a(a)). For most public housingtenants, the rent is 30 per cent of adjusted income. (The HUD regulationon how to determine tenant rent is 24 CFR Part 913.) Under HUD regulations,the total rent paid by the tenant (``total tenant payment'') includes anallowance (``utility allowance'') for a reasonable amount of utilitiesthat must be paid directly by the tenant to the utility supplier. The tenantmust pay the PHA the difference between the total rent and the utilityallowance. (The difference is called ``tenant rent''.)Under the rule, the tenant may ask for a grievance hearing to examine ifthe PHA has correctly computed the rent (but not to grieve the PHA's determinationof the utility allowances for the program; see section V.D.2.b of thisPreamble.) The hearing may also consider whether the tenant paid the rentdetermined by the PHA. Comment suggests that the PHA should not have to give a hearing on thePHA calculation of the amount of rent, or on the PHA's determination thatthe tenant has not paid the rent. Comment notes that the PHA rent calculationis based on information supplied by the tenant or on third party verification.If the tenant questions the calculation, the issue can be handled by thePHA's internal supervisory review. With respect to grievance on non-paymentof rent, comment states that non-payment is an objective and readily determinablefact. The hearing requirement gives a delinquent more time to pay thanother tenants, and results in loss of income to the PHA. HUD disagrees with the suggestion that non-payment of rent should not bea subject of the grievance process. There may be legitimate factual orlegal questions bearing on the correctness of the PHA's decision on theamount owed by a tenant.The final rule requires that the PHA grieve on the PHA's calculation ofthe amount of rent, or on the PHA's determination that the tenant has notpaid the rent. For both types of question, it is often easy to decide whetherthe PHA determination is correct. Review of the PHA determination is theproper office of the hearing process. The tenant may raise significantand legitimate questions. In the case of a rent determination, the tenantmay be able to show that the PHA misapplied HUD requirements for calculationof tenant rent to the information supplied by the tenant. In the case ofa PHA claim that the tenant has not paid the rent, the tenant may be ableto show that the PHA has not entered a tenant payment in the PHA books(e.g., by showing a receipt or check). If the tenant claim is frivolousor ill-founded, the claim may be quickly and readily rejected by the hearingofficer. The hearing process has a price. A hearing inevitably involves cost andadministrative effort for the PHA. However, PHA determinations that a tenantmust pay a specific amount of rent or charges to the PHA are clearly adverseto the tenant, and are properly identified in this rule as ``adverse actions''under the 1983 law. Rent and other charges by the PHA directly affect thepocketbook of the tenant. Because families in public housing are poor,a requirement for the tenant to pay a given amount has a more serious effecton the family budget than for a family of a higher income. Use of the hearing process may avoid the later need for eviction of thefamily. A tenant's non-payment of the amounts assessed by the PHA as rentor charges is one of the most common grounds for a termination of tenancyor eviction. If the hearing officer finds that the tenant is right, non-paymentis generally removed as a potential ground for termination. If the hearingofficer finds that the amount assessed by the PHA must be paid, then thetenant knows that the money must be paid.The final rule provides that the tenant may grieve on the PHA's determinationof the amount of rent that the tenant must pay the PHA (or the amount ofutility reimbursement by the PHA to the tenant) andSection; 966.31(a)(2)(iii)(A)).(3) Tenant Request to Change Rent or PHA Charges_<T3>(a) Submission of Request. </T3>When the PHA redetermines tenant rent,the PHA must give written notice of the new rent to the tenant (andSection;966.10(c)(2)). Similarly, the PHA must give written notice of any chargeswhich are not included in the rent (andSection; 966.10(e)(1)(ii)). The noticeinforms the tenant when the new rent or charge must be paid. After receiving notice of the rent or charge, the tenant may claim thatthe rent or charge is mistaken, and ask the PHA to change the determination.For example, if the PHA notifies the tenant of a charge for claimed damageto the unit, the tenant may assert that the unit was damaged because thePHA failed to perform required maintenance, and that the charge shouldbe removed. After the PHA receives the tenant's request to change rentor charges stated in a PHA notice, the PHA may grant or deny the requestedchange.The provisions of the proposed rule was intended to give the tenant theopportunity for a grievance hearing if the PHA denies a change in rentor charges when requested by the tenant. However, comment correctly notesthat there is a discrepancy between the proposed rule text and Preamble.In the Preamble, a PHA's proposed decision denying a request to modifythe PHA's determination of rent or PHA charges was included in the definitionof proposed adverse action. In the proposed rule text, however, adverseaction was defined as the PHA's proposed decision determining tenant rentor charges. Comment objects to defining adverse action as the refusal ofa family's request for modification of the PHA's determination or rentor tenant charges, rather than as the original imposition of the rent orcharge.In the final rule, HUD substantially follows the approach of the regulationtext in the proposed rule_the tenant may grieve the PHA's determinationof rent, or of PHA charges in addition to rent (andSection; 966.31(a)(2)(iii)).In this approach, there is a clearer distinction between definition ofthe cases when the tenant has the right to grieve (``proposed adverse action''),as against definition of the PHA's authority to establish the proceduresby which a tenant may exercise the right.HUD must issue regulations which require a public housing PHA to establishand implement an administrative grievance procedure for proposed adverseaction (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(k), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)). ThePHA grievance procedure may include rules on how and when the tenant mayexercise the right to a grievance hearing. The administrative grievanceprocedure may provide that a tenant who wants to challenge the PHA determinationin an administrative grievance hearing must first ask the PHA to changethe determination.The rule provides that a tenant's request to change the PHA determinationof rent or charges must be submitted in the form and manner prescribedin the PHA's administrative grievance procedure (andSection; 966.31(c)(1)(iv)).<T3>(b) Deadline for Requesting Change in Rent or Charges.</T3> The administrativegrievance procedure may provide that a request to change the PHA determinationof rent or charges must be submitted by a reasonable deadline as determinedby the PHA (andSection; 966.31(c)(1)(i)). Comment criticizes the absenceof a requirement to notify a tenant of the deadline to request a change.The PHA should give notice that the tenant will lose the right to a grievancehearing if the tenant misses the deadline.Comment asserts that the lack of notice violates due process. This assertiondoes not properly distinguish between the right to an administrative grievancehearing and the right to occupy the unit. The PHA may not repossess theunit unless the tenant has opportunity for a due process hearing to determinewhether there is good cause for termination of tenancy. A due process hearingmay take the form of a judicial process for eviction of the family. Ifthe tenant does not submit a timely request to change the PHA determination,the tenant loses the opportunity for an administrative grievance hearingbefore the PHA. The tenant does not lose the right or opportunity for adue process judicial hearing. If the PHA moves to terminate tenancy fornon-payment of the rent or charges determined by the PHA, the tenant maychallenge the determination in court.HUD agrees, however, that if the PHA wants to set a deadline for tenantto request a change in rent or charges, the PHA should give notice thatthe tenant will lose the opportunity for an administrative grievance hearingunless the tenant meets the PHA deadline. The final rule states (andSection;966.31(c)(1)) that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(i) The administrative grievance procedure may provide that a Tenantwho wants a change in the rent or charges determined by the PHA, as statedin the PHA notice of rent or charges, must ask the PHA to change the determinationby a reasonable deadline as determined by the PHA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) The PHA notice of rent or PHA charges must give notice of thedeadline. The time for the Tenant to ask for a change in the rent or chargesruns from the PHA notice of the deadline. The notice shall provide in substance:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) If the Tenant believes the proposed determination is not correct,the Tenant may ask the PHA to change the determination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) The deadline to ask for a change.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) The Tenant may ask for a grievance hearing on the proposed determination.If the Tenant misses the deadline to ask for a change, the Tenant losesthe right to a grievance hearing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) If the Tenant does not submit by the PHA deadline a requestto change the rent or PHA charges stated in the PHA notice of rent or charges,the Tenant loses the right to a hearing on the proposed determination,and the PHA is not required to give notice of proposed adverse action concerningthe determination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) A request to change a proposed determination of rent or PHA chargesshall be submitted in the form and manner prescribed in the PHA's administrativegrievance procedure.</ITAG>The rule does not require a PHA to establish a deadline for a tenant torequest a change in the PHA determination of rent or charges. The choiceis left to the management judgment of the individual PHA. (See also Preamble,section V.E.5, concerning establishment of a deadline for requesting ahearing.)(4) Notice of Rent or Charges. Comment argues that the original PHA notice,which informs the tenant of proposed rent or charges, should also advisethat the tenant may request modification of the proposed decision, andadvise that the tenant may ask for a grievance hearing if the modificationis denied. If a tenant does not ask the PHA to modify a decision that increasesrent or charges, the tenant will never get notice of the opportunity togrieve (notice of proposed adverse action). Comment claims that failureto inform the tenant that there is a process to dispute the adverse actionis a violation of due process (citing <T3>Memphis Light </T3>v. <T3>Craft,</T3> 436 U.S. 1(1978)).For the following reasons, the final rule does not require notificationof the right to request a modification, or of the opportunity to grieve,<T3>at the time the PHA gives original notice of rent or charges</T3>:<ITAG tagnum="15">_For the most part, the rent determination is_as PHAs point out_themechanical application of HUD requirements to information supplied by thetenant family. The suggested language tends to invite baseless requeststo change routine PHA determinations of family rent, or to grieve on thedeterminations. </ITAG>Answering a large number of ill-founded requests for modification or hearingon PHA rent determination may be a significant waste of administrativeresources and money. Under the rule, the PHA's notice of rent determinationstates that the tenant may ask for an explanation, but does not solicitor encourage the tenant to request change in the rent. If the tenant doesnot agree with the PHA explanation, the tenant may then request a grievancehearing. The use of this two-step procedure tends to minimize submissionof baseless tenant requests to modify the PHA rent determination. The PHAexplanation may convince the tenant that the rent has been correctly computed.Bundling additional information in a routine notice of the PHA determinationof rent or charges may blur the impact of the information. The tenant mayignore notice of the opportunity to seek modification and hearing if includedin the boilerplate of the annual rent determination notice. The informationmay have more impact if given by a separate notice of adverse action.The procedure suggested in the comment may sometimes induce frivolous andunsupported challenges to the PHA determination, and sometimes cause atenant to ignore real and substantial error in the PHA determination. <ITAG tagnum="15">_Not including the suggested language (tenant may request modification,and may obtain hearing) in the original notice of rent or charges doesnot limit the tenant's opportunity for a statutory grievance hearing. Thetenant does not lose the right to a hearing unless the PHA either (1) givesnotice of a deadline to ask for a change in the PHA determination, or (2)give notice of adverse action, which explains the PHA determination ofrent or charges and informs the tenant of the opportunity for a hearing.</ITAG>The tenant's right to a grievance hearing is wholly preserved until thetenant receives the prescribed PHA notice. On the other hand, acceleratingthe notice of adverse action accelerates also the point at which the tenantloses the right to grieve on the PHA determination.<ITAG tagnum="15">_In the public housing program, the PHA must give the tenant informationabout the PHA grievance procedure. The information includes a descriptionof the circumstances in which the PHA has to give a grievance hearing_suchas a dispute over the determination of rent or charges (see section V.E.2of this Preamble). This general information is disseminated to tenantswithout regard to a particular adverse action or occasion of dispute. </ITAG>In practice, tenants are well aware of the right to grieve_from informationcirculated by the PHA, and from prior personal experience, advice of legalaid or contact with other families. Since the tenant already has generalknowledge of the grievance procedure, there is less need to remind thetenant that there is a grievance procedure each time the PHA gives noticeof a determination of rent or charges. (By contrast, in the <T3>Memphis Light </T3>case cited in public comment the affected publicdid not know there was a procedure for protecting utility bills, a writtenaccount of the procedure was not accessible to the public, and the opportunityto invoke the procedure depended on word of mouth referral. In <T3>Memphis Light, </T3>utility service could be terminated for non-paymentof the utility bills without notice of the administrative procedure forchallenging the proposed determination (436 U.S. 1, 14 n. 14.))<ITAG tagnum="15">_In the case of a PHA's proposed determination of rent or charges,the PHA may not evict the tenant from the unit, for non-payment of therent or charges assessed by the PHA without the opportunity for a due processjudicial hearing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Due process does not require notice of hearing rights at the timeof the original notice of the PHA determination of rent or charges.

The balance of affected interests does not supporta claim that there is any due process right to notice of adverse actionwhen the PHA gives original notice of a proposed determination of rentor PHA charges.</ITAG>(5) Payment of Rent as Condition for Grievance Hearing_<T3>(a) General_(i) Regulation. </T3>The old rule provides that the PHAdoes not have to schedule a grievance hearing on the PHA determinationof tenant rent unless the tenant pays the PHA in escrow the amount of therent due on the first of the month before the ``act or failure to act''(e.g., a proposed rent increase) on which the tenant wants to grieve, andthen continues to pay the same monthly rent until the grievance is decided.If a tenant wants to challenge a rent increase determined at the annualreexamination, the tenant pays the pre-increase rent until the hearingofficer renders a decision on the grievance. The new rule (andSection; 966.31(d)) also allows the PHA to require paymentof tenant rent, as determined by the PHA, as a condition for granting thetenant a hearing to grieve on the rent. The tenant must pay the amountof rent due, and must continue to pay the rent promptly until the grievanceis decided (andSection; 966.31(d)(1)(i)). However, if the tenant disputesan increase in the rent, the tenant pays the pre-increase rent until thehearing officer renders a decision (andSection; 966.31(d)(1)(ii)). The effect of the new rule is broadly similar to the old rule. Under bothversions, a tenant who wants a grievance hearing to challenge a proposedincrease in the rent pays the pre-increase rent until the grievance isresolved. Except for an increase, the tenant must pay up rent due the PHApending completion of the grievance hearing. The new rule provides (andSection;966.31(d)(1)):<ITAG tagnum="21">(i) The Tenant may request a grievance hearing on a proposed adverseaction * * * concerning Tenant Rent * * *. Unless the Tenant has paid thePHA the full amount of the rent the Tenant owes, as determined by the PHA* * *, and continues to make such payments promptly until completion ofthe grievance hearing, the PHA is not required to commence or continuea grievance hearing concerning Tenant Rent. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) The Tenant may challenge an increase in the Tenant Rent as determinedby the PHA at reexamination. As a condition for obtaining a grievance hearingon the increase, the PHA may require the Tenant to pay the PHA the amountof the Tenant Rent in effect before the increase until completion of thegrievance hearing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) The Tenant may challenge the amount of a decrease in the Tenantrent as determined by the PHA at reexamination, or may challenge a determinationat reexamination that the Tenant Rent will not increase or decrease. Asa condition for obtaining a grievance hearing on the amount of Tenant Rent,the PHA may require the Tenant to pay the amount of the Tenant Rent, asdetermined by the PHA at reexamination, until completion of the hearing.</ITAG><T3>(ii) Interest of Tenant and PHA. </T3>Legal aid comment objects toallowing the PHA to require a tenant to pay rent as a prerequisite forgrievance on the rent. Comment objects to requiring payment of rent, torequiring payment of rent which is disputed, or to requiring payment ofback rent (accrued before the tenant seeks a hearing). On the other hand,PHA comment states that the tenant should not have the right to a hearingunless the tenant pays all disputed rent, including a rent increase determinedby the PHA.The purpose of the grievance hearing is to secure a decision on how muchthe tenant owes the PHA. In HUD's view, the question of when a PHA shouldbe allowed to make the tenant pay rent as a prerequisite for a grievancehearing, and how much, depends on a balance of interests.The tenant has an interest in securing a hearing on the issue, and in minimizingencumbrances on the opportunity for a hearing. A requirement to pay disputedrent, before the tenant has a hearing on whether the rent should be paid,is a burden for the tenant. The tenant must put up the disputed rent orgive up the opportunity for an administrative hearing.The PHA has an interest in prompt payment and collection of rents. Promotingthis end accords with statutory policy expressed in the U.S. Housing Actof 1937 (section 6(c)(4)(B), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(c)(4)(B)). Nonpayment of rentreduces amounts available for operation of the housing. Allowing the tenantto delay the payment of rent pending hearing diminishes the tenant's incentivefor prompt payment, and increases tenant delinquencies in payment of rent.<T3>(b) Payment of Disputed Rent. </T3>Legal aid comment asserts that thetenant should not be required to pay disputed rents until there is a decisionwhether the disputed amounts should be paid. The PHA can collect the amountsafter a hearing. If the PHA miscalculates rent, the tenant may not havethe money to pay the amount assessed by the PHA. Legal aid comment objectsto requiring the tenant to pay money tenant may not have, in order to geta hearing on whether tenant has it. If the tenant cannot pay the amountdemanded, the tenant is denied the right to grieve.PHA and NAHRO comment states that public housing residents should pay whateverrent or charges are assessed by the PHA. After a hearing decision, thePHA can retroactively adjust the amounts paid by the tenant.In the view of this Department, it is not true, as claimed by the legalaid comment, that the PHA can simply wait and later collect unpaid rentsafter a hearing decision is rendered. In many cases, the PHA will not beable to collect, or will not be able to collect the full amount owing.A PHA will have a harder time collecting a large amount than a small amount.A tenant will have more difficulty in paying amounts owed to the PHA thelarger the accumulated debt. During the hearing process, a tenant may vacatethe unit or may be evicted. It may then be too expensive or impracticalfor the PHA to find and collect from a tenant who no longer resides inthe housing. It is common sense that a delay in rent collection can reducethe amount that is ultimately collected. The collection loss because ofdelay in collection is more marked in a population of poor families.Any payment_including payment of the statutory rent_is a demand on limitedfamily resources. Many poor families will not have the financial disciplineto put away money to cover the accumulated rent debt that will be owingif the hearing officer sustains the PHA determination of rent owed by thetenant. A tenant may be able to make current monthly payment of the amountsclaimed by the PHA, and which the tenant wants to contest. If the tenantdoes not have to make disputed monthly rent payments during the hearingprocess, and if the hearing decision finally supports the PHA, the tenantmay not have money to pay the accumulated debt.Allowing the tenant an effective moratorium on payment of disputed amountsduring the hearing process encourages the tenant to run up a debt the tenantwill not be able to pay. If the tenant does not pay up back rent aftera hearing, the PHA is confronted with a hard choice between allowing thetenant to stay without payment, or evicting. Failure to evict a tenantwho does not pay will stimulate rent delinquency by other tenants. To preserverent collections, the PHA may be forced to evict. Permitting a tenant towithhold payment of disputed rent during the hearing process, buildingup an unpayable debt to the PHA, may finally lead to eviction of the tenant.Permitting withholding during hearing creates an incentive for mis-useof the hearing process. Tenants will be tempted to file grievances in orderto delay the payment of rent, not just to raise bona fide disputes overthe PHA rent calculation.<T3>(c) Payment of Increase or Decrease in Rent. </T3>At a reexamination,the rent may increase, decrease, or stay the same. Under the old rule,a tenant who wants to grieve the rent determined by the PHA at reexaminationcontinues to pay the same monthly rent as before the reexamination (``therent due and payable as of the month preceding the month in which the actor failure to act [the reexamination] took place'' (old rule andSection;966.55(e)), regardless of whether the change at reexamination is an increaseor a decrease of the prior rent. If the PHA has determined a lower rentat reexamination (because of a fall in family income), but the tenant allegesthat the decreased rent is still too high, the tenant would have to paythe old rent pending hearing, rather than the lower rent determined atreexamination.This rule provides that if the tenant challenges an <T3>increase </T3>in the rent at a reexamination, the tenant must pay thepre-increase rent until the issue is decided at hearing (andSection; 966.31(d)(1)(ii)).Otherwise the tenant must pay the rent determined by the PHA at the reexamination(andSection; 966.31(d)(1)(iii)). If the PHA decreases the rent, the tenantpays the decreased rent determined at reexamination. The tenant gets theimmediate benefit of the decreased rent initially determined by the PHA.Legal aid comment asserts that if the rent is decreased, and if the tenantchallenges the amount of the decrease, the tenant should only be requiredto pay the undisputed portion of rent. PHA and NAHRO comment argues thatpending outcome of a grievance hearing a tenant should have to pay whateverrent is determined by the PHA, including an increase. Allowing the tenantto pay the pre-increase rent gives the tenant an incentive to postponepayment of rent by filing a grievance. Consequently, this practice causesan increase in filed grievances, in tenant receivables, and in non-productiveuse of PHA staff.According to PHA comment, the greater the increase in rent, the more likelythat a tenant will initiate a request for a grievance hearing. A tenantwill face substantial payments if the tenant loses at the hearing. Allowingthe tenant to pay pre-increase rent causes hardship to a tenant who cannotpay accumulated back rent. Increased rent should be effective immediately,even if the tenant wants to grieve. If the grievance is upheld, the PHAcan grant a credit or refund to the family. HUD is impressed by the argument that allowing a tenant to hold back anypart of the rent produces an incentive to grieve for the sake of delayingpayment, and therefore an incentive for assertion of phony grievances.A PHA which delays collection of rents due from public housing familieswill suffer a collection loss because of the delay. Reducing pressure forpayment from a public housing tenant will affect collection of rent fromother tenants in the PHA's program. The authority for a tenant to postponepayment of rent during a grievance generates administrative burden forthe PHA in processing delinquencies and handling grievances. Permittinga tenant to put off payment of rent determined by the PHA can eventuallycause a hardship when the tenant must pay the accumulated rent. A postponementof collection may lead to eventual eviction of the family. In this final rule, the tenant is not required to pay a rent increase determinedby the PHA at reexamination in order to grieve on the PHA determination.Otherwise, the tenant must pay the amount determined by the PHA, even ifthe tenant seeks a reduction in the amount determined by the PHA. Thisposture is a reasonable balance of the interests affected. Respecting the desire of the PHAs for immediate collection of a rent increasedetermined at reexamination, we note that a PHA can attempt to acceleratethe grievance process in order to mimimize rent loss and other harmfuleffects. The PHA can set a deadline for requesting modification of therent determined by the PHA (andSection; 966.31(c)(l)(i)), or a deadline forseeking a grievance hearing after notice of adverse action (andSection; 966.31)(c)(2)).By moving up the point at which the PHA gives notice of adverse action,the PHA can also move up the time for the tenant to seek a grievance hearingon the adverse action, and the time for conducting the hearing.The PHA can give notice of adverse action (explaining the specific groundsfor the PHA rent redetermination) at the same time that the PHA gives noticeof the new rent redetermined by the PHA (andSection; 966.31(b)(2)(iii)).The PHA may be able to complete the grievance hearing before or soon afterthe scheduled effective date of reexamination, thus avoiding delay in thepoint at which the tenant must pay the rent increase determined by thePHA, but without compromising the right of the tenant to a grievance hearingon the PHA determination. Several factors tend to minimize the incentive for a tenant to abuse thegrievance process as an excuse for delaying payment of a rent increase.A tenant who holds back any part of the rent does not have a free ride.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>First, </T3>contrary to recommendations in legal aid comment, the ruledoes not prohibit the PHA from imposing late charges for a tenant who holdsback payment of a rent increase during the grievance process. If the hearingofficer sustains the increase, the tenant may have to pay additional chargesassessed because of the late payment of rent.<ITAG tagnum="15">_</ITAG><T3>Second, </T3>there is nothing that precludes the PHA from taking stepsto terminate the lease and evict the tenant for failing to pay the increasedrent determined by the PHA. If eviction is excluded from the PHA grievanceprocess, the PHA may bring the court action for dispossession, withoutany prior grievance hearing. Of course, the tenant can contest the PHA'srent determination in the State court eviction proceeding. HUD does not adopt the legal aid recommendation that a tenant should onlypay amounts which are undisputed. Under the final rule, a tenant who wantsthe opportunity for a hearing on a rent increase at reexamination mustat least continue to pay the rent the tenant was paying before the reexamination.Continunance of rent at the level previously determined (and on which thetenant had the prior opportunity to grieve) is not a new and unexpectedburden for the tenant. The legal aid position would effectively destroy the requirement for thetenant to pay rent as a condition for hearing. If a tenant does not haveto pay rent which is ``disputed'', the tenant has carte blanche to disputeany or all of the rent and to obtain a grievance hearing. Unlike the authorityto withhold an <T3>increase </T3>in the rent assessed by the PHA, there is no externalobjective criterion governing the amount that may be withheld. The tenantunilaterally decides what is to be disputed and withheld. If the tenant can hold back any portion of the rent, a tenant may be greatlytempted to raise insubstantial disputes for the sake of delaying the paymentof rent, and tempted to enlarge the portion of the rent which is ostensiblydisputed. The practice of withholding rent is likely to spread, as othertenants discover that rent payments can be disputed and postponed. Thethreat of late charge or eviction may not stem the flow of frivolous claims.Tenants may not appreciate the risks of PHA adverse action. If a tenantexpects to move from the unit before arrearage is collected, the tenantmay deliberately seek to string out the need for payment as long as possible.Open-ended withholding of rent by public housing tenants may dramaticallydamage PHA finances. Authority to withhold a rent increase is intrinsicallylimited to the amount of the increment over prior rent. By contrast, awithholding of all disputed amounts potentially reaches the PHA's wholestream of rental income. Any delay in collection of rent may harm the financialinterests of the PHA. The greater the amount that is withheld, the greaterthe potential damage to finances of the PHA. The U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (section 6(c)(4)(B), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(c)(4)(B))authorizes HUD to prescribe procedures and requirements for PHAs to establish:<ITAG tagnum="21">satisfactory procedures designed to assure the prompt payment andcollection of rents and the prompt processing of evictions in the caseof nonpayment of rent * * *.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The PHA should not be required to grieve on issues related to a PHAdetermination of tenant rent while the tenant is refusing to pay the rentin effect prior to the determination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>(d) Payment of Back Rent. </T3>Under the proposed rule, a family whichwants to grieve on the PHA rent determination must pay the full amount,as determined by the PHA, of the tenant rent due and payable by the family(except for a rent increase). Legal aid comment objects to imposing a requirementfor payment of back rent as a condition for hearing. Comment claims thatrequiring payment of back rent is objectionable if the tenant is disputingthe rent claimed by the PHA, and that the requirement violates both dueprocess and the statutory grievance right. Comment alleges that the burden on the tenant from requiring payment ofback rent is disproportionate to the benefit to the PHA. Comment assertsthat the PHA's sole interest is to assure that the grievance process doesn'tresult in financial detriment by accumulation of additional rent duringthe grievance process. The comment argues that if the PHA is conceded aright to demand payment of rent as a condition of hearing, the PHA shouldonly be allowed to require payment of rent accruing after the tenant'srequest for a hearing. Legal aid comment which objects to requiring payment of back rent alsoobjects to requiring payment of any disputed rent. Thus the PHA would onlybe allowed to require payment of rent which is undisputed, and which accruesafter the tenant's request for a grievance hearing. The PHA would not beallowed to collect back rent_even if the tenant's obligation to pay theback rent is undisputed_accrued before the tenant's request for a hearing.Comment also objects to allowing the PHA to impose any penalty for latepayment of rent, objects to imposing any deadline for requesting a grievance,objects to permitting the PHA to evict while the tenant is grieving thenonpayment of rent, objects to allowing a PHA to bypass the grievance processfor a termination of tenancy, and urges the adoption of elaborate grievanceprocedures that will afford the tenant ample opportunities to delay thehearing process.If adopted in tandem, the positions urged in legal aid comment will systematicallyencourage a tenant to withhold rent payable to the PHA, and to disputethe PHA's computation of the rent for the sake of enlarging the amountsthat may be safely withheld. Tenants will put off payment of rent to thelast possible moment, when the hearing officer has rendered a decision.The position advocated by comment is an invitation to financial disasterfor the PHA, and will undermine the encouragement of tenant responsibilityfor payment of rent.Comment states that the PHA should only be able to collect undisputed rentwhich accrues after the tenant requests a hearing. This approach allowsthe tenant to manipulate the amount which must be paid as a condition forhearing, by putting off the point at which a hearing is requested. Thetenant is offered an incentive to delay the hearing request as long aspossible, and thus to hold off the payment of rent. The proposal discouragesprompt payment of rent, and is contrary to the spirit of the statutorydirective to establish procedures designed to assure prompt payment andcollection of rent (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(c)(4)(B), 42 U.S.C.1437d(c)(4)(B)).Under the final rule, the amount of rent which must be paid by the tenantin order to get a hearing is not affected at all by the point at whichthe tenant decides to request a hearing. Whenever the tenant requests ahearing, the tenant must pay the amount due, as determined by the PHA.Thus the tenant has no reason to delay requesting a hearing, or to holdback the payment of rent. Instead, a tenant with a bona fide cause of grievancehas an incentive to have the grievance heard as soon as possible, so thatthe rent paid is reduced as soon as possible, upon a favorable resolutionof the grievance.The final rule provides that the tenant must pay the full amount owed,as determined by the PHA (except for a challenged increase in the rentas determined at reexamination). The tenant must pay back rent accruedbefore the tenant's request for a hearing.Comment acknowledges that the PHA has a financial interest in collectingamounts accrued during the hearing process, but claims that the PHA doesnot have a sufficient interest to justify requiring payment of back rentas a condition for hearing. HUD rejects the artificial distinction betweenthe PHA interest in collecting back rents, as against the PHA interestin collecting additional amounts that come due during the hearing process.The amounts owed by a tenant before the grievable event (proposed adverseaction), or before the tenant's request for a hearing, may exceed amountsthat accrue subsequently and prior to hearing.The PHA has a financial stake in collecting any amount that the tenantowes to the PHA. If the PHA does not collect rent promptly, rent revenueswill be lost. Requiring the tenant to pay rent as a condition for hearinghelps to maintain pressure for payment of rent. This proposition appliesequally to back rent, as to rents which accrue during the hearing process.<T3>(e) Legality and Constitutionality of Requiring Rent Payment as a Conditionfor Hearing. </T3>Comment claims that requiring the tenant to pay rentas a condition for hearing is unconstitutional, and deprives the tenantof the statutory right to a hearing under the 1983 law.Comment wrongly asserts that the requirement amounts to an unconstitutionalseizure of family property. In fact, however, no property is seized bythe PHA. The tenant either deposits the amounts required, or fails to makethe deposit. If the tenant fails to make the deposit, the tenant is notentitled to an administrative grievance hearing. The tenant does not losepossession of the money. The tenant loses the right to an administrativegrievance hearing on whether the money is owed to the PHA.Foreclosure of the right to an administrative grievance hearing beforethe PHA does not foreclose the opportunity for a hearing. If the tenantdoes not pay the rent, the PHA may bring a judicial action seeking repossessionof the unit, or seeking a judgment for amounts owed by the tenant. Therule does not authorize the PHA to seize a tenant's funds or other propertywithout the opportunity for hearing. To the contrary, the rule provides(andSection; 966.11) that the lease may not include provisions which wouldallow the PHA to take or hold family property without notice to the tenant,and a court decision on the rights of the parties. The right of the PHAto take money or other personal property of the tenant and household priorto judgment is governed by State law and State procedures for pre-judgmentseizure. Operation of the State law and procedures for pre-judgment seizuresis subject to Constitutional requirements. The HUD rule does not attemptto prescribe rules for pre-judgment attachment or other creditor remedies.The requirement to pay rent as a condition for an administrative hearingdoes not deny tenant the opportunity to grieve on a PHA adverse action.The payment of rent is merely a reasonable condition governing the tenant'saccess to the administrative grievance process. HUD has plain statutoryauthority to regulate the prerequisites and procedures for a grievancehearing (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(k), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k); HUDAct, section 7(d), 42 U.S.C. 3535(d)).Comment asserts that a requirement to escrow rent penalizes a tenant forexercising the right to a grievance hearing, and will chill tenant's exerciseof the grievance right. However, the tenant is required to pay the rentdetermined by the PHA whether or not the tenant seeks a hearing on thePHA determination. Payment of rent is not a special requirement or penaltyimposed on a tenant who wants a hearing, but is a regular incident of theassisted tenancy.The U.S. Supreme Court has specifically rejected the contention that arequirement to pay disputed rent pending hearing is a denial of due process.In <T3>Lindsey </T3>v. <T3>Normet, </T3>405 U.S. 56, 66-67, 92 S. Ct. 862, 870-71 (1972), tenantsclaimed a denial of due process of law:<ITAG tagnum="21">Because the rental payments are not suspended while the alleged wrongdoingsof the landlord are litigated. <T3>We see no Constitutional barrier to [the State's] insistance that thetenant provide for accruing rent pending judicial settlement of his disputeswith the lessor. </T3></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Supreme Court held that requiring a tenant to pay rent to obtaincontinuance of an eviction hearing is not irrational or oppressive (405U.S. at 56). In <T3>Head </T3>v. <T3>Jellico Housing Authority, </T3>Civ. No. 3-87-339 (E.D. Tenn, filedFebruary 17, 1988), the U.S. District Court rejects the claim of a publichousing tenant that a grievance hearing was improperly terminated becauseof tenant's failure to pay rent into an escrow account pursuant to theold lease and grievance rule. The District Court holds that a tenant maybe required to pay both disputed and undisputed rent into escrow as a conditionfor obtaining a grievance hearing. ``The failure to make escrow paymentterminates the grievance procedure and constitutes a waiver of the tenant'srights under the grievance procedure.'' In the <T3>Head </T3>case, the District Court also rejects tenant's contentionthat due process entitles the tenant to a hearing before the assessmentof public housing rent increases. The court states that ``the Fifth Amendmentdoes not require that public housing tenants be accorded an opportunityfor a due process hearing before their rents can be increased''. (f) <T3>Elimination of Requirement to Deposit Tenant Payments in Escrow.</T3>The old rule provided that tenant payments which are required as a conditionfor scheduling a grievance which involves the amount of rent must be depositedin an ``escrow account'' until the grievance is decided. The new rulesdoes not require the PHA to put the tenant payments in an ``escrow account''or require any special procedure for segregating or handling the moniespaid by the tenant. Of course, once the grievance is decided, the PHA will have to act in accordancewith the grievance decision, including a decision requiring the PHA torefund collected amounts in excess of the amounts owed by the tenant tothe PHA. (6) Grievances Other Than Disputes Over Rent_Requiring Payment as a Conditionfor Hearing_(a) <T3>Payment of Disputed Charges. </T3>The proposed rule would allow a PHAto require payment of rent as a condition for granting a hearing on thePHA's determination of rent. The Preamble noted that, as under the oldrule, this authority ``applies only to rent, not to the PHA's determinationrespecting other charges imposed on the family'' (51 FR 26518, 1st col.,July 23, 1986). Comment poses questions concerning authority of a PHA torequire some payment as a condition for hearing on matters other than rent.Comment states that the rule is not clear on whether a tenant must paydisputed PHA charges other than rent to get a hearing on the PHA's assessmentof the charges. Comment observes that payment of disputed charges willbe a hardship for the tenant. The final rule (andSection; 966.31(d)(2)) explicitlystates that the PHA may not require payment of charges as a condition forgranting a grievance hearing. The rule provides that: <ITAG tagnum="21">The PHA may not deny the opportunity for a grievance hearing on aproposed adverse action * * * concerning the PHA's proposed decision determiningthe amount of PHA charges in addition to rent, or the amount the Tenantowes the PHA for PHA charges in addition to rent, on the ground that theTenant has not paid the PHA the full amount, as determined by the PHA,of the charges the Tenant owes to the PHA. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This revision is in accordance with the old rule, and with the intentionof the proposed rule, as expressed in the Preamble. The rule does not treat PHA non-rent charges the same as rent. The PHAhas less interest in demanding payment of charges prior to hearing, thanin requiring payment of rent. First, the aggregate amount of regular rentcollections is ordinarily much greater than the aggregate amount of tenantcharges. For this reason, a delay in payment of tenant charges during thetime necessary for hearing will have a much less severe effect on the flowof revenues needed to operate public housing projects. Second, the PHA'sdetermination of charges other than rent is more likely to hinge on specialcircumstances, or legitimately disputable facts, than the PHA's routinedetermination of the rent. There is probably a considerably greater rateof error in determination of PHA charges, and consequently a greater likelihoodthat the charge will be reversed or denied at hearing. The tenant has thereforea greater interest in having the grievance heard before paying the amountdetermined by the PHA. (b) <T3>Grievance on Termination of Tenancy. </T3>PHA comment recommends thatthe requirement to pay rent as a condition for hearing should apply toa grievance on any termination of tenancy, not just to a grievance on paymentof rent. The PHA states that a tenant who wants to grieve on a terminationof tenancy should be required to remain current in rent, so that the grievanceprocess is not used to delay an inevitable eviction and provide free rentfor the tenant. The PHA recommendation is not adopted. The PHA's financial interests areadequately protected by requiring payment of rent determined by the PHAas a condition for a grievance hearing on the PHA's determination of therent. (7) Relation of Grievance on Non-payment of Rent to Administrative Hearingon Termination of Tenancy. The PHA determination of rent, or the PHA determinationto terminate tenancy or evict the occupants, are both subjects on whichthe PHA is required to grieve. Non-payment of rent is a common ground forthe PHA decision to evict. The tenant's grievance on the PHA's rent determinationmay turn on some of the same issues as a grievance on the PHA's decisionto terminate the tenancy for non-payment of rent, or as a judicial actionto evict for non-payment. Here we consider the relation between a tenant'sright to an <T3>administrative </T3>grievance hearing on rent and the right to an <T3>administrative </T3>grievance hearing on a termination of tenancy.Non-payment and termination are separate grievable subjects, but the regulationdoes not require duplicative grievance hearings on the same facts or issues.Issues concerning non-payment of rent may be heard in a grievance hearingprocess before or separate from a grievance hearing for termination oftenancy for non-payment. Alternatively, issues concerning non-payment andtermination may be bundled in a single hearing process, where the tenantchallenges the PHA's decision to terminate the tenancy for non-paymentof rent. Once resolved by decision of the PHA-hearing officer, issues concerningdetermination and payment of rent need not be reheard in a grievance hearingon termination of tenancy. If the PHA decides to terminate the assisted tenancy for non-payment ofrent previously determined by the PHA, the tenant's right to grieve onthe proposed decision to terminate does not enlarge the tenant's rightto grieve on the original determination of tenant rent. If the tenant doesnot request a grievance hearing by a deadline imposed by the PHA (andSection;966.31(c)(2)), the tenant loses the right to grieve on the PHA's determinationof rent. Once lost, the right to grieve on that issue is not restored bythe PHA's subsequent act to terminate the tenancy for non-payment of therent so determined. The tenant may grieve the fact of non-payment, or theexistence of legal grounds for termination because of the non-payment.However, in the hearing on termination of tenancy, the tenant is not entitledto re-open the barred issues concerning correctness of the PHA rent determination.The procedure for handling overlapping grievance issues may be regulatedin the grievance procedures adopted by a PHA. The power of the hearingofficer to manage the conduct of the grievance hearing under the PHA grievanceprocedure may encompass the power to decide how different grievable issuesmay be fairly and efficiently heard.<T3>f. Requiring Tenant to Move. </T3>In certain circumstances, the tenantmust move to another public housing until when requested by the PHA (andSection;966.10(h)(1)(v); see discussion at section III.I of this Preamble). Therule provides that the PHA's decision requiring the tenant to transferto another dwelling unit is an adverse action_that is, a subject on whichthe PHA is required to grieve (andSection; 966.31(a)(2)(ii)). The PHA's decisionto move the tenant does not terminate public housing assistance on behalfof the tenant. Nevertheless, the decision so directly affects the tenant'ssecurity of occupancy that the proposed decision is treated as a proposedadverse action.If a PHA has properly excluded eviction from the PHA grievance process,the PHA may bring action for eviction without a prior grievance hearing(see Preamble, section VI.D.5). After a State court decision that a tenantmay be evicted, the PHA will ordinarily take whatever action is necessaryto force the tenant and other occupants to move from the unit in accordancewith State law. PHA and NAHRO comment requests clarification that the PHAdoes not have to give a grievance hearing when the tenant is forced tomove pursuant to the court decision in the eviction proceeding. The finalrule clarifies, as originally intended, that the PHA is obliged to grievewhen the PHA decides to require the tenant to move <T3>to another dwelling unit </T3>(andSection; 966.31(a)(2)(ii), cf. alsosection III.I of this Preamble). Conversely, however, the PHA is not obligated to grieve if eviction isproperly excluded from the PHA grievance process, and the PHA takes actionto execute a judicial decision which allows the PHA to evict the tenantfrom the unit in accordance with eviction process under State or locallaw. The statute and rule allow exclusion of ``eviction'' from the PHAgrievance process. ``Eviction'' is defined as ``forcing the occupants <T3>to move out </T3>of the dwelling unit'' (andSection; 966.2). Once thelandlord-tenant court decides that the PHA may evict the occupants, thePHA may proceed with the eviction_that is may force the occupants to move.Since eviction is excluded from the grievance process, the PHA has no obligationto provide any further opportunity for a grievance hearing on the eviction.C. Who May Grieve?The 1983 law requires the PHA to establish a grievance procedure in which``tenants'' have the opportunity to be heard in an administrative grievancehearing on proposed adverse action (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(k);42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)). However, grievance requirements in the proposed rulewere vested in the ``family'', thus leaving room for the PHA to determinein its grievance procedures how the family will exercise the grievanceright, and through which family members.The final rule specifies that the right to grieve rests with the ``tenant'',the member of the assisted family who leases the unit from the PHA. Referencesto ``family'' in the proposed grievance regulations are systematicallyreplaced by references to the ``tenant''. This revision assures that thePHA grievance procedure places the grievance right in the tenant, in accordancewith the literal terms of the 1983 law. The revision also removes ambiguityas to who holds rights under the grievance procedure. For example, therevision makes clear that the PHA's notice of the grounds for proposedadverse action must be directed to the ``tenant'', as required under the1983 law (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(k)(1), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)(1);section 966.31(b)).The change in the grievance procedure is parallel to changes in the statementof regulatory lease requirements. As under the PHA grievance procedure,the ``tenant'' is the subject of all rights under the lease.D. Purpose of Hearing on Proposed PHA Adverse Action <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Regulation Provisions</ITAG>The hearing process under section 6(k) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937is intended to assure that decisions by the PHA with respect to an individualtenant comply with applicable rules. The hearing process does not displacethe regular PHA administrative process for matters committed to PHA discretionand management judgment. The rule states that the purpose of the hearingon a proposed PHA adverse action ``shall be to review whether the proposedadverse action by the PHA is in accordance with the lease, or with law,HUD regulations or PHA rules'' (andSection; 966.31(a)(3)(i)).The concept of adverse action, and the requirement for hearings on a proposedadverse action, apply only to proposed decisions by the PHA ``concerningan individual Tenant'' (andSection; 966.31(a)(2)). The rule provides (andSection;966.31(a)(3)(ii)) that:<ITAG tagnum="21">``PHA action or non-action concerning general policy issues or classgrievances (including determination of the PHA's schedules of allowancesfor PHA-furnished utilities or of allowances for Tenant-purchased utilities)does not constitute adverse action by the PHA, and the PHA is not requiredto provide the opportunity for a hearing to consider such issues or grievances.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Response to Comment</ITAG><T3>a. Exclusion of Policy Issues and Class Grievances From Hearing Process.</T3>Some comment agrees with HUD that the rule should include an explicitand unequivocal statement describing the purpose of a grievance hearing.The wisdom or appropriateness of policy, rule, regulation or law are notat issue in the hearing. Other comment argues that the grievance hearingshould be used for policy issues and class grievances, since these questionsaffect a whole class of residents. Where many tenants have disputes whichaffect each tenant individually, but in roughly the same manner, it ismore efficient to handle disputes on a class action basis.The exclusion of class grievances and policy issues in this rule is essentiallysimilar to the old lease and grievance rule. Although the old rule allowedthe tenant to grieve on almost any manner of individual dispute with thePHA, the grievance process was only a forum for determination of individualgrievances. (See especially andSection; 966.51(b) of the old rule.) The SupremeCourt has noted that public housing grievance procedures'' * * * are opento individual grievances but not to class actions'' (<T3>Wright </T3>v. <T3>Roanoke, </T3>479 U.S. <T2>XX</T2>, <T2>XX</T2>, 107 S. Ct. 766, 772 (1987)). The Supreme Court also statedthat the local PHA grievance processes required under the U.S. HousingAct of 1937'' * * * are not open to class grievances * * *.'' (<T3>Wright </T3>v. <T3>Roanoke, </T3>479 U.S. at <T2>XX</T2>, 107 S. Ct. at 773 (1987)).The 1983 statute requires a PHA to establish and implement an administrativegrievance process for proposed adverse action against a tenant. The lawwas intended to open a forum to resolve issues raised by individualizedPHA action concerning the individual tenant. The law was not intended toconvert the administrative grievance process into a forum for resolutionof broad class and policy grievances. Comment which proposes that the grievance process should be a vehicle fordecision on class issues is plainly motivated by the desire to maximizethe capacity to mount broad challenges to PHA decision and PHA authority.Those who attack PHA determinations would have a greater power to overturnPHA actions with a minimum expenditure of resources and funds, in particularwith a minimum use of available legal aid resources.The proposed change, as proposed by such comment, in the purpose of thegrievance process would, however, diminish the authority and discretionof the PHA to manage the public housing program. The proposed change wouldvery greatly increase the risk of major distortion and damage in administrationof the PHA program. The PHA should instead retain management authorityto develop appropriate local procedures to handle class and policy issues.In the case of policy issues, there is no governing legal rule, and theauthority for management decisions should rest with project management(including authority of a resident management corporation under section20 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as added by section 122 of the Housingand Community Development Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-242, February 5, 1988).The authority to decide policy for management of public housing shouldnot be transferred to a hearing officer. The hearing officer does not haveongoing responsibility for project management. In the case of legal issues,a question which could affect many tenants can be considered and testedin a hearing for a single tenant.A PHA has the freedom to develop a variety of local procedures to handlelegal or policy issues that affect tenants as a whole, or large groupsof tenants. The PHA may elect to assign issues for decision by tenant management,or may develop procedures for submission and consideration of public andtenant views. This rule should not divest the PHAs of local autonomy towork out different kinds of processes for determination of different kindsof issues. HUD will not force PHAs to resolve class and policy issues througha forum designed for the resolution of particular legal disputes betweenthe tenant and the PHA.<T3>b. Tenant Allowance for Utilities.</T3> The rule provides (andSection;966.31(a)(3)(ii)) that the grievance process does not apply to the PHA'sdetermination of the schedule of allowances for utilities (including allowancesfor Tenant-purchased or PHA-furnished utilities). Comment asserts thatthere is no basis for excluding determination of utility allowances fromthe grievance process, and that the exclusion will lead to avoidable litigation.A PHA determination of utility allowances for the public housing programis a technical determination by PHA management, based on the pattern ofutility costs and consumption in the PHA jurisdiction (see Part 965, SubpartE). This process is and should be different from the process for determiningwhether the PHA has violated some law or rule respecting the individualtenant, such as a determination whether the PHA made a mistake in determiningfamily income, or in computing rent based on the family income. HUD regulationsestablish a separate procedure specially designed for the determinationof utility allowances, and for soliciting tenant comments on the determinations(andSection; 965.473). The Supreme Court has noted HUD's consistent historicalposition that the grievance procedures do not apply to determination ofa PHA's utility allowance schedule (<T3>Wright v. Roanoke,</T3> 479 U.S. <T2>XX</T2>, <T2>XX</T2>, 107 S. Ct. 766, 773 n. 8 (1987)). The Supreme Court held thata tenant has an enforceable right to a reasonable utility allowance, andmay bring a judicial action to enforce the right under 42 U.S.C. 1983.E. Hearing Procedure<ITAG tagnum="81">1. General_Administrative Grievance Procedure</ITAG>The 1983 law states requirements for a hearing on proposed adverse action(section 6(k) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)). Thestatute does not, however, incorporate the procedural details of the oldlease and grievance rule. The new rule requires the PHA to establish ahearing procedure which complies with the basic elements described in the1983 law.The rule provides (andSection; 966.30(b)) that the PHA must establish andimplement an administrative grievance procedure for any proposed adverseaction. The PHA is required to adopt a written administrative grievanceprocedure in accordance with HUD requirements (andSection; 966.30(c)).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Information for Tenant_General Description of PHA Grievance Procedure</ITAG>The rule provides that the PHA must give each tenant in the PHA's publichousing program a ``general written description'' of the nature and coverageof the administrative grievance procedure, including a description of thecircumstances when the PHA must give the opportunity for an informal hearing,and how to request a hearing (andSection; 966.30(d)(1)). The text of theadministrative grievance procedure must be made available for inspectionand copying by any tenant (andSection; 966.30(d)(2)).A legal aid office commends the requirement that a PHA must adopt a writtengrievance procedure, must provide the family a general written descriptionof the procedure, and must make the procedure available for inspectionby the family.PHA comment states that the PHA should not be required to furnish everyfamily a copy of the PHA administrative grievance procedure, or a generaldescription of the grievance procedure. Furnishing the grievance procedureto every family is an administrative and financial burden. A copy of theprocedure should only be given to a family in danger of adverse action,or in case of a formal hearing, or only at the time a unit is leased tothe family. PHA comment states that posting on the PHA office bulletinboard is sufficient notice of grievance requirements.PHA comment reflects a misreading of the requirement to give the tenanta ``general written description'' of the PHA's grievance procedures. Therule does not require the PHA to give every public housing tenant a copyof the PHA ``administrative grievance procedure'', i.e., the full textof the grievance procedure adopted by the PHA, in advance of a concretegrievance or at any other time. Rather, the rule appropriately distinguishesbetween the types of information the tenant needs at different stages,so that the tenant can understand and invoke the right to a hearing underthe PHA grievance procedure. Consequently, the rule distinguishes betweenthree classes of communication by the PHA to the tenant about the administrativegrievance procedure:_A ``general written description'' of the grievance procedure (andSection;966.30(d)(1)). The general description is given to every tenant in thePHA public housing program._The ``administrative grievance procedure'' adopted by the PHA (andSection;966.30(d)(2)). The tenant can inspect or copy the procedure at any time._The ``notice of proposed adverse action'' which informs a particular tenantthat the PHA intends to take specific adverse action affecting the tenant(andSection; 966.31(b)). The notice informs the tenant of the reasons forthe proposed action. The notice also tells the tenant about the opportunityfor a hearing, and tells the tenant how to request a hearing.The ``general description'' gives the tenant a broad understanding of howthe grievance process works, and when the tenant has the right to a grievancehearing. The description must be given to every tenant, even if there isno concrete dispute or expectation of dispute between the tenant and thePHA.The general description should be drafted in clear and simple language.If the tenant wants more detailed information, the tenant can examine thePHA administrative grievance procedure. Under the rule, the individualPHA will be able to develop and use general description literature, suchas a brief pamphlet or booklet, that briefly and effectively communicatesto public housing tenants the basic elements of a tenant's right to a grievancehearing.The requirement to distribute a general description to every tenant inthe PHA public housing program poses a reasonable administrative burdenfor the PHA. The requirement is an important link in implementation ofthe PHA's grievance obligation under the 1983 law. Together with the tenant'sright to full examination of the PHA grievance procedure, and the rightto notice of specific adverse action respecting the tenant, the generaldescription helps the tenant know how and when to exercise the right toa grievance hearing on PHA adverse action.The rule does not require the PHA to give the general description to atenant on repeated occasions, or at any particular time. The requirementis satisfied by giving the general description only one time, such as atthe time a tenant is first admitted to the PHA's public housing program.The PHA could give the general description at the time of initial lease-upto a tenant, as recommended by PHA comment. The PHA does not have to repeator supplement the general description first provided to a tenant, unlessthere are changes in the PHA's administrative procedure which change elementsdescribed in the original general description given to the tenant. Forexample, there could be a change in the procedure for requesting a hearingdescribed in the original notice to the tenant. If so, the PHA must givethe tenant general information on the PHA's currently operative procedureto request a hearing.HUD expects that most PHAs will give a tenant the general description ofthe PHA grievance procedure at the time of some other regular communicationby the PHA with the tenant. This practice minimizes the PHA's administrativeburden. For example, the general description can be handed to a tenantwhen the tenant is admitted to the PHA public housing program, togetherwith other orientation materials for new participants. For tenants alreadyadmitted to the PHA's public housing program, the general description canbe give to each tenant at the annual reexamination (when the PHA must communicatewith the tenant about family income and composition, and about the PHA'sdetermination of the tenant rent). Comment suggests that the tenant should be given a form for requestinga hearing at the time of annual reexamination. Comment remarks that thereasons for a hearing must be clearly defined, to prevent nuisance grievances.The suggestion is not adopted. For easy administration of the grievancerequirement, a PHA may elect to develop a form to be submitted by a tenantwho wants a grievance hearing. The HUD regulations establish minimum requirementsfor the PHA administrative grievance procedure. The PHA will have broadauthority to work out the details of the local grievance process. HUD willnot mandate the use of grievance forms, and will not require that grievanceforms be distributed at specified times.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Notice of Proposed Adverse Action</ITAG><T3>a. Requirement for Notice_Statute and Rule. </T3>Section 6(k)(1) ofthe U.S. Housing Act of 1937 provides that a tenant must ``be advised ofthe specific grounds'' of a proposed adverse action by the PHA (42 U.S.C.1437d(k)(1)). Notice of the proposed action is also necessary to give thetenant an actual opportunity to request a hearing under the PHA grievanceprocedure.The rule provides (andSection; 966.31(b)(1)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The PHA shall give the Tenant written notice of a proposed adverseaction. The notice shall:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Contain a specific statement which describes the proposed adverseaction, and the reasons for the proposed adverse action.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) State that the Tenant may request a hearing under the PHA's administrativegrievance procedure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) State how to request a hearing, and the deadline for requestinga hearing.</ITAG><T3>b. When PHA Gives Notice of Adverse Action_</T3>(1) Termination ofTenancy. The final rule adds new language providing that occupants maynot be evicted until the PHA has given the tenant notice of proposed adverseaction (new andSection; 966.31(b)(2)(i)(A)) (unless eviction is excludedfrom the PHA grievance process). The rule also provides (andSection; 966.31(e)(1)(ii)):<ITAG tagnum="21">If the Tenant makes a timely request for a hearing on a proposed decisionto terminate the tenancy or to evict the occupants * * * the occupantsshall not be evicted from the dwelling unit before completion of the PHAgrievance hearing.</ITAG>If the PHA terminates the lease, the notice of adverse action must be givenbefore or combined with the notice of lease termination (andSection; 966.31(b)(2)(i)(B)).This procedure is designed to allow time for a hearing within the periodof the statutory notice of lease termination. The 1983 law provides thattenants must have an opportunity for a grievance hearing within the periodof the applicable notice of lease termination (U.S. Housing Act of 1937,section 6(k)(2), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)(2)).If a tenant is given notice of adverse action, and makes timely requestfor a grievance hearing, it is possible that the grievance hearing maynot be completed before expiration of the notice of lease termination (e.g.,fourteen days notice for non-payment of rent). The rule therefore provides(andSection; 966.31(e)(1)(i)):<ITAG tagnum="21">For a proposed termination of the lease by the PHA, or a proposedPHA decision not to renew the lease at the end of the lease term, the leaseshall not terminate before completion of the PHA grievance hearing.</ITAG>For a proposed decision to evict the family from the dwelling unit afterthe end of the lease term, the statute and rule do not specify any minimumperiod of notice (from service of the notice of adverse action to commencementof the eviction proceeding). However, a tenant who makes a timely requestfor a grievance hearing after receiving notice of adverse action may notbe evicted before completion of the hearing (andSection; 966.31(e)(1)(ii)).(2) Requiring Tenant to Move. A decision by the PHA to make the tenanttransfer from one public housing unit to another is an adverse action.The rule provides (andSection; 966.31(b)(2)(ii)):<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * the Tenant may not be required to move until the PHA has giventhe Tenant notice of proposed adverse action. If the Tenant makes a timelyrequest for a hearing on the proposed decision, the Tenant may not be requiredto move until Tenant is given the opportunity for a grievance hearing.</ITAG>Comment notes that a tenant should not be required to move to another publichousing unit until the PHA gives notice of adverse action, and until thegrievance hearing is completed. Both of these elements were already includedin the proposed rule. No revision is required.Comment states that the PHA should be required to give notice to the familyat least thirty days prior to move (with additional time for mailing).HUD finds no need to impose a special notice period for this purpose. Ifa tenant refuses to transfer to another unit, the PHA may terminate thelease on the original unit. If so, the PHA must give thirty days noticeof the lease termination (for grounds other than health or safety or non-paymentof rent) (andSection; 966.22(a)). The PHA must also give notice of this proposedadverse action to terminate the lease, and this notice must be given nolater than service of the notice of lease termination (andSection; 966.31(b)(2)(i)(B)and andSection; 966.22(d)(3)). The result is to effectively require noticeof adverse action at least thirty days before termination of the lease.In addition, the rule provides that a tenant is not obligated to move untilthe tenant has the opportunity for a grievance hearing (andSection; 966.31(b)(2)(ii)).To avoid delay, the PHA may give a combined notice of proposed adverseaction: (1) Requiring the tenant to move to another dwelling unit, and(2) terminating the lease for this reason. The notice of adverse actionmay be combined with the thirty day notice of lease termination. (3) Rent or Charges. A PHA determination of rent or PHA charges is an adverseaction. The rule provides that the PHA may give notice of proposed adverseaction when the PHA gives the tenant notice of a proposed decision determiningrent or charges (andSection;966.31(b)(2)(iii)). The tenant may request a change in rent or charges determined by the PHA(see andSection;966.31(c)(1)). The rule provides that the PHA must give noticeof adverse action no later than the time when the PHA denies the tenant'srequest for a change of the PHA's proposed determination of rent or charges(andSection;966.31(b)(2)(iii). (4) Other Adverse Action. Under the final rule, ``adverse action'' includesother specific, concrete and affirmative individualized action contraryto the interests of a tenant (andSection;966.31(a)(2)(iv)). For such otheradverse action, the final rule provides that the PHA must give notice ofadverse action to the tenant at a time that gives the tenant the opportunityfor a grievance hearing before the action is taken (andSection;966.31(b)(2)(iv)).C. Reasons for Adverse Action. The rule provides that the notice of adverseaction must contain ``a specific statement which describes * * * the reasons''for a proposed adverse action (andSection;966.31(b)(1)(i)). The provisionimplements the requirement in the 1983 law that tenants must be advisedof the ``specific grounds'' for a proposed adverse action (U.S. HousingAct of 1937, section 6(k)(1), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)(1)). The provision in the final rule is substantively identical to the provisionas proposed, but substitutes reference to ``reasons'' for proposed adverseaction in place of the prior reference to ``grounds'' for such action.Although ``grounds'' is the statutory term, ``reasons'' is a more colloquialand less legalistic way of expressing the same idea. In addition, the changeconforms with the regulation provisions concerning a notice of lease termination(stating ``reasons'' for lease termination); and concerning a hearing decision(stating ``reasons'' for the decision). Comment recommends that the regulation require a fuller statement of thebasis for adverse action. Comment states that the notice should includea statement of facts and the sources of facts, that the notice should statespecific grounds for adverse action, and that the PHA notice should provideclear and precise notice to the tenant. HUD has not made any change in response to such comment. The rule as promulgatedrequires that the notice of adverse action must contain a ``specific statement''which describes the reasons for the proposed PHA action. A notice conformingto this standard affords clear and precise notice to the tenant, so thatthe tenant can decide whether to request a grievance hearing on the PHAadverse action. After receiving the notice, the tenant will know what wasdecided and why. In the grievance hearing, the tenant can effectively pursueredress of the grievance. The notice of adverse action is not the sole source of information availableto the tenant so that the tenant can prepare for a hearing. In most cases,the tenant had direct and personal knowledge of the matters to be decidedat hearing, e.g., respecting family income or family conduct. In addition,the tenant has a right of access to relevant documents in the possessionor control of the PHA andSection;966.32(d)). The notice of adverse actionis a statement of the specific reasons for the proposed PHA determination.The notice gives the tenant sufficient information so that the tenant can_iftenant wishes_exercise the right to an informal grievance hearing beforethe PHA. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Procedure To Request Hearing </ITAG>Comment states that the notice of adverse action should include a formfor requesting the hearing. The PHA should be required to accept an oralrequest for hearing unless the PHA supplies a form to the tenant. HUD hasnot adopted these recommendations. There is no need for HUD to minutelydictate details of the local grievance process. A requirement for the tenant to submit a grievance form or other writtenrequest to grieve may offer significant advantages for the PHA and thetenant. A requirement for some written submission, or for submission ina prescribed form, tends to minimize issues as to whether the tenant requesteda grievance before the PHA deadline. A standard grievance form may helpthe tenant exercise the right to grieve. Use of a grievance form may alsohelp the PHA, since grievance requests will be submitted in a common format,and my be easier to process. Some public housing tenants may not know howto fill out a grievance form. However, the tenant may be able to get assistance,for example from PHA counselors, tenant organizations or local legal aid.A PHA can develop techniques for handling the grievance request. The PHAcan best work out procedures to fit the local situation. There is no compellingreason to prescribe or prohibit a requirement for the tenant to requesta hearing in writing, or on a form supplied by the PHA. Comment states that the notice of adverse action should specify the PHAdeadline, and the procedure for requesting a hearing. HUD agrees. The rulestates that the notice must state ``how to request a hearing, and the deadlinefor requesting a hearing'' (andSection;966.31(b)(1)(iii)). The tenant's opportunityto grieve is assured by requiring the PHA to first give the tenant a generaldescription of the grievance process, and then a notice of adverse actionthat also tells the tenant how to request a hearing. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Deadline to Request Hearing </ITAG>a. Statute and Rule_Authority to Establish Deadline. The 1983 law directsHUD to promulgate regulations which require each PHA to establish and implementan administrative grievance procedure which gives a tenant an opportunityfor a grievance hearing ``upon timely request'' (U.S. Housing Act of 1937,section 6(k)(2), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)(2)). The PHA may set a deadline forthe tenant to request a hearing. The PHA must grieve on a proposed adverseaction if the tenant submits a ``timely request'' for a hearing. Conversely,the PHA has no statutory duty to grieve if the tenant does not submit atimely request. The time for a tenant to submit the request for hearing is determined bythe administrative grievance procedure adopted by the PHA in compliancewith the statute. A tenant who misses the deadline for timely submissionof a grievance request under the PHA grievance procedure loses the statutoryright to grieve. The rule provides (andSection;966.31(c)(2)):<ITAG tagnum="21">(i) The PHA administrative grievance procedure may provide that theTenant must request a hearing by a reasonable deadline as determined bythe PHA.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) The PHA may establish different rules for determining the deadlinefor requesting a hearing in different circumstances, or for different typesof grievance. The deadline for the Tenant to request a hearing shall bestated in the notice of proposed adverse action. The PHA administrativegrievance procedure may provide that the PHA may grant a Tenant an exceptionfrom the deadline if the PHA determines that the exception is justifiedby individual circumstances.</ITAG>b. Reason for Establishing Deadline. The proposed rule provided that thenotice of adverse action must state how the family can request a hearing,and the ``time by which'' the request must be made. Comment objects toallowing the PHA to establish any maximum period (deadline) for a tenantto request a hearing in cases other than eviction. Comment claims thatthe PHA does not have a sufficient interest to justify establishing a deadlinein non-eviction cases. Problems can be rectified through the grievanceprocess. The establishment of strict deadlines forces the tenant into courtfor resolution of a grievance. The PHA has a powerful management interest in having a right to definethe time by which a tenant must exercise the right to grieve on an adverseaction. For all types of adverse action, the fixing of a deadline to grievemeans that the PHA knows when the right to grieve is exhausted, and thePHA can go forward with appropriate management action on that basis. Absenta deadline, legitimate PHA management actions and decisions may be interruptedor upset at any time by tenant's belated exercise of the opportunity togrieve. The PHA may be compelled to reverse or halt management actionsin progress pending completion of the grievance hearing, or as a resultof the grievance decision. The point of the statutory opportunity to grieve is to give the tenanta fair chance to be heard on a proposed PHA decision, not to permit thetenant an open-ended right to seek a grievance hearing at the tenant'sleisure. The statutory scheme explicitly contemplates that the PHA shouldonly be required to grieve upon a ``timely request'' by the tenant. Thestatute thus recognizes the interest of the PHA and the public housingprogram in establishing a time limit for submission of a request to grieve.When the PHA determines rent or charges, the PHA should be able to confrontpoints of dispute when issues are fresh. Passage of time may also compoundpoints at issue between the tenant and the PHA, for example, by addingsubsequent disputes on non-payment (or other questions) to an originalissue concerning computation of the tenant rent at reexamination. If thetenant does not timely exercise the right to grieve on the determinationof rent at annual reexamination, the PHA may cut off the right to grieveon that subject. After expiration of the deadline to grieve on the PHArent determination, the PHA knows that the tenant may not thereafter seeka grievance hearing on that issue. If the tenant fails to pay the redeterminedrent, the PHA may terminate the tenancy for non-payment of rent, but isnot obliged to grant an administrative grievance hearing on the PHA's determinationor rent. When the tenant is asked to transfer to another public housing unit, thePHA needs to know if the tenant is going to dispute the move. If the moveis not disputed (i.e., the tenant does not submit a request for grievanceby the deadline stated in the notice of adverse action) the PHA may proceedon the assumption that a new unit must be prepared and available for occupancyby the tenant, and that the tenant's original unit will be available foroccupancy by another program family. In the case of a grievance on the PHA's proposed termination of the lease,the law (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(k)(2)) provides that a tenantmust be given the opportunity for a hearing upon ``timely request [by thetenant] within any period applicable [for giving a notice of lease terminationas required under the 1983 law (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(l)(3),42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(3)]''. To assure this opportunity, the rule providesthat the notice of adverse action must be served with or before the leasetermination notice (andSection; 966.31(b)(2)(i)(B)). The PHA may establisha deadline for requesting a hearing on the PHA's proposed decision to terminatethe lease and evict the family. After the deadline has run, the PHA canfreely proceed with the eviction action. The proposed rule provided that the notice of adverse action must statethe ``time by which'' a family must request a hearing. The final rule refersinstead to a ``deadline'' for requesting a hearing. This is merely an editorialchange. The ``deadline'' is the ``time by which'' the tenant must submitthe request_the end of the period during which the tenant can ask for ahearing. A notice of adverse action states the deadline by which the tenant mustrequest a hearing. A tenant loses the right to a hearing on the PHA determinationof rent or charges if the tenant either (1) does not ask for a change inthe determination before the deadline recited in PHA notice of the determination(andSection; 966.31(c)(1)); or (2) does not ask for a hearing by the deadlinerecited in a notice of adverse action (which states the grounds for thedetermination, and advises the tenant of the opportunity for a grievancehearing) (see andSection; 966.31(c)(2)).<T3>c. Setting Deadline. </T3>Comment contends that under the statute,the tenant may request a hearing at any time within the period of the leasetermination notice. Under this reading of the 1983 law, the tenant mayelect to request a hearing at the very end of the lease termination noticeperiod. This reading of the law would pyramid the lease termination noticeand the period needed to complete the grievance at the tenant's request,thus delaying the lease termination until both periods have run. For example,if the PHA is required to give a thirty day lease termination notice, therequest to grieve is submitted on the last day of the thirty day period,and the grievance process consumes fifteen days, the period for lease terminationis effectively extended to forty five days (thirty days plus fifteen days).HUD does not agree with this reading of the statute. Under the languageof the statute, the tenant request must be submitted ``timely'', as wellas within the period of the lease termination notice. The requirement for``timely'' submission of the grievance request is a separate element ofthe right to grieve pursuant to the 1983 law (and applies to grievanceson any type of adverse action, not only a grievance relating to terminationof the lease).Comment objects that the rule does not set any minimum period for the tenantto ask for a hearing. Comment claims that a PHA can nullify the opportunityfor a hearing by setting short and unrealistic time frames for requestinga grievance. The regulation should prohibit use of unreasonable limits.After receipt of the PHA notice, the tenant should have at least ten orfifteen days to request a grievance hearing. The rule should either specifyminimum periods, or should establish a regulatory standard by which thePHA deadline can be measured. HUD has not adopted the recommendation to set a specific minimum periodfor submission of the tenant grievance request. HUD has no basis to imposean arbitrary minimum period. Different PHAs may legitimately establishdifferent deadlines. Each individual PHA is better able to weigh the consequencesof different grievance request periods for the PHA and for the tenants.In the statute, the Congress elected to prescribe specific periods forthe notice of lease termination (e.g., fourteen days for non-payment),but declined to prescribe a specific minimum time period for a tenant tosubmit the request for a hearing. The law posits only that the tenant requestmust be ``timely''. Similarly, the Department declines to impose specificminimum time periods in this rule. HUD is concerned that the minimum ten or fifteen day request periods proposedin public comment could considerably distort and delay the process foreviction of a public housing tenant. For example, the Congress recognizedthat the PHA should have quick access to the courts where a tenant threatenshealth or safety of tenants or employees. The Congress therefore provided that in such cases the lease terminationnotice may not be less than a ``reasonable time''. In these cases, thelaw does not define a fixed minimum period for termination of the lease.The fixed grievance request periods proposed by public comment are notconsistent with the statutory requirement for ``timely'' request withinthe period of the lease termination notice. Moreover, the proposed requestperiods could considerably extend the time for eviction of these tenants,and thereby prolong the danger for tenants and employees.In an eviction for non-payment of rent, delay in completion of the grievancehearing tends to delay the process for eviction of the tenant. In practice,the PHA may not be able to commence the judicial eviction action untilexpiration of a total period comprised of the period for tenant to requesta grievance hearing, plus the period for determination of the grievanceon the tenant's request. To facilitate prompt processing of evictions fornon-payment of rent, in accordance with the statutory objective (U.S. HousingAct of 1937, section 6(c)(4)(B), 42 U.S.C. 1437(d)(4)(B)), the PHA shouldbe able to establish an accelerated deadline for the tenant to submit arequest for hearing.The notice of adverse action informs the tenant that the PHA intends totake some action contrary to the tenant's interest, and how and when toask for a hearing. After receiving the notice, a tenant does not need along period to submit a simple request to grieve on a PHA action. Thereis no reason to believe that a uniform minimum period of ten days or fifteendays is more effective than a shorter period in assuring that the tenanthas a practical opportunity to ask for a grievance hearing on PHA adverseaction. We also remark here, as in other contexts, that a termination ofthe tenant's right to an administrative grievance hearing before the PHAdoes not mean that the tenant loses the chance for a hearing on the issue.If the PHA seeks eviction of the tenant, the tenant will have the opportunityfor a due process hearing in State court.In the final rule, HUD adopts the recommendation that the regulation shouldset a general standard governing establishment by a PHA of a deadline forthe tenant to request a hearing, and that the regulation should not allowthe use of unreasonable limits. The final rule adds a provision that thehearing must be requested by a ``reasonable deadline as determined by thePHA'' (andSection; 966.31(c)(2)(i)).An individual PHA may have good reason to set different deadlines for differenttypes of grievance. The rule therefore provides that ``the PHA may establishdifferent rules for determining the deadline for requesting a hearing indifferent circumstances, or for different types of grievance'' (andSection;966.31(c)(2)(ii)).Under the language of the rule, the decision on how long a period to allowthe tenant for requesting a hearing fundamentally rests in the sound administrativediscretion of the PHA. The reasonableness of the deadline is ``determinedby the PHA''. The language of the rule is not intended as an invitationfor courts to freely second-guess the PHA on what deadlines are reasonable.The PHA is in the best position to balance the administrative and programconsequences of different deadlines, as against the tenant interest insecuring a grievance hearing on proposed adverse action. Under common Statestandards for judicial review of agency action, the PHA determination ofan appropriate request deadline should stand unless the determination isarbitrary and capricious, i.e., there is no reasonable basis for the determination.d. <T3>PHA Grant of Exceptions to Deadline.</T3> Comment states that the PHAshould have authority to grant good cause exceptions where a tenant failsto request a hearing by the PHA deadline, or that the PHA should be requiredto approve deadline exceptions for good cause. The final rule permits thePHA to grant an exception from the deadline ``if the PHA determines thatthe exception is justified by individual circumstances'' (andSection; 966.31(c)(2)(ii)).However, the rule does not require the PHA to grant exceptions.The general decision to provide for good cause exceptions in the PHA grievanceprocess, as well as the decision to grant or deny an exception in a particularcase, should rest in the administrative judgment of the PHA. The authorityfor grant of exceptions (to the PHA's generally applicable deadline forrequesting a hearing) affords the PHA leeway to respond to special circumstancesin individual cases. The rule allows the PHA flexibility to respond tospecial problems not accounted for in determination of the PHA deadlinepolicy.The Department does not find sufficient reason to direct the grant of deadlineexceptions in the PHA grievance process. A PHA may properly judge thatthe benefits that may flow from allowing exceptions in special cases donot outweigh the benefits of a policy that flatly denies access to thegrievance process for a tenant who misses the grievance deadline.First, if a PHA elects to allow exceptions, the PHA partially forgoes theadvantages of imposing a grievance deadline. The PHA loses the administrativecertainty that the grievance process is past once the deadline is past.The PHA therefore loses the ability to take appropriate action on thisbasis. The PHA's uncertainty on the outcome of a grievance request is extendedwhile the PHA is deciding whether to grant an exception. If an exceptionis granted, the uncertainty is further extended through completion of thegrievance hearing. In contrast, if the PHA decides to deny grant of anydeadline exceptions, the PHA knows the grievance process is over as soonas the deadline has expired.Second, the PHA may properly consider the administrative burden of processingrequests for exception_with the need to sift through individual exceptionrequests to determine if there is good cause for exception. Processingof exception requests burdens the PHA with the need to determine that individualrequests are bona fide, and are based on grounds which justify an exception.By deciding to allow exceptions, the PHA is necessarily exposed to theadministrative burdens of the process for grant of exceptions, as wellas the burden of carrying forward the hearing process if the exceptionis granted. The PHA may lack, or believe that it lacks, ability to readilydistinguish between good faith claims for exception, and specious excusesfor missing the deadline.Third, opening the door to PHA consideration of requests for exceptionon behalf of tenants who miss the deadline may diminish the pressure fortenants to comply with the deadline.In short, a PHA may have good and sufficient reason to establish a flatdeadline for requesting a hearing under the PHA grievance process, withoutallowing any exception.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Elements of Hearing </ITAG>a. Person Conducting Hearing_(1) Selection of Hearing Officer_Statute andRule. Section 6(k)(2) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 provides that thehearing on a proposed PHA adverse action must be held ``before an impartialparty'' (42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)(2)).The rule (andSection; 966.32(a)) states that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) A hearing under the PHA's administrative grievance procedure shallbe conducted by a person or persons (who may be an employee or officerof the PHA) designated by the PHA in the manner required under the PHA'sgrievance procedure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The hearing officer shall be someone other than the person whomade or approved the decision for the proposed adverse action under reviewor a subordinate of such person.</ITAG>(2) Designation of PHA Officer or Employee As Hearing Officer. PHA commentbroadly supports the hearing procedures. Comment approves the PHA's broadauthority to designate a hearing officer, and to appoint an officer oremployee of the PHA. The PHA may designate a hearing officer who has knowledgeand experience of the PHA and the public housing program. Comment notesthat this background will help a hearing officer arrive at a solid, responsibleand impartial decision.The Department believes that the PHA should have wide discretion to appointas hearing officer a person with knowledge of the program, and of technicalprogram requirements and procedures (such as technical procedures for determinationof the tenant rent in accordance with the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 andHUD rules). The Department has stated that:<ITAG tagnum="20">this familiarity can assist in a more rapid, more economical and moreaccurate determination on the points at issue. The PHA hearing processshould be able to benefit from the experience of the hearing officer, especiallyknowledge concerning program requirements and procedures. (49 FR 12229,March 29, 1984.)</ITAG>The rule prohibits use of a hearing officer participated in (``made orapproved'') the challenged decision, or a subordinate of that person. Byprohibiting use of a subordinate of the original decision-maker, HUD seeksto assure that the hearing officer is not subject to the pressures of asuperior, and to thus enhance the independence and objectivity of the hearingprocess. The rule specifies that a person who ``approved'' the originaldecision may not conduct the informal hearing.Legal aid comment asserts that the authority of the PHA to designate ahearing officer is too broad. Comment especially objects to appointingan officer or employee of the PHA as the hearing officer. Comment claimsthat a PHA officer or employee is not impartial and disinterested. A tenantwill see the grievance hearing as a kangaroo court. Comment objects topermitting the PHA to use a hearing officer who is a <T3>superior </T3>of the decision-maker, or is a <T3>co-worker </T3>or <T3>peer </T3>of the decision-maker.HUD has not revised the proposed provisions on designation of the hearingofficer. In the context of the administrative grievance process for thepublic housing program, the standards stated in the proposed rule are asufficient guarantee of impartiality.The purpose of the grievance hearing is to give the tenant a chance fora review of the PHA decision, to see if the PHA has violated an applicablelaw or rule. In the administrative hearing, the tenant gets the benefitof a second look at the challenged decision, by someone other than a personwho made or approved the original decision. Since the hearing officer_including a superior, peer or co-worker of thedecision-maker_did not make or approve the original decision challengedin the grievance hearing_the review is not prejudiced by the mind-set ofthe original decision-maker. Through this review, PHA error can be uncoveredand rectified.In objecting to the authority for the PHA to use a superior of the decision-makeras the hearing officer, legal aid comment suggests that a grievance mayarise from application of a faulty <T3>policy </T3>by the decision maker. The hearing officer may be the personwho promulgated the PHA policy. If the policy is flawed, the person whoimplemented the policy cannot be an independent hearing officer.In response, several points should be remarked:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">_The purpose of a grievance hearing is to decide whether the PHA hasviolated some law or rule. The grievance hearing is not a forum for considerationof general policy issues or class grievances (for reasons discussed elsewherein this Preamble. See section V.D.2.a). The question whether the PHA policyis or is not ``faulty'' is not at issue in the grievance hearing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">_If a tenant challenges the application of a policy to the tenant(i.e., whether the application of the policy violates some law or rule),a person involved in original issuance of the policy may properly considerwhether the policy has been properly carried out with regard to the tenant.Indeed, there may be considerable advantage in using as hearing officera person who has direct and intimate knowledge of the policy.The 1983 law provides that a statutory grievance hearing must be conducted``before an <T3>impartial </T3>party''. A hearing officer who is an officer or employeeof the PHA, or who is a superior, peer of co-worker of the decision-maker,is able to provide an impartial second look at the challenged decision.In <T3>Lopez v. Phipps Plaza </T3>(498 F.2d 937, 943 (2d Cir. 1974)) (rejectingdue process objection to appointment of hearing officer in subsidized housing),the opinion by Judge Friendly notes that a housing authority official doesnot lack impartiality simply because he is an officer of the housing authority.The opinion states that:<ITAG tagnum="21">As the hearing requirement is imposed on more and more agencies ** *, there will be greater and greater necessity for entrusting decisionto agency personnel * * * * Moreover, confiding the [hearing] decision* * * to a person with experience in the management of housing projectshas positive factors * * * *</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In <T3>Lopez, </T3>the court also notes approvingly that under prior publichousing grievance procedures there are no specific restrictions on whothe PHA may appoint as an ``impartial hearing officer'' (498 F.2d at 944n. 5).In considering the elements of a due process administrative hearing, theSupreme Court has concluded that an agency official is not barred fromacting as impartial hearing officer, so long as the hearing officer hasnot ``participated in making the determination under review'' (<T3>Goldberg v. Kelly, </T3>397 U.S. 254, 271, 90 S. Ct. 1011, 1022 (1970)).This rule prohibits the designation of a hearing officer who participatedin (``made or approved'') the challenged decision.Comment asks that the rule be revised to make sure that the hearing officerhas no <T3>ex parte </T3>contacts with PHA officials. HUD sees no need for a provisionbarring contacts with PHA officials. The PHA should have flexibility instructuring the administrative grievance process. PHA discretion shouldnot be constricted by unnecessary or over-detailed Federal rules; or byrules modelled on judicial procedures. There should be room for adoptionof hearing procedures which allow considerable informality in conduct ofthe hearing, or which allow a PHA to organize a hearing process in unconventionalways_for example, with authority for the hearing officer to actively investigatethe facts, and question persons, including PHA employees or officials,who may have knowledge of the facts.Of course, the PHA's hearing procedure, and the actions of a hearing officerunder the procedure, must be consistent with the purpose of the hearingprocess_to provide the tenant with the opportunity for a fair hearing ongrievable issues. The hearing officer may not collude with the PHA to denythe tenant a real ``opportunity for an informal hearing'', as requiredby the law and the rule andSection; 966.31(a)(1)).(3) Elimination of Requirements For Use of Hearing Panel and For TenantParticipation In Selection. Under the old lease and grievance rule, thePHA and the tenant participate on equal terms in selection of a hearingofficer or hearing panel. Under the new rule, the hearing is conductedby a ``person or persons'' selected by the PHA (andSection; 966.32(a)(1)).The PHA decides whether to use a panel or single hearing officer.Legal aid comment objects to eliminating the old rule requirement to usea hearing panel (unless the tenant and PHA agree on appointment of a singlehearing officer). Comment also objects to eliminating the requirement forthe tenant to participate in selecting the officer. Comment claims thattenant participation insures impartiality.PHA comment favors permitting the PHA to designate the hearing officer,and the related authority to appoint a PHA employee or official as thehearing officer. PHA comment points out practical problems in administrationof the old system. There are problems finding citizens to serve as hearingofficers. The old rule does not provide a mechanism to appoint a grievanceofficer when local volunteers cannot be found. PHA comment notes that withelimination of the panel requirement hearings can be conducted more expeditiously.Under the old rule, hearing panel selection can take weeks.The procedure for selection of hearing officers under the old rule is expensive,cumbersome and slow. The old procedure is structured in a way that givesopportunities for the tenant to hamstring the hearing process, by refusingto cooperate in expeditious appointment of panel members (allowing, forexample, the tenant or tenant counsel to delay the point at which the PHAcan commence judicial action to evict a tenant for non-payment of rent).In HUD's view, there is no justification for retention of the unsatisfactorysystem under the old rule.(4) Authority of Hearing Officer. To operate a practical and orderly hearingmachinery, the hearing officer must have authority to regulate the conductof the hearing, including determinations on the relevance of proof thatmay be offered, and of the manner in which evidence is presented. The ruletherefore states (andSection; 966.32(c)):``The hearing officer may regulate the conduct of the administrative grievancehearing in accordance with the PHA's administrative grievance procedure.''<T3>b. Right of Tenant to Examine Relevant PHA Materials</T3>_(1) Statuteand Regulation. Section 6(k)(3) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 providesthat in an administrative grievance hearing on proposed PHA adverse actionthe tenant must ``have an opportunity to examine any documents or recordsof regulations related to the proposed [adverse] action'' (42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)(3)).The final rule provides (andSection; 966.32(d)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The Tenant shall be permitted to examine and copy any relevant non-privilegeddocuments in the possession or control of the PHA, including records orregulations. This opportunity shall be given at a time that will give theTenant a reasonable opportunity to make use of the information in the grievanceproceeding. If the PHA fails to produce documents timely, in response tothe Tenant's request for examination, the hearing officer may prohibitthe PHA from using the documents at the hearing.</ITAG>(2) When PHA Must Produce Documents. Some comment endorses proposed provisionsrequiring the PHA to make relevant documents available for examinationby the tenant. Other comment recommends that the PHA should be requiredto produce documents before hearing, so that the tenant can make effectiveuse of documents produced by the PHA. Comment states that the regulationshould specify a minimum period of access by the tenant before the grievancehearing (such as 5 days).Comment which recommends that HUD require the PHA to produce documentsprior to the ``hearing'' are not adopted in the final rule. The rule doesnot regulate in detail the procedure for making the information availableto the tenant. The proposed rule also does not assume a clear and neatdistinction between a pre-hearing ``discovery'' phase, and the ``hearing''proper. The informal hearing may unfold as a meeting, or a series of informalmeetings or exchanges, between the parties and the hearing officer. ThePHA will possess considerable discretion to determine the incidents ofthe hearing process, so long as the process is consistent with the minimumelements defined in the statute and the rule. In addition, the hearingofficer has a broad authority to decide issues concerning the productionof documents.Given the variable character of the local hearing process, and of the particularmatters to be examined, the rule does not specify the point of the hearingprocess at which information in the hands of the PHA must be furnishedto the tenant. Rather, the rule focuses on a practical question_whetherthe information is given at a time that provides a ``reasonable opportunity''to make use of the information for purposes of the hearing.Comment which urges that the PHA should have to produce the documents inadvance of the hearing'' assume that the hearing process is structuredwith a clear distinction between a pre-hearing phase, and the hearing itself.This position is implicitly modelled on the conventional judicial processfor trial of a lawsuit, where there is characteristically a clear distinctionbetween the pre-trial discovery phase and the trial.The 1983 law does not dictate that the PHA administrative grievance hearingmust be so structured. The PHA should be allowed to structure a grievanceprocess which conforms with the minimum elements prescribed in the 1983law, and which reflects the judgment and management discretion of the PHA.The grievance process should not be rigidly cast in the mold of a judicialtrial, with a requirement for pre-hearing discovery. The tenant has a statutoryright to ``some kind of hearing'' (see generally Friendly, ``Some Kindof Hearing'', 123 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1267 (1975)), so that the grievance canbe fairly considered by the hearing officer. The tenant does not have aright or need for a hearing process patterned on a judicial trial. The purpose of the tenant's right to examine PHA documents is to allowthe tenant to use the documents for purposes of the hearing, such as toshow the hearing officer that the tenant's rent is not rightly computed;or to show the hearing officer that the PHA does not have grounds to terminatethe tenancy. This objective is wholly protected by providing that the tenantmust have a ``reasonable opportunity'' to use the information in the proceeding.Of course, the PHA and the tenant may dispute, in a particular instance,whether the tenant has or has not had a reasonable opportunity for examinationof the document for use in the hearing proceeding. The PHA and tenant mayalso dispute the proper cure for the problem_e.g., by a delay in the proceedingsso that the tenant has more time for preparation. These issues may be decidedby the hearing officer.Comment states that the PHA should be prohibited from relying on documentsnot produced by the PHA for examination by the tenant. HUD agrees thata PHA which fails to make discovery of documents should be subject to appropriateremedy, including the possibility that the PHA may be precluded from usingthe documents in the hearing. The nature of the remedy should be decidedby the hearing officer, in light of the particular circumstances and therequirements of the PHA administrative grievance procedure. The rule shouldnot prohibit PHA use of the documents across the board, in all cases. Theexistence or degree of PHA fault, the harm to the tenant, and the mostappropriate cure for the failure, will differ in different cases. In somecases, the PHA failure to produce a document may be inadvertent and innocuous.In other cases, the failure may proceed from deliberate concealment bythe PHA, and may severely hinder the tenant's presentation of the grievance.The final rule adds a new provision that if the PHA fails to produce documentstimely, in response to the tenant's request for examination, the hearingofficer may prohibit the PHA from using the documents at the hearing.(3) Possession or Control of Documents. The proposed rule required thePHA to produce relevant documents ``in the possession of the PHA''. Commentstates that the rule should require the PHA to discover documents <T3>under control of</T3> the PHA. This provision would guard against thepossibility of a PHA evading production of documents by transferring thedocuments to another party, such as the PHA attorney.The final rule provides that the PHA must produce documents which are ``inthe possession <T3>or control</T3>'' of the PHA.(4) Relevance of Documents; Privileged Documents. Comment objects to givingthe tenant a right of access to ``any'' relevant material, and notes thatthe rule does not say who determines ``relevance''. The tenant should notbe allowed to ``rummage at random'' through PHA documents, which may violatethe privacy and confidentiality of tenant records. Comment recommends revisingthe rule to provide that the PHA has an absolute right to refuse accessto confidential files.Under the rule, the tenant has no right to ``rummage at random'', onlya right to examine relevant documents. If there is a dispute on relevanceof documents demanded, the hearing officer may decide the relevance ofdocuments sought by the tenant. The PHA may establish procedures neededto safeguard privacy and confidentiality of tenant records.The final rule clarifies that the tenant does not have a right to examinePHA documents which are privileged. The PHA must give the tenant the opportunityto examine any relevant ``non-privileged'' documents. The rule does notdisturb the PHA's right to deny production of privileged documents in accordancewith State law, for example a State-created right to withhold documentssubject to attorney client privilege. At the same time, however, the ruledoes not establish any Federal privilege against production, or any rulesgoverning the circumstances in which a privilege arises. Rather, the ruledefers to State law determining the existence or non-existence of privilege,and therefore to State policy underlying the grant or denial of a privilege.The tenant's Federal right to examine PHA documents related to proposedadverse action does not sweep aside State-law privileges against productionof documents.<T3>c. Evidence_</T3>(1). Statute and Rule. Section 6(k)(5) of the U.S.Housing Act of 1937 provides that in a hearing on proposed adverse actionthe tenant will ``be entitled to ask questions of witnesses and have othersmake statements on his behalf'' (42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)(5)).The final rule provides (andSection; 966.32(e)):<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The Tenant and the PHA may present evidence, and may questionany witnesses. The Tenant and the PHA may have others make statements atthe hearing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Evidence may be considered without regard to admissibility underthe rules of evidence which apply in judicial proceedings.''</ITAG>(2) Acceptability of Evidence. In receiving and weighing evidence offeredby the parties, the hearing officer is not bound by the rules of evidencewhich apply in a court (andSection; 966.32(e)(2)). The formal rules of evidencein a judicial proceeding are not suitable for the informal grievance hearingsrequired under this rule.Comment states that the rule should prohibit use hearsay evidence, or useof hearsay as the ``primary'' evidence. The PHA may try to establish acase at hearing by written declaration, or other hearsay testimony, thusavoiding cross-examination of witnesses. The PHA and the tenant shouldbe required to produce any witnesses on whose statements they propose torely. Comment also claims that lack of standards on acceptability of hearsayevidence is an invitation to untested innuendo.The final rule does not prohibit use of ``hearsay'' evidence, or add anyadditional rules on admissibility of evidence. Public comment does notdemonstrate a need to complicate PHA administration of the grievance processby imposing technical rules of evidence. The HUD regulation should notimport into the informal grievance hearing the arcane and artificial complexitiesof the evidentiary rules applied in a court trial, or even a simplifiedversion of those rules. When applied in the administrative grievance process,a broad hearsay prohibition may force the rejection of valid and probativeevidence of the truth.The use of more complicated hearing rules, including technical restrictionson the reception and use of certain types of evidence, would tend to forcePHAs to use hearing officers who are able to understand and work with therules. Imposition of complicated evidentiary and other procedural requirementstends to promote PHA employment of lawyers and other law-trained professionalsas hearing officers. The national public housing grievance requirementsshould be stated as simply as possible, to permit the broadest freedomto choose lay hearing officers, including tenants, PHA employees, or otherpersons drawn from the community. Persons who are not expert in the laware well able to serve as administrative hearing officers, so long as HUDdoes not burden the informal hearing process with unneeded technical requirements.The purpose of the hearing on any question of fact is to determine thetruth respecting the question at issue. A prohibition against use of technical``hearsay'' may prevent the use of valuable evidence which could properlyinform the decision of the hearing officer. In the context of an administrativegrievance proceeding, the use of evidence other than direct testimony bya witness to the events or facts at issue may properly influence the judgmentof the hearing officer on the weight or significance of the evidence.In deciding to admit and consider a written declaration or other ``hearsay''as evidence on some issue of fact, the hearing officer may discount theprobative value of evidence as to which the parties or the hearing officerhave not had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness in the courseof the hearing. The hearing officer may refuse to receive hearsay evidence,or may decline to believe the evidence received. The decision of the hearingofficer should be based on good judgment and common sense as to the forceof the information offered in proof. As a matter of local choice, the PHAadministrative grievance procedure may restrict or regulate use of hearsayin the local grievance process. However, HUD should not nationally imposethis restriction on the local grievance process.(3) Use of Statements. The statute requires, and the rule correspondinglyprovides, that the tenant may ``have others make <T3>statements'' </T3>on behalf of the tenant (U.S. Housing Act of 1937,section 6(k)(5), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)(5); andSection; 966.32(e)(1)). The statuteand rule also provide that the tenant is entitled to representation bya person of his choice. (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(k)(4), 42U.S.C. 1437d(k)(4); andSection; 966.32(b); see section V.E.6.d of this Preamble.)The rule separately states that the tenant (as well as the PHA) ``may presentevidence, and may question any witnesses'' (andSection; 966.32(e))1)).Comment expresses concern that the rule language on use of tenant ``statements''is not clear. Comment asks if the language means that the tenant may submitwritten statements by persons not present at the hearing, or only meansthat the tenant has a right to have people appear and testify for the tenant.If the tenant has a right to submit written statements, the PHA shouldhave the same right. Comment asks clarification that the PHA has a rightto question tenant statements, and the people who make the statements.The statutory authority for a tenant to have ``others'' make ``statements''on behalf of the tenant does not explicitly distinguish between statementsoffered as proof of some fact, i.e., as evidence, or other statements offeredin support of the tenant's position, e.g., as argument or discussion. Inthis rule, HUD finds no present need to distinguish between these possibleapplications of the statutory requirement. Rather the rule broadly allowsthe submission of ``statements''_whether or not offered as evidence ofa fact. Where the statement is in the nature of evidence, the right tohave ``others'' make ``statements'' overlaps the regulatory right to present``evidence'' supporting the position of the tenant. Where the statementis in the nature of argument, the right to make statements partially overlapsthe right of the tenant to have representation chosen by the tenant.The final rule is revised to provide that the right to submit ``statements''_likethe right to present evidence at the hearing_applies symmetrically to boththe PHA and the tenant (andSection; 966.32(e)(1)). The PHA should have anequal right to present its position at the hearing, both in presentationof evidence, and in presentation of arguments that support the positionof the PHA.Comment on the tenant's right to submit written statements, and on theright of the PHA to question persons who make statements, fundamentallyraises the same issue treated above in the discussion of ``hearsay'' evidence.The administrative grievance procedure adopted by a PHA may regulate theuse of statements (for the tenant or for the PHA) by persons not presentat the hearing. Insofar as statements are offered as evidence, here toothere is no need for HUD to establish rules on the treatment of evidenceby declaration of persons who are not present at the hearing, and thusare not available to be questioned by the parties.(4) Basis of Decision. The rule provides (andSection; 966.33(a)) that ``factualdeterminations [by the hearing officer] concerning the individual circumstancesof the Tenant and Household shall be based on evidence presented at thehearing''. The rule does not prohibit the hearing officer from making useof knowledge about the project or about program requirements and procedures.Comment objects to allowing the hearing officer to base a hearing decisionon the officer's general information, or otherwise on facts not presentedat the hearing, and which are not included in the hearing record. (Thisconcern was expressed by public comment on the December 1982 proposed rule,as well as the July 1986 proposed rule.) Comment states that allowing thehearing officer to rely on prior information makes a mockery of the hearing.The tenant is not able to confront and cross-examine witnesses. The hearingdecision should be solely based on evidence presented at the hearing.HUD believes that the PHA hearing process should be able to benefit fromthe experience of the hearing officer. Indeed the ability to select hearingofficers with relevant knowledge about the project and program is one ofthe important advantages of using the informal administrative grievanceprocedure instead of the courts. For the types of issues most often raised in a public housing grievancehearing, the special knowledge of the hearing officer may be of great helpin reaching a decision which is accurate, fair and fast. PHA managementand hearing resources are not wasted by the need to prove common pointsat each successive individual hearing before the same hearing officer.For example, grievance hearings often involve the question whether a tenant'srent was correctly computed under HUD regulations and procedures. The hearingofficer may develop some expertise in HUD regulations and procedures forthese computations. The PHA is not required to obtain for each new hearing a hearing officerwho is innocent of relevant general program knowledge. If the officer possessesgeneral program knowledge relevant to the issue at hearing, the officershould not pretend, in each new hearing, that points of general informationare novel and must be demonstrated anew (by receiving in evidence the sameHUD regulations and procedures, or by hearing the same testimony by thesame witnesses). Allowing the hearing officer to rely on prior general or program knowledgeand experience does not, as implied by comment, intrinsically bias thehearing in favor of the PHA. The use of a hearing officer with better generalknowledge or expertise will tend to produce better decisions_decisionsbased on a correct understanding of the relation between the individualcircumstances of the tenant (shown by evidence presented at the hearing)and general program requirements or circumstances. If the hearing officeris knowledgeable, the hearing officer may be better able to penetrate PHAmistakes in applying technical procedures, may be less likely to deferto the PHA's assumed expertise. In addition, permitting reliance on theofficer's prior general knowledge dose not preclude the tenant or the PHAfrom presenting witnesses or documentary evidence on any point at issue,e.g., to challenge the PHA's construction of HUD requirements as appliedto the individual tenant. Allowing the hearing officer to make use of general program informationnot presented at the hearing is supported by the legislative history ofthe grievance hearing requirement under section 6(k) of the U.S. HousingAct of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)). The bill reported by the House BankingCommittee would have required a PHA to establish an administrative grievanceprocedure that would provide tenants an opportunity to be heard ``in accordancewith the basic safeguards of due process'' (Report 98-123 on H.R. 1, P.175). The bill did not state the list of administrative hearing requirementscontained in the law as finally enacted. However, in reporting out thebill, the Housing Banking Committee stated a list of elements which mustbe included in the PHA hearing process under the bill (Report 98-123 onH.R. 1, p. 36), which is generally similar to the list of administrativehearing requirements in the law as passed by the Congress. The hearingrequirements listed in the Report of the House Committee included ``a decision<T3>based solely on the record </T3>and explained in writing''. The requirementof a decision ``based solely on the record'' was deleted in the final legislation.This legislative history supports the conclusion that in reaching a decisionthe hearing officer may use general information already known to the hearingofficer, and not contained in the record of the proceeding. Comment challenges HUD's reading of the legislative history. The commentclaims that if the Congress intended a break from past practice under theHUD lease and grievance requirements the Congress <T3>would have said so </T3>explicitly. This comment does not support achange in HUD's analysis of the law and legislative history. The duty ofthe Department is to carry out the law actually enacted by the Congress,not to imagine what the Congress would have or should have done, or toinvent supposed statutory restrictions not stated in the law.In reading the legislative history, HUD properly points to the fact thatthe text of the law actually passed by the Congress does not include therequirement for a decision exclusively based on the record, although thiselement was explicitly considered and mentioned by the House committee.The regulation here promulgated is a fair implementation of the statutoryhearing requirements finally passed by the Congress, and contained in thelaw presented for signature by the President. Comment expresses concern that the tenant will not have a chance to correctinaccurate information (based on prior information of the hearing officer).Comment states that if a hearing officer has prior knowledge of programpolicies and procedures, the officer should indicate an intention to takeadministrative notice of the facts, and give the parties an opportunityto dispute the facts during the hearing.The final rule does not require the hearing officer to give advance noticeof intention to take notice of non-record facts. Under the rule, the hearingofficer has ample authority and opportunity to inform the parties thatthe hearing officer may rely on general information not included in thehearing record, and to give an opportunity for the parties to dispute assumptionsor information of the hearing officer. The value of this procedure dependson the particular facts and issues which are subject to the grievance hearing,and should be left to the sound judgment and discretion of the hearingofficer in each informal hearing. HUD sees no sufficient reason to universallyimpose on the PHA grievance hearing a cumbersome two-step process in whichthe hearing officer must in all cases first announce that the decisionmay include non-record elements (followed by the opportunity to offer evidenceon these elements), in addition to issuing a final written decision statingthe basis for the decision of the hearing officer. d. <T3>Representation of Tenant. </T3>Section 6(k)(4) of the U.S. HousingAct of 1937 provides that in a hearing on proposed PHA adverse action thetenant is ``entitled to be represented by another person of his choiceat any hearing'' (42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)(4)). The rule (andSection; 966.32(b))provides that ``at its own expense, the Tenant may be represented at thehearing by a person of the Tenant's choice.'' e. <T3>Promptness of Hearing. </T3>When a hearing is required, the PHA mustproceed with the hearing ``in a reasonably expeditious manner and in accordancewith the PHA's administrative grievance procedure'' (andSection; 966.32(f)).The final rule eliminates superfluous language stating that the expeditioushearing requirement applies in cases where a grievance hearing is requiredunder the rule. All of the hearing procedures apply to a grievance hearingrequired under the rule. <T3>f. Fees or Costs for Hearing. </T3>Comment recommends that the ruleprohibiting the PHA from requiring a tenant to pay any costs of the grievancehearing, or to pay a fee of the hearing officer. This proposal is adopted.The final rule provides andSection; 966.31(f)): <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Prohibition of hearing fees. </T3>The PHA may not require a Tenantto pay any hearing fees or hearing costs as a condition for providing theTenant the opportunity for an administrative grievance hearing under thePHA grievance procedure, and may not impose any hearing fees or hearingcosts on the Tenant. (However, the PHA may require the payment of TenantRent as a condition for a hearing concerning Tenant Rent in accordancewith andSection;966.31(d).)</ITAG>The prohibition of hearing fees or costs helps to preserve the practicalability of tenants to be heard in the statutory grievance process. Impositionof hearing fees or costs may discourage tenants from raising proper grievanceswhich are cognizable in the administrative grievance process. By definition,families participating in the program are poor. A tenant may be reluctantto ask for a grievance hearing because the tenant fears exposure to possiblehearing fees. Unlike rent owed by a participant tenant, hearing fees or costs are notitems the tenant is obligated to pay in the absence of a hearing. In addition,unlike back rents, possible hearing fees are not a major potential sourceof PHA income. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Hearing Decision</ITAG><T3>a. Informing Tenant of Decision. </T3>Section 6(k)(6) of the U.S. HousingAct of 1937 requires that in a hearing on proposed PHA adverse action thetenant is ``entitled to receive a written decision by the public housingagency on the proposed [adverse] action'' (42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)(6)). Therule provides andSection; 966.33(a)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The hearing officer shall issue a written decision which states thebasic reasons for the decision * * * A copy of the hearing decision shallbe furnished promptly to the Tenant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(For discussion of the evidentiary basis of a determination concerningindividual tenant circumstances, see section V.E.6.c.(4) of Preamble)</ITAG>The Preamble to the July 1986 proposed rule notes that:<ITAG tagnum="20">the statement of decision * * * tells the family what was decided,and the reasons for the decision. It is intended that the written statementof decision must be truly informative as to the reasons for the decision.A bare and conclusory statement of the hearing decision, that does notlet the family know the basic reasons for the decision, would not satisfythe decision requirement under the proposed rule. (51 FR at 26520)</ITAG>PHA comment approves the provision of the proposed rule on the form ofa hearing decision. Other comment argues that a regulatory requirement to state ``basic reasons''for the grievance decision is not adequate. The decision requirement shouldbe expanded or clarified. Comment states that a tenant should get noticeof ``specific'' reasons for decision. The decision should set out the factualbasis for the determination. Comment states that the regulation text shouldincorporate the HUD interpretation (in Preamble to the July 1986 proposedrule) that a decision must include a ``truly informative'' statement ofthe basic reasons for decision. The language of the proposed rule is not changed. A simple requirementto state ``basic reasons'' for the decision fully carries out the purposeof the written decision. First, because the hearing officer must write and issue a decision, theofficer is compelled to consider and articulate the basic reasons for thedecision. Thus the officer is more likely to issue a decision properlybased on the facts and the law at issue in the grievance hearing. Second, the authority of PHA administrative process, and of the hearingdecision on the tenant's challenge to PHA adverse action, is enhanced ifa tenant is presented with the basic reasons for the hearing decision,rather than a bare statement of the hearing result. Whether or not a tenantagrees with the particular decision, the tenant and other families aremore likely to accept the decision as a legitimate product of a legitimateprocess. It does not follow, however, that a more extensive or more legalistic statementof decision will improve the quality of decision, or the degree of tenantsatisfaction and acceptance. A more demanding statement of the decisionrequirement may be harder to write, harder to understand and harder toadminister. HUD also finds not need to incorporate in text of the rule the explanatorylanguage in the Preamble of the proposed rule (which asserts that the statementof decision must be truly informative, and may not be limited to a bareand conclusory statement of the hearing decision). The Preamble languagedoes not add any additional substantive requirement, but merely spellsout the implications of the requirement to give ``basic reasons'' for thehearing decision. HUD recognizes that questions will arise as to what is a sufficient statementof ``basic reasons'' in a concrete case. Such issues naturally arise inapplication of any regulatory standard, and will not be avoided by a moreverbose statement of the rule. <T3>b. Effect of Decision on PHA or Tenant</T3>_(1) When PHA Is Not BoundBy Decision_<T3>(a) PHA Determination. </T3>The rule states circumstances in whichthe PHA is not bound by a decision of the hearing officer (andSection;966.33(b)):<ITAG tagnum="21">The PHA is not bound by a hearing decision if: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The decision concerns a matter for which an administrative grievancehearing is not required * * * or otherwise in excess of the authority ofthe hearing officer, or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The decision is contrary to HUD regulations or requirements, orotherwise contrary to Federal, State or local law.</ITAG>The rule also provides (andSection; 966.33(c)) that:<ITAG tagnum="21">If the PHA determines that it is not bound by the decision of thehearing officer, the PHA shall promptly notify the Tenant in writing ofthe determination, and of the reasons for the determination.</ITAG>Legal aid comment objects to giving the PHA power to determine that thePHA is not bound by decision of a hearing officer in the grievance process.Comment objects to authorizing the PHA to repudiate a decision which exceedsthe authority of the hearing officer. The PHA should be bound by the hearingdecision unless the decision is contrary to law.Comment asserts that the hearing process is useless if a PHA can unilaterallyreject the hearing decision. Comment suggests that the decision that agrievance determination is contrary to law, and is therefore not binding,must be made by an impartial party, and may not be made by the PHA.PHA comment welcomes the provisions authorizing a PHA to determine thatthe PHA is not bound by a hearing decision. Comment notes that clarificationof this issue is overdue.The final rule does not change the proposed provisions which define whenthe PHA is not bound by the grievance decision. These provisions are importantto insure that the hearing officer operates within the role assigned bythe PHA grievance procedure under this rule, and to specify that the PHAis not bound by illegal decisions.The purpose of the hearing process is to give the tenant the opportunityfor a fair hearing_to ascertain whether a proposed adverse action by thePHA is in accordance with law, HUD regulations or PHA rules. It is theproper function of the hearing officer to decide the propriety of the PHA'sproposed adverse action under the grievance scheme established by the 1983Federal law (section 6(k) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437(k)),the HUD rule which implements the law, and the administrative grievanceprocedure adopted by the PHA under the rule.The charge of the grievance officer is to determine the grievance assignedfor the officer's decision in accordance with this scheme. The PHA shouldnot be bound by a decision that strays from this charge, or which otherwiseinvades the sphere entrusted to administrative determination by the PHA.For example, the PHA is not bound by a grievance determination on a matterother than a proposed adverse action, by a determination concerning generalpolicy issues or class grievances, or by a determination on a matter notproperly referred to the hearing officer in accordance with the PHA grievanceprocedure.The rule provides that a PHA is not bound by a decision contrary to HUDregulations or requirements, or otherwise contrary to Federal, State orlocal law (andSection; 966.33(b)(2)). The PHA has final responsibility toact in accordance with controlling Federal, State or local law, and thisobligation may not be altered by any decision of the hearing officer (compareandSection; 966.57(b) of the old lease and grievance rule).HUD does not agree with comment which argues that the right of the PHAto reject the hearing decision in specified circumstances means that thehearing process is useless. In practice, a PHA will not and can not casuallyreject the decision of the hearing officer.<ITAG tagnum="15">_The hearing is conducted under the PHA's own grievance procedure,and decided by a hearing officer appointed by the PHA. A PHA will generallyaccept that the grievance hearing is a legitimate process for determinationof disputes, even if PHA mangement doesn't agree with the particular decision.Once the grievance is decided by the local hearing officer, the decisionpossesses a moral force_the sense that the dispute has been decided bythe proper person in the proper way.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The hearing decision possesses, as well, the force of inertia. ThePHA can not overturn the grievance decision without taking positive action.The PHA must make the requisite determination under this rule (e.g., thatthe decision is beyond the authority of the hearing officer) and must notifythe tenant of the reasons for the determination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The requirement to state the reasons in writing tends to compel thePHA to examine whether there is good legal reason to reject the hearingdetermination. The determination that the PHA is not bound by a grievancedecision is issued by the PHA officials to whom the responsibility formaking the determination is allocated under the PHA grievance procedure,usually the executive director or the PHA Board). This allocation of responsibilitybrings the issue up for explicit examination and decision by these PHAofficials.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The PHA does not have open-ended authority to decide that the PHAis not bound by grievance decisions_only an authority to reject the grievancedetermination in an individual hearing, for one of the reasons allowedunder this rule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Abusive exercise of this authority by PHA management is potentiallysubject to objection or legal challenge from various sources_tenants ortenant legal representatives, internal legal or management reviews, HUDmanagement reviews. The PHA may have to respond to lawsuits alleging thatthe PHA has not made good faith determinations, or that the determinationsare arbitrary and capricious.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Repudiation of a hearing decision adverse to the PHA characteristicallydoes not avoid the issue that was the subject of hearing. the PHA may proceedwith the adverse action, such as a termination of tenancy or determinationof rent, but may again confront the issue in a legal action to enforcethe PHA decision. If a hearing officer concludes that the PHA adverse actionis not justified, a court may also independently reach the same conclusion.</ITAG>In sum, the claim that PHAs will commonly, casually or capriciously overturnvalid hearing decisions is not plausible. By and large, PHAs will use theauthority for the purpose intended by the rule_to avoid distortion of thehearing procedure by hearing decisions which are <T3>ultra vires </T3>or contrary to law. The old lease and grievance procedureincluded a similar provision permitting the PHA to issue a determinationthat a hearing decision is not binding. Public comment on the present rulemakingdoes not indicate that this authority has been widely used or widely abused.Legal aid comment objects to allowing a PHA to determine that the PHA isnot bound by a hearing decision. However, the same legal aid comment alsoadvocates retention of the old lease and grievance rule, which containssimilar provisions.<T3>(b) Decision Contrary to PHA Rules and Policy. </T3>PHA comment urgesthat the authority for a PHA to repudiate the hearing decision should beextended to cases where the hearing decision is contrary to PHA rules andpolicies (as well as decisions contrary to Federal, State or local law).NAHRO comment notes that the PHA needs to uphold and enforce the PHA'sown rules and regulations for effective and efficient management of thePHA program.HUD has not adopted the change recommended by the PHA comment. The issuepresented to a hearing officer may raise the question whether applicationof PHA rules to an individual tenant is a violation of Federal law. Thusthe hearing officer should have jurisdiction to determine whether the localrules as applied to the tenant are in violation of Federal law, and thePHA should be bound by the hearing decision on this issue.HUD respects the PHA concern, as reflected in public comment, with maintainingthe authority of the local rules developed by the PHA for management ofits public housing projects, and the particular concern that decisionsof the hearing officer may infringe on the operation of these local rules.Nevertheless, at this time the Department believes that these interestsdo not justify allowing the PHA to override the decision of the hearingofficer in the grievance process for PHA adverse action.<T3>(c) Who May Decide Hearing Decision Is Not Binding? </T3>Under theold lease and grievance rule, the authority to determine that a hearingdecision is not binding is vested in the Board of the PHA. Comment on thisrulemaking states that the rule should clarify what officers or level ofauthority may act for the PHA in issuing a determination that the PHA isnot bound by a hearing decision. Comment states that the decision thata PHA is not bound should only be issued by the highest PHA officials.The authority to repudiate hearing decisions should only be exercised bythe PHA Board. Comment recommends that the rule specify that the decisionto disclaim a hearing decision rests in the sole discretion of the PHABoard or Executive Director.The final rule does not contain any additional clarification or restrictionon what body within the PHA may determine that a hearing decision is notbinding. The locus of this authority may therefore be determined and specifiedby the PHA in the PHA administrative grievance procedure.PHAs differ considerably in program size and PHA organization. There arevery large PHAs and very small ones. PHAs do not always have a Board ofCommissioners. The PHA may, for example, be a Department of the municipalgovernment, run by an appointee of the mayor. HUD does not find sufficientjustification for a universal regulatory requirement to locate the authorityto reject a grievance decision in any specific level of PHA management,or any PHA office. There is no special magic to placing authority for rejectionof the hearing decision at any particular point in the PHA organization.For example, in a large PHA public housing program it may be appropriateto place the PHA authority to reject a hearing decision in the hands ofan administrator with line authority over a portion of the PHA program,rather than in the PHA Board, or the executive director of the whole PHAprogram.Comment states that the determination that the PHA is not bound shouldbe made by an impartial party, and should not be a unilateral decisionby the PHA. This recommendation is not adopted. In the circumstances describedin the rule, the PHA should have ultimate authority to determine whetherthe decision will bind the PHA. There is no more reason to place this authorityin some non-PHA ``impartial party'' than to allow a final authority tothe decision of the original hearing officer. The decision of the impartialparty may also be contrary to law. The proposal is also too cumbersome,inserting an additional level into the hearing process to determine ifthe original hearing decision was either <T3>ultra vires </T3>or contrary to law. The PHA decision that the PHAis not bound by a grievance decision is not the last word on the pointat issue in the grievance. Where there is no binding hearing decision,the issue may be finally addressed and resolved in litigation between thetenant and the PHA_such as in the judicial process for eviction of thetenant.<T3>(d) Voluntary Grievance Procedure. </T3>Under this rule, a PHA is generallyonly required to grieve on a proposed adverse action, but may elect togrieve in other circumstances. HUD regulations do not control the formor content of discretionary grievance procedures beyond the scope of therule (see andSection; 966.35). Comment argues that a PHA which expands thegrievance right beyond the field required by HUD should be bound by thehearing decision. Commenters believe that though the decision to grievein the first place is voluntary, the PHA should be forced to follow thehearing decision. Comment notes the ``anomalous possibility'' that a PHAwhich has elected to expand the grievance process might decide that itis not bound by the grievance decision.HUD believes it would be anomalous for HUD to make binding on the PHA adecision in a hearing process not mandated at all by Federal law or rule.If the PHA is free to grieve or not to grieve on any subject, the PHA shouldalso be free to determine the effect of the decision in the review processvoluntarily established by the PHA. A HUD rule which provides that thePHA is bound by the hearing decision, though the decision to establishthe hearing process lies in the discretion of the PHA, would inhibit PHAsfrom setting up grievance procedure beyond the minimum sphere requiredby HUD.As described above, the HUD rule (andSection; 966.33 (b) and (c)) statesthe circumstances when the PHA is not bound by a hearing decision in theadministrative grievance process set up by the PHA in compliance with thisrule. The rule does not deal at all with the effect of decisions underdiscretionary PHA grievance process not required by HUD, including voluntaryextension to additional subjects of the administrative grievance procedureunder this rule (see andSection; 966.35).(2) Effect of Decision on Tenant_When Tenant is Bound. Under the old leaseand grievance rule, a tenant who chooses to grieve is nevertheless notbound by a grievance decision in favor of the PHA, or which denies therelief sought by the tenant. The old rule provides that the grievance decisiondoes not affect the tenant's right to a <T3>de novo </T3>trial of the matter at issue in the grievance hearing_anew judicial trial which disregards the administrative grievance decisionin favor of the PHA.PHAs point out that the old grievance procedure is a one-way street. Thegrievance decision is binding on the PHA, but not binding on the tenant.For the tenant, the decision to seek a grievance hearing carries no risk.Under the old rule, the grievance hearing can be exploited to effectivelydelay judicial eviction of the tenant, since the PHA may not give noticeto vacate before the decision of the hearing officer is issued. In theold system, the tenant has a built-in incentive to grieve, even if thetenant does not expect to prevail at the hearing.This new rule does not carry forward the old provision that a tenant isnot bound by a decision in favor of the PHA. The new rule is silent onwhether the tenant is bound by the grievance decision in a subsequent judicialaction.Comment recommends that the rule should restore the tenant's unilateralright to judicial trial <T3>de novo </T3>on the issue decided at the grievance hearing. This recommendationis rejected. HUD believes that the old system was inequitable as betweenthe PHA and the tenant. The old system also tended to promote misuse ofthe grievance process as a technique to delay legitimate contractual sanctionsagainst the tenant, and also tended to waste administrative resources usedin the grievance process.In the final rule, HUD is silent on whether the grievance decision is inany respect binding <T3>on a tenant </T3>who elects to grieve. HUD leaves this question opento determination by the courts, on the basis of independent State-law principles_whetherderived from common-law or State statute_governing the effect of a prioradministrative decision on a subsequent judicial action. At this time,HUD does not seek to regulate and impose a uniform Federal rule of lawon this question.Different States may therefore have different answers on whether the grievancedecision is binding on the tenant. State law may provide that the decisionis always binding, is binding if there is substantial evidence to supportthe decision, or is not binding (and the tenant entitled to a trial <T3>de novo</T3>). The standard of judicial review may be determined bythe type of procedure used in the administrative hearing, including whetherthere is a written record of the hearing (thus allowing administrativereview of the record). In leaving the resolution of these issues to Statelaw, HUD places the public housing adminstrative grievance hearing on thesame footing as the treatment of other administrative hearings under Statelaw.<T3>c. Non-use of Grievance Process_Effect on Tenant. </T3>Comment statesthat the regulations should specify that a tenant's non-use of the PHAgrievance process does not bar the tenant from raising a grievable matterin court. Comment states that the tenant should not be required to usethe grievance process either (1) as a pre-condition for judicial remedy,or (2) as an alternative to a judicial remedy. Comment states that a tenantwho does not use the greivance process should have a regulatory right tojudicial trial on the issues. The tenant should have a right to judicialtrial <T3>de novo.</T3>In response to public comment, the rule is amended to add a new provision(andSection; 966.31(g)):<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Tenant non-use of grievance process. </T3>The Tenant is not requiredto use the administrative grievance procedure for review of any PHA adverseaction. The Tenant is not barred from using any otherwise available judicialprocedure for review of PHA adverse action because of the Tenant's failureto use the PHA administrative grievance procedure for review of such action.Such failure shall not waive or affect the Tenant's right to trial on theissues.</ITAG>The statute requires that the tenant must be given the ``opportunity''for an informal hearing on proposed adverse action. The statute does notmandate that the tenant must invoke this opportunity for administrativereview. As a matter of policy, HUD believes that availability of an opportunityfor administrative review through the PHA grievance procedure should notconstrict the tenant's otherwise available access to the courts. The statutorygrievance right assures that there is an administrative forum for reviewof PHA adverse action. The tenant should retain the right to decide whetherto use the PHA's administrative hearing process.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Existing Grievance Procedure</ITAG>The new grievance regulation authorize PHAs to make very significant changesin existing grievance procedure_notably by limiting the tenant's rightto grieve to a proposed adverse action andSection; 966.31(a)), and by excludingeviction cases from the PHA grievance process (Part 966, Subpart E, seediscussion in Preamble, Part VI below). However, the new rule only mandatesvery modest change in existing grievance procedure.Grievance requirements under the old rule are more far-reaching, and morecomplicated than the new regulatory grievance requirements now promulgatedby HUD in accordance with the 1983 law. A grievance procedure adopted bya PHA in accordance with the old rule will in most respects satisfy requirementsunder the 1983 law and the new rule.A grievance procedure adopted under the old rule applies broadly to individualdisputes between the PHA and a tenant. An existing PHA grievance procedurefor matters outside the coverage of the mandatory grievance procedure underthe final rule is not controlled by the new administrative grievance requirement.For such matters, no change is compelled by the proposed rule.With respect to PHA proposed adverse action, it appears that in generala PHA will only need to modify the existing grievance procedure in twomajor respects:<T3>First. </T3>Under the old rule (andSection; 966.51(a)), the PHA may excludefrom its grievance procedure a grievance concerning an eviction or terminationof tenancy if tenant action threatens health or safety of tenants or PHAemployees. The PHA may only use this exclusion authority if State law requiresa due process court hearing before eviction of a tenant. Although the 1983law (section 6(k) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k))contains a broader authority to exclude grievances concerning terminationof tenancy or eviction than under the old rule, the exclusion depends ona determination by HUD on due process adequacy of the State procedures.Until the HUD determination is issued pursuant to this rule, the PHA mustgive a tenant the opportunity for an administrative hearing on any proposedtermination of tenancy, <T3>including </T3>a termination where the tenant has created a threatto health or safety of tenants or employees.<T3>Second. </T3>The new rule requires that the PHA give notice of a proposedadverse action (andSection; 966.31(b)). The PHA must implement this new requirement.It might also be necessary to modify procedures for selection of a hearingofficer or hearing panel, where the old procedure for designating a hearingofficer does not comply with the new rule.Some PHAs may be largely content with operation of the grievance requirementsunder the old rule. A PHA may conclude that changing the PHA grievanceprocedure would be harmful to project management or tenant relations. APHA may wish to retain, in whole or in part, the PHA's existing grievanceprocedure under the old rule.Comment states that a PHA should be allowed to keep the present grievanceprocedure adopted under the old rule. Comment states that the rule textshould specify that a PHA may retain the present grievance procedure withminimal modification.In fact, PHAs may largely retain present grievance procedures with modestmodification. Once HUD has made the required statutory due process determination,a PHA may, as in the past, deny a grievance right for cases which presenta threat to health or safety of tenants and employees (but without necessarilyadopting the broader exclusion of termination of tenancy and eviction allowedunder the new rule). HUD finds no need to clutter the rule text with transitionalreferences to ability of the PHA to retain its existing grievance procedure,since there are no special rules for transition cases.Comment recommends that a PHA which wants to modify an existing grievanceprocedure should be required to give notice to tenants, and that tenantsshould be adequately represented in the process for determining the changesto be made. HUD finds no reason to mandate an additional notice to thetenant, other than the required general description of the PHA grievanceprocedure (discussed in section V.E.2 of this Preamble). To the extentthat the PHA's revised grievance procedure differs from the procedure describedin tenant information materials previously distributed by the PHA (or ifthe PHA has not previously given the tenant a general description of thePHA grievance process), then the PHA must give the tenant a general descriptionof the revised grievance procedure adopted by the PHA in accordance withthis rule (andSection; 966.30(d)).With respect to tenant participation, this rule broadly leaves decisionson the extent and mode of consultations with residents to the administrativediscretion and management judgment of the PHA. HUD lacks any plausiblereason for adopting a different and more prescriptive definition of thePHA's process for adopting a new grievance procedure in accordance withthis rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Settlement of Disputes_Informal Settlement of Disputes and VoluntaryGrievance Procedures.</ITAG>Comments point to the advantages of an administrative procedure to resolvedisputes between the PHA and its tenants. By using a grievance procedure,disputes can be resolved without litigation. The grievance procedure offersa less adversarial way of working out problems.The old lease and grievance rule required by the PHA to provide a formaladministrative grievance hearing for disputes with tenants. The old rulealso required that the PHA grievance procedures give opportunity for informaldiscussion and settlement of the grievance without a hearing.The instant rule requires the PHA to grieve on a proposed adverse action.The rule does not require the PHA to provide a grievance hearing on otherdisputes with the tenant. The rule also does not direct the PHA to giveopportunity for discussion and settlement of disputes, either those onwhich the PHA must grieve (i.e., PHA adverse actions), or those which areoutside the scope of the grievance requirement. However, the PHA and thetenants may develop other mechanisms for avoidance and settlement of disputes.The rule provides (andSection; 966.35):<ITAG tagnum="21">``At its discretion, a PHA may provide additional means for Tenantopportunity to comment upon, or for Tenant opportunity to request PHA considerationof, <T3>any matter pertaining to the Tenant's occupancy or the Tenant's rightsor obligations. </T3>The discretionary PHA procedures may be designed forthe purpose of affording an opportunity for informal clarification andresolution of disputes or potential disputes.'' (emphasis supplied). </ITAG>PHA comment largely supports the grievance procedure proposed by HUD, includinglimitation of occasions on which the PHA is required to grieve, and thediscretion of the individual PHA to decide whether and how to extend opportunitiesfor resolution of disputes with the tenants.  Legal aid comment objects to narrowing the scope of a tenant's right togrieve. Comment also criticizes elimination of the PHA duty to providean opportunity for informal settlement of disputes. PHA-tenant disputesare often solved in the informal settlement procedure under the old rule.Informal settlement avoids the need for a full blown grievance hearing.A PHA's administrative grievance procedure may be better than the courtsin crafting a solution to public housing disputes.  The rule only directs a PHA to give a tenant grievance hearing for proposedadverse action, as required by the 1983 law. However, the PHA may chooseto give grievance hearings not required by statute or regulation. In thespirit of the statutory policy to vest maximum administrative discretionin the PHA (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 2; 42 U.S.C. 1437), the PHAshould enjoy the discretion to determine whether to broaden the administrativehearing right. The informal and creative local resolution of disputes ismore likely to be favored by allowing a broad play to local experienceand judgment, than by requiring the PHA to use a formal grievance mechanismimposed by HUD.  The rule does not require the PHA to provide a structured opportunity forsettlement of tenant disputes that do not stem from proposed adverse action,or to provide opportunity for informal pre-hearing discussion with thetenant. The individual PHA is well able to devise procedures for communicationwith tenants, and for heading off and solving disputes. The search forappropriate local techniques to prevent or resolve PHA-tenant disputesis not aided by shaping the local process of tenant-management relationsin a Federal mold. Above all, the process depends on the good faith, flexibilityand openness of the local parties.  Comment states that the compromise embedded in the 1983 law does not showan intent to abandon the informal conference in the old lease and grievanceprocedure. To this, HUD responds that nothing in the legislative historyshows any intention by the Congress to make the old informal conferencerequirement an element of the statutory grievance process under the 1983law. The silence of the Congress cannot be read, as the comment suggests,an implicit enactment or endorsement of all procedures required under theold lease and grievance rule. The Department is not and should not be boundto retain elements of the old lease and grievance rule which were omittedfrom the law passed by the Congress in 1983.  HUD supports development by each PHA of local channels and procedures forventing tenant concerns, or for resolution of disputes between the PHAand project residents. The PHA may establish locally devised proceduresto avoid or resolve disputes or potential disputes between the managementand the tenants.  <T3>F. Mutual Help and Turnkey III Homeownership Opportunity Programs_GrievanceProcedure  </T3><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Mutual Help and Turnkey III_Applicability of Grievance Procedure </ITAG>Grievance requirements under the statute and this rule are applicable toTurnkey III and to Indian housing, including Mutual Help.  The rule provides that grievance requirements (Part 966), Subparts D andE) are applicable both to ``public housing'' and to ``Indian housing''(andSection;966.1(c)).  ``Public housing'', as defined in this rule, is ``housing assisted underthe U.S. Housing Act of 1937'' (definition at andSection;966.2). The TurnkeyIII Program is developed and operated with assistance under the U.S. HousingAct of 1937, and is within the definition of public housing. The proposedrule stated that ``public housing'' includes the Turnkey III HomeownershipOpportunity Program. In the final rule, the specific reference to TurnkeyIII is deleted from the definition of ``public housing''. Turnkey III fallswithin the broad definition of public housing, and a specific referenceto Turnkey III is not needed.  The rule provides that grievance hearing requirements are applicable toIndian housing (andSection;966.1(c)). ``Indian housing'' is defined (andSection;966.2)to include the Mutual Help Program (administered by an Indian Housing Authority(``IHA'') under Part 905).  The Turnkey III and Mutual Help regulations are amended to state (andSection;904.107(p)(1),and andSection; 905.424(g)(1)) that the public housing administrative grievanceregulations are applicable to these programs.  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Mutual Help and Turnkey III_Special Provisions  </ITAG>Because of the special characteristics of the Turnkey III and Mutual Helphomeownership programs there are a few technical differences between thegrievance procedure used for these programs and the procedure used forpublic housing rental projects. These differences concern (1) the definitionof proposed adverse action, and (2) the notice by the PHA to the homebuyerof a proposed adverse action (see andSection;966.34).  <T3>Proposed Adverse Action  </T3>The rule separately states the cases which are ``proposed adverse action''(for which the PHA must give the opportunity for a grievance hearing) inthe Turnkey III Program and in the Mutual Help Program (andSection;966.34(a);andSection;904.107(p)(2); andSection;905.424(g)(2)). The following cases areconsidered adverse actions by the PHA:  (1) For Mutual Help, a propsed PHA (IHA) decision determining the amountof credits to the homebuyer's MH contribution accounts.  (2) For Mutual Help and Turnkey III, a proposed PHA decision determiningthe amount of the required monthly payment, or determining the amount owingon account of the required monthly payment; a proposed PHA decision determiningcharges by the PHA against the homebuyer accounts (Turnkey III EHPA orNRMR; Mutual Help MEPA, VEPA or MH reserve accounts); or a proposed decisiondetermining the PHA's proposed settlement at termination of the homeownershipagreement or at purchase of the home by the homebuyer.  (3) For Turnkey III, a proposed decision that the homebuyer has lost homeownershippotential and should be transferred to a rental unit.  (4) For Mutual Help and Turnkey III, a proposed decision to terminate thehomebuyer agreement (Turnkey III Homebuyers Ownership Opportunity Agreementor Mutual Help and Occupancy Agreement), or to evict the homebuyer fromthe home after such termination.  <T3>Notice of Proposed Adverse Action  </T3>A PHA must give the homebuyer-tenant notice of a proposed adverse action(andSection;966.31(b)). For Turnkey III, the rule clarifies that a noticeterminating the homebuyer agreement or giving notice that the homebuyerhas lost homeownership potential (and should therefore be transferred toanother unit) may be combined with a notice of proposed adverse action(andSection;966.34(b)(1)). For Mutual Help, the rule clarifies that a noticeterminating the MHO Agreement may be combined with a notice of proposedadverse action (andSection;966.34(b)(2)).    <ITAG tagnum="85">VI. Termination of Tenancy or Eviction_Exclusion From PHA AdministrativeGrievance Procedure</ITAG>A. When PHA Can Evict Without Grievance Hearing_Requirementfor Due Process DeterminationThe 1983 amendments require a public housing PHA to establish and implementan administrative grievance procedure (U.S.H. Act of 1937, section 6(k),42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)). The amendments also provide that a PHA:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * may exclude from its [administrative grievance] procedure anygrievance concerning an eviction or termination of tenancy in any jurisdictionwhich requires that, prior to eviction, a tenant be given a hearing incourt which the Secretary determines provides the basic elements of dueprocess.</ITAG>Under this law, the PHA does not have to offer tenant a grievance hearingbefore eviction if HUD has first determined that the law of the jurisdictionrequires due process protection before eviction. A PHA may remove grievancesover termination of tenancy or eviction from the PHA's grievance process.Part 966, Subpart E of the rule establishes the procedure for these determinationsby HUD.In the final rule, the HUD determination that local law provides the opportunityfor a pre-eviction due process hearing in court is called a ``due processdetermination'' (definition at andSection; 966.2; cf., andSection; 966.41(a)(1)).This is a change of terminology from the proposed rule, in which the statutoryHUD determination was called a ``determination of recognition''. No substantivechange is intended by substitution of the new term. The term ``due processdetermination'' better conveys the purpose of the HUD determination_a determinationthat State law requires the elements of due process.The due process determination will be made at the request of an individualPHA. To make a due process determination, HUD Counsel will examine legalrequirements for eviction in the PHA jurisdiction. If there are alternativelegal processes for eviction in the PHA jurisdiction, the HUD due processdetermination may be issued for different eviction procedures within thePHA jurisdiction.This rule sets up a procedure for issuing the HUD determinations with theleast extra or unnecessary difficulty or delay. The procedure allows afull opportunity for tenant comment before issuance of a HUD due processdetermination.For a PHA to exclude grievances concerning termination or tenancy or evictionfrom the administrative grievance procedure, HUD must determine that specifiedprocedures for judicial eviction under State and local law require thatbefore eviction from the dwelling unit a tenant must be given the opportunityfor a hearing in court which provides the basic elements of due process(andSection; 966.41(a)(1)).The PHA's decision to exclude grievances concerning termination of tenancyor eviction must be stated in the written grievance procedure adopted bythe PHA (andSection; 966.41(a)(3)).B. Public Comment_GeneralComment from PHAs strongly supports issuance of a rule which authorizesa PHA to exclude eviction cases from the PHA administrative grievance processin accordance with the 1983 law. Comment from legal aid offices stronglyopposes this new authority for the PHA to evict without an administrativegrievance hearing.Comment in opposition asserts that HUD should reject the ``statutory invitation''to take eviction out of the grievance process. Comment acknowledges thatexclusion is permitted by Federal statute, but claims that exclusion ispoor policy.Comment states that tenants are vulnerable, and need the protection ofthe PHA grievance process. A tenant has the greatest need for the administrativegrievance process when the PHA is trying to terminate the tenancy. Disputescan be resolved in the grievance process. If the eviction is dropped, thePHA saves litigation costs.Comment states that exclusion will force disputes into court. The tenantcan't adequately defend against eviction in the court proceeding. Commentalso expresses lack of faith that the tenant will really get a fair hearingin the local court eviction process.Comment in favor of exclusion states that exclusion will be very helpfulto PHAs, and will be welcome to tenants who want to live in a good andpeaceful environment. Comment points out that the old rule requirementto use the administrative grievance process for an eviction is burdensomeand expensive, that the grievance requirement delays eviction of tenants,and that the tenant can get a fair hearing in the State court. The NationalAssociation of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (NAHRO) states thatHUD should be commended for allowing the use of State court evictions insteadof a HUD-regulated grievance process. NAHRO comment remarks that the rulewill return PHAs to local control, and will decrease PHA administrativeburden and costs resulting from the old grievance rule.PHA comment states that it has become increasingly difficult to evict tenantsunder the current grievance regulation. Tenants and the community wonderwhy the PHA does not act. The grievance requirement undermines respectfor the PHA.PHA comment asserts that the administrative grievance process adds costand time for PHA enforcement of the law. Exclusion will halve PHA legalcosts. A PHA hails HUD for proposing elimination of administrative grievanceprocedure for termination of tenancy. The PHA gives a strong statementof arguments for allowing a PHA to exclude termination of tenancy fromthe grievance process:<ITAG tagnum="21">The only way a tenant can be evicted in [the PHA's State] is by judicialdecision, after a full due process hearing in justice court. If a tenantis dissatisfied with an adverse decision in the justice court, the tenantcan appeal for a trial de novo in the county court at law, and have a secondfull due process hearing on the eviction. The current Rules give the tenanttwo preliminary administrative hearings before the two full due processtrials in the state courts. During the last ten years, the currently requiredgrievance hearing procedures have cost the Housing Authority literallytens of thousands of dollars in administrative costs and legal fees, notto mention the tremendous drain on Housing Authority manpower. Tenantshave learned that requesting an informal and formal grievance hearing beforea three member panel is an easy way to delay a trial in the justice court.This tenant abuse of the grievance procedures and the tremendous burdenon the Housing Authority to provide the administrative grievance hearings,are completely unwarranted in light of the due process hearings allowedtenants in state courts.</ITAG>HUD will implement the statutory grievance exclusion under the 1983 law,and will not reject the statutory ``invitation''. Congress simultaneouslyenacted the statutory grievance requirement for a PHA adverse action, andthe authorization for PHA to exclude termination of tenancy from the evictionprocess (where HUD determines that State law requires basic due processbefore eviction from the unit). This statutory scheme evidently reflectsa Congressional sense of the balance between the benefits and burdens ofa grievance process to challenge adverse actions by the PHA. Where thetenant can get a pre-eviction due process hearing in State court, the benefitsof providing a duplicative administrative hearing for the tenant do notmatch the burdens.PHAs have day to day experience in administration of the old grievancehearing requirement. Comment by PHAs persuades the Department that implementationof grievance exclusion as permitted under the 1983 law will greatly assistin effective management of public housing projects for the general benefitof public housing tenants. Prompt processing of evictions through judicialprocess will enforce compliance with tenancy requirements, including rentpayment, care of the units and compliance with project rules. Familiesare more likely to comply with obligations of the assisted tenancy if eviction,the most serious potential sanction for non-compliance, can be surely andquickly carried out_without the added delay and uncertainty of the administrativegrievance process.PHA comment also indicates that elimination of the grievance requirementfor a termination of tenancy will relieve the PHA of a considerable expenseand administrative burden.HUD concludes that implementation of exclusion under the 1983 law carriesout a Congressional judgment of the appropriate balance of interests, andis very good practical policy. Implementation of exclusion is fair to thetenants affected_who have the legal right to a fair hearing in State court.Exclusion favors as well the general interest of public housing tenantsthat projects should be well and effectively managed.We consider also a number of other particular questions on the exclusionprocedures under the 1983 law.Comment claims that the exclusion of termination of tenancy and evictionfrom the grievance process is a violation of due process. HUD sees no plausiblebasis for this claim. A public housing tenant has a property right to occupythe unit in accordance with terms of the lease.Under Federal law, the tenant may not be evicted without statutory goodcause (lease violation or other good cause). Where the PHA seeks to evict,the tenant must be given a due process hearing on whether there is goodcause for eviction. There is not, however, any Constitutional right to an <T3>administrative </T3>pre-judicial hearing on eviction of a public housingtenant, much less a Constitutional right to duplicative administrativeand judicial hearings on the grounds for termination of tenancy. Many caseshave concluded that existence or non-existence of good cause for evictionof an assisted tenant may be determined by a State court hearing, and thatthere is no Constitutional requirement for a prior administrative hearingon the eviction. The right to a grievance hearing in public housing ispurely statutory. The restriction on availability of this statutory right(the statutory provision that the right to a grievance hearing does notapply where HUD has determined that State law requires the elements ofdue process) is merely a statutory limitation on a statutory right. Congresswas not Constitutionally compelled to provide any administrative grievancehearing on a termination of tenancy, and may Constitutionally establishany limitation on availability of the hearing right. Comment recommends that the grievance exclusion should be limited to thosetypes of eviction most determinable by objective evidence_that is, decidingwhether the tenant has paid the rent. HUD finds no justification for thisproposed restriction of the cases eligible for exclusion from the PHA grievanceprocess. State courts customarily consider a vast variety of contractualor other legal issues in connection with landlord-tenant relations andother issues. HUD finds no reason to believe that State courts cannot competentlyconsider the whole range of legal issues connected with eviction of a publichousing tenant, including whether the tenant has violated obligations ofthe assisted tenancy other than the simple obligation to pay rent. Thereis no reason at all to believe that these broader issues would be betterhandled in the PHA's administrative grievance process. Comment states that in a particular State, the State mandates a grievanceprocess for residents of State-aided low income projects. The comment statesthat the same grievance requirements should also be applicable to tenantsof Federal public housing projects. Otherwise, tenants in different projectswill have different rights, depending on whether the tenants live in Stateor Federal projects. A State may establish a grievance procedure or other management requirementsfor State-aided projects. That is the prerogative of the State. HUD shouldnot, however, attempt to mimic State hearing requirements for State-aidedprojects. The State may, if it wishes, establish additional proceduralprotections for public housing tenants that do not conflict with Federalpublic housing requirements under the Federal statute and rule. The Statemay choose to require the public housing PHA to offer the tenant an administrativegrievance hearing when there is no Federal requirement for such a hearing.HUD has not pre-empted the field of action in this respect. The State mayproperly decide what additional procedural protections are appropriatefor assisted tenants, and whether the additional protections should beidentical in Federal and State-aided projects. C. What is a Due Process Determination? <ITAG tagnum="81">1. What HUD Determines </ITAG>Under the 1983 statute, HUD must determine whether a jurisdiction ``requires''a hearing that provides the basic elements of due process before evictionof a tenant (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(k), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k)).To implement the law, HUD will determine whether <T3>State or local law </T3>requires the elements of due process. To carry out the statute, a ``Due Process Determination'' is defined (andSection;966.2)as:<ITAG tagnum="21">A determination by HUD that specified procedures for judicial evictionunder State and local law require that a tenant must be given the opportunityfor a hearing in court which provides the basic elements of due processbefore eviction from the dwelling unit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2. Elements of Due Process </ITAG><T3>a. Definition of Elements. </T3>The 1983 law specifies the minimumelements of an administrative grievance hearing by the PHA. However, thestatute does not list the ``basic elements of due process'' in a courtproceeding to evict the tenant. Definition of these elements is left toadministrative determination by HUD. The regulation therefore defines (andSection;966.2)the ``elements of due process''. The elements in the HUD definition willassure, in accordance with the statutory purpose, that before evictionfrom the unit the tenant has the right under local law to a judicial hearingon the grounds for termination of tenancy, and that a hearing in accordancewith the local law would meet the requirements of procedural due processunder the Constitution. In response to public comment and further consideration by the Department,the proposed due process definition has been refined in the final rule.The reasons for the changes are described in this section.The final rule (andSection;966.2) provides that ``elements of due process''means that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The court procedures for eviction under State and local law requireall of the following before eviction from the dwelling unit: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The opportunity for a hearing on the existence of serious or repeatedlease violation or other good cause reasons for eviction * * *. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Advance notice of the hearing, and of the alleged reasons foreviction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Hearing before an impartial party. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) The opportunity to be represented by counsel. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) The opportunity to present evidence and question witnesses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(f) A decision on the reasons for eviction before the occupants areevicted.</ITAG>Some comment asserts that HUD's proposed definition of minimum due processelements does not give sufficient protection for the tenant. Comment questionsspecific elements in the definition. Comment states that the 1983 statutedoes not prohibit HUD from establishing broader safeguards for the tenantfamily, and states that the interests of an indigent family should havegreater protection. It is the sense of the Department that the regulation definition in thefinal rule carries out the letter and spirit of the statutory requirement.The HUD definition conforms with Constitutional standards for proceduraldue process as applied to a judicial proceeding for eviction of a tenant.HUD's definition of the basic due process elements affords notice and theopportunity to be heard on the existence of a statutory basis for terminationof the assisted tenancy (section 6(l)(4) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937,42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(4)). The definition of due process elements in this rule provides the appropriatelevel of procedural protection for the assisted tenant. The further accretionof elaborate procedural safeguards in the definition of basic due processis not needed to protect the central legitimate interest of an assistedtenant faced with the prospect of eviction_a fair chance to be heard incourt. The interest of the tenant does not justify preserving the tenant'sopportunity for a dual hearing as mandated under the old rule_first inan administrative grievance process, and then again in State court. ``Dueprocess does not, of course, require two hearings'' (<T3>Goldberg </T3>v. <T3>Kelly, </T3>397 U.S. 254, 267, n. 14, 90 S. Ct. 1011, 1020 (1970)).PHA comment testifies to the waste, delay and administrative burden ofprecluding PHAs from direct resort to the courts. The price for denyingthe PHA direct and immediate access to judicial eviction procedures isprimarily paid by those who live in public housing, and who must put upwith continued residence by other tenants who violate the lease and programrequirements. In the old lease and grievance rule, there is a definition of ``elementsof due process'' (old rule andSection;966.53). In a jurisdiction which requiresa pre-eviction judicial hearing containing the elements of due processas defined in that rule, the PHA was not required to grieve on the evictionof a tenant who creates a threat to health or safety of PHA tenants oremployees. In 1983, the House first passed a bill requiring HUD to establishan administrative grievance procedure ``in accordance with the basic safeguardsof due process'' (Rpt. 98-123 at 175, 5/13/83). Comment on the proposedrule states that in 1983 the House of Representatives intended HUD to retainthe pre-existing regulatory definition of due process, and that there is``no indication'' that the Congress repudiated the intention of the House.There is no statutory requirement for HUD to use the old regulatory dueprocess definition in determining ``basic elements of due process'' underthe 1983 law. The House bill and associated legislative history does notindicate any proposed legislative determination on the point. First, the original House bill required the establishment of an administrativegrievance process, but did not_unlike the law actually enacted by the Congress_allowa PHA to bypass the grievance process if due process procedures are availablein State court. Thus the House legislative history does not express anyintention on the meaning or implementation of due process where the PHAelects to bypass the administrative grievance procedure. Second, the House bill required the PHA to adopt administrative grievanceprocedures ``in accordance with the basic safeguards of due process'' butnot less than as set forth in specific provisions of the old lease andgrievance rule (``andSection;866.56 through 866.59''). The list of enumeratedregulation provisions in the House bill does not include the old rule provision(andSection;866.53) which defines ``elements of due process''. This suggeststhat the House bill did not intend to freeze this aspect of the old leaseand grievance procedure. HUD has the authority and obligation to implement the law passed by theCongress. The due process terminology of the statute is drawn from theConstitution. HUD is not bound to the elements of due process once definedby HUD regulation, but by the elements of procedural due process underthe Constitution. The HUD administrative definition in this rule is consonantwith the Constitutional balancing of interests in determining the requisitesof a due process hearing in a court proceeding for eviction of an assistedtenant (cf. <T3>Matthews </T3>v. <T3>Eldridge, </T3>424 U.S. 319, 96 S. Ct. 893 (1976)). <T3>b. Notice. </T3>The proposed rule definition provided that elementsof due process includes ``advance notice of the grounds for eviction ortermination of tenancy''. The definition in the final rule has been revisedto require ``advance notice of the hearing, and of the alleged reasonsfor eviction'' (andSection;966.2). The change clarifies what must be included in a due process notice. Thenotice must include notice of the hearing proceeding, as well as noticeof the matter to be determined at the hearing_whether there are good causereasons for termination of tenancy or eviction. The tenant has to knowthat there will be opportunity for a hearing, and has to know what questionsmay be tested at the hearing. The concept of due process ``notice'' implies that the notice must be givenin a manner reasonably calculated to inform the interested parties thatthe action is pending (<T3>Greene </T3>v. <T3>Lindsey, </T3>456 U.S. 444, 102 S. Ct. 1874 (1982)). This rule doesnot seek to specify what procedure for service of notice is Constitutionallyadequate. However, when making a due process determination, HUD will determineboth whether the <T3>content </T3>of the notice gives adequate notice of the proceedingand the reasons for termination of tenancy, and whether the State-law <T3>procedure </T3>for serving the notice is Constitutionally adequate.Comment objects that the proposed rule does not specify that notice mustbe ``adequate''. Comment states that there should be specific pleadingof the good cause grounds for eviction, or that the notice must be detailedand complete enough so that the tenant can prepare a defense. HUD does not see a need for more detailed pleading rules. The Constitutiondoes not require any particular form of pleading, so long as the pleadingor other State notice gives reasonable notice of the hearing proceedingand of the hearing subject. There is no doubt many possible ways to expressthe requirement for notice of what is to be determined in a hearing. Therule states that the due process notice must state the ``alleged reasonsfor eviction''. The statement tells the tenant what is to be decided inthe hearing. This formulation is similar to the statement by the SupremeCourt, in <T3>Goldberg </T3>v. <T3>Kelly, </T3>that a beneficiary of assistance must have notice ``detailingthe reasons for a proposed termination'' (397 U.S. 254, 267-268, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 1020 (1970)).Comment objects that the rule does not specify that the due process noticemust go to the <T3>family, </T3>as well as to the <T3>tenant </T3>(the family member who executes the lease on behalf ofthe family (andSection; 966.2)). HUD does not agree with this comment. Indetermination of matters under the lease, the PHA may serve notice on thetenant. The tenant is the legal representative of the family. In accordancewith conventional landlord-tenant practice, the tenant is the holder oflegal rights under the lease, and exercises the leasehold rights on behalfof the occupants, including both adults and children residing in the unit.It is not practical or Constitutionally necessary that the PHA should haveto separately serve other individual members of the family, in additionto the tenant. The requirement for due process ``notice'' does not signify that theremust be a <T3>single </T3>document or <T3>single </T3> process that conveys the necessary information to thetenant. State landlord-tenant laws commonly mandate a two-step notice processto maintain an action for eviction of a tenant. Landlord must first servea ``notice to quit'' the property by the end of a specified notice perioddefined by State law. After expiration of the notice, landlord may commencethe legal action for possession of the property, by service of the complaintor other appropriate process. For purpose of determining whether the State-lawnotice meets the requirements of basic due process, it does not matterwhether State law requires one notice or two, or (if there is more thanone required notice) which of the State-law notices holds the necessaryinformation. In making the due process determination, the question forHUD is whether_under State law_the tenant must be given the necessary informationin advance of the hearing.Assume, for example, that the contents of the complaint contain all thenecessary due process information, and that the complaint is served ina manner reasonably calculated to give notice of the hearing. In such acase, HUD does not have to consider whether the information is also givenin a State-law notice to quit, or whether the process for delivery of thenotice to quit is Constitutionally adequate to afford notice of the hearing.HUD's due process determination may be solely based on the adequacy ofthe notice given by service of the complaint. In another type of case, the notice to quit and the pleading in the evictionproceeding may be separately insufficient, but may be complementary elementsof the due process notice. For example, the notice to quit may adequatelystate the grounds for termination of tenancy, and the complaint may givenotice of the hearing proceeding which is to determine the validity ofthe grounds for termination. The HUD due process determination may concludethat proper due process notice is contained in the combination of the twoState-required notices, although in isolation neither of the State-lawnotices would afford complete and Constitutionally adequate notice of thehearing proceeding. Comment states that the list of due process elements should require noticeof a summary ejectment action fourteen days before trial. The rule (andSection;966.22) requires that the PHA must give Federal statutory notice of leasetermination in accordance with the 1983 statute (U.S. Housing Act of 1937,section 6(l)(3), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)(3); see discussion at Preamble, sectionIV.B). In a termination for non-payment of rent, the tenant must be giventhe Federally-required fourteen days notice.In a non-payment case, the tenant will have at least fourteen days Federalstatutory notice of lease termination, <T3>plus </T3>whatever notices are required by State law. The tenant'sinterest in adequate notice of the eviction trial does not justify extendingthe minimum notice requirement under Federal law, by prescribing anotherfourteen day State-law notice of trial after or independent of the HUD-requirednotice of lease termination. The due process determination by HUD shouldnot be used as a vehicle to federalize the incidents of a possessory processestablished by State law.<T3>c. Discovery. </T3>The elements of due process listed in the proposedrule (andSection; 966.2) provided that the eviction procedures must include``the opportunity to examine relevant evidence in the possession of thePHA''. This provision was intended to allow tenant the opportunity fordiscovery of PHA evidence during the course of the eviction action, butwithout attempting to insist on any particular discovery process.Comment advocates that the definition of due process elements should includea stronger and more precise statement of the tenant's right to discovery_bothas to the point at which discovery must be made available, and as to thematters which must be disclosed. Comment states that there should be aright to full <T3>pretrial </T3>discovery, that tenant discovery should be long enoughbefore hearing so that the tenant can prepare a defense, and that thatfull pre-trial discovery must include the right to subpoena third parties,and the right to depose PHA employees and potential witnesses. Commentstates that discovery should not be limited to evidence in possession ofthe PHA, that the PHA must be under a duty to provide all relevant evidencein the tenant's file, and that the tenant must be given the opportunityto examine governing regulations.Comment remarks that State law may not allow for pretrial discovery ineviction proceedings. Comment observes that HUD has gone beyond the requirementsof procedural due process as articulated by the Supreme Court, in demandingthat the State procedure offer an advance opportunity to examine evidencein the hands of the landlord. The comment notes that in <T3>Goldberg v. Kelly, </T3>397 U.S. 254, 266-270, 90 S. Ct. 1011, 1020-1021(1970), which contains the most demanding and explicit statement by theSupreme Court of procedural due process requirements for termination offederal subsidy, ``there is no mention of depositions, admissions or documentproduction''. Since <T3>Goldberg, </T3>the Supreme Court has suggested a more cautious andcase-by-case approach to the judgment of what elements are required fora due process hearing in different contexts. In <T3>Matthews v. Eldridge, </T3>424 U.S. 319, 333, 96 S. Ct. 893, 902 (1976),the Supreme Court states that in cases after <T3>Goldberg </T3>``the Court has spoken sparingly about the requisiteprocedures''.Some States has adopted procedures for fast trial of eviction actions,called summary proceedings. These accelerated procedures may not includeany provision for pre-trial discovery. In <T3>Lindsey v. Normet, </T3>405 U.S. 56, 92 S. Ct. 862 (1972), the SupremeCourt upheld the authority of a State to establish summary eviction proceedingswhich provide for expedited trial, and which limit the defenses which maybe presented by the tenant at trial. ``We are unable to conclude that eitherthe early-trial provision or the limitation on litigable issues is invalidon its face under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment''(405 U.S. at 64, 92 S. Ct. at 869). As we have noted, comment on the proposed lease and grievance rule claimsthat the opportunity for pre-trial discovery is necessary so that a tenantcan prepare for trial. In <T3>Lindsey, </T3>the Supreme Court rejects the similar claim that provisionfor expedited trial in a summary proceeding ``allows an unduly short timefor trial preparation''.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Tenants would appear to have as much access to relevant facts as theirlandlord, and they can be expected to know the terms of their lease, whetherthey have paid the rent, whether they are in possession of the premises,and whether they have received a proper notice to quit, if one is necessary.''</T3>(405 U.S. at 65, 92 S. Ct. at 869-870) (emphasis supplied)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">By parity of logic, due process does not require that a tenant mustbe given pre-hearing access to information in the possession of the PHA,much less the full discovery procedures demanded in certain comment.The old lease and grievance rule provides (andSection; 966.53(b)(4)) that``elements of due process'' in an eviction action includes an opportunityfor pre-trial discovery of relevant documents, records and regulationsof the PHA. In a jurisdiction where State law requires a pre-eviction hearingthat comports with the HUD due process definition, the PHA was not requiredto give a grievance hearing to a tenant who creates a threat to healthor safety of tenants or employees. In <T3>King v. Housing Authority</T3>, 670 F. 2d 952 (11th Cir. 1982), Alabamalaw did not require that a tenant must be given pre-eviction discoveryaccording with the due process definition in the HUD regulation. The courtheld that the PHA must therefore afford tenant an administrative hearingbefore bringing an action for eviction in the State court. It is plain,however, that the court's decision was not based on a determination thatConstitutional due process requires an opportunity for pretrial discovery,but on the PHA's duty to comply with the regulatory due process definitionpromulgated by HUD. The <T3>King </T3>court states that it is:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>immaterial that [State] eviction proceedings comport with fourteenthamendment due process requirements. </T3>The Secretary of HUD in his discretioncan promulgate regulations which preclude subsidized housing authoritiesfrom denying tenants administrative hearings when state eviction proceedingsdo not require any `elements of due process' which are deemed necessaryby the Secretary. This is so <T3>regardless of whether the regulatory elements of due process are Constitutionallymandated.</T3>'' (670 F.2d at 955) (emphasis supplied)</ITAG>The final rule eliminates the proposed provision that elements of due processmust include the opportunity to examine evidence in the PHA's possession.The final rule does not require that the tenant must have the opportunityfor discovery in the State eviction proceeding.A proceeding for eviction of any tenant, subsidized or unsubsidized, teststhe property right of the tenant to live in the housing. Nevertheless,the Constitution does not require that a proceeding for dispossession mustallow opportunity for discovery prior to hearing. HUD should not deny toPHAs which administer public housing projects the ability to use Statesummary eviction procedures that accord with the requirements of due process.Public housing PHAs have a strong management interest in the use of thesame expedited eviction procedures which may be used by a private landlord.The need of the PHA for use of such procedures may be more compelling thanthe need of a private landlord. Management of public housing is typicallymore difficult than management of private and unassisted housing. The PHAselects its tenants from the universe of eligible poor families, and thereforedoes not have the same latitude as a private owner to select tenants whomeet the owner's admission standards. The public housing population includesmany families with serious social problems. If public housing tenants knowthat the sanction for non-payment or other breach is sure, fast and effective,tenants are more likely to pay rent promptly and to fulfill other obligationsunder the lease. The PHA should have the management tools to cope withthe difficult problems of public housing project management, includingthe availability of State summary judicial process to evict a tenant whoviolates obligations of the assisted tenancy.<T3>d. Other Proposed Elements. </T3>Comment states that the list of dueprocess elements should include the opportunity for jury trial and reviewby a law-trained judge. HUD finds no justification for adding these elements.Neither element is a prerequisite of Constitutional due process. Neitheris necessary to assure a fair hearing on the merits.We are mindful that under the 1983 law HUD is only called to determinethe ``basic'' elements of due process, not to devise and impose a Federalcivil procedure for eviction of a public housing tenant.Comment states that due process should include the right to a written decisionwith specific findings of fact and conclusions of law. We do not agreethat a written decision is an element of Constitutional due process ina judicial proceeding for termination of tenancy. A written decision, ora statement of the legal basis for opinion, is not an element of the opportunityto be heard in the eviction action, and the existence of a written decisiondoes not as such change or affect the character of the decision. It maybe that a written decision, or especially a reasoned statement of decision,enhances the authority and acceptance of the hearing process, or that existenceof a written decision may facilitate appeal of the decision. However, theConstitution does not require a written decision as an element of proceduraldue process in a judicial proceeding for repossession of real property.Comment states that the regulations must require a judicial hearing wherea tenant may raise <T3>any issue </T3>regarding termination, including rent calculation. Commentalso avers that judicial process deprives tenants of a full due processhearing if the court may issue an order excluding particular issues fromconsideration.The rule provides that due process requires the opportunity for a hearingon the good cause reasons for termination of tenancy. If the alleged reasonfor termination is non-payment of rent, then a due process hearing shouldconsider germane defenses, such as tenant's allegation that the rent wasnot calculated in accordance with HUD requirements, or that the tenanthas paid the proper amount. The rent calculation procedure bears directlyon the issue which must be heard_whether the PHA has adequate reasons foreviction of the tenant. We do not think that there is a need for furtheremphasis or explanation in the rule that the opportunity for a judicialhearing and decision on the reasons for termination imports that the courtmust consider issues necessary to that determination.It does not follow, however, that the tenant must be allowed to raise inthe eviction proceeding all issues concerning the tenancy. In <T3>Lindsey v. Normet</T3>, the Supreme Court held that a State does notdeny due process of law by restricting the issues in an action for summarydispossession to whether the tenant has paid rent and honored tenant'scovenants under the lease (405 U.S. at 64-69, 92 S. Ct. 870-872). Statelaw may bar the tenant from raising in the summary non-payment proceedinga claim that the owner has failed to maintain the premises or failed toperform other obligations under the lease.Comment claims that a requirement that tenant pay rent into court pendingfinal judgment is a deprivation of due process. In <T3>Lindsey v. Normet</T3>, the Supreme Court rejected the claim that arequirement for the tenant to provide security for accruing rent (as acondition for delay in trial) is a violation of procedural due process.``A requirement that the tenant pay or provide for the payment of rentduring the continuance of the action is hardly irrational or oppressive''(405 U.S. at 65, 92 S. Ct. at 870).There may be cases where State law allows the landlord to use evictionprocedures which truncate litigable issues, or which require the tenantto post security, in such a way that under these procedures the tenantis effectively denied a fair opportunity for hearing on the Federal groundsfor termination of tenancy. If State law on its face permits a landlordto use procedures that effectively deny tenant's opportunity to a hearing,then an eviction process by use of such procedures does not require theelements of due process. HUD will not issue a due process determinationfor those procedures.<T3>e. Revision and Reorganization of Definition.</T3> In the final rule,the definition of due process elements is reorganized, and is slightlyrewritten for emphasis and clarity. All of the separate listed due processelements ultimately pertain to the question whether the State law requiresthat the tenant has the chance to be heard in court on the grounds fortermination of tenancy. The revised listing of due process elements inthe HUD rule now starts with the most general and fundamental proposition,that under the State court procedures the tenant must have:<ITAG tagnum="21">the <T3>opportunity for a hearing</T3> on the existence of serious or repeatedlease violation or other good cause reasons for eviction * * * *'' (emphasissupplied)</ITAG>The other due process elements listed in the rule are all fundamental elementsnecessary to secure the opportunity for a hearing. For example, noticeis a practical prerequisite of the opportunity to be heard (see <T3>Greene v. Lindsey,</T3> 456 U.S. 444, 449-50, 102 S. Ct. 1874, (1982)).Thus the other due process elements are separately listed because theyare key elements inherent in the opportunity for hearing.In the final rule, the requirement for ``hearing before an impartial party''is separately listed as a distinct due process element to stress that therequirement for decision by an ``impartial'' party is a key prerequisitein affording the opportunity for a hearing.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Determination Applies to Specific Eviction Procedures</ITAG>HUD's due process determination is for <T3>specific eviction procedures</T3>_a set of procedural requirementsfor eviction under State law.The PHA does not have to give a grievance hearing on termination or evictionif HUD determines ``<T3>specified procedures</T3> for judicial eviction under State and locallaw'' (definition of ``due process determination'' in andSection; 966.2)require a pre-eviction hearing containing the elements of due process.The rule states (andSection; 966.41(c)(2)(ii)) that a HUD due process determinationmust describe ``the specific eviction procedures which are covered by thedue process determination''.If HUD issues a due process determination, the PHA may exclude grievancesconcerning termination of tenancy or eviction from the PHA administrativegrievance procedures (andSection; 966.41(a)(1)). In the final rule, HUD addsa new provision to clarify that the PHA may only evict the tenant withouta grievance hearing, if the PHA uses the specific procedures which arethe subject of a HUD due process determination. The rule provides (andSection;966.41(a)(2)):<ITAG tagnum="21">If HUD issues a due process determination, the PHA may evict the occupantsof a dwelling unit through the specified procedures for judicial evictionwhich are the subject of the determination. The PHA is not required togive notice of proposed adverse action concerning a termination of tenancyor eviction, and is not required to provide the opportunity for a hearingunder the PHA's administrative grievance procedure. Unless the PHA usesthe specified eviction procedures which are the subject of a due processdetermination, the PHA may not evict the occupants without providing tothe Tenant the opportunity for an administrative grievance hearing * ** prior to eviction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">4. HUD Review Is Limited to Legal Requirements for Eviction</ITAG>The due process determination by HUD under the 1983 law is not based onHUD's investigation of the empirical workings of the State judicial processfor eviction of a tenant. The question for HUD under the 1983 Federal lawis whether State law in the PHA jurisdiction ``requires'' a pre-evictiondue process hearing (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(k), 42 U.S.C.1437d(k)).Comment on the July 1986 proposed rule states that HUD's due process determinationshould not be restricted to an examination by HUD of requirements for evictionunder State law. Comment asserts that HUD's due process analysis shouldalso consider actual operation of the local landlord-tenant courts. Commentalleges that State judges are not familiar with Federal law, and are notconcerned with the Constitutional rights of poor people. Comment statesthat because of the volume of eviction cases in local landlord-tenant court,tenants do not get a fair hearing. To carry out the 1983 statute, HUD'sreview may not be based on a formal review of State law on paper, but notin practice.Comment on the December 1982 rulemaking also claims that the practicaloperation of State court eviction procedures denies the tenant a fair hearing.The tenant may not receive a due process hearing because of such factorsas lack of capability or bias of the judges, refusal or failure by judgesto recognize or understand Federal law or Federal defenses concerning apublic housing tenancy, rushed hearings, and chaos in local landlord-tenantcourts.Like the July 1986 proposed rule, this final rule provides that HUD's dueprocess determination is only a determination of whether basic due processis required by local law. The HUD due process determination under thisrule will examine legal requirements governing operation of the evictionprocess under State law. HUD will not examine how the local court processeswork in practice.First, HUD's statutory role is only to examine what eviction proceduresare required by State law. The 1983 law does not imply that the Departmentshould or must enter into an examination of practices in the local landlord-tenantcourt, rather than an examination of what State law requires in the jurisdictionof the PHA.Second, it is not practicable for HUD to ascertain uniformly or with assurancethe actual functioning of the eviction process under State law in PHA jurisdictionsall over the country. In many or most jurisdictions, reliable studies orinformation on how the courts work may not be available. At a minimum,researching the operation of the local courts would impose a great costand administrative burden on HUD offices, a burden not required or contemplatedunder the 1983 law.Third, extending the scope of the HUD due process determination to coverempirical operation of local eviction courts would undoubtedly crippleimplementation of the statutory authority to exclude termination and evictionfrom a PHA's grievance process. The need for HUD to gather factual informationon operation of local courts would prevent or greatly delay issuance ofthe statutory due process determinations. This result would frustrate implementationof the statute, and deny the benefits of the PHA's direct access to judicialeviction process in accordance with the 1983 law.Fourth, if the practical operation of State judicial process does not complywith State law, the remedy should be directed to correction of the judicialprocess. The remedy for defects in court process does not lie in requiringthe PHA to afford an administrative hearing to cure defects in the Statecourt proceeding.Comment states that HUD should require that State judicial boards educatelocal court judges on good cause for eviction of public housing tenants.It is HUD's view that this proposal entails an unacceptable and impracticalFederal intrusion in administration of the local courts, and is not HUD'sproper role in implementing the 1983 law. Under the Federal Constitution,State courts are bound to issue decisions which comply with Federal law,including the Federal statutory good cause requirements for eviction ofa public housing tenant. Pursuant to HUD's function under the 1983 law,HUD will determine whether State law requires that the tenant be giventhe opportunity for a pre-eviction hearing on Federal good cause groundsfor eviction.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Defects of State Eviction Process</ITAG><T3>a. Court Orders Which Deny Due Process Hearing. </T3>Comment statesthat before HUD makes a due process determination HUD should consider notonly the specific judicial procedures for eviction, but also ``authority''of the trial court to issue orders which deprive the tenant of a due processhearing. This comment misconceives the role of the Department in makingthe due process determination under the 1983 statute and this rule.To carry out the 1983 statute, HUD will have to analyze due process adequacyof many local eviction procedures. In making the determination, HUD willconsider whether <T3>under State law </T3>requirements the specific eviction proceduresmust be carried out in accordance with all the elements of due process.The State-law requirements are not necessarily located in the State landlord-tenantstatutes or in the State rules for the landlord-tenant courts, but mayproceed from a variety of sources, including the due process clause ofthe State Constitution.State law is binding upon the State judge in the eviction proceeding. Whereit appears upon HUD examination of State law that due process (i.e., allthe elements of due process as defined in the HUD rule) must be providedbefore eviction, then HUD may issue the due process determination. In thisinstance, by hypothesis, the State judge has no ``authority'' to issuean order that deprives the tenant of due process. The issuance of suchan order would be a violation of State law.Assume, by contrast, that so far as State law is concerned, the State judgehas legal authority to issue an order that infringes on one of the elementsof due process_that such an order is not a violation of State law (whetheror not the order violates Federal due process under the Fourteenth Amendment).Then in this instance, also by hypothesis, State law does not require ahearing which provides all the elements of due process. HUD may not issuea due process determination allowing the use of specific State law evictionprocedures in circumstances where the judge has legal authority under Statelaw to issue an order that violates the elements of due process. In theHUD due process determination, the question is not whether a State judgemay <T3>in fact </T3>or <T3>in practice </T3>issue an order which infringes due process, but whetherthe order is a violation of State law.<T3>b. PHA Use of Eviction Procedures Not Covered By Due Process Determination.</T3>When a PHA or other owner wants to evict a tenant, State law may proffera menu of possible ways to evict the tenant. Some procedural avenues maysatisfy all elements of due process. Other procedures may be wanting. Thedue process determination, and therefore the PHA's right to evict withoutgiving the tenant an administrative grievance hearing, applies if HUD hasdetermined that the specific procedures used by the PHA provide the elementsof due process (andSection; 966.41(a)(1)).Comment proposes that the lease should recite HUD's permission [due processdetermination] for the PHA to exclude eviction from the PHA's grievanceprocedure, and should also set out any limitation on the HUD permission.Comment states that if HUD has only authorized the PHA to use a particularjudicial procedure, and does not permit the PHA to use other criminal orsummary proceedings, the lease should list what procedures may not be used.The restrictions on what eviction procedures may be used should be statedin the lease, so that State courts will respect the limitations of HUD'sdue process determination.HUD has not adopted the proposal to list in the lease eviction procedureswhich may not be used. The proposal will not produce substantial benefitsfor tenants, will be a nuisance for the PHA, and may limit the opportunityof the PHA for direct recourse to State eviction procedures that meet therequirements of due process. Even if the regulatory requirements for exclusionare not stated in the lease, the requirements are binding on the PHA inState court as a matter of Federal law. The obligation of the PHA to followthe HUD requirements does not depend on contractual incorporation in thelease.When the PHA seeks to evict the tenant in State court, the tenant may claimthat the PHA has not satisfied the Federal requirement for exclusion. Thiscontention may be raised in the eviction proceeding, or in any other judicialprocedure which is available to challenge the right of the PHA to proceedwith the eviction. There is no reason to believe that the Federal defensecannot be effectively asserted in whatever proceedings may be brought inthe State courts (cf., <T3>Thorpe </T3>v. <T3>Housing Authority, </T3>393 U.S. 268, 284, 89 S. Ct. 518, 527 (1969)).There is also no reason to believe that State courts would be more likelyto follow Federal law restrictions on a PHA's authority to evict withoutproviding a grievance hearing if the restrictions were stated in the lease.If accepted, the proposal would impose a burdensome requirement for a negativelisting of all those eviction processes for which HUD has not made a dueprocess determination. A complete listing of eviction processes that cannotbe used may be difficult and subject to argument. By design, the HUD proceduresto carry out the 1983 statute focus instead on a more precise and positivedetermination_whether the PHA is evicting through specific processes forwhich HUD has made a due process determination.A public housing lease should not be encumbered with a statement of thespecific State court procedures that may be used by the PHA for evictionof the tenant. State law procedures may change from time to time duringthe course of the tenancy. HUD may also issue new due process determinations.A requirement to incorporate in the lease a listing of the eviction proceduresapproved by HUD at the time of initial lease execution is excessively rigid,and not at all necessary for protection of the tenant.<T3>c. PHA Use of Multi-Tier Eviction Procedure.</T3> Some States havea multi-tier judicial eviction procedure which provides a summary processin the initial stage, with subsequent opportunity for rehearing. Commentposes the possibility that in a two tier system, the State may providean inadequate summary process in the initial phase, followed by a due processhearing in the second phase. The comment states that a PHA should not beable to rely on procedural protections in the second tier of the Stateproceeding to cure deficiencies in the initial stage. The comment statesthat if a PHA wishes to exclude eviction from the grievance process, thePHA must bypass procedurally inadequate summary process. The PHA shouldbe required to file directly in a higher level court which provides a dueprocess hearing.HUD will not prohibit the PHA from using any eviction process availableunder local law and procedure, on the ground that some segment or phaseof the local process does not contain the elements of due process. Thatis not the proper role of the HUD requirements for exclusion of terminationand eviction from the PHA's administrative grievance procedure. The purposeof the exclusion requirements is to assure that the tenant has a legalright under State law to a due process hearing in court before the tenantis evicted. The purpose is not to impose a HUD procedure on the State proceedingprior to eviction, or to prohibit a State from using certain kinds of pre-evictionprocedural sequences. The attempt to define or limit pre-eviction procedureswould entangle HUD in a thicket of local eviction practices, and interferewith local prerogatives to determine the incidents of the proceedings leadingto dispossession of a tenant.To implement the 1983 law, HUD's task is to determine what pre-evictioncourt procedures require the elements of due process, not to determinewhat procedures are best. If the PHA does not use the specific evictionprocedures for which HUD has made a due process determination, the PHAmust offer a grievance hearing before evicting the tenant (andSection; 966.41(a)(2)).If the PHA uses the specified procedures covered by a due process determination,the PHA may evict without providing the prior opportunity for an administrativegrievance hearing (andSection; 966.41(a)(2)). For this purpose, there isno need to determine at what stage of judicial process prior to evictiontenant has been given the opportunity for a hearing which comports withdue process, or to prohibit the use of certain pre-eviction judicial processes.However, in a two tier eviction process, a PHA will have a practical incentiveto bypass_if possible_use of local procedures for which HUD has not madea determination of due process. If the first summary phase does not afforddue process as determined by HUD, the PHA will not be able to evict onthe basis of the judicial decision in the first phase. Therefore, whereallowed under local law, the PHA will probably choose to file directlyin the higher level court that provides a due process hearing.Finally, we do not assume that summary process is not due process. In <T3>Lindsey </T3>v.<T3> Normet,</T3> the Supreme Court sustained State summary eviction proceedingagainst a due process challenge.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Relation Between HUD Review and Judicial Function</ITAG>Comment contends that the 1983 law unwisely allots to HUD an essentiallyjudicial function. The comment objects that the law allocates to the executive(HUD) an examination of whether legislative determinations are Constitutionallysufficient. This task is assigned to the judiciary by the Constitution,and is limited to actual cases and controversies. The comment observesthat:<ITAG tagnum="21">Congress has assigned this critical and intrusive examination of statelaws and judicial procedures to HUD's sole discretion. In so doing, Congresshas made a mistake which it should rectify forthwith. If not an overtlyunconstitutional delegation, this is surely a remarkably awkward mandate.</ITAG>HUD's role is to carry out the law passed by the Congress, not to second-guessthe policy of the law. The 1983 law is not an unconstitutional delegationof judicial powers, and does not infringe on the jurisdiction of the courtsto decide whether an eviction complies with procedural due process in anactual case or controversy. Executive branch agencies are often calledto consider Constitutional issues in order to execute the laws of the UnitedStates. In examining due process adequacy of State procedures, HUD carriesout a role explicitly assigned to HUD by the Congress.In performing the role assigned by the 1983 statute, HUD will seek to determinewhether State law <T3>on its face</T3> lacks some requisite of basic due process. This inquirysolely bears on the question whether a PHA may bypass administrative grievanceproceedings for eviction of the tenant, and proceed directly to evictionof the tenant in State court.In the judicial eviction proceeding, a tenant may claim that State proceduresgenerally do not satisfy due process or that the procedures violate dueprocess as applied to the particular case. This is a new due process inquiryin the State court, and is not affected or limited by the HUD due processdetermination. The purpose of the HUD due process determination under the1983 statute is merely to satisfy a threshold question_whether the PHAhas a Federal <T3>statutory</T3> duty to afford a prior administrative hearing. Oncethis threshold is passed, the eviction court has the same powers to addressConstitutional due process issues in the eviction case as in any othercase.In <T3>King </T3>v.<T3> Housing Authority,</T3> 670 F.2d 952, 955 (11th Cir. 1982), the EleventhCircuit upheld the old lease and grievance rule, which allows a PHA tobypass the administrative grievance procedure if State law requires a dueprocess hearing in court. The <T3>King</T3> court concluded that the HUD regulation did not infringeon the Constitutional responsibility of the State courts to determine dueprocess issues.<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * this case does not involve an attempt by HUD to impose its definitionof due process on state courts. [T]he HUD regulations in no way purportto dictate the elements of due process which the state courts must providein eviction proceedings. The regulations simply say that if state law doesnot require certain elements of due process in eviction proceedings, theHousing Authority cannot deny the tenant an administrative grievance hearingprior to initiating an eviction action in state court.</ITAG>The statutory requirement for a HUD due process determination does notlimit the opportunity for the State courts to address Constitutional issuesin a judicial eviction trial. The statutory requirement under the 1983law is an additional procedural protection for the tenant_a statutory pre-conditionfor the ability of the PHA to evict the tenant without giving the opportunityfor an administrative grievance.D.

Description and Purpose of Proposed Two-Step System. </T3>In July1986, HUD proposed to establish a system in which two separate HUD actionswould be required before a PHA is allowed to exclude eviction cases fromthe PHA's administrative grievance process. In the first step of the proposedprocess, HUD issues a determination that specified eviction proceduresrequire a due process hearing before eviction. In the second step, a PHArequests authorization to exclude evictions using those procedures fromthe PHA's administrative grievance process. The first step of the proposed process was designed by HUD to make it easierfor HUD to make a due process determination on legal factors affectingmany PHAs. HUD could make a single determination on due process adequacyof eviction procedures which apply to many PHAs in a State. The second step of the proposed process was intended as a final check,an occasion for HUD to consider whether a due process determination isapplicable for the eviction procedures to be used by the individual PHAwhich is asking authorization to exclude. HUD could consider any locallegal factors or peculiarities relating to due process adequacy of theeviction requirements in the jurisdiction of the individual PHA. <T3>b. Public Objections to Proposed Two-Step Process_</T3>(1) GeneralCharacter of Objections. Public comment objects to different aspects ofthe proposed two-step process for a due process determination. In general,comment generated by legal aid offices seeks to make the process for exclusionof eviction grievances as slow and difficult as possible, while PHA-generatedcomments are interested in making the process as easy and quick as possible.Like the PHAs, HUD believes that the rule should facilitate due processdeterminations under the 1983 statute. The process must not, however, compromiseHUD's statutory responsibility to carry out due process determinationsin full accordance with the 1983 law, after rendering a careful due processanalysis of State eviction requirements. (2) PHA by PHA Determination Is Not Required by 1983 Law. The proposedrule provided that where HUD has <T3>already determined that specific eviction procedures provide the basicelements of due process before eviction</T3>, HUD has sixty days to respondto a PHA request for authorization to exclude. If HUD fails to respondby the end of this period, the PHA request for authorization is deemedgranted. Legal aid comment alleges that this procedure evades HUD's statutoryresponsibility to determine due process adequacy of State procedures. Commentasserts that the grievance process is required by law unless HUD makesan affirmative decision on the exclusion request of <T3>each individual PHA. </T3>By contrast, PHA comment states that a PHA should not be required to askHUD for approval to exclude if HUD has already determined that State evictionprocedures provide basic due process. Under the 1983 law, HUD is only responsiblefor determining due process adequacy of eviction procedures. The PHA shouldbe responsible for deciding whether to exclude. Comment points out thatin some States eviction laws are the same Statewide. It is therefore awaste of time to require PHA by PHA requests for approval to exclude. There is no question that under the 1983 law HUD must make an affirmativedecision on due process adequacy of the State eviction procedure. However,the law does not mandate a two/step process for making the statutory determination,and does not mandate that there must be a separate determination for eachindividual PHA. The statute is entirely silent on how HUD is to go aboutmaking a determination that a jurisdiction requires a hearing with thebasic elements of due process. The Department has complete discretion todefine the incidents of a procedure to implement the statute. In the proposed rule, the automatic authorization to exclude if HUD doesnot respond in sixty days solely applies if HUD has already made an affirmativedue process determination pursuant to the 1983 law. The PHA is only authorizedto exclude when using the specific eviction procedures for which HUD hasmade the statutory determination. If a PHA instead uses other local evictionprocedures, for which HUD has not yet made a statutory due process determination,the PHA is not authorized to exclude (even if the eviction procedures requiredby State law require a pre-eviction hearing with the basic elements ofprocedural due process). The proposed procedure for the HUD due processdetermination was therefore in full accordance with the 1983 law. Under the final rule, the PHA may only exclude evictions from the PHA'sgrievance process if HUD has issued a due process determination on therequest of the individual PHA. The PHA is never authorized to exclude ifHUD has not responded to the PHA's request (andSection; 966.41). <T3>c. Elimination of Two-Step Process. </T3>HUD has decided to promulgatea simple one-step process to authorize a PHA to exclude eviction from thePHA's administrative grievance procedure. HUD will issue a statutory dueprocess determination at the request of a PHA, and for the specific evictionprocedures covered by the PHA request. HUD has collapsed the proposed distinctionbetween the due process determination proper, and the final authorizationfor PHA exclusion pursuant to the determination. There is no statutory requirement to issue due process determinations forindividuals PHAs, or for HUD to passively await a PHA request before issuinga determination. Legal issues involved in the separate due process determinationsfor different PHAs in a State may often be substantially or wholly identical.State law may establish uniform eviction procedures that apply anywherein the State, or for all PHAs operating in certain areas of the State.However, there are substantial advantages to using individual PHA requeststo trigger the statutory due process determination by HUD, and to requiringlocalized PHA by PHA determinations on due process adequacy of availableState eviction process. While eviction requirements may often be the same Statewide, HUD has noprima facie knowledge that this is always and everywhere the case. HUDneeds a reliable way to ascertain if there are special features of theeviction process in the jurisdiction of each individual PHA. HUD shouldhave a means to learn whether the eviction procedures defined by Statelaw for the PHA jurisdiction are identical to procedures which apply elsewherein the State, or else that the procedures which apply elsewhere in theState, or else that the procedures are in some respect different. Information on eviction procedures in the PHA jurisdiction will be submittedby the PHA when the PHA requests the local due process determination. Thisinformation consists of two elements:(1) Legal analysis or other information furnished by the PHA. (2) Tenant comments on the PHA request. HUD can and will make use of legal analysis submitted in connection withrequests by other PHAs, as well as HUD's own legal analysis and research.Nevertheless, the information and comments submitted by the PHA are a valuablecheck on other available information. Local parties are most likely topossess complete and reliable knowledge of local legal requirements. Under the final rule, a PHA may not bypass the administrative grievanceprocedure until HUD issues the due process determination at the PHA's request(andSection; 966.41(a)(2)). There is no exception to this requirement. Thereis no authorization for a PHA to exclude if HUD does not answer the PHArequest in a specified time. Under the law, there must be an affirmativedue process determination by HUD, and under the revised rule (unlike theproposed rule) the HUD determination will only be issued when HUD receivesa request from the particular PHA (andSection; 966.41(b)(1)). HUD will tryto expedite the due process determinations.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. PHA Request for Due Process Determination </ITAG><T3>a. General.</T3> A PHA which wants to exclude grievances concerningtermination of tenancy or eviction from the PHA's administrative grievanceprocess may request a due process determination from HUD. The PHA submitsthe request to HUD Field Counsel for the jurisdiction. A request for dueprocess determination may be submitted at any time (andSection; 966.41(b)(1)).The PHA request states the eviction procedures under State or local lawfor which the PHA wants a due process determination (andSection; 966.41(b)(3)(i)).The PHA must notify public housing tenants that the PHA intends to requesta due process determination by HUD (andSection; 966.41(b)(2)). The PHA submitsthe tenant and other public comments to HUD (andSection; 966.41(b)(3)(ii)).The PHA must submit any legal analysis or information requested by theField Counsel for issuance of a due process determination (andSection; 966.41(b)(4)(ii)).The HUD Field Counsel may issue instructions on materials to be submittedto support the PHA request. <T3>b. HUD Approval to Exclude Is Not Required.</T3> Under the proposedrule, HUD must make two separate determinations for a PHA to exclude evictionfrom the PHA grievance procedure: first, a HUD determination that Stateeviction procedures provide basic due process, and second, HUD approvalfor the individual PHA to exclude eviction from the administrative grievanceprocedure. Under the final rule, the HUD due process determination is asingle-step process. A PHA requests a statutory due process determination.Once HUD issues the due process determination for the PHA, the decisionwhether to exclude or not to exclude pursuant to the determination restswith the PHA, and not with HUD. The PHA does not have to ask for HUD approval.The PHA may elect to exclude grievances on all or any terminations, solong as the PHA evicts through procedures covered by the HUD determination.The proposed requirement for a PHA to ask for HUD approval to exclude wasonly intended to serve as an occasion for HUD to consider interaction ofgeneral State law requirements and any local legal considerations. In therevised procedure under the final rule, a due process determination isissued at the request of the individual PHA. There is no longer need fora separate step to allow for submission and consideration of informationon local legal requirements in the PHA's jurisdiction. The PHA submitsnecessary analysis and information requested by the HUD Field Counsel (andSection;966.41(b)(4)(ii)),and also submits public comments on the proposed due process determination(andSection; 966.41(b)(3)(ii)). The PHA submission and tenant comment furnishinformation on characteristics of eviction requirements in the PHA jurisdiction.The grant or denial of a HUD due process determination is solely basedon legal considerations pertaining to due process adequacy of the evictionprocedures to be used by the PHA. HUD will not seek to second guess thePHA on the management judgment to take termination of tenancy or evictionout of the PHA grievance process. HUD has no desire or intention to impingeon the PHA's management judgment whether to take evictions out of the PHAgrievance process. <T3>c. Initiative for Due Process Determination</T3>_(1) Comment_InitiativesBy PHA and HUD. Under the proposed rule, HUD counsel could initiate dueprocess determinations, but PHAs would have to specifically request approvalto take evictions out of the PHA's grievance process. PHA comment recommendsthat the HUD Regional Office should take the initiative to review Statelaws within the Region, and that HUD should eliminate the requirement fora PHA to request authority for exclusion. Legal aid comment asserts that HUD should not initiate determinations recognizingadequacy of the State process. A HUD due process determination should followa PHA request for exemption from the grievance requirement. Comment claimsthat the scheme in the proposed rule is designed to encourage or pressurePHAs to request authorization to exclude. According to the comment, HUDshould be strictly neutral on whether PHAs request determinations allowingexclusion from the grievance process. On the other hand, another legal aid comment states that a PHA should notbe permitted to request exclusion until HUD has first determined that Statecourt procedures provide due process for tenants. Thus HUD would presumablytake the initiative to make the due process determinations. Following thedeterminations, HUD could (2) Response_Role of PHA and HUD. Under the finalrule, HUD will make a due process determination at the request of a PHA.The PHA furnishes HUD information on eviction requirements in the locality.The PHA must submit any legal analysis or information requested by HUDField Counsel for issuance of a due process determination, including legalanalysis of local eviction requirements. The PHA must also furnish to HUDpublic comments on the local eviction procedures (so long as the commentsare received by the PHA within thirty calendar days after notice to thetenants). The PHA submission may furnish significant insights or information on locallegal considerations that might be missed in a wholesale examination byHUD of eviction requirements under State law. For this reason, HUD willnot make a due process determinations for a PHA's jurisdiction exclusivelyat HUD's own initiative, and without receiving a request from the PHA.However, HUD field counsel may take the initiative to research and analyzeState eviction procedures, or to encourage PHAs or PHA groups to submitinformation and opinions on State eviction requirements. Such broad initiativesby HUD counsel can lay the groundwork for efficient and expeditious considerationof individual PHA requests for due process determinations under the 1983law.The statute and rule do not require HUD to passively await the receiptof a PHA request for a due process determination. HUD may properly initiateaction to facilitate and encourage the process leading to HUD due processdeterminations in accordance with the 1983 law. The exclusion of evictioncases from a PHA's internal grievance process under this law may producesubstantial management benefits in administration of public housing projectsfor the benefit of public housing tenants. Ultimately, however, the choice to request a due process determinationunder the rule lies with the PHA. Under the rule, HUD cannot force thePHA to request the determination, or to bypass the administrative grievanceprocedure after the determination is made. The election to exclude is properlyleft to the local autonomy and discretion of the PHA. If a PHA decides to request a due process determination, HUD has independentresponsibility to make the statutory determination on due process adequacyof State procedures. These HUD determinations will be rendered objectively,based on HUD's judgment of whether State law requirements meet the elementsof procedural due process.  <T3>d. PHA Submission of Request_</T3>A PHA submits the request for a duedetermination to HUD field counsel. The request may be submitted at anytime. (andSection; 966.41(b)(1).) The request for a due process determinationmust (andSection; 966.41(b)(3)):<ITAG tagnum="21">(i) State the specific eviction procedures under State or local lawfor which the PHA is requesting a due process determination. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Certify that the PHA has given required general notice to Tenants* * *. The PHA shall furnish to HUD copies of all written public commentson the PHA request which are received by the PHA within 30 calendar daysof notice to the Tenants. </ITAG>In addition, the PHA must submit ``any legal analysis or information requestedby the HUD Field Counsel for issuance of a due process determination''(andSection; 966.41(b)(4)(ii)). The request for a due process determinationmust be submitted ``in the form required by HUD Field Counsel'' (andSection;966.41(b)(4)(i)). To expedite the legal determinations by HUD, the rule leaves maximum flexibilityfor practical local arrangements between HUD field counsel and PHAs. Statelaw often establishes common legal requirements for eviction, which applyto more than a single PHA. Some requirements may apply everywhere in aState, such as a Statewide landlord-tenant act. PHAs should not have tomake duplicative submissions on common legal requirements, and HUD counselshould not have to repeat from scratch the same analysis of common legalissues. The rule therefore does not impose detailed and mechanical requirementsfor all PHAs to submit specific legal materials. The rule also does notrequire duplicative or unnecessary submissions by PHAs. Instead, the regulationbroadly defines the due process elements which will be considered by HUDon a PHA's request for a due process determination. Field counsel in eacharea will determine the types of legal materials which must be suppliedby a PHA to support a request for HUD's due process determination. To facilitate due process determinations, PHAs may wish to arrange forcoordinated submission of necessary legal materials and legal analysisto HUD, or for common representation on issues in connection with the dueprocess determination. Such common submissions or representation couldbe arranged by groups of PHAs or by PHA organizations. The rule provides(andSection; 966.41(b)(4)(ii)): <ITAG tagnum="21">To avoid the need for duplicative submissions of relevant materialsaffecting more than one PHA, PHAs may arrange for consolidated submissionsto HUD Field Counsel. </ITAG>(2) Public Inspection of PHA Submission. The PHA must make available forinspection and copying by any person copies of the PHA request for a dueprocess determination, and of the materials submitted to HUD in supportof the PHA's request for a due process determination (andSection; 966.41(b)(5)).In answer to public comment, the final rule adds an explicit statementthat the PHA must allow public copying of the materials submitted by thePHA. <T3>e. Tenant Comment on PHA Request_</T3>(1) Regulation. The final rulegives opportunity for tenant notice and tenant comment before HUD makesa due process determination. Federal law does not require that HUD askfor tenant comment on a proposed due process determination. However, informationfrom tenant comments can help HUD decide whether State law eviction procedurescomply with due process. The rule provides that before requesting a due process determination, aPHA must ask for comments from tenants in the PHA's public housing program(andSection; 966.41(b)(2)): <ITAG tagnum="21">A PHA shall give Tenants in the PHA's [public housing] program reasonablyeffective general notice that the PHA intends to request a due processdetermination. The notice shall identify the eviction procedures for whicha due process determination will be requested, and shall invite Tenantand other public comment on the proposed determination. </ITAG>When the PHA requests a due process determination, the PHA must certifyto HUD that the PHA has given the required notice to public housing tenants.The PHA must give HUD copies of all written public comments received withinthirty calendar days of notice to the tenants (andSection; 966.41(b)(3)(ii)).(2) Notice_How and To Whom Given. The rule does not require individualnotice to each tenant or family. The rule also does not require any setprocedure for giving notice to project tenants. The PHA must use a processthat gives ``reasonably effective <T3>general </T3>notice'' to public housing tenants that the PHA intendsto request a due process determination (andSection; 966.41(b)(2)). The noticemust be given ``through means determined by the PHA (e.g., posting in projectoffices, notice to Tenant organizations, or notice to individual Tenantsin the program).'' HUD does not adopt a public recommendation that notice should be mailedor delivered to each individual tenant. In providing the opportunity fortenant comment, HUD is trying to secure information on eviction laws inthe locality. In general, the applicable local laws are the same for alltenants of a particular PHA. Under the rule, the PHA has the authorityto decide what notice procedures will be reasonably effective in givinggeneral notice to the tenants. Under the proposed rule, a PHA would be required to publish notice of thePHA request in a newspaper or other medium of general circulation in thejurisdiction (as well as reasonably effective general notice to familiesin the PHA program). PHA comment asserts that the PHA should not have topublish notice to the general public. Notice to public housing residentsis sufficient. The final rule eliminates the proposed requirement to publish in a mediumof general circulation. Current public housing tenants are the primaryuniverse immediately interested in a due process determination. Publicationin a general circulation newspaper is not a necessary or generally effectivemeans of giving notice to public housing tenants. The target of a broaderlocal publication is unclear, and the benefit of such publication is doubtful.Legal aid comment recommends that the PHA should be required to give noticeto tenant organizations and legal aid programs. This proposal is not adopted.The rule does not require that the PHA notify tenant organizations or legalaid organizations. The PHA's notice to tenants is an adequate vehicle togive notice to both tenants and tenant organizations. Notice to the tenantsis a reasonable and effective way to get tenant views on local legal requirementsbefore HUD issues a due process determination. In practice, organizationswhich authentically act for tenants, and which have strong roots and contactsin the tenant community, will learn about a prospective PHA request fora due process determination when the PHA gives notice to the tenants. Theseorganizations can submit comments to the PHA, and the comments must besubmitted by the PHA to HUD with the request for a due process determination.Elimination of Requirement To Publish Notice in ``Federal Register''In this rulemaking, HUD proposed to publish three types of notices in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>: (1) Notice of sixty days for public commenton a proposed HUD determination on State eviction procedures; (2) noticeof a PHA request to remove eviction from the PHA grievance procedure; and(3) a summary annual listing of HUD determinations and PHA requests. Provisionsfor these <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices has been eliminated in the final rule.On reconsideration, HUD doubts the benefits of national <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication of notices concerning the local dueprocess determination. The requirement to process additional <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices will impose a significant internal administrativeburden on the Department, apparently without affording any significantadvantage to the public. Any delays in <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication, and any required period for publiccomment on a proposed determination, will delay the issuance of HUD dueprocess determinations under the 1983 law.In the nature of the process required under the 1983 law, HUD needs todetermine the due process adequacy of the local eviction procedures availableto the PHA under State law. National notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> is not a necessary, effective or economical meansof securing information on eviction requirements in each PHA jurisdiction.<T4>Federal Register</T4> publication is not a good vehicle to furnishnotice to public housing tenants. Comment notes that tenants do not receivethe <T4>Federal Register</T4> (and indeed most PHAs also do not receive the<T4>Federal Register</T4>). Information on local eviction requirementscan be obtained by HUD from materials submitted by PHAs or tenants, orfrom independent research or other information available to the Field Counsel.Finally, interested parties can readily obtain information on any outstandingdue process determinations, either from the affected PHA or from HUD (seeandSection; 966.41(c)(3)(iii)).PHA comment objects to a requirement for local notice to tenants, and assertsthat HUD publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> is sufficient opportunity for public comment.HUD disagrees. Notice by the PHA to its tenants is a better vehicle toelicit local comment on local procedures than national notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.(3) Purpose and Use of Tenant Comment. The procedures in the final rulegive a reasonable opportunity for tenant comment on the PHA request fora due process determination. HUD rejects comments suggesting that HUD shouldnot ask for public comment. The purpose of the process for soliciting publiccomment is to help the Department make the due process determinations underthe 1983 law and this rule. HUD will consider pertinent tenant or otherpublic comment before issuing a due process determination. Comments on a proposed due process determination should address the issueto be determined by HUD_whether State law eviction procedures require basicdue process before a tenant is evicted. Other issues are not germane. Thecomment process is not directed to securing views on the PHA's local policydecision to take eviction out of the PHA grievance process.Some comment on the proposed rule objects to the requirement for a PHAto give local notice of the PHA's request, or find the proposed proceduresburdensome. PHA comment states that local notice is best left to PHA discretion.The Department believes that tenant comment on law in the PHA jurisdictionwill be very helpful to HUD in making due process determinations. Commentscan give HUD valuable information on legal requirements for eviction ina State or a PHA jurisdiction. By requiring that public housing residentshave an opportunity to comment on the PHA request for a due process determination,HUD has a better chance of getting full and balanced information on legalrequirements for eviction under State law. Obviously, public housing tenantshave a powerful and legitimate interest in whether a PHA can evict thetenant in State court without giving the opportunity for a PHA grievancehearing.Direct notice by a PHA to the tenants is a good way to assure that thePHA's tenants know that the PHA is asking HUD for a due process determination.Local notice will induce comments by tenants and tenant representatives.The PHA submits tenant comments to HUD. The final rule does not adopt arecommendation that tenant comments should be submitted directly to HUD.While the regulation does not prohibit tenants from sending comments toHUD, the PHA can readily package tenant comments with the PHA's requestfor a due process determination. Materials related to HUD's due processdetermination will be easier for HUD to handle if contained in a singlePHA submission, which includes tenant comments and any PHA responses tothe tenant comments. Bundling tenant comments in the PHA submission doesnot compromise the integrity of the comments. Comments must be submittedto HUD as received by the PHA.The PHA must certify to HUD that the PHA has given the required noticeto tenants in the PHA program, and must send HUD copies of written commentsreceived within thirty calendar days after completion of notice to thetenants. Thus, the PHA request may be submitted to HUD after completionof the thirty day notice period (andSection; 966.41(b)(3)(ii)). HUD doesnot require, as recommended by comment on this rule, that the PHA continueto submit to HUD public comments on the PHA's request for due process determinationwhich are received by the PHA until HUD grants the PHA request. HUD willreceive comments and information from the public at any time, even aftera due process determination is issued, but does not think that the regulationshould minutely regulate alternative scenarios for PHA submission of localtenant comments.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. HUD Examination of State Eviction Procedures</ITAG><T3>a. Flexible Procedure for HUD Determination.</T3> The rule establishesa flexible framework for HUD to make the statutory due process determinationon adequacy of eviction procedures required under State law. There maybe a great variety of legal procedures and legal authorities governingeviction in different States and PHA jurisdictions. There may be many localor special factors affecting HUD's ability to issue a due process determinationfor a specific set of eviction procedures under State law. To minimize delay and administrative bottlenecks, HUD has decentralizedthe authority to make the statutory due process determination by HUD. Thedeterminations will usually be made by HUD field counsel, in the HUD officesresponsible for day-to-day administration of HUD's functions in the publichousing program. This process will be conducted under the direction ofthe HUD Regional Counsel in each HUD Region, with oversight by the HUDGeneral Counsel. Under the rule, the HUD field lawyers have considerableroom to work out efficient procedures for analysis of State legal requirementsfor eviction of a tenant.<T3>b. Examination of Local Law. </T3>To make a due process determination,HUD field counsel will consider relevant information on legal requirementsgoverning procedures for eviction in a PHA's jurisdiction under State law(andSection; 966.41(c)(1)). All available sources of law or legal authoritymay be considered, including the State Constitution, State or local lawsand ordinances, State or local regulations, court rules and court decisions,and opinions of a State attorney general. Comment urges that HUD's determination should be based on independent andthorough analysis of State law by HUD counsel. HUD agrees. HUD will carefullyreview probative legal sources to determine, for the specific evictionprocedures which are the subject of the requested due process determination,whether State law comports with basic due process.In this endeavor, HUD will consider tenant or other public comments, andlegal materials and analysis submitted by the PHA. HUD may also make useof information gleand by HUD legal research, or other relevant legal materialsavailable to HUD.Comment urges that the rule should instruct HUD field counsel to cooperatewith tenants and tenant representatives, and should specify that HUD mustgive equal consideration to submissions by tenants and the PHA. The commentreflects a fear that the HUD analysis will be tilted toward PHA interests.The comment reflects a deep misunderstanding of HUD's position. HUD isprimarily concerned that each HUD due process determination must resultfrom a conscientious, scrupulous and accurate analysis of eviction requirementsunder State law.HUD respects and will respond to the desire of PHAs for smooth and expeditiousissuance of due process determinations. However, the weight of commentsor analysis submitted to HUD depends on the intrinsic force of the legalarguments, not on whether the arguments are submitted by the PHA or bytenants. In making due process determinations, HUD will objectively carryout the role assigned to HUD by the 1983 law. The rule adequately statesthe elements and procedures for a due process determination by HUD.Comment states HUD should hold administrative hearings before issuing dueprocess determinations, and asserts hearings are necessary if there aresubstantial questions on whether the PHA follows the eviction procedurerecognized by HUD.The recommendation is not adopted. Before HUD issues a due process determination,there is no procedure recognized by HUD. Consequently there is no needfor a hearing to determine whether the PHA is following the HUD recognizedprocedure. Once the HUD determination is issued, the PHA may only bypassadministrative grievance process when using the procedure recognized byHUD.HUD believes that formal administrative hearings on a proposed due processdetermination would be cumbersome and time-consuming, and would not improvethe quality of the HUD determination. The due process determination isnot designed to determine issues of fact, but issues of law_namely whetherState law mandates a due process hearing in advance of eviction. For thispurpose, HUD does not need public testimony on the facts. HUD needs informationon State law.Information on State law can be efficiently gathered without a structuredhearing process for gathering testimony and other evidence. The regulationprovides a flexible procedure for obtaining and considering all availableinformation and views on State law. The procedure is open to submissionof relevant legal materials by anyone at any time. There is no reason tobelieve that structuring the process as a ``hearing'' would obtain betteror more complete information, or would result in better-founded decisionsby HUD. In the administration of Federal programs, administrative agenciesare often charged with making important determinations to carry out a statutoryscheme. It does not follow that the process for making any determinationrequired by law should be structured as a hearing_that is a structuredpublic process for the submission and consideration of testimony and otherevidence bearing on the determination.It is important to remark that the HUD due process determination does notdetermine whether any particular tenant is evicted from a unit. After HUDissues the determination, the PHA may proceed to evict the tenant by judicialprocess. In the judicial eviction process, the tenant has the Constitutionalright to a hearing, to determine whether the tenant has a right to remainin the unit. In the judicial hearing, the State court can consider bothissues of fact and issues of law which bear on the eviction.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Due Process Determination by HUD </ITAG><T3>a. Statement of Due Process Determination. </T3>When HUD decides toissue a due process determination on request from a PHA, HUD will givethe PHA a statement of the determination. The final rule provides (andSection;966.41(c)(2)) that the statement must include:(i) The name of the PHA.(ii) A description of the specific eviction procedures covered by the dueprocess determination (such as eviction actions brought in a particularlocal landlord-tenant court).(iii) A statement that HUD has determined that the procedures provide theelements of due process prior to eviction.(iv) A statement which summarizes the legal basis for HUD's due processdetermination. The statement will briefly describe the basis for HUD'sconclusion that the procedures meet each of the due process elements.<T3>b. Revision or Withdrawal of Due Process Determination. </T3>At anytime, HUD will receive information relevant to a due process determination,including a due process determination previously issued (andSection;966.41(c)(1)).HUD may revise or withdraw a due process determination at any time andSection;966.41(c)(4)(i)).Such action may be based on any available information which is relevantto the determination, including any changes in applicable State law orany court decisions since the original due process determination. A change in a due process determination may be appropriate because of newcourt decisions or a change of State or local law since the original determination.Other information or new analysis could justify re-opening a prior determination.The final rule adds a provision that if HUD decides to revise or withdrawa due process determination, HUD will give the PHA a statement of the decision.The change is effective immediately when the statement is given to thePHA. (andSection;966.41(c)(4)(ii).) Comment recommends that the rule should state that HUD retains the powerto review a prior determination that State law satisfies due process, andshould further state that affected parties have a right to reconsideration.The proposed rule and the final rule directly recognize that HUD may reviseor withdraw a due process determination. HUD does not, however, agree thatthe rule should create a ``right'' to reconsideration. HUD will decidewhether a request for reconsideration, or a submission of new informationon State law procedures justifies reopening a due process determination.The issue is properly left to HUD's administrative discretion. <T3>c. Copies of Due Process Determination. </T3>At the request of anytenant, the PHA must make available for inspection and copying copies ofthe due process determinations issued by HUD for the PHA (andSection;966.41(c)(3)(iii)).The HUD Field Office for any jurisdiction must also make available forinspection and copying by any interested person copies of due process determinationsfor PHAs in the Field Office jurisdiction. <T3>d. Requirement for Decision and Statement of Reasons. </T3>Under thetwo-step process described in the proposed rule (see section VI.D.1 ofthis Preamble), HUD would first issue the statutory determination thatState law procedures afford the elements of due process. A PHA would thenseparately ask for permission to exclude pursuant to the HUD determination.Comment objects to proposed provisions allowing a PHA to exclude whereHUD has already made the due process determination, but then fails to answerin time a PHA request for permission to exclude. Comment states that HUDshould make an affirmative decision on each PHA request, with a writtenstatement of decision and supporting analysis. The HUD analysis shouldbe available to the public. In the one-step system under the final rule, HUD will issue an affirmativedue process determination for an individual PHA. The PHA may not excludeuntil the determination is issued. As described above, HUD will issue asummary statement of the legal basis for the determination, and the statementmay be examined by any interested party. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Effect of Due Process Determination </ITAG><T3>a. Excludion of Eviction From Grievance Process. </T3>The rule providesthat the due process determination is effective immediately when the statementof determination is given to the PHA by HUD (andSection;966.41(c)(3)(i)).After HUD issues a due process determination, the PHA is no longer requiredto grieve on the decision to evict a family through the eviction procedurescovered by the determination. After receiving the determination, the PHAmay exclude from the PHA administrative grievance procedure any grievancesconcerning termination of tenancy or eviction if the PHA uses the specificeviction procedures which are the subject of the determination (andSection;966.41(a)(1),966.41(a)(2) and 966.41(c)(3)(ii)). If the PHA evicts through eviction procedures covered by the due processdetermination:<ITAG tagnum="21">The PHA is not required to give notice of proposed adverse actionconcerning a termination of tenancy or eviction, and is not required toprovide the opportunity for a hearing under the PHA's administrative grievanceprocedure. Unless the PHA uses the specific eviction procedures which arethe subject of a due process determination, the PHA may not evict the occupantswithout providing to the Tenant the opportunity for an administrative grievancehearing * * * * '' (andSection;966.41(a)(2)).</ITAG><T3>b. Other Grievable Subjects. </T3>Apart from a proposed eviction, thePHA must grieve on a proposed determination of rent or charges, on a proposeddetermination to transfer the tenant to another unit, or on other proposedadverse action by the PHA. The PHA must give the opportunity to grieveon these other subjects even if eviction is excluded from the grievanceprocedure, and the PHA is therefore no longer required to grieve on thatsubject. For this reason, there is a need to define the relation betweenthe grievance process (for subjects which remain subject to that process),and the judicial process for eviction of the tenant from the unit. It isespecially important to determine the relation between a grievance concerningthe PHA's determination of rent, and a judicial action to evict the tenantfor non-payment of rent. PHA comment expresses concern that a landlord-tenant court will not ordereviction of a tenant for non-payment if the judge knows that the PHA rentdetermination is the subject of an ongoing and unresolved administrativegrievance process. A PHA representative notes that availability of an administrativeremedy to contest the rental payment will frustrate the purpose of theauthority to exclude grievance cases from the PHA grievance process ``bydelaying the judicial process/and or by subjecting the parties to the riskof inconsistent outcomes''. HUD shares these concerns. The statute and rule allow a PHA to bypass theadministrative grievance process for eviction of a tenant, but only wherethe tenant has the legal right to a due process hearing in State court.If the PHA chooses to use this exclusion procedure, the judicial actionfor eviction should not be delayed by a pending grievance process. Alloutstanding issues involved in eviction of the tenant may be litigatedin court. The decision and actions of the court in the action for evictionor the tenant for non-payment of rent or for other grounds should not bedelayed or affected by a pending grievance process not decided prior tocommencement of the court action, or by a grievance decision rendered aftercommencement of the action. Once the eviction action is remitted to Statecourt, as contemplated by the 1983 law, the matter should be wholly determinedin the State court proceeding, without regard to any parallel grievanceproceeding, regardless of whether the grievance process was commenced beforeor after the commencement of the judicial action.   To evict a tenant, the PHA gives the lease termination notice requiredby HUD, and any other notices required under State law, including the complaintor other pleading that commences the judicial action for eviction. At thetime the PHA serves the notice, the PHA and the tenant may be at any pointalong the continuum of the grievance process (notice of adverse actionby PHA, timely request for grievance hearing by tenant (or failure of tenantto make timely request), decision by hearing officer on tenant grievance).Similarly, the grievance process over the PHA determination of rent orcharges may also be unfold during the further progress of the judicialaction for eviction of the tenant, through the trial and the decision ofthe court to grant or deny eviction of the tenant from the unit. The final rule includes provisions designed to solve problems which stemfrom the relation between the tenant right to grieve on the PHA's determinationof rent or charges or on other grievable adverse action, and the PHA'sright to exclude eviction from the PHA grievance process. First, the PHA may establish deadlines for the tenant to request a changein the PHA determination of rent or other charges (andSection; 966.31(c)(1)),or to request a hearing after PHA notice of adverse action (andSection; 966.31(c)(2)).If the tenant fails to submit the request in time, the tenant loses theright for a grievance hearing on correctness of the PHA determination.If the deadline has expired, and if the PHA then brings action to evictthe tenant, there is no longer any danger that the judicial process foreviction of the tenant will overlap an administrative grievance processfor review of the rent or other determination by the PHA. Second, the final rule adds a new provision (andSection; 966.41(a)(4)) statingthat where eviction is exluded from the grievance process:<ITAG tagnum="21">``In a court action for eviction of the occupants, the PHA is notbound by a grievance hearing decision issued after commencement of theeviction action. The Tenant shall not be entitled to any delay in or continuanceof the court action because of a pending grievance hearing proceeding.''</ITAG>These provisions will apply both to cases where a grievance is in processat the time the PHA brings action to evict the tenant (i.e., a hearingwas requested, but not decided), and cases where a grievance is broughtafter commencement of the eviction action, but prior to judgment in theaction. Since the PHA is not required to grieve on the eviction, the tenant maynot use the grievance decision as the basis for determination of issuesin the eviction action. The tenant has no right to delay the judicial evictionprocess, and the tenant will not be able to use or abuse the administrativegrievance process as a technique to delay the court process for evictionof the tenant. Instead, as intended by the grievance exemption in the 1983law, the existence or non-existence of grounds for eviction will be whollydetermined in the judicial eviction proceeding. The rule establishes the simple and workable principle that a grievancedecision issued after commencement of the eviction action does not affectthe determination in the action. This approach avoids the very difficultissues of how to treat grievance decisions issued at different points ofthe judicial eviction process: e.g., after commencement but prior to trial,during trial, after trial but prior to entry of judgment, after judgmentbut prior to eviction. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Applicability of Lease and Grievance Requirements; Applicabilityof Definitions </ITAG>HUD lease and grievance requirements are located in 24 CFR Part 966. Therule covers two main subjects: tenant leases (Subpart B and Subpart C),and grievance hearings for tenants (Subpart D and Subpart E). In the 1937 Act, the term ``public housing'' means non-section 8 housingwhich is assisted under the Act (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 3(b)(1)).The statutory term ``public housing'' applies to both Indian and non-Indianhousing which is assisted under the Act. Under this rule, Part 966 tenantlease requirements (Part 966, Subparts A and B) do not apply to IndianHousing. However, Part 966 grievance hearing requirements apply to bothIndian and non-Indian housing. In the final rule (andSection; 966.2), there are separate and mutually exclusivedefinitions of the terms ``public housing'' and ``Indian housing.'' Asdefined in the rule, the term ``public housing'' includes ``housing assistedunder the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 * * * other than housing assisted undersection 8 or section 17 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937.'' However, thedefinition of public housing also explicitly provides that the term ``publichousing'' as used in Part 966 ``does not include Indian Housing.'' As definedin the rule, the term ``Indian Housing'' means the rental or Mutual Helpprograms administered by Indian Housing Authorities under Part 905 (theIndian Housing Regulations). The use of separate and exclusive definitions facilitates a clearer specificationof what parts of the lease and grievance requirements are applicable tothe HUD Indian Housing Program. The final rule provides that Subparts B(lease requirements) and C (termination of tenancy and eviction) are applicableto ``public housing'' (i.e., not including Indian Housing) (andSection; 966.1(b)(1)),and that Subparts B and C are not applicable to ``Indian housing'' (andSection;966.1(b)(2)). The rule also provides that Subparts D and E (grievance hearingrequirements) are applicable to both public housing and Indian housingas defined in the rule (andSection; 966.1(c)).To exclude coverage of Indian housing, the definition of public housingused in the rule is narrower than the statutory definition of public housingin the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. The use of separate regulatory definitionsdoes not, of course, change the scope of statutory provisions which governpublic housing as more broadly defined in the 1937 Act. The lease and hearingprovisions in the 1983 law (section 6(k) and section 6(l) of the 1937 Act,42 U.S.C. 1437d (k) and (l)) apply to all statutory public housing, includingIndian housing. Therefore, although Part 966 Subparts B and C do not apply to Indian housing,the Indian housing regulations contain separate provisions which are consistentwith the statutory requirements for leases and termination of tenancy underthe 1983 law (U.S. Housing Act of 1937, section 6(l), 42 U.S.C. 1437d(l)).With respect to the Mutual Help Program, the Mutual Help HomeownershipOpportunity Agreement in accordance with the existing program rule (Part905, Subpart D) is in accordance with lease and termination requirementsof the 1983 law. With respect to Rental Projects of Indian Housing Authorities,this rule adds a simple statement of lease requirements which implementall requirements of the 1983 law. Subpart A (andSection; 966.2) defines terms used in Part 966. The final rulespecifies that the definitions apply to the defined terms when used inPart 966 (andSection; 966.1(a)). The definitions are uniform for all purposesof Part 966. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Hearing for Applicants</ITAG>In the December 1982 original rulemaking, the Department proposed to combineprovisions regarding informal hearings for applicants and for tenants inoccupancy (see discussion at 47 FR 55689, 55691-92, December 13, 1982).In the case of applicants, section 6(c)(3)(i) of the U.S. Housing Act of1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437d(c)(3)(i)) provides that, where the PHA determinesthat an applicant is ineligible for admission to a public housing project,the PHA must: <ITAG tagnum="20">promptly notify * * * any applicant determined to be ineligible foradmission to the project of the basis for such determination and providethe applicant upon request, within a reasonable time after the determinationis made, with an opportunity for an informal hearing on such determination* * * * </ITAG>Enactment in 1983 of the more detailed and demanding statutory hearingrequirement for public housing tenants (implemented in this rule) makesit impracticable to combine the regulatory hearing requirements for applicantsand tenants. For this reason, the final rule (andSection; 960.207(a)) separatelystates notice and hearing requirements for ineligible applicants undersection 6(c)(3)(i) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C.1437d(c)(3)(i)). As noted in the Preamble to the original rulemaking, ``the legislativehistory of the statutory requirement that the PHA provide an informal hearingfor applicants determined ineligible for admission strongly indicates thatthe Congress did not intend to impose an elaborate hearing requirement''(see discussion of legislative history at 47 FR 55689, 55692). In 1983,the bill as reported by the House Banking Committee would have imposedthe same administrative grievance procedures for ``tenants and applicants''(Report 98-23 on H.R. 1, p. 175). However, the law as finally passed bythe Congress (section 6(k) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437d(k))adds new administrative hearing requirements only for tenants, and leavesundisturbed the applicant hearing requirement under prior law. Comment says PHAs need HUD guidance on informal hearing requirements forapplicants. The old rule (andSection; 960.207(a)) merely repeats the statutorylanguage. Comment says that a notice that the PHA is denying admission should statethe basis for the PHA determination with enough specificity so that theapplicant can respond. The rule requires a PHA to establish a simple but effective procedure tonotify an applicant if the PHA decides the applicant is ineligible forany reason (andSection; 960.207(b)(1)), and to give the applicant an opportunityfor an informal hearing on the decision (andSection; 960.207(b)(2)). Theseprocedures are very similar to the review procedures for applicants toa PHA's certificate program (andSection; 882.216(a), 49 FR 12215, March 29,1984; for parallel factors considered by the Department in determiningthe appropriate level of procedural protection for a subsidized housingapplicant, see preamble to rule for certificate program.) The rule (andSection; 966.207(a) provides that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The PHA shall give an applicant for admission prompt written noticeof a decision that the applicant is not eligible for admission for anyreason. The notice shall inform the applicant of the basic reasons forthe decision. The notice shall also state that the applicant may requestan informal hearing on the decision, and shall describe how to obtain theinformal hearing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The PHA shall give the applicant an opportunity for an informalhearing on the decision, in accordance with procedures adopted by the PHA.The hearing shall be held within a reasonable time of the decision. Theinformal hearing shall be conducted by a person or persons (who may bean officer or employee of the PHA) designated by the PHA in accordancewith the applicant hearing procedures adopted by the PHA. The hearing officershall be someone other than the person who made the decision under reviewor a subordinate of such person. The applicant shall be given an opportunityto present written or oral objections to the PHA decision. The PHA shallpromptly notify the applicant in writing of the final PHA decision afterthe informal hearing. The notice shall state the basic reasons for thedecision. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Civil Rights Requirements. </ITAG>The final rules adds a provision to affirm that a PHA is bound by civilrights statutes and regulations in administering the lease and grievancerequirements. The rule provides (andSection; 966.3):<ITAG tagnum="21">PHA policies and actions with respect to leases and administrativegrievance procedures under [Part 966] shall be consistent with Title VIof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of1968, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Age DiscriminationAct of 1975, and Executive Order 11063 and with related regulations andrequirements. </ITAG>This rule gives PHAs increased discretion in administering the lease andgrievance procedure. However, PHAs are reminded that all applicable civilrights laws and regulations remain in full force. Each PHA's adherenceto the civil rights authorities will continue to be monitored by the Department.In particular, PHAs are cautioned against implementing any policies orpractices which have, or may have, the effect of treating individual tenantfamilies differently by race, national origin, sex or religion, or whichproduce a diparate impact based on these factors. <ITAG tagnum="84">X. Other Matters</ITAG>The Department has determined that this rule does not constitute a ``majorrule'' as that term is defined in section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291.Analysis of the rule indicates that it will not: (1) Have an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more; (2) cause a major increase in costsor prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State or localgovernment agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) have a significant adverseeffect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreignbased enterprises in domestic or export markets. A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50, which implementssection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. TheFinding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection duringregular business hours in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk, at theaddress listed above. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act) the undersignedcertifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities. The lease and grievance requirementsare directed to public housing agencies (including Indian Housing Authorities)administering the public housing program, and will reduce the administrativeburden of the PHA under the present lease and grievance procedures. Information collection requirements in this rule have been submitted tothe Office of Management and Budget for approval under the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520). No person may be subjected to a penaltyfor failure to comply with these information collection requirements untilthey have been approved and assigned an OMB control number. The OMB controlnumber(s), when assigned, will be announced by separate notice in the FederalRegister. Estimated public reporting burden for this collection of informationis as follows: (1) Total annual report and recordkeeping burden: 152,373 hours. (2) Burden per response: .05 hour. (3) Proposed frequency of response:varies.(4) Estimate of likely number of respondents (annual): 3,300 The rule was listed as Item 1038 in the Department's Semiannual Agendaof Regulations published on April 25, 1988 at 53 FR 13854, 13893 pursuantto Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
