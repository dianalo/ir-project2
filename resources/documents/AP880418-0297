On other markets, energy futures advanced; most livestock andmeat futures declined; grains and soybeans were mixed; andstock-index futures rose.   Gold for June delivery settled above $460 a troy ounce on theCommodity Exchange in New York for the first time this month. Butthe settlement price of $461.70 was well below the day's high of$464, an 11-week high.   Silver and platinum also jumped in early trading, but anafternoon selloff pushed their settlement prices below Friday'sfinal prices.   The prospect that military action between the United States andIran in the Persian Gulf could disrupt crude-oil shipments anddrive oil prices higher was seen as a positive factor for theinflation-sensitive metals, analysts said.   But brief skirmishes such as Monday's U.S. Navy attacks onIranian oil platforms and military vessels often have an ultimatelynegative impact on the precious metals, said Craig Sloane, metalsanalyst in New York for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   ``You get a knee-jerk response that's very quick in terms ofpeople rushing in and buying the metals,'' he said. ``But once youreach the point where the buying can't sustain itself, the sellerscome in and it ends up being more damaging to the metals pricesthan being positive.''   Gold settled $3.20 to $3.80 higher, with the contract fordelivery in June at $461.70 a troy ounce; silver was 2.7 cents to3.5 cents lower, with May at $6.44 a troy ounce.   Crude-oil futures also fell back on the New York MercantileExchange after a morning rally that pushed the contract for Maydelivery to $18.92, just short of the important $19-a-barrel level.   ``The market clearly reacted to the increased tension in thePersian Gulf and the U.S.-Iran clash,'' said Andrew Lebow, ananalyst in New York with EDandamp;F Man International Futures Inc.   The setback apparently was motivated partly by technical factorsand partly by statements from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that theywould not reduce their production of crude oil unless non-OPECproducers also agreed to cut production, Lebow said.   OPEC has invited some non-OPEC producers to meet next week todiscuss production levels.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents to 26 centshigher, with contracts for May delivery at $18.52 a barrel. Heatingoil was .48 cent to .83 cent higher, with May at 50.50 cents agallon; unleaded gasoline was .64 cent to .73 cent higher with Mayat 53.30 cents a gallon.   Cattle and pork futures were pressured by profit-taking on theChicago Mercantile Exchange.   Cattle futures advanced above recent highs early in the session,sold off on profit-taking, then recovered to finish only slightlylower than Friday's final prices.   Hog futures ran into some technical weakness late in the day,analysts said. On the fundamental side, weights of slaughteredanimals have been relatively high and the market is still awaitinga seasonal drop in supplies.   ``I think there is this perception that near-term supplies won'tgive you much to be optimistic about,'' said Philip Stanley, ananalyst in Chicago for Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.   Live cattle were .77 cent lower to .13 cent higher, with Aprilcontracts at 74.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to.60 cent lower, with April at 79.07 cents a pound; hogs were .50cent lower to .10 cent higher, with April at 44.80 cents a pound;frozen pork bellies were .40 cent lower to .35 cent higher, withMay at 51.65 cents a pound.   Soybean futures prices closed substantially higher on theChicago Board of Trade. Corn also advanced, while wheat futuresdeclined slightly.   The soybean market showed its underlying strength by rallyingdespite fairly heavy selling early in the session by speculativefunds, analysts said.   ``We're in a bull market and the market just doesn't want to godown,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter ReynoldsInc.   Wheat was pressured by speculative selling and reports ofbeneficial weekend rains in southern wheat-growing states, he said.   Wheat settled 1{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher, with Maycontracts at $3.11\ a bushel; corn was { cent to 1} cents higher,with May at $2.03} a bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 4} cents higher,with May at $1.64} a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 7 centshigher, with May at $6.66 a bushel.   Stock-index futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,where the contract for June delivery of the Standard andamp; Poor's 500index settled .45 point higher at 259.25.</TEXT></DOC>
