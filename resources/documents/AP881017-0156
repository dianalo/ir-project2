(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A lawyer for subway gunman Bernhard Goetzasked the state's highest court Monday to give weight to ``littlewords'' and overturn a gun possession conviction stemming from his1984 shooting of four teen-agers.   Attorney Mark Baker told the New York Court of Appeals thatstate Supreme Court Justice Stephen Crane's charge to jurors lastyear that they ``must'' convict if they found the prosecution hadproven its case, amounted to taking away the jury'sconstitutionally granted discretion. Baker said the judge shouldhave used the word ``may.''   ``That's what this profession is all about, much ado aboutlittle words,'' Baker said after his court appearance. ``The word`must' to a conscientious jury precludes it from perhaps exercisingits own discretion.''   However, during the hearing, Judge Joseph Bellacosa questionedBaker about the possibility that judges might be giving jurors ashow-mercy message with ``a wink and a nod'' if they didn't tellthem of their duty to convict if the case against the defendant hadbeen proved.   Gregory Waples, an assistant district attorney in New York City,raised the same concern in arguing that Goetz's conviction shouldbe upheld. Waples said that for trial judges to be forced to use``may'' instead of ``must'' would be ``a red flag in some cases forjurors to decide cases on their personal predilections and contraryto the rule of law.''   Baker said that if juries weren't allowed to have somediscretion, ``then we don't need a jury, we need a computer.''   Goetz, who was not at Monday's hearing, can't expect a decisionfrom the Court of Appeals for several weeks.   Goetz, an electronics technician, was convicted in June 1987 ofthird-degree criminal possession of a weapon in connection with theDecember 1984 shooting aboard a subway train of four black youthshe said were trying to rob him. The youths, who all survived, saidthey were simply panhandling for money.   Goetz was acquitted of all other charges against him.   Goetz's case drew national attention with supporters claiming hewas a hero who reacted properly to a wave of subway and streetcrime. Opponents complained that his supporters were glorifyingvigilantism.   A year ago this week, Crane sentenced Goetz to six months injail, 280 hours of community service, five years probation andpsychiatric counseling, and fined him $5,000.   On the initial appeal of Goetz's conviction, a lower state courtrefused to throw out the conviction, but did order that Goetz bere-sentenced on the prison portion of his penalty.   The Appellate Division of state Supreme Court said Goetz shouldhave been given an indeterminate sentence or, under terms of NewYork's tough gun-control law, a one-year term with no probation.   While Goetz's attorneys have fought to have the convictionitself overturned and get a new trial on the weapons possessioncharge, they have favored a one-year jail term rather than sixmonths. Because of a quirk in New York's law, the six-monthsentence meant Goetz would have had to serve at least four monthsbefore he could be released, while with a one-year sentence hecould have been freed after just two months.   Baker said Goetz is ``trying to get on with his life'' and``does travel around the country servicing his clients'' as anelectronics expert.   He said that while Goetz still rides the subway, he probablydoesn't carry a gun.   ``I certainly hope not,'' said Baker. ``I don't want to have togo through this again.''</TEXT></DOC>
