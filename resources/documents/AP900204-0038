Hundreds of his loyalists have paid him homage daily atLebanon's shell-shattered presidential palace, which he has turnedinto the ``home of the people.''   Children have smashed open their clay piggy banks at Aoun's feetwhile businessmen spill wads of banknotes from plastic bags to aidwhat many others see as a hopeless campaign to drive the powerfulSyrian army out of Lebanon.   To the Syrians and their allies, Aoun is someone whose lust forpower not only blocks efforts to end Lebanon's 14-year-old civilwar but could unleash more bloodshed and destroy what's left of thecountry.   ``A clown, a clever clown,'' the Druse Moslem chieftain WalidJumblatt called him.   Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, described him as``nothing but a television show.''   But Aoun is a champion to the young people in the Christianenclave ringed on three sides by hostile forces and by theMediterranean on the other.   An estimated half of the 1 million Christians trapped inside theenclave support the general. Others, like the right-wingPhalangists and the Lebanese Forces militia, oppose him.   Since Tuesday, Aoun has waged a savage offense in the Christianenclave to crush the Lebanese Forces but so far has failed to doso. At least 200 people have been killed and 900 wounded, mostlycivilians, in the deadly fighting that has sent an estimated500,000 people to basement bomb shelters.   Before the most recent fighting, young women at the Ouragannight club in Christian east Beirut would flash V-for-Victory signswith their fingers as they danced and shout ``Aoun! Aoun!''   In other discos, youngsters sang ``General, General,'' a paeanof praise for Aoun set to the tune of the Little Richard classic``Tutti Frutti.''      The Arabic-language song ridicules rival Christian and Moslemleaders who endorsed an Arab League peace plan in Saudi Arabia lastOctober under which Elias Hrawi was elected president of Lebanon onNov. 24.   Aoun, whose 20,000 soldiers control the enclave, rejects theaccord on grounds that it does not guarantee the withdrawal of the40,000 Syrian soldiers in Lebanon.   They were deployed under a 1976 Arab League peacekeepingmandate. Aoun charges they betrayed that mandate by openly sidingwith the Moslems and leftists.   All 45 foreign ambassadors accredited in Lebanon have shunnedAoun since Hrawi's election in November. But the general pledges tocontinue the ``war of liberation'' he launched in March 1989 todrive out the Syrians, even though his forces are heavilyoutnumbered.   At least 929 people were killed and 2,744 wounded before theguns were silenced by an Arab League cease-fire Sept. 22.   Hrawi, who has officially removed Aoun as Lebanon's armycommander and interim prime minister, wants the presidential palaceso he can rule from the symbol of state authority. Aoun refuses torecognize Hrawi as president or vacate the palace, which is mostlyin ruins.   Some of Aoun's supporters look upon him with a religious fervor.   ``Jesus Christ is our savior in heaven and Michel Aoun is ourJesus and our savior on earth,'' a woman commented in a broadcastby Aoun's Radio Lebanon.   Some Maronite Catholics even hold christenings and other churchrituals in the palace courtyard, strung with lights that spell outin Arabic ``God bless our home.''   The general has come up from his bunker, two stories under thepalace, almost every day to deliver a political sermon to hisfollowers.   His speeches, delivered from behind an armored shield drapedwith the Lebanese flag, are often interrupted by shouts of ``Syriaget out'' and ``With our blood and souls we sacrifice ourselves toyou, O General.''   When winter rains soak them, supporters amend the chant: ``Withour flu we sacrifice ourselves to you.''   Aoun's officers exhort the crowds to shout louder above thetaped cheers blaring from loudspeakers while the TV cameras roll.   When it looked as if the Syrians were going to attack Baabda inOctober, thousands of Aoun's young loyalists formed a ``humanshield'' around the palace.   About 500 are still camping out in dozens of colored tentsnestled among the trees around the palace.   With the winter weather, the tents are mostly empty during theday. But they're crowded at weekends.   ``We stay up till dawn, dancing,'' said John, who did not wanthis full name used because he often slips into west Beirut, thecapital's Moslem sector. ``The best parties we have are the ones wehold here.   ``Why shouldn't we party? We've won the battle against theSyrians,'' he added, seemingly oblivious to prospect of a possiblemilitary assault to dislodge Aoun from the palace.</TEXT></DOC>
