Others in the capital, fearing more battles in coming weeks,closed up their homes and headed for refuge with relatives orabroad.   Today's calm followed two days of combat that forced theevacuation of many people from the city's wealthy neighborhoods,including nearly 300 Americans.   Elsewhere, assault rifle fire was heard outside Zacatecoluca, aprovincial capital 25 miles southeast of San Salvador, residentsreported. Two O-2 observation planes fired several rockets atsuspected guerrilla positions outside the city of 75,000 people.   For the first time in the 10-year-old civil war, the guerrillasreportedly fired a surface-to-air missile on Wednesday, inZacatecoluca.   The SAM-7 fired at a A-37 jet fighter missed its mark, but airforce pilots obviously were worried about the missiles.Zacatecoloca residents, contacted by telephone, said the O-2s wereflying very low, which makes them harder to hit with the missilesbut easier to hit with rifle fire.   A total of 282 Americans, many living in two San Salvadorneighborhoods under attack this week, fled the country Thursdaywhen the guerrillas declared a six-hour truce. U.S. Embassypersonnel and dependents were among those who departed in twochartered planes.   The neighborhoods, on the west and southwest side of the city,were the scene of a surprise rebel incursion late Tuesday and earlyWednesday that turned their stately tree-lined streets andcarefully tended lawns into battle zones.   Leaders of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front rebelorganization said the invasion was part of the rebel's biggestoffensive in the decade-old war, which was launched Nov. 11.   Infiltrating in small groups under cover of darkness, theguerrillas had seized and entrenched themselves in about 40 homesin the neighborhoods.   There were no reports of civilian casualties from the fiercefighting. The number of combatants killed was not known, althoughreporters at the time counted 11 bodies in battle gear lying in thearea.   By nightfall Thursday, when a dusk-to-dawn curfew went intoeffect, the rebels vanished as silently as they had come and nomore shooting could be heard.   But the neighborhoods remained littered with spent cartridges,burned-out luxury cars, downed power lines, and some damaged homesand mansions _ and a few rebel dead.   One of the bodies in Escalon had been burned by soldiers anddumped, headfirst into a mesh trash can outside a mansion, a crudecardboard sign scrawled with a skull and crossbones jammed besidethe charred remains.   Written on the piece of cardboard was a sign in Spanish sayingthe soldiers take no prisoners. ``There is no man, no law thatholds us back,'' the sign added.   One infantryman with a shoulder-length mop of hair lounged bythe trash can. ``He thought he'd scare us,'' the soldier explainedlaughing, ``We burned him.''   Before departing, the rebels set the National Information Centerablaze.   The center was set up Nov. 12, when the government suspendedconstitutional guarantees, declared a state-of-siege, imposedcensorship on Salvadoran news media and forced the networks tobroadcast its news programs several hours every day.   President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government Sunday accusedNicaragua's leftist Sandinista government of smuggling the missilesand other military supplies to the rebels and suspended diplomaticrelations with the neighboring country.   Cristani denounced the Sandinistas a day after a two smallplanes were caught reportedly ferrying the military hardware.   He said both planes had taken off from Nicaragua; Nicaragua'spresident, Daniel Ortega, did not deny the charge.   The United States, which has been supporting a succession ofSalvadoran governments with military and economic aid, protested tothe Soviet Union, which had been supplying the Sandinistasregularly with weapons over the years.   President Bush said he would also bring up the issue during asummit meeting he is holding off the coast of Malta with SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev.   More than 71,000 people have been killed, most of themcivilians, since the civil war began Oct. 15, 1979, according tohuman rights groups.   On Thursday, the military searched the homes of two U.S.free-lance journalists and that of Ricardo Chacon, the Salvadoranbureau chief of the Spanish news agency ACAN-EFE, and warned newsagencies to be ``objective'' in their reporting.</TEXT></DOC>
