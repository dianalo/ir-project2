Adapted or adaptable to different energy sources, urban heatingnetworks fit into a long term strategy and their economic scope is, atthe same time, international (buying fuels on foreign markets), national(making use of national source of energy ) and regional or local (developmentwork on equipment). A computer- Assisted Maintenance Management (CAMM)software program can produce precise forecasts for maintenance budgets,and during operation will help with keeping to objectives and with thecontinual search for quality improvements. This program has been usedon various networks, at Chelles (using geothermal energy) and at Lille,Evry and Nice (incinerating urban refuse), where it has shown its valuein heat production and distribution networks using various sources ofenergy.</TEXT></DOC>
