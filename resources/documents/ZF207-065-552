And how can weimplement strategic systems?andM;Strategic Systems AnalysisandM;Before a business can implement strategic systems, of course, it must firstundergo a strategic systems analysis, a technique highly relevant tocorporate executives.andP;  Strategic systems analysis is often based on a modelof the future, a model of technology.andP;  The model should predict at whatpoints in time various technologies will become available and what businessopportunities will result from that technology.andM;These opportunities need to be assessed by a high-level workshop that canpresent to top executives the new types of technology likely to affect theirbusiness.andP;  New technology may either enable them to attack their competitionmore effectively or else put them in danger of being attacked by the otherside.andM;Every managing director is concerned about who could take away his or herbusiness.andP;  Often that business is vulnerable to attack by other people whoare using better technology.andP;  And sometimes those attacks come from overseas.andM;The world of industry is feeling intense, international competitivepressures.andP;  The Chinese are building television sets at half the price of theJapanese, for example.andP;  And that's just the beginning.andP;  The manufacturingexport activity in China is going to grow enormously.andP;  Just as the Japaneseare taking our industry away from us with high technology, the Chinese willtry to do the same with cheap labor.andM;To protect ourselves from these competitive pressures, we must use ourintelligence more efficiently than our competitors do.andP;  We must build betterhigh-productivity facilities and use technology in a better way.andP;  We need touse strategic systems analysis to identify the changes in technology that arelikely to occur in the near future.andP;  We need to translate these changes intechnology into actions that business people and, in some cases, governmentsshould take.andM;For strategic systems analysis, I use a computer model of future technologycoupled to a model of potential business opportunities.andP;  By linking thesemodels together, it's possible to build the connections that enable a managerto understand the applications likely to be of strategic importance.andP;  Thesemodels allow an analysis of how technology is changing and how technology maybe used to exploit new business opportunities.andM;The model of future technology is a personal tool that I find very useful inunderstanding the interactions among a wide range of developing technologies.andO;Scarcely a week goes by that I don't add something to the model.andM;The basic layer of the model is concerned with components of technology, suchas the growth in processing speed and complexity of microcomputers, theexpansion in storage capacity of optical disks, the increase in transmissionspeed of optical fibers, the introduction of neurocomputers and so on.andM;If you understand how the basic components will evolve in the future, thenyou can ask: ''Given these components, what types of powerful machines ordifferent types of machines can we build?''andM;The second part of the model relates to new kinds of applications madepossible by more powerful computers and new types of hardware.andP;  Other partsof the model evaluate how new technology and applications will changeworkers' jobs and also examine the major social implications of the changesthat are described in the model.andM;The model is expanded by means of interactions with major industry groups toget their views of how they think their businesses are likely to evolve.andO;Industry groups include financial, manufacturing, information systems,government, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, automotive, broadcasting,publishing, telecommunications and so on.andP;  Joint-partnership studies withdifferent industry groups will evaluate how future technology will changetheir business.andM;As technology evolves, some corporations will seize the opportunity to buildstrategic applications before their competitors.andP;  If we look at the airlinebusiness, most people know that the American Airlines Sabre system was anenormous strategic success that took advantage of new computer technology.andO;In 1975, Max Hopper, the information-services executive at American Airlinesproposed: ''Let's build a system in which we can put terminals into everytravel agent's office.''andM;It turned out to be exceedingly difficult to build such a system, but the netresult of the implementation of the Sabre system was a major increase inbookings for American Airlines relative to its competition and substantialincreases in profit.andP;  The system has had a significant effect on theoperation of the airline, and it has enabled American Airlines to becomeAmerica's most profitable airline.andM;The return on investment from the Sabre system is much higher than the returnfrom flying airplanes.andP;  United Airlines pursued a similar strategy and wasalso successful.andM;What was the difference between American Airlines or United and the otherairlines that went bankrupt or were driven to the edge of bankruptcy?andM;The difference was that the successful airlines used technology better.andP;  Theywere using technology before other corporations realized its strategicimplications.andP;  When the other airlines recognized the strategic threat, theyoften found that they had been locked out.andP;  Travel agents already hadreservation terminals from American Airlines or United on their desks andthey didn't need additional systems.andM;Eyes on EuropeandM;Following its success with the Sabre system, American Airlines started tolook to Europe where there are numerous small airlines and large numbers oftravel agents.andP;  American Airlines set out to give European travel agentsterminals that could be put on-line to Dallas, providing the same service inEurope as in America.andP;  That caused a great commotion in the travel businessin Europe.andM;Some of the airlines chose to compete with this same technology.andP;  Otherschose to hitch themselves to American's star.andP;  Still others decided to asktheir governments to intervene.andM;What eventually happened was that two consortia were initiated, each buildinga very difficult and complex system, one called Amadeus and the other,Galileo.andP;  Both systems are high-technology attempts to fight off the attackfrom the other side of the Atlantic.andP;  And both underscore the growingintensity of the technology battle.andM;Next week, we'll look at new computer technologies that will have greatstrategic importance in the future.andM;----------The James Martin Productivity Series, an information service updatedquarterly, is available through High Productivity Software Inc., ofMarblehead, Mass.andP;
