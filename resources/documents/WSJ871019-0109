The normally harmonious relations between Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, and the Finance Ministry in Bonn were broken last week in a rare public exchange between Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg. The dispute is over Bonn's plan to impose a 10% withholding tax on interest income as a way to help finance the government's tax-reduction package. But it highlights a much deeper rift between the two men. The real issue is a disagreement that has been simmering for months between Germany's two most important economic leaders over the direction of the economy and what should be done about it.    The dissension comes amid renewed complaining by the U.S. Last week, Treasury Secretary James Baker, in an attempt to calm jittery financial markets, took the Germans to task for permitting interest rates to rise. Mr. Baker suggested the U.S. might seek to lower the value of the dollar against the German mark if West Germany permitted rates to rise further, though yesterday he denied that it had yet embarked upon such a course.    As a peace offering to the U.S., Mr. Poehl has been privately urging Mr. Stoltenberg for a year to advance $7.6 billion in tax cuts scheduled for Jan. 1. The Bundesbank chief is concerned about the weakness of the German economy, which is unlikely to achieve the government's official target of 2% growth this year. Mr. Stoltenberg, however, has steadfastly refused to allow higher public spending or deeper tax cuts. Since assuming his position five years ago, the finance minister has made fiscal austerity his chief strategy for achieving non-inflationary growth. Because his opinion carries more weight in Bonn, the moves that Mr. Poehl advocates have almost no chance of becoming government policy.    Besides seeing economic benefit in fiscal stimulants from the Finance Ministry, Mr. Poehl also knows such action would take some of the heat off the Bundesbank by giving it more room to maneuver in setting its monetary policy. He needs that room now, as the bank's governing council clamors for higher interest rates to control the German money supply. His standard refrain these days is that &quot;the Bundesbank has done everything it can to stimulate the economy&quot; through permitting the money supply to expand, and he pointedly suggests that the ball is in the other court, on the fiscal side. &quot;The Finance Ministry's fiscal policy is putting a lot of pressure on the Bundesbank,&quot; says Klaus Friedrich, who follows European economic affairs at the Institute of International Finance in Washington.    Mr. Poehl said last week that he feared Bonn's withholding tax could drive up German interest rates. While that is a real possibility, Mr. Stoltenberg issued a terse statement declaring that he &quot;doesn't share the fears of the Bundesbank president.&quot;    Mr. Friedrich contends that the Bundesbank chief's comments could also be interpreted as his attempt &quot;to lay the blame for higher interest rates at Stoltenberg's doorstep&quot; and, perhaps, to divert attention from the Bundesbank's recent actions.    Indeed, while the Finance Ministry has helped push the Bundesbank into a corner, it is the central bank that is currently raising interest rates. Since July the rate banks pay for temporary liquidity has risen 30 basis points, to 3.85% from 3.55%, a direct result of the Bundesbank's credit-tightening policies. The Finance Ministry triggered a sharp rise in bond yields and money-market rates with its proposed withholding tax. But the markets have since settled down.    Rather than the direct interest-rate implications of the tax, what Mr. Poehl probably fears most is the damage it might do to Frankfurt's standing as a world financial center. Mr. Poehl, who envisions a day when Frankfurt might rival London, undoubtedly is rankled because he had hoped the Finance Ministry would lessen its meddling in the financial community, which the Bundesbank considers its domain. The government already imposes a tax on all securities transactions, a levy which Mr. Poehl has tried vainly to rescind.    More to the point, the Bundesbank president undoubtedly resents the Finance Ministry again boxing him in. The tax is, in a sense, a threat to the central bank's control over interest rates because it could eventually force some investors to move away from German capital markets, pushing rates higher.    Since the retirement of Paul Volcker in August as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Mr. Poehl has assumed the mantle of the world's senior central banker. But it is a 17-member council that governs the Bundesbank, and lately the board has voted to tighten credit over the objections of Mr. Poehl. The hard-liners fear that the continued strong growth in the German money supply could lead to higher inflation.    Mr. Stoltenberg, too, is cornered -- and, as a result, relations between the Bundesbank and the Finance Ministry probably won't improve. The government's standing has been weakened this year in a series of election setbacks and the finance minister needs the withholding tax to raise revenue and to counter rising criticism that the entire tax package is too costly.    Given the current political environment, Mr. Stoltenberg has &quot;had to make some concessions,&quot; says Michael Glos, a government spokesman on tax affairs. &quot;I think he feels fortunate to have kept the tax program intact.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
