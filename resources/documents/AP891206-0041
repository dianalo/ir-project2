Attorney General Michael Bowers' decision came Tuesday, a dayafter a three-judge federal panel in Savannah released a decisionordering a federal review of 48 judgeships for racialdiscrimination.   Bowers has until Jan. 1 to submit information to federalofficials, who then would have 60 days to file objections to any ofthe judgeships.   Six of the state's 137 Superior Court judges are black. Thestate's population is almost 30 percent black.   The panel _ consisting of two U.S. District Court judges and onefederal appeals judge _ said Superior Court judges may completetheir terms but may not seek re-election until the state obtainsclearance of their posts.   The panel also said the state may not fill five new judgeshipscreated this year until the Justice Department approves them.   All 53 of the judgeships are scheduled to be filled by stateelections in 1990.   At an Atlanta news conference, Bowers said he would comply withthe federal order but he wasn't ruling out the possibility of astate appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.   The federal court ruling came in a lawsuit filed by the AmericanCivil Liberties Union; state Rep. Tyrone Brooks, a Fulton CountyDemocrat; and others who contend the state's judicial election lawsare discriminatory.   Laughlin McDonald, an ACLU attorney handling the case, said hewas surprised the state did not maintain its hard-line defense.   ``I'm glad they are going to submit the information to theJustice Department,'' McDonald said. ``They should have done it along time ago.''   The lawsuit contends 48 judgeships created since Nov. 1, 1964,violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act because they were not``pre-cleared'' by the Justice Department as the law requires. TheJustice Department did clear 29 other judgeships, finding nodiscrimination.   Superior Court judges are elected circuitwide by majority voteto designated seats. The circuit sometimes covers several counties.   Brooks wants judges to be elected in district elections, butBowers said such a practice would be the ``antithesis'' ofrepresentative government because judges hear cases from all over acircuit, not just an elected district.</TEXT></DOC>
