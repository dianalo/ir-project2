Michael Dukakis.   ``Every elementary school child has an opportunity to say thePledge of Allegiance to the flag every day,'' EducationCommissioner Harold Raynolds said in an interview Thursday.   Republican George Bush has attempted to make Dukakis' 1977 vetoof a state law requiring teachers to conduct the pledge into acampaign issue in their presidential contest.   Dukakis, in vetoing the bill, cited advisory legal opinions andU.S. Supreme Court precedents that making the pledge mandatorywould be unconstitutional. He says he supports saying the pledgeitself.   Raynolds said Massachusetts schools observe that policy ofencouraging the pledge on a voluntary basis.   ``The law is clear (that) those teachers who do not wish toconduct it, or those students who do not wish to say it, are notcompelled to do so,'' he said. But he added that such exceptionsare ``very, very, very few, one or two perhaps in a school, in mostcases.''   Bush has claimed that Dukakis was simply ``looking for areason'' to refuse to sign the bill.   Dukakis responded this week that he recites the Pledge ofAllegiance himself and would urge children to do so.   His 1977 veto was based largely on an advisory opinion from thestate Supreme Court.   The court said the bill before Dukakis that year, to amend a1935 law requiring teachers to lead the pledge once a week,violated the First Amendment rights of freedom of speech andreligion. It also said the original law was unconstitutional.   The amendment said: ``Each teacher at the commencement of thefirst class of each day in all grades in all public schools shalllead the class in a group recitation of the `Pledge of Allegianceto the Flag.'''   Failure of a teacher over a period of two consecutive weeks ``tosalute the flag and recite said pledge..., or to cause the pupilsunder his charge so to do, shall be punished for every such periodby a fine of not more than $5.''   At Dukakis' request, the state Supreme Court studied theamendment and by a 5-2 vote issued an advisory opinion saying theentire law regarding the pledge violated teachers' First Amendmentrights.   The court cited a 1943 U.S. Supreme Court decision, WestVirginia Board of Education vs. Barnette, which held that requiringa student, under the threat of expulsion, to recite the pledge andsalute the flag violated the student's First Amendment rights. Thestudent, a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses, had objected onreligious grounds.   ``In our view, the rationale of the Barnette opinion applies aswell to teachers as it does to students,'' the state court said.   ``However commendable the Legislature's interest may be inimbuing young people with patriotic feelings, that interest canonly be implemented through a precise and narrowly drawn provisionwhich achieves the basic purpose without compromising FirstAmendment rights,'' the justices said.   Acting on the court's opinion, Dukakis wrote to the Legislaturein 1977, ``My oath of office, as does yours, requires me to upholdthe Constitution of the United States. I cannot sign any bill thatviolates the Constitution, as this bill has been declared to do.''   The Legislature overrode Dukakis' veto, by votes of 201-27 inthe House and 24-7 in the Senate. The bill became law and remainson the books today.   But then-state Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti issued anopinion in 1977 saying that because of the constitutional question,the law ``may not be enforced.''   ``So it has never been enforced, couldn't be enforced,'' currentAttorney General James Shannon said Thursday.   Bush, in political speeches over the past week, has said hedoesn't believe the framers of the Constitution would haveconsidered it a violation of anyone's constitutional rights to berequired to recite the Pledge of Allegiance. ``I would have signedthat bill'' and let the U.S. Supreme Court resolve the issue, hesays on the campaign trail.   But Shannon said, ``The question really was, OK, do you forpolitical purposes make people go through the expense and thetrouble of having to strike down a clearly unconstitutional law, ordo you go with the highest court's decision? He (Dukakis) did theright thing.''   Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard LawSchool, said courts in other states have ruled similarly to theMassachusetts court.   ``The confusion that I think is created about it ... is thatmany assume that if teachers have a right to kind of opt out ofleading the class in the pledge, that therefore the Pledge ofAllegiance will not be somehow an official part of the schoolday,'' Tribe said.   ``But of course that's not what was at stake. It remains anofficial part of the school day. It is just a question of whetherteachers, like students, have a right for reasons of religiousconscience to be excused from taking part in it.''</TEXT></DOC>
