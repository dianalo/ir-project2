(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Playboy Bunnies in cotton-tail costumeswill dip their last bunny dips tonight when the last Playboy Clubin America closes.   The Hilton Inn dropped its Playboy Club franchise to ``create anew image'' for the lounge connected to its hotel. ``It sometimesdiscourages group meeting planners from selecting the Lansinghotel,'' sales director Shelly Ahlers said.   The club, which opened in 1982, was the last holdout in a28-year tradition. Franchises in Des Moines and Omaha closed at theend of April, while Playboy Enterprises Inc. shut down all theclubs it owned in 1986.   Nearly 30 Playboy Clubs sprang up around the United States afterPlayboy publisher Hugh Hefner opened the first in Chicago in 1960.   Every club followed the Hefner formula: waitresses served drinkswhile perched on spike heels and squeezed into figure-hugging,strapless, low-cut satin costumes accessorized with tuxedo collars,cuffs, fluffy white tails and bunny ears.   Playboy bunnies were trained to serve drinks by ``dipping''demurely rather than bending over.   When he closed the Playboy-owned clubs, Hefner said they hadbecome ``passe'' and ``too tame for the times.''   After tonight, anyone interested in patronizing a Playboy Clubwill have to go to the Orient.   The Lansing club had a reunion Thursday of all the Playboybunnies who ever served cocktails there.   Tonight, a reunion is planned for the people who werecard-carrying club members before low attendance forced the ownersto throw away the key cards and let anyone in. ``Business has beenso slow,'' club Manager Jeff Collar said.   On Saturday, club memorabilia will be auctioned for charity.   The closing, announced earlier this month, gave both the cluband hotel a boost as former customers, curiosity seekers andreporters descended to witness the end of an era.   ``The bunnies are getting pretty good at interviews,'' Collarsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
