By midday today, territorial police said no guerrillas of theSouth-West Africa People's Organization had shown up at any of ninecheckpoints established Tuesday by the U.N. force monitoringNamibia's transition to independence.   ``It is not the business of South Africa to interrogate or checkSWAPO cadres. It the business of UNTAG and UNTAG alone,'' guerrillaofficial Kapuka Nauyala said today of the U.N. TransitionAssistance Group.   Sam Nujoma, SWAPO's exiled president, has called on his fightersto withdraw as part of an agreement to get the U.N. independenceplan back on track after heavy fighting last week.   South Africa says about 1,900 guerrillas infiltrated intonorthern Namibia starting April 1, the day a cease-fire was to takehold. U.N. investigators agree the guerrillas violated a peaceaccord requiring they stay in Angolan bases at least until May 15.   Territorial officials said Tuesday the United Nations had agreedthat police supervised by U.N. peacekeepers could interrogateguerrillas who report to the checkpoints about the whereabouts ofother insurgents and possible arms caches.   But a U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, no suchagreement was reached.   Nauyala, SWAPO's chief representative in Zimbabwe, said anyquestioning by security forces would be unacceptable.   ``UNTAG will commit a monumental sin if it allows itself to beco-opted into South Africa's campaign aimed at discrediting andhumiliating SWAPO and its military cadres,'' Nauyala told theZimbabwe Inter-African News Agency.   Black African nations last week denounced the special U.N. envoyto Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, who outraged them by allowing SouthAfrica-led security forces out of bases to fight the guerrillaincursion.   White security force officers and Namibian civilians who supportSWAPO predict few guerrillas will report to the checkpoints. Theycite the deployment of security force personnel at the points, theproximity of military bases, and poor communication betweenguerrilla commanders and their forces.   Police said some guerrillas might try to cross into Angolawithout reporting to checkpoints and others might hide theirweapons, don civilian clothes and try to stay in Namibia.   Police Chief Inspector Derrick Brune said groups of insurgentswere seen today moving south, away from the Angola border.   No major skirmishes have been reported since last weekend. SouthAfrica says 263 guerrillas and 27 security force members werekilled in fighting that erupted April 1. SWAPO says 38 of itsfighters and 54 civilians were killed. Another 15 guerrillas werecaptured.   South Africa has ruled the mineral-rich territory north of itsborder since World War I and in defiance of U.N. demands itwithdraw.   In December, Pretoria agreed to give Namibia independence inexchange for Cuba withdrawing its 50,000 troops from Angola, wherethey supported the Marxist government's forces in a civil waragainst rebels backed by South Africa.   SWAPO has been fighting South African rule since 1966.</TEXT></DOC>
