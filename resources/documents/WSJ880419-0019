Apcar (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK TNM BBK </IN><TEXT>   First City Bancorp. of Texas apparently is on the verge of closing its long-delayed $1.5 billion bailout after frantically rounding up some new investors and coming close to its goal of redeeming 70% of debt.    The beleagured Houston-based banking concern, whose debt tender offer expired yesterday at 5 p.m. EDT, didn't immediately announce the final results of its redemption offer. But officials involved in the transaction say that the tender came sufficiently close to completing the transaction. Final results are expected to be announced early today.    Meanwhile, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York investment bankers, tentatively agreed to raise $100 million of $500 million in fresh capital that is part of the $1.5 billion First City rescue. Drexel's move backstops First City's bailout, which was casting about for additional investors recently after some earlier ones backed out or failed to deliver the funds. &quot;It's one thing to commit the dough and another thing to come up with it,&quot; said a First City insider.    In addition, A. Robert Abboud, the Chicago banker who is leading First City's restructuring, sweetened the offering of new First City preferred stock by slightly increasing the yields. First City may proceed to close the transaction as early as today followed by an announcement of Mr. Abboud's management team possible later in the week.    Over the weekend and yesterday, Mr. Abboud scrambled to find bond holdouts and additional investors. His group offered First City bondholders 35 cents to 45 cents on the dollar for the debt but many holders were balking. They were hoping for an increased bid or, failing that, hoping to wind up in the untendered 30% that would trade at a premium to Mr. Abboud's offer.    First City just about had the tender offer for 70% of its $225.8 million in debt wrapped up and was about to break out the champagne when its previous deadline expired last Thursday. But First City officials said that a group of savings-and-loan associations in the Southeast instructed the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta to withdraw $7 million in bonds it had tendered earlier.    Then, the Sandamp;Ls apparently sold them on the secondary market at a tidy premium and First City officials couldn't find the buyers. What's more, First City officials complained that the broker involved, Prudential-Bache Securities wouldn't tell them.    Those $7 million in bonds would have made up the difference when First City fell short of its 70% goal last Thursday when the tender expired. First City said it had received 66.1% of the bonds as of last Thursday.    Prudential-Bache said it was merely executing an unsoliciated sell order for a customer and declined to elaborate.    Should First City fall short of the 70% goal, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is expected to close First City's insolvent banks and sell them to Mr. Abboud's investor group. In a private meeting with Drexel investors last week, L. William Seidman, the FDIC's chairman, said the FDIC was prepared to use the FDIC's recently-acquired &quot;bridge bank&quot; powers to close banks sometime this year. Under those powers, the FDIC could run the banks or sell them to investors such as Mr. Abboud.    In First City's case, such a closing probably would occur in stages, regulators and bankers say. Insolvent banks would fail first and then be sold to Mr. Abboud, followed eventually by First City's solvent banks that probably would become insolvent as First City's network of banks unraveled. The holding company probably would file for bankrutpcy and its debt holders would be left with practically worthless paper.    There was widespread speculation, which Mr. Abboud strongly denied, that his investment banker, Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. was having trouble finding sufficient investors to recapitalize First City.    When some prospective investors began to shy away from the deal, Mr. Abboud increased the initial yields on two issues of new First City preferred stock to 13 1/2% from 13%, and to 11% from 10%, respectively. </TEXT></DOC>
