In the lawsuit filed Thursday, Moseley said his former wife has``exposed the children to influences which are extremelydetrimental to (their) well-being and best interest.''   No further details of the lawsuit were immediately available.   The children's mother, Bette Lee Roberts, was awarded custody oftheir sons when the couple's divorce became final in April 1988.   Neither Ms. Roberts nor her attorney could be reached forcomment Thursday.   Moseley originally was charged with rape and sexual assault. Hewas acquitted of those charges but was found guilty of the lessercharge of oral sodomy under a 156-year-old Georgia law.   He was released Aug. 30 on appeal, and a judge later overturnedthe conviction. The judge ruled that Georgia's sodomy law cannot beapplied to consenting married adults.   Moseley, a 35-year-old carpenter, has not seen his sons, DarylGene, 4, and Mark Warren, 2, since his imprisonment. He said hewill not fight to deny Ms. Roberts visitation rights.   During his trial, Moseley testified that he believed his wifehad the sexual assault charges filed partly because she wanted tosabotage his plans to seek custody of the boys.</TEXT></DOC>
