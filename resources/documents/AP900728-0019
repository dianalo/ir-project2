Senate Democrats on Friday joined Republicans in calling for atotal abolition of the special interest political action committeesresponsible for raising $45 million of the $180 million spent onSenate campaigns in the 1988 elections.   With the Senate scheduled to vote next week on campaign financereform legislation, the move by Democratic leaders effectivelydenied Republicans a chance to force a vote on PACs and portrayDemocrats as opponents of reform.   For months, Republicans have been calling for abolition of thecommittees, which have tended to bestow an overwhelming majority oftheir largesse in recent campaigns on incumbent congressionalDemocrats.   Also deleted from the Democratic reform package Friday was aplan opposed by virtually all Republicans and many Democrats forthe government to pay 70 percent of a candidate's general electioncampaign costs through a voluntary taxpayer checkoff.   ``They kept talking about PACs and public financing,'' Borensaid of Republicans. ``We hope they will reciprocate by taking inspending limits.''   The Democratic moves were the latest in a flurry of efforts byeach party to portray itself as the conciliating agent of reformand the opposing party as the obstacle to it before the Senatebegins debating the issue Monday.   Republican leaders on Thursday for the first time offered toaccept at least a notion of an aggregate ceiling on how much acandidate can raise, but only for out-of-state contributions inexcess of $250 each.   Senate candidates under the GOP proposal could still raiseunlimited funds from in-state voters and through direct-mailcampaigns to out-of-state donors of less than $250.   The GOP, which a much more advanced computerized direct-mailapparatus than Democrats, contend a ceiling on total spending wouldprevent challengers from buying the TV ads most of them need tomatch an incumbent's name recognition.   Because of constitutional concerns that an outright ban on PACsmight be ruled a violation of First Amendment rights of freespeech, both parties have a fallback position to reduce how mucheach PAC could contribute to a single candidate.   The current maximum allowable contribution a candidate canreceive from any one PAC is $5,000 each for primary, runoff andgeneral elections. The fallback provision would cut that amount to$1,000.   Boren and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, saidDemocrats remain united on insisting that any bill have an absoluteceiling on total aggregate spending.   Their proposal currently calls for ceilings of $1 million to$5.5 million for each of the primary, runoff and general elections,based on the size of each state's voting age population. Democrats,however, have said they are willing to raise the lids if it wouldpick up Republican votes.   House Democratic leaders, meanwhile, were still undecided onwhether to bring up rival campaign finance measures for a vote nextweek before recessing for an August vacation.   Two Democratic bills would place a spending ceiling of $550,000on House races. One would limit PAC contributions to half thatamount, or $275,000, with no public financing. The other wouldlimit PACs to $240,000 with $100,000 of public financing.   Like their Senate counterparts, House Republicans are opposingany campaign ceilings. They also would limit individual PACcontributions to a candidate to $1,000 for each election.</TEXT></DOC>
