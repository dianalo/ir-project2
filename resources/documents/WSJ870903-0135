Live coverage of the key contests, highlights of the rest, from Flushing Meadow-Corona Park, N.Y.    Sunday, Sept. 6, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on Cinemax (repeated Sept. 11, 17, 22, 26 and 30): &quot;A Session with Chet Atkins, Certified Guitar Player.&quot; Rock, country and pop stars join Atkins in this &quot;Cinemax Sessions&quot; music special taped in Nashville. After 116 albums, eight Grammys and induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame, Atkins had better be certified by now.    Wednesday, Sept. 9, 4-5 p.m. EDT, on ABC: &quot;Just a Regular Kid: An AIDS Story.&quot; The new season of &quot;ABC Afterschool Specials&quot; begins with this didactic tale of a high school student who contracts AIDS through a contaminated blood transfusion. The story turns itself inside out trying to instruct young viewers that, first, AIDS can strike perfectly &quot;normal&quot; teens like themselves; and, second, that it is unreasonable to be afraid of the disease, because it is not easily caught.    Thursday, Sept. 10, 8:30-11 p.m. EDT, on Aandamp;E (repeated Sept. 11 at 12:30 a.m. and Sept. 13 at 2 p.m.): &quot;The Theban Plays: Oedipus the King.&quot; The speeches are in contemporary English, but the staging and filming of this BBC production try to preserve the atmosphere of the ancient original. Michael Pennington stars as Oedipus, Claire Bloom as Jocasta and Sir John Gielgud as Teiresias.    Friday, Sept. 11, 9 p.m.-conclusion EDT, on MTV: Video Music Awards. If you like your drama more contemporary, join the stars, comets and asteroids of the pop music industry for this offbeat awards ceremony. Included will be a new category, &quot;Best New Video From a Film.&quot; Meaning, in other words, they're giving a prize for best movie promotional trailer.    Sundays, Sept. 13-Nov. 22, 2 p.m.-various concluding times, on PBS (PBS air dates and times vary, so check local listings): &quot;The Compleat Gilbert and Sullivan.&quot; Before the repeats begin in October, this Mobil-funded series presents three new TV versions of &quot;Iolanthe,&quot; &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; and &quot;Princess Ida.&quot;    Sunday Sept. 13, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on ABC: &quot;Bluffing It.&quot; As part of its efforts to combat illiteracy -- Project Literacy U.S. (PLUS), co-sponsored with PBS-Capital Cities/ABC presents this well-meaning film about a closet illiterate who must face up to the fact that he can't go on fooling the world. Dennis Weaver stars.    Sunday, Sept. 13, 9 p.m. EDT, on the Discovery Channel (repeated during the following week, check cable listings): &quot;On the Brink: An AIDS Chronicle.&quot; Like all the other documentaries about AIDS that have come out in recent months, this one announces that it dispenses with &quot;rampant fiction&quot; in favor of the facts, and that it wants to overcome fear and prejudice and end the disease. Who can argue?    Monday, Sept. 14, 8-10 p.m. EDT, on Aandamp;E (repeated Sept. 14 at midnight and Sept. 27 at noon): &quot;Double Helix.&quot; Somewhere, let's hope there are a Watson and Crick working together on a cure for AIDS. Meanwhile, let me recommend this BBC/Aandamp;E co-production starring Jeff Goldblum as the raffish Watson, and Tim Pigott-Smith as the rational Crick. Among other attractions, the film uses various locations at Cambridge University, including the first footage ever shot of the inside of the Great Hall of Peterhouse College.    Tuesday, Sept. 15, all day and every weekday thereafter until conclusion, on CNN: The Senate confirmation hearings on the nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. The first witness to testify before the Judiciary Committee will be Judge Bork himself. It promises to be quite a revealing battle, with Judge Bork's controversial positions on such issues as abortion on the one hand, and the Democratic opposition led by Sen. Joe Biden on the other.    Tuesday, Sept. 15, various times (check local listings), on stations served by Orbis Communications: &quot;National AIDS Awareness Test.&quot; Metropolitan Life has underwritten this two-hour special program, which will appear on many Fox and Group W stations. Naturally, the show intends to emphasize facts over fiction, and will quiz viewers about the subject. Of course, viewers willing to cooperate with such a test are not viewers most in need of information. And of course, such a test format implies that the questions and answers are clearer than they really are. But I still prefer these straightforwardly didactic shows to those that try to teach through &quot;drama.&quot;    Wednesday, Sept. 16, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS (Thursday, Sept. 17 on WNET/Thirteen): &quot;I Would Be Called John: Pope John XXIII.&quot; As his successor, Pope John Paul II, arrives in America, it might be interesting to see this one-man performance by Charles Durning, depicting John XXIII as an unqualified hero. </TEXT></DOC>
