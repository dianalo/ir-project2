Revenue eased slightly to $1.04 billion from $1.05 billion.    Norfolk Southern said coal traffic in the first half was &quot;well below&quot; that of a year earlier, but shipments of agricultural, paper and chemical products improved. The company said it expects coal traffic levels to improve later this year, as utilities stockpile to prepare for a possible coal miners strike in 1988.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Norfolk Southern shares closed at $35.375, up 62.5 cents, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose sharply.    For the first half, Norfolk Southern earnings were flat at $247.2 million, or $1.30 a share, compared with $246.7 million, or $1.30 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 2% to $2.02 billion from $2.06 billion.    The latest first-half earnings include an after-tax gain of $32.8 million from the sale in the first quarter of 2.3 million common shares of Piedmont Aviation Inc., for which the company made an unsuccessful bid.    At a meeting with securities analysts yesterday in New York, Norfolk Southern also said it is offering a voluntary early-retirement and severance program to certain nonunion employees.    The company said about 1,100, or 20%, of its nonunion employees are eligible for the programs. Norfolk Southern said the move reflects &quot;declining rail business and forecasts that are less than promising.&quot;    Arnold McKinnon, chairman and president of Norfolk Southern, told analysts that he expects at least 600 employees to accept the offer. He declined to predict annual savings.    The move comes as the latest step in the cost-cutting trend among railroads in their efforts to compete with the trucking industry. The transportation industry was deregulated in 1980. </TEXT></DOC>
