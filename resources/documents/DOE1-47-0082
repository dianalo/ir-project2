During the 1990's this position is likelyto reverse for a variety of reasons. Apart form political arguments,energy efficient processes can be equal or lower in capital cost dueto less or smaller machinery needs. To synthesise a design which is bothelegant and also optimised with regard to energy utilisation, ExergyAnalysis (or loss analysis) has, they believe, a major role to play.This paper gives a brief introduction to the underlying thermodynamicprinciples, which an engineer must appreciate if he is to make use ofloss analysis as a tool. Some different methods of applying exergy analysisare outlined. This is followed by a more detailed discussion of how aNGL recovery process has been developed by applying some basic principlesof exergy efficient design.</TEXT></DOC>
