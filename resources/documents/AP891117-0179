(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   First-grader Megan Lambert wanted to go toher school Friday, even though it was closed and she had nightmaresabout the cafeteria wall that was toppled by a tornado and killedseven of her schoolmates.   ``Something like this happens, your mind can never get off it,''said the 7-year-old who escaped injury in Thursday's storm at EastColdenham Elementary School.   Anne Crowley, will attend service Sunday. 7 p.m.   ``Some of my friends are dead and some more may get dead,''Megan said.   More than 100 first-, second- and third-graders were eating whena tornado slammed into the 30-foot concrete-and-glass wall, killingseven children and injuring 18 others. Thirteen remainedhospitalized Friday, three in critical condition.   The National Weather Service had posted a tornado watch forlarge parts of the East Coast from Maryland to New England,including the Newburgh area and metropolitan New York, as stormsalong a rapidly moving cold front caused tornadoes, high winds andheavy rain from the Southeast to New England.   The two-day toll from the storms was at least 29 dead andhundreds injured, including 17 dead and 1,000 homeless inHuntsville, Ala., which was struck by a large twister Wednesdayevening.   President Bush issued a disaster declaration Friday forHuntsville, making the city eligible for federal relief programs,said Gov. Guy Hunt's press secretary, Terry Abbott.   Hunt said he believed damage exceeded $100 million.   Another tornado Thursday knocked over trees and ripped roofs offhouses in West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle, the National WeatherService confirmed. And a tornado ripped the roof off an officebuilding in King of Prussia, Pa., outside Philadelphia.   Storms also caused flooding in Washington, D.C., blew windowsout of skyscrapers in Philadelphia, destroyed a house inPiscataway, N.J., and blew the roof off a shopping mall in Quebec.   At Newburgh, National Weather Service meteorologist RolandLoffredo said wind blew about 100 mph near the school duringThursday's storm, but the strongest wind was at a higher altitudeand the school did not bear the full brunt of the storm.   ``It was very fortunate actually, in spite of the tragedy itcould have been worse,'' said Loffredo, who said his survey ofdamage and witness accounts led him to believe a strong tornadocaused the damage at the school.   The 27-year-old school was last inspected in 1984, said JamesCoonan, superintendent of the Valley Central School District.   Rotting wood was found around some windows then and wasreplaced, he said. ``It was as strong as it could be,'' Coonan said.   Coonan called off classes Friday for the 4,000 children in theseven-school system.   The district's high school and middle school will be open allweekend ``for those who need emotional support,'' Coonan said.Counselors will be available all weekend at Berea ElementarySchool, two miles from the damaged school, he said, and they willbe stationed at all district schools when they reopen.   A memorial service to be held Sunday night in the high schoolauditorium will be attended by Gov. Mario Cuomo, said hisspokeswoman, Anne Crowley.   Representatives of Cuomo also will attend a meeting calledSaturday by U.S. Rep. Hamilton Fish to discuss aid for the schooldistrict and families of the victims, Cuomo spokesman Gary Fryersaid.   A 9-year-old girl was in critical condition Friday at AlbanyMedical Center Hospital, a spokesperson said. A 7-year-old boy anda 7-year-old girl were in critical condition at Westchester CountyMedical Center in Valhalla, and a 6-year-old girl was listed asserious, a spokesperson said.   Nine other children remained in two area hospitals, most insatisfactory condition. The five others injured were treated andreleased.   East Coldenham will reopen for classes Tuesday, but Coonan urgedparents to take their children to the school on Monday to reassurethem that the building is safe.   Contractors in the area offered to rebuild the cafeteria wallfor free, but Coonan wouldn't say if he had accepted any offers.   Mar Routson took her two daughters to the boarded-up schoolFriday even though her daughter attends first grade at anotherschool.   ``I wanted to show them the school is OK,'' she said.   ``This is a small community. We all feel this. These are ourchildren, not your children who were hurt,'' Routson said.   Megan Lambert had trouble sleeping Thursday night because shekept thinking of her best friend, Kayla McDowell, who was inserious condition Friday, according to her mother, Beth Lambert.   Brian Jablonski, 13, said his sister, a fourth grader at theschool, was shaken up.   ``She seemed to be able to sleep through anything but alwayswoke up when the wind blew,'' he said.   Sean Benson, a fourth grader, said he was in music class whenthe wall collapsed.   ``Everybody started screaming down the hall,'' the 10-year-oldsaid. ``We laughed at that because we thought they were just scaredbecause of the storm.   ``Then a teacher came in and she was crying.''</TEXT></DOC>
