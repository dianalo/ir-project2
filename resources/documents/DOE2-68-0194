Prior to the 1980s,these systems were designed individually by engineers who had to designboth the cogeneration system and its interface with the end users. Eachof the various components was specified individually and the system was&quot;built-up&quot; at the site. With the passage of PURPA, various entrepreneurssought to satisfy the perceived demand for cogeneration systems. Oneproblem that was soon encountered was that, while there were numerousopportunities to apply cogeneration in smaller facilities, the requiredinvestments often were prohibitively high. For systems of less than afew hundred kilowatts, the fixed project costs were not justified bythe potential reduction in operating costs. The lack of economic viabilitywas true despite the fact that these smaller energy users usually paymore per unit of energy.</TEXT></DOC>
