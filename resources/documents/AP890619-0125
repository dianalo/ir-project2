(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Headlines about several unsolved murders ineastern Virginia have faded, but the victims' families have notforgotten and they're pressing law enforcement agencies to keepinvestigating.   ``You want to know and you don't want to know,'' said RichardCall, whose son, Keith, disappeared on a date. ``There's still a rayof hope, very slight, I guess.''   On Tuesday, the families will press the State Crime Commissionfor a multijurisdictional police task force to investigate thecrimes.   ``We're hoping maybe somebody else out there won't end up likeour family members,'' said Robert E. Fanton, father-in-law of BrianC. Pettinger, whose bound body was found in the James River inFebruary 1988.   It's been nearly three years since Cathleen Thomas, a youngstockbroker, and Rebecca Dowski, a college student, were foundstrangled with their throats cut in Ms. Thomas' car along theColonial Parkway.   About two years ago, David Knobling, 20, and Robin Edwards, 14,were found shot to death near the Ragged Island Wildlife Refugewhere they had gone on a date.   In April 1888, Christopher Newport College students CassandraHailey and Keith Call disappeared on their first date. The elderCall found their abandoned car along the Colonial Parkway the nextmorning.   Other cases the parents are concerned about include the January1988 slaying of Dawn Hill at an Eastern Shore service station, theSeptember 1988 shooting death of Milton Ames while he walked inExmore and the fatal stabbing of Laurie Ann Powell, who was foundfloating in the James River in April 1988.   The relatives do not think all the cases are connected, but theydo think the police should be doing more.   ``We had four jurisdictions that were involved. They want to bethe one that has the so-called glory of solving the case,'' saidKathy Knobling, David Knobling's stepmother. ``Nobody wants to sharethe information.''   Mrs. Knobling and other relatives of 10 missing or murderedpeople formed Family and Friends Against Crime Today to callattention to unsolved crimes. She said the membership of the groupand the number of victims represented fluctuates.   The FBI is investigating the Thomas-Dowski murders and theCall-Hailey disappearances because they occurred on federal parkproperty.   ``We don't have information that those cases are related otherthan the fact that they both occurred in fairly close proximity,''said Joe Wolfinger, special agent with the FBI's Norfolk office.   He said law enforcement agencies in the area already arecooperating but that he would not object to a task force if it wouldhelp solve the crimes.   ``We are meeting and discussing and have met with and discussedthe facts to all these cases with the appropriate law enforcementoffices,'' he said.   The other slayings are being investigated by state and localpolice.   ``They are trying, but they've got robberies, they've got rapes,they've got other cases that have clues coming in,'' Mrs. Knoblingsaid. ``Our cases get put on the back burner.''   She said the families have obtained 23,000 signatures onpetitions seeking a regional police task force. They are takingtheir cases to the crime commission because it advises the governorand state legislature on crime issues.   Bob Colvin, the commission's executive director, said he wasunaware of the commission ever being asked to help set up a regionaltask force.   ``I'm not sure what we can do,'' he said.   While the victims' families wait for arrests, they have becomefriends, Mrs. Knobling said. They have cookouts and sometimes gettogether just to talk about their grief and their efforts to makesure the murders are not forgotten.   ``These murders are unsolved. You've got a murderer or two orthree walking around out there. They could do it again,'' she said.``If we can solve one murder, we will feel like we will haveaccomplished what we set out to do.''</TEXT></DOC>
