The rules also would require that certified and trained workers conduct the inspections, prepare plans for schools to manage their asbestos problems and perform repairs or removals. The agency estimated that implementation of the proposal, which is expected to take effect in October, will cost about $3.2 billion over the next 30 years.    The proposal was mandated by a law enacted late last year. It would replace a less-restrictive program that called for schools to inspect for dangerous asbestos materials and to notify the public of the results. EPA officials said only about 70% of schools complied with that requirement and some failed to fix dangerous asbestos that had been discovered.    One goal of the rules is to prevent overreaction about asbestos and shoddy removal practices that can increase risks from asbestos, according to EPA officials. The proposal makes clear that schools may leave asbestos materials in buildings unless they become &quot;friable,&quot; meaning flaky and emitting tiny fibers that can cause cancer and other diseases of the lungs and other tissues.    In a 1984 study, the EPA estimated that about 35,000 school buildings contained friable asbestos, and that those schools were occupied by 15 million students and 1.3 million employees. </TEXT></DOC>
