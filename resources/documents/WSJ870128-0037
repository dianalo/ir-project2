The move is part of a rapid consolidation in the paper and forest products industry and would extend Stone Container's lead as the nation's biggest maker of corrugated containers. The acquisition, which is subject to approval by Southwest Forest shareholders, would give Stone Container 13% of the industry's production of linerboard, the material used to make boxes.    Phoenix, Ariz.-based Southwest Forest, which had 1986 sales of $631.5 million, has widely been considered to be a likely acquisition target of the big paper product companies.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Southwest Forest closed at $31.125, up $7.50. It was the Big Board's third most active stock, with volume of 2,705,700 shares. Stone Container closed at $74.25, up $2.    As part of the definitive accord signed yesterday, Southwest Forest agreed to redeem for 25 cents each anti-takeover right it gave shareholders in 1984. &quot;Our transaction is totally a friendly one,&quot; said Arnold F. Brookstone, Stone Container senior vice president and chief financial officer.    Last summer, Stone Container said it was too busy digesting its $426 million purchase of Champion International Corp.'s packaging business to make another major acquisition through 1987. &quot;We didn't anticipate this happening quite as early as it did,&quot; Mr. Brookstone said. He wouldn't elaborate on the circumstances of the Southwest Forest acquisition, but added that Stone Container has no plans for any more major acquisitions.    Stone Container said it plans to merge the operations of Southwest Forest with its own plants and eliminate the post of William A. Franke, Southwest Forest chairman and chief executive officer.    Mr. Franke, 49 years old, said he won't remain as an executive after the acquisition. &quot;I frankly think the combined companies would be better served by having one person at the top. I didn't want to encumber the process,&quot; he said. He added that he doesn't have any specific plans.    Southwest Forest's mills in Snowflake, Ariz., and Panama City, Fla., have an annual combined production capacity of 960,000 tons of paper products, which would increase Stone Container's capacity by 28%. Southwest Forest also operates 19 plants making corrugated containers, several plywood and veneer plants and two short-line railroads and has about 334,000 acres of timberland in the South, among other things.    Stone Container said it would consider selling Southwest Forest operations that don't fit with its packaging businesses. Mark Kurland, a paper industry analyst for Mabon, Nugent andamp; Co., said Stone Container could fetch about $300 million for Southwest Forest's newsprint operation.    In addition to the offer for Southwest Forest's 13.7 million fully diluted common shares, Stone Container said it would assume Southwest Forest's obligations, which include about $264 million in long-term debt.    Mr. Kurland said Stone Container's $32.25-a-share bid is a fair offer. Stone Container is offering a big premium over the price Southwest Forest was trading at before the bid was announced, but it would have to pay twice as much to build the same production capacity, Mr. Kurland said.    The consolidation in the paper industry is being spurred by the high cost of building new mills as well as strong demand for U.S.-made paper products. By buying out competitors, the surviving companies aren't adding the capacity that would tend to push down prices from their high levels. Demand has been strong because the weakening dollar is reducing foreign competition.    Stone Container said it will finance the acquisition, which it expects to complete by early April, with a new $1.1 billion credit facility. The financing is primarily a 7 1/2-year term loan, which will also be used to refinance bank credits, it said.    Among the beneficiaries of Southwest Forest's rising stock price is Hearst Corp., the New York-based publishing concern. Hearst is Southwest Forest's largest shareholder with a stake of 13%, or about 1.6 million shares.    Mr. Franke, chairman of Southwest Forest, said in an interview that his discussions with Roger W. Stone, chairman of Stone Container, began &quot;in the latter part of last year.&quot; Mr. Franke said he had known Mr. Stone for many years and that they served as directors of a paper industry trade group.    Southwest Forest could have survived as an independent company, Mr. Franke contended. However, he acknowledged the paper industry's &quot;considerable consolidation,&quot; saying it refects &quot;the need to have considerable mass to remain competitive in a cyclical, capital-intensive business.&quot;    In 1984, Southwest Forest directors approved a $24-a-share leveraged buyout proposal from a management group that included Mr. Franke. However, the group dropped its bid because of changes in markets for the company's products and rising interest rates, Mr. Franke said. Later, Southwest Forest rebuffed a $24-a-share offer from Jefferson Smurfit Corp., which is controlled by a paper company in Ireland. Last year, Southwest Forest also repelled a threatened proxy fight by an Oklahoma investor group.    ---   Also contributing to this article was David B. Hilder. </TEXT></DOC>
