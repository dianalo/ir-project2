Shultz, urged theSoviet Union to broaden its recently proclaimed policy of allowingJews who emigrate to choose their new homeland.   Morris B. Abram, chairman of the National Conference on SovietJewry, said Moscow should allow more Jews to apply for exit permitsto any country of their choice, rather than just Israel. A Kremlinofficial said Thursday that ``It's up to them where they go.''   Most Soviet Jews permitted to emigrate are given exit permitsfor Israel, but about 90 percent go to the United States once theyreach Vienna, the transit point to Tel Aviv.   Concerned about the loss of immigrants, the Israeli Cabinet hasordered a change in procedures. Soviet Jews granted exit permitswould receive their Israeli visas in Romania and go on to Israel.From there it would be difficult to get to the United Statesbecause they would no longer have refugee status.   Abram said the Israeli government ``has a right to make thatdecision'' and that it would be ``a travesty'' to permit immigrantsfrom the Soviet Union to retain refugee status once they reachedIsrael.   ``It would be a declaration that a Jew, welcomed as he is inIsrael, is a refugee in his homeland,'' Abram said. ``That would bea terrible construction of the meaning and purpose of the Jewishstate.''   Soviet Jews who go to Israel are considered immigrants underU.S. law. As a result, it is much more difficult for them to gainadmission to the United States than as refugees in Vienna.   The situation has caused some strains between American Jews andIsrael as well as disputes within the American Jewish community.   The solution, Abram said, lies in the Soviet government'sassertion that it does not care where emigrants chose to live. Hecited a statement on Thursday by Deputy Foreign Minister VladimirPetrovsky in Moscow that ``we just allow all these people to leavethe country. It's up to them where they go.''   Abram said ``as long as that is the position of the Sovietgovernment it is quite possible for freedom of choice to beexercised in the Soviet Union.''   In the past year, the Soviet Union has increased Jewishemigration to the West to a rate of more than 1,000 a month,compared to 1,000 a year in the early 1980s.   According to statistics compiled by The National Conference onSoviet Jewry, 60 to 90 Jews a month are permitted to leave directlyfor the United States. Abram said 6,000 non-Jews were allowed to golast year.   ``So the idea that it is Soviet policy to prevent people fromleaving directly on American visas doesn't seem to be the case,''Abram said. ``In this case, it seems to be that what they say iswhat they have been doing. Let's hope they continue.''   Abram said Shultz supports the principle of freedom of choice.Otherwise, he and State Department spokesman Charles E. Redmandeclined to elaborate on Shultz's position.</TEXT></DOC>
