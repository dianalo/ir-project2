RJR's credit ratings had been slashed in late 1988, whenthe company agreed to be taken private in a leveragedbuy-out. Since then, RJR's volatile debt securities have beenbellwether issues in the $200 billion market for junk bonds.In the past 18 months, RJR has repeatedly taken steps toupgrade its balance sheet by reducing its debt outstandingand issuing more stock.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. boosted its creditratings for RJR's senior debt to triple-B-minus, the lowestinvestment-grade rating, from double-B-plus. Moody'sInvestors Service Inc. upgraded its rating on RJR's seniordebt to Baa-3 from Ba-1. Both agencies also boosted theirratings on RJR's subordinated debt, to double-B-plus for Sandamp;Pand Ba-2 for Moody's.   &quot;This is great news,&quot; said RJR's chief financial officer,Karl von der Heyden, who joined the company in early 1989.&quot;I've always looked at my primary mission as getting thecompany back to investment grade,&quot; he said.   Both rating agencies cited RJR's recent issuance of $1.7billion of common stock in exchange for 11 1/2% convertiblepreferred stock, and the offering of $2.1 billion of 8.32%preferred equity redeemable cumulative stock, or Percs.Proceeds from the Percs offering are being used to reducedebt.   When RJR was originally taken private in February 1989, ithad planned to reduce its debt quite slowly. Confidentialprojections shared with bank lenders showed that the companyhad expected its debt to total $25.4 billion at the end of1991-nearly double the company's current level.   RJR switched course in July 1990, when the company startedpaying down debt faster with a $1.7 billion equity infusionfrom limited partnerships controlled by the majorshareholder, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. The tobacco andfood company followed with a major equity offering in early1991, then with the latest Percs issue.   &quot;We didn't have a master plan&quot; to reduce debt quickly,RJR's Mr. von der Heyden said. &quot;As we went from onetransaction to the next, the logic of the next step developedin a very compelling way. As is often the case withsuccessful programs, it looks more cohesive now than it wasat the time.&quot;   By achieving an investment-grade rating, RJR increases itsflexibility to make acquisitions or retire some of itsremaining junk-bond issues ahead of schedule, said MorganStanley andamp; Co. analyst Kurt Feuerman. He observed that RJR's17 3/8% junk bonds can be retired at face value in 1993,while the 15% junk bonds can be retired at about face valuein 1994. Mr. von der Heyden said both of these bond issuesare &quot;candidates for further work.&quot;   Before the 1989 buy-out, RJR carried a single-A creditrating on most of its debt. RJR may eventually return to thatlevel, Mr. von der Heyden said, but is likely to move moreslowly than it has to date in upgrading its balance sheet.   Yesterday, RJR said holders of 94.5% of its 11 1/2%convertible preferred stock had tendered their shares in thecompany's latest exchange offer. That leaves about $100million face value of the 11 1/2% preferred outstanding. RJRofficials said the remaining preferred is likely to stayoutstanding for two years, then be converted into common.</TEXT></DOC>
