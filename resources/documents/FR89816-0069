In accordance with section 25(d), the ScientificAdvisory Panel is to have an opportunity to comment on the health and environmentalimpact of such actions.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Charter</ITAG>A Charter for the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel has been issued in accordancewith the requirements of section 9(c) of the Federal Advisory CommitteeAct, Public Law 92-463, 86 Stat. (5 U.S.C. App I). The qualifications asprovided by the Charter follow.A. Qualifications of MembersMembers are scientists who have sufficient professional qualifications,including training and experience, to be capable of providing expert commentsas to the impact on health and the environment of regulatory actions undersections 6(b) and 25(a) of FIFRA. No person shall be ineligible to serveon the Panel by reason of his membership on any other advisory committeeto a Federal department or agency or his employment by a Federal departmentor agency (except the Environmental Protection Agency). The Administratorappoints individuals to serve on the Panel for staggered terms of 4 years.Panel members are subject to the provisions of 40 CFR Part 3, Subpart F_Standardsof Conduct for Special Government Employees, which include rules regardingconflicts-of-interest. An officer and/or employee of an organization producing,selling, or distributing pesticides and any other person having a substantialfinancial interest (as determined by the Administrator) in such an organization,as well as an officer or employee of an organization representing pesticideusers shall be excluded from consideration as a nominee for membershipon the Panel. Each nominee selected by the Administrator shall be required,before being formally appointed, to submit a Confidential Statement ofEmployment and Financial Interests, which shall fully disclose the nominee'ssources of research support, if any.In accordance with section 25(d) of FIFRA, the Administrator shall requireall nominees to the Panel to furnish information concerning their professionalqualifications, including information on their educational background,employment history, and scientific publications. Section 25(d) of FIFRArequires the Administrator to issue for publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> the name, address, and professional affiliationsof each nominee.B. Applicability of Existing RegulationsWith respect to the requirement of section 25(d) that the Administratorpromulgate regulations regarding conflicts of interest, the Charter providesthat EPA's existing regulations applicable to special government employees,which include advisory committee members, will apply to the members ofthe Scientific Advisory Panel. These regulations appear at 40 CFR Part3, Subpart F. In addition, the Charter provides for open meetings withopportunities for public participation.C. Process of Obtaining NomineesIn accordance with the provisions of section 25(d), EPA, in June 1989,requested the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National ScienceFoundation (NSF) to nominate scientists to fill one vacancy occurring onthe SAP.
