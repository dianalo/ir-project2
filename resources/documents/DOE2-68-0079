This is done by making the sails very large using lightfabrics with aluminum or bamboo frames forming a square face, supportedby light strong ropes, by arranging the sails on a single file closeto one after the other at erect posture free to clip to the right orto the left, forming a long procession line transverse to the wind whichis in close loop with another long procession line parallel to it butmoving to the opposite direction, to produce a very large windmill withoutthe need of additional set up units of windmills; by carrying the largesails high about the ground for better wind-contact thru a two levelAerial Cable Railway by means of a deep-groove roller wheel attachedto the top end and to the bottom end of each sail-mast; by separatingthe two parallel lines of sails at least 100 feet apart for better wind-contactthru the use of set of three Terminal Gear Wheels at a Half-Hexagonalformation that hold the end loops of the Power Cable Chain being tuggedby each sail; by making the windmill work during strong winds and storingthe energy in compressed air tunnels, elevated water.</TEXT></DOC>
