In a separate development, the government-owned telephonecompany Entel, which also is to be sold, was valued at around $1.9billion.   Eighty-five percent of Aerolineas Argentinas will be offered for$529 million, of which at least $220 million must be paid in cash.The rest could come from debt-equity swaps, the financial daily ElCronista Comercial reported. The newspaper cited government datadisclosed over the weekend.   The airline currently owes $741 million to foreign banks andfinancial institutions, plus $127 million in interest that wasoverdue last Dec. 31.   Bids are to be opened April 30 and the winner announced in lateJune.   Of the remaining 15 percent of the airline, the government wouldkeep 5 percent, leaving 10 percent to be purchased by employees.   Entel Director Maria Julia Alsogaray recently told Congress thata value of slightly more than $1 billion has been put on the 60percent of the telephone company that is for sale.   A minimum $214 million must be paid in cash for Entel, and theremainder could be covered by debt-equity swaps, according toanother financial daily, Ambito Comercial.   The Public Works Ministry said last month that companies thathave expressed interest in Entel include Midland Bank PLC ofBritain, Societa Finanziaria Telefonica of Italy, and Nynex Corp.,the phone company covering New York state and New England.   The winner of the bid is scheduled to be announced in late June,with the sale expected to be completed in early October.   Some details of both privatizations were still unclear,including how much, if anything, the buyers would be required toinvest and whether there would be restrictions, such as a ban onimmediate resale or a limitation on foreign ownership.   The Peronist Party government of President Carlos Menem haspledged to sell government companies to attract foreign investmentand technology, and to reduce operating losses. For decades,Argentina has printed currency to cover the losses, fuelinginflation.   The proposed sales are opposed by labor unions and nationalistswho maintain the government should own the airline, railroad,electricity and other companies, and by political groups that claimthe government is selling them for too little money.   Leopoldo Moreau, leader of the opposition Civic Radical Union,called the proposed sale of Entel ``a rock-bottom price for one ofthe few state-owned companies that can attract genuine investment.''   The Radical government of Raul Alfonsin, in power from December1983 through last July, tried to sell Aerolineas Argentinas andEntel in late 1988, and was blocked by Congress, which wasdominated by the Peronist Party then as it is now.   Under Alfonsin, 40 percent of the airline would have been soldto Scandanavian Airlines System for $204 million, and 40 percent ofEntel would have been sold to Spain's telephone company,Telefonica, for a reported $1 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
