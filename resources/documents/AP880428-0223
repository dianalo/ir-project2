After a nearly four-hour session that ended early Friday, the 13ministers said they would resume their closed-door deliberationsFriday evening.   Rilwanu Lukman, the Nigerian president of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, said the ministers had discussed theexport-cutting plan ``in general terms, but nothing specific wasdecided.''   The proposed reductions, in combination with cuts by sixnon-OPEC oil exporting countries, are designed to push up oilprices and codify a new spirit of cooperation among oil producers.   The six independent producers on Wednesday said they would cutoil exports by 5 percent for two months if the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries did likewise.   OPEC, however, is divided over how to respond to the offer,which is the first such proposal from rival producers since the oilcartel was formed in 1960.   Oil prices on the open market fell Thursday. Brent crude fromthe North Sea dropped as low as $16.90 a barrel before closing at$17.20 in London, down 30 cents from Wednesday.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, fell 29 cents toclose at $17.98 a barrel. The contract lost 33 cents on Wednesday.   Iran strongly supports the non-OPEC proposal, both as a way ofstrengthening the oil market and as a step toward closer ties withnon-OPEC producers.   ``Any measures and means that can lead to this would besupported by us,'' the Iranian oil minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh,told reporters on his arrival from Tehran.   Other OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia, take a more cautiousview. They want to encourage outside producers to restrain theiroil output, but they see little merit in the terms of the proposalunder consideration in Vienna.   Saudi King Fahd, meanwhile, reiterated his view that OPEC canget prices up simply by sticking to its existing agreement onproduction restraints. He did not comment directly on the non-OPECoffer.   ``I believe prices will go up if we adhere to the output ceilingand convince non-OPEC producers of the feasibility of limitingtheir production,'' he was quoted as saying in an interviewpublished Thursday by a Kuwaiti newspaper.   Officials from the non-OPEC countries were not attendingThursday's cartel meeting, so there was to be no direct negotiatingbetween the two groups.   The offer from the non-OPEC producers _ Mexico, Egypt, China,Oman, Malaysia and Angola _ states that they will cut their exportsby 5 percent from the average level over the past six months. Theysaid this amounted to about 200,000 barrels a day.   The cuts would be for May and June only.   A 5 percent cut by OPEC from its current level of exports wouldamount to about 700,000 barrels a day. Together with the 200,000barrels to be cut by the outsider producers, this could have asignificant impact on the market, analysts said.   But it appeared increasingly clear that OPEC would not cut by asmuch as proposed, sources in several delegations said, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   The cartel easily could argue that a much smaller reductionwould fulfill the terms of the outsiders' proposal, which says onlythat a 5 percent cut by non-OPEC is conditioned on ``a similarproportional response by OPEC.''   If OPEC based its 5 percent cut on an average level of exportsover the past six months _ as the non-OPEC countries had done _then OPEC would have to cut only about 200,000 barrels a day fromits actual present rate of exports. This is because OPEC's exportswere substantially higher in the latter part of 1987.   A cut of 200,000 barrels a day by both groups would have littleor no impact on the balance between oil supply and demand, saidBahman Karbassioun, a Vienna-based oil consultant and a former OPECstaffer.   ``It would have only a symbolic impact,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
