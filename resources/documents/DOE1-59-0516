A group of 137 female patients with suspected pelvic cysticlesions were studied by computerized tomography (CT). Histologically,22 patients were proved to have ovarian cystadenocarcinoma and 115 patientsa benign cystic mass, i.e. cystadenoma, lutein cyst, endometrial cyst,retentional cyst and paraovarian cyst. A scoring system was made to obtainhigher accuracy in CT evaluation of ovarian cystic lesions. It includesseven factors, (1) volume, (2) solid component protruding from the wall,(3) thickness of the wall, (4) focal thickening of the wall, (5) loculation,(6) attenuation number of the tumor and (7) nonhomogenousess of the tumor.Using this scoring system, a correct differential diagnosis was madein all cases except 7, 4 uterine fibroids with remarkable degenaration,a large endometrial cyst with a high attenuation number, a dermoid cystwith an irregular pattern and a mucinous cystadenoma with benign solidcomponent. The accuracy of diagnosis was 100 % in malignant masses and93.9 % in benign masses. This scoring system was shown to have clinicalsignificance for the differential diagnosis of a pelvic cystic lesions.</TEXT></DOC>
