The gun-control victory startled even its proponents andcast doubt on the future of the overall anti-crime package.Republicans immediately threatened to filibuster theDemocratic-sponsored omnibus legislation. Bush administrationlobbyists predicted a veto if the package made it to theWhite House with the prohibition on military-style &quot;assault&quot;weapons.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There's definitely a possibility of a filibuster,&quot; saidan aide to Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), who led theunsuccessful attack on the gun-control measure. The timing ofa potential filibuster was unclear.   In action on another part of the bill, the Senate narrowlyrejected a Republican attempt to toughen Democratic proposalsto curb appeals by death-row inmates. The Republicanamendment was defeated by a vote of 50-47, but will be put toanother vote today. Both versions of the limits on death-rowappeals would appear to overturn Supreme Court precedentrestricting such appeals, according to a Bush administrationlobbyist. The president has threatened to veto a bill thatwould have such an effect.   The omnibus anti-crime package has a long way to go beforereaching the White House. Even without a filibuster, a finalvote on the bill probably won't come until next week. TheHouse, meanwhile, is far behind in considering comparablelegislation.   Smarting from yesterday's defeat, the National RifleAssociation vowed to continue fighting the ban onsemi-automatic weapons. &quot;We lost a skirmish today,&quot; saidJames Baker, the NRA's director of federal affairs. Hepredicted another tough battle when the House debates anassault-weapon ban later this year.   The Senate version would bar for three years the import offive foreign-made assault weapons and the manufacture or saleof four domestic types. Even with the proposed ban, about adozen models of assault weapons would remain available in theU.S. In a seeming contradiction to its opposition to thismeasure, the Bush administration last year banned the importof certain assault rifles because they aren't suitable for oradaptable to &quot;sporting purposes.&quot;   Gun-control advocates contend that assault weapons don'thave any legitimate use and have become favorites amongcriminals.   The Senate defeated an amendment to kill the weapons banon a vote of 52-48. The narrow margin prompted opponents tomove for a second vote, but the Senate voted 50-49 not toreconsider. Sen. John Chafee (R., R.I.) didn't participate inthe second vote, and Minority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas,who initially voted for the gun-control measure for purelyparliamentary reasons, switched sides on the second vote.   In a desperation maneuver, NRA lobbyists contacted theoffice of Vice President Dan Quayle to secure his vote incase of a tie. But the vice president never appeared in theSenate yesterday, and the effort became moot when the pro-gunforces came up one vote short.   Several longtime NRA supporters ultimately supported theassault-weapon ban sponsored by Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D.,Ariz.) after voting against broader restrictions proposed bySen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio).   Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine, for example,risked angering hunters in his home state by voting for theDeConcini version. &quot;Our nation can accept some limits onfirearms ownership when the firearms in question have novalid hunting or sporting purpose,&quot; he said in a preparedstatement.</TEXT></DOC>
