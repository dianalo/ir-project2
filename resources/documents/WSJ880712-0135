Japan's three long-term credit banks are Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., or IBJ, Nippon Credit Bank Ltd. and Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.    According to one bank official, who asked not to be identified, IBJ and Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan each will reapply for 600 billion yen in the quarter, while Nippon Credit Bank will request 350 billion yen.    The figure contrasts with 815 billion yen in total lending originally projected for the three banks in the quarter. Under the original plan submitted in June, IBJ anticipated 350 billion yen in quarterly loans. Long-Term Credit Bank expected 280 billion yen, and Nippon Credit Bank 185 billion yen in loans.    The official emphasized that the banks made a new application to the central bank, which customarily oversees their quarterly lending levels, but that approval is pending.    The requested increase is designed to meet an increase in lending demand from Japanese electrical makers, constructors, leasing concerns and oil companies. The demand is being fueled by relatively easy credit conditions and funding requirements stemming from corporate restructuring in an expanding domestic economy. Sources said it also is being prompted by fears of an increase in Japan's prime lending rate later this year, which would increase borrowing costs. </TEXT></DOC>
