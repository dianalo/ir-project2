Had the ICC not intervened, the $122 million sale would have been closed last Friday, said Edward A. Burkhardt, Wisconsin Central's president and chief executive officer. Wisconsin Central is a new company formed by a group of Chicago businessmen to buy Lake States.    An ICC spokesman said the agency wants to give interested parties additional time to comment on the transaction. Much of the opposition to the sale has come from the 17 rail unions representing Soo Line employees, Mr. Burkhardt said. The transaction involves 1,801 miles of track that Soo Line, a Minneapolis-based rail and trucking concern, operates in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois and Minnesota.    If the ICC takes no action by Oct. 26, Soo Line may proceed with the sale as planned. However, an agency spokesman said the ICC may decide to order hearings held on the case, which could further postpone the sale, or impose conditions on the transaction to address concerns about potential adverse effects. The period for public comment ends Sept. 25, the spokesman added. Soo Line and Wisconsin Central will have until Oct. 2 to respond to opposition to the sale.    Soo Line said earlier this year it would take a one-time after-tax charge of $8 million to $15 million once it closes the sale. In 1986, Soo Line posted a $43.3 million loss on revenue of $631.8 million. The loss included an $82 million pretax restructuring charge and a $9.7 million gain from a building sale. </TEXT></DOC>
