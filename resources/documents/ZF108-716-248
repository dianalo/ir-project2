Hendershott, executive directorof the Navy comptroller's standard systems activity.andM;Although he declined to talk about the CIM effort and NAVSCIP's chances forultimate acceptance in DOD, Hendershott said during a recent interview he canappreciate the challenges awaiting those who would consolidate existingsystems across DOD.andM;&quot;It's very hard to replace 10 different systems with one,&quot; Hendershott saidfrom his office at Saufley Field in Pensacola, Fla.andP;  &quot;You're doing 10different conversions, which means you have 10 different sets of requirementsthe systems are serving.&quot;andM;To date, the Navy has replaced two of the 10 older, batch-oriented systemswith NAVSCIPS.andP;  &quot;The new system was designed so we could decentralize thedata entry piece [of civilian payroll processing] but centralize the payrollcalculation piece,&quot; Hendershott said.andM;&quot;NAVSCIPS was also designated to reduce the number of Navy payroll officesfrom 59 to 39 but give personnel in those offices more local control overtheir own destinies,&quot; he said.andM;System 36 minicomputers from IBM Corp. and IBM 3192 terminals in thoseoffices give Navy payroll workers not only more automation than they once hadbut also closer control over the data, which ultimately is fed to mainframesperforming larger finance management tasks.andM;The Navy plans to support civilian payroll processing with an Hitachi DataSystems mainframe running IBM operating system and database managementsoftware in the Washington, D.C., branch of the Navy Regional Data AutomationCenter (NARDAC) network of ADP facilities.andP;  The System 36s and the terminalswill have their own access to the NARDAC mainframe over the Navy Network.andM;NAVSCIPS will save the Navy about $66 million over its 12-year life cycle,Hendershott said.andP;  Much of this reduction will come from lower softwaremaintenance costs.andP;  Hendershott said civilian payroll processing has beendone by systems comprising 4.3 million lines of code maintained by 10different Navy organizations.andM;NAVSCIPS will cut that to about 600,000 lines maintained by a staff of 78.andO;The older systems were written in Cobol, and so is NAVSCIPS, he said.andM;The new system gives payroll officers online access to most of the functionsinvolved in getting the 330,000 Navy civilians paid, which include trackingattendance and producing earnings statements.andM;It also automates functions associated with issuing retirement andretroactive paychecks that were previously manual processes, Hendershottsaid.andP;  About $6 million per year will be saved by reduced staffing in payrolloffices, he said.andM;Conversion to NAVSCIPS takes nine months to a year each time one of the 10older systems is switched over, a process that so far has occurred twice,Hendershott said.andP;  Much of the installation interval is spent on trainingemployees.andM;He said that by 1992 the Navy hopes to have its entire civilian payrollsystem converted to NAVSCIPS, which will require conversions at eight moresites.andP;  The process has begun at six of those sites, he said.andM;The Navy began planning the upgrade in 1982 with some contractor assistance,Hendershott said.andP;  The System 36 configurations and terminals were procuredas part of a NAVSCIPS contract with Federal Computer Corp. of Falls Church,Va.andP;  OAO Corp. in Greenbelt, Md., was another NAVSCIPS contractor.andM;&quot;But for about the last year and a half we've been finishing the coding andimplementing the system ourselves,&quot; he said.andM;Pentagon officials have said that the Army, Air Force and Defense LogisticsAgency also have plans for upgrades of their civilian payroll systems on thedrawing board or in the early stages of development.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
