The citizenship law requires commercial fishing boat owners andcaptains to be U.S. citizens.   Alan Sparer, a lawyer for the Vietnamese Fishermen's Associationand six individual fishermen who challenged the law, said he wouldappeal.   He said 30 to 100 boat owners in northern California would beput out of work under the ruling, along with their crews.   The Vietnamese refugees have been granted permanent residence inthe United States while applying for citizenship, a process thatcan take seven years. They insist they compete very little with therest of the fishing industry.   The Vietnamese said many were forced to stop fishing and somewere threatened with confiscation of their boats when the CoastGuard, after years of non-enforcement, started enforcing the lawlast November and fining them up to $500.   They obtained a temporary restraining order against the lawSept. 27, arguing that the citizenship requirement, passed in thepost-Revolutionary War period to protect the fledgling U.S. fishingfleet, unconstitutionally deprived resident aliens of their rightto pursue their occupation.   But U.S. District Judge William Schwarzer ruled Monday that hehad no choice but to find that the Vietnamese fishermen had nochance of ultimately proving the law unconstitutional.   ``They have been poaching,'' he said.   The judge said Congress, out of concern for national securityand domestic commerce, had the authority to pass the law.   He also said the Vietnamese had been warned about enforcementfor up to five years.   ``It's not as if the government has suddenly jumped in and comedown with its ax without warning,'' the judge said. ``What thesepeople have been doing has been unlawful all the time. They havebeen able to build up a business because of limited enforcement.''</TEXT></DOC>
