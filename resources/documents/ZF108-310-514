(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>IEEE 802.6 MANandM;Metropolitan area networks (MANs) are designed to carry different types ofcommunication traffic simultaneously, allowing more stations to communicateover longer distances and at greater speeds than LANs.andP;  MANs can act asdigital backbone networks, providing an interconnection between homes, smallbusinesses, and corporate LANs.andP;  By design, they will also accommodate theintegration of voice, video, and data traffic.andP;  MAN media choices includeoptical fiber, CATV coaxial cable, and radio transmission.andM;The general characteristics of a MAN include:andM;* Very high data rates--typically in excess of 100 Mbps,andM;* Large geographic scope--from a new to several hundred kilometers,andM;* Many stations--theoretically any number, but practically limited to about1,000, andandM;* Low error rate--less than one bit error every [10.sup.9] bits.andM;The concept for metropolitan area networks clearly sprang from the LAN.andO;However, LAN technology doesn't apply to MANs in large part due to theinherent inefficiencies in most LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) schemes.andO;Contention schemes (e.g., Carrier Sense Multiple Access with CollisionDetection, or CSMA/CD), for example, have idle time on the line because ofcollisions and/or backoff; token passing has idle time on the medium due tothe required circulation of the token.andP;  These inefficiencies have a lowimpact on performance in the relatively small LAN.andP;  The larger geographicalscope of the magnifies the impact.andM;Evolution of MANandM;The IEEE 802 standards generally deal with LANs operating at speeds between 1and 20 Mbps, and include:andM;* IEEE 802.3--CSMA/CD, based upon Xerox, Intel, and DEC's Ethernet;andM;* IEEE 802.4--Token-passing Bus, based upon the General Motor's ManufacturingAutomation Protocol (MAP); andandM;* IEEE 802.5--Token Ring, based upon IBM's Token Ring.andM;The many changes in the IEEE 802.6 standard, since formation in 1981, mirrorchanges in the industry, economy, and technology.andP;  Unlike the 802.3--.5committees, formed to create a standard around a specific MAC strategy, 802.6was instructed to find the best solution for building a MAN.andM;Early 802.6 proposals used time division protocols similar to those found insatellite communications.andP;  In fact, MANs were seen originally as a way ofproviding the satellite communications industry with an economical,high-speed network for connections between ground stations and customers.andO;These schemes were also well suited to the installed base of CATV (broadband)cable.andM;Data communications via satellite did not become as pervasive as expected,and the push by that industry to create MAN standards diminishedsignificantly by the mid-1980s.andP;  Except for a few notable exceptions, theCATV industry has also shied away from carrying large amounts of datatraffic.andP;  The committee rejected an early proposal based on radio networksbecause of the less-than-1-Mbps operating speed involved.andM;In late 1984, Burroughs led a group that proposed an optical fiber solution.andO;Their proposal started as a 50-Mbps slotted ring, but later the speed wasreduced to 43 Mbps for compatibility with digital carriers in use by thetelephone industry.andP;  The speed required by this proposal, well above the20-Mbps maximum of other 802 standards, led the IEEE to authorize the 802.6committee to use any speed appropriate to the medium and MAC scheme.andM;Within two years, the Burroughs-led proposal was ready for the initialprocess that would lead to a formally adopted standard.andP;  After Burroughsmerged with Sperry in late 1986, however, Burroughs ceased funding researchin this area and the slotted ring proposal died.andM;Integrated Networks, a startup company comprising many former Burroughspeople, came up with a new, related proposal called the Multiplexed Slot andToken (MST).andP;  Although based upon the FDDI MAC scheme, MST overlaid 64-Kbpsslots for carrying time-sensitive data such as digitalized voice.andP;  MST alsooffered a greater number of choices of operating speed and media than didFDDI.andP;  MST, however, never really gained wholehearted support of thecommittee.andM;During this same time frame (mid-to late-1986), Telecom Australia proposed acompeting MAN strategy, called Queued Packet and Synchronous Exchange (QPSX).andO;QPSX was a radical departure from FDDI (and MST): It uses a dual-bus topologyrather than a ring; it supports a wide range of speeds and media; and it usesa very different MAC scheme.andP;  QPSX has received enthusiastic support,especially by ATandamp;T, Bellcore, most of the regional Bell operating companies,other telephone companies, and several fiber by-pass operators.andP;  In 1987, itbecame clear that most of the committee preferred QPSX, and they dropped theMST proposal.andM;Telecom Australia formed a company called QPSX Communications to furtherdevelop QPSX technology.andP;  To avoid confusion between the standard and thecompany/product, the 802.6 committee renamed the QPSX proposal to DistributedQueue Dual Bus (DQDB).andM;The support of DQDB by the telephone industry is an important consideration.andO;Since the divestiture of ATandamp;T in 1984, the telephone companies have lookedfor ways to provide new services, especially data transport.andP;  Furthermore,initial public MAN service offerings will undoubtedly be made by thetelephone companies since they possess both the facilities and the budgets.andM;DQDB OverviewandM;The IEEE 802.6 standard describes DQDB subnetworks which can interconnectthrough bridges, routers, gateways, or other networks to form a MAN (SeeFigure 1.).andP;  As a public network, DQDB subnets can provide switching androuting for high-speed data, voice, and video applications, as well as theinterconnection of private DQDB subnets and other private networks.andP;  Aprivate DQDB network can interconnect host computers, terminals, LANs, PBXs,and videoconferencing services.andM;The IEEE will probably formally adopt the 802.6 standard by the end of 1990.andO;It will then be forwarded to the International Organization forStandardization (ISO), as have IEEE 802.2-.5, for approval as ISO 8802-6.andM;DQDB ProtocolandM;ArchitectureandM;The 802.6 standard defines a highspeed network using the DQDB topology and aMAC scheme (See Figure 2.).andP;  Since the network utilizes a dual-bus topology,every station has two transmission links and two buses.andP;  Bus A and Bus Boperate in opposite directions of transmission.andM;The 802.6 Physical Layer corresponds to the OSI Physical Layer and specifieshow to use different underlying transmission media and speeds.andP;  The standardcurrently describes support for the following options:andM;* The North American telephone Digital Signaling level three (DS-3) rate of44.736 Mbps (per ANSI standard);andM;* European digital telephone signaling level three and four rates of 34.368Mand 139.264 Mbps (per CCITT's standard); orandM;* The optical fiber Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) rate of 155.520 Mbps(per CCITT and ANSI Synchronous Optical Network, or SONET, standards).andM;The standard does not specify a maximum bus length nor a maximum number ofstations; these characteristics depend on the transmission system used by thenetwork.andM;The Physical Layer Convergence Protocol (PLCP), part of the Physical Layer,adapts the capabilities of the transmission system to provide the serviceexpected by the DQDB Layer.andP;  The PLCP will be different for everytransmission system, but it is this part of the Physical Layer that allowsthe wide range of media and speed options supported by the network.andM;The 802.6 DQDB Layer is equivalent to the MAC Sublayer of the 802.3--.5 LANstandards and roughly corresponds to the OSI Data Link Layer.andP;  It willprovide support for higher layer services.andP;  At this time, the 802.6 standardspecifies that the DQDB Layer is required to support:andM;* Connectionless (datagram) MAC service to the IEEE 802.2 Logical LinkControl (LLC) sublayer, consistent with other IEEE 802 LANs;andM;* connection-oriented (virtual circuit) data service for the transfer ofbursty data, such as signaling or packetized voice; andandM;* Connection-oriented (virtual circuit) isochronous service: &quot;isochronous&quot;refers to the limiting characteristic of an event or signal recurring atknown, periodic intervals, such as conventional digitized voice or video.andM;The MAC, Connection-oriented, and Isochronous Convergence Functions enhancethe access control functions of the DQDB Layer to meet the requirements ofthe higher layer service.andP;  Again, these convergence functions will bedifferent for each type of higher layer service, but provide the DQDBprotocol with enormous flexibility in terms of the services that can besupported.andM;The three types of higher layer services are supported by employing twoaccess methods.andP;  The Queued Arbitrated access method supports those servicesthat are not time-sensitive.andP;  A distributed queue access method allows usersto request access to the medium as needed.andP;  This access method supports theconnectionless MAC service and the connection-oriented data service.andM;The Pre-Arbitrated access method assigns specific octet positions within atransmission slot for use by different stations with time-sensitiveapplications.andP;  This access method supports isochronous connection-orientedservices.andM;Finally, the Layer Management Entities (LME) provide network managementfunctions for each layer, compatible with the network management proceduresof IEEE 802.1,andM;DQDB Physical TopologyandM;A DQDB network utilizes a dual-bus topology comprising two unidirectionalbuses and multiple nodes.andP;  The two buses, called Bus A and Bus B, supporttransmission in opposite directions, allowing full-duplex communicationbetween any pair of nodes.andP;  A given node, however, must know which bus to useto communicate with another node.andM;Bus A and Bus B operate independently of each other.andP;  Since both buses areoperational at all times, the effective capacity of the DQDB subnet is twicethe capacity of a single bus.andM;The transmission on each bus are formatted as fixed length entities called&quot;slots.&quot;andP;  Nodes on the bus may write into slots according to the rules of theaccess protocol, discussed below.andP;  All slots originate at the head of the busand terminate at the end of the bus.andM;Each node of the subnet comprises an Access Unit (AU) and the physicalattachment of the AU to the two buses.andP;  The access unit performs the node'sDQDB Layer functions and attaches to each bus with a single read-and-writeconnection.andM;A key feature of DQDB is that the operation of the bus is independent of theoperation of the individual AUs.andP;  Therefore, access units may fail or beremoved from the network without causing operational problems elsewhere inthe network.andP;  The node at the head of the bus performs special &quot;head of bus&quot;functions such as regularly creating empty transmission slots into which theother nodes on the bus write.andM;Timing is another important consideration.andP;  Under normal conditions, thenetwork has a single source for slot timing to ensure that all nodes transferdata at the same rate.andP;  This is essential to ensure the correct operation ofthe DQDB access scheme and see that the isochronous service won't have timingslips.andM;If connected to a public network with isochronous service, then an externalsource, usually the public network, must provide timing for the DQDB subnet.andO;In other cases, a node within the DQDB network will suffice; typically thehead of Bus A.andM;DQDB Fault ToleranceandM;Another important feature of DQDB is the ability of the network to healitself in the case of bus failure.andP;  A special case of the dual bus topology,called a looped dual bus, may be employed in a DQDB network.andP;  This topologyis a fault-tolerant implementation where one node acts as both head and endof the bus (See Figure 3.).andM;When a break occurs in the cable (due to mechanical failure, rodents chewingthrough the wire or what have you), the network automatically reconfiguresitself so that the natural break in the network loop appears at thecorresponding position of the physical break in the cable.andP;  Thereconfiguration procedure, then, moves the head of bus functions to the nodesadjacent to the cable break (See Figure 4.).andM;If a node adjacent to the cable break does not support the head of busfunctions, then the reconfiguration will be completed by the node nearest tothe break that does support these functions.andP;  Whenever this happens, the nodeor nodes without the head of bus capability are effectively dropped off thenetwork.andM;DQDB Access ControlandM;DQDB networks must support a variety of services, as described earlier.andO;Applications requiring isochronous service are time-sensitive; i.e., theapplication must be granted access to the medium on a regular, periodicbasis.andP;  Isochronous service would be used, for example, for digitized voiceapplications.andP;  This application requires access to the medium on a regularbasis and a guaranteed bandwidth of 64 Kbps.andP;  Time slots for isochronousservice uses the Pre-Arbitrated (PA) access method, which reserves time onthe medium for various time-sensitive applications.andM;Non-time-sensitive applications do not require medium access on a regular,periodic basis.andP;  This includes both the connectionless MAC andconnection-oriented data services supported by DQDB.andP;  These applications needto have access to the medium only when they have data to send.andP;  Therefore,time on the medium is not reserved for specific applications but granted onan as-needed basis.andP;  The Queued Arbitrated (QA) access method is used forthese services.andM;Queued Arbitrated AccessandM;MethodandM;The QA access method is elegant and straightforward, but relativelycomplicated when compared to CSMA/CD and token passing (or even FDDI).andP;  TheQA access method supports services that are usually bursty in nature; i.e.,andO;the bulk of the data transfer occurs in a relatively small amount of time.andO;The unit of transmission is called a &quot;QA slot,&quot; comprising a header and afixed-length data filed (called a &quot;QA segment&quot;).andM;The operation of the access protocol depends upon two fields within the QAslot header.andP;  The BUSY bit indicates whether fhis slot is empty or not andthe REQUEST field indicates whether a QA segment is being queued fortransmission.andM;In short (leaving out a lot of detail), here is how the QA access protocolworks.andP;  Recall that the DQDB network comprises two unidirectional buses.andP;  Theterms &quot;upstream&quot; and &quot;downstream&quot; indicate the relative positions of twonodes on the bus.andP;  Node i is upstream of Node j if a slot arrives at Node ibefore it arrives at Node j; Node j, then, is downstream of Node i.andM;When Node i is ready to transmit to Nodej, Node i must determine which bus touse.andP;  Let's assume that Node i will use Bus A.andP;  Node i, then, sets a bit inthe REQUEST field of the next available slot on Bus B.andP;  In this way, allnodes downstream of Node i on Bus B will see the request and appropriatelyincrement a counter.andP;  Note that all nodes downstream of Node i on Bus B areupstream of Node i on Bus A.andM;All nodes upstream of Node i on Bus A know how many prior requests are in thequeue before them because of the counter that each maintains (although theydo not know which nodes made requests).andP;  The counter tells each node how manyrequests are pending in the queue and, therefore, how many empty slots thenode must let go by before it has a turn to access the medium.andP;  As emptyslots pass each node, their counters are decremented.andP;  When its counter iszero, Node i may write data into an empty slot, which will travel downstreamon Bus A to Node j.andM;The rest of this section will examine the QA access protocol in more detail.andO;First, we must define two new terms, namely &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;reverse&quot; bus.andO;Assume that Node i wishes to send a segment to Node j and will use Bus A.andP;  Inthis case, Bus A is the forward bus and Bus B is the reverse bus.andM;Recall that the header of every QA slot contains a BUSY bit and a REQUESTfield.andP;  Requests to use the forward bus are placed in slots traveling on thereverse bus.andM;Each node tracks the number of slot requests that have been queued downstreamon the forward bus by counting the number of bits set in the REQUEST field ofslots on the reverse bus.andP;  This tells the node the length of the queue.andO;Whenever an empty slot passes this node, it means that someone on the queueis being served.andP;  The request (RQ) counter, then, is incremented for everyREQUEST passing on the reverse bus and decremented for every empty slotpassing on the forward bus (Figure 5).andM;When a node wants to send a QA segment, it enters a &quot;queued to send&quot; stateand invokes another counter called the countdown (CD) counter.andP;  When a nodehas a QA segment to send, it transfers the value of the RQ counter to the CDcounter and resets the RQ counter to zero.andP;  The RQ counter now counts thenumber of new requests, and the CD counter tracks the node's position in thequeue (See Figure 6).andP;  When the value of the CD counter is zero, the node isallowed to transmit its QA segment in the next empty QA slot.andP;  While waitingfor the CD value to become zero, the RQ counter continues to count newrequests.andP;  (Figures 7a-7h stp through an example of the QA access protocol.)andM;DQDB supports multiple QA priorities on each bus.andP;  The REQUEST field of eachslot contains four bits to provide a four-level priority scheme.andP;  The accessprocedures described here are essentially the same for the multiplepriorities, where separate RQ and CD counters are maintained for eachpriority level (Refer to the standard for additional information.).andM;Pre-Arbitrated AccessandM;MethodandM;The Pre-Arbitrated (PA) access scheme is designed for the transfer ofisochronous service octets.andP;  Access to PA slots is very different than accessto QA slots.andP;  PA slots, like QA slots, have a fixed length.andP;  Whereas a QAslot is wholly owned by a single node at a time, however, the differentoctets within a single PA slot may be used by different nodes.andM;The heads of bus takes responsibility for sending a sufficient number of PAslots to ensure that all isochronous service users have adequate band-widthavailable.andP;  When the head of bus generates a PA slot, it places a VirtualChannel Identifier (VCI) into the slot header.andP;  All nodes with an isochronousservices examine the VCI in the passing PA slots.andP;  For each VCI value thatthe node must access, the node will maintain a table indicating which octetposition(s) within the slot that it should use for reading and writing.andO;Thus, the node will read from the appropriate octet positions within the slotand write to other positions within the slot.andP;  It ignores all other octets.andO;IF the PA slot contains a VCI that is not used by this node, the entire slotis ignored.andM;DQDB TransmissionandM;FormatsandM;Compared to most other protocols, the DQDB frame format(s) are complicatedsince the DQDB network will split apart large messages.andP;  This sectiondescribes the basic concepts of the DQDB protocol data units.andM;DQDB receives data from higher protocol layers in the &quot;MAC&quot; service dataunit.&quot;andP;  The MAC service data unit is a message that will be sent from onenode to another and may be from zero to 9,188 octets in length.andP;  The MACservice data unit is carried in the information field of an Initial MACProtocol Data Unit (PDU), or IMPDU.andP;  The IMPDU comprises four fields:andM;*Header--includes protocol information specific to the MAC layer, addresses,a protocol identifier, and a quality of service indication.andP;  802.6 supportsseveral address formats, including 16-and 48-bit addresses, like the other802 MAC protocols, and 60-bit ISDN addresses.andP;  The header is 24 to 44 octetsin length (in increments of four);andM;*Information--contains a MAC service data unit;andM;*PAD--additional octets to pad the length of the information field so that itis a multiple of four.andP;  The PAD is zero, one, two, or three octets in length;andandM;*Trailer--includes miscellaneous protocol information.andP;  The trailer is fouroctets in length.andM;An initial MAC PDU is too large to be sent over the network as a singletransmission entity.andP;  Therefore, it is split up into fixed-length blockscalled &quot;segmentation units,&quot; that are 44 octets in length.andP;  Nodes areresponsible for fragmenting an IMPDU into segmentation units and reassemblingsegmentation units back into an IMPDU.andP;  An IMPDU may be between 28 and 9,236octets in length, thus between one and 210 segmentation units will berequired to transport a single IMPDU.andM;Each segmentation unit has a header and trailer associated with it, forming a48-octet Derived MAC Protocol Data Unit, or DMPDU.andP;  The fields of a DMPDUare:andM;*DMPDU Header (DH)--contains two items of information.andP;  The first identifiesthis segmentation unit as the beginning, middle, or end of an IMPDU, or as asingle segment IMPDU.andP;  The second item helps the receiving node reassemblethe IMPDU;andM;*Segmentation Unit--If this is the final (or only) segment, some number ofpadding octets may be required; andandM;*DMPDU Trailer (DT)--comprises two subfields.andP;  The first subfield indicatesthe number of octets of the segmentation unit that contain IMPDU information.andO;The second subfield is part of the error detection scheme and contains acyclic redundancy check (CRC) remainder over the rest of the DMPDU.andM;Every DMPDU is carried in the 48-octet &quot;segment payload&quot; field of a QAsegment.andP;  A PA segment is a collection of 48 octets for isochronous serviceusers.andM;A segment has a four-octet segment header in addition to the segment payloadfield.andP;  Segment header information includes:andM;*A Virtual Channel Identifier (VCI)--used to identify the virtual channel towhich the segment belongs;andM;*Payload Type--differentiates user data from othe types of information, suchas network signaling information;andM;*Segment Priority; andandM;*Header Check Sequence--provides for the detection of bit errors, andcorrection of single-bit errors, in the segment header.andM;Finally, the basic unit of transmission is the &quot;slot.&quot;andP;  A 53-octet slotcomprises a single-octet &quot;access control field&quot;, followed by the 52-octetsegment (a PA slot contains a PA segment and a QA slot contains a QAsegment).andP;  The access control field includes:andM;*The BUSY bit--used to indicate whether the slot is empty or full (QA Slotonly);andM;*A Slot Type Indicator--specifies whether this is a PA slot or A slot; andandM;*The REQUEST Field--comprising four bits so that nodes may request bus accessin each of the four different priority levels.andM;Note that although a PA segment and QA segment have the same format, they areused differently by the network nodes.andP;  If an empty QA slot is seen at a nodequeued for access, that node can set the slot busy and write a QA segmentinto it.andP;  There is no concept, however, of an empty or full PA slot.andP;  When anode supporting isochronous service sees a PA slot, it examines the VCI.andP;  Ifthe node must access the VCI supplied in the segment header, the node willread from and/or write to specified octets within the segment payload.andP;  Thus,many isochronous service users share the octets in the Segment Payload, andno one node owns a PA slot.andM;MAN'S FutureandM;Although QPSX Communications holds the patent rights for some inventionsrequired for compliance with the standard, the company is producing productssupporting the DQDB protocol and has agreed to grant licenses for its use.andO;DQDB-based MANs are already being trialed, notably in Philadelphia (Bell ofPennsylvania) and Melbourne (Telecom Australia).andP;  Bell operating companiesSwitched Multi-megabit Data Service (SMDS) will probably offer initial public802.6 networks for the U.S.andP;  in the early 1990s.andP;  Widespread use of thisprotocol will probably not appear until 1991 or '92.andM;Many sources view MANs as early implementations of Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN).andO;In particular, DQDB is widely touted as providing many of the same servicesas an ISDN; namely, digital signaling, high rates of speed (well above theISDN Primary Rate Interface speed of 1,544 or 2.048 Mbps), and theintegration of voice, video, and data.andP;  The infrastructure that MANs providemay well become integral to the deployment of B-ISDN.andP;  (The term &quot;broadband&quot;comes from its telephony sense, i.e.andP;  any channel wider than 3.4 KHz, and notbecause it uses broadband cable.andP;  In fact, most B-ISDN networks will usefiber cabling.)andM;The DQDB has been designed to support the current digital hierarchiescommonly used in the telephone industry, much like ISDN.andP;  Furthermore, DQDBwill also operate with the synchronous digital hierachy for optical fibernetworks, which may also be the basis for B-ISDN's Asynchronous TransferMode.andP;  The ANSI T1S1.1 Task Group, one of the bodies responsible for U.S.andO;ISDN standards, has recommended DQDB as the preferred multi-plexing schemefor B-ISDN.andP;  In addition, the DQDB Slot Header format will probably becompatible with headers specified in the T1S1 B-ISDN standards.andP;  These factsplace DQDB in an excellent position for a transition into ISDN.andP;  Thesecomments are not meant to downplay the importance of FDDI.andP;  As LANs willremain an important communications strategy will into the ISDN era, privateLAN internetworks and backbones will also be required.andP;  It is in thisenvironment that FDDI will remain a very strong contender.andM;Gary C.
