In neighboring Romania, Yugoslav media reported authorities haveextended restricted border zones and decreed border guards can usearms to stop Romanians trying to flee to Hungary and Yugoslavia.   Hungary's admission came in an MTI state news agency report that14 East Germans were caught illegally crossing the border fromCzechoslovakia, the only country East Germans can visit withoutpermission from their Communist government.   East Germans who escaped have told Western reporters that somerisked two illegal crossings _ from Czechoslovakia and then intoAustria _ but there had been no official word before Friday.   MTI also announced that armed workers' militiamen have joinedborder patrols to stop the exodus.   Only 85 East Germans made it to Austria overnight, compared withhundreds each night earlier this week, said a West German diplomatin Vienna who asked for anonymity.   ``Restrictions have been introduced along the border to cope withthe chaotic situation there,'' said a spokesman for Hungary's borderguards.   Hungarian officials declined to say whether they acted underpressure from their Warsaw Pact ally, East Germany.   MTI said 38 workers' militia squads have patrolled the border inrecent weeks, while another 244 militiamen are helping guards inGyoer-Sopron border region.   In West Germany, the Bavarian state government said Friday itopened a third reception camp for East German refugees because twoopened this summer are overwhelmed.   Officials said they Thursday took 108 East Germans to the newcamp, near Nuremberg. The refugees had spent up to a month at theWest German Embassy in Budapest.   About 5,000 East Germans have reached the West across theHungarian-Austrian border since the exodus began in the second halfof July, after Hungary began dismantling border barriers.   Escapees arriving Thursday in Austria's easternmost Burgenlandprovince said police are turning back would-be refugees.   They and Austrian sources said cars with East German licenseplates no longer are allowed to enter the town of Sopron, less thansix miles from the border.   A mass escape bid by East Germans who arrived at the border inthree buses and three taxis was thwarted Wednesday, Hungarian mediareported.   An East German turned back in that convoy later managed to dashto Austria and told reporters that border guards wielded truncheonsto force back people walking toward the border.   The Austria Press Agency said Friday that 10 Romanians were amongrefugees who crossed near Moerbisch on Lake Neusiedl.   Hungary gives asylum to Romanian citizens, most of them ethnicHungarians, but many want to be in the West and cannot get entryvisas.   Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency Friday quoted the RomanianOfficial Gazette as saying no permanent residential settlements willbe permitted near the border, and ``protective works'' and alarmsystems are being constructed.   The decree also gave border guards greater latitude to usefirearms to prevent ``arrested persons or those assisting them''from escaping.</TEXT></DOC>
