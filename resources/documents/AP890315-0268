Environmentalists are pleased with their initial success threeyears after they began challenging governments, industries andbanks. But an area the size of a soccer field is destroyed eachminute, and the young preservation movement seeks fundamentalchanges in political, economic and social structures to save theteeming jungles of South America, Africa and Southeast Asia.   An aggressive campaign of publicity, education and confrontationbegan in 1985 and appeared to capture the world's attention lastyear. Almost overnight, it seemed, world leaders began calling forgreater efforts to halt the chopping and burning of rain forests.Conferences discussed such technical conservation issues as``sustainable management.'' Rock stars Sting and The Grateful Deadplayed benefit concerts for the cause. Media coverage increased.   Some recent fruits of that effort:   _Brazil in October announced suspension of tax benefits forlandowners who destroy the Amazon rain forest, the largest andfastest-disappearing on Earth.   _The International Tropical Timber Organization approved a $4million project in northern Brazil that calls for loggers to consultwith environmental groups, government agencies, native Indians andlocal workers to plan long-term forest development and preservation.   _Some 500 Brazilian Indians from 20 tribes gathered last month tooppose planned hydroelectric dams in the Amazon that could floodrain forest areas, including their homes. The meeting was the firstby the tribes, which traditionally have battled over territory andremained isolated.   _Thailand imposed a nationwide logging ban afterenvironmentalists blamed uncontrolled timber harvesting for floodsthat killed more than 350 people in November. Last April, officialssuspended plans for a hydroelectric dam that environmentalists saidwould have ruined Thailand's last virgin rain forest.   _West Germany earmarked about $80 million for saving tropicalforests.   ``Without a coherent strategy for protecting the tropical forestsin which everyone concerned participates, we cannot master the vastproblems threatening the future of all mankind,'' said West GermanChancellor Helmut Kohl.   ``We have to be ambitious. We're in trouble,'' said RandallHayes, head of the U.S.-based Rainforest Action Network. ``If wedon't get the changes we need in the next five years, then we'velost the rain forests.''   The results could be catastrophic.   Rain forests cover some 2.4 billion acres of the planet, abouthalf the original amount, ecologists say.   Sometimes called the ``lungs of the Earth,'' they act as apollution filter, absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. Ifcarbon dioxide isn't removed from the atmosphere, it can trap heat,which some scientists say causes a global warming trend called thegreenhouse effect. Burning the rain forests, a common way to createarable land, also adds carbon to the atmosphere.   Rain forests are storehouses of plant, insect and animal species,some of which could prove useful for drugs and other scientificendeavors. Scientists say only a small percentage of the 5 millionspecies in the forests, many of them unique to the tropicalenvironment, have been studied.   In addition, 200 million people live in and around rain forests,including indigenous tribes who depend on them for sustenance andshelter.   Nonetheless, preservation presents complexities that cut acrosssocial and political boundaries. Many rain forests are in developingcountries that need to capitalize on their natural resources andmust borrow money for costly modernization projects, such ashighways and power plants.   Brazil, for example, has the developing world's largest foreigndebt at $115 billion. Two of its limited number of export productsare beef and timber _industries that cause major forest destruction.Cattle ranchers burn forests to create grazing land; loggers clearjungle in search of exotic hardwoods.   Meanwhile, poor farmers burn small tracts to grow crops. Thesoil, so fertile under the rain forest canopy, is then leached ofnutrients in seasonal heavy rains, forcing farmers to move on andburn another patch every few years.   Last fall, Brazilian President Jose Sarney suspended tax benefitsfor land developers and banned exports of unprocessed tropicaltimber. ``We must create nationwide consciousness that we are allpassengers in the adventure of man on Earth. The era of unlimitednatural resources is over,'' he said.   But environmentalists contend the harmful practices continue.Now, Brazil is balking at proposals to swap some of its foreign debtfor saving parcels of rain forest. Such plans would entail creationof an international commission to watch over the preserved jungle.   ``We can't turn the Amazon into a sort of national park forhumanity,'' Brazil's foreign minister, Roberto de Abreu Sodre, said.``Our priority is economic development. We're open to internationalsuggestions, but not those that interfere in Brazilian sovereignty.''   Industrial giants such as the United States and Europeancountries, which have little or no rain forest, have been the mostvocal about the developing nations' efforts to halt the destruction.That causes particular resentment.   A conference of eight nations in the Amazon region, includingBrazil, earlier this month issued a declaration rejecting foreigninterference while saying development must preserve the environmentand wild resources.   ``Part of the problem is that it's coming down to the developedcountries versus the developing countries,'' said a U.S. activistwho monitors the World Bank, the largest source of aid to developingnations.   ``They (developing countries) say, `You raped your countries toget developed, and now you're stopping us from doing it,''' said theactivist, who spoke on condition his name not be used.   But N.F. Potter, Canada's executive director at the 151-nationWorld Bank, said: ``There are ways of doing things without makingthe same mistakes.''   The World Bank has been criticized by environmentalists, who sayit ignores ecological issues when funding projects. At issue arebillions of dollars; in the fiscal year ending June 30, the bankexpects to loan a record $21 billion.   ``These bankers are unbelievably ignorant. They are absolutelyreckless,'' said Brent Blackwelder of the U.S.-based EnvironmentalPolicy Institute.   Under increasing pressure from member nations and environmentalgroups not to fund ecologically harmful projects, the bank set up adepartment in 1987 to assess the potential damage of developmentprojects.   ``You can see a lot more environmental consciousness than therewas two years ago,'' said an official with a U.S. agency thatmonitors aid. ``There has been movement. I'm not saying there hasbeen all the movement necessary.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
