The order, potentially valued at $5 billion, would be a blow toAirbus Industrie, the European consortium that recently appeared tohave gained a firm foothold with the carrier, the Journal said.   Northwest also was said to be considering six firm orders andfour options for new Boeing 747-400 jumbo jets that seat as many as412 passengers, the Journal said.   Northwest paid an estimated $96 million each for 747s when theywere first ordered in 1985. Now, Seattle-based Boeing prices the747-400, its most expensive jetliner, at $116 million to $136million apiece.   It wasn't known whether Northwest's new owners have given finalapproval to all details in the order, the newspaper reported.   Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen said today the airline wouldhave no comment on the report.   ``It's no secret that we've been negotiating,'' Whalen said. Buthe wouldn't say whether the company has settled on a contract withone of the industry's three suppliers: Boeing, Airbus or McDonnellDouglas Corp.   Industry sources have said that Alfred Checchi, the Los Angelesinvestor who led the group that recently bought Northwest parentNWA Inc., has shown a strong preference for American-made aircraft,the Journal said.   Steven Rothmeier, NWA's recently departed chairman, had forgedthe carrier's recent link with Airbus, the newspaper said.   Jack Gamble, public relations manager for Boeing CommercialAirplanes, said today he could not confirm the report.   Gamble acknowledged that Boeing has been talking with Northwest``for quite some time,'' but said any announcement of orders mustcome from Boeing customers.   According to the Journal, Airbus submitted a rival bid for 40orders and 40 options on the new stretched version of the A320,which is comparable in size to the 757.   In June, Northwest said it became the first carrier in NorthAmerica to receive a high-technology low-noise Airbus A320 jetliner.   The $30 million plane was the first to be delivered from anorder by Northwest for 25 medium-range Airbus A320 aircraft; sinceJune, six A320s have been delivered and are in service. TheEagan-based airline also has options for 75 additional A320aircraft to be delivered through 1995.   The total order, including spare parts, is valued at $3.2billion.   Northwest also has 16 Airbus A330 aircraft on order for use inNorth Atlantic and high-volume domestic routes. Those two-engineaircraft carry 330 passengers and cost $86 million each.   Northwest also has on order 20 Airbus A340s, a four-enginewide-body jet that carries 280 passengers. Those jets will be usedon lower-volume routes in the Pacific and also to provide extracapacity for very high-volume trans-Pacific routes.   The company also has four options to purchase A330s or A340s,said Northwest spokesman Doug Miller. Checchi has said he intendsto take delivery of the jets ordered by Rothmeier.   The 747-400 planes, which have an 8,000-mile range, are expectedto be used to expand Northwest's Pacific routes, the Journal said.The carrier already has five 747-400s in its fleet, with five moreon order, Miller said.</TEXT></DOC>
