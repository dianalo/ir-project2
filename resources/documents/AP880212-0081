Foreign relief sources in Ethiopia said Thursday that Ethiopiantroops opened fire on thousands of drought victims when civiliansresisted forced resettlement. Twenty people were killed and manyothers wounded, the sources said, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   The sources said the shootings occurred Monday at the northerntown of Korem in Tigray Province, 525 miles north of the capital,Addis Ababa.   ``No one in his right mind can imagine that any responsibleperson can commit such an atrocity against drought victims,'' thecommission said.   The commission said it had stated repeatedly that theresettlement program was voluntary.   Tigray and its northern neighbor, Eritrea, are the hardest hitby a drought that threatens more than 5 million Ethiopians withstarvation. Drought in the northern regions has been exacerbated bya civil war in Eritrea.   Ethiopia's Marxist government began the resettlement program inNovember 1984 with a goal of moving 1.5 million people from theoverpopulated, drought-ravaged north to unused, fertile land in thesouth and west.   At least 600,000 people were resettled before the governmenthalted the program in February 1986 amid charges from the West thatpeople were being forced to move, sometimes at gunpoint. Criticssaid the government's aim is to depopulate the north, which is hometo two rebel movements.   Ethiopia resumed resettlement Nov. 25, promising the programwould be voluntary and humane.</TEXT></DOC>
