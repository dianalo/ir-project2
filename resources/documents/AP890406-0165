State Department officials formally notified Congress thatPresident Bush intends to raise, from 25,000 to 43,500, the refugeeadmissions ceiling this year for applicants from the Soviet Union.Moreover, they advanced legislation to create a new ``specialimmigrant'' category to accommodate up to 30,000 additionalapplicants.   But those initiatives didn't spare the administration from beinglambasted on Capitol Hill, where several lawmakers charged thatU.S. footdragging on the refugee issue remains a majorembarrassment to a nation which, after all, has fought for years toconvince Moscow to loosen its emigration policy.   Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., chairman of the House Judiciarysubcommittee on immigration, said the slow pace in whichapplications have been handled, and in many cases denied, runs therisk of destroying ``a tremendous victory for bipartisan foreignpolicy ... In short, let's not blow it.''   Morrison and several other members of Congress already hadfashioned alternative legislative measures designed to speed entryinto the United States by the nearly 8,000 Soviet citizens, half ofthem Jews, seeking refugee visas each month. Bush'scounter-proposals were served up just as the panel began hearingson those measures.   Meanwhile, another panel, the House Appropriations subcommitteeon foreign operations, approved the administration's request for$100 million in supplemental money this year to help pay for theincrease in refugee processing.   At Morrison's hearing, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., noted that atone point after Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev eased emigrationrestrictions in late 1987, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow only had oneperson assigned to handle the refugee applications. ``And the StateDepartment told us that was the consequence of appropriationsconstraints,'' Frank snapped. ``It was one of the three silliestthings the State Department has ever said, strong competitionnotwithstanding.''   According to the Council of Jewish Federations, more than 7,000Jews are stalled in Vienna and Rome, awaiting processing by theImmigration and Naturalization Service. Thousands of others, stillin the Soviet Union, have been told it could take as long as twoyears to get an initial screening interview at the U.S. Embassy inMoscow, the council says.   Despite Frank's persistent questioning, Jonathan Moore, U.S.coordinator for refugee affairs, declined to say whether theconsular and immigration staffs in Moscow would be substantiallybeefed up, noting there are mutual limits on the size of eachcountry's missions. But he suggested part of the problem in Moscowmay be eased by forwarding some of the paperwork to other U.S.offices for completion.   The last major Soviet emigration to the United States occurrednearly 10 years ago, when 28,400 people came as refugees. For thenext seven years, relatively few Soviets were permitted toemigrate, but it remained a matter of U.S. policy to grantautomatic refugee status to any Soviet citizen who got out andasked entry into America.   Following Gorbachev's policy change, more than 20,400 Sovietrefugees were admitted to the United States last fiscal year, analmost sixfold increase over the 1987 figure and a tide that caughtU.S. officials off guard. To the dismay of many refugee groups andmembers of Congress, the INS then switched gears and began denying,on a case-by-case basis, refugee visas to a substantial number ofapplicants. Such denials are based on findings that the applicanthas not demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution.   The General Accounting Office said Thursday that a total of4,919 Soviets had been denied refugee status from October 1988through March 31. In that period, 11,783 people were approved inVienna and Rome, while 2,073 were denied at those embassies.Meanwhile, 13,568 were approved at the Moscow embassy, and 4,919were denied there.   Virtually all of the Jews and Pentecostals leaving the SovietUnion are doing so with Israeli visas. But instead of going on toIsrael, the vast majority _ about 95 percent _ stop in Vienna orRome to apply for U.S. visas. Armenian emigres, on the other hand,constitute most of the refugee applicants applying directly at theU.S. Embassy in Moscow.   Bush's latest proposal would create a new, discretionarycategory of ``special immigrants'' as selected from time to time bythe president. They could become citizens, and would have otherrights and benefits shared by refugees.   Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., said the ``special immigrant''idea ``certainly does not address the long-term difficulties ofincreased immigration of refugees from the Soviet Union.''   INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson insisted ``our Soviet program isstill one of the most generous of all immigration programs.'' And``We wish to make it clear that absolutely no Soviet seeking reliefis forced to return to the Soviet Union.''</TEXT></DOC>
