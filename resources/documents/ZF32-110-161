(ERC) of Willowdale, Ont., attests Ness' comments in itslatest report on the portable market.andP;  The 1990 report says most new portableproduct introductions in late 1989 and 1990 incorporated processors otherthan the 8088.andP;  ERC expects 8088-based portables to account for a scant sevenper cent of total shipments this year.andM;&quot;While 80286-based units have taken over as the number one portable processorin 1990 and 1991, 80386SX and 80386 products will account for more thanone-half of all shipments in 1991, up dramatically from just over 20 per centin 1989,&quot; the research firm says.andM;Taking the technology even further, a Peabody, Mass.-based computing firmannounced in May what it claims is the world's smallest pesonal computerbased on Intel's 486 microprocessor.andM;Ergo Computing's the &quot;Moby Brick&quot; is targeted at users of Windows 3.0applications, desktop publishing packages or computer-aided design software,says Ergo president Tom Spalding.andM;&quot;These users are nto wellserved by the current generation of laptops andnotebooks, which don't offer state-of-the-art processing power,high-resolution graphics or large storage capacity,&quot; he said.andM;According to Bill Clough, president of Montreal-based MicroSlate, with somany portables available serving all kinds of purposes for the executiveuser, the market has become saturated.andM;Clough said his company is serving a market that everyone choe to ignore --the blue-colar sector.andP;  MicroSlate recently introduced its secondkeyboardless notebook computer, the Datellite 300, especially designed forblue-collar users.andM;Featuring 120 MB storage capacity, the Datellite 300 is useful fororganizations in the automated field systems arena, where work is carried outin the field -- often in less than ideal circumstances -- and involves asignificant volume of paperwork.andM;Clough said while areas of portbale computing are fairly saturated in thewhite collar market, in the blue collar market only 11 per cent havecomputers.andM;But will these blue-collar workers buy the $5,995 portable?andM;The Datellite 300 is an indication of what users will be seeing much more ofin the future, according to laptop product manager for NEC TechnologiesCanada Inc., Stan Ossias.andM;&quot;The market for portables has become so large that it will be increasinglyfragmented,&quot; he said in an interview.andM;&quot;We (as vendors) will satisfy more niche markets with specific types ofproduct,&quot; he said, adding the market has not yet reached the saturationpoint.andP;  &quot;We're still on the upward part of a curve that is accelerating.&quot;andM;For Bruce Sinclair, president of Richmond Hill, Ont.-based Dell ComputerCorp., the way a laptop vendor services its customers is what will make thedifference among the many portable vendors out there.andM;Earlier this year, Dell introduced its first full-featured, battery-powerednotebook computer which included Dell's new service program.andM;The service program was developed by Dell to meet the specialized needs ofthe company's notebook customers, said Sinclair.andP;  Included in the price ofeach system is a one-year, on-site service contract that provides next-daysystem replacement.andP;  When possible, on-site technicians will transferexisting data to the replacement unit.andM;&quot;Because a laptop or portable is a complex product to fix, it's differentthan a regular desktop,&quot; said Sinclair.andP;  &quot;It's not the type of thing that anyold technician could show up at your desk and change with a screwdriver.&quot;andM;Ness predicts one of the directions the portable market will take in thefuture will involve improved battery technology.andM;And with the miniaturization and integration of new technologies in theportable market, new issues such as the risk of theft and data security willarise, experts predict.andM;Already Bull HN Information Systems Ltd., the Canadian arm of France's GroupeBull has introduced a security system for laptop computers.andM;Called Subrosa, the program is a combination of computer and smart cardtechnology.andP;  Without a smart card, the computer won't produce anyinformation.andM;Toshiba also addressed the security issue last year when it introduced theToshiba SmartDrive by combining a tiny integrated circuit (smart card) readerwith a conventional floppy disk drive.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
