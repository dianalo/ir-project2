About 100 geologically disturbed zones with a total lengthof 26,000 m were encountered at these longwalls in 1984. The area ofdraw roof was 1.2 million m{sup 2}. Technological parameters of fullymechanized longwalls in the Donbass and number of longwalls with particulartypes of geologic instabilities are presented in 2 tables. The lengthof an insecure section (5-15 m) within a longwall increases with smallerangles between longwall and disturbance. At 50% of such sections, drawroof thickness was over 0.6 m. Roofs are consolidated by injection andbolting. Chemical roof bolting is used at over 160 working faces in theDonbass. Chemical roof bolting reduces coal losses and downtime. Annualeconomic effects of chemical roof bolting were estimated to be 41,500rubles per face, and ash content was reduced by 3%. In 1984-1985, chemicalinjection was used at 73 working faces in 27 mines of 9 associations.Six histograms of parameter distribution at places of geologic dislocationsare presented.</TEXT></DOC>
