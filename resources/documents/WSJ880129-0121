This caused several of the committee's senators, like the courtiers in &quot;The Emperor's New Clothes,&quot; to resolutely insist that nothing is amiss with the magnificent new treaty. Republican Senator Dan Evans said the warhead charge was &quot;more than a red herring; I'd call it a crimson whale.&quot; But Senator John Glenn, a Democratic arms-control specialist, was more clear-eyed: &quot;I found an appalling number of people . . . who were not aware that this treaty does not destroy one single nuclear explosive device.&quot;    The administration seems quite confused on the warhead issue. This week Secretary of State George Shultz said the INF agreement could open a new era in arms control because it actually &quot;reduces nuclear weapons.&quot; At this month's Republican debate at Dartmouth College, Vice President Bush had to respond to Pat Robertson's charge that Mr. Bush had said the INF treaty will eliminate 1,600 Soviet warheads. To this, Mr. Bush asserted that the agreement will take out &quot;their vehicles that can blow people up -- their bombs.&quot; The vice president's mistaken comment escaped the front pages only because his media adviser dashed into the pressroom to make the inaccurate claim that the treaty provides for the &quot;dismantling&quot; of Soviet warheads.    In truth, what the INF treaty will mean is that the warheads will be taken off the missiles and saved. Why are Jesse Helms and Pat Robertson able to state clearly what is in the INF treaty, while the vice president and, judging from his rhetoric, the secretary of state cannot?    It is surely true that efforts must be made to limit the wanton destruction nuclear weapons would inflict. That is the stated goal of arms-treaty advocates, but it is also the achievement of recent history. Since World War II, Europe has lived both with nuclear weapons and without war. Moreover, while arms-control treaties have done nothing to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, the desire of strategists to achieve more real military effectiveness has led to improvements in technology that have reduced the destructive arsenals of both the U.S. and Soviet Union.    In 1967, the U.S. had a third more nuclear weapons than it does today. The total explosive power of U.S. nuclear weapons today is one-quarter of the peak reached in 1960. The average warhead yield of U.S. weapons is one-fifteenth its 1957 peak. The Soviets also have seen their total explosive power and average warhead yield decline since the mid-1970s. These gains are the result of technological improvements initiated outside the arms-control process. As the recent presidential commission headed by Fred Ikle and Albert Wohlstetter reports, these gains are likely to continue.    All of this raises the question of what arms-control talks with a dedicated adversary and closed society such as the Soviet Union are supposed to accomplish. Even if the INF treaty did provide for the elimination of nuclear warheads, it still would founder on some basic realities. For one, the best way to dispose of warheads would be to either bury them or burn them in nuclear-power plants. Either would create a verification nightmare.    Many Europeans recognize that the real threat facing their continent is the massive Soviet tank army, not the prospect of nuclear annihilation. The INF treaty obscures the issue of conventional-force modernization, which holds the key to keeping the peace in Europe in the face of a huge and intimidating Soviet-bloc army. This crucially relevant subject will not be seriously addressed or acted on so long as the West's leadership keeps the world in thrall to the arms-control process.    The INF treaty doesn't address the real threat facing Europe, doesn't reduce the number of missiles aimed at the U.S. and doesn't destroy a single nuclear warhead. So what, exactly, is this treaty's relevance or point? What does it accomplish?    Its advocates seem to be reduced to saying that Congress must ratify the INF treaty as the price of admission to the more desirable START talks on strategic-force reductions. So in the end, INF's proponents ask everyone to believe what they've been asked to believe about so many past arms-control treaties -- signing this one will move us one step closer to arriving at real arms reduction, which sits just beyond the horizon. </TEXT></DOC>
