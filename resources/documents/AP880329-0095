Steven Symms, R-Idaho, one of the chief critics of the treatybanning medium-range missiles.   But Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, vice-chairman of theIntelligence Committee, said the charges are ``the same old stuff''which has been considered and rejected by the panel as it endorsedthe treaty last week.   The Soviets have declared that they have 650 SS-20s and allthose missiles will have to be destroyed when the pact takes effect.   But Symms and other critics say the Soviets have up to 350SS-20s more han they have declared, and the critics have said U.S.intelligence estimates of the higher numbers have been hidden.   ``In the opinion of this seantor, the CIA has cooked the numbersof SS-20s and I'm prepared to prove it,'' said Sen. Malcolm Wallop,R-Wyo., another critic of the pact.   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a supporter of the treaty, said,``these arguments have been heard and rejected. I don't expect tohear anything I don't know.''   The Old Senate Chamber where the meeting was held has onlyrarely been used for business meetings since the Senate moved toits present quarters in 1859. It was used this time because theregular Senate chamber is laced with modern broadcasting andelectric cable that could make eavesdropping possible.   It is the first secret Senate meeting since Oct. 7, 1986, andone of six in the past six years.   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said today that theclosed-door meeting was sought by conservatives and he noted thatSenate rules permit such a session at the request of any twosenators.   Supporters of the U.S.-Soviet treaty say the Senate ForeignRelations Committee is likely to approve it by a margin similar tothe 18-2 endorsement given Monday by the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee.   The Foreign Relations panel is scheduled to vote Wednesday onwhether to send the pact to the floor of the full Senate, whereapproval is expected next month.   When the Foreign Relations Committee finally votes, ``I expectthe treaty will be endorsed by a substantial majority,'' said Sen.Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the panel.   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a chief treaty supporter among panelRepublicans, agreed with Pell. ``There is strong bipartisansupport,'' Lugar said.   The only opposition votes in the closed-door Armed Servicesmeeting Monday were cast by Sens. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., andSymms, according to senators who were present.   However, Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said there arestill a number of questions which should be answered about thetreaty.   Nunn told the Foreign Relations Committee that during hispanel's hearings, ``serious concerns were raised that the treatywas unclear on futuristic systems'' and whether they would bebanned by the pact.   Examples of those systems could include laser weapons, particlebeam weapons or other advanced technologies, he said.   Byrd said today that when the treaty reaches the floor, he won'tseek a vote until the issue is resolved. ``I think that's a veryimportant matter that's going to have to be settled,'' he said.   The treaty bans ``weapons delivery vehicles'' with a range of400 to 3,400 miles, Nunn noted, but ``there was disagreement onwhat that meant.''   There has not been any final word from the Reagan administrationon how the United States is defining the term and the ArmedServices Committee thinks it is ``critical'' that the question beanswered, Nunn said. The White House has been asked for a reportproviding that answer, he said.   ``The Senate must be very clear in defining which type offuturistic weapons will be allowed and which will not,'' Nunn said.   Sen. Daniel Quayle, R-Ind., a member of the Armed ServicesCommittee, said the panel thought it was easier to define whatweapons or technologies are covered now, instead of waiting untilthe next decade.   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking Republican on the ArmedServices panel, said he thought the questions can be answeredwithin two or three days.</TEXT></DOC>
