However,there are few steelmakers in the world capable of manufacturing monoblocrotors for high rated turbines, which limits the choice of supplier.Most nuclear turbine rotors have a composite arrangement and are madeeither by shrinking discs on a shaft or using elements welded together.Those in favour of welding have applied a classical socalled &quot;submerged&quot;method using a filler metal. However welding can also be performed byusing an Electron Beam in a vacuum room without a filler metal. Thistechnique has many advantages: mechanical characteristics of the jointare identical to those of the base material after tempering without heataffected zones. Moreover, parts are only very slightly deformed duringwelding. Two steam turbine rotors have been produced in this way. Thispaper described the destructive tests carried out in the four ElectronBeam (EB) welds (two on each rotor).</TEXT></DOC>
