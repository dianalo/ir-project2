(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman who fled New Hampshire with her twoyoung children in November, after a court gave their custody to herex-husband, was found Friday and the children taken from her.   ``I have no idea how they found me,'' Jesse Murabito, 40, saidin a telephone interview after two law officers and a social workerentered the home she rents here and took her 6-year-old daughterand 4-year-old son.   ``The boy started screaming and crying,'' she said, cryingherself. ``He didn't want to leave me. He said, `Momma, don't letthem take me.'''   She said the authorities told her the children would be put in afoster home until a hearing Thursday in Fort Benton in the 12thJudicial District in Chouteau County.   ``They had to carry out my daughter,'' Mrs. Murabito said. ``Ihave no idea where they are. They won't tell me.''   Fort Benton Sheriff Paul Williams, who helped take the childrenfrom their home, said Mrs. Murabito cried and screamed as herchildren were taken away.   ``The kids were crying because their mother was crying,''Williams said. ``She was screaming and yelling and I think thatupset the kids.''   Diann Button, a social worker for the Montana Department ofFamily Services, accompanied sheriff's deputies to Mrs. Murabito'shome in this town of about 80 people on the Missouri River about125 miles northeast of Helena.   Button said the children have been placed in a foster home inthe area, but would not say where. She said she talked to thechildren, but ``they're pretty confused right now.''   Mrs. Murabito, her ex-husband, Mark Russell Murabito, and othersinvolved in the case will be at next week's hearing, the socialworker said.   Raymond Kellett, a lawyer for Mark Murabito, said Friday nightthat this is the first time since November that Murabito has knownwhere his children are. His client will fly to Montana to attendthe hearing, the lawyer said.   ``He's very relieved that the children have been found,''Kellett said. ``Mr. Murabito is very relieved and happy at theprospects of getting the children back.''   Kellett said he contacted Williams on Thursday about thechildren, but would not disclose how he had learned about Mrs.Murabito's whereabouts. Williams said he knew nothing of the caseuntil contacted by Kellett.   The case attracted national attention during the couple'sdivorce proceedings when Mrs. Murabito went to jail for a week inFebruary 1987 rather than tell the court her children's whereabouts.   Murabito, 34, of Derry, N.H., was indicted in March 1988 on acharge of sexually abusing the daughter, but acquitted during atwo-week trial in November.   A Superior Court judge in New Hampshire then stripped her of thechildren's custody, awarded him joint custody with the state. Mrs.Murabito disappeared the same day with the children.   She said she has been living in Loma since April under the nameof Pat Gibeau. Mrs. Murabito said she had a friend living there.Previously, they had stopped in San Francisco and other places, shesaid, but declined to elaborate.   ``I've been trying to protect my children. It's been so hard forme, so hard,'' Mrs. Murabito said.   She said earlier this year during telephone conversations withreporters from undisclosed locations that she had used a nationwide``underground railway'' to flee.</TEXT></DOC>
