That was long before the PC industry became (in the words of thekeynote speaker at last spring's Comdex ) the  greatest wealth generatingmachine ever created by man'.andM;In the decade since Congress last addressed the issue of copyright, littleattention has been paid to writing laws that foster more creativity andinnovation (and protect that innovation) in the unique environment that isthe modern PC industry.andP;  Instead, District Court judges (bottom people on theFederal Court totem pole) are left to write 5-page decisions drawing onprecedents and legal tests of cases long covered in dust.andM;It's about time that legislators both here and across The Pond woke up to thefact that PCs (and the machines that will spring from PC lineage in the nearfuture) will play a big part in shaping society and economies in years tocome.andP;  Bending a 10-year-old law to fit the Lotus user interface is the wrongway to go about managing this dynamic facet of human enterprise.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
