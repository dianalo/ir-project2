A meeting between White House and congressional officials ended yesterday without a firm commitment to an accord, but officials involved in the talks said the final framework for the package could be reached soon, perhaps as early as today.    But enacting the plan through specific spending and tax measures will be difficult, participants added. Even after a deal is struck by the high-level negotiators, individual committees will have to flesh out the often controversial details.    What's more, participants warned, some parts of the package are dubious or unachievable, making the plan's actual savings smaller than its proponents are likely to suggest. One place where the negotiators haven't looked for savings, however, is the politically sensitive Social Security program.    &quot;We are getting very close to an agreement on the first stage of the negotiations,&quot; setting the parameters for spending cuts and tax increases, said House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.).    &quot;Once you get a broad outline, you have to do the details, and the details are hard to come by,&quot; said Sen. Bennett Johnston (D., La.).    Yesterday, the negotiators were on the verge of adopting a final pact, but then began looking more closely at the specific program changes that would be needed to reach the overall dollar figures. It quickly became clear that some of the numbers in the package would be difficult to achieve.    At this point, the negotiators hope to put together a package that contains $31.4 billion in deficit reductions from the current fiscal year's projected deficit of about $180 billion. The savings in the following fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1, would be between $47 billion and $50 billion.    The tax increase this fiscal year would be as much as $10 billion, participants said, and wouldn't be less than $9 billion. The negotiators were leaving the decision on which taxes to raise to congressional tax-writing committees. The new taxes probably will be drawn from the separate tax packages already devised by House and Senate committees, and aren't likely to involve an increase in income-tax rates or the gasoline tax.    The precise amount of the tax increase would depend on the amount of savings that can be obtained from entitlement programs. Currently, the amount of such savings is penciled in at $4 billion, though there is sentiment to raise that to $5 billion. However, negotiators have found only about $3 billion in achievable savings in entitlement programs, which provide benefits under requirements established by law.    The Reagan administration is demanding that tax increases be tied closely to the amount of reductions in projected nonmilitary spending. If the entitlement savings reach $5 billion, the size of the tax increase is likely to reach $10 billion. If the savings are $4 billion, the tax increase would be $9 billion, participants said.    The entitlement-program cuts tentatively agreed to include $900 million through cuts in farm subsidies, specifically reducing target prices, which determine the amount of subsidies. In addition, the Medicare program, which provides health insurance for elderly people, would be pared by $2 billion, although $500 million of that would come from a stretching out of payments to hospitals and doctors, which some budget experts said wouldn't provide savings over the long term.    Military spending would be reduced by between $4.5 billion and $5 billion from a projected level of about $290 billion this fiscal year. Annually appropriated, nonmilitary spending would be reduced by about $2.7 billion from a projected level of less than $200 billion. A large share of that figure would come from a roughly $700 million reduction in foreign aid.    In addition, the negotiators hope to gain $1.6 billion in added revenue by increasing the number of Internal Revenue Service agents and about $1 billion by imposing various user fees.    The negotiators intend to count the refinancing of loans from the Rural Electrification Administration as a gain of $5 billion. But the rules of the revised Gramm-Rudman don't permit the transaction to be counted as a deficit reduction. In any case, budget experts believe such refinancings would lose revenue in the long run.    The result is that in fiscal 1988, the real deficit reduction in the package is precariously close to -- and could end up below -- the $24.8 billion in savings needed to avert the $23 billion across-the-board spending cut that is scheduled to go into effect Nov. 20.    The negotiators hope the plan will extend for at least two years. In the second year, the tax increase would reach about $15 billion, tougher IRS enforcement would add $2.9 billion in revenue, military programs would be cut about $9 billion, Medicare savings would be about $3.2 billion, and the farm-subsidy reduction would be about $1.9 billion. Many of the other figures remain in dispute.    Looking ahead, aides expressed doubt on whether the entire plan could be enacted in all its details by a week from tomorrow, the deadline for the automatic cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law.    Some pointed to a loophole in the law that would give lawmakers the leeway of 10 legislative days to undo the automatic cuts, and substitute a legislated package.    Another option would be to pass a law that would simply postpone the cuts. </TEXT></DOC>
