Walsh isleaving the door open for further criminal charges in theIran-Contra affair following the indictment of Lt. Col. OliverNorth and three others on charges of ``deceitfully exploiting''U.S. weapons sales to Iran.   The 23-count indictment charging that North, former nationalsecurity adviser John Poindexter and two weapons dealers engaged ina criminal conspiracy ``is simply an interim report'' of the grandjury's 14-month investigation, Walsh told reporters.   ``The grand jury is not finished,'' Walsh said Wednesday afterthe panel returned the 101-page indictment against North,Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj.Gen. Richard V. Secord.   Grand jurors will continue to meet because ``they haveuncompleted investigations,'' Walsh said, refusing to say if morecriminal charges would be brought.   The indictment charges that the defendants circumvented astatutory ban on U.S. military aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels``by deceitfully and without legal authorization'' setting up aclandestine private arms supply network.   It also says the four conspired to defraud the government ``bydeceitfully exploiting for their own purposes and corrupting'' theU.S. arms sales to Iran that were approved by President Reagan inan attempt to win release of American hostages in Lebanon.   The U.S. government was cheated out of its rightful proceedsfrom the sale of $30 million dollars worth of weaponry to Iran, theindictment said. The government received only $12.2 million.   All four defendants were charged with conspiracy, theft ofgovernment property and wire fraud, stemming from the diversion ofarms-sale profits to the Contras to Swiss bank accounts controlledby Hakim and Secord.   Together, these charges carry a maximum 25-year sentence andeach of the three counts has a potential fine of $250,000.   The indictment raises the question of whether Reagan will issuepardons to those charged or convicted as a result of theIran-Contra affair. Reagan, who has refused to rule out pardons forhis former aides, ``had no response'' to the latest development inthe scandal, said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   North, who was fired from his White House post in November 1986,was named in 16 counts. He also was charged with obstructingAttorney General Edwin Meese III's Nov. 21-23, 1986, investigationby making false statements and destroying National Security Councildocuments.   Secord and Hakim were additionally charged with conspiring topay North illegal gratuities by agreeing to set up a $200,000 Swissbank account for the Marine officer's family and to pay for theinstallation of a security system at North's home in Great Falls,Va.   North was accused of accepting the security system and pocketing$4,500 of $90,000 in travelers checks he received from a Contraleader to cover expenses of helping the rebels.   The gratuities were offered to ``encourage North to continue inhis position'' at the White House so Secord and Hakim ``wouldcontinue to receive opportunities for substantial revenues andprofits'' from the arms sales, the indictment said.   Secord and North agreed the ``Enterprise'' would keep most ofthe proceeds from the sale of TOW missiles to Iran in February1986, the indictment said.   Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral, also was charged withfour counts of obstructing congressional inquiries and deletingNational Security Council computer records shortly after theIran-Contra affair unraveled in November 1986.   Last week, another of Reagan's former national securityadvisers, Robert C. McFarlane, pleaded guilty to four misdemeanorcharges of withholding information from Congress about the covertaid efforts.   North also was charged with illegally using a tax-exemptfoundation, the National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty,to raise $3.2 million for the Contras.   North, who was fired from the NSC staff in November 1986, toldreporters: ``I did not commit any crime. I intend to fight theallegations of wrongdoing for as long as necessary.''   The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell, 77,an appointee of President Johnson who presided at one of theWatergate trials and ruled in favor of The Washington Post'spublication of the Pentagon papers.   Secord said on ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' that the charges were``crazy.''   ``We're going to defend this case successfully,'' he said.   N. Richard Janis, who represents Hakim, said ``we believestrongly that Mr. Hakim has committed no crimes and that thisindictment is unfair and unwarranted.'' Poindexter's lawyer,Richard Beckler, told The Washington Post that ``we're going tovigorously contest this case.''</TEXT></DOC>
