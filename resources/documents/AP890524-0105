May 19   Medford (Ore.) Mail Tribune on personal savings:   Benjamin Franklin tapped the mood of the nation many years agowhen he coined the phrase, ``A penny saved is a penny earned.''   In those days Americans ... worked hard, saved their money for``rainy days'' and invested carefully in their futures.   Today, Franklin might use a more pessimistic phrase to sum upthe nation's mood, something like, ``Never put off until tomorrowsomething you can buy today.''   The personal U.S. savings rate for the past four years has rununder 5 percent annually. By comparison, the annual rate for Japanis 16.8 percent and West Germany's rate is 12.3 percent. ...   Americans in the 1980s have indeed been living beyond theirmeans, both as individuals and as a nation. ...   (Economists) look for the free-spending Baby Boom generationborn immediately after World War II to become increasingly thriftyin the years ahead. That's because the early Boomers are enteringtheir 40s now and starting to think about growing older and aboutretirement, which should mean they will soon be saving more of whatthey make than is currently the case.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 17   The Record, Hackensack, N.J., on Bush's anti-crime proposal:   President Bush said his administration is considering whether tomake permanent the temporary ban he announced on imported assaultweaons.   More significantly, he rejected advice from his drug czar,William Bennett, to also ban similar weapons that are domesticallyproduced ... (and) account for about 75 percent of thesemiautomatic assault rifles available in the United States.   Many sportsmen are ... perfectly capable of enjoying a day inthe woods without a weapon equipped with a 20-round clip, a flashsuppressor allowing them to shoot unseen at night, a pistol gripallowing a gunman to spray bullets from the hip, and other featuresassociated with semiautomatics   Bush could have barred such features, which are necessary onlyfor soldiers, without in any way restricting the legitimatesemiautomatic weapons that have been used by generations ofsportsmen.   Bush could also have proposed a uniform national waiting periodon firearms purchases, to allow the buyer's background to bechecked for criminal violations. That would have been leadership.   Instead, Bush compromised. He offered a little to those pressingfor stricter controls on assault weapons and a lot to the powerfullobbyist of the NRA (National Rifle Association).</TEXT><TEXT>   May 21   The Commerical Dispatch, Columbus, Miss., on Panama:   Despite its reputation as a toothless talking shop, theOrganization of American States has started a process that, withluck, should lead to the departure of Panama's drug-traffickingdictator, Manuel Antonio Noriega.   At its first emergency session since 1982, the 32-memberhemispheric body condemned Noriega by name for grave abuses andcalled for a ``transfer of power'' in keeping with the will of thePanamanian people.   With its strong tradition of non-intervention ... that was asclose as the OAS could come to demanding that Noriega step down. ...   Optimists will note that the last time the OAS voted that adictator had to go, in June 1979, Anastasio Somoza was out ofNicaragua within months. But Noriega may be a harder case.   By the time the OAS acted, Somoza faced a civil war. He had lostoutside sources of arms, while the rebels were getting weapons fromVenezuela and Panama, among others.   By contrast, no armed opposition exists in Panama. Noriega is sobrutally ruthless that even peaceful protest can be lethal. A casein point is his unleashing of thugs wielding iron bars to savagelybeat the winning candidates of the May 7 presidential election.</TEXT><TEXT>   May 20   Baraboo (Wis.) News-Republic on Panama:   The time has long since passed for America to apply pressure onher allies to support U.S. efforts to have the democratic electionsin Panama recognized by the Panamanian military.   With more than half the world's oil flowing through the PanamaCanal, all countries should be taking an active role in supportingthe true winners of the election.   Former President Reagan's botched attempts to have Gen. ManuelNoriega removed from power prove that pressure from the U.S. aloneis not enough to produce the desired results.   Intervention in the internal politics of another nation isgenerally not a policy to be encouraged.   However, considering the strong-arm tactics of the Noriegaforces, and the importance of the Canal to the Western Hemisphere,some sort of intervention must be considered.   If Noriega refuses to recognize the true winners of the May 7election despite international pressure, then it is time for theU.S. to seriously consider not honoring the contract it signedunder the Carter Administration to return the Canal to Panamanianownership.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
