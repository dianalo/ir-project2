True, perhaps, but when did numbers ever tell the entire story?   In the wake of these corporate convulsions, the business scene isstrewn with questions about ethics and responsibilities, about theproper use of borrowed money, of the role of banks, of the future of``junk'' bonds.   So vast are the considerations that they begin with the ultimatenaivete: What's happening?   In the past five years $375 billion of corporate equities havebeen removed from markets. In the same period, the long-term debt ofnon-financial companies has about doubled to around $2 trillion.   Much of this debt is of unknown quality. That is, the repaymentability of those raising the debt is unproven. If borrowers renege,it will have a severe impact on some of the big lenders, such asbanks and private pension funds.   Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan brings up anotherconsideration. He sees mounting private debt, particularly corporatedebt arising from takeover activity, as limiting the government'soptions in managing the economy.   Congress is concerned too, and it should be, since leveragedbuyouts are subsidized by taxpayers. That is, the interest paymentson such debt are tax deductible. Should Uncle Sam continue toprovide such an incentive?   Have bondholders, whose investments fell sharply, been abused?   The courts will see to that, because some institutional buyers ofcorporate bonds, such as pension funds insurance companies, aresuing. They say they weren't told of management's plan to cheapenexisting bonds with new debt.   But where do those with less clearcut rights turn?   What, for instance, are the rights of employees whose company ispurchased so that it can be broken up, sold off, its local jobseliminated and its productive years ended?   Doesn't the larger community have rights? Should it sit by idlywhile a once viable division is removed from the tax rolls after thetown committed itself to new storm and sanitary sewers based on thedivision's healthy future?   So serious are the potential consequences of buying, selling andsometimes dismembering entire companies, that it seems inevitablethat even more basic considerations will arise, such as the verydefinition of a corporation.   While such fundamental issues caused concern, few were fullyexplored or in most instances even addressed in the chaotic year ofmergers, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and takeovers.   While the entire business of buying and selling companies createsthese issues, they were especially acute in regard to the officersand directors of companies in which insiders sought control throughleveraged buyouts.   It might seem a safe assumption that nobody should know moreabout a company, including its real value, than those whose job itis to run it. If you accept that assumption, however, you areconfronted with a puzzle.   You must, for example, make sense of the attempted managementtakeover of RJR Nabisco Inc. for $75 a share or $17.6 billion. Thatis what management offered, and it was widely heralded as a bonanzafor shareholders.   Quickly, however, a competing offer came from outsiders at $90 ashare, or close to $21 billion. It meant, in effect, thatmanagement's offer was far less than the best. Left on the table, soto speak, were funds equal to the assets of such well known largecompanies as Wang Labs, Firestone or Inland Steel.   The bidding did not stop there, however. It continued until itexceeded $24 billion before management's own board of directors,fulfilling its obligation to protect shareholders, agreed to anoutside group's offer.   Had shareholders accepted management's first offer they wouldhave made perhaps the worst deal in U.S. business history.   Thankful they hadn't accepted the low-ball offer from RJR Nabiscomanagement, many of these shareholders, along with civic-mindedindividuals and institutions, remain concerned about what could havebeen.   Unlike the matter of existing bondholders, who felt they had aclear-cut case for the courts, many of these issues seem to fallinto a judicial and regulatory no-man's land that might requireyears to deal with.   Are activities of corporate management covered by insider tradinglaws? Should they? Who possibly could be more privy to insideinformation than the managers of a company? Possessing it, did theyuse it for their own benefit?   In the past two years a number of insider cases, instances inwhich nonpublic information was used for private financial gain,have been prosecuted. In most instances, the numbers involved``only'' millions, but in leveraged buyouts the numbers are well upin the billions of dollars.   If the Securities and Exchange Commission's insider tradingregulations are applied to leveraged buyouts the consequences couldmake these other insider cases appear piddling.   Question: Do immediate disclosure regulations apply in leveragedbuyouts? Should they?   Consider that in matters involving a potential change in theprice of a stock, management is obligated to disclose informationimmediately. Clearly, leveraged buyouts, which always affect prices,aren't disclosed immediately.   Another nagging question that could become an issue is this: Whatassurance do shareholders have that managers in a leveraged buyouthaven't depressed operations, knowing that improvements can be madelater?   Of all questions generated by the leveraged buyout binge, one _more than any other _ seems likely to be answered on the samedollars-and-cents terms in which the deals were originally proposed.It concerns the junk bonds.   So-called because they symbolize a very high degree ofleveraging, and therefore are theoretically more risky thanwell-rated bonds, junk bonds face their first general test in thenext recession, whenever that comes.   The question: Will the highly leveraged corporations that issuedjunk bonds be able to sustain payments on these bonds if corporateincome is reduced because of a general recession?   Or will these fantastic buyouts become incredible failures thatspread financial ruin?</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
