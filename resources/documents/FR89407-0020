The proposed amendmentwould add certain eligibility requirements for election to Bank directorshippositions as well as for continued service in those positions. Specifically,in order to qualify to become a Bank director and to retain the directorship,a person may not be serving as an officer or director of any member institutionthat fails to meet its minimum regulatory capital requirements or is subjectto certain regulatory action. Likewise, a person who is subject to certainregulatory action in his capacity as director or officer of an insuredinstitution is also precluded from election as a Bank director or fromcontinuing service in such position. Through this proposal, the Board seeksto resolve any appearance of conflicts of interest that may exist whenofficers or directors of institutions not meeting certain regulatory requirementsare elected to positions as directors of the Banks.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before June 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Please send comment letters to the Director, InformationServices Section, Office of the Secretariat, Federal Home Loan Bank Board,1700 G Street NW., Washington, DC 20552.

Statutory and Regulatory Background</ITAG>Pursuant to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (the ``Act''), 12 U.S.C. 1421<T3>et seq., </T3>the Board has broad statutory powers and obligationsto establish and oversee the Federal Home Loan Bank System which presentlyis comprised of twelve District Banks. Those District Banks, in turn, mayand do act as the Board's agents pursuant to the Act, 12 U.S.C. 1437, whichprovides that the Board may authorize officers, employees, agents, or administrativeunits of the Banks to perform a wide variety of Board functions. Pursuantto that authority, the Board has delegated a number of critical supervisoryexamination and regulatory functions to the Banks. At present the Presidentof each Bank is the Principal Supervisory Agent (``PSA'') of the Boardand the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (``FSLIC'') forthat Bank district. 12 CFR 501.11(a). Other Bank employees may act as SupervisoryAgents. Under the Act, the Banks may make advances to their member institutions,filling an essential liquidity role for the thrift industry. 12 U.S.C.1430.Each of the twelve District Banks in turn is managed by a board of no fewerthan fourteen directors, which has as its duty to ``administer the affairsof the [B]ank fairly and impartially and without discrimination in favorof or against any member or nonmember borrower, and shall, subject to theprovisions hereof, extend to each institution authorized to secure advancessuch advances as may be made safely and reasonably with due regard forthe claims and demands of other institutions, and with due regard to themaintenance of adequate credit standing for the Federal Home Loan Bankand its obligations.'' 12 U.S.C. 1427(j). In certain circumstances theBoard may increase the number of directors on the board of a particularBank. 12 U.S.C. 1427(a).The Act itself sets forth several eligibility requirements that must bemet by all directors on the boards of District Banks, including U.S. citizenshipand residence in the district where the Bank is located. 12 U.S.C. 1427(a).Further, a certain number of directors are to be appointed by the Board,and the remaining directors are to be elected by the members of a particularBank. An elective director, who will represent member institutions of astate within a Bank district, must be an officer or director of an institutionlocated in that state. 12 U.S.C. 1427(b). Persons who have served all orpart of three consecutive terms are ineligible for election to a term beginningwithin two years of the expiration of the last term. 12 U.S.C. 1427(d).Beyond these requirements, the Act provides the Board with broad authorityover the selection and continued service of directors to the board of aDistrict Bank. The Act gives the Board express authority ``to prescriberules and regulations as it may deem necessary or appropriate for the nominationsand election of directors of Federal home loan banks * * * .'' 12 U.S.C.1427(d). Moreover, the Act also expressly gives the Board the authorityto ``suspend or remove any director, officer, employee, or agent'' of anyBank upon providing written notice of the cause therefor to the personsuspended or removed and to the Bank. 12 U.S.C. 1437. The Board also hasplenary rulemaking authority ``to adopt, amend, and require the observanceof such rules, regulations, and orders as shall be necessary from timeto time for carrying out the purposes of the provisions'' of the Act. <T3>Id.</T3>Pursuant to these specific and plenary grants of rulemaking authority,12 U.S.C. 1427(d), 1437, the Board has set forth detailed regulations specificallydealing with procedures for the appointment and election of Bank directors.12 CFR 522.20 through 522.28. However, these regulations do not addressthe situation where the appearance of conflicts of interest may arise becauseofficers or directors of institutions not meeting certain regulatory requirementsare elected to positions as directors of the Banks. The Board's concernsin this regard have heightened inasmuch as an increasing number of theBoard's supervisory and regulatory requirements are tied to an institution'scapital position. For example, Congress recently enhanced the Board's authorityto establish minimum capital levels for insured institutions and explicitlyauthorized the Board to treat an institution's failure ``to maintain capitalat or above the minimum level'' as an unsafe or unsound practice. 12 U.S.C.1464(s), 1730(t). Institutions that fail to meet their minimum capitalrequirements are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, which oftentakes the form of requiring PSA approval before the institution may engagein certain activities. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>12 CFR 563.4(c) (permissible levels of brokered deposits);12 CFR 563.13-3(a) (purchase and sale of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporationstock); 12 CFR 563.9-8(c)(2)(iii) (making equity risk investments). Additionally,the Banks' directors have the authority to determine whether to extendadvances to member institutions that may not be meeting their capital requirements.12 U.S.C. 1430.The supervisory and regulatory functions of the Banks are strictly separatedfrom the credit functions by a ``Chinese wall,'' and the role of the Banks'boards of directors is limited to the credit functions. Nevertheless, giventhe extensive authority granted to the directors of the Banks to administerthe Banks' financial resources and the involvement of the Banks generallyin the supervision of individual institutions, there may be potential forthe appearance of conflicts to arise in a Bank director's role with respectto credit decisions or operating policies affecting member institutionsthat are similar to, and may include, his or her own institution, particularlywhere that institution is under heightened regulatory supervision or hasa greater need for advances.Given the appearance of conflicts that may arise when officers or directorsof insured institutions under heightened regulatory scrutiny are electedto the boards of directors of the Banks, the Board has undertaken a reviewof its procedures for the election of Bank System directors. On November3, 1988, the Board published a temporary rule to implement special proceduresto minimize the appearance of conflicts for the 1988 election of Bank directors.53 FR 44394 (November 3, 1988). That temporary rule provided that to beeligible to become a Bank director in the 1988 election, a candidate couldnot have been serving as an officer or director of any member institutionthat did not meet its minimum regulatory capital requirement. 12 CFR 522.26a(October 25, 1988, which expired on December 31, 1988.)Also on November 3, 1988, the Board published an advance notice of proposedrulemaking seeking public comment on how best to address the Board's concernsover the potential for even the appearance of conflicts of interest thatmay adversely effect the public's perception of the Bank System's regulatoryprocess. 53 FR 44 437 (November 3, 1988) (``Election of Directors of theFederal Home Loan Banks''). The comment period closed on December 5, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="85">B. Discussion of Comments Submitted In Response To Advance NoticeOf Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>The Board received and considered 13 comments in response to the advancednotice of proposed rulemaking, including comments received after the deadline.Twelve of those comments were submitted by thrift institutions; one commentwas submitted by a thrift industry trade group.In its November 3, 1988, advance notice of proposed rulemaking, the Boardsought comments addressing a number of specific inquiries including: (1)Whether it is appropriate for an officer or director of an insured institutionnot meeting its minimum capital requirement to be eligible for electionto a Bank directorship; (2) whether insolvency rather than failure to meetcapital requirements should be a criterion for determining eligibility;(3) whether a Bank director should continue service in that role if hisinstitution falls below its minimum capital requirement or becomes insolventduring the director's term; (4) whether a person against whom a cease anddesist order is outstanding should be precluded from election to the directorateof a Bank; (5) whether it is appropriate for an officer or director ofan insured institution operating under a cease and desist order or underheightened regulatory supervision to be eligible for election to a Bankdirectorship; (6) whether a Bank director who becomes ineligible duringhis or her term due to the operation of a cease and desist order or otherabove-mentioned reason should be automatically removed; and (7) whetherthe same standards for continued service should be applied to existingBank directors. 1. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements Nine commenters urged that the Board adopt the position that an officeror director of an insured institution not meeting its minimum capital requirementsbe ineligible for election to a Bank directorship. The commenters statedthat such action was necessary to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest.Another commenter suggested the modification that officers or directorsof capital deficient thrifts should be permitted to serve as Bank directorsprovided that their organizations have a total regulatory capital of atleast 1.5% and are no more than 200 basis points below their minimum benchmarks.The commenter claimed that this distinction would avoid disqualifying representativesfrom institutions that have moderate capital impairment but would assureelimination of persons likely to be totally preoccupied with the financialproblems of their employers. Another commenter suggested that failure tomeet minimum capital requirements should be only one factor in determininga director's eligibility for election to a Bank directorship position.One commenter opposed the proposed change to eligibility requirements forBank directors based on an insured institution's failure to meet capitalrequirements based on his belief that the interests in equitable representationof those that would be excluded from serving as directors of the Banksoutweighed the Board's interest in avoiding any appearance of conflictof interest. The commenter also expressed the opinion that disenfranchisementof financial institutions that have had the misfortune to become victimsof regional economic disasters beyond their control was inequitable. 2. Insolvency Nine commenters also expressed support for the proposition that officersor directors of insolvent institutions should be ineligible for electionto Bank directorships, inasmuch as a director in such a situation wouldbe presented with a significant distraction from proper attention to aBank's affairs. One commenter opposed any change to eligibility requirementsfor Bank directors based on the insolvency of an officer's or director'sown institution, given the allegedly changeable status of insolvent institutions.As an alternative to outright denial of membership on the Banks' boards,the commenter proposed that those boards themselves determine whether thecircumstances of each individual case warranted dismissal of an insolventmember. One commenter stated without elaboration that insolvency ratherthan failure to meet capital requirements should be the criterion for determiningeligibility for election of Bank directors. 3. Continued service after failure to meet capital requirements Eight commenters supported the proposal that a Bank director should notcontinue to serve in that role if this institution falls below its minimumcapital requirement or becomes insolvent during the director's term. Onecommenter explicitly stated that making removal decisions on a case-by-casebasis would itself raise conflict of interest concerns and would proveburdensome absent clear eligibility requirements. Three commenters opposedremoval of a director serving on a Bank board if his institution fell belowits minimum capital requirement or became insolvent during his term. Oneof those commenters, however, urged that a director in such circumstancesshould not be eligible to seek re-election. Another of those commentersproposed that because failure to meet minimum capital requirements arguablymay be a temporary situation, a director should not immediately be removedbut rather should only be barred from voting when his own institution feelbelow its minimum capital requirement, unless that failure exceeded a certainspecified period of time. 4. Outstanding cease and desist order against an individual Eleven commenters urged adoption of the requirement that a person againstwhom a cease and desist order is outstanding be precluded from electionto the directorate of a Bank. One commenter proposed as an alternativethat the District Bank's board should review the individual circumstancesof each case where a board member or potential board member had a ceaseand desist order outstanding against him and determine whether dismissalwas warranted. 5. Outstanding cease and desist order against the institution Nine commenters agreed that it would be inappropriate for an officer ordirector of an insured institution operating under a cease and desist orderto be eligible for election to a Bank directorship. One commenter, however,proposed an alternative two-tiered approach whereby an officer or directorof an institution against which a cease and desist order was outstandingwho was serving in that capacity at the time the conduct in question occurredwould not be allowed to be a Bank director, but an officer or directorwho arrived at the institution after the conduct in question occurred wouldbe eligible for service as a director upon expiration of two years afterissuance of the order. The commenter further proposed that the Board makethe eligibility of specific persons for Bank directorship positions a topicfor negotiation in connection with the issuance of a consent cease anddesist order. The commenter reasoned that given the great diversity incircumstances surrounding cease and desist orders, a case-by-case evaluationof the necessity of barring particular individuals from holding Bank directorshipswas more equitable. With regard to the proposal to exclude directors of institutions operatingunder other forms of heightened regulatory supervision such as supervisoryagreements from eligibility for election to Bank directorships, four commentersgenerally supported such an exclusion. Those commenters urged that sucha ban should exclude from election to Bank directorship positions thoseofficers and directors from institutions that are continually having tobe reprimanded by their PSA, that are subject to other regulatory concerns,or that could otherwise be characterized as troubled thrifts. 6. Continued service in face of cease and desist order Seven commenters supported the automatic removal of a director from a Bankboard where a cease and desist order is issued either against him or hisinstitution during his term of service. One commenter proposed that a ceaseand desist order should be grounds for removing a sitting director afterthe expiration of ninety days from the date of that order. The commenterexplained that the ninety day period would give the sitting director theopportunity to answer the charges and correct any deficiencies under whichthe order was issued. The commenter proposed further that if the problemsof the institution had not been resolved so as to permit cancellation ofthe cease and desist order after the ninety day period, the director couldbe removed, but only after a hearing before the Board. The commenter statedthat where the director could show that the cease and desist order wasbased on conduct over which he had no control or which was not his fault,then the Board should permit continued service. 7. Applicability of eligibility standards to sitting District Bank directorsNone of the commenters explicitly addressed the Board's seventh inquiryas to whether the same standards should be automatically applied to existingdirectors who began their service prior to the effective date of a finalregulation addressing eligibility for continued service based on the appearanceof conflict, or whether decisions regarding directors currently servingshould be made on a case-by-case basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Board Consideration of Issues</ITAG>Based upon a thorough review of the comments submitted in response to theadvance notice of proposed rulemaking, as well as upon consideration ofother policy concerns, the Board proposes to amend its regulations governingelection of directors of the Banks and to publish those proposed amendmentsfor comment.As already indicated, the Board's current regulations do not limit theeligibility of officers or directors of insured institutions under heightenedregulatory scrutiny to be elected to Bank directorships. 12 CFR 522.20through 522.28. The Board believes, however, that it may be inappropriatefor personnel from institutions that have been the subject of heightenedregulatory concern and scrutiny to then serve on the boards of the Bankswhich play such an integral role in the Board's regulation and supervisionof the entire thrift industry. For example, where a Bank director alsoserves as an officer with an institution that is the subject of heightenedregulatory concern, there may be a tension between that person's responsibilitiesto the Bank System at large, and the specific business needs of his institution.In particular, the Banks' directors have the authority to determine whetherto extend advances to member institutions which may not be meeting theircapital requirements. Should a director's own institution, or a similarlysituated institution, apply for such an advance from the Bank where heor she sits as a director, obviously an appearance of conflict arises.In such situations, the person's role as a Bank director deciding whetherto extend the advance based on the interests of the Bank system as a wholeappears to conflict with his or her role as a director or officer of atroubled thrift seeking to protect the interests of that particular institution.Moreover, even though a director may usually recuse himself from the actualdecision making process when his own institution requests an advance, theappearance of conflict is not necessarily resolved inasmuch as a questionas to whether he had any indirect influence on the decision may still linger.Moreover, as required by the Act, special sensitivity must be used by adirector in administering the affairs of the Bank fairly and impartiallyand without discrimination in favor of or against any member. 12 U.S.C.1427(j). Here again the troubled financial condition of a director's institutionmight appear to affect the impartial judgment of a director as it pertainsto matters affecting institutions that may be competing with the director'sown institution. Avoidance of even the appearance of such conflicts isnecessary to protect fully the overall integrity of the Federal Home LoanBank System.Finally, the troubled condition of a potential director's institution mightbe unduly imputed to the financial state of a District Bank or the FederalHome Loan Bank System. Even the existence of such an incorrect belief wouldrun counter to the Board's obligation to protect to the utmost the overallintegrity of the Bank System. It is important that all the District Banksin the Federal Home Loan Bank System maintain the confidence they currentlyenjoy in the financial community as well as with the public at large.In order to avoid any potential for the appearance of these conflicts ofinterest as between the various responsibilities and loyalties of Bankdirectors, the Board is proposing to limit eligibility for election toand continued service in a Bank directorship position. The Board takesthis action pursuant to its broad statutory powers and obligations to establishand oversee the Federal Home Loan Bank System including its express responsibilityfor overseeing the election and appointment of directors to the boardsof the district Banks. 12 U.S.C. 1427, 1437.The Board is proposing a new andSection; 522.29, which will operate in conjunctionwith the Board's existing rules administering the Bank System elections.<T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 522.25 through 522.26. Sections 522.29(b)(1)(i), (c)(1)(i),and (d)(1)(i) propose that an officer or director of a member institutionthat is not meeting its minimum capital requirements pursuant to 12 CFR563.13 or 563.14 is ineligible for election to a Bank directorship. Themajority of commenters supported a change of this nature as necessary tohelp prevent potential conflicts of interest, or even the appearance ofsuch conflicts that may adversely affect other specific measures beingtaken to reinforce the ongoing integrity of the Bank System. Although onecommenter proposed a new measure of regulatory capital to be applied forpurposes of this regulation, the Board believes that the regulatory capitalrequirement has already been adequately defined at 12 CFR 563.13 and thatdefinition, and any individual capital requirement imposed on an institutionpursuant to 12 CFR 563.14, should be used in newly proposed andSection; 522.29.The Board also believes that failure to meet capital requirements ratherthan insolvency is the appropriate criterion for determining eligibilityfor election to District Bank directorships, because the former requirementprovides a higher standard for member institutions to meet. Insolvencyis itself grounds for finding an institution in default and may triggera number of regulatory or enforcement measures including closure. 12 U.S.C.1464(d)(6)(A). The Board does not believe it should wait until an institutionreaches such a seriously unsound financial condition before precludingthat institution's directors from serving on the board of a District Bank.Allowing officers or directors of member institutions to continue to beeligible for election because their own institutions still meet the bareminimum standard of insolvency but have long since failed to meet capitalrequirements simply would not eliminate the appearance of conflict createdwhen officers or directors from troubled institutions serve as DistrictBank directors. Moreover, to use both criteria would be duplicative, inasmuchas an insolvent institution by definition has also failed to meet its minimumregulatory capital requirement. 12 CFR 563.13.In response to one commenter's concern about the inequity of ``disenfranchising''a financial institution that has been the victim of a regional economicdisaster beyond its control, the Board considered whether officers or directorsof institutions qualifying for the capital forbearance program should beeligible for election to District Bank directorships. 12 U.S.C. 1467a,12 CFR 563.47. Pursuant to that program, a troubled but well-managed institutionlocated in an economically depressed region will not be subject to supervisoryor enforcement action to enforce its minimum capital requirement so longas the institution is taking the required remedial steps to achieve itsrequired level of regulatory capital. <T3>Id.</T3> The Board, however, has rejected this alternative inasmuchas an institution in the capital forbearance program remains in a weakenedcapital position, and directors from such an institution may be perceivedto have a conflict of interest if they were to serve on the board of aDistrict Bank that may be required to make decisions concerning advancesor other issues that would affect that troubled institution or its competitors.Sections 522.29 (b)(1)(ii), (c)(1)(ii), and (d)(1)(ii) propose that directorsand officers of any member that is operating under a cease and desist orderare ineligible for election to a Bank directorship. In response to onecommenter's suggestion for a complicated two-tiered approach based on whenthe conduct in issue occurred, the Board believes that such a procedureis not only to burdensome but fails to serve the purpose of the proposedrule. Regardless of whether a director's service with the member institutioncoincides with the conduct which is the subject of the order, an appearanceof conflict may still be raised when that director is elected to the boardof a District Bank at the same time as his own institution is the subjectof heightened supervision by the PSA of the Bank. Moreover, as discussedabove, the troubled condition of the director's institution might actuallyor apparently affect the impartial judgment of the director as it pertainsto matters affecting institutions that may be competing with the director'sown institution. Avoidance of even the appearance of such conflicts isnecessary to protect the integrity of the Bank system, and the Board believesthe proposed rule achieves that goal by precluding directors and officersof member institutions against which cease and desist orders have issuedfrom eligibility for directorship elections regardless of the circumstancessurrounding those orders.For similar reasons, the Board also has proposed in section 522.29 (b)(1)(iii),(c)(1)(iii), and (d)(1)(iii) that directors and officers of any memberthat is operating under a supervisory agreement are ineligible for electionto a Bank directorship.Sections 522.29 (b)(2), (c)(2) and (d)(2) propose that any officer or directoragainst whom a cease and desist order or supervisory agreement is outstanding,or against whom a notice of intention to remove and prohibit has been issuedpursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1730(g), should be precluded from election to thedirectorate of any Bank. Given the serious nature of the issues invariablyinvolved in such proceedings or orders, the Board believes that it is inappropriatefor individuals who are the subject of such proceedings or orders to beeligible for election to the directorate of a Bank that constitutes suchan integral part of the Board's supervision and regulation of the thriftindustry.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Of course, any director or officer against whom a removaland prohibition order is outstanding is not eligible for election as adirector of a District Bank, because he is barred from any further participationin a FSLIC-insured institution. 12 U.S.C. 1464(d)(4), 1730(g).Section 522.29(e)(1)(i) proposes that a Bank director is ineligible tocontinue service and will be removed with notice from the position by theBoard, or its designee, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1437(a), if his institutionfalls below its minimum capital requirement, established pursuant to andSection;563.13 or andSection; 563.14, during the director's term. The board believesthat even a brief failure to meet minimum capital requirements reflectsupon the financial condition of a member institution and raises the potentialfor at least the appearance of a conflict of interest on the part of thedirector or officer of that member in his role as a District Bank director.The Board agrees with at least one commenter that to have the DistrictBank's board make removal decisions on a case-by-case basis would itselfraise conflict of interest concerns and would prove burdensome absent cleareligibility requirements. Case-by-case review may also pose problems regardingmaintaining the confidentiality of financial information among competingfinancial institutions. The Board also notes that simply barring a directorfrom the actual voting process in this situation, as suggested by one commenter,fails to eliminate the appearance of conflict inasmuch as a question asto whether that director had any indirect influence on the board's decisionmaking process may still linger. Furthermore such an alternative mightcreate a situation where a District Bank board had a limited number ofvoting members, but the Board would be precluded from appointing any newdirectors because none of the nonvoting District Bank board directors wouldhave resigned. The presence of nonvoting members on a District Bank's boardfor significant periods of time would defeat the intent of the Act, 12U.S.C. 1427, that there be a specified number of voting directors to representthe interests of the Bank's members.Section 522.29(e)(1)(ii) proposes that directors and officers of any memberagainst which a cease and desist order is issued and who are serving termsas directors of any Bank at the time such order issues will not be eligibleto continue to serve as District Bank directors and will be removed withnotice by the Board, or its designee, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1437(a). Althougha cease and desist order may not carry any negative implications aboutan individual's capacity to serve as a Bank director, the Board believesthat the appearance of conflict in that situation carries with it the potentialfor injury to the integrity of the Bank System significant enough to constitutecause for removing that individual from service as a Bank director. Asin the case of institutions not meeting their minimum capital requirements,institutions operating under cease and desist orders are under close regulatoryscrutiny by the Board and the Banks as agents of the Board. To allow adirector to continue to serve on a Bank's board while his own institutionis undergoing heightened regulatory scrutiny clearly raises the potentialfor an appearance of conflict regardless of whether the director's ownconduct has been implicated in the cease and desist order. Again, as discussedabove, a case-by-case review in these circumstances would not only be burdensome,but would only enhance the potential for conflict of interest among Bankdirectors and raise confidentiality of information problems.Similar concerns arise when an insured institution enters into a supervisoryagreement. Accordingly andSection; 522.29(e)(1)(ii) also proposes that directorsand officers of any member against which a supervisory agreement issuesand who are serving terms as directors of any Bank at the time such agreementissues will be ineligible to continue to serve as a District Bank directorand will be removed with notice by the Board, or its designee, pursuantto 12 U.S.C. 1437(a).Section 522.29(e)(2) proposes that any person against whom a notice ofintention to remove and prohibit is issued, or against whom a cease anddesist order is issued, or with whom a supervisory agreement is enteredinto, and who is serving a term as a Bank director at the time of suchoccurrence will be ineligible to continue to serve as a District Bank directorand will be removed with notice by the Board, or its designee, pursuantto 12 U.S.C. 1437(a). The Board believes that one commenter's suggestionfor board review of the individual circumstances of each case is inconsistentwith the purposes of the proposed rule; the very existence of one of theseorders or agreements against the director raises a significant likelihoodof an actual or apparent conflict for the individual between his role asa Bank director seeking to protect the integrity of the Federal Home LoanBank System and his role as an officer or director of a troubled institutionthat has been determined to need heightened regulatory supervision. Moreover,a case-by-case review in these circumstances would itself raise conflictof interest concerns with regard to Bank directors involved in the reviewand could pose problems with regard to maintaining the confidentialityof financial information among competing financial institutions.The Board also believes that due process does not require that DistrictBank directors be afforded a hearing before or after their removal. TheBoard has statutory power to remove a District Bank director simply bynotifying him and his District Bank in writing of the cause of such removal.12 U.S.C. 1437(a).\2\<NOTE/> Inasmuch as District Bank directors assume their positionswith the understanding that they can be terminated by the Board simplywith notice, they have no due process entitlement to additional proceduresbeyond those Congress has already statutorily provided in 12 U.S.C. 1437(a).<T3>Board of Regents </T3>v. <T3>Roth</T3>, 408 U.S. 564 (1972); <T3>cf. McCauley </T3>v. <T3>Thygerson</T3>, 732 F.2d 978, 982 (D.C. Cir. 1984); <T3>Inglis</T3> v. <T3>Feinerman</T3>, 701 F.2d 97 (9th Cir. 1983), <T3>cert. denied</T3>, 464 U.S. 1040 (1984). However, the Board invitescomments on the due process issue.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The courts have also recognized that the supervisory roleof the Board over the Banks supersedes the corporate rights which the Actgrants a Bank's directors and shareholders. <T3>Fahey</T3> v. <T3>O'Melveny andamp; Myers</T3>, 200 F.2d 420 (9th Cir. 1952) <T3>cert. denied sub. nom. willhoit </T3>v. <T3>Fahey, </T3>354 U.S. 952 (1953).The Board believes that it is appropriate for the proposed regulationsdescribed above and set forth below to be applied to existing Bank directorswho began serving in that position prior to the final enactment of regulationsaddressing eligibility requirements for continued service based on theappearance of a conflict. The Board's view is that similar concerns forthe appearance of conflict may arise with respect to directors currentlyserving on a District Bank's board and therefore the regulation shouldprovide a similar standard. However, the Board solicits comments on alternativesto this approach.That the Board has specified in its proposed regulation certain circumstancesunder which it will exercise its removal powers pursuant to section 17of the FHLBank Act, 12 U.S.C. 1437, when a director no longer meets certaineligibility requirements, in no way indicates that the Board is in anyway limiting its full statutory authority to remove a director for reasonsnot listed, but merely provides notice of circumstances where such authoritygenerally will be exercised.Although regulations involving the management and directors of the Banksare matters of internal organization, practice, and procedure of the FederalHome Loan Bank System, and public notice and comment is therefore not requiredby the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 <T3>et seq</T3>., the Board is today seeking comment from the public onthese issues in order to assist in determining the appropriate avenue toaddress these concerns.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603 (1982),the Board is providing the following initial regulatory flexibility analysis:1.
