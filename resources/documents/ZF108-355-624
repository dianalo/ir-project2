(discussion of factors to consider inimplementing faster communications links)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Weiss, Jeffrey.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Selection of a higher speed physical communications environment,typically fiber optic or microwave, for data/voice networkingrequires assessment of several factors.andP;  The primary reasons forinstalling such a system include the need for higher transmissionperformance than that offered by telephone companies and thereduction of long-term operating costs.andP;  Factors to be consideredin implementing new communications links include type of service(10M-bit/sec over dedicated links or T1 1.5M-bit/sec or T26.3M-bit/sec over non-dedicated links), availability of T2circuits through central-office direct-access connect switches,bridge performance, filtering and packet size requirements ofparticular applications, distance between facilities to be linkedand security requirements.andP;  Microwave is the best choice for nodesthousands of feet to 100 miles apart.andP;  Fiber optics offer superiorsecurity.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     System SelectionHardware SelectionCriteriaMicrowave CommunicationsFiber OpticsOptical CommunicationsComparisonPerformance ImprovementPerformance-Cost RelationshipCommunications Circuits.andO;Feature:   illustrationtable.andO;Caption:   Time to transfer 640Kbyte load at different transmission rates.andO;(table)andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
