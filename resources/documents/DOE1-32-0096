Unlikethe conventional vertical bed, a centrifugal bed is predicted to be fluidizedlayer by layer from the inner free surface outward, in a range of aerationrates. The span of this range increases with the depth of the particlebed. The pressure drop is predicted to exhibit a plateau, which agreesvery well with the observations of many investigators, but disagreeswith the investigations of others, in which the pressure drop exhibiteda maximum.</TEXT></DOC>
