It would be the first sale of two-engine, 500-mile range F-18sto an Arab country, but State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakleysaid, ``Kuwait obviously faces a threat in the gulf.''   ``We've said over and over again that views of Congress willplay a large part in our consideration of this question, but westress again the threat in the gulf region is clear and we thinkthe Kuwaiti request is consistent with our policy,'' she said.   The administration notified Congress several months ago that itexpected Kuwait to make a request for advanced aircraft to replaceaging, A4 attack planes vulnerable to equipment being used by bothIran and Iraq in their seven-year-old war.   Of the possible replacements, Kuwait picked the McDonnellDouglas Co's F-18, the newest of the choices and a plane sold onlyto treaty allies, Spain, Australia and Canada.   Kuwait apparently picked the plane because it was built for theU.S. Navy for operations over water and can be converted withinminutes from an air-to-air fighter to a well-stocked bomber.   Of the other possibilities, McDonnell Douglas's F-15 isconsidered purely an air-to-air combat plane and General Dynamics'F-16 has less versatility than the F-18 in performing bombing andfighter missions with equal effectiveness.   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theadministration is consulting with Congress to determine if approvalwould be granted for the sale of all 40 F-18s Kuwait wants. Inaddition, the administration wants to see if Congress would resistselling F-18s to Kuwait, but would accept the transfer of F-16s.   Congress has already permitted F-16 sales to Egypt and Bahrain,another small oil-producing state.   Arms sales to the Middle East are closely scrutinized on CapitolHill, where there is concern about giving sophisticated weapons toArab nations still technically in a state of war with Israel. Sen.John Kerry, D-Mass., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee,raised another concern: the level of weaponry in the war-torn gulfregion.   ``The administration keeps trying to escalate the level ofsophistication when there is already an escalation of modernweapons in the region,'' Kerry said. He cited the sale oflong-range Chinese missiles to Saudi Arabia as an example.   ``The F-18, that's our most sophisticated, latest technology,''Kerry said. ``I'm concerned about it. I just don't see a need forit at first blush.''   Kuwaiti interest in the F-18s was disclosed during congressionaltestimony earlier this week by Richard W. Murphy, assistantsecretary of state for Near Eastern affairs.   The United States and Kuwait have created an increasingly closesecurity relationship since last year, when the United Statescommitted naval forces to protect U.S.-flagged ships travelingthrough the Persian Gulf.   Individual F-18s as supplied to the U.S. Navy by McDonnellDouglas Co. cost $17 million, making the Kuwaiti sale a potential$680 million deal.   With a range of 500 nautical miles, Kuwaiti-based F-18 jetscould hit targets throughout most of the Persian Gulf and deep inIranian territory.   Mrs. Oakley, the State Department spokeswoman, said, meanwhile,a request by another gulf state, Oman, for U.S. shoulder-firedStinger anti-aircraft missiles ``reflects legitimate defenserequirements.''   She noted Congress has prohibited such sales to all Persian Gulfcountries during the fiscal year that runs through Sept. 30, butshe added, ``no decisions on future actions have been taken.''   The U.S. ambassador to Oman, G. Cranwell Montgomery, said he istrying to get Congress to change its mind, but Sen. DennisDeConcini, D-Ariz., sponsor of the Stinger sale ban, said he wouldoppose the effort.   DeConcini has expressed concern that the light, portableStingers could be diverted from Middle Eastern nations to terroristgroups and used against civilian aircraft.</TEXT></DOC>
