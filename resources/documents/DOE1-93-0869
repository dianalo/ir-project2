<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-93-0869 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new ECIS code is under study. It includes all the improvements whichseemed to be necessary, including P. Moldauer's work on compound nucleus.Dirac formalism, used since some years to study elastic scattering wasgeneralized to inelastic scattering. Besides the scalar and the vectorpotential, this formalism uses a tensor potential including a long rangeCoulomb contribution even for neutron scattering. Dirac equation canbe written as a Schroedinger equation which is fully equivalent onlyfor elastic scattering. Coupled Dirac or Schroedinger equations can besolved by iterations. Comparison of their results justifies the use ofdeformed spin-orbit potentials.</TEXT></DOC>
