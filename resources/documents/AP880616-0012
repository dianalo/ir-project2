Mother Teresa, 77, works with and is the founder of theinternational Missionaries of Charity, a religious order inCalcutta. She received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her workto ease the suffering of dying slum dwellers, and is known there asthe ``saint of the gutters.''   The small, frail-looking woman, wearing a white cotton shawl andblue-trimmed robe, spoke fiercely against ``the evil of abortion,of destroying children, of neglecting children.''   ``We're fighting abortion by adoption, and we have savedthousands of children from being destroyed, because as you knowabortion has become the greatest destroyer of peace because itdestroys the child, the gift of God. And it destroys the conscienceof the mother, it is actually a double killing.''   When asked if she discussed with Perez de Cuellar the U.N.population control programs, she said she had not. Manyanti-abortion activists have criticized the programs, saying thempromote abortion as a possible option.   ``I think we talked of other things, that we didn't say,'' shereplied.   Another reporter asked her why the concept of non-violence doesnot seem to work in South Africa, where Mohandas K. Gandhi livedfor 21 years and where Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the 1984Nobel Peace Prize winner, carries on the tradition of peacefulcivil disobedience today.   Mother Teresa said ``non-violence begins at home,'' adding,``Our government in India and the government of South Africa havegiven us full permission to go to South Africa. And we have amixture of all nationalities, and I am going to take take with medifferent nationalities, different colors, and bring there with methe joy of loving.''   She said she was in New York to try to open a center to care forchildren infected with AIDS.</TEXT></DOC>
