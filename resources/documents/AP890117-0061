Carter helped put up the four-townhouse complex in 1986 throughhis association with Habitat for Humanity, a non-profit Christianorganization based in Americus, Ga., that builds and rehabilitateshouses for the homeless nationwide.   Tenants, who help construct the buildings, are selected by aHabitat screening committee.   In Chicago, tenants are complaining of verbal abuse, poorconstruction and unanswered pleas for help.   Habitat officials say the tenants aren't meeting theirobligations.   A family of eight was evicted earlier this month for not payingrent, the second eviction in nine months at the four-unit complex.   ``None of us can believe what is happening,'' said Arbie Nelson,a mother of seven who owes $1,000 in rent and is fighting in courtto avoid seeing her family become the third evicted.   Habitat can't be expected to pick up the tab, said Patrick Keen,an official with a Habitat chapter in Chicago.   ``It's painful that we have to take these kinds of actionsagainst families, because it's contrary to everything we stand forin trying to reform these people,'' Keen said. ``But everyone thatclaims to need help doesn't deserve help, and people who are notliving up to the very basic obligation of the minimal amountexpected of them _ well, we had no other choice.''   Several families were threatened with eviction in July 1987 afterfalling behind in their rent. They said heating and maintenanceproblems led to huge utility bills and other problems.   Habitat founder Millard Fuller and the group's West Side chapterreached an agreement with the families, reducing rents from $300 to$264 and promising to correct the problems.   Keen said the group had no choice but to begin evictions whentenants continued to withhold rent.   The latest to lose their apartment were Vivian and Marvin Abramsand their eight children.   Mrs. Abrams said she returned home earlier this month to find herchildren huddled outside in the cold and the family's possessionsstrewn along the curb.   The family owed $1,300 in rent, but Mrs. Abrams said she hadwithheld some payments to protest unfinished work on the building.   She said she had just found a job when sheriff's deputies arrivedwith the eviction notice.   ``We helped build that house, my 14-year-old and I,'' she said.``When I heard what was happening, I rushed home with my new boss,and we begged and pleaded with Mr. Keen.   ``My boss pledged to pay whatever Keen wanted, and the sheriffsaid it was up to Mr. Keen, but Patrick Keen said `No,''' Mrs.Abrams said.   Keen said he was told by Habitat officials in Chicago to throwthe family out.   ``There was an error made in evicting that family,'' Fuller saidMonday. ``People are going to think Habitat is a heartlessorganization that throws mothers and children out in the street inthe dead of winter. That is not the case. This is the first timeanybody has been evicted.''   Fuller said the group's regional director will be directed to``fully investigate just what the situation is in Chicago, so we canrectify it.''   ``We are aware that West Side Habitat has had rental problemswith these families,'' Fuller said. But ``two wrongs don't make aright.''   Fuller said that of 324 cities in which Habitat operates, ``Wehave had more trouble in Chicago than any other city. Only New Yorkhas had similar problems.''</TEXT></DOC>
