(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The last of five cloistered RomanCatholic nuns has left her monastery after spending nine monthsbarricaded in the infirmary to protest liberal changes.   Sister Teresita, who with four others locked herself in the roomon Oct. 4, left the Carmelite monastery Thursday, leaving no word onher destination, said Tim Manning, a spokesman for the diocese ofPaterson.   ``She indicated to another sister that she was going to a safeplace and would be in touch with Mother Theresa Hewitt,'' themonastery's prioress, Manning said.   Last Friday, three other nuns ended their self-imposed exile,leaving only Sister Teresita in the infirmary. The three left withan Akron, N.Y., priest, according to laywoman Betty Sutton, aspokeswoman for the rebellious nuns.   Neither Ms. Sutton nor Manning knew if Sister Teresita was tojoin the other three nuns or how to reach them, they said.   The five nuns began their protest quietly last October at themonastery about 25 miles from New York City but soon foundthemselves in a bitter struggle with Paterson Bishop Frank Rodimerand their prioress.   Reached by The Associated Press in March, Sister John of theCross, one of the five, said the group objected to reformsinstituted by the newly appointed prioress. They included suchthings as candy, television and popular music that she saiddetracted from the prayerful atmosphere intended by the founders ofthe Carmelite order.   The five held out through threatened evictions by Rodimer, hopingtheir appeal to the Vatican would overrule the bishop's order toleave the monastery. But in February, the Vatican affirmed Rodimer'sauthority and the bishop ordered the nuns to leave.   The first of the five protesting nuns left the monastery inMarch, because of health problems.</TEXT></DOC>
