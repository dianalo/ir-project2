The project phase I (1982 - June 30, 1985) is aboutto be concluded at the time this report is published. The main pointsof interest of this project phase cover the planning of the experimentalwork, the design of experiments, and the first activities for developingthe systems for handling the high-level radioactive wastes. The engineeringdevelopment work has been advanced to the point where construction andmanufacture of equipment can be started (transport containers Asse, TB1,collective transport containers, borehole gates, transport vehicles,waste positioning equipment, and borehole casing). Testing of the pipesfor the last mentioned task with regard to the material's deformationbehaviour will be done by the Dutch ECN as a sub-contractor. First laboratoryexperiments have been carried out on radiolysis gas formation, to complementthe engineering work and the in-situ measuring programmes.</TEXT></DOC>
