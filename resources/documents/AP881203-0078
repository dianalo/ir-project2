Many of his friends and fellow boatmen disappeared in the stormTuesday night, but Biswas survived and gave thanks that Shanti, too,was safe.   A few days later, he headed for the place where Shanti had gone,two miles further inland. On the way, he stumbled upon a child'sbody on the bank of the Pasur River, one of the more than 1,400people who perished when the cyclone struck Bangladesh and India.   Drawing closer, he peered in disbelief at the bloated,decomposing body. Then he screamed, beat his chest and cried,``Shanti, my little doll, Shanti.''   Biswas, incoherent with grief, could barely relate his story.Most of it was told by a volunteer from the Red Crescent Society,the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross, who was with the boatmanwhen he found his daughter's body.   Ram Chandra, the village elder, said Biswas' wife died a year agoof cholera and Shanti was his only child.   Chandra said six people died in Shoron Khola when the cyclonestruck, leveling most of the straw-and-mud houses in the village of160 people. But he said many people, perhaps dozens, had set out intheir boats to try to escape the cyclone bearing down upon ShoronKhola, which is barely a mile from the Bay of Bengal.   ``Those who stayed back and prayed were safe,'' the 55-year-oldChandra said. ``Those who dared to take a boat are either dead ormissing.''   ``The cyclone came and a wave 10 feet high crashed over theriver. The wind howled and uprooted many trees and destroyed manyhouses,'' the village elder said.   In Bangladesh, about 1,050 people died in the cyclone, a ReliefMinistry official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Saturday.   In India's West Bengal state, which abuts Bangladesh, theofficial death toll had reached 410 by Saturday.   The number of people still missing in Bangladesh, their fatesunknown, ranged from 3,000 to 5,000, according to newspapers inDhaka, the capital.   The newspapers estimated between 2.5 million and 5 million peoplewere left homeless by the cyclone that devastated 30 of thecountry's 64 administrative districts.   The actual number of deaths may never be known. Communication ispoor in much of the region, and bureaucracy slows the reporting ofverifiable deaths in some places.   In Perojpur, 65 miles northeast of Shoron Khola, local councilmember Hamiduz Zaman claimed the cyclone caused greater propertydamage than one that killed at least 300,000 people in 1970.   That cyclone, which struck a year before Bangladesh won itsindependence from Pakistan in civil war, confined its fury mostly tothe coastal region, while the latest storm reached more than 125miles inland.   ``Our latest cyclone did more damage to the standing crops, theinfrastructures, dwellings and telecomunications than the one in1970,'' Zaman said. ``In my subdistrict, only 14 lives were lost(this time) but there was colossal damage to the rice crop and themud-and-straw houses. Many of the people are too poor to build newhouses for many months.''   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who toured southwesternBangladesh on Thursday and Friday to visit the sites of greatestdevastation, said his government will mobilize its resources to helpthe people.   But the government of this impoverished nation, where the percapita annual income is $150 a year, will be hard-pressed to meetthe task.   Floods during the summer monsoon rains put three-fourths of thecountry under water, killing 1,500 people and destroying much of therice crop.   Cyclones and monsoon floods strike the low-lying nation withdeadly regularity. Most of Bangladesh is barely above sea level. Its110 million people live in the third-most densely populated land inthe world, after the city-states of Singapore and Hong Kong.   Bangladeshis live in an average of 2,000 people per square mile.If the present birth rate is not checked, the population willsurpass 200 million in the next 35 years.   Already, according to U.N. Officials in Dhaka, Bangladesh is oneof the world's largest recipients of foreign aid _ $2 billion waspledged before the summer floods.   The floods, which started in June and peaked in early September,brought additional offers of aid, although much of it was notadditional aid but a speeding up of foodstuffs, seed grain andhealth care materials already in the pipeline for futuredistribution.</TEXT></DOC>
