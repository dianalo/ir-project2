Then he became an industry critic, a verysuccessful one.   His later success is not in financial terms, however. The bighouse, for example, was sold and he and his wife live in a muchsmaller apartment now. He lost a lot of his old insurance industrybuddies, too.   And much of the time, he concedes, his ideas have simply bouncedoff the industry's tough hide. He talks of the frustration inobtaining understanding of his causes, but far less action.   But, he says, ``I wake up every morning knowing it will be agood day.'' He always sounds it, too. Though a very severe critic,and greatly upset by some life insurance practices, he retains anoutwardly serene demeanor.   Part of it comes from experience, since Joe _ with his computerprintouts _ was an important factor in developing IndividualRetirement Account legislation, some of which, to his chagrin, hassince been rescinded.   Now 70, collecting Social Security and a small amount from hisnearly inactive agency, he continues to argue that the lifeinsurance industry, by choice, fails to describe its products inways most beneficial to customers.   At his own expense he attends insurance meetings, sometimes as aspeaker. He needles state regulators. He grabs the attention ofconsumer advocates and legislators. He produces stacks of data andanalyses from his computer.   While he is respected in the industry for speaking his mind, heis feared, too, since he calmly strikes at some of the industry'smost respected tenets, even some of its moral precepts, and does soin plain, flat-out language.   At his own expense, for example, he has just designed, written,printed and published a four-page memorandum called ``How ToDiscover Your Gold Mine,'' in which he assaults the dictum that youshould never trade in your life insurance policy.   To the contrary, he says, it is often in your best interest todo so. All at once, he says, you might release thousands of dollarsin cash for your own use, retain or improve your coverage and payno further premiums.   Here is an example:   The original life insurance policy would pay the beneficiary$100,000 upon death of the insured. It required an annual premiumto the insurance company of $1,430. The policy contained $18,700 incash value.   It was discontinuued, and three new policies purchased:   1. Using the $18,700 cash from the old policy, a new $96,000policy became available, with no further premium payments required.   2. Using $715, one-half of the annual premium saved by switchingpolicies, a new, additional, $15,000 policy was purchased and madepayable to the original beneficiary.   3. Using the remainder of the saved premium, $715, a second$15,000 policy became available, with benefits assigned to a homefor the aged.   In this scenario, which is constructed from actual marketplacedata, the original $100,000 payable at death increases to $126,000.   This, and other situations he describes, document the title ofhis four-page memo, available from Gold Mine, Box 12066, Dallas,Texas 75225. For $2, he will send two copies for review by you andyour insurance agent.   Joe has a particular reason for suggesting you ``liberate'' yourfunds. ``Since rewards are common when one recovers a possessionthought lost forever, you may be willing to share these gains witha deserving organization.''   Such liberated money, he says, could be contributed to a church,synagogue, nursing home, hospital, school, home for the aged or acharity of your choice, including yourself. Share with them, hesays, rather than with the insurer.   Theoretically, he says, billions of dollars could be shared withneedy institutions _ he does not consider the insurers to fit thecategory _ if people examined their policies.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thurs Aug 4</NOTE></DOC>
