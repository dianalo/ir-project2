Thomas Kean must have set some sort of new standard with the recent announcement in my mailbox.    &quot;The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has ordered all residents to recycle effective August 1, 1987,&quot; it began. Reasonable enough, so far; recycling sounds like a worthy ecological effort, and, as the notice said, landfill space is dwindling.    Then came a hint of trouble: &quot;Residents must separate from their household garbage and recycle glass -- all colors, aluminum cans, unsoiled newspapers. . . .&quot; This is going to mean replacing one wastebasket with three at several stations and piling up newspapers somewhere. Well, I thought, OK.    Then came really bad news. &quot;Residents must take aluminum cans, glass and newspapers to the Conservation Center until further notice.&quot; So the guys who have come around faithfully to collect my garbage, all of it, come rain, come snow, for years, are now forbidden by law from so facilitating my life no matter what I offer to pay them. &quot;Your garbage collector cannot pick up your garbage if it contains any aluminum cans, glass or newspapers, under order and threat of fines by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection,&quot; the notice said.    The law tells me that in addition to working long hours, raising two kids and trying to maintain a social life I also have to pile my own glass and cans and newspapers into my car and drive them to the Conservation Center a mile away or have them smelling up the kitchen. Not a word was said about the elderly or injured who might soon be drowning in cans and bottles. Who passed this law, anyway?    Then came a list of rules that really blew me away. &quot;Cans must be washed and rinsed thoroughly. Glass beverage and food containers MUST be washed and rinsed throughly and caps and rings removed.&quot; (That's the state's capital letters and italics, like they mean business.)    Does this mean that after I dump a jar of mushrooms into the stew I have to put the jar in the dishwasher and run it full-cycle before taking it to the car and chauffeuring it to the Conservation Center? Will I need two dishwashers now, along with three garbage pails and a newspaper pile -- one dishwasher for the dishes, the other for empty mushroom jars, beer bottles, soup cans and the like?    How do I know what a particular can is made of, anyway? Is the state going to hire a metallurgist to guard the gate of the Conservation Center? Will I have to hire one for the kitchen? Or will metallurgical services maybe spring up, and stop by everybody's house once a day to tell you which pail to put which can in?    Next rule: &quot;No magazines.&quot;    The garbage collectors will not take newspapers, and the Conservation Center will not take magazines. So I'll need two reading-matter piles now, along with three garbage bins and two dishwashers. But what is, say, The New York Times Magazine? The Times is a newspaper, but the magazine says &quot;Magazine.&quot; What about the Times Book Review, the pullout tabloids The Wall Street Journal issues periodically, or the newsletters from all the do-good organizations I send $25 to?    Is the state going to have a reading-matter arbiter at the Conservation Center gate, next to the guy who decides whether my ginger-ale can is acceptable? And what happens if the Conservation Center arbiter won't take the Village Voice because he says it's a magazine, and the garbage company won't take it either because their arbiter says it's a newspaper? Do I have to keep it forever?    How much will garbage-collection rates rise if my carter has to pick through my garbage cans scouting for contraband? The new law could, of course, provide work for the homeless, who are the ones most skilled at this task. But how long will the lines be at the Conservation Center? The guys who check you at airports at least have mechanical metal detectors to help them. Is there a machine yet that can spot an old Playbill or a steel soup can through a full, 20-gallon hefty bag? Long searches seem inevitable.    And how high my newspaper piles will get! The notice says, &quot;All material accepted at Conservation Center 7 days a week except newspapers on 1st and 3rd Saturdays ONLY.&quot; Considering that our house gets two Timeses plus the Journal, Post, Newsday and what else I might bring home, plus the local weeklies if I'm out of town just one 1st or 3rd Saturday there could be a real fire hazard.    And what about the traditional use of newspapers for wrapping garbage? An editor here once kept tacked over his desk the perfectly sincere letter from a reader explaining at length that the Journal masked fish odors much better than the Times did (after reading, of course). But you can't put the fish bones and the newspaper in the same place anymore. Is it right or even possible to wrap mackeral remains in an Atlantic Monthly? Will people have to painstakingly dismantle an entire issue of National Geographic to give the puppy a place to wee?    I thought the mailbox notice might be a hoax until I turned on my all-news radio station and learned it was for real.    Gov. Kean, I have to hand it to you. Even George Orwell couldn't have thought of this.    ---   Mr. Kwitny is a Journal reporter based in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
