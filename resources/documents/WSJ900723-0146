After years of brisk expansion, private alcohol and drugtreatment centers are struggling to cope with fallingoccupancy rates and pressures to lower their charges. &quot;Wehave programs operating at 50% to 60% of capacity andclosing,&quot; says Michael Ford, president of the NationalAssociation of Addiction Treatment Providers. In contrast, hesays, during the &quot;boom times&quot; three or four years ago, &quot;itwasn't unusual for programs to be operating at 80% ofcapacity.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Addiction problems aren't going away. Indeed, theovercapacity in the private treatment industry, to whichemployees with benefits often turn, contrasts sharply withpublic treatment centers, used by those without benefits,where shortages of space produce long waiting lists.   But employers and insurance companies are clamping down onthe soaring cost of private treatment. The savings realizedby corporations may come at the expense of patients, who arefacing new restrictions on their choices in the kind andlength of care they receive. Therapists complain that limitson the length of stay are compromising treatment results, butcorporate officials respond that cost control and successfultreatment aren't incompatible.   Last year the cost of mental health and substance abusebenefits soared 47% for companies with more than 5,000employees, according to a survey by A. Foster Higgins andamp; Co.,a benefit consulting firm. Because smaller companies oftenoffer less generous benefits, the cost to all businesses ofpsychiatric and addiction treatment rose by a more modest18%, the survey shows.   Fed up with these increases, companies are fighting back.Many are hiring &quot;utilization review&quot; firms that monitor thelength of treatment and decide when patients are ready to gohome; the firms generally get to keep a share of health-caresavings they find for their clients. Other employers aresetting up &quot;managed care&quot; systems, which prescribe treatmentplans for patients going into therapy.   Brown andamp; Root Inc., a Houston-based construction subsidiaryof Halliburton Co., saw its costs for mental health andsubstance abuse treatment drop $590,000 in this year's firstquarter after it adopted a managed-care plan.   In the past, the amount of care given often was determinedby the willingness of insurers and employers to pay. Becauseinsurers paid for up to 28 days of treatment, that became theindustry standard for substance abuse programs. To be sure,prices for that stay have varied widely; the nonprofit BettyFord Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., charges $250 a day,while an Arizona treatment facility owned by Sierra TucsonCos. charges $550 a day. But the four-week duration waswidespread. &quot;There was no individualized treatment,&quot; saysRichard Wall, the coordinator of Mobil Corp.'s employeeassistance programs.   During the 1980s, fueled by generous reimbursementpolicies and public concern about drug and alcohol abuse, theprivate treatment industry expanded rapidly. &quot;They continuedto build capacity without taking into account managed careand employers' efforts to control cost,&quot; says Michael Cadgerof Foster Higgins.   But now the industry is scrambling to respond. Mostcenters are offering discounts of up to 30% to care managerswho can provide volume business. In the face of corporatedemands for shorter, cheaper inpatient programs, 28-dayprograms have become a thing of the past. &quot;The averageinpatient stay now is 17 to 21 days, down from 28 to 30 daystwo or three years ago,&quot; says the trade group's Mr. Ford. Theshorter stays are supplemented by intensive outpatienttherapy, which allows an employee or a family member toreturn to work sooner.   Marketing efforts are expanding. The Bradford Group, whichowns inpatient treatment centers in Alabama and outpatienttreatment facilities in major cities, has stepped up effortsto contact managers of employee assistance program about itssubstance abuse programs. The company is also working totailor treatment programs to the needs -- and budgets -- ofsmaller employers that might not ordinarily offer such care.   In recent years, the private treatment industry has reliedon advertising to attract patients, but some facilities arechanging their ad strategies. Comprehensive Care Corp., atreatment chain based in St. Louis, has moved most of itsadvertising to radio and print from television. The companyis trying to &quot;break out of the clutter,&quot; says LaurenceSteudle, a Comprehensive Care senior vice president. &quot;The TVviewer is confused by the Partnership for a Drug-FreeAmerica&quot; public service announcements, as well as ads fromcompeting treatment centers, he says. In addition, thecompany says radio is the best way to reach its mostpromising target group -- young, single males.   The industry also is consolidating. Comprehensive Care hasclosed two facilities this year and reduced the number ofbeds it owns or manages to 2,735 from 4,096 in 1988. Theoccupancy rate in its 15 hospitals has fallen to 30% from 63%two years ago. The company, which had a loss in the ninemonths ended in February of $29.3 million, including a $14.2million pretax write-down of assets, blames toughcompetition, reduced insurance coverage for treatment,shorter stays and the need to offer price discounts to winmanaged care business.   Earlier this year, St. Luke's Health System in Phoenixclosed an 80-bed inpatient treatment facility in a suburbwhere the number of mental health and substance abuse bedshad risen to 432 at the end of last year from 74 in 1985.   &quot;The market was oversaturated,&quot; says Terry Ashoff Johnson,St. Luke's vice president for marketing. Employers &quot;arelooking at utilization, and they're looking at cost.&quot; TheBradford Group has closed 160 of the 400 beds it opened inAlabama several years ago. &quot;We see a lot of people bailingout,&quot; says E.N. Burson, Bradford's president.   Even the Betty Ford Center, the inspiration of the formerfirst lady, is feeling the impact. Its occupancy rate hasdropped to 90% from 100%, and its four-week waiting list hasevaporated.   &quot;We're feeling the effect of managed care, definitely,&quot;says John Schwarzlose, the center's executive vice president.&quot;Patients who want to come here are told by their insurancecompanies that they can't, or patients come here and then aretold by the insurance company that they can't stay for morethan two weeks.&quot; Mr. Schwarzlose says managed care oftenmeans accountants are making treatment decisions that shouldbe left to therapists.   The treatment industry and some independent analysts worrythat shorter stays will be less successful. The readmissionrate within six months of initial treatment is 15.5% forinpatient therapy lasting 15 to 24 days, almost twice thereadmission rate after longer stays, according to a study byMedstat Systems Inc., an Ann Arbor, Mich., health-careinformation firm.   &quot;I believe the concept of managed care and costcontainment is good,&quot; says the Bradford Group's Mr. Burson.&quot;It's the implementation that's questionable. There areincentives based purely on cost-cutting. Patients are beingharmed.&quot;   But advocates of managed care argue that well-structuredplans featuring short inpatient treatment for detoxificationand initial therapy, followed by outpatient sessions, canboth save money and provide effective care. Saul Honigstein,president of American Psych-Management Inc., a healthconsulting company in Arlington, Va., says, &quot;If you do itright, it may in fact be better care.&quot;   Though treatment centers fret about the push to dischargepatients quickly, some admit that the pressure has forcedthem to look for ways to make treatment more efficient. &quot;Weused to let {new patients} just rest for three to five daysand eat well. We spent a lot more time putting patients in astate of readiness to accept treatment,&quot; says Mitzi Carroll,the executive director of Keystone Treatment Center, aCanton, S.D., unit of Comprehensive Addiction Programs Inc.,Vienna, Va. But &quot;we have increased the pressure on theclinicians to get started right away,&quot; she says.   Keystone, which charges a standard rate of $269 a day,also says it's giving more free or discounted care topatients after their insurance runs out. &quot;When it's veryobvious to us that it's too early to discharge the patient,then the responsibility falls on the patient or on thetreatment center&quot; to continue therapy without insurance, Ms.Carroll says. &quot;We find it particularly true in our adolescentpopulation, which we believe very strongly requires longertreatment.&quot;   ---               The Cost of Getting Unhooked                                                                                                          Employers' rising inpatient treatment costs for drug andalcohol addiction                                                                                                                                                          % CHANGE                   1985     1986     1987    1988   1985-88                                                                                                        Admissions per 1,000 employees and family members           2.42     3.00     3.43    3.77    +55.8%                                                                                                        Average days in treatment     21.81    22.90    22.22   22.92     +5.1%                                                                                                        Payments per person covered  $13.45   $21.96   $25.20  $30.84   +129.3%                                                                                                          *The figures are based on a sample of companies with 5,000or more employees.
