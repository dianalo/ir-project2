 &quot;If you're looking to purchase, realize thatdistributed database' is not a binary state of 'have it' or 'don't,'&quot;cautioned Jeffrey Tash, president of Database Decisions, a consulting firm inNewton, Mass.andM;DRIVING FORCESandM;The apocryphal MIS director has already achieved the first step inunderstanding how to go about implementing a distributed DBMS solution.andO;People, more than technology, distribute data.andP;  If technology alone were theanswer, probably the most reliable and cost-efficient solution would be hugecentralized mainframe-based database managers.andP;  But the current is runningthe other way--user demand spurred the development of low-end and midrangecomputing.andM;That trend brought a whole new set problems.andP;  Personal computers,departmental computing and geographically distributed mainframes led to theneed to unify information, but the data's owners are only willing to shareit, not give it away.andP;  Culturally speaking, the issue is that Americansespecially hate to depend on anyone else, and want control over their owndata.andP;  For many users, PCs were ego-effective long before they werecost-effective.andP;  That is one big reason why we arrived at today's state ofaffairs.andM;A major force behind today's distributed DBMS evolution is the need to accessor consolidate privately owned data that is physically distributed.andP;  For themost part, data remains physically distributed; centralizing the data is notcost-effective or politically possible.andM;For many new systems, and many new bodies of data, centralization is clearlythe second choice.andP;  In the case of distributing systems that five years agomight have been centralized, Ken Jacobs of Oracle Corp., Redwood City,Calif., stated, &quot;It's the economics of mid- to low-range computing.andP;  Comparedto a central site, networks are reliable and economical, although difficultto administer.&quot;andM;Another benefit of distributed databases is the ability to increase computingcapacity through adding more computers rather than expanding existingcomputers.andP;  &quot;If your cart becomes too much for your horse to pull, do youtrade for a bigger horse, or get a second horse?&quot; asked Umang Gupta,president of Gupta Technologies, Menlo Park, Calif.andM;&quot;But the most common reason for using distributed systems is to give accessto users from their desktop to data stored everywhere,&quot; he continued.andP;  &quot;Aninsurance agent might keep the data on the local customers, and make a policychange by accessing corporate actuarial information, changing the localdatabase, and then sending the update back to the mainframe.&quot;andM;Distributed database systems can be categorized as homogeneous orheterogeneous--for example, three Ingres sites from Ingres Corp., Alameda,Calif., vs.andP;  a system built on one Oracle and two IBM DB2 databases.andM;Under one approach to distributed data, which many vendors support, databasesare linked through a gateway, or intelligent interface.andP;  The location of thedata is not user-transparent; so strictly speaking, this approach doesn'tsatisfy the definition of distributed DBMS used earlier because users have toknow where to go to get their data.andM;Usually the database being linked to is available for query, not update.andO;This is more properly referred to as remote data access (RDA), networkedsystems or distributed processing.andP;  Focus, from Information Builders Inc.,andO;New York, is one of the most advanced and complete systems of this sort.andM;This is certainly a valuable technology in today's business computing world,but the scope of distributed databases extends past data access.andP;  Today'sgateways would be greatly improved if the RDA standard for handling updatesand messages among different products were in place.andP;  There is someprogress--IBM is working with OSI to help resolve differences between itsLU6.2 protocols and OSI's Distributed RDA.andM;From a user or application program perspective, the next level of distributedDBMS complexity involves granting query and update capability across multiplephysical databases.andP;  For query purposes, the databases may be homogeneous orheterogeneous; but for best performance, the requests are optimized.andO;Queries, or requests that are optimized for performance, will follow the mostdirect route to where the data resides, regardless of whether the data ispulled from one (homogeneous) or several (heterogeneous) databases.andM;However, in most current distributed DBMS implementations offering an updatecapability, the databases are probably homogeneous, because it is easier toenforce locking and integrity controls.andP;  An ongoing concern is that when anupdate capability is granted, data can be changed by the user.andP;  This changeaffects the integrity of the data if not handled properly (especially ifacross multiple environments, updating data in several databases at once;that is, heterogeneous).andM;The highest level of complexity is heterogeneous distributed databases withfull update capability.andP;  This capability is available today in only certaincombinations of products, and with varying degrees of programming effortrequired.andP;  The available products still fall short of the goal that adistributed system should look exactly like a nondistributed system.andM;According to Eric Wasiolek, marketing manager at Ingres Corp., a distributeddatabase system should handle the following three function: distributedqueries, with optimization; distributed updates, with recovery; anddistributed database administration.andP;  The administration function iscritical, yet often neglected by most vendors.andM;According to Database Decisions' Tash, &quot;Today's single biggest need is notfor a distributed database.andP;  It is for a distributed data dictionary.andP;  Thisisn't even a technical problem; it's a data administration problem.andP;  We'vegot a Tower of Babel.&quot;andM;Ingres/Star, Ingres' gateway product, offers a global data dictionary thatresides on one central machine.andP;  While technically sound, the approach sharesthe same problem that centralizing previously distributed data creates.andO;&quot;Politically, it's often not feasible to centralize what was previouslyseparate.andP;  The sites won't give up control.andP;  It only works when a new systemis centralized from the start, and then deployed,&quot; said Tash.andM;Ingres/Star's global data dictionary contains information about the locationof data, and this is used to optimize requests.andP;  The reward is significantlyimproved performance.andP;  The penalty occurs when the central site goes down.andO;To compensate for this vulnerability, the network must be more robust toprevent central site failure or bottleneck, or the central site must bereplicated, increasing overhead.andM;However, a central site is not a necessary evil for query optimization.andO;Informix Software, Inc., Menlo Park, Calif., has developed an optimizerwithout centralizing the data dictionary.andP;  It does this by sending messagesto dictionaries at other nodes to determine how to satisfy the request mostefficiently.andM;Tash noted, &quot;This is certainly more advanced that Ingres' technique, but withall of these messages, at what point does the opimization cost more than thequery?&quot;andM;DBMS INDEPENDENCEandM;C.J.andP;  Date, a consultant now with Codd andamp; Date, Inc., San Jose, Calif.,andO;developed 12 rules for an ideal distributed database system.andP;  Today, nosoftware meets all of these criteria.andP;  None of the 12 rules states that adistributed system must use one DBMS, but rule 12--DBMS independence--cannotbe satisfied with today's technology, Data asserts.andM;Enabling different DBMSs to act as equal partners in a distributed systemshould be possible, but it will certainly be more difficult than using oneDBMS product at multiple sites.andP;  One reason, among many, for this difficultyis the number of different SQL dialects.andP;  However, in the interim, imperfectheterogeneous distributed DBMS implementations may prove to be more valuablethan perfect implementations of a homogeneous system because mostorganizations run multiple DBMSs.andP;  Reality always wins.andM;Another of Date's rules concerns data replication.andP;  The advantages ofreplicated data are fewer remote accesses (due to more local copies), and theavailability of another copy if the first is down or locked for update.andP;  Themajor disadvantage is that if one copy is updated, all should beupdated--automatically.andP;  Few vendors offer this level of replication.andP;  Andkeeping all replicas synchronized can cause tremendous network traffic.andM;However, realtime synchronization is not always necessary.andP;  HerbertEdelstein, a principal of Euclid Associates, a consulting firm in Berkeley,Calif., lists several exceptions he has encountered.andP;  &quot;Day-to-daysynchronization of the replicas may be sufficient.andP;  Or perhaps the replicasconsist of primary key values.andP;  These are usually stable over time,&quot; he said,&quot;so changes wouldn't swamp the network.andP;  Or if there are additions, often abusiness rule can be imposed that restricts the use of that value until it'sreplicated.andP;  If Chicago adds a new customer, only Chicago can book orders forit that first day.&quot;andM;Dick Hatch, chairman of the board and CEO of Hatch and Fortwangler, Inc., aconsulting firm in Pembroke, Maine, uses the replication facilities ofCA-Star with Datacom databases from Computer Associates International, GardenCity, N.Y., for U.S.andP;  Customs in Washington.andP;  The system is distributedacross multiple mainframes due to sheer size.andP;  Replicas are used forperformance and load balancing, and for maintaining &quot;hot duplicates&quot; in caseof disk drive failure.andM;&quot;If one of the replicas goes down, perhaps due to communications or nodefailure, I have a choice of either halting updates to all copies andcontinuing read-only, or continuing updates to the other copies and laterresynchronizing the failed replica,&quot; said Hatch.andP;  &quot;Most vendors don't giveyou that second choice.&quot;andM;TWO-PHASE COMMITandM;One of the other big problems with replication is the protocol that ensuresconsistent updating across multiple copies or, as it is often called,two-phase commit.andP;  It is a critical function of any distributed system.andM;Basically, the protocol ensures that all copies of an object are updated, ornone are.andP;  If an update fails at one site, the updates at the other sites arerolled back.andP;  This causes updates to fail more frequently, but guarantees theintegrity when an update succeeds.andP;  It also requires numerous messages tocross the network between nodes for each update.andM;Two-phase commit is available with Sybase from Sybase, Inc., Emeryville,Calif.; Ingres/Star; InterBase from Interbase Software Corporation, Bedford,Mass.; Rdb from Digital Equipment Corporation, Maynard, Mass.; Empress fromEmpress Software, Inc., Greenbelt, Md.; and CA-Star from Computer Associates.andM;WAITING TO DO IT RIGHTandM;The notable exceptions are Oracle, Informix and DB2.andP;  According to Oracle'sJacobs, &quot;Oracle is waiting to provide two-phase commit until we can do itproperly, with user transparency and full automatic recovery across allnetwork topologies and across heterogeneous databases.&quot;andM;IBM's DB2 offers only single-site update, even on version 2 release 2.andO;According to consultant Tash, &quot;Two-phase commit doesn't happen in DB2 untilthey get to 'distributed unit of work'; and before that arrives they're goingthrough the stages of 'remote request,' which is like a micro-mainframe link;and 'remote unit of work,' which is like client/server.andP;  Then comes this'distributed unit of work,' and then finally 'distributed request,' which iswhat most people think of when they think of distributed database.andP;  By thenit's ll be 1994.&quot;andM;Today's two-phase commit offerings can be categorized as automatic orprogrammatic.andP;  John Kornatowski, president of Empress Software, said, &quot;Ourautomatic two-phase commit is built into the Empress kernel and simplyinitiated by the developer.andP;  It allows updating of views which span multiplenodes, transparent to the user.&quot;andP;  Ingres/Star and Interbase also offerautomatic two-phase commit.andM;An automatic implementation is not always desirable.andP;  Steven Olson, seniorsoftware engineer for SQL Solutions, a Sybase-owned company in Burlington,Mass., worked on a Sybase distributed application for Northern Telecom,Research Triangle Park, N.C., to monitor the status of telephone lines.andO;Sybase uses a programmatic implementation, which allows some flexibility.andO;Olson said, &quot;If someone with a backhoe causes a failure in the network, thesystem must detect it and notify the repairmen of the location and severity.&quot;andO;The network does not come to a halt.andM;&quot;It would have been nice if one transaction could have updated all copies ofthe data, but it was unacceptable that if a node was down, the update wasrolled back everywhere,&quot; Olson said.andM;At U.S.andP;  Customs, consultant Hatch said, &quot;Even though CA-Star offers anexcellent two-phase commit, there would be problems if our tables werefrequently down.andP;  Our two and a half million CICS transactions per daygenerate about half a million database requests.andP;  Fortunately, we don't facetypical communications problems, because all of our mainframes are in onelocation.&quot;andM;A different approach to distributed databases is the fault-toleranthardware-software solution developed by Tandem Computers, Cupertino, Calif.andO;Tandem has solved many of the problems with which other distributed databasesare still wrestling.andM;Data stored on a Tandem system and managed by Tandem's NonStop SQLdistributed database can be accessed using tools provided by Ingres, Oracle,Focus and Sybase.andM;WHAT'S MISSING?andM;Distributed technology must overcome several hurdles.andP;  Distribution across awide-area network increases the network traffic problems tremendouslycompared to a local-area network.andP;  And traffic only increases with suchdesirable capabilities as two-phase commits, data replication and distributedtransaction management.andP;  Query optimization becomes essential to avoidbringing the data mountain to Mohammed.andM;According to Edelstein from Euclid Associates, &quot;I'm adding rule13--performance transparency.andP;  If you can tell your system is distributed byusing a stopwatch or even a calendar, then there's something missing.&quot;andM;Heterogeneous distributed database access is crippled by a lack of standards.andO;A SQL standard must emerge, and it cannot be the least common denominator ofthe dialects.andP;  The RDA standard is also sorely needed.andP;  Today, if n DBMSswant to talk to m DBMSs, n*m gateways are needed.andP;  With an RDA standard, onlyn would be needed.andM;Other holes that need to be filled include network security support andsecurity administration, and standardized name servers to locate a user or aprinter across nodes.andM;Even if problems of performance and interproduct access standards were solvedtoday, the data is often not ready to be joined.andP;  What if two databases storepricing information in different currencies?andP;  What if one system reflects aone-to-one relationship and another calls it one-to-many?andM;Work is needed on application deployment--how does one provide a new versionof an application to 5,000 PCs?andM;DB2 must become fully distributed, which according to IBM's Bob McIvor,senior planner in the strategy and market planning organization of the SantaTeresa Laboratory, will occur in the mid-'90s.andP;  &quot;Our fundamental objective isto protect the integrity of the data.andP;  Our distributed version will have allthe things our customers expect in a single DBMS--security, integrity,recoverability and performance.andM;&quot;IBM's Distributed Relational Database Access (DRDA) will encompass DB2 onMVS, SQL/DS on VM, and the OS/400 and OS/2EE database managers,&quot; said McIvor.andM;Consultant Tash commented, &quot;Today, IBM offers some distribution between DB2and DB2, but people want OS/2 to DB2.&quot;andP;  In any market other than the computerindustry, if the leader lagged by five years in an important feature, thecompetitors would seize the throne.andP;  But here, the other vendors must waitfor DB2 to catch up.andP;  For most vendors, it is more important to offerdistributed access to DB2 than to their own databases.andM;With all of these hurdles, is distributed the way to go?andP;  &quot;Certainly, it'sstill in its infancy,&quot; said Keith Toleman marketing manager, MicroproductsDivision, Information Builders, Inc.andP;  &quot;The security, the communications, thenetworking--all must be so much more advanced.andP;  That's why we promotedistributed applications more than distributed databases.&quot;andM;CLIENT/SERVER APPROACHandM;He continued, &quot;This is a client/server approach where you keep the data inone place on the mainframe, and your application runs on the PC to handleyour screens and data formatting and so on.andP;  The data looks local, and youoffload mainframe cycles.andP;  And with [Information Builders'] Focus, your hostplatform and its database can be whatever you have or want.&quot;andM;Other traditional mainframe software vendors are also developing distributedproduct strategies based on the client/server model.andP;  Cincom Systems, Inc. inCincinnati, Ohio, for example, previewed a distributed version of Supra,which is based on a client/server paradigm, at its recent user conference.andM;With the current lack of standards and flux in the market, other factors comeinto play.andP;  Consultant Tash said, &quot;Even more than distributed databases, keepyour eyes on these three: cooperative processing, snapshots and partitioneddata.&quot;andP;  Cooperative processing involves distributed processing butcentralized data.andP;  Tash predicted that small distributed systems will notreplace the large mainframes.andP;  &quot;That would require giving up control.andM;&quot;Summary-level snapshots will be taken from DB2 once a day or once a week andput on LANs and servers,&quot; Tash continued, &quot;and we will see partitioned datafor local or departmental applications on machines like DEC VAXes.&quot;andM;During the next year, progress is likely on proposed relational databaseaccess standard protocols, to improve heterogeneous database query and updatecapabilities.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
