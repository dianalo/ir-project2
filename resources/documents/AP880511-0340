Several big banks, pressured by increased costs of borrowingmoney themselves, raised their prime lending rate from 8.5 percentto 9 percent, nearly erasing the results of three rate decreasesover the past seven months. Chase Manhattan Bank led the move andwas followed by competitors.   The prime rate lags behind more subtle increases in interestrates elsewhere. But the rate is closely watched because bankersuse it as a basis for calculating loans to businesses, as well asdetermining many types of consumer loans, including increasinglypopular home-equity loans.   Stock traders reacted badly to the rate rise, partly because itaroused memories of the higher interest rates that preceded thestock crash. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.80 points toa three-month low of 1,965.85.   The last time banks raised the prime rate was in September, whenit went from 8.75 percent to 9.25 percent. The rate retreated to 9percent on Oct. 22, two days after the Black Monday stock collapse.It fell to 8.75 percent Nov. 5 and to 8.5 percent Feb. 2.   The prime-rate increase partly reflected moves by the FederalReserve, the nation's central bank, to nudge interest rates higherin order to forestall sharp increases in inflation that manyanalysts fear might accompany recent surprisingly strong economicgrowth.   The clearest evidence of that growth came last week when theLabor Department said unemployment had hit a 14-year low. Thissuggested worker shortages will rise, pushing up wages andintensifying demands for goods and services that increase the costof living and doing business, many economists said.   ``Interest rates are going up now basically because the Feddragged and dragged its feet and finally was presented withincontrovertible evidence that the economy was doing well, perhapstoo well,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist for NikkoSecurities International Inc. in New York. ``So the Fed couldn'tjust sit by and do nothing.''   Sandra Shaber, an economist at the Futures Group, aWashington-based forcasting firm, said the prime rate increasewould have a broader effect now than in years past because it is nolonger just a benchmark rate for new loans to a bank's bestcorporate customers.   ``What does it mean for consumers? Once upon a time, the impactwould have been limited,'' she said. ``But now, because of theincreased use of home-equity loans and other adjustable rates, evenpeople who have current debt outstanding, they feel the effects.Their financing costs rise. It squeezes their discretionaryspending in general.''   The Fed has two fundamental choices in trying to balanceeconomic growth and inflation: It can control the amount of moneyin the banking system and can adjust its key lending fee tofinancial institutions, known as the discount rate. That rate hasstood at 6 percent since Sept. 4.   Economists said it was clear the Fed had recently tightened theamount of money in the banking system. But some doubted the Fedwould act quickly to raise the discount rate, which would beconsidered a much stronger sign of tightening.   ``My guess is the Fed will not try to push interest rates upbeyond current levels,'' said David Blitzer, chief economist forStandard andamp; Poor's Corp., a major investment research andcredit-rating concern.   ``There will be concern about the impact on the economy,especially in housing and auto sales,'' he said. ``Secondly, theinflation fears are a little bit overdone.''   Some economists said the low unemployment rates did notnecessarily mean impending inflation. They argued that despiterecord numbers of people working, wages generally have not beenrising.   Others said it was clear that higher prices are looming, partlybecause of the increased cost of oil, grain and other commodities,as well as the impact of a lower dollar, which makes imports moreexpensive.   Nevertheless, many economists agreed the Fed would remainextremely reluctant to push up interest rates sharply and risk arecession, especially in an election year.   They also said the central bank had learned from thedouble-digit inflation experience of the late 1970s that a littletightening now eliminates the need for more severe action later.   ``The Fed understands if you let this process get out of hand,then you have a very hard time stopping it and you need incrediblyhigh interest rates,'' Brusca said. ``It wants to tap the brakes alittle bit rather than slam them on in a great fury.''</TEXT></DOC>
