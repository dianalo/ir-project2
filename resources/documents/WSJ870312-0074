District Judge Thomas Jackson, who on Feb. 25 temporarily blocked independent counsel Whitney North Seymour Jr. from seeking indictments against Mr. Deaver, yesterday removed any impediment to grand jury action.    After an hourlong hearing, Judge Jackson yesterday issued a six-page ruling saying that Mr. Deaver isn't likely to succeed in his challenge to the constitutionality of the independent counsel law and, therefore, isn't entitled to an injunction.    But Randall Turk, one of Mr. Deaver's lawyers, said the denial of the injunction will be challenged in federal appeals court this morning. Mr. Turk said the lawyers also will ask the appeals court to stop Mr. Seymour from going to the grand jury while the appeal is pending.    &quot;We're disappointed with the denial of the application for a preliminary injunction,&quot; Mr. Turk said. But he added, &quot;We're heartened by Judge Jackson's memorandum, which recognizes that it's a serious legal, constitutional question.&quot;    Mr. Deaver's lawyers challenged the constitutionality of the law because it provides for court-appointed independent counsels to exercise prosecutorial power that usually is reserved for officials appointed by the president. &quot;This is the antithesis of the type of separation of powers we should be expecting,&quot; Herbert Miller, another of Mr. Deaver's lawyers, said at yesterday's court hearing.    A similar lawsuit was filed by former National Security Council aide Lt. Col. Oliver North, who is being investigated by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh. A federal court hearing was held Monday in that case, and the judge's ruling on whether to block that probe is expected any time.    In yesterday's ruling, Judge Jackson said Supreme Court rulings on the separation-of-powers doctrine don't clearly answer the question of whether independent counsels are constitutional. &quot;This court remains unconvinced that any result is clearly foreordained&quot; by precedents, Judge Jackson wrote. But he concluded that the law will likely be upheld because the Constitution says Congress may authorize the judiciary to appoint some &quot;inferior officers&quot; of the government.    But, in specifically allowing an immediate appeal by Mr. Deaver's lawyers, Judge Jackson said that &quot;there is substantial ground for difference of opinion&quot; about the independent counsel law.    The judge said there is a &quot;public interest&quot; in resolving the constitutional issues quickly and in seeing &quot;that any possible violations of the criminal law be speedily prosecuted.&quot; Mr. Deaver didn't attend the hearing.    Judge Jackson also suggested that Mr. Deaver's lawsuit may be premature. Lawyers who have criticized the filing of the suit say it would be unusual, and possibly unprecedented, for a court to block a criminal investigation before an indictment. Claims that an investigation is unconstitutional are better handled by seeking to have the indictment dismissed as invalid after a grand jury has acted. In his order yesterday, Judge Jackson said Mr. Deaver's complaints about the law aren't &quot;presently ripe.&quot;    At a court hearing late last month, Mr. Seymour said he planned to ask a grand jury to indict Mr. Deaver, former deputy White House chief of staff and a longtime friend of President and Mrs. Reagan, on four counts of lying to a federal grand jury and to a House subcommittee. Mr. Seymour was appointed by a special court in May to investigate possible conflicts of interest involving Mr. Deaver's lobbying after he left the White House. </TEXT></DOC>
