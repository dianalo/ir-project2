The pact was tentatively approved by the union and Ford Motor Co.'s Canadian unit Thursday, a few hours before the union's deadline for a strike or settlement. The agreement covers 13,000 Ford Canada workers. Ninety percent of the members voting approved the new contract.    As previously reported, the pact closely resembles the pattern-setting agreement the union reached last month with Chrysler Corp.'s Canadian unit. Both pacts include inflation-indexed pension payments to future retirees, fixed annual increases to current pensioners, and annual wage increases of 3%, 1.5%, and 1.5% respectively in each year of the accord.    The settlement leaves General Motors Corp.'s Canadian unit as the only one of the Big Three U.S. auto makers' Canadian units without a new contract. The union's previous contracts with the companies expired Sept. 14.    The union intends to seek similar terms, including its chief demand of inflation-indexed pensions, at General Motors of Canada Ltd. But union president Robert White said he won't set a deadline for a strike or settlement with GM Canada until the parent company's talks with the United Auto Workers union are near an end. The UAW has yet to set a deadline for a strike or settlement at GM.    The Canadian union represents 40,000 workers at GM Canada. </TEXT></DOC>
