A final rule on thissubject was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 29, 1979 (44 FR 38247).The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a major rulefor the purpose of EO 12291. The Bureau of Prisons has determined thatEO 12291 does not apply to this rule since the rule involves agency management.After review of the law and regulations, the Director, Bureau of Prisonshas certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (Pub. L. 96-354), does not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.Interested persons may participate in this proposed rulemaking by submittingdata, views, or arguments in writing to the Bureau of Prisons, Room 760,320 First Street, NW., Washington, DC 20534. Comments received furing thecomment period will be considered before final action is taken. The proposedrule may be changed in light of the comments received.

In andSection; 540.2, paragraph (c) and the undesignated paragraph whichfollows it are designated as new paragraph (i), paragraph (b) is redesignatedand revised as paragraph (d), and new paragraphs (b), (c), and (e) through(h) are added to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 540.2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>(b) The term ``media'' means agencies or organizations whose principalpurpose is to gather and disseminate factual information to the publicthrough various mechanisms including, but not limited to print, electronic,and other means of mass communication.(c) The term ``news media'' means any segment of the media as defined inparagraph (b) of this section whose principal purpose is the gatheringand at least weekly dissemination of current happenings, occurrences, oranything of interest to the general public, including, but not limitedto:(1) A newspaper which qualifies as a general circulation newspaper in thecommunity in which it is published. A newspaper is one of ``general circulation''if it circulates among the public and if it publishes news of public interest.A key test to decide whether a newspaper qualifies as a ``general circulation''newspaper is to determine whether the paper qualifies for the purpose ofpublishing legal notices in the community in which it is located or inthe area to which it distributes. It is generally held that for a newspaperto be considered, by law, a newspaper of general circulation, and so bequalified to publish legal notices, it must contain items of general interestto the public, such as news of political, religious, commercial, or socialaffairs; (2) A news magazine of national circulation that is sold by newsstandsand mail subscription to the general public;(3) A national or international news service; or (4) A radio or television news program of a station (or other non-printmedia) outlet holding a Federal Communications Commission license.(d) ``Reporter,'' or ``representative of the media,'' or ``representativeof the news media,'' or ``media representative'' means a person whose employmentis to gather or report news for news-gathering organizations. The followingelements can be used to evaluate the status of such a person. The person:(1) Works for a media organization as defined in this section as a primaryoccupation; (2) Works for a media organization as defined in this section for a salary,hourly wage, or any other schedule of compensation, regular or otherwise;(3) Works as a party to formal or informal arrangements with a news-gatheringorganization to submit material for publication through any channel, whenacting in a capacity other than a member of the general public, such asin a letter to the editor; and (4) Can present proof of previous professional publication for such a news-gatheringorganization. Because of the institutional resources needed to screen andprocess prospective interviews, ordinarily, only a member of the news media,as defined herein, may conduct a face-to-face interview with a specifiedinmate.(e) A ``business'' or ``profession'' is any activity conducted by an inmatethat entails a contractual arrangement or generates income through a non-Bureauof Prisons-approved program or activity, as contrasted with a work assignmentor an approved program or activity otherwise regulated by Bureau of Prisonspolicy. This income could derive from civilian sources directed by theinmate, or be created by the inmate through activities in the institutionthat are not approved for the generation of income. For this purpose ofthis policy, any writing or other creative product generated by an inmatein non-BOP approved activity, which generates more than $500 in gross incomein any one calendar year, is considered to be business activity, and isprohibited. Approved hobbycraft sales are permitted in accord with thepolicy regulating those activities, and inmates may receive cash awardsor prizes for participation in approved creative programs, up to the $500limit. The amount of the ceiling on hobbycraft profits shall be raised(in multiples of $50.00) wherever the Commissary purchase authority forinmates is raised, and to a comparable percentage increase.(f) For the purpose of Bureau of Prisons procedures, a ``manuscript'' isany pre-publication product of creative writing, including fiction, non-fiction,music, poetry, or cartoons, which contains text, music, lyrics, or othercreative writings, other than personal correspondence with the media. Manuscriptsare generally submitted for the purpose of publication as a stand-aloneliterary or musical product, e.g., a book, pamphlet, script, song or otherdocument. Manuscripts are typically prepared over a period of time, andare submitted to publishers or other non-media outlets; because of thetime involved in preparation and ultimate publication, manuscripts ordinarilydo not relate to current events.(g) For the purpose of Bureau of Prisons procedures, a ``by-lined article''is a written or other communication product published in the media (otherthan a letter to the editor) that is accompanied by the name of the author;is created and submitted to any media outlet (print or otherwise) for furtherdistribution through a periodical such as a newspaper, magazine, or othermechanism; is ordinarily intended to be published as part of a larger workproduct; and may deal with contemporary issues. (h) ``Creative writing'' includes all forms of writing other than legaldocuments and social or special mail correspondence. Creative writing activityis intended to encourage creativity and constructive structuring of leisuretime, and is not for the purpose of fund-raising; an inmate may not bepaid for creative writing activity.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>3.

To that end, representativesof the media may visit institutions for the purpose of preparing reportsabout the institution, its programs, and its activities, and to interviewinmates. It is not the intent of this rule to provide publicity for aninmate, or special privileges for the media by providing access to inmatesin a manner not otherwise available to the general public. These regulationsare intended to insure a better informed public, and to offer inmates anopportunity to exercise their First Amendment rights in ways that do notconflict with the security and orderly operation of the institutions wherethey are confined. An inmate's First Amendment rights to freedom of expression,and access to the institution by media representatives, may be restrictedwhen and if such expression or access would result in potential disruptionto the discipline and security of the institution, or material interferencewith the accomplishment of its mission. The Bureau of Prisons has a responsibilityto protect the privacy and other rights of inmates and members of the staff.Therefore, any media tours or interviews in an institution must be regulatedto safeguard those rights, and face-to-face interviews with inmates mustbe regulated to ensure the safe, orderly operation of the institution.(b) In general, media contacts fall into two broad categories. The firstare contacts of a general nature directed toward institutional programsand activities that have a public education purpose, and do not focus onany individual inmate or discrete group of identifiable inmates. The secondtype of media contact focuses on an individual inmate, identifiable groupof inmates, or some investigative subject. These contacts are not consideredto have a general public education purpose, but are rather intended tohave a specific expository outcome with regard to the inmates or programsinvolved. Different types of access and processing are involved for thesetwo very different types of media activity. (c) These rules apply to inmates in Federal institutions and on authorizedfurlough from Federal institutions. When a Federal prisoner is confinedas a contract boarder in any non-Federal facility or community corrections-typefacility, the local or State facility rules and regulations will govern.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 540.61</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Authorization.</ITAG>(a) A media representative who desires to make either a public education-typevisit or a news media representative who wishes to conduct an inmate interviewat an institution must make application in writing to the Warden on theletterhead of the news organization for which the tour or interview isto be conducted. Except as otherwise noted herein, the term ``Warden''refers to the Warden or the Warden's designee. The request ordinarily mustbe received at the institution not less than two working days in advanceof the requested visit or interview. It must indicate the scope of theintended interview, and affirm that the media representative is familiarwith the rules and regulations of the institution and agrees to complywith them. (b) Representatives of the media have a professional responsibility tomake a reasonable attempt to verify any allegations regarding an inmate,staff member, or institution. To ensure an opportunity to gather completeinformation regarding both sides of any issue in the institution, a representativeof the news media, as a condition of any face-to-face interview grantedby the Bureau, shall provide authorized staff of the Bureau of Prisonsan opportunity to respond to any allegation that might be published orbroadcast. (c) A representative of the media should collect information only fromthe primary source, and may not obtain and use personal information fromone inmate about another inmate who refuses to be interviewed, an act whichwould constitute a violation of that inmate's privacy. (d) A representative of the media who is on an inmate's authorized visitinglist will not be granted any form of media access to a Bureau institution.A media representative may not be added to an inmate's visiting list unlessthat inmate is an immediate family member, in which case, all media privilegeswill be suspended for that individual within the Bureau of Prisons.  (e) Failure by the media representative to adhere to the provisions setforth by this rule constitutes grounds for denying that media representative,or the organization that he or she represents, permission to conduct futureinterviews or tours in a BOP facility for up to one year.(f) Any limitation or denial of media access will be reported to the RegionalPublic Information Officer. Denial of access beyond a single visit willonly be upon written notice to the party involved, after consultation withthe Regional and Central Office public information officers, and reviewof the proposed letter of limitation or denial by the Regional Director.(g) A representative of the media may appeal any local decision to deny,or otherwise restrict access to the institution, to the Regional Director,and may further appeal any determination made at that level to the Directorof the Bureau of Prisons.(h) After the access limitation period has expired, the individual or organizationmay reapply for admission, in writing, to the Office of Public Affairs,Central Office, Washington, DC.(i) The Warden may suspend all categories of media visits during an institutionalemergency and for a reasonable time after the emergency. During such asuspension, the local institution may establish a local media center, offerregular informational briefings by the institution Public Information Officer,establish a media pool, and make available such facilities and servicesas are required, in the Warden's view, to ensure a smooth flow of publicinformation about the emergency.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 540.62</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General institutional visits.</ITAG>(a) General institutional visits are contacts of a general nature directedtoward institutional programs and activities, which have a public educationpurpose, and do not focus on any individual inmate or discrete group ofidentifiable inmates. A media representative shall make advance appointmentsfor this category of visit, which ordinarily should be held during regularbusiness hours for that institution. Institution staff will process allsuch requests expeditiously, and within two working days of receipt.(b) The institutional Public Information Officer is responsible for verifyingthe identity and credentials of all media personnel applying for admissionto the institution. All personnel making a request to take part in a mediatour or interview should be named in the request for the interview, andeach will supply their date of birth and social security number, in orderthat institutional staff may complete necessary identification proceduresprior to approval. Individuals not so identified at the time of the requestmay not be admitted.(c) When media representatives visit the institution, photographs of programsand activities may be taken. However, an inmate has the right not to beidentifiably photographed or have his or her voice identifiably recordedby the media. Accordingly, a visiting representative of the media is requiredto obtain written permission from an inmate before identifiably photographingor recording the voice of that inmate, or before distributing it.(d) Because of the large number of individuals who may potentially seekto obtain access to Bureau institutions under the auspices of other kindsof media activity, tours for representatives of non-news media organizations,and others, such as movie producers, researchers and free-lance writers,are ordinarily not approved. They may be permitted only by special arrangement,with approval of the Warden, and after conferring with the Regional PublicInformation Officer.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 540.63</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Personal interviews and other media contacts.</ITAG>(a) This type of media contact involves an individual inmate, identifiablegroup of inmates, or some investigative subject. These contacts are notconsidered to have a general public education purpose, but are rather intendedto have specific expository outcome with regard to the inmates or programsinvolved; they are ordinarily granted only to news media representatives.(b) Except as otherwise provided in Bureau policy, an inmate in a Federalinstitution may not conduct a business, be employed in an employee/employerrelationship, execute a contract or legally binding agreement, act as areporter, publish under a by-line, or execute a power of attorney or otherinstrument or mechanism that has the effect of circumventing these restrictionsor any other provision of this program statement.(c) Inasmuch as alternate access to the media is an important communicationoption, an inmate may correspond personally with representatives of themedia through established institutional correspondence procedures.(d) The use of the telephone is a legitimate avenue for inmates to useto contact the media. However, an inmate may not grant an interview thatis broadcast live, inasmuch as that process prevents the institution fromaccomplishing the review and response provisions of this policy. Inmatesmay not place third-party phone calls to media representatives.(e) In the interest of institutional security and order, an inmate currentlyconfined in an institution may not be employed or act as a reporter, publishunder a byline, or cause to be disseminated for compensation above theamount allowed by andSection; 540.2(e) of this part any manuscript with whichhis name is associated.(f) Except as otherwise provided in Bureau policy, an inmate may not receivecompensation or any consideration, directly or indirectly, for any creativework or time expended in any creative activity (this includes submissionof articles or other published works or any broadcast participation,) orfor interviews with the media, whether the nature of the media contactis face-to-face, by phone, or through correspondence. Creative productsthat draw upon an inmate's criminal activities may be subject to referralto the U.S. Attorney for consideration of forfeiture under Federal statute.(g) An inmate or a representative of the news media may initiate a requestfor a face-to-face interview.(1) Visits by the news media to conduct face-to-face inmate interviewsare subject to the same conditions stated in andSection; 540.62. A news mediarepresentative shall make a request for a personal interview, ordinarilyallowing two working days prior to the requested interview date.(2) Staff shall notify an inmate of each face-to-face interview request,and shall, as a prerequisite, obtain the inmate's written consent for anyinterview, photo, or voice recording for the interview prior to the interviewtaking place.(h) As a condition of granting the interview, an inmate must authorizeinstitutional staff to respond to comments made in the interview and torelease information to the media relative to the interview.(i) The Warden shall ordinarily approve or disapprove an interview requestwithin two working days of receipt by institution staff of the request.(j) The Warden shall document any disapproval. A request for interviewor visit may be denied for any of the following reasons:(1) The news media representative, or the organization which he or sherepresents, does not agree to the conditions established by this rule orhas, in the past, failed to abide by the required conditions.(2) The inmate is physically or mentally unable to participate. This mustbe supported by a medical officer's statement (a psychologist may be usedto verify mental incapacity) to be placed in the inmate's record, substantiatingthe reason for disapproval by the Warden.(3) The inmate is a juvenile (under age 18) and written consent has notbeen obtained from the inmate's parent or guardian. If the juvenile inmate'sparents or guardians are not known or their addresses are not known, theWarden of the institution shall notify the news media representative ofthe inmate's status as a juvenile, and shall then consider the request.The inmate's written consent, as specified in paragraph (g) of this section,is still required.(4) The interview, in the opinion of the Warden, would endanger the healthor safety of the interviewer, or would probably cause serious unrest ordisturb the good order of the institution.(5) The inmate is involved in a pending court action and the court havingjurisdiction has issued an order forbidding such interviews.(6) In the case of unconvicted persons (including competency commitmentsunder 18 USC 4241-43 and 4245-56) held in Federal institutions, interviewsare not authorized until there is documented clearance with the court havingjurisdiction, which ordinarily will be obtained through the U.S. Attorney'sOffice.(7) The Bureau has received objections from other Government agencies whichhave expressed an interest. Interviews requested with U.S. Immigrationand Naturalization (INS) detention cases will be cleared by the local INSoffice. Interview requests for inmates in whom other Government agencieshave expressed an interest will be cause for institution staff to notifythat agency of the proposed interview. Interviews for offenders held forother jurisdictions will be approved only with the concurrence of the courtor agency having final jurisdiction of the inmate.(8) The inmate is a ``protection'' case and disclosure of his or her whereaboutswould endanger the inmate's safety.(k) The Warden will establish the place and time of all media interviews,subject to the following conditions:(1) Ordinarily, inmate interviews will be scheduled during regular businesshours for that institution.(2) Face-to-face media interviews will ordinarily not be subject to auditorysupervision, but at the discretion of the Warden, they may be subject tosupervision in the same manner as other visits by the public. The presenceof an institutional Public Information Officer or other staff member willnot be construed as an opportunity for debate or other exchange of viewsbetween the reporter, inmate, and staff member; the employee is presentfor supervision purposes, not to participate in the interview.(3) Ordinarily, not more than one face-to-face interview per day will beheld in any institution, using an equitable method of apportioning accesswhen requests exceed one per day.(4) Ordinarily, an inmate will be limited to not more than one face-to-faceinterview per calendar month; in instances of multiple requests, the inmatewill be responsible for choosing which interview will be granted.(5) The Warden may establish additional limits on the length and numberof face-to-face interviews per month an inmate may have if confined inspecial housing status; e.g., segregation, restricted, holdover, controlunit, or hospital status, or if otherwise required by special security,custodial, supervisory, or operational needs.(6) The Warden may limit the amount of audio, video, and film equipmententering the institution, and limit to five the total number of media personneland technicians entering the institution; live television or radio broadcastsare not permitted. In the case of a pre-trial inmate, the attorney of recordand a representative of the U.S. Attorney's Office may also be present.(7) In the case of interviews that must be conducted in visiting roomsthat are frequently crowded, or in visiting rooms of maximum security institutions,the Warden may limit the equipment to hand-held cameras or recorders, andmay impose additional restrictions on the number of news media representativesor technicians permitted.(8) News media representatives are encouraged to tour Bureau institutionsin conjunction with a personal interview.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 540.64</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Media pools.</ITAG>(a) The Warden may establish a media pool whenever he or she determinesthat the frequency of requests for visits reaches a volume that warrantslimitations in order to ensure the efficiency of the tour process or conservestaff resources.(b) Whenever the Warden establishes a media pool under these circumstances,the Warden shall notify all media representatives who have requested interviewsor visits that have not been conducted that a pool will be authorized,and to what areas of the institution the pool will have access. The selectedrepresentatives will be admitted to the institution to conduct the interviewsunder specific guidelines established by the Warden.(c) The members of the media pool are selected by their peers by a processdetermined by those media representatives present and wishing to participate;institutional staff will not participate in the selection process. A mediapool shall consist of not more than one representative from each of thefollowing groups:(1) The national and international news services;(2) The television and radio networks and outlets; (3) Magazines and newspapers; and(4) All media in the local community where the institution is located.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">If no interest has been expressed by one or more of these groups,no representative from such group need be selected.(d) All news material generated by such a media pool is made availableto all media without right of first publication or broadcast.(e) In order to preserve the principle that inmates will not use mediaaccess for personal notoriety or advancement of any kind, inmates may notconvene or conduct a media conference, or be interviewed by the media ina pool situation. However, when in the judgement of the Warden, such ahigh level of media interest exists regarding one inmate that normal institutionalresources cannot meet a legitimate public information need, then pool selectionprocedures may be modified. In this situation, the Warden may allow a separateinterview (not to exceed a total of four) by a single representative ofeach of the four categories of news media enumerated above, chosen by proceduresagreed upon by the members of the media themselves. In this circumstancethe successive, individual pool interviews will together count as thatinmate's interview for that month.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 540.65 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Release of information.</ITAG>(a) The Warden will ordinarily make announcements to the media of factssurrounding unusual or newsworthy incidents. Examples are deaths, escapes,and institution emergencies.(b) The Warden shall provide information about an inmate that is a matterof public record to the representatives of the media upon request. Theinformation is limited to the inmates:(1) Name;(2) Register number;(3) Place of incarceration;(4) Age;(5) Race;(6) Conviction and sentencing data: this includes the offense(s) for whichconvicted, the court where convicted, the date of sentencing, the lengthof sentence(s), the amount of good time earned or available, the paroleeligibility date and parole release (presumptive or effective) date, andthe date of expiration of sentence, and includes previous Federal, State,and local convictions;(7) Past movement via transfers or writs;(8) General institutional assignments; and (9) Release destination.(c) The Warden of each institution, or his/her designated representative,is solely responsible for contact with the media.(d) Information in paragraphs (b)(1) through (9) of this section may notbe released if confidential for protection cases, or otherwise in conflictwith any provisions of the Privacy Act.(e) A request for additional information concerning an inmate by a representativeof the media shall be referred to the Regional Public Information Officer,or the Office of Public Affairs, Central Office, Washington, DC.(f) The Public Information Officer, Office of Public Affairs, Central Office,Washington, DC shall release all announcements related to changes in:(1) Bureau of Prisons policy;(2) Institutional mission;(3) Type of inmate population; or(4) Executive personnel.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-27866 Filed 11-27-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4410-05-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
