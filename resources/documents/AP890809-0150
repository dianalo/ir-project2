Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that the StateDepartment nonetheless is continuing to recommend to Americans thatthey defer non-essential travel to China.   She that the although the security situation has improved, it isstill more unsettled than before the imposition of martial law inMay.   The dependents were ordered home three days after Chinesemilitary forces routed demonstrators who had occupied TienanmenSquare in Beijing for weeks.   As part of the disturbances, Chinese troops fired their weaponsin the vicinity of a compound where diplomats and other foreignresidents live. The U.S. Embassy's chief of security said bulletsflew through a window into a room where his two children werewatching television.   The incident prompted a strong protest by the U.S. Embassy toChinese authorities. Ms. Tutwiler was unable to say whether theissue was resolved to the satisfaction of U.S. officials.   At the time, officials said the shooting appeared to come fromthe indiscriminate firing of troops who were attempting to clearChinese civilians from the streets.   The decision to send the dependents back to China contributed tothe notion that U.S.-Chinese relations are gradually normalizing.Secretary of State James A. Baker III met late last month withChina's foreign minister during a visit to Paris.   Other officials, insisting on anonymity, said virtually allother foreign dependents who were evacuated in June have sincereturned to Beijing. They also said that of the 350 Americanbusinessmen who departed China, about 150 have gone back.   The State Department urged American visitors to China to take anumber of precautions. It said Chinese authorities have seizedreligious and political materials they deem objectionable and iturged that Americans refrain from going out after dark orphotographing areas where disturbances have occurred.</TEXT></DOC>
