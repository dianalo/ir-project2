These insurers -- which offer a full line of life andhealth as well as property coverage -- had been shunned bymost investors for more than a year. The main reason:insurers' portfolios brim with real estate loans, many ofthem sour.</LP><TEXT>   But now money managers are taking a renewed interest inthe group, known as multiline insurers. In the past month,Aetna has advanced 20% to 41 1/4, Cigna has risen 21% to 561/4, and even Travelers -- whose real estate holdings aregenerally considered the most nettlesome of the big three --has risen 10%, to 20 1/4.   Even after this run-up, the stocks look inexpensive. Aetnasells for around eight times the past four quarters'per-share earnings; Cigna's multiple is 8.9, and the P-E onTravelers is a lowly six. By contrast, the averagebig-company stock these days sells for about 20 timesearnings.   Jim Melcher of Balestra Capital started buying largehelpings of Aetna in October, along with smaller amounts ofCigna. He acknowledges that the road will be bumpy: Morewrite-offs on real estate loans are likely. But Mr. Melcheris taking a long view. &quot;You salt them away and you make afortune,&quot; he says. &quot;It might take five years.&quot; He figuresoperating earnings could roughly triple in that time andreported earnings (after real estate writeoffs) could roughlydouble.   On top of that, because the stocks are selling for onlysome three to five times &quot;normalized&quot; earnings, he believestheir P-E ratios could triple. Here's the optimisticequation: If you double the earnings and triple the multiple,the stocks would be worth six times what they were worth amonth ago. Mr. Melcher says a 500% gain is &quot;possible.&quot;   Big potential gains come with risk. Real estate write-offscould be an annual agony if, as some predict, commercial realestate remains in oversupply until the end of the decade.Property-and-casualty insurance pricing is weak, with noimminent signs of a pickup. Health-insurance profits havebeen excellent, but pessimists think those earnings havepeaked.   The real estate demon worries investors most. But notevery real estate loan in the country will go bad.   Weston M. Hicks, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein wholikes Aetna and Cigna, has made what he considers somerealistic estimates. He recalls that in the great Texas realestate washout of 19861990, about 33% of most insurers' realestate loans became impaired (that is, delinquent,renegotiated, or in default). He doesn't think the nationalreal estate malaise will get that bad.   Mr. Hicks postulates that 20% of insurers' loans on officebuildings and hotels will become impaired in the 1991-95period, in addition to those that were already impaired as ofDec. 31, 1990. Some 15% of loans on retail properties such asshopping centers will turn sour, along with 10% of those onapartment buildings. Most of the damage, he assumes, willhappen this year and next.   Based on these assumptions, Mr. Hicks thinks Aetna andCigna will significantly outperform the average stock. Evenif the dollar amount of bad real estate loans turns out to be25% higher than he projects, Mr. Hicks says, he'd still be abuyer.   Another fan of full-line insurance stocks is ElaineGarzarelli, the well-known quantitative analyst for ShearsonLehman Brothers. &quot;I've just upgraded the multiline insurersin the past week&quot; after avoiding them for four years, shesays. &quot;The reason is that they are very cheap.&quot;   According to Ms. Garzarelli, the group is selling for a43% discount to the average stock, based on estimated 1992earnings. &quot;Whenever the relative P-E has been thisinexpensive, the stocks have started to move at least a yearbefore the earnings.&quot;   Shearson's favorite stock in the group is AmericanInternational Group, which deals mainly in commercialproperty-and-casualty insurance, world-wide. It sells forabout 12 times the past four quarters' earnings.   To be sure, plenty of skeptics think that buying full-lineinsurance stocks is playing with fire. &quot;I think you have toomuch euphoria,&quot; says Myron Picoult of Oppenheimer andamp; Co. &quot;Themarket's dying to play these stocks&quot; because they are cheap.But &quot;it is going to be awhile before the real estatesituation settles down.&quot; Further writeoffs, he says, will&quot;mitigate the bursts {in earnings} that people seem to belooking for.&quot;   Beyond that, Mr. Picoult thinks that insurance companyearnings -- which are nothing to write home about, for mostcompanies -- would look even more lackluster were it not forvarious sorts of reinsurance arrangements that are poorlydisclosed to investors. &quot;Some carriers have been usingfinancial reinsurance to obfuscate their operating trends,&quot;he wrote recently.   Robert Benson, a money manager with the Pioneer family ofmutual funds in Boston, wants no part of the stocks either.For full-line insurers, &quot;it's hard to get all cylindersfiring at the same time,&quot; he says. &quot;Time and time again asone division goes up the other goes down.&quot; He predicts Cignawill stay in a trading range of 40 to 60.   &quot;If you felt confident that commercial real estate hasbottomed,&quot; Travelers might deserve a look, Mr. Benson says,as it is the most depressed. But he hasn't any suchconfidence. He prefers Chubb, a property-and-casualty insurerwhose earnings Mr. Benson describes as erratic, but withsuccessively higher peaks.   More optimistic on real estate is Chris Bertelsen, aBoston money manager who runs the $366 million Colonial Fund.He is holding on to his Aetna and Cigna, though he has a losson both and plans to sell some other losers for tax reasons,to offset gains.   &quot;I'm looking for losses, but Cigna isn't going to be oneof them, nor Aetna,&quot; he says. He likes their &quot;handsomedividend yields,&quot; 5.4% for Cigna, 6.6% for Aetna.   As for real estate, annual rents on Boston buildings thatwere $43 to $45 a square foot three or four years ago haveplunged to $26 or less a square foot, he says. This drop, hesays, is already pretty much &quot;factored into the prices&quot; ofthe stocks. Mr. Bertelsen doesn't believe rents will fallmuch further: &quot;I think we're pretty much over the bridge onreal estate.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
