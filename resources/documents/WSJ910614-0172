The documents were filed in connection with a suit filedin federal district court in Miami by a Lloyd's of Londonunderwriting syndicate.

At a hearing today in the Miami court, Judge LinneaJohnson is expected to review requests for the production ofsubstantial BCCI documentation relevant to the case, whichcould help to unravel some of the mysteries surrounding thetroubled Luxembourg international bank and its operations inthe U.S.   On June 3, Judge Johnson signed an order compelling Bankof Credit andamp; Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd., a unit ofBCCI Holdings, to produce extensive records from its NewYork, Miami, Tampa and Boca Raton, Fla., offices. In April,Judge Johnson issued an order requiring preservation of BCCIdocuments within the U.S.   Today's hearing also is expected to review demands for thereturn of Munther Bilbeisi to the U.S. from Amman, Jordan,where he is understood to be residing. Mr. Bilbeisi, a coffeetrader, used the BCCI unit as his bank for trading activitiesin coffee and military equipment, according to court papers.Mr. Bilbeisi, in affidavits, has denied he is an arms dealer.His lawyer in the U.S. couldn't be reached for comment.   According to the Lloyd's suit, Mr. Bilbeisi allegedlyfiled more than $3 million of fraudulent insurance claims forcoffee shipments and losses in an alleged burglary. The suitnames as defendants Mr. Bilbeisi, Orion Systems Inc., CoffeeInc., Mura International S.A., Bank of Credit andamp; CommerceInternational (Overseas), and several other companies andindividuals. Coffee Inc., Orion and Mura are owned orcontrolled by Mr. Bilbeisi.   Mr. Bilbeisi, through a company based in Boca Raton, alsotried to sell as much as $34 million of military equipmentthrough Jordan -- including jet fighters from Northrop Corp.and helicopters from United Technologies Corp.'s SikorskyAircraft division -- to the Guatemalan government, accordingto pretrial testimony.   The military aircraft mentioned in the court papers wereoriginally destined for Jordan, and there was no U.S.government approval for their shipment to Guatemala. Suchapproval is required for the shipment of sophisticatedmilitary equipment.   Early last year, BCCI pleaded guilty to money-launderingin federal court in Tampa.
