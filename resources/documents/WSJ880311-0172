The essence of magic, disinformation and diplomacy is misdirection. A good negotiator, like a good magician, relies on misdirection to obtain his desires. And when the opposition is eager to obtain an agreement to practically anything at all and is a politician totally ignorant of modern technology, it is pathetically easy to get him to agree to crippling disadvantages that he doesn't even imagine exist.    Like good magicians, the Soviets and their surrogates raise our false concerns about moving SS-20 warheads to SS-25 rockets and thus achieving no reduction in megatonnage, merely a modernization of their delivery systems. But like any good disinformation, this concern is just an illusion.    Although the INF agreement is titled &quot;Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces,&quot; the important provision is not about nuclear forces at all. &quot;Nuclear&quot; is the distractor.    After all, the Soviets are neither stupid nor insane. They have given up nothing at all, and have gained some advantage in a nuclear war that neither they nor we will ever fight. The nuclear exchange is trivial, however, and is merely the decoy. The real objective is the agreement to ban all cruise missiles having ranges between 300 miles and 3,300 miles, which are capable of carrying nuclear warheads.    Now, anything at all that flies is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, because modern technology has made bombs so small. A three-kiloton atomic bomb can be packaged to fit in an artillery shell. Not a special gun, like the now obsolete atomic cannon, but ordinary guns like the eight-inch howitzer and perhaps even the ubiquitous 155-millimeter cannon. I do recall speculation some years ago that a terrorist could carry a 25-pound atom bomb in a suitcase.    The INF treaty bans not only missiles, but anything that flies, has no pilot, and can fly between 300 and 3,300 miles. These are precisely the weapons that could stop a Soviet invasion of Western Europe in a few days, with very few losses on our side. And the Pentagon takes the INF prohibition seriously enough to have a very restrictive effect on U.S. development of these devices. (Other countries are not so inhibited.)    The basic scenario is outlined in my article &quot;The Offensive Defense&quot; in the July 1987 issue of Defense Science and Electronics. The message is that a few tens of thousands of armed UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), each costing perhaps a thousandth of the cost of an Advanced Tactical Fighter or a B-2, could force an invading Soviet army into total gridlock. Each of the UAVs would typically carry a few dozen offensive weapons capable of destroying trucks, trains, helicopters, airplanes and radars -- all the infrastructure of a modern army. The ATF boosters claim that a $50 million fighter, with full support, is needed to penetrate Soviet defenses to destroy enemy airfields. But the airfields can be denied to the enemy for days by a $50,000 drone, dumping 500 pounds of explosive gravel on the runway and then crashing into anything convenient.    The designs are there, far more sophisticated, yet simpler, than the Cessna that Matthias Rust flew unchallenged into Moscow. The weapons exist, the sensors exist, the tactics exist, not only to cause gridlock in Poland, but also sanity in Iran and moderation in Moscow. What is lacking is understanding in Washington of what can be done and the will to work for the survival of civilization, not for the deepening of troughs. Si vis pacem, para bellum.
