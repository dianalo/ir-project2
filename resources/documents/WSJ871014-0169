FINANCIERE DE PARIBAS, said it plans to acquire a 100% stake in the Paris brokerage COURCOUX, BOUVET S.A. in a widely expected move aimed at developing its presence in French stock trading.    Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed, but officials indicated the price was between 10 and 15 times earnings, roughly the average for the six firms that have been acquired previously in the run-up to next year's planned deregulation of the French market.    Based on Courcoux Bouvet's 1986 earnings of 35 million French francs ($5.8 million), that would imply a price of between 350 million francs and 525 million francs ($57.7 million to $86.3 million). Analysts said they thought that the price tag for Courcoux Bouvet would be about 450 million francs.    Courcoux Bouvet is France's fourth-largest brokerage in terms of 1986 results. The firm is also one of the most profitable in Paris, as its 1986 net income represented 21% of its 165.3 million-franc revenue and its 82-person work force ranked it only 29th among Paris brokerages in terms of personnel.    The firm's high profit margins partly reflect its leading position in block trades for institutions.    The recent rash of brokerage acquisitions is likely to continue in anticipation of the deregulation, and brokers say most of the existing brokerages eventually will likely be bought by larger groups. </TEXT></DOC>
