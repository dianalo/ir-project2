Dan Rostenkowski agreed to appear withDemocratic leaders tomorrow when they call for a middle-classtax cut, but the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and MeansCommittee doesn't appear any closer to producing thenecessary legislation.   The Illinois Democrat, who has repeatedly said he doesn'twant any major tax bills this year, hasn't seen his fellowDemocrats' proposals. &quot;It's going to be as much news to me asit is to you,&quot; he told a reporter yesterday.</LP><TEXT>   While he also said there might be a bill in October,senior aides said he's unlikely to push any bill through thecommittee this year, contrary to a comment from House SpeakerThomas Foley (D., Wash.). Indeed, Rep. Thomas Downey (D.,N.Y.), a committee member, said, &quot;I talked to the chairmanyesterday, and he said there would be no tax bill this year.&quot;   Still, it's important to the Democrats to get Rep.Rostenkowski on the platform when they talk about tax cuts.The House and Senate Democratic leaders are set to announcewhat they consider an anti-recession package today, includingnot only a tax cut but also increased highway spending andexpanded unemployment compensation. There are likely to befew specifics and little new in what they announce, but theDemocrats hope to show the party has an anti-recessionagenda.</TEXT></DOC>
