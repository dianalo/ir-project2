The National Transportation Safety Board recommended thatConsolidated Rail Corp. and other railroads look for ways to changework cycles that put crewmen on trains without adequate sleep.   The board said the Jan. 14, 1988, collision at Thompsontownoccurred because the engineer and brakeman of a 105-car coal trainwere asleep. It was made worse, the board said, because the engineerof the other train did not slow down quickly enough and acomputer-based traffic control system was not working properly.Damage in the crash was estimated at $6 million.   The report said none of the men on the coal train, which was enroute from Baltimore to Altoona, Pa., had had more than two hourssleep in the previous 22 to 24 hours, and they had not eaten in over13 hours. The men had reported for work at 11:30 p.m. and the crashwas at 7:45 a.m. the next day.   Conrail spokeswoman Pat Linsky said the company could not commentin detail until officials had reviewed the board report. But therailroad issued a statement saying that the engineer and brakeman onthe coal train had signed off their previous runs 37.5 hours earlierand the conductor 50 hours before boarding the Baltimore-Altoonatrain.   ``The probable cause of this accident was the sleep-deprivedcondition of the engineer and other crewmembers of train UBT-506,which resulted in their inability to stay awake and alert,'' theboard said. It said the engineer did not attempt to stop the trainafter warning signals went off and suggested he may have pushed apedal in his sleep that acknowledged the warning but deactivatedautomatic braking of the train.   Drug tests on the four dead crewmen and two conductors whosurvived the crash were negative for use of alcohol or illicitdrugs, except for a minuscule indication of marijuana in oneconductor's urine.   The board said the railroad industry has long had unpredictablework schedules but the problem has worsened with the elimination ofmany regularly scheduled freight and passenger trains, a cutback inyard operations, agreements protecting employee seniority, longerfreight runs and relocations of work assignments.</TEXT></DOC>
