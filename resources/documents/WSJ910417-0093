The excuses of the Bush administration include thereasoning that the rebels will succeed only in splinteringIraq and stirring up Arab opposition, that once the rebelsare crushed Saddam Hussein's own regime will remove him, andthat the American people have no stomach for further militaryoperations against Iraq.   The U.S. just fought a war to reverse the annexation ofKuwait by Iraq, and now the excuse given not to fight is toprevent the opposite, the splintering of Iraq. I wonder ifthe Bush administration has considered the advantages of sucha splintering. If a small part became a friendly Kurdistan,that might be greatly advantageous to the West -- especiallysince Kurdistan contains large oil reserves. It is in theinterests of the U.S. to have several small democracies inthe area, rather than one large, totalitarian, aggressivecountry that preys on its neighbors.</LP><TEXT>   The argument that Arab opposition will be stirred upignores the aspirations of Arabs in the area. The Iranians,Syrians, Saudis and Egyptians all want Saddam overthrown.Kuwaitis who have opposed the U.S. in the past now considerAmericans heroes. If the U.S. rescued the Kurds, the Kurdsundoubtedly would share the same feelings as the Kuwaitis nowhave toward the U.S.   The calculation that once Hussein's armies crush therebels his own regime will remove him ignores the fact thathis own regime is helping him crush the rebels. It is on hisside. It is the rebels who would remove Hussein but once theyare crushed they won't be able to do that.   The excuse given by a &quot;senior official&quot; that &quot;theAmericans have no stomach for a major military operation todictate the outcome of a political struggle in Iraq&quot; is noexcuse for allowing Iraqi helicopters to gun down the Kurdsor any other part of the Iraqi population. It would not evenbe necessary to take out Iraqi helicopter gunships if Mr.Bush had accepted Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf's recommendation tocontinue to march into Iraq when the Iraqi forces wererouted. If Mr. Bush had carried out this advice, Saddam'sarmies would have been unable to massacre their own peopleand a new democratic Iraq could have emerged.   Gamaliel Isaac   Irvington, N.Y.   ---   It was not so long ago that Mr. Bush was calling SaddamHussein an &quot;Adolf Hitler,&quot; and saying that he hoped the Iraqipeople would rise up and &quot;take care of him.&quot; The worldwatches the Kurds and Shiites attempt a revolt, and thenrecoils in horror at Mr. Bush's lack of support. The rebelsare being slaughtered by Saddam's helicopter gunships and hisRepublican Guard -- the same army Mr. Bush allowed to escapefrom Gen. Schwarzkopf's successful campaign.   Why is Mr. Bush suddenly paralyzed and indecisive? Did hedecide the new Hitler isn't so bad after all, consideringthat the alternative might be a pluralistic, democraticsociety, with Kurds and Shiites having local control overtheir own homelands? Did he decide to pull the troops outbecause they accomplished his primary objective -- to securedefense funding at Cold War levels, in spite of thedissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet threat? Or doeshe most fear another successful Schwarzkopf campaign, onethat might then conclude with the general stormin' thepresidency in '92?   Bruce A. Joffee   Piedmont, Calif.   ---   What we are witnessing in Iraq is no longer aninsurrection nor a civil war promoted by President Bush(&quot;What's the Point?&quot; Review andamp; Outlook, April 4). It is aholocaust. We have seen Saddam Hussein's malevolence in thekilling, torture and destruction in Kuwait as he was forcedto withdraw. He will continue for years to punish dissidentminorities for his humiliating defeat. Having intervened inthe region to redress injustices, we cannot remain neutralwhile this slaughter continues.
