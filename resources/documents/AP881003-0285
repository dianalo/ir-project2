They train, with varying intensity,as auxiliaries to the National Guard to deal with emergencies athome in the event the Guard is called to federal duty. They're theState Defense Forces, ``one of the nation's best-kept militarysecrets,'' in one insider's words.   ___</NOTE><BYLINE>By DAVID L. LANGFORD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Volunteer armies are forming to guard the home front, patriotsdrilling without pay and often buying their own uniforms in thetradition of the minuteman militias of the American colonies.   Pancho Villa first signaled the need, but that's history, too.   Today's militias train as auxiliaries to National Guard unitsthat are expected to be on the battlefield within days followingthe outbreak of war under the Pentagon's Total Force defensedoctrine.   To fill the void left when the guardsmen are gone, almost halfthe states over the last few years have organized State DefenseForces _ sometimes called the State Guard, State Defense Corps orState Military Reserve _ with about 10,000 members all told andwith widely varying strengths and capabilities.   It's not unlike the Home Guard of World War I and the StateGuard of World War II.   ``State Defense Forces are one of the best-kept military secretsin our nation,'' says Jerry Fogel, executive director of the StateDefense Force Association of the United States, a 1,000-memberorganization based in Kansas City, Mo., that was formed four yearsago as the state militia program was growing.   Some of the State Defense Forces are little more than socialclubs, some are serious military organizations. At least one wasdisbanded by state authorities because its leaders insisted oncamouflage uniforms and Rambo-style training, including parachutejumps.   The uniforms of these citizen-soldiers, most of whom are retiredfrom the military, range from hand-me-down fatigues to dress bluespurchased at their own expense. Tuxedos adorned with insignia andcampaign ribbons have been recommended for social occasions.   The militiamen's primary job is more that of policemen or rescueworkers than soldiers. In the absence of the National Guard, theywould be called on to help out in emergencies such as hurricanes,fires, floods and civil disturbances, assisting local policedepartments, civil defense and disaster relief agencies. But shouldthe United States be threatened by invasion, they would also beneeded to guard strategic installations, hydroelectric dams, watertreatment plants, communications facilities.   Each State Defense Force is controlled by the state governor andhis adjutant general, the state's top military officer. Unlike theNational Guard, which is 95 percent federally funded, they get nomoney and little else _ except advice _ from Washington. That maychange.   The National Guard Bureau, the Guard's liaison with thePentagon, has formed a committee to recommend some guidelines fororganization of the State Defense Forces, dealing with such thingsas training, who can be a member, what uniform they should wear andwhether they should be armed.   In most states the militia is trained to function as a militarypolice force, focusing on such things as traffic and crowd control,search and rescue and communications. Others undergo more vigorouscombat training, which the National Guard Bureau opposes. The StateDefense Force is not part of the National Guard but both are underthe control of the individual state adjutants general and oftenshare the same armories.   George J. Stein, a professor at Miami University in Oxford,Ohio, and an authority on military reserves, wrote in MilitaryReview magazine that attempts to train the militias as potentialcombat forces ``are a waste of time.''   While Stein believes there is a need for militias in aconstabulary role, he says, ``It is difficult to guess whethernostalgia or fantasy underlies the desire of some members ... toget out into the woods with a map and compass, play combat infantrysoldier and prepare to repel a parachute invasion from over theNorth Pole.''   But the states may do as they wish and any attempt by thefederal bureacracy to interfere raises the hackles of some stateofficials.   ``That which they don't fund, they sure as hell ain't going tocontrol,'' says Maj. Gen. Carl Wallace, adjutant general ofTennessee, the Volunteer State.   But Wallace strongly believes in the need for a State DefenseForce.   ``We realized in late 1979 or '80 that Tennessee would be in badshape if all at once Guard units were mobilized and taken out ofthe state,'' he says. ``We'd have equipment and armories across thestate that could not be protected.''   The Tennessee Defense Force has 840 volunteers, including 15women, and is organized in four brigades across the state. Membersmust be between the ages of 17 to 70 and include doctors, lawyers,preachers and even a country music singer, Grand Ole Opry regularCharlie Walker, a World War II veteran who is a lieutenant colonel.   The members wear regular Army uniforms, which they buythemselves, with distinguishing name tags and brass. They don'tcarry arms and there are no requirements for special training ormeetings. Most units get together about once a month.   ``It's a combination of a ceremonial and social club,'' Wallacesays. ``They're not getting paid, but they're interested. They liketo put on a uniform.''   The Texas State Guard, on the other hand, requires eachguardsman to undergo at least 96 hours of training a year. Localcommanders can, and do, require up to six times as much, accordingto Col. Tom Williams, the director of the Guard.   With units in 123 communities _ including nine military policegroups who are trained as MPs for guard duty, traffic and crowdcontrol, security and search and rescue _ the Texas State Guard hassigned up only 1,230 of the 3,036 troops it is authorized.   ``It's tough to get people to work for nothing,'' Williams says.   The militiamen do get paid when called to active duty by thegovernor, such as the 34 called up when Hurricane Gilbert hit thecoast in September.   The Texas militiamen are armed with riot-control shotguns andnight sticks and wear green fatigues. There is a full-time staff ofthree, including Williams.   The New York Guard has a cadre of 615 volunteers but says itcould mobilize up to 18,000 if the National Guard were called up.They train with pistols, shotguns and rifles and hold weekly drillsat National Guard armories. One day a month, on a weekend, there isdaylong classroom instruction. A weeklong training program is heldonce a year, but attendance is not mandatory.   With an annual budget of about $100,000, the New York Guard hastwo full-time administrators _ a deputy chief of staff and hissecretary. Members buy their own uniforms but get limitedreimbursements for military expenses.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
