By keeping pricesbelow market-clearing levels, it helped create a growing demand for naturalgas. With the passage of the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA) in 1978, atransition began from a government-controlled environment to one in whichmarket forces dominated. That transition is largely complete. Now, althoughthe government may regulate particular transactions, free-market competitionwill largely determine the average price at which natural gas is sold.But government policy has not lost its importance for the natural gasindustry. Both Congress and federal and state regulators will continueto influence the efficiency with which the gas market operates, its structure,and which firms will prosper or suffer in the new market environment.By action or inaction, they will determine whether consumers receivethe full benefits of increased competition.</TEXT></DOC>
