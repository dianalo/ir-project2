In previoustests this material(CE 339, made by Ferro Corp.) has shown good vacuumproperties and has also demonstrated the capability to withstand highenergy electron beams in tests at the Naval Research Laboratory. Basedon these promising results, the Torsatron Group at Auburn Universityconducted plasma exposure tests on a section of carbon fiber/epoxy compositepipe furnished by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 1 ref, 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
