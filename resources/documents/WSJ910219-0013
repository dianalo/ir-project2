Other analysts' views of profits inthe final three months of last year range from&quot;disappointing&quot; to &quot;no good&quot; to &quot;lousy.&quot;   There are, however, lots of ways to look at profits. Mr.Heinemann and the other analysts are looking mainly atoperating profits, which indeed weakened substantially. If ithadn't been for the big losses that General Motors and Fordreported late last week, however, the earnings posted forstockholders would have been little changed from a yearearlier. Reported earnings were bolstered by inventoryprofits and by comparison with a weak 1989 quarter when banksand industrial companies took large earnings writeoffs.</LP><TEXT>   All that is by way of leading up to the fact that in theOctober-December period net income of 617 major corporationsfell 9% from a year earlier, a Wall Street Journal surveyfinds. After-tax earnings from continuing operations dropped4% in the fourth quarter.   Profits in the current quarter are almost certain to fallfrom a year ago, if only because of a strong quarter in 1990,when net income rose 10% from a year earlier. In addition,inventory profits will largely disappear if oil prices remainsteady around current levels.   What happens to oil prices -- and the general economy --depends to a large extent on what happens to the Persian Gulfwar. &quot;If it's a protracted war, profits are likely to remaindepressed,&quot; said Lynn Reaser, senior economist at FirstInterstate Bank of Los Angeles. &quot;If the war ends fairly soon,we could start looking at better corporate profits as earlyas this spring.&quot;   Mickey D. Levy, chief economist of CRT GovernmentSecurities, says, &quot;corporations have gone a long way towardeliminating the excesses of the 1980s. Unit labor costs aredown, helping to set the stage for a profits recovery.&quot;Federal Reserve moves to cut interest rates are also helpingto cut corporate interest costs.   The biggest question on profits, however, is the outlookfor the economy. The 52 economists interviewed monthly byBlue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter,on the average now look for the inflation-adjusted grossnational product to decline by 1.3% in the current quarterand then start a modest recovery in the April-June period.However, they still expect the full year to show a profitsdecline.   Among major groups, fourth-quarter earnings improved foroil companies and securities firms, though the latter stilldid poorly. Auto, steel, banking and aerospace companiesposted either lower earnings or collective deficits.   As bad as the fourth quarter was for the Big Three U.S.auto makers, the current quarter could be even worse.   With consumer demand for new cars and trucks atrecessionary levels in the U.S. and slumping in many Europeancountries, the Big Three face the worst crunch since theearly 1980s. All three companies are scrambling to cutinventories and costs -- slashing production schedules tolevels not seen since 1982, jettisoning thousands ofwhite-collar jobs and squeezing suppliers to cut prices forparts. Even so, General Motors and Ford are expected to postbig losses in the current quarter for the second three-monthperiod in a row. Chrysler, which was marginally profitableduring the last three months of 1990, has signaled it willtake a big charge in the first quarter on top of expectedoperating losses.   Steel companies, bruised by lower prices and slack demandin the auto, appliance and construction markets, reported adismal fourth quarter. And the outlook for the first quarteris even worse, given a tentative agreement between thenation's largest steelmaker, USX, and the United Steelworkersunion. Competitors had hoped a strike would tighten themarket, but are now faced with USX's selling off inventoryaccumulated in anticipation of a strike.   Earnings at most major steelmakers were dragged down notonly by weak pricing and demand, but by special charges.Bethlehem Steel posted a $550 million charge to restructureits rail and structural steel business in preparation for aproposed venture with British Steel. Armco, LTV and InlandSteel Industries all reported losses, reversing profits inthe 1989 period.   For banks, big provisions for expected losses oncommercial real estate loans took a heavy toll on earnings,particularly at East Coast institutions. But banks thatavoided real estate disasters generally benefited fromfalling interest rates and reported higher profits. Citicorp,the nation's largest banking company, set aside a $979million loan-loss provision and took a $300 millionrestructuring charge. A year earlier, Citicorp's provisionwas $1.43 billion, including $1 billion for loans toless-developed countries.   Security Pacific had a $624 million loan-loss provisionand took $282 million of restructuring charges andwrite-downs; a year earlier, it had only a $210 millionloan-loss provision. At Manufacturers Hanover, the loan-lossprovision more than doubled, to $353 million from $172million.   Securities brokers, battered by sinking revenue fromcommissions, underwriting and investment banking, reportedone of their worst quarters since the 1987 stock marketcrash. The weak results gave brokerage firms their poorestprofit year since 1974.   PaineWebber Group's loss reflects $95 million inrestructuring charges for layoffs and troubled &quot;bridge&quot;loans. In contrast, Merrill Lynch's earnings were aturnaround from the unprofitable year-earlier period, whenthe company took a large restructuring charge. Salomon'sdeficit was triggered partly by bond-trading losses at itsSalomon Brothers securities unit.   But stock trading volume and some investment bankingactivity have picked up in the first quarter. That has ledsome industry analysts to recommend shares of brokeragecompanies, including Merrill Lynch, A.G. Edwards and BearStearns.   Profits soared at most oil companies as a result ofsharply higher crude oil prices stemming from the PersianGulf crisis. Earnings from the exploration and productionbusinesses of these companies skyrocketed on concern that awar in the Middle East might cut off oil output from thatpart of the world. The gains from this sector more thanoffset the weak results of the companies' refining andmarketing business as well as chemical business. Exxon,Mobil, Texaco, Chevron and other integrated oil companieswere big winners. However, oil companies without anoil-producing unit suffered from the run-up in crude prices.   But industry experts say the recent decline in crude oilprices makes it unlikely that the sharp quarterly increase inprofits enjoyed by most big oil companies will be repeated.In fact, Chevron Chairman Kenneth Derr labeled the industry'squarterly results &quot;an aberration.&quot; Indeed, oil prices whichhad at one point jumped to more than $40 a barrel followingIraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, declined once it becameclear that the war wasn't jeopardizing Saudi output.   The huge write-downs that plagued defense contractors ayear ago revisited the industry in the fourth quarter. ThePentagon's cancellation last month of the Navy A-12 attackplane forced contractors McDonnell Douglas and GeneralDynamics to take huge charges on the program. McDonnell wroteoff $219 million on the A-12, and General Dynamics wound uptaking the biggest charge in its history -- $566.9 million --which included increased reserves against the A-12, losses onthe company's commercial rocket business and variousrestructuring charges.   Boeing, enjoying continued increases in its commercialaircraft business, quadrupled its earnings, in part becauseyear-earlier results were hurt by the seven-week walkout ofits hourly workers. While not a major factor, the PersianGulf conflict benefited some companies, as the Pentagonspeeded up orders for certain military hardware, especiallyelectronics. Analysts are projecting modest increases inprofits for most companies in the current quarter, and don'texpect to see any big charges. But the outlook for the groupis less upbeat long term. &quot;With a decreased defense budgetbeing proposed by the administration, I think you will see acontinued downtrend in earnings,&quot; says Jerry Cantwell ofWertheim Schroder.   Here are the fourth-quarter profits for various industrygroups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter. Whenindividual companies report for three-month periods otherthan calendar quarters, the nearest comparable periods areused.

Despite reasonably lean inventoriesand promising growth overseas, the first quarter should beeven worse for aluminum makers, as domestic demand remainsweak. Aluminum Co. of America posted a net loss because of a$275 million charge for environmental clean-up andwrite-downs of non-aluminum businesses. Reynolds Metals tooka similar $93.9 million cleanup charge. Even without theitems, operating earnings were down 16% at Alcoa and 19% atReynolds.   Metals and mining companies suffered from lower lead,zinc, silver and gold prices, although some gold companies,notably Newmont, realized higher gold prices through hedgingand gold loan programs. Copper company operating earningsrose on slightly higher copper prices for the quarter, butcharges and operating problems cut earnings for somecompanies. Asarco took a $51.5 million after-tax charge forenvironmental cleanup costs and Cyprus took a $40 millionafter-tax charge for the write-down of a molybdenum mine itplans to close. Phelps Dodge earnings rose in part becauseyear-ago earnings reflected a $237 million after-tax chargefor mine and equipment write-downs. Magma Copper's earningsrose on substantial improvements in productivity and lowercosts.   Lumber and paper companies saw earnings chopped down asthe construction slump and weak prices for paper andpackaging products persisted. Several big companies hadunusual restructuring charges or write-downs in the period,many reflecting adjustments the entire industry is undergoingas a result of weak demand, environmental challenges andother factors. Mead's loss, for example, included $107.2million of write-downs and nonrecurring charges related tovarious restructuring moves. Weyerhaeuser's year-earlierresults included $270.4 million of restructuring charges. Theindustry will be out on a limb as long as the constructionslump lingers, and few analysts see a rebound soon.   Chemical makers continued to suffer from a double dose ofadverse war-related industry conditions and the weakeningeconomy. Costs for petroleum-based raw materials remain high,while growing market capacity for petrochemical products suchas bulk plastics makes it difficult to pass higher prices onto customers. Diversity helped some chemical companiespartially offset losses in core businesses. Aided by aprofits surge from its Conoco oil unit, Du Pont, the nation'slargest chemical maker, reported only a slight drop in netearnings. Strong European business also helped soften theeffects of the weak U.S. economy. At Monsanto, sharply higherearnings in pharmaceuticals and food sweeteners didn't offsetresults of the ailing chemical unit. Union Carbide sufferedthe most severe drop of major chemical makers. Even Rohm andamp;Haas wasn't sanguine about its strong profit rise. Itattributed the growth to improved plant operations and strongEuropean currencies and noted that results reflected more apoor year-earlier quarter; it warned that its outlook, aswith the industry, is &quot;murky.&quot;                                                                                                                                                                                                                 METALS                                                                                                          -- STEEL                                                                                                                                        4th Qtr.   4th Qtr.    %   6 Firms                         1990       1989     Chg                                                                                                          Allegheny Ludlum               6,079     28,641     -79   Armco Inc                     -8,500     15,500     ...

Drilling companies also benefited. ForRowan Cos., the fourth quarter was the first profitable onefor its drilling division in more than five years. But theimpact the war may have on oil prices makes this quarterdifficult to predict. Global Marine says the Persian Gulfcrisis hasn't &quot;appreciably affected&quot; its results but believesoil prices are likely to be well below recent highs when thewar is over.   Natural gas pipeline companies generally had a flatquarter based on operations because of weak demand stemmingfrom warmer-than-normal weather and the slowing economy.One-time items and income from some pipeline companies' otheroperations resulted in varied performances in the quarter.Panhandle's huge loss included $280 million of charges,mostly for the write-down of the company's liquefied naturalgas facilities.

Conrail's improvement partly reflected cost-cutting;without a restructuring charge, Conrail's fourth-quarter 1989net would have been $66 million. Analysts forecastfirst-quarter traffic and earnings declines for most railcompanies.   Trucking-company earnings improved, reflecting the end ofthe rate war that badgered year-earlier results. Ratescontinue to hold firm, but freight tonnage has been weakeningsince December. Some analysts predict flattened first-quarterearnings for the group.   Big air-freight companies were hurt by increased fuelcosts and slumping demand. Fuel will probably create less ofa pinch in the first quarter, but lackluster volume shouldkeep earnings down.   Among marine transporters, American President benefitedfrom cost-cutting measures and U.S. export gains, includingcargo transported for the Gulf war.   The long slump in the truck-making business deepened. Thefourth-quarter loss at Cummins included a charge of $65.3million, to, among other things, dispose of some operationsand discontinue an engine line. Year-ago net at Paccarincluded a gain of $52.4 million from the sale of a divisionand a fleet of rail cars. In 1991, industry sales of heavyand medium trucks are expected to be below last year'sdepressed levels. Cummins, a maker of engines, and Navistar,a maker of trucks, announced plans to cut employment further.But both still expect a first-quarter loss. A rare brightspot: Trinity Industries reported increased business in thelatest quarter for rail cars.   Heavy machinery companies that entered the quarteruncertain about the outlook emerged with a clearer view ofthe future: tough times are ahead. The slump in constructionequipment continued. Making matters worse, Caterpillar andClark Equipment were hit hard by deepened economic turmoil inBrazil, where the government continued an uphill battleagainst spiraling inflation. Many companies expect earningsto fall in 1991, with perhaps the biggest decline in thefirst quarter. With farmers holding off on equipmentpurchases and sharp cutbacks at its factories, Deere expectsa first-quarter loss for its equipment operations.

Demand is off because of a sustained erosion in consumerconfidence brought on by the recessionary economy and thePersian Gulf conflict, they said. For what little demand hasremained, builders have had great difficulty obtainingfinancing from banks and thrifts under pressure to reducereal estate portfolios.   The capital constraints, however, bode well for the futureof much of the industry because they will hold down supply asthe demand curve begins to rise, as expected, later thisyear. Builders with access to capital, therefore, will beable to respond to the improving demand, Kidder, Peabodyanalyst Barbara Allen said in her recommendation to buy homebuilding stocks.   Many retailers, hurt by weak sales in the crucialChristmas selling season, are expected to report earningsdeclines for the January quarter. And the outlook for thefiscal first quarter is even worse. Sears Roebuck, whichoperates on a calendar year and has financial service units,took a $155.2 million charge to restructure its falteringmerchandise group; its core U.S. stores and catalogs hadtheir worst showing in years.   Kmart, citing sluggish apparel sales and extensivediscounting during the holiday period, has warned that itsearnings will be below year-earlier levels. Lower profits arealso expected at J.C. Penney, which started the Christmasseason with too much inventory, and Carter Hawley HaleStores, which filed for bankruptcy court protection lastweek. Dayton Hudson and May Department Stores are likely toreport lower earnings too, while earnings are expected to beflat at Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and Woolworth.   But some chains are expected to buck the recessionarytrend, partly by emphasizing good values and low prices.Wal-Mart, which is lowering prices to grab market share whileopening new discount outlets, is expected to post higherprofit. Earnings gains are also forecast for DillardDepartment Stores and Nordstrom, which was pinched in late1989 by heavy markdowns, as well as Gap and Limited.   The lodging and casino industries reported mixed resultsin the normally slow fourth quarter. The Middle East crisisand the recession damped business for both groups, whichcontinue to suffer from industrywide overcapacity. HiltonHotels' ongoing weakness in the hotel group contrasted withsharply improved results at its Nevada casinos. Promus'sslightly improved casino operating results were offset bypretax charges, while Aztar also managed to post improvedoperating results. Circus Circus Enterprises' results wereboosted substantially by its major Las Vegas resort openedlast June. Daniel Lee, an analyst with First Boston, said heexpects the current quarter's results to be relatively weakbecause of the Gulf war and the resulting drop in consumerconfidence affecting all areas of travel and tourism.   Price competition and slower consumer spending continuedto hurt the restaurant industry. Earnings at McDonald's wereslightly below most analysts' expectations. McDonald's said1991 will be a &quot;tougher&quot; year domestically because of thesluggish economy and competitive pressures. TCBY earningswere hurt by new competition from McDonald's and Dairy Queen,which have added frozen yogurt to their menus, as well as byexpansion at other chains.   Although Walt Disney's film and TV businesses weren't hurtby recession, its larger theme park area was, as softeningtourism caused earnings to drop slightly in the quarter.Analysts expect the war to continue to erode resort activity.   Paramount Communications' net in come plunged, but theyear-earlier quarter contained a $1.2 billion gain from assetsales.   Mattel enjoyed a strong quarter in spite of a slowChristmas season for the industry and trouble at toyretailers. Toy sales have been flat for four years, andmanufacturers can only hope they'll strike paydirt with a hittoy.   Outboard Marine's losses grew as the recreational boatingindustry continued to suffer. The recession visited thepleasure boat business early, in 1989, so the industry hasbeen able to get a head-start on cost-cutting andinventory-slashing.   Polaroid's earnings exceeded analysts' estimates, buoyedby strong U.S. sales. Eastman Kodak's 1989 results included a$322 million restructuring charge. Kodak's informationsystems unit continued to struggle, but its core imagingbusiness saw world-wide gains.   In the media sector, television networks were reeling froman advertising decline and losses on sports programmingcontracts. CBS's weakness stemmed from heavy losses on thefirst year of its four-year, $1 billion Major League Baseballcontract. Capital Cities/ABC cited the ad slump, too, butalso the escalating news costs related to covering the war inthe Persian Gulf.   The ad slump affecting newspapers deepened in the quarter,and that led to expected poor results for mostnewspaper-based media companies. Gannett, the country'slargest newspaper publisher, reported its first yearly dropin earnings since it went public 23 years ago. With theoutside chance of improving economic factors in the secondhalf of 1991, newspapers expect slightly better results, atmost.   Newspaper companies that own TV stations, such as TribuneCo. and Washington Post, also have faced slumping ad demandin local TV markets.   The fourth quarter was the airline industry's worst periodin its history. The biggest culprits were high fuel pricesand a drop in traffic -- both results of the Iraqi invasionof Kuwait.

Despite theonset of recession, many rolled up hefty sales and earningsgains.   Campbell attributed its performance to soup sales andsharp increases in European profits. ConAgra's recentBeatrice foods acquisition helped fuel its improvement, withfrozen foods recording double-digit volume growth. Kelloggbounced back from a lackluster previous quarter as itstabilized domestic results and reaped continued sales gainsabroad. General Mills reported good volume increases incereals and its Betty Crocker line. Gerber's child apparelline sales were down but margins, and profits, soared. Thecompany reported moderate baby-food volume growth. Tyson, thechicken company, attributed its healthy gain to gross marginimprovement and lower interest costs.   While the recession slowed same-store sales growth, mostmajor food retailers managed to maintain profits in the lastquarter. And while the recession has taken a bite out ofsales in the Northeast and, more recently, California, it hasyet to eat away at supermarket revenue in other parts of thecountry, analysts said.   Most East Coast chains reported improvements incomparable-store sales of 2% or less, compared with 4% to 7%six months earlier.   &quot;In general, the outlook is relatively upbeat,&quot; saidKimberly K. Walin, food retailing analyst with ShearsonLehman Hutton, who predicted some continued sales softness,especially in recession-racked regions, but relative earningsstrength for the next several quarters.   The big beverage companies reported mostly higher earningson strong gains in sales. Coca-Cola, which generates about80% of its operating profit from international business,benefited from a U.S. dollar that was about 5% weaker lastyear than in 1989. Case sales in the quarter increased 9.5%overseas. Earnings fell, however, because of a gain of $509.4million in the year-earlier period on the sale of ColumbiaPictures. Anheuser-Busch attributed a 16% gain infourth-quarter sales to last year's introduction of its BudDry Draft and Busch Light brands. At Pepsi, domestic growthfor soft drinks was less than 1%, largely because of its lossof the Burger King account to Coke. But Pepsi benefited froma 39% increase in operating profit in its restaurant group.Martin Romm at First Boston expects Coke's earnings per shareto jump about 13% in the first quarter, while Pepsi'sincrease 17%.   People get sick no matter what happens to the economy, andthe health care industry generally continued a string ofdouble-digit earnings growth. Profit increases at medicalsupply companies were fueled by &quot;continued strong demand formedical products and strong growth abroad,&quot; says Kenneth S.Abramowitz, analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. Heexpects more of the same in the current quarter.   Lower wage increases and gains in market share spurredhospital companies. Community Psychiatric's rise was aided bycomparison with a weak performance in the 1989 fourthquarter.   Earnings at pharmaceutical companies continued to soar onrobust sales of new products and strength in internationaloperations aided by favorable currency exchange rates. AtMerck currency gains contributed six percentage points to a19% increase in sales. Profit aided by a one-time charge inthe 1989 quarter surged at Pfizer. Excluding the charge,profit was up 16% on strong sales of Diflucan, an anti-viral,and Procardia XL, a heart drug. Bristol-Myers Squibb andUpjohn also reported profits after charges resulted in lossesin the year-ago period. Ronald Nordmann, analyst atPaineWebber, sees a strong first quarter and predicts drugindustry profits will rise 17% in 1991.   Personal-care companies reported strong earnings, buoyedby hefty international sales and some small price boosts.Strong results at Tambrands were due mainly to a cost-cuttingand restructuring program launched in 1989. At Neutrogena, aspecialty skin and hair care products company, resultssuffered as the company faced tougher competition andretailers reduced their inventories. Personal-care companiesare likely to continue to benefit from the weak dollarthrough the first quarter, but some consumers may trade downto cheaper products if the economy worsens.   Results were mixed for household products companies.Profits at most consumer packaged goods concerns remainedstrong during the quarter, but analysts warn that therecession could hurt sales of even basic consumer products.   Procter andamp; Gamble's net income soared because theyear-earlier quarter had been hurt by one-time charges.   Most tobacco makers reported strong gains despite theindustry's troubled image. At American Brands, a tobacco andlife insurance concern, earnings plunged because of a pretaxcharge of $215 million.

International Business Machines had been expected to havesome problems because it won't begin delivering until thesecond half the biggest of the mainframes it announced inSeptember. But mainframe demand didn't slip as much asexpected, and almost all its other product lines showedstrong growth. (Earnings growth was not, however, nearly asstrong as the 316% increase would indicate, because the 1989quarter included a $2.4 billion pretax restructuring charge.)   Digital Equipment reported a far smaller decline thanexpected, largely because of a jump in services and softwarerevenue. Compaq Computer continued to do extraordinarily welloverseas. Apple Computer's new, inexpensive Macintoshesexceeded expectations.   The outlook for this quarter remains hazy, becauseeconomic concerns are crimping customers' capital-spendingbudgets. In addition, growth is slowing in Europe and Japan,where many computer companies have generated most of theirprofits in recent years. Currency-exchange rates, however,should continue to help earnings through the first half.   Xerox did well, as sales of copiers and other officeequipment withstood the pressures of the weakening economyand the company used a one-time gain to clean up the books ofits financial-services arm. Pitney Bowes had modest growthbecause of cost-cutting; almost all of the huge increase inearnings came because of a $110 million charge in the 1989quarter to cover the company's departure from thecopier-remanufacturing business. But the weakening economycut earnings at other office-equipment makers, and theoutlook for the whole sector is unclear.   The semiconductor industry saw the latest of a string ofgrim quarters, as many electronics markets slowed purchasesof chips and falling prices bit into profit margins. AnalogDevices, in the midst of a restructuring, was hurt by fallingorders from the military and the sluggish economy's effect oncapital-equipment concerns that buy most of its chips.Advanced Micro and National were still affected by older,more price-sensitive product lines that have forced layoffs,plant closings and heavy development investment. Even Intel,which has been immune to the chip market's ailments becauseof its extremely profitable microprocessors, faced signs ofslower growth: its earnings, while up year-to-year, were downslightly from the immediately prior quarter. But some chipconcerns see hope: Advanced Micro expects a net profit in itsthird quarter; Avnet says chip prices are stabilizing, andAnalog says its chip orders picked up across the board inJanuary.   Software concerns faced widely varied fortunes, withMicrosoft continuing its ascendancy while others werebuffeted by internal factors such as high costs and producttransitions at a time when growth in software sales isslowing somewhat. The big story in PC software was thesuccess of Microsoft's Windows program, which boostedMicrosoft's revenue and cemented its role as thestandard-setter of the industry. Lotus, which wrote down $53million for its purchase of another software maker, was hurtby competition from Microsoft and Borland's spreadsheets,while Ashton-Tate's results reflected slow acceptance of itsdatabase programs. Oracle still suffered from revenue thathasn't kept pace with high costs. Prospects for 1991 aren'tclear, analysts said.   The performance of communications companies was a mixedbag as the weak economy continued to offer opportunity foronly lackluster growth for some firms.   Although American Telephone andamp; Telegraph's coretelecommunications and communications equipment businesshelped earnings, the company was hurt by higher costs at itsfinancial services sector, as it tried to keep up with thesuccess in its new credit card business.   Diversified technology companies' fourth-quarter profitswere hurt by defense budget cutbacks and the general weaknessin the economy. Wall Street analysts don't believe the Gulfwar will revitalize the companies' defense businesses becauseof the deep nature of the cutbacks.   United Technologies' profit dropped on poor results in itsmilitary electronics, building systems and automotivesegments. The profit decline came as a surprise to WallStreet analysts, who had expected the company to post a flatfourth quarter, at worst. One problem area was UTC'sradar-systems unit, which posted a loss and UTC said itcouldn't predict the unit's future results because ofcost-related problems.

Without thosehefty benefits, however, earnings would have been nearly flatfor many companies, reflecting a three-year slump in thehighly cyclical property-casualty business, analysts say.   Though few life insurance companies have yet reportedfourth-quarter results, earnings at Provident Life andamp; Accidentand Torchmark were down slightly. Torchmark's results weredown because of expenses associated with its failed bid forAmerican General, while Provident was hurt by losses oninvestments. Earnings of multiline insurers were also hurtbecause of smaller-than-usual investment income.   Savings andamp; loans posted losses or sharply lower earningsmainly because of commercial real estate deterioration andregulatory pressure to make big additions to loan-lossreserves. Golden West Financial showed profit growth,reflecting its strategy of sticking rigidly to less riskyhome-mortgage lending. During the first quarter of 1991,federal regulators will review the books of Golden West andH.F. Ahmanson, the last two major thrifts to be examined,said Montgomery Securities analyst Joe Jolson, but he doesn'texpect big surprises. Recession and reduced lending activity,negative factors in the fourth quarter, should bring flat orlower earnings in the current period, too. Analysts expectthe outlook to brighten by the second half as net interestmargins widen and regulators relent in their calls for newreserves.

GTE, which received approval for its $6 billion mergerwith Contel, posted a solid gain, but local phone companiesgenerally surprised analysts with anemic growth in customertelephone lines. In addition, fourth-quarter one-time chargesand rate cuts reduced net for some of the regional Bells.Bell Atlantic's net included $60 million in chargesreflecting declines in the value of its financial servicesbusiness. The year before, charges totaled $241.2 million.Pacific Tel set aside reserves of $71.5 million, including$60 million for expected real estate losses. Nynex revampedunregulated businesses, taking charges of $211 million. Theyear before it took a $325 million charge for equipmentwrite-downs, a strike by its unions, changes in its benefitplan and an early-retirement program for managers.   Utility results were mixed, with the weather contributingto wide regional variations in performance. Overall, analystssay fourth-quarter results were flat compared with 1989.Electric and gas companies in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic andSoutheast regions suffered from the unusually mild weatherthat has sharply reduced demand for home heating.                                                                                                          -- TELEPHONE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               4th Qtr.   4th Qtr.    %   15 Firms                        1990       1989     Chg                                                                                                          Alltel Corp                   55,735     47,706     +17   Amer Info Tech               286,800    331,700     -14   Bell Atlantic Corp           236,000     57,900    +308   BellSouth Corp               360,200    469,000     -23   Centel Corp                   14,271    229,515     -94   Cincinnati Bell               25,315     22,748     +11   Contel Corp                   59,000     84,000     -30   GTE Corp                     413,000    392,000     + 5   MCI Communicat               127,000    108,000     +18   NYNEX Corp                    60,700    -43,700     ...

It had only a minorimpact on the company, which posted an increase in profit,due largely to strengths in its &quot;long-cycle&quot; businesses andproductivity improvements. Sluggish auto and appliancemarkets continue to hurt the company, but GE said a &quot;strongmomentum&quot; in order trends continues in such long-cyclebusinesses as power generation and medical equipment.   Teledyne's net dropped sharply and the company attributedit to a previously made provision for losses related tocertain fixed-price contracts. Weakened steel and automotivemarkets also affected the company's results.   Textron's essentially flat earnings were the result ofweak commercial products sales tied to the auto market, whichoffset higher profit from financial services and aerospace,particularly its helicopter business.                                                                                                          -- CONGLOMERATES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               4th Qtr.   4th Qtr.    %   4 Firms                         1990       1989     Chg                                                                                                          General Electric           1,239,000  1,173,000     + 6   Greyhound Dial Corp           28,333     28,042     + 1   Teledyne Inc                     800     62,900     -99   Textron Inc                   78,100     77,100     + 1   TOTAL                      1,346,233  1,341,042       0</TEXT></DOC>
