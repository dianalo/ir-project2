The move came in response to an exhibit by a student at theSchool of the Art Institute of Chicago in which an American flag wasdisplayed on the floor in a fashion that resulted in spectatorsstanding on it.   ``What Is The Proper Way To Display The U.S. Flag,'' is the nameof the exhibit, which for the last four weeks has brought throngs ofangry demonstrators to march in front of the museum on MichiganAvenue in the heart of downtown Chicago.   Dole's bill would expand existing law against flag desecration toinclude the words ``knowingly displayed ... on the floor or ground.''   Dole said the Chicago display ``is not an appropriate use of thisnation's symbol of freedom _ our flag.''   ``Quite frankly, it shows direspect and contempt for our flag,and should be expressly prohibited by law,'' he said.   The controversy followed last year's furor over an Art Institutestudent's painting of the late Mayor Harold Washington wearingwomen's garments.   Emotions ran so high at that time that one alderman stormed intothe museum and ripped down the portrait of Washington, much belovedamong black Chicagoans and members of the city's independentpolitical movement.   The flag exhibit by 24-year-old art student Scott Tyler was to betaken down on Thursday after being on display for four weeks.   It already has drawn censure from the Illinois state House ofRepresentatives. But a judge quickly threw out a lawsuit aimed athaving the exhibit removed from public display.</TEXT></DOC>
