The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said trucesended five wars in 1988, cutting the number of active conflictsfrom 33 to 28.   ``There was a clear break in the constant increase in ... majorconflicts to which the world had grown accustomed during the1980s,'' said the institute's 1988 yearbook.   But, the report said an alarming 24 developing nations obtainedor were trying to obtain ballistic missiles. Many of them haverefused to sign the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty.   Cease-fires halted the Iran-Iraq war, the conflict betweenEthiopia and Somalia, the war between Chad and Libya and battleswithin Angola and Namibia, it said. Tensions eased in seven otherconflicts, although fighting grew fiercer in many other regional orcivil wars, said the 530-page report.   The institute, an independent group funded mainly by the Swedishparliament, tracks developments in weapons trading and armscontrol. Its yearbook has become a standard reference on theseissues.   Institute director, Walter Stuetzle, blamed the United Statesfor failing to respond to disarmament challenges offered by SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev, and urged the administration to hastennegotiations.   Stuetzle said the spread of ballistic missiles capable ofcarrying nuclear or chemical warheads was alarming.   ``The proliferation of nuclear weapons is a larger problem thanever before,'' said Stuetzle, a former West German undersecretaryof defense. ``This is nothing to be proud of 19 years after thenon-proliferation treaty.''   Seventeen nations have deployed ballistic missiles, and about500 may have been fired last year in the Iran-Iraq war, the reportsaid.   Stuetzle said Israel has the most advanced ballistic missileforce outside of the five major nuclear powers, including a 1,760pound artillery rocket that is the largest anywhere.   Argentina, Brazil, India, North Korea and Taiwan also make theirown missiles, the report said. Saudi Arabia last year boughtChinese-made CSS-2 systems, which are the most powerful missilesfound in the Third World, the report said.   But worldwide defense spending declined last year. Among the 16NATO members, the total defense budget dropped by 3 percent lastyear.   ``Finance ministers are winning over the defense ministers,''the report said.   And the United States is paying less for Europe's defense thanit claims, the report said, estimating that about 15 percent ofU.S. defense spending was directly related to North Atlantic TreatyOrganization, or about 0.9 percent of gross domestic product.   The report also said the international trade in conventionalweapons dropped slightly to $34 billion.   The Soviet Union and the United States were the largestsuppliers, responsible for 66 percent of the world market. Indiawas the largest buyer, followed by Iraq, North Korea, Saudi Arabiaand Afghanistan, the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
