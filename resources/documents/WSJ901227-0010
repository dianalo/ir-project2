The assurances are the main condition bondholders areseeking before approving the proposed swap, which would giveBank of New England breathing room by raising desperatelyneeded capital. Many analysts say that the bank won't be ableto survive for long if the swap isn't completed.</LP><TEXT>   Bondholder representatives, who tentatively agreed lastweek to swap $706 million in debentures for 92% ownership ofthe bank's common stock, said they are planning to meet withofficials at the office of the comptroller of the currencyearly next week. They plan to discuss whether the bank'spreliminary year-end earnings report, which has been given toregulators but not disclosed publicly, indicates an imminentseizure. Bondholder wariness was first reported yesterday inAmerican Banker.   &quot;No one is going to swap into mostly equity if theinstitution is about to be seized,&quot; said Gregory Kiernan,chairman of the subordinated bondholders committee. &quot;We'dlook like fools. It'd be tantamount to bondholder suicide.&quot;While bondholders have some contractual rights to a bank'sassets if it is seized, stockholders get wiped out.   The bondholders' minimum demand, according to a committeemember, is that the bank not be seized unless it becomesinsolvent -- generally defined as the moment when a bank'scapital has disappeared.   &quot;That's not a problem -- we almost never seize banksbefore they actually become insolvent,&quot; said Ellen Stockdale,a spokeswoman for the comptroller's office. &quot;But if thebondholders want a guarantee that we're not going to closethe bank in the near future, they're not going to get it. Wejust don't offer those kinds of assurances. If regulatorsfeel the bank is under water and getting in deeper, they'llwant to close it and not be constrained by some agreement.&quot;   The swap requires board and stockholder approval, and bothgroups are expected to clear it. The board, which metyesterday to discuss the matter, will &quot;continue its analysisand deliberations in early January,&quot; a spokesman said.   &quot;I think they'll iron out the details and the swap willhappen before the bank goes insolvent,&quot; says Gerard Cassidy,a bank analyst with Tucker Anthony and R.L. Day in Portland,Maine. &quot;Of course, even a successful swap will only buy themtime for a few quarters. And unless they get a grip onnonperforming assets and stop the losses, it will only mean alease on life until the summer or early fall.&quot;   If the board approves the swap, the bank must receiveregulatory clearance and then mail an offering tobondholders. Bondholders will have 21 days to respond. Onlyif 90% of the bonds are tendered will the deal proceed to itsfinal stage: shareholder approval of a vast, new issue ofstock to be swapped for the debt.   The problem is that all this takes time -- a commodity inshort supply these days at Bank of New England. The bank hada loss of $123 million in the third quarter, shrinking itscapital to a thin $255 million, only 1.1% of total assets of$23 billion.   With the weakened real estate market worsened by asluggish New England economy, Bank of New England wasstruggling under $2.84 million of nonperforming assets,mostly soured commercial real estate loans, as of Sept. 30.Carrying costs for that amount of bad assets is about $250million a year for the bank, which had a $203 million loss inthe first nine months of this year.   After the Bank of Boston Corp., which had a loss of $255million in the third quarter, announced last week that itwould report &quot;substantial losses&quot; for the fourth quarter,analysts began predicting fourth-quarter losses of between$100 million and $200 million for Bank of New England. Suchlosses would push the bank precariously close to insolvency.   The proposed swap, if successful, would boost Bank of NewEngland back to safer ground. By getting rid of $706 millionin debt, the bank will save about $60 million a year ininterest payments, and will push its total capital to nearly3% of total assets, a level regulators ordered the bank toreach by last spring.   To be swapped for the $706 million in existing debt wouldbe $606 million in special preferred stock which soon wouldbecome common stock, and $100 million in new debt that wouldrequire no interest payments and could be redeemed in fiveyears for cash or equity.   Of the numerous terms hashed out between the bank andbondholder representatives in almost six months ofnegotiations, only two relatively small provisions remain forthe board's approval, according to officials involved in thenegotiations. One involves the issuing of the $100 million innew debt. The bank had originally agreed to only $40 millionof such specialized debt, which gives bondholders somecontractual claims on the bank's assets if it is seized orpurchased. The other provision involves releases for thebank's board members from legal liability if the bank fails.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Bank of New England shares slipped 6.25 cents to 68.75 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
