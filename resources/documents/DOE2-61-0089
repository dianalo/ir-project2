The line shifts are of particular interestboth for their intrinsic value in terms of providing insight into thefundamental nature of the underlying physical processes affecting theemission of radiation as well as its diagnostic value in the study ofhigh-density plasmas. In addition, exact wavelengths of spectral linesof highly charged ions are required in the determination of line opacitiesand level positions for x-ray-laser transitions. The sensitivity of spectralline shift is investigated in the impact approximation for a varietyof assumptions using the distorted-wave with exchange approach. The formalismis applied to the Lyman-alpha line of hydrogen and ionized helium todetermine the influence of various assumptions on the line shift as wellas identifying the differences between a neutral and ionized radiator.The results are compared and contrasted with a number of other calculationsand experimental measurements.
