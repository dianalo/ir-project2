That development follows a federal appeals court'sdecision Friday reversing Mr. North's conviction in theIran-Contra affair on the grounds that trial proceedings mayhave been tainted by exposure to his testimony beforeCongress.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. North was convicted in May 1989 for altering anddestroying official documents, accepting an illegal gratuity,and aiding and abetting in the obstruction of Congress. Theformer national security aide received a suspended jailsentence and a $150,000 fine that he hasn't yet been requiredto pay. He was also sentenced to 1,200 hours of communityservice.   The appeals court dismissed the lower court's ruling onthe document-shredding conviction on technical groundsregarding the way Judge Gesell instructed the jury.   The other two counts weren't dismissed outright. But theappellate decision substantially improves Mr. North's chancesof being cleared of all criminal charges. It also may benefitformer National Security Adviser John Poindexter, whoreceived a six-month jail sentence in June for his role inthe Iran-Contra affair. Mr. Poindexter, who was convicted onfive counts, including conspiracy and obstruction ofCongress, is expected to appeal his case.   Friday's ruling came in response to a challenge by Mr.North and the American Civil Liberties Union. Lawyers for Mr.North and the ACLU questioned the prosecution's ability tohonor the &quot;use immunity&quot; guarantee granted to Mr. North bythe congressional Iran-Contra committee. Under use immunity,a witness such as Mr. North can be forced to testify providedthat testimony isn't used against him in a criminalproceeding.   In a 2-to-1 ruling, the appeals court panel ruled that thelower court should have held a full hearing to demonstratethat independent counsel Lawrence Walsh made no use of Mr.North's testimony before the Iran-Contra committee. In orderto maintain Mr. North's conviction, Mr. Walsh now must showin a hearing before Judge Gesell that this testimony didn'taffect the trial.   &quot;Everyone familiar with these proceedings has recognizedthe difficulty presented by the grants of immunity byCongress,&quot; Mr. Walsh said in a statement Friday. &quot;We havediligently tried to work around these difficulties.&quot;   In its decision, the court expressed concern that Reaganadministration officials who watched or were briefed on Mr.North's televised testimony to the Iran-Contra committeeswere influenced by it when they subsequently testified at Mr.North's trial.   For example, the court said that former National SecurityAdviser Robert McFarlane, who testified to the Iran-Contracommittee before Mr. North's appearance, testified a secondtime at his own request after Mr. North. In this secondappearance, the court said, Mr. McFarlane responded directlyto Mr. North's testimony, and &quot;apparently managed to recallitems he had not remembered&quot; the first time around. Mr.McFarlane was a key government witness at Mr. North's trial.   Given the appeals court's strict requirements concerninguse immunity, Mr. Walsh is unlikely to prevail in a hearingbefore Judge Gesell. A more likely course is for Mr. Walsh toeither petition all the judges of the appeals court circuitfor a rehearing, or to petition the Supreme Court. Mr. Walshdidn't say Friday what course of action he would take.</TEXT></DOC>
