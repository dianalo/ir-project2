In the construction of prestressedconcrete emergency flood concrete enclosure walls, pre-cooling methodusing LNG was employed to prevent cracking. This paper reports the summaryof the construction work, plan for the prevention of cracking, and theresult of the operation. From the analysis of temperature stress to thecompletion of the pre-cooling construction work, cracking was successfullyprevented as planned, achieving the intended purpose. It is assumed thatthe current construction of maximum 700 m{sup 3}/day, totaling 1,150m{sup 3} has presented a useful construction data as an application exampleof the new crack preventing construction method.
