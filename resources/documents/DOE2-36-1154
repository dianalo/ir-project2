<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-36-1154 </DOCNO><TEXT>Azodicarbonamide (ADA), a solid blowing agent used in the manufactureof plastics, has been selected for inhalation toxicity testing by theNational Toxicology Program. To test for decomposition of ADA duringaerosolization, an HPLC method was developed to quantitate the relativeamounts of one possible degradation product, biurea, in bulk samplesand filter samples collected after aerosolization. The method uses aC{sub 18} column with 10-{mu}m particles, UV monitoring at 190 nm forbiurea and 425 nm for ADA, and a mobile phase of 100% water. Quantitationis with {sup 14}C-labeled biurea and ADA as external standards. The assaywas validated by spiking bulk ADA with projected levels of 1, 2, and3% biurea. Levels of biurea bound in both bulk and filter-collected aerosolsamples ADA were both 0.50%, with relative standard deviations of 13and 26%, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
