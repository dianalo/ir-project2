Gorbachev lastmet with a U.S. president, the Soviet leader's world has turnedtopsy-turvy, with a legislature challenging him at home anddemonstrators chasing Communist regimes from power in EasternEurope.   On the U.S. side, the change is less striking: Simply the man atthe top.   As George Bush prepares for his first meeting as president withGorbachev, the world overseas appears to be changing at a fasterpace than at any time since World War II, when President FranklinD. Roosevelt began the practice of sitting down for a summit withthe Soviet leader, at that time Josef Stalin.   Since the most recent superpower summit on Dec. 7, 1988, whenGorbachev met with President Reagan and then-Vice President Bush inNew York, Poland has formed the first non-Communist government inthe Soviet bloc, Hungary has scrapped its Communist Party, EastGermany has opened the Berlin Wall, Bulgaria has dumped itslongtime Communist boss, and the Czechoslovakian Communist Partyhas surrendered its monopoly on power.   Only Romania, long a maverick in the Warsaw Pact, has remainedcold to the thaw started by Gorbachev after he rose to power inMarch 1985.   For years the Soviets complained about what they perceived asthe tumult of the U.S. electoral process, with presidentialballoting every four years and congressional races every twoclouding the rare air of geopolitics.   Now the United States seems tranquil compared to thefree-for-all in the Communist world.   Bush, under pressure to respond to changes in the Soviet bloc,scheduled the meeting with Gorbachev off the Mediterranean isle ofMalta this weekend. He has also begun planning for a militarycutback.   He would be hard put to keep pace with the revolution in EasternEurope.   In the Soviet Union, the Communist Party was embarrassed inelections last March, the most democratic legislature in 72 yearsof Soviet history is learning to stand up to the government and theparty, and ethnic unrest has shaken the country from the Baltic Seato Central Asia.   On the international front, Bush administration officials, liketheir predecessors, are complaining that Soviet surrogatesNicaragua and Cuba are exporting revolution to El Salvador.   Closer to Moscow, Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan lastFebruary, but the Kremlin-backed government there remains in power.The president of the U.S.-backed Afghan Interim Government inexile, Sibghatullah Mojaddedi, on Monday said he wants Bush topressure Gorbachev to end support for the ``puppet government'' andreach a political accord with the resistance.   In arms control, many hurdles have been cleared, but thesuperpowers have not finalized deals to cut nuclear, conventionaland chemical weapons.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told Secretary ofState James A. Baker III last September in Wyoming that the Kremlinwas removing two major obstacles to a proposed Strategic ArmsReduction Treaty (START) to reduce long-range superpower nuclearweapons by up to 50 percent.   Shevardnadze said the Soviets were withdrawing the preconditionthat America abandon its Star Wars strategic defense initiative. Healso said the Soviets were seeking a separate agreement to limitsubmarine-launched cruise missiles, rather than include them inSTART.   But the Soviets have been pressing for talks to curb the mightof the U.S. Navy, and want to ban the submarine cruise missileswithin that framework.   Although changes have been more slow and orderly in the UnitedStates, they have occurred. Bush has replaced Reagan as presidentand after months of skepticism appears to have embraced Gorbachev'sreforms.   Bush's apparent uncertainty prompted Democrats, led by SenateMajority Leader George Mitchell of Maine, to label the Republicanpresident as ``timid'' in responding to Gorbachev.   Bush's backers claim he has been playing a cool hand,alternating his public hesitation with careful preparation andbrilliant masterstrokes.   He was heavily criticized for not replying in kind toGorbachev's surprise announcement, before his last summit withReagan, that he was unilaterally withdrawing 50,000 troops fromEastern Europe and cutting the Red Army by 500,000.   Then Bush proposed last May that the two alliances agree withina year to make sharp cuts that would eliminate the Warsaw Pactnumerical advantage.   Now the alliances appear near an agreement under which theUnited States would reduce its forces in Central Europe by 30,000,and the Soviets by ten times that many.   Before the Oct. 31 announcement that he would meet withGorbachev in Malta, Bush was criticized for not seeking a summit.Bush says, and the Soviets have not disagreed, that he firstrequested the meeting after he traveled to Poland and Hungary lastJuly and met with reform leaders who urged him to consultface-to-face with the Soviet leader.</TEXT></DOC>
