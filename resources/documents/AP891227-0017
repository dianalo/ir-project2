Bush aides say they hope he'll have better luck than last year,when dry conditions made the tiny game birds scarce.   The president will spend several days isolated _ but never outof touch, aides insist _ at the 10,000-acre Lazy F Ranch nearBeeville in South Texas, owned by his friend, Houston millionaireWill Farish.   ``It's been a tradition for the past 20 years,'' said aideStephen Hart, who worked for Bush as vice president and has beenalong on several of the previous quail-hunting trips.   ``They drive around the ranch in big specially designed trucks,then hunt with dogs. If they can catch turkey, too, then that's abig treat,'' Hart said.   In the past, Bush has hunted quail with a 20-gauge shotgun,dressed in snake-resistant chaps, heavy leather boots and an orangehunting cap.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, expected to be along onthe trip, is known to prefer turkey hunting, which requires greaterpatience.   But Bush, who likes to jump from event to event, has defendedthe sport of quail hunting as more to his liking _ and has assertedthat the birds are not to be regarded as cute animals but as wily,determined quarry.   ``These aren't animals _ these are wild quail, '' Bush declaredduring last year's trip in a remark that angered animal rightsgroups. ``You've got to eat. Our forefathers ate by harvestinggame.''   The Texas office of The Fund for Animals has written to Bushasking him to cancel the hunt, and plans to have animal activiststravel to Beeville to protest his activities if he carries out hishunting plans.   It seems likely that Bush and Baker will discuss another wily,determined quarry while on the ranch _ deposed Panamanian dictatorManuel Antonio Noriega.   Noriega's decision to go Sunday to the Vatican embassy in PanamaCity, where he is currently in hiding, took a lot pressure off theBush administration as it seeks to help restore post-invasion orderin Panama.   However, aides said Bush never wavered from his determination tomake the hunting trip, and that little _ short of a major crisis _would force him to cancel the trip.   The town of Beeville, population about 15,000, is throwing abarbecue for the president tonight upon his arrival _ but probablywon't see him again. Once he enters the vast ranch, he is notexpected to be seen publicly in the area. He will fly by helicopterdirectly to Houston on Friday.   Meanwhile, the Chamber of Commerce of neighboring Goliad, Texas,is fussing to the White House that the part of the ranch where Bushhunts is actually in Goliad, not Beeville _ and that it should beable to share in the publicity.   But the sheriff of Goliad County, J.K. McMahan, says it's finewith him if the president keeps a low profile. Referring to recentstories that Colombian drug lords may have put a $30 million priceon the president's head, McMahan said recently: ``I don't want himkilled, period, but I damn sure don't want him killed in mycounty.''   Bush also plans to bracket his quail-hunting with two fishingexpeditions _ another endeavor in which the president has not hadmuch recent luck.   Bush planned to fish for redfish in the Gulf of Mexico, offCorpus Christi, today on his way to Beeville.   And on New Year's Day, after spending several days in Houston,including a side trip on Sunday to two military hospitals in SanAntonio to visit soldiers wounded in Panama, Bush will take aboutfive hours out on his return to Washington to fish for bass on aprivate lake near Montgomery, Ala.</TEXT><TEXT>   The White House says it's glad that Time Magazine selectedSoviet leader Mikhail S.
