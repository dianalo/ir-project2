Jesse Jackson told striking Boeing Co.workers not to give up and a union van in Wichita, Kan., was hit bygunfire over the weekend as the walkout entered its 20th day Mondaywith no new talks scheduled.   The strike by nearly 60,000 Machinists began Oct. 4. Anegotiating session called by federal mediator Douglas Hammondended Wednesday after just four hours.   Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz was to speak Monday to a group ofSeattle media and business leaders on ``The Boeing Strike: TheInside Story.''   Under ground rules for the appearance before the Seattle Chamberof Commerce Community Development Roundtable, the meeting was to beclosed and none of the comments published, officials said.   To counter the session, the Washington State Labor Council andMachinists union set their own briefing on the strike. Tom Baker,president of Machinists District Lodge 751, was to talk to laborleaders and reporters at the same time as Shrontz's speech.   In Wichita, site of a large Boeing plant, two men and a womanwere arrested Saturday after a van outside the union's strikeheadquarters was sprayed by shotgun pellets. No one was injured andthe three were released on bond pending court action.   Witnesses said several blasts were fired from a passing car atabout 2 a.m. Saturday, striking the van, the building, parkedvehicles and a neon sign, said Harold Stocking, shift strikecaptain at the Machinists' Aero Lodge 834. The incident occurred asvans were preparing to take pickets to their posts.   Meanwhile, Jackson told 5,000 Machinists who marched onSaturday: ``When these strikes get long, don't give up. You muststand together for fairness and dignity.''   The marchers carried plastic bag-covered picket signs, balloonsand umbrellas in the rainy weather.   ``Boeing is number one because its workers are number one,''Jackson said at a rally following the march.   Baker told the crowd it's time for Boeing to provide its workerswith better health care benefits and with child care provisions.   ``No new planes can be built without you,'' said Justin Ostrow,Machinists International vice president. ``And no new planes willbe built without you.''   Machinists voted overwhelmingly to strike rather than take athree-year contract with wage increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and3 percent. The company also offered bonuses of 8 percent of grosspay in the first year and 3 percent the second; cost-of-livingboosts virtually matching inflation; a 20 percent cut in mandatoryovertime; and higher benefits.   Machinists represent about 57,800 Boeing workers nationwide,including 43,300 in the Puget Sound area, 12,000 in Wichita, Kan.,1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred others at scatteredsites in California, Hawaii, Montana, Utah and other states. Boeinghas a total 164,000 workers worldwide and 106,000 in Washingtonstate.</TEXT></DOC>
