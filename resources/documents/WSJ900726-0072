Mr. Brady, in testimony before the Senate BankingCommittee, said the Treasury is worried that banks'profitability is being hurt by restrictions that prevent themfrom fully entering the securities and insurance business,and from opening branches throughout the U.S. Many of thebanks' best customers, &quot;including blue-chip corporations, nowborrow directly from investors&quot; through short-term debtsecurities, Mr. Brady said.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The result has been concentration in the riskiest linesof permitted business, such as commercial real estatelending, highly leveraged transactions, and loans to lesserdeveloped countries,&quot; the Treasury secretary said. He addedthat the limitations are creating &quot;greater risk to the systemand the taxpayer, not less.&quot;   Mr. Brady's comments were the opening salvo in acontroversial attempt to expand bank powers. The Treasury ispreparing proposals to restructure the banking industry andthe deposit-insurance system and expects to announce them byearly next year. But amid the savings-and-loan bailout,expected to cost the government up to $500 billion withinterest, many members of Congress are wary of giving banksmore powers.   But Mr. Brady, echoing the view of many banking experts,said lack of capital was the culprit in the Sandamp;L mess, not thederegulation of the industry in the early 1980s. Capitalrepresents the investment of a bank's or thrift's owners thatis drained off before federal deposit insurance is called in.Though he didn't specifically call for higher capitalrequirements, Mr. Brady suggested that broader powers shouldbe given only to well-capitalized institutions.   &quot;I can't imagine recommending any changes in the bankinglaw that wouldn't put a very high premium on capital,&quot; hesaid.   Mr. Brady was less specific about the Treasury's proposalsto change deposit insurance, but appeared to be leaningtoward recommending that the $100,000 insurance limit ondeposits remain in place. &quot;We've got to take a very hard lookat that problem,&quot; he said. &quot;But frankly, I can't see at thisparticular point in time a rush to lower that amount ofinsurance when we have a question of confidence not only inour banks, but obviously in our thrifts.&quot;   Asked by Sen. Alan Dixon, (D., Ill.) about limitingdeposit insurance to one account per person, a very popularidea on Capitol Hill these days, Mr. Brady said, &quot;Well, ifyou were going to start anyplace, that would be a place tostart.&quot;   Commenting on recent statements by William Seidman, headof the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., that the FDIC'sbank-insurance fund is &quot;under stress,&quot; Mr. Brady emphasized&quot;the qualification&quot; Mr. Seidman made: that it would take asevere recession before taxpayer dollars would be required toback up the bank fund. &quot;We can't make all our economicjudgments&quot; as if a big recession is in the offing, theTreasury secretary said.   &quot;The point is to stay out of a severe recession, which Ithink we will do,&quot; he added. Mr. Brady also rejectedsuggestions by some private analysts that the bankingindustry is currently harboring problems that could grow tothe size of the Sandamp;L crisis in a few years. &quot;To compare thebanking system to the Sandamp;Ls in 1988 is a comparison I don'tthink should be made,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
