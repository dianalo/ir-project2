Walter Thompson Co., executives close to the airline said.   Northwest, a unit of NWA Inc., is expected to consolidateboth its domestic advertising and international advertisingat Thompson, the executives said. Currently, Saatchi handlesthe domestic account, which billed between $40 million and$50 million last year, though it is believed to be billingonly about half of that this year. McCann, a unit ofInterpublic Group of Cos., handles the airline's advertisingin Japan, a relatively small account with billings of under$10 million. Northwest has indicated that it might spend asmuch as $80 million to $90 million next year.</LP><TEXT>   The switch would be among the biggest wins in years forThompson. And Thompson isn't the only WPP Group unit expectedto emerge a winner in the account shuffle. The executivessaid Northwest has promised sister agency Ogilvy andamp; Matherthat it will get Northwest's shuttle account, assuming theairline's negotiations to buy the Trump Shuttle aresuccessful. Foote, Cone andamp; Belding Communications also emergesa winner, with a $15 million assignment including ads gearedto frequent flyers and corporate flyers.   A Northwest spokesman declined to comment on the shuffle,other than to say, &quot;We have been looking at our advertisingsituation. There will be some announcements at an appropriatetime when we have finalized some things.&quot; But McCannconfirmed that it had lost its small portion of the account,though it didn't elaborate. Executives at the other agenciesinvolved either declined comment or couldn't be reached.   Northwest never formally held an advertising review, butits decision to make an agency switch still isn't surprising.The airline in May asked six agencies, including Saatchi,Thompson, Ogilvy and Foote Cone, to present ideas aboutshuttle advertising. Despite the airline's insistence thatonly the potential shuttle account was at stake, adexecutives maintained the entire account was up for grabs.Also part of the review were D'Arcy Masius Benton andamp; Bowlesand Young andamp; Rubicam.   Thompson has been the odds-on favorite from the startinggate. Earlier this year, Northwest named a new marketing teamheaded up by Christopher Clouser, a senior vice president;Mr. Clouser worked with Thompson in his two previous jobs, asa top marketing executive at Bell Atlantic and, before that,at Sprint. Just last week, Northwest announced that it hadnamed Victoria Hayden as its vice president of advertising.Ms. Hayden's previous job: a vice president at Thompson,where she worked on the Bell Atlantic account.   The win would provide a much-needed morale boost forThompson; it would be the biggest new account to tapThompson's New York office in more than three years. The lastmajor win came in 1988, when the agency picked up thethen-$60 million Bell Atlantic account headed up by Mr.Clouser.   Northwest's account could help ease the sting of othertroubles at the agency. Thompson has lost a string of mid- tosenior-level managers recently. Its Los Angeles office hasbeen racked by client defections. Since last year, the LosAngeles office has lost the $35 million Twentieth Century FoxFilm account; resigned from the $60 million Bally's account;and, last month, lost the $20 million Von's supermarketbusiness.   Ogilvy could also use Northwest's vote of confidence. Theagency's New York office has been struggling for severalyears with account losses and executive defections. Itcurrently is battling against two other agencies to keepAmerican Express's $60 million-plus green card account, achallenge made more difficult by the departure of a number ofthe Ogilvy executives closest to the account. The Northwestnews couldn't come at a better time for Ogilvy, Thompson andtheir parent WPP, which has been wrestling with debt problemsof its own.   Though Saatchi has for the past several months expected tolose the Northwest business, the split is still painful. Theagency's work for Northwest cost it the $100 million RJRNabisco account several years ago. After Saatchi developedNorthwest ads applauding a non-smoking policy, RJR promptlyfired the agency, even though Saatchi handled RJR's Nabiscobrands and didn't do any work on its cigarette brands.   The switch appears to herald a global advertising approachby Northwest. Advertising executives say the airline has beeninterested in consolidating its domestic and internationaladvertising to forge a more unified approach to marketingaround the world. While Saatchi created award-winningadvertising for Northwest, it wouldn't be eligible to handlethe account worldwide because everywhere but in the U.S., italready handles the big British Airways account, which wouldpose a major conflict.   ---   Nintendo Fires Foote Cone                                                                                                          Nintendo of America pulled the $20 million ad account forits Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy video gamesystems from Foote, Cone andamp; Belding's San Francisco office andput it in review.   The company, a Redmond, Wash., unit of Nintendo Co. ofJapan, said it expects to pick another agency next month andhas already decided on a short list of contenders butdeclined to identify them.   In the meantime, Nintendo has reassigned the business withLeo Burnett, Chicago, which won the $25 million account forNintendo's coming Super Entertainment System in April. Thatmove has stirred speculation the video-game marketer maysimply consolidate all of its ad business with Burnett nextmonth. Burnett was also a finalist when Nintendo awardedFoote Cone the business in June 1990.   Nintendo said in a statement that the decision to fireFoote Cone stemmed from &quot;philosophical differences&quot; anddeclined to comment further. Foote Cone officials declined tocomment. But industry executives said the agency and Nintendohad different preferences for new-product introductions:Foote Cone wanted to have a single creative team come up witha concept, while Nintendo preferred to pick from a number ofcreative ideas, each developed by a different team.    ---   Ad Notes. . . .                                                                                                          ATandamp;T Talks: American Telephone andamp; Telegraph confirmed thatits Universal Card unit is talking to a number of ad agenciesabout a new direct-mail assignment, as reported yesterday inAdweek magazine. But the ATandamp;T spokesman said Universal Cardis &quot;not looking to move our advertising or end anyrelationships at this time.&quot; The card's current agencies areLord, Dentsu andamp; Partners, a joint venture of Young andamp; Rubicamand Dentsu, and Chapman Direct, a Yandamp;R unit that handlesdirect marketing. Yandamp;R's work on behalf of its WundermanWorldwide unit for rival charge card American Express hasraised questions of a potential conflict.                                                                                                          SMITH BARNEY TALKS: Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. saidit has talked to several ad agencies and may talk to more inthe coming months &quot;for new perspectives.&quot; The talks weredisclosed yesterday in Advertising Age magazine. But thebrokerage firm, a unit of Primerica Corp., said it continuesto &quot;do business as usual&quot; with its longtime agency, WPPGroup's Ogilvy andamp; Mather.

Billings are expected to total $45 million to$100 million over three years. . . . Pillsbury, a unit ofGrand Metropolitan, named UniWorld Group, New York, to handleblack-consumer advertising for its baked goods division.Billings are estimated at slightly over $1 million.                                                                                                          COMPLAINT DISMISSED: The federal Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms dismissed a complaint from Adolph CoorsCo. about an ad for Bud Dry beer, made by rivalAnheuser-Busch Cos. In a letter to Coors, first disclosed inthe trade publication Food andamp; Drink Daily, a bureau officialcalled the ad claims in question &quot;acceptable puffery.&quot; Thead, created by DDB Needham, shows a generic light-beer bottlespouting water the way a garden sprinkler does, while avoice-over says Bud Dry is &quot;dry-brewed, not watered down.&quot;                                                                                                          COMMERCIAL FINGERPRINT: Prime Network, which owns sixregional sports cable-TV networks and is affiliated with nineothers, has contracted with Broadcast Data Systems to trackthe commercials that run on its networks.
