AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Security forces arrested threemembers of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's general staff and about 35other soldiers after a failed coup, according to a ``warcommunique'' read over national radio Wednesday.   Panamanian officials also said rebelling troops held Noriega forseveral hours during the attempted coup Tuesday but that the coup'sleader was killed during the fighting.   The communique did not give any reason for the arrests of Col.Guillermo Wong, the head of state security, and two other membersof the 20-member High Command, the Panamanian equivalent of ageneral staff.   If members of the High Command were implicated in the coup,however, it would mean the plotting against Noriega extended muchhigher than the lower-level officers involved in the rebellion.   In those clashes, rebel soldiers captured the headquarters inPanama City, but troops loyal to Noriega recaptured the compoundseveral hours later.   Wednesday's government communique said 10 rebels were killed inthe fighting and 26 people were wounded. There were 18 wounded inforces loyal to Defense Forces chief Noriega, three from the rebelforces and five civilians, it said.   The communique also said five coup leaders had taken refuge atFort Clayton, a U.S. base a few miles from Panama City. U.S.officials have refused comment on that report.   The other two arrested members of the High Command were Col.Julio Ow Young and Col. Armando Palacios Gondola. Both had recentlyserved as Defense Forces representatives when theNoriega-controlled government held talks with the civil oppositionin August.   In addition, Palacios was a member of the combined staff of U.S.and Panamanian officers that deals with Panama Canal security anddefense issues.   Defense Forces spokesmen were not available for comment on thearrests, according to people who answered phones at headquarters.   The communique read by an announcer did nothing more than listthe names and ranks of those arrested, wounded or killed.   Earlier, Maj. Edgardo Lopez, a Defense Forces spokesman, said atleast 60 soldiers and four of five officers had been arrestedshortly after the fighting.   The arrest of Ow Young was puzzling because the officers whomounted Tuesday's coup effort had named him as an officer to beforcibly retired.   One report said the lower-level officers who rebelled weredisgruntled over not being promoted. In their only communique, therebels said they were discarding the entire high command. Thatcommunique was signed by a major and tw captains.   The other 20 officers arrested ranged in rank from secondlieutenant to captain. About 15 sergeants, corporals and enlistedmen were also under arrest, the communique said.   The communique also said 10 rebels, including nine officers,died in the shooting Tuesday. It said the dead included Maj. MoisesGiroldi Vega, commander of the Urraca company, which was blamed forthe revolt. The unit is in charge of security at defenseheadquarters.   Around Panama City, government troops patrolled lightly traveledstreets Wednesday while U.S. helicopters watched from overhead.   ``The gringo piranhas want to do away with me,'' the generalsaid during a brief tour of the street outside Panamanian DefenseForces headquarters. Noriega has accused the United States ofsupporting the attempted coup.   The United States has been trying to oust Noriega for almost twoyears, but the Bush administration denied any involved in Tuesday'scoup attempt.   Later in the day, several thousand people, many of them publicemployees, demonstrated in front of the building to show theirsupport for Noriega. The general leaned out a second-story windowand waved through iron bars.   A Noriega aide said Wednesday that rebel officers trying todepose Noriega captured him and held him for several hours Tuesdaybut released him after loyal forces warned the rebels would ``facethe consequences'' if he was harmed.   Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon, director for the Defense ForcesSecurity and Defense Committee, told reporters that while beingheld Tuesday, Noriega ``had tried to calm his captors ... trying toavoid bloodshed.''   ``The surrender came when the loyal officers took command of thecombat units and gave the rebels a last chance to release thecommander and members of his staff or face the consequences,''Castrejon said. ``The general was a hostage for four hours.''   Later, however, Castrejon said Noriega was held five hours. Itwas not clear if Noriega was held when the final assault was madeby loyal troops.   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity inWashington, said earlier Wednesday they were mystified by thedecision to let Noriega go.   The United States has been imposed economic sanctions and triedother measures to oust Noriega after he was indicted on U.S. drugtrafficking and money laundering charges in Florida in February1988. Noriega denies the charges.   In Panama City, neighbors said they saw Noriega enter DefenseForces headquarters with members of his staff Tuesday morning, andthat the shooting began about 10 minutes later. They spoke oncondition of anonymity.   During the fighting, Castrejon made a TV announcement sayingNoriega was in an undisclosed location and was in radio contactwith his troops.   Later, Lopez, the Defense Forces spokesman, said Noriega hadpersonally taken the rebels' surrender, meaning he was on the spotwhen the fighting ended.   Many Panamanians chose to stay home Wednesday and U.S. baseswere shut under condition Delta, which restricts movement ofpersonnel. About 12,000 American soldiers are stationed in Panama.   The uprising ``aggravated the Panamanian crisis in everydimension and makes it more dangerous,'' opposition leader RicardoArias Calderon told a news conference. He said the military regime``is divided against itself and rejected by the great majority ofthe people.''   Civilian foes of Noriega denied involvement.   U.S. sanctions have damaged the economy, but Noriega remains. Heannulled the opposition's election victory May 7 and has put downtwo coup attempts.   After the battle Tuesday, Noriega replaced the 350-member Urracacompany, with the Machos de Monte, or Wild Boars, a unit thatjoined the counterattack.   At the United Nations in New York, President Francisco Rodrigueztold a news conference the coup was attempted by a small group ofsoldiers ``fostered and supported by the government of the UnitedStates ... that found no resonance of any kind within the ranks ofthe Defense Forces or citizens.''</TEXT></DOC>
