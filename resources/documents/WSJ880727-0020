The bargaining sessions began Saturday, when a federal mediator met with representatives of the 9,000-member Writers Guild of America and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. Yesterday's talks continued well past a midnight deadline set by a National Labor Relations Board representative.    A spokeswoman for the guild said talks wouldn't resume until today at the earliest. Federal mediators have imposed a news blackout while talks continue to end the strike, now in its fifth month. The bargaining sessions are the first in more than a month.    A spokesman for the producers said the federal mediator declared the recess without setting a date for future meetings.    Yesterday's talks temporarily delayed negotiations between producers and the Teamsters union local that represents studio transportation drivers, a union spokeswoman said. Their contract expires at the end of the month. A separate union, the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees, last week to agreed to extend the deadline on its contract to Jan. 31 from July 31. </TEXT></DOC>
