Bond Corp., which bought a 19.9% stake in Bell Group Friday from Robert Holmes a Court, said that it plans to seek representation on the company's board but doesn't plan a full takeover offer. The State Government Insurance Commission of Western Australia, which also purchased a 19.9% stake from Mr. Holmes a Court, said it will be a passive investor.    Some Bell Group holders complained that they can't sell their shares for the price received by Mr. Holmes a Court, who was paid 2.70 Australian dollars ($2.05) a share by Bond and 2.50 dollars a share by the insurance commission. A full takeover offer at these prices isn't required because the stakes were kept under 20% each.    Bell Group's shares rose 10 cents yesterday, to 1.80 dollars.    Ray Schoer, executive director of the National Companies and Securities Commission, said yesterday that inquiries so far haven't found any breach of rules in the transaction. Mr. Holmes a Court and the existing Bell Group board remain in control of the company, he said. Most analysts expect Mr. Holmes a Court to step down as Bell Group's chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;In order to allow the position to be clarified,&quot; regulators have asked that no appointments be made to the board for two weeks, Mr. Schoer said.    Separately, the Australian government said the transactions appear to put Bond in contravention of government cross-media ownership rules, meaning it would have to sell some media assets. Bond is allowed several months to decide which asets to sell, the government said. </TEXT></DOC>
