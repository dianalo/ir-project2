 VM, MVS.CICS, JCL, TSO.andP;  Pity the corporatecitizen who tries to penetrate the alpha-numeric fog shrouding theinformation stored in the company's mainframe.andP;  Until recently, anyone with apressing need for mainframe data requested it indirectly, through the MISdepartment, with fingers crossed for timely delivery of a meaningfulresponse.andM;Several large hardware and software vendors are rushing to develop newtechnology that will bridge the chasm between mainframes and micros.andP;  IBM isbusy touting its new Systems Application Architecture (SAA), which isdesigned to help link all IBM hardware platforms, from mainframes to PCs.andO;And other major software vendors, including Lotus Development Corp., havestepped in with applications that help corporate users tap into enormousmainframe databases and use the power of the corporate mainframe to performPC-like tasks.andM;Meanwhile, the world of mainframe operations isn't necessarily as inscrutableas it seems.andP;  If your dealings with the corporate mainframe have been cloakedin mystery, read on to shed some light on the subject and to preview thequantum leap that micro-to-mainframe connectivity will take during thisdecade.andM;IBM: Market MonsterandM;Since the beginning of the PC revolution and for many years before, thestandard abbreviation for the word mainframe has been simple: IBM.andP;  In 1988the company controlled a whopping 73% of the mainframe market.andM;Key to the success of IBM mainframes is their common architecture--thepromise that operating systems and software that work on one mainframe in theproduct line will work just as well on another.andP;  However, IBM mainframes arenot compatible with IBM mid-range computers, such as the AS/400.andM;IBM mainframes cover a broad range of price and functionality.andP;  The smallestmodel in the Enterprise Systems/9370, or ES/9370, series is about the size ofa file cabinet and can comfortably handle the needs of about a dozen usersrunning one or two applications.andP;  Such a configuration starts at less than$50,000.andM;Models in the ES/3090 series, on the other hand, are IBM's biggestmainframes, with prices reaching $10 million or more.andP;  An ES/3090 Model 600J, currently the most powerful machine in the line, can support numerouscomplex applications and tens of thousands of users in a multinationalcorporation.andM;Machines in the 4381 series fall between these two extremes.andP;  Computers inthese three series constitute the bulk of IBM's current mainframe line.andP;  Allconform to the 370 processor architecture, which is the current standard forIBM mainframes.andP;  Thus, you could call any one of these computers a 370.andM;The mainframe system at Chemical Bank, the nation's sixth-largest bankholding company, stores over 1 terabyte of data on disk.andP;  A terabyte equals 1million megabytes--the equivalent of 50,000 20-megabyte PC hard disks.andO;Several customized mainframe banking applications on several mainframes sharethis data.andP;  &quot;Mainframes are best geared for that kind of activity because oftheir sheer power,&quot; notes Fred Mathesie, manager of technical planning in thebank's processing-services group.andP;  &quot;Where there's a need for a very largedatabase, for instantaneous response, for a lot of message switching betweendifferent databases, maiframes work well.&quot;andM;But the mainframe role, while expanding, has been redefined by the PCrevolution of the 1980s.andP;  Desktop computers dedicated to a single user haveusurped many of the day-to-day computing tasks once reserved for mainframesor minicomputers.andP;  &quot;We see more and more of that application processingmoving toward the personal computer,&quot; says John Senor, manager of corporatemarketing for information Builders (New York), a leading software vendor inthe micro-to-mainframe field.andP;  &quot;The PC has helped accelerate the movement oftechnology toward the end user.&quot;andM;These rapid advances in PC capacity have created the popular misconceptionthat the desktop PC is just like a little mainframe.andP;  In fact, the designprinciples behind the two machines are quite different.andP;  The centralprocessor of a PC handles most tasks related to that PC, includinginput/output, communications, and control of peripherals.andP;  Mainframe designis hierarchical, and the central processor acts as the keystone in a complexstructure.andP;  The mainframe uses various hardware and software mechanisms toshunt tasks away from the central processor and to optimize those tasks thatthe central processor performs.andM;Because of this radical difference in structure and because of the obviousdifferences in the scope of the hardware, PC applications and mainframeapplications have developed along different tracks, especially in importantareas such as user interface.andP;  Though big high-tech companies have begun topush connectivity solutions to both camps of users, the two are still prettyfar apart.andP;  PC users, accustomed to the immediate response of a processordedicated solely to their needs, aren't eager to have their applicationsmoved to the shared processor of the mainframe.andP;  Similarly, many MISdirectors aren't wild about the idea of tying up the mainframe processor withheavily interactive applications that can degrade mainframe performance.andM;But the two worlds have been constrained by their inability to shareknowledge and power.andP;  IBM, generally recognized as the market leader in bothmainframes and micros, hopes to capitalize by eliminating this constraintwith the cooperative processing initiatives in SAA (see &quot;SAA andOfficeVision&quot; on page 83), thereby shoring up its sagging leadership in bothworlds.andP;  This push from Big Blue is the most visible move yet in theindustrywide trend toward more-sophisticated forms of micro-to-mainframeconnectivity.andM;What's Inside That Big Blue Box?andM;For the user, what's really important about a mainframe isn't nuts and boltsbut what it can do.andP;  Just as with a PC, this is function of hardware,operating systems, and applications.andM;Two operating systems, MVS and VM, dominate the IBM mainframe world.andP;  MVS,for Multiple Virtual Storage, was introduced in the early 1970s.andP;  MVS is theclassic mainframe operating environment.andP;  It effectively manages themainframe's resources among the many applications and on-line users thatcompete for the computing power of the hardware.andP;  MVS optimizes user accessby swapping work in and out of memory, thus providing virtual storage inplace of real storage.andM;An MVS-based system excels in batch-job processing.andP;  The word batch, whichhas filtered down to today's PC vocabulary, originally referred to amainframe operation in which a batch of punchedhole cards was fed into thecomputer, which then performed the tasks on the cards in sequence.andP;  Today'sbatch jobs work in a more complex way.andP;  A systems programmer uses Job ControlLanguage, or JCL, to specify the sequence of jobs and the priority MVSassigns to each.andM;JCL is just one of a host of sophisticated tools MVS offers.andP;  TSO, TimeSharing Option, gives systems programmers simultaneous access to the MVSoperating system, allowing them to write commands or applications that usethe system.andP;  MVS partitions each TSO user into a separate work area thatsimulates access to all the resources of the operating system.andP;  To provide areasonable work environment for systems programmers, MVS typically gives TSOusers a higher priority than terminal users who are simply processingtransactions.andM;CICS, for Customer Information Control System, is an interactive, on-lineprocessing system popular with institutions that handle large volumes ofon-line transactions, such as those dealing with bank accounts, insurancepolicies, and airplane tickets.andP;  CICS controls the access of multiple usersto this kind of data.andM;At Chemical Bank, for example, separate applications programs for checkingaccounts, savings accounts, CDs, and credit-card accounts reside on themainframe.andP;  &quot;We use CICS primarily as the delivery vehicle to get thisinformation to officers on the bank's branch network,&quot; says Joe Mendolia,technical manager of operating-systems development.andP;  &quot;We can link all theinformation from the various applications and present a consolidated look atthe customer's relationship with the bank via the CICS-linked terminal at thebranch.&quot;andM;VTAM, for Virtual Telecommunications Access Method, provides a transportnetwork for an on-line system running under MVS.andP;  For example, when aterminal on the network requests data, VTAM manages the request and sets upand monitors the interface between the terminal and the application.andP;  Whenrequests are made simultaneously, VTAM prioritizes them and allocates slicesof time to each so that they don't collide.andP;  It also monitors the status ofterminals, printers, minicomputers, and network components.andP;  With VTAM anapplication doesn't have to be rewritten for every piece of hardware it runson.andM;VTAM is a part of IBM's Sytems Network Architecture, or SNA, which wasintroduced in 1974.andP;  SNA works with a finite number of predefined softwarestandards called logical units, rather than with the nearly limitless typesof hardware that exist.andP;  A logical unit tells the other machines on thenetwork what capacity for communication a piece of hardware has.andP;  If thehardware--for example, a terminal--conforms to a logical unit, canparticipate in the network.andP;  Most computer peripherals produced today conformto logical unit 6.2, or LU 6.2.andP;  The older LU 2 is required for logons withthe 3270 terminals that comprise most of today's installed base.andM;Virtual MachineryandM;The VM (Virtual Machine) operating system works differently than MVS, thoughthere is significant overlap between the two.andP;  A component of VM called theControl Program manages the hardware resources of the mainframe.andP;  This allowsVM to create multiple virtual machines, each of which simulates the entiremainframe--processor, operating system, input/output peripherals, and all.andO;If you're working under VM, you have more than a chunk of the operatingsystem; you have your very own operating system on your virtual mainframe.andO;The Control Program administers the demands that the various virtual machinesmake of the hardware.andM;The implications of this system are important for certain crucial tasks.andP;  Forone thing, other operating systems, including MVS and AIX (IBM's Unixvariant), can run under VM.andM;This means that a systems programmer working on an MVS application can usehis or her virtual machine under VM to simulate an entire mainframe runningMVS.andP;  Since this virtual machine is completely separate from all othervirtual machines, a crash of the new application during testing would causethe crash of only this particular virtual machine, not the entire mainframe.andO;At the same time, an MVS batch job could run on a second virtual machinewhile the systems programmer tests the application.andP;  Meanwhile, on a thirdvirtual machine, another programmer could work on a different application torun in the VM environment.andP;  This programmer would likely be working with CMS,Conversational Monitor System.andP;  CMS provides the programmer with a window tothe VM operating system, in much the same way that TSO provides a window tothe MVS operating system.andP;  These two interfaces are about as close to theoperating system as any but the most technical user ever needs to get.andM;Many people believe that VM, with its system of independent virtual machines,is the better suited of the two predominant operating systems forapplications development.andP;  But the price of an operating system that createsa multitude of virtual machines is degradation of performance.andP;  Somecompanies for which the volume and speed of batch jobs or remotecommunications is critical have decided to forgo VM and focus their hardwareresources on MVS.andM;Mainframe DatabasesandM;An important part of the push for micro-to-mainframe connectivity technologyhas been users' impatience to access and exploit the huge amount of data thatresides in mainframe databases.andP;  DB2 is IBM's  predominant mainframe-databasesoftware for MVS systems.andP;  SQL/DS, which stands for Structured QueryLanguage/Data System, is the comparable relational-database software for VMenvironments.andM;SQL, Structured Query Language, generates queries against a mainframedatabase.andP;  (Because it isn't wedded to a particular database format, SQL hasalso become a popular all-purpose query language for many nonmainframeplatforms.)andP;  MIS professionals and some non-MIS personnel with advancedprogramming skills also use IBM's Query Management Facility, or QMF, to querymainframe databases.andP;  The Application Connection from Lotus (see&quot;Connectivity Now: 1-2-3/M and T-A-C&quot; on page 84) simplifies this process forthe spreadsheet user.andM;Mainframe database programs written for both MVS and VM by thirty-partyvendors have also gained wide acceptance.andP;  They include Information Builders'FOCUS, and Oracle Corp.'s Oracle.andP;  These programs come with their ownfront-end tools for writing queries and managing data, but they also supportSQL commands for these purposes.andM;To save a nonprogrammer the trouble of learning front-end tools to querymainframe databases, a systems programmer canuse a scripting language tocreate a program that works much like a batch file on a PC.andP;  The scriptinglanguage in MVS is called CList; its VM counterpart is called EXEC.andP;  Forexample, a program created in either of these languages might require aone-word input from the user, then perform a series of queries againstseveral mainframe databases and present the user with the result.andM;Getting to Know YouandM;If you're a user in a mainframe-oriented corporate environment, your frame ofreference is the PC or the terminal on your desk.andP;  For the last 15 years, thestandard tool for the mainframe user has been the 3270 terminal.andP;  Thecurrently dominant products in the 3270 family are the 3191 and 3192 models,but these are usually called 3270s because of their high level ofcompatibility with earlier products such as the 3278 and 3279.andP;  Because theyperform no computing tasks, 3270s and devices like them are often called dumbterminals.andP;  Their sole function is to make requests of the mainframe via akeyboard and to display the information the mainframe sends back.andP;  Coaxialcable can link as many as 32 3270s to a cluster controller (also known as aterminal controller), a piece of hardware that channels the terminals'messages to the mainframe, and vice versa.andP;  Multiple cluster controllers arelinked to themainframe.andP;  Most cluster controllers in use today are models inthe 3174 and 3274 series.andM;Soon after PCs burst onto the corporate scene, many were connected to themainframe with the help of 3270-emulation software and a board that plugsinto the PC.andP;  The leading 3270-emulation software and the board thataccompanies it, the Irma board, are so popular that Irma board has becomevirtually synonymous with the term 3270 emulator.andP;  A PC that uses anIrma-coax board to emulate a 3270 terminal can communicate with themainframe.andP;  This means that one physical unit can perform two types of tasks:PC work and communication with the mainframe.andM;PCs that are too remote to be cabled to a cluster controller can use an SDLC(Synchronous Data Link Control) board rather than a 3270-emulation board.andP;  AnSDLC board allows you to &quot;dial direct&quot; to the mainframe via a synchronousmodem.andP;  But a synchronous data link is different from the asynchronous modemtypically used with PCs.andP;  Mainframe communications is accomplished withsynchronized packets of data, rather than byte by byte.andP;  A ubiquitous exampleof SDLC communication with mainframes over dedicated phone lines is theautomated bank-teller machine.andM;For PCs connected on a local area network, or LAN, there is a third solution.andO;Up to 128 PCs on a LAN can be logged on to the mainframe at once via a singleLAN gateway.andP;  LANs with more than 128 PCs can use multiple gateways toconnect to the mainframe.andP;  The LAN concept has become increasingly popularamong corporations since the mid-1980s, but the switchover to LAN gatewayshas been gradual.andP;  &quot;You're talking about 15 years of coax strung out over thecorporate world,&quot; says Mark Browning, director of product management atDigital Communications Associates (Alpharetta, Ga.), which manufactures Irmaboards.andP;  &quot;Once the [mainframe link] is in there and it's working, unlessthere's a drive from the DP/MIS people, it tends to stay in there.&quot;andM;Only recently have advances in networking software and PC hardware increasedthe viability of a truly sophisticated micro-to-mainframe interface.andP;  In 1989shipments of PCs with 3270-emulation boards surpassed shipments of dumbterminals for the first time.andP;  This trend toward PCs isn't lost on the bigvendors pushing connectivity solutions; indeed, it is a key part of theirstrategy.andP;  IBM's OfficeVision and similar mainframe-networking applicationsare said to work on DOS-based machines and even on dumb terminals.andP;  It seemsclear, though, that high-end PCs running under OS/2 are better prepared tosupport the multitasking and graphical interfaces of such applications.andM;But the memory and storage requirements of OS/2-based PCs make them high-costitems, and this cost could limit the spread of sophisticated mainframenetworking applications like OfficeVision.andP;  Another hurdle to overcome iscommunications.andP;  Many DOS-based and dumb-terminal workstations currently inservice conform only to LU 2, not to the SAA-compliant LU 6.2 communicationsstandard.andP;  &quot;There isn't a single standard for communications yet,&quot; notesSenor of Information Builders.andM;Where Do We Go From Here?andM;Over time, upgrades will clear up hardware issues.andP;  But the future ofmicro-to-mainframe connectivity lies in the reaction of people on both sidesof the micro/mainframe chasm.andM;The micro camp may be the hardest to please because of the uneven responsetime associated with a mainframe connection.andP;  For instance, some have balkedat WordPerfect Corp.'s mainframe version of its best-selling word processor.andO;&quot;People from the interactive [PC] environment are rather appalled when theysee a mainframe [version of an existing PC product], but those who have livedwith the mainframe are rather pleased,&quot; remarks Alan C. Ashton, president ofWordPerfect.andM;Some MIS/DP professionals whose mainframe resources are already stretched mayalso be reluctant to embrace processor-consuming connectivity applications.andO;But others view them as solutions that will prove cost-effective in the longrun by delegating more of the mainframe's relatively small and simple tasksto PCs.andP;  &quot;If processing can be done in someone's office more cheaply than ona mainframe, then that's the best direction to go in, and we certainlypromote that,&quot; comments Mathesie of Chemical Bank.andM;In any case, the days of scrawling a longhand request to an overburdened MISdepartment and waiting for results are clearly numbered.andP;  &quot;They're over, inmy opinion,&quot; declares Senor.andP;  &quot;DP today is thinking, 'How can I putinformation tools into my user environments?'&quot;andM;Kelly Conatser is associate applications editor at LOTUS.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
