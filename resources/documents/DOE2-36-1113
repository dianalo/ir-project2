Self-generationof layered structured from homogeneous solution was observed. The temperature,density and supersaturation gradients, and the disappearance of convectivewaves indicated the relative stability of the layered structure. Attainingsupersaturation of the surface zone, massive crystallization, and buildupof density gradient, which follows the temperature gradient, are thenecessary conditions for the self-generation and self-maintenance ofthe laboratory pond.</TEXT></DOC>
