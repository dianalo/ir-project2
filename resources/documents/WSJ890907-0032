Despite some contentions that the dollar's rise and vigorous economic growth in the two countries offer a sound rationale for their central banks to lift key rates, most traders said the political costs of higher rates makes action in either country unlikely in the near future.    The dollar's dip, following healthy gains Friday and Tuesday, leaves the U.S. currency in a stronger position to renew its drive toward the critical two-mark level, traders said. Now that participants in the recent rally have cashed in their gains and reduced their exposure, they will be more comfortable taking new long-dollar positions, once concerns of overseas rate increases fade, they said.    &quot;It's just a matter of time before we break two marks,&quot; said Graham Broyd, vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York.    In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.9755 marks, down from 1.9883 marks Tuesday, and at 146.15 yen, down from 146.84 yen. The pound was at $1.5526, up from $1.5385.    In Tokyo Thursday, the U.S. currency opened for trading at 146.20 yen, down from Tokyo's Wednesday close of 146.65 yen.    Comments by an anonymous Bank of Japan official, who said during early Tokyo trading Wednesday that the central bank may consider action other than intervention to stem the dollar rally, marked the start of the U.S. currency's tumble. Many in the market interpreted the remark as a veiled threat that Japan will raise its discount rate or guide short-term rates higher to boost the yen.    Higher interest rates generally benefit the domestic currency by making interest-bearing instruments denominated in that currency more attractive.    Japan's central bank drove home its dissatisfaction with yen weaknesses by intervening directly to support that currency in early Tokyo trading, traders said.    But central bank Gov. Satoshi Sumita, speaking later at a news conference, downplayed the possibility of higher interest rates. Shaping monetary policy to achieve narrow foreign-exchange objectives wouldn't be appropriate, he said.    Mr. Sumita said building inflation pressures would be justification for a shift in monetary policy. He added that the Group of Seven industrial nations prefer to see the dollar below 140 yen, and affirmed the group's intentions to intervene in concert to block sharp gains in the dollar. G-7 nations include the U.S., Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada.    But without timely and concrete action to back up the threats, the Bank of Japan's posturing may quickly lose potency, said Earl I. Johnson, vice president at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago.    Although the dollar recovered from its early Tokyo lows, the currency started European trading vulnerable to further profittaking, especially with the trepidation surrounding the West German Bundesbank's Council meeting today, traders said. Some participants say the central bank will be tempted to raise key interest rates in an attempt to halt the dollar before it crosses the two-mark level.    But the Bundesbank also faces political pressure to postpone tightening credit, and a snap poll of traders gave a rate boost only a 30% chance on average.    Presuming the West German central bank leaves key interest rates untouched, traders said the dollar will recommence its recent energetic climb.    Mr. Johnson said a test of the year's high around 2.05 marks is possible during the next couple of weeks but cautioned that intervention will come fast and furious when the dollar hits two marks or approaches 150 yen.    But Dennis Pettit, vice president at PaineWebber International Ltd., New York, predicted the threat of intervention and a slew of U.S. economic indicators scheduled for release late next week will hold the dollar to near this week's highs of 1.9940 marks through tomorrow.    On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery up $2 to $361.60 an ounce in light trading. Estimated volume was 1.7 million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $360.15 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
