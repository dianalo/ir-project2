NEED IS EXPANDING  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Nearly 66 percent of the city's businesses offer some type of child carebenefits, far greater than the 15 percent nationwide, but more Palo Altobusinesses will have to lend a greater hand in the future if the city ever isto meet the overwhelming demand for child care.;    That was the conclusiondrawn from a just-completed child care survey conducted by the Stanford AlumniConsulting Team. That report will be reviewed by the city council in comingweeks.;    &quot;This report paints a picture of real need,&quot; said David Martin,child care coordinator. &quot;We need to bring businesses and employers into thepicture more. Then maybe we will have a system that works for us all.&quot;;   Businesses offer a variety of child care benefits, including costreimbursements, referral services, leave time to care for sick children andflex time. They have an incentive to offer such services because many are taxdeductible.;    On top of that, the city spends $395,000 annually onchild-care subsidies for residents. The cost of child care in Palo Alto isamong the highest in the state, Martin said.;    But it is not enough. Thereare 1,700 children on waiting lists for child-care programs, according to thereport.;    And of the 3,000 child-care slots in the city, 40 percent aretaken by children whose parents do not live in Palo Alto but work here,according to the report.;    That is why businesses in particular need to takea more active role, Martin said. Some are doing just that.;    Already, thePalo Alto Medical Foundation has proposed leasing for $1 a year 12,500 squarefeet of its property to a non-profit, child-care consortium to build a childcare center downtown.;    Law firms in the Page Mill Road and El Camino Realarea are trying to establish a child care center there. And businesses at theStanford Research Park are meeting with city officials to try to set up anon-site child-care center there.;    &quot;The report indicates we have an awfullot of work to do, even in a city like Palo Alto with a lot of resources,&quot;said Rachel Samoff, member of the city's child care task force and director ofthe Syntex child care center. &quot;More resources have to be devoted. The publicsector needs to do a lot more. And businesses certainly have a role to play,as well.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CAROLYN JUNG, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910109  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  481  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, January 9, 199100009288,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
