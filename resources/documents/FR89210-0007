An expiration date of July 31, 1987, was proposed for the reducedtolerance. Subsequently, the Agency reduced the tolerance in 40 CFR 180.246in a <T4>Federal Register </T4>document of January 16, 1987 (52 FR 1909). Themodified tolerance was set to expire on July 31, 1987, unless extended.The sole registrant of products containing daminozide, Uniroyal ChemicalCo., Inc., 74 Amity Rd., Bethany, CT 06525, submitted pesticide petition(PP) 7F3535 proposing an extension of the tolerance for residues of theplant growth regulator daminozide in or on the raw agricultural commodityapples at 20 ppm. EPA issued a notice, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of June 17, 1987 (52 FR 23077), announcing receiptof this petition. The petition was submitted under section 408(d)(1) and408(m) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). Following Agencyreview of this petition, a final rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of July 29, 1987 (52 FR 28256), continuing thetolerance of 20 ppm for residues of daminozide in or on apples throughJanuary 31, 1989. The Agency imposed expiration dates for the apple tolerancebecause it was hoped that as data were received, a regulatory decisioncould be made prior to the completion of the long-term oncogenicity studies.On September 8, 1988, Uniroyal Chemical Company submitted PP 8F3684 proposingan extension of the tolerance for residues of daminozide in or on applesat 20 ppm. EPA issued a notice, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of October 20, 1988 (53 FR 41238) announcingsubmission of this petition.There were no comments received in response to the notice of filing.The potential oncogenic risk of daminozide and UDMH has for some time beenunder evaluation by the Agency. As previously discussed in greater detailin <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices of January 16, 1987 (52 FR 1909) andJuly 29, 1987 (52 FR 28256), certain oncogenicity studies indicate thatdaminozide and its impurity and hydrolysis product, UDMH, cause an increasedincidence of malignant and benign tumors in laboratory animals under testconditions. However, these studies had certain flaws in test methodologyand documentation. As a result of these flaws, EPA eventually concludedthat these studies could not serve as a basis for regulatory action againstdaminozide. (See 52 FR 28256; July 29, 1987.) Extensive data requirementswere imposed on Uniroyal Chemical Company under section 3(c)(2)(B) of theFederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). These datarequirements included: Oncogenicity studies with daminozide and unsymmetricaldimethyl hydrazine (UDMH), mutagenicity data, plant and animal metabolismstudies, livestock feeding data, crop field trials, degradation in fooddata, storage stability information, market basket surveys, and analyticalmethods. The majority of these required studies have been received andhave been reviewed. Results of crop field trials, analytical methods, anda market basket survey are discussed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of July 29, 1987 (52 FR 28256), along with additionalbackground information on the regulatory interaction between the Agencyand the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) on daminozide.Evaluation of residue chemistry data on UDMH and daminozide indicates thatthe Agency currently has sufficient data to perform an adequate dietaryexposure analysis for a risk assessment. EPA currently has residue datafrom crop field trials for cherries, nectarines, peaches, pears, and tomatoes;market basket survey data for apples, cherry filling peanuts, peanut butter,grape juice, baby and adult apple juice, and sauce; and feeding studiesfor meat, milk, and eggs. However, the Agency is still seeking additionalinformation on the degradation of daminozide into UDMH in apple juice andsauce since previously submitted degradation studies report conflictingresults. An additional degradation study, along with additional informationon storage stability and plant and animal metabolism, will be submittedin 1989.Oncogenicity studies with daminozide in the rat and mouse were submittedon August 31, 1988. A preliminary review of the rat (Fischer 344) studyshows it to be negative for oncogenicity. Treated animals showed no statisticallysignificant increase in tumors by either the Cochran Armitage trend analysisa (a statistical recognition of a positive increase in tumors with increasingdose) or the Fisher's exact test (statistical comparison of two groups,also preferred to as pairwise comparison).Preliminary review of the daminozide mouse (CD-1) study indicates thatthere is a statistically significant increase in hemangiosarcomas/hemangiomas(malignant and benign blood vessel tumors, respectively) with increasingdose (Cochran Armitage trend test) but not by pairwise comparison. Theincidence of these tumors is summarized in the following table.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Daminozide Mouse Study Incidence of Blood Vessel Tumors </T4><H1> </H1><H1>Dosage levels (ppm) </H1><H2>0 </H2><H2>300 </H2><H2>3,000 </H2><H2>6,000 </H2><H2>10,000</H2>Males:<ITAG tagnum="3">Hemangiomas </ITAG><D>\1\ 2/50(4) </D><D>0/50(0) </D><D>2/50(4) </D><D>1/50(2) </D><D>2/48(4)</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Hemangiosarcomas </ITAG><D>4/50(8) </D><D>1/50(2) </D><D>1/50(2) </D><D>2/50(4) </D><D>8/48(17)</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Combined incidence </ITAG><D>6/50(12) </D><D>1/50(2) </D><D>3/50(6) </D><D>3/50(6) </D><D>10/48(21)</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="27">p=0.01 by the Cochran Armitage Test</ITAG><R>n,sandCx.3;</R>Females:<ITAG tagnum="3">Hemangiomas </ITAG><D>2/46(4) </D><D>0/49(0) </D><D>1/49(2) </D><D>1/47(2) </D><D>1/50(2)</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Hemangiosarcomas </ITAG><D>2/46(4) </D><D>1/49(2) </D><D>1/49(2) </D><D>0/47(0) </D><D>6/50(12)</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Combined incidence </ITAG><D>4/46(9) </D><D>1/49(2) </D><D>2/49(4) </D><D>1/47(2) </D><D>7/50(14)</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="27">p=0.048 by the Cochran Armitage Test</ITAG><F>\1\ The number in parentheses indicates the percentage incidence.</F></ITAG>  The increase in hemangiosarcomas/hemangiomas at the high dose in male andfemale mice is considered to be related to treatment with daminozide forthe following reasons: (1) Tumors at the high dose are nearly twice thoseof the concurrent controls. (2) The incidence of hemangiosarcomas at thehigh dose is outside of the historical control range for this tumor typein this strain of mouse. The historical control range for hemangiosarcomasis 0 to 2.0 percent (mean 0.5 percent) for males and 0 percent for femalesin four feeding studies performed at the same laboratory as the daminozidestudy. Hemangiosarcomas would be considered uncommon tumors (andless;1.0percent) based on these ranges in the CD-1 mouse. (3) The incidence ofhemangiosarcomas in the control groups is also outside the historical controlrange for this tumor type. An explanation for this is not readily apparent,but raises a question about the adequacy of the control groups, especiallyfor male mice since in the two lowest dosage groups the incidence was withinthe historical control range. Since this is an uncommon tumor, the Agencyhas required Uniroyal Chemical Company to submit the pathology slides fromboth the daminozide and UDMH studies for further review. (4) Hemangiosarcomas/hemagiomasare the same tumor types seen in the ongoing oncogenicity studies on UDMH.Low levels of UDMH present either as a contaminant of the daminozide beingtested or present as the result of metabolism or daminozide to UDMH inthe test animals could be contributing to the formation of these tumorsin the daminozide study.In addition to oncogenicity studies with daminozide, 2-year drinking wateroncogenicity studies in the rat (Fischer 344) and mouse (CD-1) using UDMHhave been required and are in progress.A 12-month interim sacrifice report of 20 animals per sex per dose levelon the rat study has been submitted to the Agency. This study providesexposures to rats of up to 100 ppm UDMH in drinking water. A preliminaryreview of this report indicates that no tumors related to UDMH exposurewere found after 1 year of treatment.The CD-1 mouse is being tested in two studies at several dosage levels.In one study, the ``low dose'' study, UDMH is being administered at 0,1, 5, and 10 ppm in male mice and 0, 1, 5, and 20 ppm in female mice. Thisstudy began in mid-January 1987, and the terminal sacrifice was scheduledfor mid-January 1989. The 1-year ``low dose'' study interim sacrifice dataindicate that there is no numerical increase in any tumor type in any ofthe treatment groups. A draft pathology report is due in April 1989, anda final report is due in July 1989.In a second CD-1 mouse ``high dose'' study, UDMH is being administeredat 0, 40, and 80 ppm to both male and female mice. The study began in mid-May1987, and the terminal sacrifice is scheduled for mid-May 1989. A draftpathology report is due in September 1989, and the final study report isdue January 1990. The 1-year interim sacrifice data indicate that thereis a statistically significant increase in hemangiosarcomas/hemangiomasat the high dose by pair-wise comparison and by trend analysis (Cochran-Armitagetest) for both males and females. The Agency notes that only one tumorwas found in either sex at the 40-ppm dosage level following 1 year ofexposure. Since the tumors were found early in the study, i.e., at 1 year),the Agency considers it likely that further tumors at the 40-ppm level(and possibly at lower doses) could be found at termination of the studyat the end of 2 years.The data on the incidence of hemangiosarcomas/hemangiomas are summarizedin the following table along with data on lung tumors seen in this samestudy.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>UDMH ``High Dose'' Mouse Study Incidence of Blood Vessel and Lung Tumors</T4><H1>Tumor type</H1><H1>Dosage level (ppm) </H1><H2>0 </H2><H2>40 </H2><H2>80</H2> <ITAG tagnum="21">Males</ITAG>Blood vessel:<ITAG tagnum="2">Hemangioma <D/>a 0/45(0) <D>1/45(2) </D><D>2/53(4) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Hemangiosarcoma <D>0/45(0) </D><D>0/45(0) </D><D>9/53(18) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Combined <D>\3\ 0/45(0) </D><D>1/45(2) </D><D>\3\ 11/53(22) </D></ITAG>Lung: <ITAG tagnum="12">Alveolar/bronchiolar: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Adenomas </ITAG><D>6/45(13) </D><D>11/45(24) </D><D>22/53(41) </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Adenocarcinoma </ITAG><D>0/45(0) </D><D>0/45(0) </D><D>1/53(2) </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Combined </ITAG><D>\3\ 6/45(13) </D><D>11/45(24) </D><D>\3\ 23/53(43) </D><ITAG tagnum="21">Females</ITAG>Blood vessel:<ITAG tagnum="2">Hemangioma <D>0/43(0) </D><D>1/47(2) </D><D>2/51(4) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Hemangiosarcoma <D>0/43(0) </D><D>0/47(0) </D><D>6/51(12) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Combined <D>\3\ 0/43(0) </D><D>1/47(2) </D><D>\3\ 8/51(16) </D></ITAG>Lung: <ITAG tagnum="12">Alveolar/bronchiolar: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Adenomas </ITAG><D>4/44(9) </D><D>13/47(30) </D><D>19/51(37) </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Adenocarcinoma </ITAG><D>0/44(0) </D><D>1/47(2) </D><D>0/51(0) </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Combined </ITAG><D>\3\ 4/44(9) </D><D>\1\ 14/47(32) </D><D>\2\ 19/51(37) </D><F/>a The number in parentheses indicates the percentage incidence.<F>\1\ pandless;0.05. </F><F>\2\ pandless;0.01. </F><F>\3\ pandless;0.001.</F><F/><T4>Note._</T4>Significance of trend denoted at control group (CochranArmitage Test).

New mutagenicity studies using UDMH have been submitted to the Agency.These studies include an Ames Salmonella assay for point mutations, a chromosomalaberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary cells, a forward gene mutationassay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and an unscheduled DNA synthetaseassay in primary rat hepatocytes. All four of these studies were foundto be acceptable assays and to be equivocal to negative for mutagenicity.Based on the incidences of hemangiosarcomas/hemangiomas seen at 80 ppmin the UDMH mouse study at 1 year, the Agency has calculated a cancer potencyfactor (Q*<T2>1</T2>) of 0.88 milligrams/kilogram/day^1. In addition, a Q*<T2>1</T2> of 2.9 mg/kg/day^1 was calculated based on the incidence oflung tumors seen at the interim sacrifice in this same study. Since thelung tumors were of a nonmalignant nature and not yet shown to be outsidethe normally high incidence of lung tumors found in this strain of mouseafter 2 years, the Q*<T2>1</T2> for malignant vascular tumors was used for risk characterization.The model used for calculating the Q*<T2>1</T2> for both data sets was the multistage model using the CrumpGlobal 86 program. This model fits both data sets very well.The Agency has used data from crop field trials and several market basketsurveys as well as tolerance level values for milk intake to estimate anexposure and risk characterization for UDMH.Based upon this information, the Agency has preliminarily estimated thatexposure to individuals in the U.S. population is 0.000051 mg/kg/day ofUDMH (mean exposure). The lifetime risk to human beings over a 70 yearperiod has been calculated to be 4.5andmultiply;10^5. This results in anindividual risk of 9.6andmultiply;10^7 over a 1.5-year period, the lengthof the tolerance extension. However, exposure to UDMH is not constant overthe 70 year lifespan. Because consumption patterns vary from infancy toadulthood and because infants consume more per unit body weight than adults,nonnursing infants (children under one year of age) have a greater exposureduring that year than do adults. This exposure has been estimated to be0.00048 mg/kg/day (mean exposure). Therefore, the Agency has also estimatedthe risk to the nonnursing infant for 1.5 years. It is calculated to be9andmultiply;10^6. The risk to nonnursing infants was calculated by firstdetermining estimated exposure for the duration of the tolerance extensionperiod, 1.5 years, and then multiplying the exposure value by the cancerpotency factor, 0.88 mg/kg/day^1. Thus, to determine risk, the Agency dividedthe daily exposure (0.00048 mg/kg/day) by 70 (the Agency's usual assumedlife span for cancer risk assessment), multiplied by 1.5 and then multipliedthe resulting exposure value for nonnursing infants by the cancer potencyfactor. It should be noted that the resulting risk may be overstated becausethe nonnursing infant daily exposure estimates are for 1 year, not 1.5years. As children grow, their absolute consumption and consumption perunit body weight of apple products decreases thereby lowering UDMH exposure.This trend is supported by mean consumption estimates from the Agency'sTolerance Assessment System food consumption data base. The general populationrisk (9.6andmultiply;10^7) was calculated using the same procedure and anestimated exposure value of 0.000051 mg/kg/day.These risk estimates are the best indicator of oncogenic risk availableat this time. Strengths of these risk estimates are: (1) Hemangiosarcomasare uncommon malignant tumor and have a low background rate in the strainof mouse used in the UDMH and daminozide studies; (2) hemangiosarcomasare the same tumor type seen in earlier UDMH studies that had flaws intest methodology and documentation: (3) it is very likely that a dose-responserelationship will result for the occurrence of hemangiosarcomas/hemangiomasafter termination of the UDMH mouse study at 2 years; (4) items (1), (2),and (3) of this paragraph support using the potency factor calculated usingthe blood vessel tumor data instead of the lung tumor data; and (5) residuedata are primarily actual residue data and not worst-case assumptions basedon tolerances. However, there are also limitations to the Agency's approach for risk estimation.These limitations are as follows: (1) Since the final results of thesestudies are not yet available, the actual tumor response over a lifetimeis not known; (2) although biological and statistical trends were noted,tests at 10,000 ppm for two years with the parent compound were statisticallynegative by pairwise comparison for cancer response; (3) the cancer responsein the current UDMH data is seen only in one species at 40 and 80 ppm (40ppm, or approximately 11.5 mg/kg/day, 80 ppm, or approximately 23 mg/kg/day);(4) mutagenicity data for UDMH are equivocal to negative on most of thetest animals reported on in the interim sacrifice report died ``in study''rather than at sacrifice indicating an early occurrence of tumors fromexposure to UDMH; (5) mice in the ``high dose'' study are dying early andit is only at the highest dose of this study, 80 ppm UDMH, that a statisticallysignificant biological response has been seen. The Agency believes thatthe death of these mice is due to the tumors, but it may be argued thatthe maximum tolerated dose has been exceeded, causing excessive toxicityand thereby compromising the outcome of the study. The final results fromthe ``low dose'' study will indicate whether tumors are occurring at lowerdosage levels as well, and may enable the Agency to determine if excessivetoxicity is a limiting factor in the interpretations of tumor data. TheAgency believes that these questions will be resolved when the final reportsof the low dose and high dose studies are received, which is July 1989and January 1990 respectively.It is the Agency's policy to coordinate its actions regarding the revocationof tolerances for pesticide chemicals under the FFDCA with its actionsregarding the cancellation of corresponding registrations of pesticidesunder FIFRA. A Statement of Policy was published by EPA in 1982, on thissubject (47 FR 42956; Sept. 29, 1982) which reflects the joint understandingof the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture,and EPA that EPA ordinarily will not revoke a tolerance until the correspondingregistration(s) have been cancelled, nor until the end of any period providedby the final cancellation order for use of existing stocks of the pesticide(47 FR 42958; Sept. 29, 1982). That document also states that time EPAwill issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to revoke a tolerance at theEPA issues a notice of intent to cancel a corresponding registration sothat a final rule revoking a tolerance, if appropriate, can be issued atthe time the associated registrations are cancelled (or shortly thereafter). The underlying basis of the 1982 policy statement is that a food producerordinarily should be able to assume correctly that using a pesticide ona crop in accordance with an EPA-approved FIFRA registration will not resultin the seizure of the crop as failing to conform with a tolerance regulationissued by EPA under FFDCA. EPA continues to believe that this policy issound.As already noted the data available at this time have certain limitations.Review of the pathology studies from both the daminozide and UDMH studies,and of the final reports of the low and high dose UDMH studies should resolvesome of the uncertainties associated with the evaluation and interpretationof the data available now.Despite these limitations, the Agency believes that the lifetime risksto the U.S. population estimated from the available data (4.5andmultiply;10^5)are of sufficient concern that it should move as quickly as possible towardcancellation of daminozide through the Special Review process. Accordingly,the Agency intends to issue a Preliminary Determination proposing cancellationthis spring.The final reports from the low and high dose UDMH studies will be availableand can be reflected in the Agency's Final Determination. The Final Determination,likely to be issued in the spring of 1990, will be issued before expirationof the tolerance on July 31, 1990. As part of its Special Review action,EPA also intends to propose revocation of daminozide tolerances on theremaining crops beside this apple tolerance.Based on currently available data and the incremental individual risk estimateas a result of the tolerance extension, EPA concludes that a tolerancelevel of 20 ppm for residues of daminozide in or on apples, during theperiod ending July 31, 1990, is adequate to protect the public health.Any person adversely affected by this regulation extending the 20-ppm tolerancefor residues of daminozide on apples may, within 30 days after publicationof this regulation in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk,at the address given above, and may as part of such objections requesta hearing on factual issues associated with such objections. Objectionsshould specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable andthe ground for the objections. If a hearing is requested, the request muststate the factual issues to be addressed in the hearing.In the event that objections or requests for a hearing are filed, thistolerance rule will remain effective until issuance of any order resultingfrom such objections or requests. (Section 408(d)(4), FFDCA.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, the Agency must determine whether a regulatoryaction is ``major'' and therefore subject to the requirements of a RegulatoryImpact Analysis. The Agency had determined that this regulatory actionis not a major regulatory action, i.e., it will not have an annual effecton the economy of at least $100 million, will not cause a major increasein prices, and will not have a significant adverse effect on competitionor the ability of U.S. enterprises to compete with foreign enterprises.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>This rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980(Pub.
