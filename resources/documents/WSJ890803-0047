With a terrorist group in Lebanon threatening to kill American hostage Joseph Cicippio today unless Israel releases a Moslem cleric it has kidnapped, the Navy began moving ships in the direction of Lebanon and Iran. The U.S. has warned it will hold Iran responsible if its Lebanese followers harm Mr. Cicippio.    The U.S. has at least 23 warships in the Mediterranean and another carrier battle group steaming toward the Mideast, so President Bush will have practically every possible military option at the ready if force is needed in the hostage crisis.    The president and his aides played down the moves and emphasized that they are focusing on other government business. Nevertheless, the administration continued frantic efforts to use diplomatic pressure to protect the hostages; it continues to send blunt diplomatic messages to Iran and Syria insisting that they use their influence over Mr. Cicippio's captors to save his life.    Administration officials acknowledged that any military options are severely limited by a shortage of hard information about where hostages are held in the shadowy world of Shiite-dominated southern Lebanon. Moreover, there are no obvious bases or buildings where the U.S. can be sure important terrorist leaders reside or work.    Mr. Bush himself vented his frustration in a brief public comment to reporters. &quot;We're dealing with less than a full deck when it comes to information,&quot; Mr. Bush said. &quot;It is very hard when you're dealing with this kind of cowardice and this kind of dastardly act to get all the information that you need to make a decision. . . . We are not dealing with all the facts.&quot;    The frustration is surfacing on Capitol Hill as well. Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) questioned whether the U.S. had enough intelligence-gatherers in the Middle East. And by a voice vote, the Senate adopted an amendment to the pending Pentagon spending bill requiring that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Central Intelligence Director William Webster report to Congress by Sept. 1 on efforts to locate and free the remaining hostages.    In the hostage crisis, the U.S. is facing its toughest intelligence problem -- how to penetrate small groups of terrorists who are often members of extended families, and to anticipate their moves. American analysts say the hostages probably are being kept mostly in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a lawless region that hasn't had any government for several years.    &quot;I'm sure they're terribly frustrated right now. You want to get something done, but you can't because there's too much you don't know,&quot; says Clay McManaway, who until April 30 was the deputy to the chief of counter-terrorism at the State Department. &quot;The U.S. has never had precise information about the whereabouts of the captors and the hostages in time to act on it.&quot;    Despite the difficulties, though, Mr. Bush will find it hard to resist pressure for action if there is a credible claim that Mr. Cicippio is killed today, just three days after Shiite terrorists claimed to have killed Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins.    There seems little chance that Israel will defuse the situation by releasing Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a Shiite cleric and a leader of Hezbollah, the Iranian-inspired Shiite terrorist organization in south Lebanon, whose kidnapping set off the latest round of threats against hostages. Releasing the sheik would appear to be a capitulation to Hezbollah and the terrorist cells related to it, and the U.S. emphasized that it isn't demanding that.    So the administration is escalating military preparations in case Mr. Bush decides to strike. The battleship Iowa left its anchorage at Marseille yesterday and moved into the Mediterranean.    In addition, the Pentagon yesterday said another aircraft carrier, the America, cut short a port visit in Singapore and was heading to an undisclosed location with seven accompanying ships. And the guided missile cruiser Belknap, flagship of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, was diverted from a planned visit to the Black Sea.    The Navy never discloses the exact deployments of its ships, but Pentagon officials made it clear that these vessels were moving into positions where they could be used if needed in this crisis. U.S. officials say those moves are precautionary and shouldn't be read as an indicator of imminent military steps to either free hostages or punish their captors. The officials insist the U.S. focus is on diplomacy.    In the wake of the reported murder of Col. Higgins, the U.S. has sent messages to Iran's leaders saying it expects them to use their influence to prevent Shiite extremists from killing more hostages. The U.S. has cast a wide diplomatic net, asking a variety of other nations to deliver the same message to Iran and to Syria, which controls the area where many of Lebanon's Shiite terrorist cells operate.    Still, U.S. officials could be playing down the possibility of military action to prevent tipping their hand to terrorist leaders. Possible military options range from bombings and Marine amphibious landings to small &quot;surgical strikes&quot; by precision-guided cruise missiles or by commandos from a U.S. special forces unit.    The key player if military options are chosen will be Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has been arriving each morning at the White House carrying a large leather portfolio, the kind architects carry blueprints in.    Options and maps are prepared by the joint chiefs' Operations' Directorate, a body of planners that has been developing and updating military options in Lebanon for years. According to senior defense officials, Adm. Crowe and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney agree on possible options and then present them to the National Security Council.    When it gets down to the details, Adm. Crowe's expertise and knowledge of the area could be be crucial. In the mid-1970s, he headed the Navy's Middle East Task Force in the Persian Gulf. Later, he was commander in chief of allied forces in southern Europe, which includes the Mediterranean. &quot;He really knows the nuts and bolts,&quot; commented one official.    ---   Walter S.
