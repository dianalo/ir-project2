WAKIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The operations of the country's first laborgroup placed under government control were returned to allies of theformer mob-dominated leadership of Teamsters Local 560 following afinal tally of votes today.   The Teamsters for Liberty ticket, a strong, well organized groupwhose candidates are related to two barred union leaders, won 65percent of the vote after the 4,530 ballots were counted, accordingto state Board of Mediation officials.   Teamsters for Liberty outpolled the rival United New Beginningparty by 2,842 votes to 1,535, officials said.   Despite the kinship of leaders between the new group and the old,a government trustee of the union said he saw progress in Tuesday'svote.   ``The question, and ultimately the success of the trusteeship, iswhether the process continues or whether the freedom these peoplehave created is destroyed,'' said Edwin H. Stier, a former federaland state prosecutor who was appointed trustee of the 7,600-memberunion when the government took over.   But Stier said that after talking with all the parties, he wasconfident ``everybody is going to try to run this union in aprogressive way.''   The local is one of the largest in the nation and was taken overby the government 2{ years ago to purge it of organized crime.   The winning slate of candidates included Danny Sciarra and MarkSheridan, the brother and nephew, respectively, of former localleaders Michael Sciarra and Joseph Sheridan.   Michael Sciarra and Joseph Sheridan served as interim officersduring appeals of the government takeover. When a federal judgebarred them this fall from running in the election because of theirlinks to the old regime, they nominated their kin to become officers.   The government said Michael Sciarra was the designated heir ofthe Genovese organized crime family. He has denied any involvementin organized crime.   The losing slate was backed by an independent, rank-and-filemovement and represented opponents of the union's former officersfrom the 1960s.   ``We put up a fight,'' said Ray Carney, who opposed Sciarra forpresident. ``You got a lot to overcome. We don't have the money theyhave.''   Carney, who lost the last contested election 23 years ago, was afriend of a murdered Local 560 dissident, Anthony Castellito, whowas garroted with piano wire at the direction of ousted unionofficial Anthony ``Tony Pro'' Provenzano.   U.S. District Judge Harold A. Ackerman, in ruling in favor in1984 of the Justice Department's racketeering lawsuit seeking toremove the local's executive board, wrote, ``This group ofgangsters, aided and abetted by their relatives and sycophants,engaged in a multifaceted orgy of criminal activity.''   The union was dominated by the Provenzano group, an allegedfaction of the Genovese organized crime group. The three Provenzanobrothers _ Anthony, Salvatore and Nunzio _ all have been jailed fora variety of crimes, including racketeering and extortion.</TEXT></DOC>
