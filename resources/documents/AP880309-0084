The unusual move Tuesday by Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markhamdelayed consideration of whether the defense will get thedocuments. Several of the defense lawyers, charging that thegovernment improperly withheld evidence, asked that the case bedismissed.   LaRouche, six followers and five LaRouche politicalorganizations all are charged with conspiring to cover up allegedcredit card fraud by LaRouche supporters during his 1984presidential campaign. Four of the organizations are charged withfraud.   Markham told U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton he could notrepresent the FBI because of a conflict of interest with his roleas prosecutor. Markham did not elaborate, but said the conflictwould be resolved before a hearing scheduled for this afternoon.   At that hearing, the FBI either might have to drop its requestor present evidence that releasing the documents would bedetrimental to national security. Keeton deferred ruling on thedismissal motions until after the questions about access to the FBIrecords is resolved.   One of the defense lawyers sought the FBI documents afterobtaining a May 1986 memo that involves two key players in theIran-Contra scandal and mentions an apparent effort to collectinformation damaging to LaRouche.   In the memo, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord toldMarine Lt. Col. Oliver North, the National Security Council aidefired for his role in the Iran-Contra affair, that ``our man hereclaims Lewis has collected info against LaRouche.''   Defense lawyer William Moffitt said Markham told him ``our man''referred to Oliver Revell, the FBI's executive assistant director.Markham refused to confirm that. Moffitt also said he had confirmedthat ``Lewis'' was a retired Army major, Fred Lewis.   The memo, found in North's safe, was surrendered to LaRouchedefense lawyers after the special prosecutor investigating thescandal acknowledged its existence.   Secord, reached Tuesday in Washington, said he could not recallthe memo but never crossed paths with LaRouche. Secord was one ofNorth's principal operatives in the network of private aid to theanti-Nicaraguan Contras.   Defense lawyers contend that the Reagan administration plottedto ruin LaRouche, who is seeking the 1988 Democratic presidentialnomination in his fourth run for the White House. He faces up tofive years in prison if convicted.   Prosecutors deny defense contentions that the governmentinfilitrated LaRouche's organzations and concocted a credit cardfraud scheme to destroy LaRouche and his following.   The defense, however, has presented evidence in recent weeksthat the FBI had infiltrated LaRouche organizations as recently as1985.   Keeton told Markham he wants an explanation as to why defenselawyers, through Freedom of Information Act requests, have learnedof the existence of thousands of other FBI documents mentioningLaRouche but not turned over to defense lawyers before the trial.</TEXT></DOC>
