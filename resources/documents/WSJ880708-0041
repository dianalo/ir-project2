Amid widespread allegations of electoral fraud and in the absence of an official vote count, Mr. Salinas yesterday afternoon told a packed auditorium of supporters that his victory was &quot;evident and undoubted.&quot; But he conceded that the opposition presidential candidates had carried several regions of the country and that the opposition also had won a historic number of victories in the Senate, where an opposition member has never served, and in the chamber of deputies.    &quot;The age of a practically single-party {system} is over,&quot; Mr. Salinas said, &quot;and we are now entering a new political era . . . with a majority party and very intense competition from the opposition.&quot;    At a time of deep economic distress and growing demands for more democracy in Mexico, Mr. Salinas, the 40-year-old former budget minister, endured the greatest challenge to a ruling party candidate in five decades, particularly from a revitalized political left. The PRI won every presidential election in its 59-year history.    Mr. Salinas, a Harvard-trained economist, made the pledge of &quot;clean, transparent&quot; elections the centerpiece of his electoral campaign, but faced resistance from PRI hard-liners. Even before the polls closed on Wednesday evening, the three leading opposition candidates went before the government electoral commission and claimed that the election results were tainted by fraud. The three candidates were Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, of the leftist National Democratic Front; Manuel J. Clouthier, of the conservative National Action Party, or PAN; and Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, of the radical Revolutionary Workers Party.    In an unusual display of unity, the opposition leaders issued a joint statement saying that unless the government rectified &quot;numerous violations&quot; the three parties wouldn't &quot;accept the results, nor recognize the authorities that originate from fraudulent actions.&quot;    The three opposition leaders didn't specify what actions they would take if their complaints aren't satisfied. But the PAN for months has been preparing a campaign of civil disobedience against the government in the event of electoral fraud.    The National Democratic Front cited some 3,000 alleged incidents of fraud, ranging from stolen ballot boxes in opposition strongholds to voting-booth administrators allowing PRI sympathizers to cast ballots several times.    The allegations of fraud intensified late Wednesday when the electoral commission announced that the computers tabulating the vote had broken down, preventing the expected release of results the night of the elections. The commission attributed the breakdown to a record voter turnout.    But the delay in releasing the results -- which still weren't made public by yesterday evening -- raised growing speculation that the opposition had made a much stronger showing than the PRI wanted to acknowledge. &quot;The only logical explanation for this lengthy delay is that the results coming through were entirely unacceptable to the party,&quot; said Jorge G. Castaneda, a prominent Mexican political writer.    Added M. Delal Baer, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington: &quot;The delay in the tabulation tells me that the results were possibly surprising to the PRI and that they needed some time to consider how to manage their situation.&quot;    As the campaign ended, polls indicated that Mr. Cardenas, the son of one of Mexico's most-revered presidents, was rapidly gaining support. One poll, taken on the eve of the election, gave Mr. Cardenas the lead over Mr. Salinas in the Mexican capital. The same poll showed Mr. Salinas's support nationally falling well below 50%, which would be a stunning embarrassment for the ruling PRI.    In the absence of official results, Mr. Cardenas presented his own partial count, which showed him winning 44% of the vote in Mexico City, compared to 27.2% for Mr. Salinas and 23.4% for Mr. Clouthier. Whatever the final count, the undeniable appeal demonstrated by Mr. Cardenas's populist message could influence the policies pursued by Mr. Salinas. The core of Mr. Cardenas's campaign platform was a tougher stance against the foreign creditors who hold Mexico's $105 billion debt.    &quot;A powerful left could move Salinas to the left in policy terms,&quot; said Ms. Baer, the Mexico analyst. &quot;This election is sending him a very strong message that he may not be able to ignore.&quot; It also appeared that the opposition parties might have won enough local elections to put some vigor and independence into the federal legislature, long a rubber-stamp for the president. </TEXT></DOC>
