Arnold Lokshin's comments, carried in Monday's editions ofPravda, offered a rare glimpse into the life of one of the fewWest-to-East defectors.   Since leaving the United States 3{ years ago, Lokshin hasdeclined to speak to American reporters and has dropped from thesight of the foreign community.   Pravda said he runs a government cancer research laboratory andlives with his wife and three children in a three-room apartment onNovocheremushkinsky Street in southern Moscow.   His wife, Lauren, keeps house and looks after the children:Jeffrey, in ninth grade, Michael, in second grade, and Jennifer, astudent in the Mikhail Lomonsov Chemical Institute, the CommunistParty daily said.   The article did not say how the Lokshins were coping with thehardships and consumer shortages of life in the Soviet Union.   In the Pravda interview, Lokshin voiced political views thatappeared conservative in the context of the reform movementsweeping the country.   He stood up at a political meeting in Moscow last week and said:``We are often asked, `What did you find in the Soviet Union thatyou least expected?''' the report said.   ``We never expected that an American family in the Soviet Unionwould be defending the October Revolution, socialism, and theteachings of Lenin,'' Pravda quoted him as saying. Vladimir I.Lenin led the October Revolution that forged the Soviet state in1917.   ``We aren't tourists here. We came a long time ago, and we aregetting our feet on the ground. Therefore, we feel like part ofyour society, and not sideline observers,'' Lokshin said.   ``At the same time, we realize perfectly well that we do nothave the right to interfere in your internal affairs. After all, weare still citizens of the United States,'' Lokshin said.   Lokshin, then 47, fled with his family to the Soviet Union inOctober 1986, saying he had been a Communist Party organizer andhad been fired as head of St. Joseph Hospital's Cancer ResearchInstitute in Houston because of his political views.   His former employers said he was fired because of jobperformance.   ``When we came to the Soviet Union, we had no illusions,''Lokshin said. ``Our departure from the U.S.A. was necessary, anextreme step. And we did not expect to find such a heartfelt, warmwelcome in the Soviet Union.''   ``We now have quite a few friends among the Soviet people, withwhom we can openly discuss the most varied problems,'' agreeingwith some, disagreeing with others, Lokshin said.   And he regretted that some people with whom it was impossible todiscuss politics ``unfortunately, still hold positions ofresponsibility. Unfortunately, bureaucratism is still strong.''</TEXT></DOC>
