The paper published by the congressional Office of TechnologyAssessment also said that while most public concern has focused onhigh-voltage transmission lines, more attention should be paid toexposure to such fields from other sources including householdwiring and appliances.   ``It is now clear that 60 Hz (cycles per second) and other lowfrequency electromagnetic fields can interact with individual cellsand organs to produce biological changes,'' the study said. ``Thenature of these interactions for public health remain unclear, butthere are legitimate reasons for concern.''   The background paper was prepared for OTA by three researchers _Indira Nair, M. Granger Morgan and H. Keith Florig _ affiliated withthe Department of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie MellonUniversity.   It noted that concerns about health effects of high-powertransmission lines ``have prompted vigorous public intervention andlitigation which has significantly impeded the ability of privateand public utilities to construct new power transmission facilities.   Without adequate research to provide answers to this problem,``the resulting contention could go on for many years and have costssignificantly greater than the costs of the needed research,'' thereport said.   The paper said research on so-called power frequencyelectromagnetic fields should include a balanced mixture ofcellular-level studies aimed at examining biological mechanisms,whole animal studies and human epidemiological studies.   The brain and central nervous system, it said, are ``naturalcandidates for interaction with fields'' because they themselvesutilize low frequency fields for cellular communication andfunctioning. The report said a ``carefully planned research agenda''is needed in this area.   On the sensitive issue of whether there may be an associationbetween exposure to extremely low frequency (ELF) fields and theoccurrence of cancer, the OTA paper's findings included:   _ELF fields are not known to cause any damage to chromosomes,which contain each cell's genetic material, and hence are not likelyto be initiators of cancer.   _Some cellular-level experiments indicate that the cell membraneis the site of the interaction between ELF fields and the cell. Themembrane site responsible for this action has also been shown to bea receptor for chemical cancer-promoters.   _Epidemiological studies so far have shown a ``weak association''between ELF field exposure and leukemia and nervous system cancer.   The report observed that ``if exposure to fields does turn out topose a health risk, it is unlikely that high-voltage transmissionlines will be the only sources of concern.   ``Power frequency fields are also produced by distribution lines,wall wiring, appliances and lighting fixtures. Thesenon-transmission sources are much more common than transmissionlines and could play a far greater role than transmission lines inany public health problem,'' it said.   Electromagnetic fields are common in nature and appear in allliving things. They hold atoms together, generate lightning and makenavigation by compass possible. Television and radio sets andmicrowave ovens depend on electric and magnetic fields for theiroperation.   Electric fields are produced when electric charges are ``pumped''onto wires by electric generators. Electric fields arise from theamount of the electric charge, and magnetic fields result from themotion of that charge. Taken together, they are referred to aselectromagnetic fields.   Unlike X-rays or microwaves, electromagnetic fields do not causetissue damage or heating. However, low-frequency magnetic fields cantrigger major biochemical responses critical to the functioning ofhuman cells, which operate by complex electrochemical processes.   The OTA paper said that while recent years have seen ``dramaticdevelopments'' in scientific knowledge, ``the past several yearshave also witnessed a marked decrease in the level of federalresearch support in this area which has only recently begun toreverse.''   The Navy, which operates ELF submarine communications facilitiesin Wisconsin and Michigan, undertook about $8 million worth ofbiological effects research between 1969 and 1977. It has continuedto sponsor ecological field studies in the vicinity of thetransmitters, at a level of about $2 million a year.   Over the past decade, the main civilian federal source ofresearch money has been the Department of Energy's Office of EnergyStorage and Distribution, whose research budget rose from $2.2million in fiscal 1988 to $3 million in the current fiscal year.   The states of New York and Maryland have conducted researchprograms, and California recently adopted a bill requiring thestate's larger utilities to fund a two-year, $2 million researchproject on ELF fields.   Research support from the Electric Power Research Institute,sponsored by utility companies, declined slightly in recent yearsbut is now expanding and is projected to reach $6 million in fiscal1990.</TEXT></DOC>
