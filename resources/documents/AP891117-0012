The researchers reported Thursday that a vaccine developed usinggenetic engineering techniques produces contraception for up tonine months in female mice.   The contraceptive vaccine works by preventing fertilization ofeggs by sperm, rather than by interfering with development of thefetus after conception or inducing abortions.   Findings from the research were published in Science, thejournal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.   Asked how long it will be before the work may lead todevelopment of a human contraceptive vaccine, researcher JurrienDean said: ``Well in excess of a decade, but that's justspeculation.''   In the meantime, he said: ``I think that it has potentialapplication probably in veterinary medicine and agriculture. Butour main hope, as basic scientists, is that these studies willstimulate investigations into these types of immunologically basedcontraceptive agents.''   The researchers focused their attention on the zona pellucida, alayer of proteins surrounding egg cells produced by the ovaries inall female mammals. One of the proteins serves as the receptor forthe male sperm cell when fertilization occurs.   Previous studies at NIH and elsewhere had shown that if the zonapellucida is coated with certain antibodies _ proteins that producespecific immune system reactions _ injected into test animals, thensperm cannot fertilize the egg.   In the new research, scientists used genetic engineering methodsto precisely identify the zona pellucida's molecular binding site _a small protein known as a peptide _ for a fertilization-blockingantibody.   A synthetic version of the binding-site peptide then was made inthe laboratory and used to vaccinate female mice. After beingvaccinated with the peptide, the mice produced their own antibodiesserving to prevent fertilization.   This contraceptive effect lasted up to 36 weeks in the mice usedin the NIH experiments.   Dean said it was significant that ``this very precise (genetic)engineering provokes a specific, focused antibody response to justa small part of the zona protein. We believe that this may beimportant in avoiding any side effects such as damage to the ovaryor to other organs.''   Identifying the antibody binding site involved cloning theparticular genes, or segments of genetic material, which controlformation of the zona pellucida protein.   ``It turns out that the zona genes are conserved amongmammals,'' Dean said in an interview. ``That means that verysimilar genes are present in dogs, cats, cows, rats _ any mammalyou pick, including humans. And therefore, if we can work out thestrategy in a model system like mice, we might be able to transferthose observations to other animals.''   The mouse experiments were conducted by a six-member team led bySarah E. Millar of NIH's National Institute of Diabetes andDigestive and Kidney Diseases.
