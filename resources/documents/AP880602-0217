Labor officials representing 1,767 striking janitors say the9-day-old standoff, which has been marked by vandalism and somearrests, may be headed for a city-wide labor-management showdown ifit isn't defused soon.   Effects of the strike and a labor boycott are increasinglyevident in the downtown area to tourists and workers who frequentthe 204 affected buildings, including most major office complexes.   Paper and garbage are scattered all over downtown, trash binsare overflowing and employees in business suits can be seen luggingheavy packages that Teamster drivers refuse to deliver inside.   Pickets are posted around the clock and a few windows have beenbroken and eggs smeared on the fronts of buildings where janitorscontinue to defy the strike.   Labor leaders say they will step up the protests and may furthertighten supply lines if contract negotiations remain deadlocked.Trash haulers, building engineers, construction workers, elevatorrepair personnel, delivery people and longshoremen are all honoringthe strike, although the San Francisco Port remains open.   ``We see this as an important dispute because it is sovisible,'' Chuck Mack, president of Teamsters Joint Council 7, saidThursday. The council represents 30 union locals and 65,000 membersfrom Santa Rosa south to Salinas, encompassing the entire SanFrancisco Bay area.   ``The outcome of this dispute is going to set the tone for othernegotiations in the city and maybe even the Bay area over the nextfew years,'' said Mack.   The 3,500-member Local 87 of the Service Employees InternationalUnion, working without a contract since February, launched thestrike May 24.   The janitors rejected a proposal by the San Francisco BuildingMaintenance Contractors Association for a three-year freeze oftheir $11.25 hourly pay, and changes in job assignments thejanitors say will cost them money.   The janitors want a 50-cent hourly raise in each year of aproposed three-year contract, as well as the continued right to aleave of absence.   The 11 maintenance firms in the association also are seeking atwo-tier pay system in which new hires would get less than currentemployees.   Disgruntled janitors contend they can't keep up with the area'shigh living expenses under the current proposal and claimmanagement's hard bargaining stance may be masking an attempt atunion-busting.   The contractors, in turn, maintain that only New York janitorsmake more than San Francisco's. They say they offer job securityand maintained benefits.   Marc Intermaggio, representing the building owners, said theyremain ``absolutely firm'' in their commitment to ``stem the risein these outrageous wages.''   Contract talks continued Thursday for a third straight day sinceresuming a week after the walkout began, but Local 87secretary-treasurer Eric Hall said there had been ``zero progress''since February.   Guillermo Loyola, a union member for 33 years and a unitforeman, said the disturbance that resulted in five arrests onTuesday is increasingly likely to recur as the stalemate continues.   While some 300 janitors marched through the Financial District,two protesters were arrested after they allegedly struck a policeofficer with picket signs and three were arrested for vandalism anddisturbing the peace.   Local 87 President Wray Jacobs angered police earlier by sayingthat although he does not condone violence, vandalism is ``anemotional outlet'' and he ``might even break one or two (windows)myself at times.''   The San Francisco Labor Council, which is coordinating theboycott, criticized Agnos this week for not taking stronger stepsto end the dispute. After meeting with 14 local labor leaders, thecouncil asked Assembly Speaker Willie Brown to mediate the strike.Brown did not immediately respond.   ``It would seem to me that to maintain harmony in the city, he(Agnos) could have called in people sooner,'' said Walter Johnson,secretary-treasurer of the council. ``I think this needs directaction.''   Deputy Mayor Hadley Roff said the mayor has been talking topeople behind the scenes and urging the two sides to settle theirdifferences at the bargaining table.   Roff said Agnos had no immediate plans to participate directlyin the talks, although he acknowledged having received a fewcomplaints about the downtown disruptions.</TEXT></DOC>
