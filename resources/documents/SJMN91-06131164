We see her complaining about the weather.It's been cold and pouring there, and in most of France, for two weeks. Butthe rain didn't deter either the stars or the gawkers, some of whom waited forhours, protected from the downpour by brightly colored beach umbrellas, forthe show to begin. Lollobrigida, along with Robert Mitchum, Akira Kurosawa,Ben Kingsley and Donald Sutherland, posed in the rain for several shots thenjoined others who entered the Palace Theater, brushed the water from theirgowns and smoking jackets and heard Paul Tchernia and Geraldine Chaplinofficially open the 12-day festival. Certain wags suggest that things willwarm up Sunday. That's when Madonna shows up.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  COLD, WET AND FAMOUS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  People.Compiled from Mercury News wire services.  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Jim Jeffress column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910510  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  142  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday May 10, 199100131164,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
