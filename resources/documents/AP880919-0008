The bear stares back. She scratches her side, then lunges atLand. He fills the shrinking gap with a pink cloud of hot-pepperaerosol, a sort of natural tear gas, and the bear wheels back toher side of the stream.   Again she scratches. Finally she ambles off across the tidalflat.   Land backsteps up the gravel spit he was defending, then turnsto the three people waiting a dozen steps behind him.   ``She didn't mean it,'' he says. ``She wasn't serious.''   Land shrugs off such confrontations as part of his job with theAlaska Department of Fish and Game, enforcing an uneasy trucebetween man and bear at one of the few places where the specieswillingly meet.   Pack Creek flows into a narrow ocean inlet from a steep valleyon Admiralty Island, about 30 miles south of Juneau. The islandboasts the greatest density in the world of Alaska brown bears, alarger version of the grizzly species.   Late each summer, about 30 bears congregate at Pack Creek,splashing through the shallows after spawning salmon and grazing inthe surrounding meadow like a herd of cows.   The interlopers, game officials say, are the increasing numbersof wildlife watchers whose eagerness to capture bears on film iscrowding this corner of wilderness.   Pack Creek is one of only three observatories in Alaska wherepeople can readily watch brown bears. The two others are so popularthe state has a visitor limit at one and a lottery for permits tothe other.   Now Pack Creek is being overwhelmed.   Up to 60 people a day hunker on the gravel spit. Yachtscongregate offshore; bush planes buzz in and out steadily. In 1981,100 people came to Pack Creek. Last year the visits topped 990.   Until this year visitors and bears chased each other around themeadow at Pack Creek, the people in pursuit of photographictrophies, the bears guarding prime spots on the salmon stream.   But gradually, the bears have grown bolder, and less intimidatedby humans. They have chased people off the spit and carried awaypacks and food. Biologists learned from maulings at Yellowstone andother parks which once had garbage dumps that bears become mostdangerous when they associate people with food.   ``We think we have a bomb there and it's ticking,'' says KenMitchell, U.S. Forest Service director for the Admiralty IslandNationl Monument.   Mitchell backs a plan, designed by the Forest Service and stategame officials, to designate the spit as human turf and leave therest of Pack Creek to the bears. The authorities hope the boundarywill keep people from being mauled and bears from being killed.   A few bear-watchers are furious.   ``The bears are all used to people and they're busy fishing.They don't mind you,'' says John Tillinghast, a Juneau attorney whovisited the creek one recent weekend.   Tillinghast said it used to be easy to come away from Pack Creekwith a standard prize: ``Mom and cubs with a 50-millimeter lens ... and you didn't have any babysitter from Fish and Game watchingyou either.''   The bear that lunged at Land _ called ``Pest'' with reason _prompted the new rule. In 1987, a Forest Service letter file grewfat with reports of bold advances by bears along the creek, mostlyPest:   _ Three wildlife watchers reported Pest circled them chompingand growling, then jumped toward them. She was turned away byhot-pepper spray.   _ A San Francisco man told the Forest Service he was chased intothe loft of a woodshed. ``The only reason that I did not shoot wasthat there was a similar problem yesterday'' and the bear did notattack, he wrote.   _ Tourists abandoned a pizza on the spit while fleeing from anapproaching bear. A researcher recorded the bear's reward, down tothe cheese hanging from its snout and paws.   Forest Service staffers at Pack Creek pleaded with Mitchell todo something. ``None of us wants to see Pest killed, but we feelsome action must be taken soon to prevent more incidents,'' theywrote, suggesting the creek be closed to people.   In July 1987, the Forest Service and Alaska Fish and Gameannounced Pest would be killed. When the anticipated roar ofprotest came, they began work on the less drastic plan adopted thisyear.   Enter Stan Price, an irascible 88-year-old who loathesgovernment officials on principal and who has become a rallyingpoint for others opposed to this particular government plan.   Price built his cabin and floated it onto the remote banks ofPack Creek more than 30 years ago. In the decades since, he hasshared the creek with dozens of bears and raised orphan cubs.   ``It burns me up,'' Price says of the new rules, which he feelsallow game officials to harass the animals. ``I can't say what abear's worth. I can't say what a bear's good for. But I know theywere here before we were.''   He reports little conflict with the bears that wander into hiscabins and woodsheds. Price calls them tame and says he was injuredby a bear only once, when he mistook a strange animal for afamiliar one and was swatted on the shoulder as he approached.   Price believes the Forest Service and Fish and Game have trumpedup tales of danger so people will believe they need officialprotection at Pack Creek. Then in the name of safety the agenciescan charge admission and turn the creek into a money-makingYellowstone, he says.   Price knows the bears by name and lineage and becomes distraughtat thoughts they might be shot or relocated.   State and federal officials have said that if the boundarysystem doesn't work they will relocate Pest and, if she returns toPack Creek and causes trouble, she'll be killed.   The Forest Service hopes to exercise some crowd control, too, bylimiting commercial tours, which now account for more than half thevisitors. Officials are considering a fee to cover the governmentcost of monitoring Pack Creek, estimated at more than $20,000 ayear. They say there's no intent, as Price suggested, of making aprofit.   Someday, Mitchell predicts, there'll be need for an observatorywhere hundreds of people can go to watch the bears' annual fishingbinge.   But it won't be at Pack Creek.   ``If there are such viewing areas,'' Mitchell says, ``theyprobably shouldn't be in wilderness.''</TEXT></DOC>
