The foamedemulsion comprising an organic solvent for paraffins, the solvent beingselected from the group consisting of halogenated hydrocarbons of lowvolatility and highly aromatic hydrocarbons, and a non-acidic aqueousliquid containing not less than 2,000 ppm by weight of dissolved ioniccomponents selected from the group consisting of sodium chloride andpotassium chloride, and sufficient of a surface active agent selectedto maintain the stability of the foamed emulsion under conditions ofagitation while allowing the foamed emulsion to degas and separate intotwo substantially continuous liquid phases under relatively quiescentconditions.</TEXT></DOC>
