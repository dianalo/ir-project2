The test was carried out Thursday on Jones Intercable facilitiesin Anne Arundel County, Md., northeast of Washington and on MediaGeneral Cable equipment in Fairfax County, Va., last week.   The demonstration was designed to show that regular coaxialcable can carry an HDTV picture to a TV receiver with existingtechnology and without significant loss of quality.   Officials of the National Cable Television Association declaredthe test a success and said it shows that it is not necessary tohave expensive fiber-optic cable systems to provide advancedtelevision service.   Telephone companies, currently barred from providing cableprogramming or cable service in their telephone areas, are seen ashaving a potential major role in the market and are advocating useof glass fiber cables that transmit voice, video and data signalson laser beams.   Brenda Fox, NCTA vice president and general counsel, toldreporters at Thursday's demonstration that it shows coaxial, orbundled wire, cables can ``retransmit the quality of picture andsound that everyone talks about in high-definition television.''   She said the 40-channel Jones Intercable is a typical cablesystem and the successful test shows ``we can transmit an HDTVsignal on classic systems around the country.''   Proponents of high-definition television say it can providepictures with the quality of 35mm film and sound equivalent tocompact disc recordings.   Thursday's demonstration did, indeed, show very high-qualityimages of ice skaters, the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, movie clipsand boxer Mike Tyson on three separate receivers: a 50-inchprojection TV; a 32-inch cathode ray tube set; and a smaller CRT inwhich the HDTV signal was converted to the so-called NTSC signalthat standard sets display.   The demonstration utilized a Japanese MUSE-E HDTV signal thatwas sent from Home Box Office facilities in Long Island, N.Y., tothe SATCOM K1 satellite and relayed to a Jones Intercable receivingdish on the ground.   From there the signal was sent through 28 miles of coaxialcable, including 26 amplifiers, and then displayed on the three TVsets, NCTA said.   Cable executives said it was the first ``end-to-end'' HDTV testin which all elements of a delivery system, from programorigination point to the TV set, were used.   Paul Heimbach, HBO's vice president of engineering, said thetest provided a ``very acceptable'' signal at the end.   HBO may be one of the first companies in this country to provideHDTV programs, particularly if the Japanese, as expected, begin tointroduce HDTV receivers, VCRs and video discs into this country.   The Japanese already are far ahead of U.S. companies indeveloping HDTV and made a small-scale test of asatellite-delivered system earlier this month.   Heimbach said that since most of HBO's programs already are 35mmfilms, it would be a natural progression for HBO to enter the HDTVarena once the demand is there.   HDTV won't be cheap. TV sets are expected to be in the$3,000-$4,000 range initially. And it is possible that programmingwill cost more than at present.   But Heimbach said preliminary results of a recent survey ofconsumers in Kansas City, Mo., showed about a third of those whoviewed an HDTV test said they'd willing to pay more to receive HDTV.   NCTA will continue to test HDTV systems as they becomeavailable. A number of American, Japanese and European systems havebeen proposed, but so far only Japan has developed equipmentcapable of testing.   The Federal Communications Commission ruled last year that anyU.S. HDTV system cannot make existing NTSC TV sets obsolete. TheMUSE-E system is not compatible with current sets.   Fox said cable executives want to try to reach agreement withover-the-air broadcasters on a common HDTV standard.   ``We're not trying to beat the other guy,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
