The U.S. District Court issued a temporary restraining order, preventing enforcement for 10 days of an Oklahoma anti-takeover law that requires shareholder approval before acquired shares can be voted. Thus, Mr. Edelman, a New York investor, will be able to vote shares tendered to him in his $65-a-share offer that expires Friday.    When he made the offer earlier this month, Mr. Edelman said it was contingent upon successfully challenging certain provisions of Oklahoma securities law regulating takeovers. Analysts saw the order as making Mr. Edelman's takeover of the Tulsa-based company far more likely, if he has the financing. Mr. Edelman, reached yesterday, said, &quot;We're well along the way with the financing. I've been confident all along we can go through with it.&quot;    &quot;Since the offer ends Friday, the 10-day injunction gives him the window to take tendered stock and assume voting control,&quot; said Jim Poyner, an analyst with Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc. in Dallas. &quot;It's an attractive offer and I think most holders will tender.    &quot;Under the Oklahoma Control Share Acquisition Act, when a bidder gains control of 20% or more of a company's stock, a vote of the other shareholders is called to determine if voting rights will be given to stock held by the bidder. Thus, under the law, even if Mr. Edelman was tendered more than 50% of Telex's stock, he might not have been able to assume voting control.    Telex didn't have any comment on the restraining order. The company's shares closed yesterday at $57.125, up $1.25, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    Mr. Edelman said that about 400,000 shares, or about 2.5% of those outstanding, have been tendered so far. He noted, however, that &quot;brokerages and arbitragers rarely tender until the last day of the offer,&quot; in the hope that the bid will be sweetened. TLX Acquisition Corp., the company Mr. Edelman set up to make the bid, already holds about 7.7% of Telex on a fully diluted basis.    The market has been rife with rumors about Telex bringing in a friendly suitor to acquire the company, but Mr. Poyner, the analyst, discounted them. &quot;The fact that Telex hasn't come back with a white knight by now suggests that they can't do it,&quot; he said. &quot;Given what's happened to the stock price, it's awfully hard to convince anyone to challenge a $65 offer.&quot;    The only defense Telex is publicly pursuing is a lawsuit filed against Mr. Edelman in state court in Tulsa, alleging violations of securities law and asking for a halt to the tender offer. The court said yesterday it expects to announce a decision in the suit tomorrow.    Mr. Edelman made his offer early this month, before the stock market crashed, when the shares were trading around $60. The stock climbed above $70 on speculation that Mr. Edelman would increase his offer, but Telex's shares plunged as low as $34.25 after the market crashed.    Analysts said uncertainty created by the market crash also raises questions about Mr. Edelman's ability to come up with the financing for the purchase. But Mr. Edelman said two weeks ago that Paris-based Banque Paribas might arrange as much as $570 million of the financing. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. has said it would arrange a $600 million short-term bridge loan for the transaction. </TEXT></DOC>
