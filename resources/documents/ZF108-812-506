 Resume-writing software is not necessary, but jobseekers should be willing to alter ineffective resumes.andP;  Employersprefer short resumes that list only qualifications for particularjobs, so job seekers should maintain several specialized resumesthat focus on different aspects of previous experience.andO;Applicants must determine the kinds of qualifications the employeris looking for, and the most appropriate background should belisted first on the resume.andP;  Include company training courses andawards because they give a good impression of an applicant'sdesire to work and be involved.andP;  Information can be lost whenresumes are converted to company format, so resumes should beclear and job-seekers should check to see that errors arecorrected.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     ResumesJob SearchGuidelines.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Todd admired his carefully prepared resume.andP;  After week of trial and error,he had finally produced the masterpiece that would surely attract dozens,perhaps hundreds, of lucrative job offers.andP;  He had packed every key aspect ofhis working life (and more) onto four bonded sheets (10-point type).andP;  Thisresume had to be the greatest one ever.andM;Three weeks and $100 in printing and postage costs later, Todd discovered tohis dismay that few companies were responding.andP;  In fact, the responses thatdid arrive were irritating form letters-&quot;we have filed your submission in ourrecords, good luck,&quot; or &quot;thanks, but no thanks.&quot; His friends had raved aboutthe resume.andP;  What had gone wrong?andM;As an Al consultant, I frequently meet computer-focused workers like Todd whohave been disappointed by the response to their resumes.andP;  Unfortunately, hard work and long lists don't necessarily translate into a good resume.andO;I've worked in the personnel office of a large computer-service bureau, beena manager who hires computer specialists, and written and rewritten resumesfor colleagues seeking my assistance for their ordeal.andP;  I'd like to help AIEXPERT readers by sharing some tips on resume preparation.andM;ELIOT'S NINE POINTSandM;First, you need to detach yourself from your resume.andP;  Many resume ,owners&quot;become offended at the change of a word or even indentation.andP;  Remember, inthe computer programming realm, each programmer agrees to overcome thetendency to defend their code during walk-throughs and focus on the codeitself.andP;  Similarly, you must Consider your resume a piece of written paperthat is also a promotional vehicle; useful changes shouldn't bruise any egos.andM;Second, don't become preoccupied by describing everything you've ever done.andO;Todd's four pager is likely to end up in a huge pile of &quot;look at later&quot;resumes (or worse, in the trash can).andP;  Most resume readers are busy; whetherit's someone in personnel or a hiring manager, reading four pages from eachof 100 people would take a lot of time.andP;  In most cases, a resume should beone page long (possibly two pages) and accompanied by a brief,professional-looking letter.andM;I often see resumes that mention every LISP and PROLOG interpreter thecandidate has ever touched or long lists of Al-related subroutines developedover five years.andP;  My advice is to stay away from the details.andP;  You want tohook readers by teasing them with your background; you can always providemore detail after the hook has been swallowed.andP;  Ironically, providing the&quot;whole truth and nothing but&quot; can lead to more problems than excessive size.andO;For example, suppose you worked on a defunct LISP machine and the readerassociates you with the machine's failure.andP;  You will get branded even thoughyou had nothing to do with it.andM;When I slim down a resume the owner will usually complain that their manyyears of work deserve some recognition; furthermore, they'll insist thatdeleting all references to their work is dishonest.andP;  Keep in mind that yourresume isn't a certificate that will hang on a wall-it's a tool that shouldbe tailored to its intended use.andP;  If you're applying for an Al  ob, emphasizeyour Al work.andP;  If you're applying for a COBOL-programmer job and you suspectan Al background isn't relevant (or may even create a negative bias), tailorthe resume to your audience and omit (or recast) Al details.andP;  Third, as Imentioned before, indicating your work experience selectively to &quot;customize&quot;your resume is fine.andP;  I recommend that you prepare several, rather thanhaving only one trying to be all things to all people.andP;  You might have oneresume that emphasizes your project-management experience for jobs thatrequire supervisory duties, another that touts your broadknowledge-engineering skills for systems-analyst roles, and a thirdemphasizing your programming skills in KEE, ART, C, and other coding tools.andM;Don't misunderstand me-I'm not advocating dishonest resumes.andP;  Don't overstatewhat you  I up the time spent, or write a fictional story about yourescapades.andP;  Many firms verify resumes and the word that yours is questionablecould spread rapidly.andP;  State the facts in a professional manner and includeinformation relevant to the position.andM;For example, suppose you and three other knowledge engineers were laid off byan Al vendor.andP;  You could be truthful and admit you were fired; unfortunately,the implication of such a confession reflects poorly on you (you must be arotten worker or were difficult to work with).andP;  But suppose you were dumpedbecause of a downturn in the industry and you obviously weren't alone in thepurge.andP;  The resume could indicate that the vendor suffered a &quot;downsizing&quot;(the polite term), that your Westcoast group was another &quot;Al winter&quot;casualty.andM;Fourth, many computer specialists are embarrassed by company awards orsnicker at corporate training courses, so they often don't include them onresumes.andP;  Place yourself in the hiring firm's shoes.andP;  How does yourbackground reflect your eagerness to work, advance, and get involved in youremployer's activities? If the expert system application you slaved over wonan internal award for improving quality on the production line, state it.andM;You should also include an of your advanced training; perhaps you took acompany course on CICS or attended a local seminar on the latest version ofLevel5.andP;  Include conferences in which you participated or attended tutorials(AAAI tutorial on nonmonotonic reasoning, IJCNN tutorial on neural networksin business, and so on).andP;  Many resume writers suddenly realize that theydidn't do very much while they worked all those years on their jobs.andP;  Youshould be trying to accomplish these advances all along and you might want tostart right now (even if you don't foresee an imminent job search).andM;Fifth, you probably don't need to buy a special software package just towrite your resume.andP;  Several packages are available that have zillions ofsample resumes (usually' for less than $100) and threaten that without theirpackage you're doomed to failure.andP;  I agree that examining other resumes is agood idea, and you should properly word process it.andP;  Please, don't use asimple dot-matrix printer or 1,000 typefaces and weird boldings).andP;  You canusually obtain resumes from friends and write one on your home computer, orgo down to your local print shop for assistance.andM;Sixth, know your audience.andP;  If you see an Al ad in the classifieds, try todetermine the employer's &quot;hot buttons.&quot; Do they stress advanced degrees? Ifso, emphasize your graduate work; even if you didn't complete an MS, you cstill mention the courses in learning systems or intelligent interfaces.andP;  Dothey want technical creativity? Bring up the clever way you got aroundbackward-chaining problems in an early version of VP-Expert.andP;  Entrepreneurialthinking needed? Talk about the new natural-language processing interface youconvinced the firm to use as a front-end to DB2.andM;Seventh, tread lightly when the salary issue arises.andP;  Handling salaryrequirements is always a delicate matter.andP;  On the one hand, if you indicatewhat you need for a salary and it's higher than the hiring firm expects, youprobably won't get past first base.andP;  A firm frequently will have a fixedsalary in mind, but if a company is sold on your capabilities then salary isnegotiable.andM;Some ads state that resumes must be accompanied with a salaryhistory-sometimes they mean it, sometimes they don't.andP;  If you state a salarymuch lower than expected, you'll either get knocked out because the firmfigures you weren't really doing comparable work, or it'll try to pay yourock bottom dollar in the new job.andP;  In making your salary-interest decision,you might want to consult salary surveys to determine how much a job in acertain industry and geographic area is likely to be compensated.andP;  (Salarysurveys can be found in libraries; alternatively, you can contactprofessional societies such as the Society for Information Management).andO;Eighth, physically place items on your resume in the order that best supportsyour background.andP;  Many resume writers are concerned about whether education,job history, or hardware and software experience should come first.andO;Generally, you should begin with whatever you believe is your greateststrength and fits the  ob's requirements.andP;  If a company wants an experiencedknowledge engineer, blast them right away with your on-the-jobknowledge-engineering skills; if it wants a Symbolics programmer, hit it withyour favorite Symbolics tricks.andP;  Your resume's opening creates an importantfirst impression-so make it the right one.andP;  Ninth, you may find aftercrafting your resume that the whole thing will be condensed and translated bysomeone else and will no longer reflect your background.andP;  Companies willoften convert paper-based resumes into electronic forms (if the clerk can'tunderstand what TSO, OS/2, and other items mean you can bet that some bizarreitems will be entered into their computer), and headhunters will oftentranslate your resume into their own standard resume format.andP;  (Once again,the hectic headhunter may miss important points or otherwise misunderstandyour resume.)andM;Unfortunately, preventing the destruction of your prized resume is difficult.andO;If you get a call from a firm asking you how long you've programmed inFORTRANPROLOG&quot; (headhunter assumed that PROLOG was a version of FORTRAN), orwhether ADS is a newer version of ADABAS, find out how the firm got theinformation and correct it.andM;Two important notes: you can ignore most of these rules if an employerindicates they want their resume submissions written in a preferred manner.andO;In some cases, employers will severely constrain the items that can be listedand indicate the order, phrasing, and so on.andP;  Obviously, aim for what theyrequest (though you can always try to add a little flair here and there).andP;  - andO;In addition, no matter how good and cleverly packaged your resume is,remember that very few jobs are captured by replying to a blind ad.andP;  Mostjobs are obtained by a pull (having someone inside supporting you), not apush trying to get into the company yourself).andP;  Your resume is a calling cardthat conveniently allows someone to judge whether you might be a candidate.andO;You need some means to get it to the right person in the right way, and youmust follow-up with the dreaded interview.andM;A STIFF UPPER LIPandM;A cartoon above my workstation is a handy reminder about the improper (orproper) writing of resumes.andP;  Two people are in a room, one seated behind adesk reading a resume and the other in front of the desk, anxiously awaitinga response.andP;  The reader looks the other in the eye and says: &quot;Your resume iswonderfully told, witty, engaging, and complete-unfortunately, we don'tpublish resumes.&quot; Remember, you don't have to write the greatest story evertold.andP;  just get the right points across, and the job.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
