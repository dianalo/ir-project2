The problem has eased lately at CMS Energy Corp., Jackson,Mich., amid &quot;downsizing.&quot; In the weak economy, employeeswon't risk their jobs by taking time off, and companies aretougher on absenteeism, ITT says. The Bureau of NationalAffairs says the median rate of absence was 1.8% in the firsthalf of 1991, down from 1.9% a year ago, the first changesince 1986.</LP><TEXT>   Roy F. Weston Inc., a West Chester, Pa., environmentalconsultant, says busy workers in group units press peers notto slack off. Family-leave policies, employee assistanceprograms, flexible hours, rewards for good attendance andemployee participation in corporate decisions also help, sayWeston, Viacom International, TempForce and a Simon andamp;Schuster software unit.   Awrey Bakeries of Livonia, Mich., sees a declining workethic, however; it says some workers &quot;look for any excuse notto show up.&quot;                                                                                                          A HEALTH-POLICY SPLIT plagues labor unions even more.   AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland testified for Rep.Rostenkowski's bill to require employers to offer workershealth coverage or pay into a health-care fund. But at thesame hearing, his support is offset when top officials of theUnited Auto Workers, AFSCME, the Communications Workers ofAmerica and others say they back a Canadian-style nationalhealth-insurance plan.   The UAW's Owen Bieber tells an AFLCIO health committeemeeting that he would lose his job if he supported anincome-tax surcharge such as the Rostenkowski bill proposes.Seeing the union split, some senators want to know wherelabor stands. Mr. Kirkland upbraids the dissenters for&quot;leaks&quot; to the media about the split.                                                                                                          MOUNTING CUTS IN FACULTIES and staffs mar campus serenity.   College staffs, long immune to layoffs, face cutbacks amidlagging revenues; layoff talk helped AFSCME organize 2,300clerical workers at the University of Illinois, organizingdirector Paul Booth says. The University of California atBerkeley mulls cuts of 275 faculty and staff jobs; it gave167 faculty members the golden handshake last year.   &quot;The long-term outlook is for fewer people working here,&quot;a UCLA official says. This year's budget will trim sevenfaculty positions at the University of New Hampshire, andsimilar cuts through attrition and retirements are plannedfor 1992-93. New Hampshire state colleges restrain hiring.   New Hampshire, Boston College and UCLA more likely willfill jobs with part-time or temporary employees.                                                                                                          GRADUATE-STUDENT teaching assistants can form a union, theNew York Public Employment Relations Board rules in a casebrought by the Communications Workers on behalf of 4,000grad-student employees of the State University of New York.Similar cases are pending across the U.S., the union says.                                                                                                          CAPTIVITY INSURANCE is offered members of the Ohio CivilService Employees Association who work in prisons. It citeswhat it calls the nation's highest inmate-to-officer ratio.An officer taken hostage could be paid a sum equalling halfhis or her annual salary, or more if death or disabilityresults.                                                                                                          CALLING UNCLE SAM: Fully 43% of 500 senior executivespolled by benefits consultant Noble Lowndes favortax-financed health benefits for all; 24% favor them for thejobless and 28% back mandatory employer-provided healthcoverage. But 34% oppose any national health-care policy.                                                                                                          CALLING HIM AGAIN: In the Noble Lowndes survey, 82% of theexecutives support government policies to enhance retirees'income; most favor restoring full tax deductions forcontributions to individual retirement accounts, and 40%support improved Social Security benefits. However, 90% backpenalty-free early IRA withdrawals; Noble Lowndes warns thatthis could jeopardize retirement nest eggs.                                                                                                          WORK-FORCE DIVERSITY: The recession doesn't damp employerconcerns.   Corporate support for programs aimed at managingincreasingly diverse groups of employees has risen sharply inthe past two years, a poll of 227 senior personnel executivesby consultant Towers Perrin shows. Fully 55% said that&quot;Workforce 2000&quot; programs to help managers better utilizewomen and minorities and address skill deficiencies andchanging worker values have more top-level support than in1989.   Officials who said support hasn't grown usually citedpreoccupation with other business matters and the recession.But the slump has caused only &quot;moderate cutbacks&quot; inchild-care initiatives and other efforts to help womenworkers, or in programs to deal with cultural diversity, saidMargaret Regan, a Towers Perrin expert.   Apparently reflecting the recession, only 32% of thosesurveyed said a labor shortage influences decisions, comparedwith 35% two years ago.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: About 80% of 128 vending-machine ownerspolled by Plantation Baking Co. snack every day on the foodtheir workers put in the machines. . . . The State Universityof New York at Buffalo creates a construction safety andhealth institute, like ones in Canada, Germany, Sweden andthe U.K. . . . Only a third of 179 large companies, and 25%of service firms, surveyed by recruiter Paul Ray andamp; CarreOrban have a full-time service quality improvement executive.</TEXT></DOC>
