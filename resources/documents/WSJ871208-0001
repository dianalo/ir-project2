Mr. Birdsall is the 66-year-old general manager of Osage Municipal Utilities Inc. and the town's chief apostle of energy conservation. &quot;Wes has put thousands of dollars in our pockets, and we in turn have put that money into the community,&quot; says Jim Hayden, a local Ford dealer.    That investment is evident throughout Osage. While the town has only 4,000 residents, it is home to five manufacturing plants, three automobile dealerships, a 44-bed hospital, 10 clothing stores, and steadily growing bank deposits.    All told, Mr. Birdsall's efforts have helped cut power usage an average of 10% per home since 1980. Savings, though, have gone beyond that. By damping demand for electricity, city-owned Osage Municipal hasn't had to invest in expensive new plant construction or pay a hefty premium to guarantee bulk-power purchases from another utility. As bonds used to finance Osage Municipal's existing generator have matured and system improvements have reduced operating inefficiencies, the utility in the past five years has been able to cut rates five times, totaling 19%. Meanwhile, the use of electric appliances in Osage has actually grown. For example, 560 of the town's 1,600 homes have air conditioners today, up from only 375 in 1980.    Mr. Birdsall's efficiency program began in 1974 as he knocked on doors and preached the gospel of home insulation. Then in 1980, he accepted a state offer to search for poorly insulated buildings in Osage by taking infrared aerial photographs of every structure in town. The photos in hand, Mr. Birdsall circled all the dark spots -- indications of heat loss -- and passed the photos around.    &quot;The scan showed that our roof really needed work,&quot; says Lowell Olsen, a trustee of the local hospital. He credits a recently installed new roof for saving the hospital $20,000 a year -- more than 20% of its previous heating bill.    Mr. Birdsall followed up with a ground-level infrared picture of every house in town. He also now gives away energy-saving devices such as fluorescent light bulbs and insulating jackets for hot-water heaters. He even bought a huge tree-planting machine to help residents plant trees around their houses. The reasoning: the more shade, the less need for air conditioning.    &quot;This is one of our longer-term projects, I grant you,&quot; he says.    But some store owners on Main Street grumble that Mr. Birdsall meddles in their affairs, that maybe Osage Municipal has gotten overzealous in its social program. The utility, for example, now won't hook up new customers unless they meet its minimum insulation requirements. When one homeowner learned of this policy, he fired off an angry letter to Mr. Birdsall about the tyranny of fascism and threatened to sue, though he didn't.    Others, however, sing the utility's praises. Fox River Mills Inc., a specialty sock maker in town, has raised output 30% over the past four years while spending not even 1% more for electricity. John Lessard, its president, says Mr. Birdsall and his staff have helped scrutinize his factory, looking for ways to cut Fox River's energy consumption.    All the hoopla over energy savings in Osage has some residents initiating their own programs. Carpenters in Osage, in fact, are booked through to February with insulating projects. And church groups now hold all their meetings on Wednesday night, instead of throughout the week, to keep from having to repeatedly fire up boilers.    At the local Super Valu supermarket, Everett Steele, the owner, built a wall around some basement compressors to capture waste heat. Then he put in a vent and two fans to suck the hot air out onto the main floor, where it heats the building. Mr. Steele figures the savings on his heating bill translate into lower food prices by about 5% -- enough, he says, to keep people shopping locally rather than driving to big discount supermarkets in nearby Mason City.    Mr. Birdsall is already planning new energy-saving projects for Osage Municipal. With grant money from the Northeast Midwest Institute, a Washington, D.C., research organization, he plans to try to entice companies to turn in their old motors for new, high-efficiency ones. Among his other goals: a dome for the town swimming pool, rebates for efficient appliances and, of course, another cut in rates. </TEXT></DOC>
