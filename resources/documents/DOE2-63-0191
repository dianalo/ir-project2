Bountis for the periodic orbits of a dynamicalmapping is applied to the horizontal motion of a particle in a storagering with sextupole magnets. The approach developed takes into accountany number of non-linear ``kicks'' in one superperiod of the ring, non-equalspacing between nonlinear elements and a strong focusing magnet system.The stability criterion for a fixed point is given provided such a fixedpoint is found. The formula for the tune of the small oscillations forany stable fixed point is derived. 2 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
