While the conviction of hotel billionairess Leona Helmsley on taxcheating charges doesn't directly affect the predicament plaguingjunk-bond king Michael Milken, it was not a good week for peoplecharged with white-collar crimes.   In addition to Leona, TV evangelist Jim Bakker collapsed in anapparent breakdown during his fraud and conspiracy trial this pastweek; stock speculator Salim B. Lewis pleaded guilty to securitiesfraud charges; and a Chicago lawyer was sentenced to thelongest-ever prison term for insider trading.   All of those events sent ominous signals about what Milken risksif his case goes to trial. Milken, former head of Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc.'s high-yield bond unit, has pleaded innocent to 98counts of securities fraud and racketeering.   Like Milken, all four defendants in these other cases wereextremely wealthy _ Helmsley is one of the world's richest women.All were accused of crimes that reflected arrogance, greed andunbridled excess.   Perhaps more important, the judicial process in the cases ofHelmsley and the attorney Alfred Elliott showed that judges andjuries are quite willing to punish white-collar felons as harshly assuspects convicted for violent crimes.   That fact may have played a role in the decision by Lewis tostrike a deal with federal prosecutors in New York and plead guiltyto three felonies for stock manipulation. Lewis originally hadasserted innocence and his lawyers had called his indictment ``apiece of garbage.''   Although jurors in the highly publicized Helmsley trial aquittedher of the most serious charges, they were swayed by evidence thatshe flaunted the tax laws to cheat the government of $1.2 million byusing falsified bills.   In a case laced with the poetic-justice atmosphere of the FrenchRevolution's backlash against the rich, Mrs. Helmsley faces theprospect of a prison stint, her designer clothes doffed for aninmate jumpsuit, her luxurious staterooms sacrificed for a skinnybunk mattress.   To Milken and other prospective defendants in securities-fraudcases, the punishment given to Elliott may have been even moreunsettling. The Chicago lawyer, who represented firms involved intakeovers, was sentenced to five years in prison for trading stockson secret corporate information to make more than $600,000 inillicit profits.   That term is a record for insider trading and is two years longerthan the term given Ivan F. Boesky, considered the most notoriousinside trader in Wall Street history, who paid the government $100million to settle his case and whose subsequent cooperation led tothe Milken indictment.   Milken's trial isn't expected to start until next year, and thepossibility exists that he could strike a plea bargain. But therewas one intriguing disclosure this past week that suggested he mightfight to the end.   The Washington Post quoted a secret Securities and ExchangeCommission memo as saying Boesky and Milken conferred in July 1986about how to conceal a $5.3 million payment, the heart of thegovernment's case against Milken.   The SEC memo raised the possibility that Boesky may have beencooperating with the government at the time of the allegedrendezvous with Milken and may have been ordered to entrap him. Ifso, Milken's lawyers may have a powerful new tool to discredit thegovernment's case.   In other business and economic news this past week:   _Government reports on the economy were generally favorable, butone private report was less optimistic. The Labor Department saidunemployment steadied in August at 5.2 percent and revised the Juneand July job-growth figures upward. At the same time, the NationalAssociation of Purchasing Management said its index of economicstatistics suggested a serious slowdown in August.   _Japan's pre-eminence in the world banking industry and itsrapidly growing image as a stock-fraud playground were reinforced bythe merger of Mitsui Bank Ltd. and Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd., which wouldcreate the second-largest banking company behind Dai-Ichi KangyoBank Ltd. Immediately after the merger was disclosed, Japanesesecurities regulators said they were checking suspicous trades ofstock in the two banks prior to the announcement.   _Takeover rumors and counter-rumors roiled the airline industry,centering on new or revised bids for United, American andContinental that could include foreign-airline partners.   _The merger andamp; acquisitions business also extended into thechildren's entertainment industry, where Walt Disney Co. acquiredHenson Associates Inc., owner of the Muppet characters. The dealadds Kermit and Miss Piggy to the Mickey Mouse club.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for weekend editions Sept. 2-3</NOTE></DOC>
