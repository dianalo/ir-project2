Lou F. Harrington, senior vice president of the St. Louis aerospace concern's Douglas Aircraft Co. unit, said at a Financial Times conference here that &quot;little material progress&quot; has been made in the past year or so of talks between the company and the European consortium. The discussions were aimed at teaming on one or more models to chip away at Seattle-based Boeing Co.'s dominance in the long-range aircraft market.    But now, Mr. Harrington said, all three airplane builders have their plans in place for the next decade. The only possibility for collaboration, based on product planes, would be between McDonnell Douglas and Airbus on an airplane of fewer than 150 seats or on a large, twin-aisle aircraft, he said.    The two companies haven't been able to agree on plans in either of these product categories because they are in competition in other segments. McDonnell Douglas has been unwilling to drop its MD-11 long-haul tri-jet and Airbus recently said it plans to go ahead with its competing A-330 and A-340 airplanes.    Airbus is a consortium grouping Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.)H of West Germany, Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain. </TEXT></DOC>
