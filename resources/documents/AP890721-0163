Manuel Antonio Noriega'soffice.   U.S. officials said they were testing plans for evacuatingmilitary units and Americans living in Panama. About 600 soldierswere involved in the five-hour exercise at Fort Amador and FortClayton, near Panama City at the southern entrance to the PanamaCanal.   Noriega's government was not informed of the exercisebeforehand, and it was not known if he was in the office at thetime.   The U.S. Southern Command said in a statement that the exercise,called Purple Storm, was intended to demonstrate its ``commitmentto protect U.S. lives'' and ``resolve in enforcing U.S. Forcestreaty rights.''   Under the 1977 treaties, the Panama Canal will be given toPanama at the end of 1999, but U.S. forces will be in charge of thecanal's defense.   The United States has troop movement rights, and U.S. officialshave said they would exercise them to pressure Noriega, Panama's defacto leader, to step down as head of the nation's Defense Forces.   On Thursday, the Organization of American States approved aresolution calling for a transfer of power on Sept. 1 to restoredemocracy and subsequent elections.   The opposition, which appeared to have won the May 7presidential election, criticized the resolution, saying iteffectively endorsed the government's annulment of the balloting.   One of the drills at Fort Amador was carried out aroundNoriega's office with U.S. helicopters hovering overhead. Armoredvehicles parked around the building, and U.S. troops in combat gearwere deployed.   Fort Amador includes Panamanian military installations, a U.S.naval station and a staff building. The naval station is across aparking lot from Noriega's office; the staff building is across thestreet.   Detachments from seven army battalions and brigades took part,including nearly 100 armored personnel carriers, mechanized landingcraft, and CH-47 and Cobra gunship helicopters. Two Navy patrolboats and two Air Force jet aircraft provided additional security.   Panamanians went about their business during the exercise. APanamanian military policeman tried to continue directing traffic,even though he was hampered by two personnel carriers.   Relations between the United States and Panama have been tensesince a federal grand jury in Florida indicted Noriega on drugtrafficking in Feburary 1988.   The United States since has frozen millions of dollars worth ofPanamanian assets in U.S. banks and embargoed payments from PanamaCanal tolls. The measures have plunged the nation into an economiccrisis but have failed to budge Noriega.   Noriega claims the attempts to oust him are part of an attemptto violate the canal treaties so the United States can retaincontrol of the waterway.</TEXT></DOC>
