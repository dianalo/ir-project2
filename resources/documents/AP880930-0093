ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>IDALOU, Texas (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Michael Dukakis, campaigning inrural Texas, promised today to devote $100 million for investmentin farm areas and said that his Republican presidential rival ispursuing an agricultural policy of ``the fewer farmers the better.''   At a rally on a farm in west Texas, Dukakis said that ruralAmerica is filled with ``monuments to the neglect and indifferenceand incompetence of Mr. (George) Bush and his friends.   ``Farms and ranches abandoned or foreclosed, banks and hospitalsshut down, storefronts boarded up. Communities fighting tosurvive.''   The Democratic presidential nominee's emphasis on ruraldevelopment came a day after he and Bush traded charges over SocialSecurity, specifically whether they had both once supportedproposals for a one-year freeze in benefit cost-of-livingadjustments.   Bush cast a tie-breaking Senate vote in favor of such a freezein 1985. Dukakis supported a National Governors Associationresolution that included such a freeze earlier in the same year.   The Massachusetts governor told a news conference in DallasThursday that he voted for the NGA resolution only after firstfighting to delete the benefits freeze from it.   At the farm rally, Dukakis said, ``The Republicans put Americaon the auction block. They've been selling off our farms andbusinesses and banks and real estate to the Japanese and the Saudisand the Germans and others.''   Recalling Bush's call for a ``kinder and gentler America'' inhis acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention,Dukakis asked if the vice president's idea of a kinder and gentlerAmerica was ``foreclosing on American farmers, letting our smalltowns die?''   ``Mr. Bush's farm policy can be summed up in five words: thefewer farmers the better. And the Republican rural developmentpolicy can be summed up in two words: tough luck.''   Dukakis said that as president he would push for improved ruralhealth care and schools and would designate $100 million of hisproposed Fund to Rebuild America for investment in rural areas ``tohelp small businesses get the financing the need to create new jobsand to save old ones, and to bring the industries of the future tothe rural towns and counties of this country.''   At a news conference in Michigan Thursday, Bush struck back onthe Social Security issue.   ``I was a little surprised to see this demogoguery from the manwho had exactly the same position that the president had on thatone-year slipping of the COLAs,'' the GOP nominee said.   Throughout the Reagan years, Social Security has consistentlyworked as an issue for Democrats running against Republicans.   Dukakis has relished using it against Bush.   In speeches he cites Bush's plan for a capital gains tax cut,the vice president's support for increases in defense spending andthen says if Bush is going to reduce the deficit ``how's he goingto do it without raiding the Social Security trust fund.''   The Democratic nominee also quotes Bush as calling SocialSecurity ``basically a welfare program,'' a quote that invariablydraws boos from partisan audiences.   At his news conference, Bush said, ``I want to keep that SocialSecurity trust fund sound and I will do that and I will not permitit to be raided for social spending programs.''   For several years, the nation's governors debated proposalsurging President Reagan and Congress to act on the budget deficitthrough a combination of cuts in defense spending and tax increases.   Reagan consistently rejected their appeals although in 1985 herelented and temporarily endorsed the freeze passed by the Senatewith bipartisan support.   Reagan later backed away from his support for including SocialSecurity benefits in the freeze and the whole plan died.   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidentialnominee, voted in May 1984 to support a one-year delay in SocialSecurity COLAs and in May 1985, he supported a six-month delay.   Mike McCurry, Bentsen's campaign spokesman, said that in May1985 the Texas senator supported the Democratic alternative to an``underlying Republican effort to cut the COLA.''   The Republican are trying to ``distort the record,'' he said.``They can run but they can't hide.''</TEXT></DOC>
