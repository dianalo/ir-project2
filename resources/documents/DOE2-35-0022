An inverse correlation has,for instance been found between the amount of artificially induced {alpha}-damageand the TL sensitivity. As the degree of damage in natural samples ofsphene was varied by means of annealing for 1 h at various temperatures,it was found that there were two phases which characterized the patternof the TL sensitivity. A comparison was made of the effect of annealingon the TL sensitivity of natural samples and that of aliquots from thesame samples which had been completely annealed and then irradiated with(i) {similar_to} 30 MeV {alpha}-particles at a fluence of up to 10/sup16/ {alpha} cm/sup -2/ from a cyclotron, and (ii) reactor thermal neutronsto induce fission in the U-contents of the crystals. The TL sensitivityof artificially damaged samples exhibited patterns broadly similar tothose of natural samples. It is concluded that radiation damage in spheneanneals out in a multistage process as reflected in the patterns exhibitedby the TL sensitivity.</TEXT></DOC>
