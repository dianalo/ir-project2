Claude Pepper, whoselarger-than-life national status made his congressional seatuntouchable, has unleashed a frenzy of speculation and backroompoliticking over his replacement.   Florida Republicans see an opportunity to bolster their newmajority in the state's congressional delegation by nominating andelecting the first Cuban-American representative.   Democrats have promised to campaign under the banner of Pepper,who had held the 18th District seat since its inception in 1962.   The date of the special election will be set after today'sfuneral for Pepper, who died Tuesday at age 88.   ``It's sort of like a chess game,'' said Mayor Xavier Suarez,who was busy last week trying to broker his political influencewith possible candidates in hopes of boosting his political capital.   ``The alliances are shifting by the hour,'' Suarez said inbetween phone calls. ``It's like an earthquake; a hole opens up andthen it gets filled in.''   State GOP Chairman Van Poole and John Buckley, spokesman for theRepublican Congressional Campaign Committee, said the partybelieves it can win the seat, which covers most of Miami and MiamiBeach and some suburban areas.   But Dade County Democratic Chairman Simon Ferro said: ``As faras we are concerned, this is going to be the Claude Pepper memorialseat.''   The Republican Party in Florida is coming off its mostsuccessful election since Reconstruction.   Besides giving George Bush his largest margin over MichaelDukakis of any state in the presidential election _ nearly 1million votes _ Florida elected Republican Connie Mack to replaceretired Democrat Sen. Lawton Chiles, won two congressional seatsfrom the Democrats and took a 10-9 lead in the delegation whenDemocratic Rep. Bill Grant switched parties.   Florida is expected to gain at least three congressional seatsafter the 1990 census, and Democrats see the elections that year asa watershed.   ``We're on edge here,'' state Rep. Mike Abrams, a Democrat whosedistrict includes North Miami Beach. ``All the trend lines arewrong. We need a win.''   Pepper's district reflects the changes in Florida politics.   When carved out for Pepper, who earlier had served 14 years inthe Senate, it was filled with retirees from the Northeat. Thepercentage of voters calling themselves Democrats has dropped in adecade from 72 percent to 54 percent. A little less than 50 percentof residents are Hispanic, many of them Cuban exiles solidly behindPresidents Reagan and Bush.   Pepper won every 1980s election by a landslide and drew noopposition last year. He was a holdover New Deal liberal whoadopted a tough anti-communist viewpoint.   ``Claude Pepper transcended politics,'' said Miami Beach MayorAlex Daoud. ``He was just unique. ... He was not a politician, hewas a statesman.''   Daoud, coming off a lopsided re-election victory in 1987, isamong the likely Democratic candidates to replace Pepper.   Another is Hialeah Mayor Raul Martinez. The Cuban-born mayor ofthe 80 percent Hispanic city since 1981 said he wouldn't comment onhis plans until later this week.   Other Democratic speculation has focused upon state Sen. JackGordon, who shares most of Pepper's constituency and liberalism.But Gordon, 67, may be hamstrung because of his opposition to U.S.aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, whose cause is popular among localHispanics.   The Republicans have several promising Hispanic politicians tofield.   State Reps. Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Al Gutman, and state Sen.Ileana Ros-Lehtinen are among those mentioned most.   Ros-Lehtinen's husband, U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, a VietnamWar hero and former state legislator, had been considered a likelycandidate but has said lately he is content in his current job.</TEXT></DOC>
