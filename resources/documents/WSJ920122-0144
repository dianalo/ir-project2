No matter: His wife, Shoshana, soon took his place atJinsa, which was busily working to step up contacts withmilitary officials in the U.S.</LP><TEXT>   Today, the 49-year-old Mr. Bryen is back serving onJinsa's advisory board, even as he is a paid Pentagonconsultant -- with a security clearance -- on exports ofsensitive U.S. technology. Michael Ledeen, an early player inthe Iran-Contra affair and fellow Pentagon consultant, serveswith him on the Jinsa board, as does Richard Perle, a formerhigh-ranking Pentagon official who remains an adviser toDefense Secretary Richard Cheney.   This tight little circle illustrates an enduring networkof Cold War conservatives and pro-Israel interests inWashington. Some, like Messrs. Bryen and Perle, began asSenate aides but achieved greater power in the Reaganadministration. From arms sales to export controls, theyrelished behind-the-scene battles affecting East-West tradeand Israel's vital military relationship with the U.S.   Although the Cold War is over, their political andgovernmental ties are a source of influence for pro-Israeliforces. And following their years of government service,their contacts and experience in foreign relations andtechnology-transfer are paying off in their private lives aswell.   With little fanfare, Jinsa itself has carved out a nicheby both cultivating closer U.S.-Israeli military ties andurging U.S. Jews to vote for a strong defense at home.Building support in the Pentagon is a high priority. Under aprogram called &quot;Send a General to Israel,&quot; hundreds ofthousands of dollars in tax-deductible contributions bankrollan annual tour of Israel by retired U.S. generals andadmirals. They exchange views with Israeli officials and tourstrategic areas like the Golan Heights.   &quot;This is a trip to educate, explore, confront the issues,&quot;explains Marsha Halteman, Jinsa's national finance director.As Israel and the U.S. sort out their relationship in apost-Cold War world, adds Thomas Neumann, the executivedirector, Jinsa's work now is &quot;more crucial&quot; than ever.Beginning in 1990, U.S. military cadets were included in asimilar tour program.   Jinsa's founders include Max Kampelman, an arms-controlnegotiator whose old law firm is a U.S. agent for Israeligovernment and military interests. Singer Frank Sinatra, abusiness client of one of Jinsa's leaders, is a patron of theorganization. Within the defense industry, Northrop Corp.executive James Roche is a member. Northrop itself bought a$2,500 table at a Jinsa dinner in October honoring SecretaryCheney.   Within government, the relationship between Messrs. Bryenand Perle discloses the little-understood world governing theexport of U.S. technology abroad. It is a combativebureaucratic process with farreaching impacts onmanufacturers of machine tools, computers andtelecommunications equipment, as well as weapons.   All sides engage in the internal warfare. Angry withthen-Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon over his militarypolicies, the Pentagon retaliated in the early 1980s byslowing export licenses to Israel. More recently, the U.S.intensified scrutiny of licenses for the joint U.S.-IsraeliArrow defense program, in an apparent effort to pressureIsrael to agree last month to international controls onmissile technology.   But this regulatory machinery can also be turned toIsrael's advantage -- easing restrictions for the country'sbenefit, critics say, or denying technology to its rivals.Brazil, for instance, whose defense industry competes in somemarkets with Israel, has been subjected to U.S. restrictionsthat go beyond any danger it poses as a source of armsproliferation, Brazil's supporters claim.   Mr. Perle parlayed his close ties with Defense SecretaryCaspar Weinberger to consolidate his grip over Pentagonexport controls. Mr. Bryen rose behind him as his deputy andlater the first head of the Defense Technology SecurityAdministration.   Best known for its fierce opposition to the transfer oftechnology to the Soviet bloc, the Perle-Bryen team alsoreflected the pro-Israel sentiment of the Reaganadministration. Mr. Perle bristles at the notion offavoritism.   &quot;The suggestion that we can't function in governmentobjectively if we're pro-Israeli is wrong,&quot; he says. Hisdeputy, Mr. Bryen, who held power largely because of Mr.Perle's clout, was the more outspoken, and drew skepticismwithin government.   A senior law-enforcement official says that in themid-1980s Mr. Bryen, while serving at the Pentagon,telephoned then-Customs Commissioner William von Raab andanother top Customs official, Leonard Walton, to complainabout investigations of alleged export violations by Israel.Mr. von Raab, a friend of Mr. Bryen, says: &quot;I have a lot ofconversations with Steve Bryen, {who} is always complainingabout something. He didn't make a special effort that sticksin my mind. Whether he had made a complaint in passing, Ican't confirm, but I won't say it didn't happen.&quot; Mr. Waltondeclined to comment. Mr. Bryen denies complaining to Messrs.von Raab and Walton.   Additionally, a former Pentagon official says RichardArmitage, then an assistant secretary of defense, admonishedMr. Bryen in 1988 for trying to push through an exportlicense for Israel despite strong objections from seniormilitary officers. Mr. Bryen says that by denying thelicense, the U.S. had only made it harder to get Israelicooperation on broader export-control issues. His Pentagondecisions, he says, were motivated &quot;solely by a desire toadvance the interests of the United States.&quot;   Mr. Bryen says he severed his ties with Jinsa while inpublic service, but his wife, Shoshana, served as theexecutive director through most of his Pentgon tenure. Herduties included fund raising and drafting Jinsa editorialsrelated to technology controls. Her salary, which ran as highas $55,000, was financed by contributions from pro-Israeldonors and some defense companies. But the Bryens say her joband salary posed no conflict of interest for him.   Messrs. Bryen and Perle also made alliances in governmentthat have helped them since. At the Pentagon, Mr. Perle was aproponent of aid to Turkey's military. He now serves as apaid consultant to a Turkish-hired lobbying firm inWashington and has been both an adviser to FMC Corp. and adirector of an FMC-Turkish joint venture building militaryequipment. Mr. Perle also serves as a director of MemorexCorp., a defense contractor, and advises Secretary Cheney asa member of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee.   As a consultant to his old technology agency, Mr. Bryen ispaid $267 for each day he works and enjoys securityclearances giving him access to classified information. Healso serves as a consultant to a law firm, Marks, Murase andamp;White, which dealt with his former Pentagon office in recentyears and whose clients have included such Japanesemachine-tool companies as Sodick Co. and Toshiba Machine Co.Mr. Bryen earned $25,000 as well in 1990 from a Tokyothink-tank, financed by Japanese industry, which hired him toprepare papers on export controls, he says.   Most important have been Mr. Bryen's activities as anofficer and owner of a company financed by Ronald Lauder, awealthy cosmetics heir who himself was a senior Pentagonofficial. A generous financial patron of Jinsa, Mr. Lauderhired Mr. Bryen as the $125,000-a-year president of a newlyformed company, Delta Tech Corp., to advise Mr. Lauder onhigh-technology business opportunities. With the companyfloundering under Mr. Bryen's leadership, Mr. Laudertransferred his ownership of it to Mr. Bryen in mid-1991. Mr.Lauder, who put $2.7 million into the company, sold it to Mr.Bryen for a nominal $9, according to those familiar with thetransaction. Mr. Bryen says he assumed the firm's obligationsand denies that the transaction was a gift.   Earlier, Mr. Bryen got a helping hand when his formerPentagon agency designated Delta Tech for a $157,000subcontract on a defense job awarded to another firm,according to a senior Defense Department official. Under thesubcontract, Delta Tech has been helping evaluate Iraq'sefforts to acquire military technology.   Mr. Bryen responded by saying that under the subcontracthis company unearthed information that &quot;should be ofsignificance in helping halt the Iraqi nuclear weaponsprogram.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
