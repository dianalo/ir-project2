That should translateinto good news for borrowers.   Costs of a variety of loans, including mortgage rates and homeequity loans, all are expected to head lower through the rest of thesummer, private economists say.   The Federal Open Market Committee, composed of members of theFederal Reserve Board in Washington and five of the 12 regional Fedbank presidents, will meet Wednesday and Thursday for an importantmid-year review of where monetary policy is going.   The central bank, through its control of interest rates and thenation's money supply, has a powerful influence over the course ofthe economy. It strives to provide enough credit to keep the economyexpanding while guarding against supplying so much money thatinflation is rekindled.   In March 1988, the Federal Reserve began a credit-tighteningeffort which drove interest rates up by 3 full percentage points,depressing the housing market and sales of such big-ticket items asautos.   But last month, in a major policy shift, the central bank sent akey interest rate, the federal funds rate, down by 0.25 percentagepoint to around 9.5 percent.   This rate, which is the interest that banks charge each other tomake overnight loans, is considered the best early-warning signal ofFed intentions. The central bank influences the rate through dailydecisions on how much money it will make available to the bankingsystem.   In advance of Wednesday's closed-door meeting, many privateeconomists suggested the FOMC will decide to push the funds ratedown by another one-fourth percentage point.   ``I expect an easing move because I believe that the Fed is alittle scared about the recent weak economic data and thepossibility we could be heading for a recession,'' said LawrenceChimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group, an economicconsulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.   The central bank has been struggling to keep alive the recordpeacetime economic recovery, now in its seventh year, by engineeringa ``soft-landing'' for the economy. Under that scenario, growthwould slow enough this year to dampen inflationary pressures but notso much that the country was plunged into a recession.   Whether the central bank can realize its hopes is an openquestion at the current time. Last week's big drop in the stockmarket was blamed on growing fears that the country is headed for adownturn later this year.   Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association ofManufacturers, noted that a variety of business barometers,including factory orders, are pointing to significant weakness.   ``The economy is slowing more rapidly than expected and underliesthe need for the Fed to act promptly to ease monetary policy,'' hesaid. ``Failure to act soon may turn the soft landing into arecession.''   But David Wyss, senior economist at DRI-McGraw Hill of Lexington,Mass., said he believed the central bank would be able to keepinflation under control without throwing the economy into a slump.   ``We think interest rates are coming down fast enough that thiswill be a soft landing,'' Wyss said.   Mortgage rates are already falling. And Wyss predicted 30-yearmortgages would dip to around 9.5 percent by September.   Other economists forecast a further one-half percentage pointdrop in banks' prime lending rate in August.   Robert Dederick, executive vice president for Northern Trust Co.of Chicago, said chairman Alan Greenspan and the other FederalReserve officials have no choice but to pursue their current gradualeasing strategy, given pressure from the Bush administration andCongress to keep the economy out of a recession.   ``You don't have a public mandate at present to suffer the painto make sure that inflation is under control,'' he said. ``Inflationis always a threat when you start easing credit. But if you waituntil inflation isn't a threat, you have waited right into arecession.''</TEXT></DOC>
