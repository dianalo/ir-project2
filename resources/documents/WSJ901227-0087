The first large-scale testing of a new geneticallyengineered clotting protein, called recombinant factor VIII,shows that it works as well as the natural variety of factorVIII derived from human blood plasma. The development couldallow hemophiliacs to routinely take preventative doses, asdiabetics take insulin, one specialist says.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's a tremendous advance and one we are all excitedabout for the hemophiliac community,&quot; said Dr. Jeanne M.Lusher, who tested the new material at Children's Hospital ofMichigan in Detroit.   Hemophilia is caused by a genetic defect that's passedfrom mothers to sons and afflicts about 20,000 American men.Patients fail to produce enough factor VIII, a proteinnecessary for the body to form clots to stop bleeding.Without treatment, cuts may bleed for days into joints,causing crippling deformities.   Injections of factor VIII derived from donated blood cancontrol bleeding. But early in the acquired immune deficiencysyndrome epidemic, factor VIII was widely tainted with HIV,the AIDS virus, though no one knew it at the time. As aresult, about 60% of hemophiliacs are infected with HIV, eventhough most do not have AIDS.   New purification techniques have made factor VIII free ofHIV, but some specialists worry that some new microbe mightsilently infiltrate this treatment again if blood remains thesole source.   Now, two companies are competing to introduce factor VIIImade by inserting a human gene into animal tissue that churnsout the protein in large quantities. Since they involve noblood, the products should not contain viruses or potentiallyharmful human proteins that can slip through purificationprocesses.   Last year, Baxter Healthcare Corp., a unit of BaxterInternational Inc., reported on preliminary use of itsvariety of recombinant factor VIII on two patients. Intoday's New England Journal of Medicine, Cutter Biologicaldescribed results of testing its competing product on 107hemophiliacs. Both forms of factor VIII are being consideredfor approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.   Most of the patients in the study have been using thegenetically engineered factor VIII for nearly two years. Thetreatment effectively controlled their bleeding and caused nounwanted side effects.   &quot;It offers the potential for people with hemophilia tohave an interim cure,&quot; said Alan Brownstein, executivedirector of the National Hemophilia Foundation.</TEXT></DOC>
