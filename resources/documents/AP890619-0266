(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chris Peters stretched for words as hetried to describe how he makes his living.   ``It's hard to even explain sometimes what you're thinking whenyou're writing a program,'' said Peters, a software developer forMicrosoft Corp. ``You're not thinking in English. It's hard even todescribe the thought process.   ``You actually are the computer at the point you're writing theprogram.''   Whether or not he can articulate it, Peters can do it. He's oneof just 12 computer programmers who work on the Microsoft Excelspreadsheet program.   The bookkeeping program is one of Microsoft's key products, itsweapon for capturing market share from Lotus Development Corp.'s1-2-3, the best-selling spreadsheet program.   As much as any modern product, software epitomizes what is meantby the knowledge economy.   Microsoft and other software companies' physical products are buta few dollars' worth of magnetic tape or disks, a manual and acatchy package.   What people pay for is the computer code, the abstraction of aphysical process such as record-keeping that allows a computer andits operator to do complex functions in split seconds.   The raw materials are the ideas of the companies' programmers andengineers, marketers and managers. It's what their people know andhow well they can express it that brings in the money.   Founded just 15 years ago by William Gates and Paul Allen,Microsoft is now the largest company specializing in personalcomputer software.   Gates and Allen also provided an information-age legend: a coupleof college kids who wrote a language program for a computer theyread about in an electronics magazine, and turned that asset into acorporation worth hundreds of millions of dollars.   Gates' stock made him the youngest self-made billionaire ever.   Programmers all over the country, working at the kitchen table orsmall offices, still try to emulate Gates. But in the big leagues,where programs can reach 450,000 lines of computer code, makingsoftware has long since expanded from a one-brain concoction.   At Microsoft's headquarters in a fir-shaded suburban Seattleoffice park, the workfloor for Excel is a long hallway lined withcompact offices. The wing has the atmosphere of graduate studentcubicles in a large university _ if there's a college where studentscan afford BMWs.   Down the hall is a room with pinball and video games. Standardoffice decor is mounds of paper and three to six personal computers.One programmer, Eddy Fries, has turned an old computer monitor intoa tropical fishbowl.   The flip side of the frisbees and amateur jugglers who come outon nice days is an intensity where arguments and egos can flare andwork can go on around the clock to make deadlines.   That's what comes in a company where ``the norm is near-geniuslevel and not just in smarts but in creativity and everythingelse,'' Peters said.   ``If you love what you're doing and people say, `Oh, but you'reat work all the time.' Well, yeah, right. This is fun, right?''   Peters, 31, joined the company in 1981 as the 100th employee, andis now about 40th in seniority in a company that employs about 3,800.   What keeps him, he said, is that Microsoft and Gates _ himself aprogrammer _ treat software writers ``like prima donnas.''   Stewart Alsop, publisher of the industry newsletter P.C. Letter,agrees. While Microsoft executives may give speeches about the needfor industry standards, Alsop says that doesn't stop their owndevelopers from violating the rules if the program demands it.   ``They focus on the very essentials of software _ does it do whatpeople want it to do?''   Microsoft assigns far fewer programmers to a team than do othersoftware giants. Where Lotus has 12 to more than 30 programmersworking on versions of 1-2-3, Microsoft's 12-member team creates allthree forms of Excel _ for Apple Macintosh, MS-DOS and OS-2operating systems _ plus foreign translations.   Although Lotus' teams are larger, Frank Ingari, vice presidentfor Lotus' personal spreadsheet computer division, agrees you can'tget quality by designing by committee.   ``No matter how many are on the team you find a small number whoare the actual architects,'' he said.   Peters said 95 percent of writing the intricate code that makes aprogram work is simply an individual programmer staring at a screen,puzzling it out until the solution comes. ``He'll sit there andhe'll think real hard. And he might walk around the halls _ he mightfind some guy and corner him and just talk at him.''   Hallways are a big deal at Microsoft, Peters said. ``You workprivately but together. It's kind of weird.''   Though programmers build new features on blocks of code writtenbefore, and may use programs to edit and search code for bugs,Peters doesn't put much faith in programs that claim to actuallywrite software.   ``No, we do it the old-fashioned way. I mean, what kind of junkwould be generated by a machine?''   In a way, Peters said, writing software is like designing abuilding _ bad code is ``an awful bit of carpentry that won't holdthe roof up.'' It's also like mastering a foreign language _ ``ittakes a few years to even know how to read the stuff and know thatit's good.''   Or maybe, he said, it's like composing music.   ``The stuff can be very beautiful, and the funny thing, the usernever sees it,'' Peters said. ``You can look at someone's code andit will flow. There will just be this elegance to it.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday June 25</NOTE></DOC>
