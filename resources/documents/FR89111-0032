Thisproposed rule would affect future surface coal mining operations on landswithin National Parks, Wildlife Refuges, Wilderness Areas, Wild and ScenicRivers, the National System of Trails, and National Recreation Areas. Inaddition, this proposed rule would affect future surface coal mining operationsthat would adversely affect places listed on the National Register of HistoricPlaces or any publicly owned park, or operations within a National Forestor within 100 feet of cemeteries and public roads, or within 300 feet ofoccupied dwellings, public buildings, schools, churches, and public parks.The proposed action and alternatives are as follows: <T3>Alternative A1 (No Action): Modified All Permits/Prohibitions ApplyThrough State Programs.</T3>_Under Alternative Al, coal mining in section522(e) areas would be regulated as it is now. VER is established by themodified all permits standard. An applicant must demonstrate that he/shehad obtained, or made a good-faith effort to obtain, all permits necessaryfor surface coal mining operations prior to August 3, 1977. Under thisalternative, almost no one would qualify for VER, and no surface miningor related impacts are expected on any of the prohibited areas identifiedin section 522(e). Provisions relating to subsidence in section 522(e)areas vary by State and allow a range of subsidence effects from undergroundmining in the 522(e) areas. <T3>Alternative B1: Modified All Permits/Total Prohibition.</T3>_UnderAlternative B1, VER for surface coal mining operations (including off-sitepreparation plants) would be established by the modified all permits standardas described under Alternative A1. Because almost no one would qualifyfor VER under this standard, there would be virtually no surface miningor off-site preparation plants in 522(e) areas. No underground mining orsurface impacts of adjacent underground mining would be allowed in section522(e) areas. <T3>Alternative P1 (Proposed Action): Modified All Permits/No Subsidence.</T3>_UnderAlternative P1, VER for surface coal mining operations (including off-sitepreparation plants) would be established by the modified all permits standardas described under A1. Because almost no one would qualify for VER underthis standard, there would be virtually no surface mining or off-site preparationplants in 522(e) areas. Underground mining would be allowed within protectedzones currently delineated in section 522(e), but surface facilities andany measurable subsidence in the reasonably foreseeable future would beprohibited. The mine operator would be allowed to use whatever means areavailable to meet this performance standard. <T3>Alternative P2 (Proposed Action): Modified All Permits/No MaterialDamage.</T3>_Alternative P2 is similar to P1, except that under P2, someunderground coal mining in 522(e) areas would be allowed, but surface facilitiesand subsidence that causes material damage to protected lands, featuresand structures would be prohibited. <T3>Alternative E1: Modified All Permits/Prohibitions Not Applicable.</T3>_UnderAlternative E1, VER would be established using the modified all permitsstandard. Because virtually no one would qualify for VER, there would beno surface coal mining or off-site preparation plants in 522(e) areas.The prohibitions of section 522(e), however, would not apply to subsidenceresulting from underground mining. Operations would still be required eitherto (a) adopt measures to prevent subsidence from causing material damage,maximize mine stability, and maintain the value and reasonably foreseeableuse of surface lands; or (b) adopt measures that provide for planned subsidence.<T3>Alternative P3 (Proposed Action): Ownership and Authority._</T3>UnderAlternative P3, the person claiming VER would need to show the right toextract the coal by the method intended, as determined by the laws of theState in which the property is located. To establish VER for off-site preparationplants, an operator would have to show the right to use the land and haveall the permits needed before August 3, 1977.Most owners of private coal rights in section 522(e) areas would be ableto establish VER for underground mining, and the prohibitions of 522(e)would therefore not apply to underground mining. In addition, some operatorswould be able to establish VER for surface mining within the 522(e) areas.Very few new off-site preparation plants would be established within 522(e)areas. Applicability of the prohibitions of 552(e) to subsidence wouldbe relevant only in those few cases where an operator would not be ableto establish VER for the proposed method of mining.Under this alternative, almost all the non-Federal coal in 522(e) areascould be underground mined, and some could be surface mined.<T3>Takings Alternative.</T3>_Under this alternative, an applicant forVER would have to demonstrate that the person has property rights, as definedby the laws of the State in which the property is located, such that, ifthe mining permit is denied, the denial would effect a taking of propertythat would entitle the person to just compensation under the fifth andfourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution. Although the effectof the Takings Alternative for VER cannot be quantitatively analyzed inthis supplement, the impacts would be similar to those discussed underA1, B1, P1, and P2, except that less land would be subject to the prohibitions.The analysis considers the general effects on the human environment thatmight occur as a result of coal mining under the various alternatives.The analysis is based on assumptions concerning where coal is likely tobe produced to meet the Nation's energy needs and the level of that production.These will be determined in part by the availability of coal based on therestrictions imposed under each alternative, that is, the standard usedto establish VER and how the subsidence restrictions are applied. Thishas a direct correlation with the effect of coal mining on the environment.OSMRE will limit oral testimony at these hearings to 10 minutes. Additionaltime may be granted at the discretion of the presiding officer based onthe number of speakers registered. OSMRE encourage speakers to providea written text of prepared comments, regardless of length, to help ensurethat OSMRE has an accurate record.Persons who wish to speak should sign the register before the hearing begins.After the last registered speaker has been heard, the hearing officer willconsider the request of any other person present who wishes to speak. Anyperson present may speak; however, only one person will be allowed to representthe viewpoints of any organization.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 4, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Brent Wahlquist,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Assistant Director, Program Policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-356 Filed 1-10-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4310-05-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
