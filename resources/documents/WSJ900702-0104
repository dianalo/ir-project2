He's the Republican theorist who helped evictthem from the White House more than two decades ago.   Kevin Phillips, generally credited with coming up withRichard Nixon's &quot;emerging Republican majority&quot; in 1968, isbeing quoted by Democrats all over town and denounced byRepublicans as a &quot;fraud&quot; whose new book is &quot;garbage.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Phillips, an owlish Republican political analyst, isdeveloping a cult following among Democrats, who believe hiscritique of Reaganism and Republicanism may help them regaincontrol of the White House. &quot;Kevin,&quot; says Democratic partychairman Ronald Brown, &quot;has crystallized a lot of things.&quot;   Mr. Phillips calls the Republican 1980s a decade ofexcesses and binges. He accuses the GOP of becoming the partyof greed. And he blames Ronald Reagan and George Bush for&quot;the new political economics, intensifying inequality andpain for the poor, the unprecedented growth of upper-bracketwealth, the surprisingly related growth of the federal debt.&quot;   In a city whose cultural life seldom reaches beyondnewspaper clippings and television sound bites, Mr.Phillips's &quot;The Politics of Rich and Poor&quot; (Random House, 263pages., $19.95) is the rare book that roils the capital'swaters. Rep. David Obey, a leading Democratic voice oneconomic issues, was so anguished when he left his copy onhis desk that he called his office and asked an aide to runit over to him at National Airport so he could finish it on atrip back to his Wisconsin district.   &quot;This is not the Brookings Institution or Harvard sayingthese things,&quot; observes Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana,chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.&quot;It's coming from within the Republican Party.&quot;   The Phillips thesis is that in the Reagan years the richbecame richer; the income of the top 1% of Americans rose tomore than 11% of the nation's total income in 1988 from 9% in1980. Meanwhile, large chunks of the nation's population wereon a slide of &quot;downward mobility.&quot; The result, he says, ismore economic losers than winners, with a large number ofAmericans &quot;facing deteriorating personal or family incomes ora vague but troubling sense of harder times ahead.&quot;   Mr. Phillips argues that the Reagan era represents thethird of what he calls &quot;Republican heydays of wealthconcentration.&quot; He says that after the first two, the GildedAge that ran from the mid-1870s through the early 1890s andthe Republican ascendancy of the 1920s, came an economicdownturn and a populist reaction. He raises the question ofwhether the U.S. is on the verge of a third burst of populismand reform.   Mr. Phillips, whose book made the capital-area best-sellerlist of the Washington Post only a week after it becameavailable, isn't discomfited by the praise it has receivedfrom his erstwhile rivals. He believes his effort might beworthwhile if the GOP &quot;pays a lot more attention to theaverage guy again.&quot;   For all their exultation over Mr. Phillips's argument,some Democrats are troubled that this critique should emergefrom Mr. Phillips's word processor. &quot;It is the sign of manyof the problems we have,&quot; says Democratic pollster HarrisonHickman, &quot;that it takes a Republican analyst to make our owncase.&quot;   Even so, many Democrats are pleased to have that caseaired in such a deliciously ironic fashion and to have newattention on the contrast between what Mr. Phillips calls&quot;proliferating billionaires and the tens of millions who weregradually sinking&quot; in the 1980s.   &quot;It's the kind of book you'd expect to be written by aDemocrat,&quot; Mr. Obey says.   That's precisely what a lot of Republicans are saying.   &quot;I refuse to read that fraud's book,&quot; says John Buckley, aRepublican political consultant. &quot;The man is a liberalDemocrat corporatist who despises entrepreneurship, Reaganismand conservatism. Anyone who can deliver cornpone Marxism ina Locust Valley lockjaw and get called a conservative ispulling a swindle off on someone.&quot;   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia believesthat Mr. Phillips, in focusing on the success of the wealthyin the Reagan years, is suffering from a kind of politicalastigmatism.   &quot;Phillips is saying that people will be offended by aparty that allows a few big trees in the forest but alsoprotects your right to plant your own tree as anentrepreneur,&quot; Mr. Gingrich says. &quot;We're arguing that peopleare more turned off by a party which promises to cut down thebiggest trees in the forest but to overregulate and overtaxyou so you won't be able to plant your own tree.&quot;   Democrats who tread deeply into the pages of Mr.Phillips's book will find little comfort, however. He arguesthat Democratic leaders are responding to the GOP much astheir party forebears did to earlier Republican heydays:&quot;cowed, conformist and often supportive of the prevailingentrepreneurial, free-market mood.&quot;   But such Democrats as House Majority Leader RichardGephardt of Missouri say that Mr. Phillips &quot;understands whatthe last 10 years have meant to working people.&quot; Democraticpollster Celinda Lake believes that the Phillips book and thecontretemps that it has stirred may highlight what she calls&quot;fundamental fault lines in the Republican coalition.&quot; Sheadds: &quot;It's a whistle in Democratic ears, if only we'lllisten.&quot;   The bookish Mr. Phillips is an unlikely protagonist in thefirst passionate ideological debate of the summer. A49-year-old graduate of Colgate University and Harvard LawSchool, Mr. Phillips was an adviser to Richard Nixon's 1968presidential campaign. For the past two decades he haspublished a political newsletter and now also publishes abiweekly on business and public-affairs issues. He givesspeeches to corporate groups and provides political analysison television public-affairs shows. (He is also a member ofthis newspaper's panel of political experts.)   In recent years, however, he has strayed widely from theprevailing winds within the Republican Party, though alwaysclinging to the conservative label.   &quot;I don't remember once at Heritage when Kevin Phillips'sideas have come up as something significant,&quot; says StuartButler, director of domestic policy for the conservativethink tank that buttressed much of the policy underpinning ofthe Reagan revolution. &quot;He just doesn't figure in deepdiscussions about where the conservative movement is going.&quot;   White House aides curtly dismiss Mr. Phillips's book,which carries only two promotional blurbs, one from Mr. Nixonand the other from Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York.But leading conservatives are enraged by it. Rep. SteveGunderson (R., Wis.) argues that Republicans &quot;are broadeningour base much more than the Democrats are doing.&quot; Eddie Mahe,a Republican political consultant, calls the book &quot;garbage&quot;and adds: &quot;Maybe he calculated that the best way to sell alot of books is to make a lot of outrageous statements.&quot;   Mr. Phillips is taking the criticism with equanimity. &quot;Iwas involved enough in the beginning of this Republican erathat I have combat medals,&quot; he says. &quot;And I frankly don'tthink much of some of the dynamics of the 1980s.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
