The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said fixed rates fell 0.09percentage point to 11.50 percent. The April fixed rate of 11.59 hadbeen the highest since December 1985, when rates averaged 12.01percent.   Rates on adjustable-rate mortgages rose 0.14 percentage point to10.29 percent in early May, the highest since December 1985, whenrates averaged 10.39 percent, the bank board said.   The drop in the fixed rate reflected an easing of other long-terminterest rates, the bank board said. Interest rates overall beganfalling recently after being propped up by the Federal Reserve for15 months to stem inflation.   ``The increase in the ARM rate was caused primarily by a decreasein the number of institutions offering first-year, below-market,`teaser' rates on these types of loans,'' according to James Barth,the bank board's chief economist.   Barth said because of the higher rates for adjustable-ratemortgages, ``the ARMS portion of all loans closed declined to 53percent in early May, down from 55 percent in the previous month andthe smallest in a year.''   Last Friday, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., known asFreddie Mac, reported fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.48 percentlast week, down from 10.50 percent a week earlier. On one-yearadjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initialrate of 9.21 percent, up from 9.18 percent the week before.   The Freddie Mac figures are lower than those reported by the bankboard because they do not include add-on fees, known as points,often paid by borrowers.</TEXT></DOC>
