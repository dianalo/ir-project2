First, the theoretical considerationsof applying relational operations to distributed data was consideredto provide an underlying data distribution and parallel-processing environmentmodel. Next, analytical models were constructed to evaluate various implementationsof the select, project, and join relational operations and the updateoperations of addition, deletion, and modification for a range of datastructures and architectural configuration. To predict the performanceof the query processor for all cases, the individual-operator modelsneeded to be extended to models for complex queries consisting of severalrelational operations. These models provide the capability to model thepotential of different forms of parallelism in solving complex queries.The results of the analytical models present a logical design for a multi-processorquery processor.</TEXT></DOC>
