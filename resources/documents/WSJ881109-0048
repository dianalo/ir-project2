The NLRB contended that Arrow Automotive improperly closed its Hudson, Mass., plant in 1981 after a strike. The board then ordered the company to pay the plant's 225 employees wages they would have earned had the plant remained open. Arrow appealed the NLRB decision and last August the appeals court declared the closure &quot;an exercise of entrepreneurial direction and control which was not subject to the duty of mandatory bargaining.&quot;    The NLRB had until Nov. 1 to appeal the ruling. &quot;But no appeal was filed,&quot; an Arrow Automotive spokesman said.    NLRB officials were not available for comment.    Arrow makes automotive parts and construction equipment. </TEXT></DOC>
