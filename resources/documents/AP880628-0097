British Airways, joining Air France in confidence that the planeis safe, put its two A320s back on the schedule today after aprecautionary suspension.   Air France's first A320 flight since Sunday's suspension tookoff from Paris bound for Duesseldorf and Berlin with 102 passengersaboard. Seven people who had reservations failed to claim theirseats, a normal ``no-show'' rate for a European route, the companysaid.   An inquiry commission was set up to determine why the plane,flying 30 feet above the ground at an air show in eastern France onSunday, failed to climb and crashed into a wooded area, killingthree people and injuring 50 others.   The Transport Ministry defended the new jet at a news conferenceMonday, saying there was no reason to doubt the plane'sperformance. Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that makesthe plane, said there were indications of human error.   Daniel Tennenbaum, head of the Civil Aviation Authority, andstate prosecutor Jean Volff said preliminary investigations showedthe Airbus was flying too low. Tennenbaum said the computerizedplane required eight seconds to respond to the command of thepilot, who only had five seconds to maneuver because of thealtitude.   Pilot Michel Hasseline was quoted by the French press as sayingthe aircraft did not respond to his efforts to increase power.Christian Roger, president of the Air France pilot's union, saidthe engines may have failed to restart at Hasseline's command.   The pilots' and mechanics' unions contend that safety requires athird officer in the cockpit of A320s _ in addition to pilot andco-pilot _ in case of a failure of the state-of-the-art computers.   In a joint statement Tuesday they protested that the inquirypanel was composed of supporters of the two-crew system.   Britain and France have a big stake, along with West Germany andSpain, in the 17-year-old consortium, Airbus Industrie.   The company has broken into the U.S.-dominated aircraft marketand employs some 150,000 people throughout Europe. Airbus says ithas more than 500 orders or letters of intent to purchase thenarrow-bodied, fuel-efficient, computerized plane.   Air France, like British Airways, has two 320s. Although no U.S.airline yet operates them, Northwest Airlines has ordered 100, andPan American World Airways has 16 on order, with an option to buy34 more.   More than 400 Airbus aircraft, including the wide-bodied A300,are in service around the world.</TEXT></DOC>
