The confinement ofradionuclide will depend on the geological formation of water non-movingzone in deep underground. Researches on confinement of nuclides in thegeological formation, especially on mineralization, in JAERI are described.Main items are; deposition in altered surface layer of vitrified wasteform after leaching, nuclides migration in rock, diffusion and depositioninto rock matrix around fracture zone and deposition on reducing materialsin sediment of seabed.</TEXT></DOC>
