The proposed new rules, scheduled to take effect in 1992, wouldrequire U.S. companies to deduct promised post-retirement medicaland insurance benefits as they are earned, or while an employee isstill working for the company.   It would eliminate the ``pay-as-you-go'' accounting methodcurrently used by most companies. As such, companies in many casesunder the new rule would have to deduct from their income statementsthe amount of the earned benefits, instead of simply deducting theamount the companies actually paid in a given year.   Critics of the proposal have complained that it would impactfinancial results too greatly, as well as being difficult to manage.   The new rules would deal only with financial reporting of benefitobligations but does not address the funding of pension benefits,FASB officials said.   The plan comes at a time of soaring health care costs, longerlife expectancy and earlier retirements which are posing economicproblems for many companies, according to FASB Chairman Dennis R.Beresford.   Beresford said the proposal would make financial statements moreinformative and complete and would enhance disclosure of promisedbenefits.   ``It will require companies to publicly acknowledge theirexisting commitments to investors and other users of financialstatements who in turn can evaluate the implications of thosepromises,'' Beresford said.   He also said the proposed accounting would not change the natureor extent of the current pension promises.   ``The cost of providing the promised benefits is the same beforeand after the proposed accounting is implemented,'' Beresford said.</TEXT></DOC>
