Pursuant to a requestfrom interested parties, the filing deadline was extended until November8, 1988. A total of 57 responses were filed. Comments were filed by 44poultry dealers, 7 state and national organizations, 4 state and nationalfarmer/producer organizations, a poultry grower and a poultry equipmentmanufacturer. Twenty-eight of the poultry dealer comments were from employeesof 7 firms. Ten of these comments were from one poultry dealer. For obviousreasons, consideration has been given to the opinions expressed as a wholerather than to the number of comments filed by the same firm or employeesof a firm which expressed the same opinion. This approach is essentialif fairness and equity are to prevail and credibility is to be maintainedin the rulemaking process.Fifty-three comments were filed in opposition to the proposed weighingamendment (9 CFR 201.82(b)) and the amendment that requires poultry dealersto file annual reports (9 CFR 201.97). Thirty-three of these comments simplyendorsed without further comment the comment filed by a major trade organizationin opposition to these two proposed amendments. One comment also opposedproviding requested business information needed to carry out the provisionsof the Packers and Stockyards Act (9 CFR 201.94). No objections were receivedregarding the balance of the proposed amendments.Three comments were received favoring all of the proposed amendments andone comment favored the weighing regulation amendment.All comments were carefully considered by the Agency.<ITAG tagnum="84">Time of Weighing</ITAG>Based on recent litigation and complaints from poultry growers with respectto the time of weighing, the Agency proposed to amend and clarify regulationandSection; 201.82 by revising paragraph (b) to require that poultry obtainedunder a growout contract be weighed for payment purposes immediately uponarrival at the processing plant or holding yard and that the poultry mustbe weighed no later than 12 hours after being removed from feed.Fifty-three comments were filed in opposition to the proposal. Many ofthese comments were merely endorsements of a comment filed by a major tradeassociation. Opposing comments centered around the 12-hour limitation betweenthe time the birds are taken off feed and the time of weighing. Concernwas expressed that the time limitation was too restrictive and could resultin higher risk of microbiological contamination from fecal material. Severalcomments suggested weather conditions, bird size, feed formulations andother factors affect the time required for feed digestion. Other commentsquestioned the time limitation in light of possible delays in weighingdue to truck breakdowns, adverse weather conditions, etc. One comment indicatedan increase in cost to the poultry dealer would result from the proposal.An opposing comment from a national farm organization stated that they``would support new weighing regulations if they are proposed in a newdocument and further clarification is provided on the 12 hour limitationfor weighing poultry and the interpretation of the term `immediately'.''Another opposing comment from a major poultry dealer stated that, ``Theweighing of poultry immediately upon arrival at the plant is a proper request,''but that the time off feed proposal is too restrictive.Four comments favoring the proposal were in agreement that the currentweighing regulations do not provide satisfactory protection to poultrygrowers and supported the weighing proposal as written. After review ofthe comments, the Agency has decided to delete the 12-hour time restrictionfrom the regulation as it is believed that it may be too restrictive undersome circumstances. Also, the phrase ``growout contract'' in the proposedregulation will be replaced with ``poultry growing arrangement'' to conformto the defined terms in Title I of the Packers and Stockyards Act. Theadopted regulation will require prompt transportation of poultry afterloading and immediate weighing on arrival at the processing plant, holdingyard or other scale location.<ITAG tagnum="84">Annual Reports</ITAG>It was proposed to add ``live poultry dealer'' to regulation andSection;201.97 thus requiring poultry dealers to file annual reports of their operations.A majority of those responding opposed this proposal, however, most merelyendorsed the objection filed by a major trade organization without furthercomment and ten were from the same firm.All the objections filed to the proposal were basically the same as thoseadvanced by the trade organization: (1) The information provided by annualreports would not provide the Agency with authority to act and would createan unnecessary burden on the industry, and (2) concern that the confidentialityof the sensitive information provided could not be maintained.It is recognized that neither jurisdiction nor authority to act is providedby information obtained from annual reports. The authority is providedby the statute itself. Information supplied by annual reports providesinformation to ``act on'' within the range of that authority. Annual reportinformation has long been a recognized means for channeling the Agency'sresources to the potential problem areas in the red meat industry in administeringsimilar provisions of the Act. It has been accepted well by the industryas a less burdensome alternative to the Agency conducting periodic auditswhich require time and personnel resources on the part of the firm as wellas the Agency.To the extent the comments in opposition to this proposal have impliedthat the Agency has no authority to act unless there is a failure to pay,they have been considered; however, it is the Agency's position that sucha position is not consistent with the intent and purpose of the amendmentsto the Act. The Committee on Agriculture in its report dated October 27,1987, on the Poultry Producers Financial Protection Act of 1987 includedthe following statement in reference to the purpose and need for the amendments:<ITAG tagnum="21">Moreover, the amendments made by the bill relating to prompt paymentand statutory trust are designed to ensure that those engaged in poultryproduction <T3>are protected </T3>from <T3>circumstances </T3>that could inflict heavy losses on an extremelyimportant segment of our nation's agricultural community. (Emphasis added)</ITAG>Clearly the Congress did not intend that the Secretary be given this rsponsibilitywithout also providing the authority to obtain information to carry outthis responsibility in the most efficient and expeditious way possible.Annual reports provide this information without any undue burden on theindustry.The nation's largest general farm organization and a supporter of the 1987poultry amendments to the Act recognized the need for this requirementin its comments stating:<ITAG tagnum="21">We recognize this requirement as an important management tool forPandamp;SA in order to direct their limited resources to the surveillanceof companies that are most likely to become problems. This requirementcould also be helpful to live poultry dealers and Pandamp;SA in heading offproblems before they occur.</ITAG>It has long been an established policy of Packers and Stockyards Administrationto obtain compliance with the payment provisions of the Act by informalmeans whenever possible. Some of the comments filed would indicate thatthe Agency has no authority to act except for the issuance of an administrativecomplaint and then only if there has been failure to pay. We believe thisposition is counterproductive and not in keeping with the intent and purposeof the amendments to provide information that enables the Agency and theindustry to work together to obtain correction and compliance on an informalbasis before losses occur.In reference to the opposition to this proposal based on the confidentialityof the information required to be supplied on annual reports, the Agencyhas a long history of recognizing the sensitivity of such information inthe red meat industry and has an established record of protecting the integrityof its relationship with the industry in this regard. Moreover, such informationis protected from unauthorized disclosure by the same law giving the Agencythe authority to obtain the information. It is absolutely essential thatthe Agency have the information necessary to help prevent losses beforethey occur whenever possible rather than to be continually engaged in ``moppingup'' operations after the damage is done. After consideration of all thecomments on the proposal, the Agency believes that the filing of annualreports by poultry dealers is necessary to provide such information, therefore,the amendment to regulation andSection; 201.97 is issued as proposed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Furnishing Business Information</ITAG>It was proposed to amend regulation andSection; 201.94 to require live poultrydealers to provide business information as requested. One comment was receivedin opposition to this proposal suggesting such information was unnecessaryto carry out the regulatory functions of Packers and Stockyards Administration.The Agency believes it is necessary to require subject firms to furnishbusiness information upon request in order to effectively conduct investigationsor inquiries and therefore regulation andSection; 201.94 will be adoptedas a final rule.No opposing comments were received to the proposed amendment to add ``livepoultry dealers'' to regulation andSection; 201.43, nor were there any commentsopposing amendments to regulations andSection;andSection; 210.49, 201.53, 201.71,201.73, 201.76, 201.82, 201.95, 201.96, 201.100 or policy statement andSection;203.4 which removes references to poultry ``handlers''. Likewise, amendingpolicy statement andSection; 203.15 dealing with trust notification proceduresto include poultry sellers and growers received no opposition. Accordingly,the above regulations and policy statements will be adopted as proposed,except for part (a) of regulation andSection; 201.71 which was previouslypublished as a final rule on February 1, 1989 (54 FR 5073). The referenceto ``poultry handlers'' in regulation andSection; 201.71(a) was removed bythe final rule published February 1, 1989 which updated the regulationto incorporate the current version of National Bureau of Standards Handbook44.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order</ITAG>Regulatory impact analysis is not required for these amendments becauseit has been determined that they are not ``major'' rules as defined bysection 1(b) of E.O. 12291. They will not have an annual effect on theeconomy of $100 million or more, and they will not result in major increasesin costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, government agencies,or geographic regions. They will not have significant adverse effects oncompetition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on theability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets.It has been determined that these amendments will not have significantimpact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, per E.O.of September 2, 1987, and will not have substantial direct effects on theStates, or the relationship between the national government and the States,or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the variouslevels of government, per E.O. of October 23, 1987.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>It has been determined that these amendments will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The number ofentities in the United States affected by the amendments is believed tobe about 350.The annual report form generally to be used for firms with less than $100,000in purchases or sales of live poultry, or value of live poultry obtainedunder poultry growing arrangements, is a one page form, and the publicreporting burden is estimated to average .33 hours (one third of one hour)per response. The number of these small firms is believed to be about 20.For all other firms, the public reporting burden for the longer annualreport form is estimated to average three hours per response.The compliance burden other than reporting is not expected to be significanteither.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980</ITAG>Information collection requirements contained in these regulations havebeen approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control No.0590-0001.Accordingly, 9 CFR Parts 201 and 203 are amended as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects In 9 CFR Parts 201 and 203</ITAG>Stockyards, Market agencies, Dealers, Packers, Live poultry dealers.<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 18th day of April 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">B.
