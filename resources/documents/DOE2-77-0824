Particular consideration is givento laser instabilities, dynamics in optical bistability, the characterizationof chaotic signals, quantum chaos, the effects of classical and quantumnoise, spatial instabilities, polarization effects, and four-wave mixingand phase conjugation. 92 references.</TEXT></DOC>
