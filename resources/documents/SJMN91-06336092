It was a brilliant move, later copied byother counties.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE MAGIC HALF-PENNYIF A 'SON OF MEASURE A' IS APPROVED, IT OUGHT TOFUND SPECIFIC, ONE-TIME PROJECTS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     But with the road program largely done and the tax due to phase out in1995, politicians and business leaders who want to renew the magic half-pennyfor other projects are nowhere near unanimity.;   The most obvious possibilityis that economically pinched taxpayers will take the politicos up on theiroriginal promise and let the tax expire after 10 years. This would leave about$280 million worth of roadwork unfinished. But it would also leave about $900million in the hands of local taxpayers over the coming decade.;   Measure Alegally must expire as scheduled. But there is increasing talk of a &quot;Son ofMeasure A&quot; -- a new tax, approved by voters next June and taking effect in1995, when the old tax dies.;   Pushing the idea is a coalition called TransitNow, whose participants include people who build and operate public transit,and others who simply seek faster commutes for their employees -- buildingtrades and transit unions, home builders, office park developers, surveyors,realtors, and the Santa Clara County Manufacturing Group, which played a majorrole in the 1984 campaign.;   According to Manufacturing Group President GaryBurke, the business people are interested in a new tax for transportation,such as finishing the freeway projects and financing new rail lines.;   Arelated option, pushed by County Supervisor Rod Diridon, is to use some of therevenue to operate the county's bus and light rail lines. A separate, ongoinghalf-cent sales tax and other sources now cover operating costs, but Diridonargues that by 1995 there will be a deficit.;   Alarmed that a drop in countysales tax collections will leave them unable to run trolleys and buses or tofinish the approved Tasman light rail line, Diridon and others see thepossible successors to Measure A as including another half-cent sales tax thatwould end in 2005; or a permanent quarter-cent sales tax to pay operatingexpenses.;   The possibilities are not limited to transit. Open spaceadvocates hope to snag about $8 million of the estimated $90 million a yearfrom any new half-cent tax. This is the same amount they would have gainedfrom a parcel tax that won 64 percent of the vote last year, but failed atwo-thirds requirement for passage. The money would fund the formation of anopen space district in Santa Clara County to buy open land, especiallyhillsides, and protect it from development. Because a new sales tax wouldrequire only simple majority approval, open space and transit advocates couldform a winning combination.;   County Supervisor Zoe Lofgren, maybe the mostvisible leader of the Measure A blitz in 1984, now argues that the roadprogram is mostly finished and that money from a new half-cent tax ought to beused to finance an ambitious but vaguely defined &quot;Kids' Initiative&quot; to pay forsupervising young children after school.;   Heaven knows, plenty of childrenneed more attention. But let's get real. Using a limited, one-time tax to payoperating costs, whether to run buses or help children, is foolish. If it's aworthy program, what do you do when the tax runs out?;   Building a rail lineand buying land for open space is a more logical use of this kind of tax, butnot if the initiative lists every far-fetched fantasy now on the county'sTransportation 2010 wish list.;   Next June's election won't come in the flushtimes of 1984; it'll be in the hard times of 1992. Six months out, we can'tsay precisely what we will endorse in June, much less what the voters willapprove. But it seems clear that to pass, any new tax will have to pay for aspecific one-time purpose, and self-destruct when that purpose is accomplished.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911201  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6P  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  687  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 1, 199100336092,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
