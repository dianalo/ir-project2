These fertilizers are synthetic compound fertilizerscontaining three elements produced in such a way that raw nitrogeneousand potash fertilizers are mixed with the phosphoric acid suspensionof fly ash and the mixture is granulated or moulded utilizing the spontaneoussetup caused by the gelation of silicic acid. The cultivation test of'Komatsuna', Brassica campestris L., using the fertilizers was made inaccordance with the 'Methods of Cultivation Test on Harm to Plants' inthe Fertilizer Control Law. The fertilization effect of applying a largequantity of the test specimen of high-analysis synthetic compound fertilizersutilizing fly ash was higher than that of the control fertilizer. Noharm to the growth by excessive application was observed. This is becausethe diffusion of salts from the test specimen is lower than that fromthe control fertilizer. These fertilizers meet, therefore, the requirementsof the Fertilizer Control Law. (4 figs, 7 tabs, 2 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
