KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush said today he is depending onthe Democratic chairman of the Armed Services Committee to helpprevent Congress from gutting a defense authorization bill alreadytorn asunder in House votes.   In two days of votes on a $295 billion defense authorizationbill, the House ignored White House and Pentagon lobbying andturned Bush's defense priorities on their head.   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed ServicesCommittee, said the House had ``shredded'' Bush's defensepriorities to produce ``a Michael Dukakis defense bill.''   Bush told a White House news conference he is disappointed atthe House votes cutting back virtually every major strategicprogram, but said that with the help of the Senate, ``we willprevail.''   ``I'm going to put a lot of emphasis on the Senate and we willwork with people like Chairman Aspin, who does not want to see thedefense bill gutted,'' Bush said.   ``And I do think we will prevail for most of what we want _ astrong SDI (Star Wars) program, a strong B-2 (stealth bomber)program,'' he said.   ``But I do not want to negotiate with the Soviet Union withoutas many cards in my hands as possible,'' he said.   Bush said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had made tough cuts indefense programs even before the House acted.   ``I want to get support across the board in the Congress for ourdefense program, and yesterday was not the House's most memorablemoment, but we're going to keep fighting on for what we believein,'' he said.   The House restored funds for conventional aircraft discarded bythe Pentagon while suspending most production of the radar-evadingstealth bomber. It cut money for the Star Wars missile defensesystem, stripped funds intended to make the MX missile a mobileweapon and eliminated all of the $100 million provided for theMidgetman missile.   The Senate, meanwhile, only narrowly turned aside a strong bidto freeze research and development of the Star Wars strategicdefense initiative. It tabled the amendment offered by Sen. BennettJohnston, D-La., 50-47.   But that action may result in the chamber retaining neededleverage to resist House cuts on that and other weapons systems.   The Senate will need all the leverage it can muster whenrepresentatives of the two bodies meet in conference to resolve themany differences between the two bills.   Senators are to continue their consideration of the measure nextweek.   ``We are watching the strategic position of the administrationunwind step by step on the floor of the House,'' said Sen. SamNunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.   ``It is important that we not emasculate this program,'' Nunnsaid as the vote neared on an amendment to cut Star Wars by $558million in addition to the $400 million trimmed earlier by theSenate panel.   ``If the Senate does not come out with a reasonable budget onall strategic programs, then we are going to be going to conferencein a hopeless situation,'' he said.   The House adopted its version of the bill, 261-162.   In the final minutes of debate, an unusual coalition ofRepublicans and liberals turned against the Midgetman.   Republicans were prompted by anger at an earlier vote cutting$502 million from the $1.1 billion the administration had asked forthe rail lines needed to make the MX a mobile and less vulnerableweapon. Joining them were many liberal members.   Aspin appealed to members not to reject Minuteman ``on a motionof spite.''   But on a head-count vote of 176-90 the House approved thechange, removing all the money for the single-warhead missile.   The House also revived money for the Navy's F-14D jet fighterand the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey vertical takeoff assaulttransport _ two programs Bush planned to eliminate as low priorityitems in a tight-money budget.   Summing up the result, Aspin told reporters that in effect,``Mike (Dukakis) won the election. No Midgetman. No rail MX ... Bigcuts in SDI, and slow up the B-2 (stealth) bomber.''   Dukakis, the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, was soundlydefeated by Bush in the 1988 presidential election after a campaignin which the Republican portrayed the Democrat as weak on defense.   As Aspin saw it, the Democratic majority which controls theHouse carried out the defeated candidate's campaign promises inwriting its version of the defense bill.   The House's military spending plan suspends production of theB-2 stealth bomber, priced at about $530 million each, until thePentagon scales back its $70 billion, 132-plane program, widelyviewed as unaffordable in an era of soaring budget deficits.   The bill also requires the administration to show that thestealth can successfully evade radar detection and penetrate Sovietairspace before production resumes.   Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had lobbied hard forstealth, Star Wars and the other strategic programs.   But the House slashed $1.8 billion from the president's $4.9billion Star Wars request.</TEXT></DOC>
