<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-41-0372 </DOCNO><TEXT>Research into passive and hybrid solar energy utilisation was conductedin semi-detached houses (positioned on a steep south-west facing slope).Each of the main storeys has an unheated, fully-glazed veranda porch.The report covers the project idea and development, (embedding the buildingin the earth, zoning, glazed veranda, optimation, insulation) using floorplan sketches and tables of specification data. Computer-aided parameterstudies (model, thermal insulation, quality of glazing, fresh air, bufferzones) follow, with construction hints on the design of the glass veranda(many sectional drawings, heat bridges) and the coverage of the remainingheat requirement (design + planning of electrical + heating installations,several alternatives). The architect's comments on the solar conceptand his correct zoning of the house conclude the article.(HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
