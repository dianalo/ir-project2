LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Students firebombed governmentbuildings and a U.S. military facility Friday, demanding thatofficials arrest former President Chun Doo-hwan and withdraw U.S.troops.   In an effort to defuse growing political instability, the rulingparty chairman met with Chun and asked him to respond to allegationsof corruption.   Yoon Giel-joong, chairman of the Democratic Justice Party, saidafter the three-hour meeting that Chun may make an open apology formisrule and act to allay public sentiment against him.   U.S. authorities said a dozen young people threw six firebombsinto the compound of a U.S. Army engineering installation in Seouland fled before police arrived. Windows were broken but no one washurt, they said.   In Seoul and elsewhere, radical students staged anti-Chundemonstrations and lobbed firebombs at a government party buildingand branch office of a U.S.-South Korea joint venture bank. Noinjuries or arrests were reported.   Five students demanding Chun's arrest seized a third-floor officein the Office of National Taxation in Seoul. It took police half anhour to overpower them.   Police said two students were injured slightly when they jumpedonto mattresses placed on the ground outside the government buildingto prevent suicides by the protesters.   In southern Kwangju city, 300 students hurling firebombs clashedwith riot police for more than two hours.   As part of their anti-government campaign, radical students arepressing for Chun's arrest for alleged corruption and human rightsviolations during his presidency, which ended in February.   The students' demand for the withdrawal of 42,000 U.S. troopsstationed in South Korea is part of their campaign against theUnited States. Several U.S. government buildings have been theirtargets recently.   On Thursday, more than 29,000 people took part in rallies orstreet protests against Chun, newspapers said.   Officials said about 380 people, mostly police, were injured andabout 100 protesters detained Thursday, a day of the worstanti-government protests in recent months.   Police fired 9,200 rounds of tear gas against 18,700 firebombs.Students attacked six government party offices, eight policesubstations and two government buildings, police said.   Police maintained tight security around Chun's house, wherestudents threatened to march Saturday.   Chun, who took power with military backing in 1980, has beenunder parliamentary investigation on various charges, including hisalleged role in putting down a 1980 civil uprising in Kwangju. Byofficial count, about 200 people died in the military crackdown, butdissidents put the number much higher.   Radicals also are demanding the overthrow of President RohTae-woo and claim his government is a front for military ruledespite the democratic reforms he has instituted.   The radical students have little public support, but areinfluential on college campuses.</TEXT></DOC>
