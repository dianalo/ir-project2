In the government-organized ceremony, vehicles carrying thousandsof soldiers bearing rifles rumbled out of this northwestern provinceafter a band played pop music. A commander waved flowers in the lead.   Vietnam says it is conducting a six-day withdrawal of its last26,000 troops from Siem Reap and several other areas of the country.But opposing guerrilla forces charge that Vietnam is faking thetroop movement and actually hiding and disguising its troops.   Vietnam invaded Cambodia on Christmas Day 1978 and within twoweeks toppled the fanatical Communist Khmer Rouge regime, installinga pro-Hanoi government in the capital of Phnom Penh.   During its four-year rule, the Khmer Rouge killed hundreds ofthousands of Cambodians as it tried at the point of a gun to turnthe country into an agrarian commune. It also launched bloodyattacks on the Vietnamese border.   At the height of its conflict with Cambodian guerrillas, Vietnamhad 200,000 men in the country, according to Vietnamese officers.   They say Hanoi began annual partial pullouts in 1982 and that55,300 Vietnamese died fighting the Cambodians, 25,000 of them in1977 and 1978.   The invasion also brought economic blockades by non-Communistcountries that kept Vietnam one of the world's poorest counties.   With the collapse of peace talks in Paris last month, the pulloutwould leave the Phnom Penh government fighting a coalition of up to50,000 guerrillas backed by China, Thailand and other countries.   Each side claims the other has received increased shipments ofarms in recent months.   Phnom Penh's Prime Minister Hun Sen returned home today aftertalks in Thailand on arranging a cease-fire and said it was now upto the guerrillas to agree to halt fighting.   Maj. Gen. Huol Savorn, commander of Cambodia's 4th Army Region,said he expected a major guerrilla offensive after the pullout ofthe some 10,000 soldiers of ``Front 479'' from Siem Reap, Battambangand Oddar Meanchey provinces. These malarial, jungled Thai borderprovinces are among those most strongly contested by the guerrillas.   ``They are going to fight a lot'' to try to occupy border areasbefore striking inland, he told reporters.   ``But they will not be able to achieve this,'' he said. ``Withthe equipment that they have, they can only carry out hit-and-runattacks. The main thing is they don't have enough food andequipment.''   He said the guerrillas were outnumbered three to one, and theyhad different aims and refused to cooperate with each other.   The Paris talks failed to agree on international monitoring ofthe troop movement, and the only official foreign observers seen inSiem Reap were from Vietnam and its close allies Laos, Cuba and theSoviet Union.   Of the absence of Western observers, Soviet delegate and ForeignMinistry official Genrich Kinreed said ``it was astonishing why theyinsisted (on international monitoring) but didn't come.'' Hisfour-member team was led by Suleimenov Oljas, member of the SupremeSoviet, or parliament.   A four-member team Soviet was led by Suleimenov Oljas, member ofthe Supreme Soviet, or the parliament.   About 50 journalists from non-Communist countries watched thetroop movement.   The Cambodians bade the soldiers farewell in a two-hour ceremonyon the rain-soaked gravel road outside a kindergarten built byVietnamese soldiers.   Banners expressing sadness at the troops' departure and hopes forcontinued Vietnamese-Cambodian ``solidarity'' were raised by groupsof students, soldiers, and schoolchildren wearing red kerchiefs _the ``young pioneers'' of the ruling Cambodian Communist Party. Theysweated under a hot sun.   On a wooden stage with the military officers, four Buddhist monksin flowing saffron robes chanted prayers for peace.   Cambodian and Vietnamese officials took turns with speeches thatdenounced Khmer Rouge ``genocide'' and claimed the guerrillas cannottake any territory.   Maj. Gen. Khieu Anh Lon, commander of Front 479, hugged aCambodian commander in front of a blue banner displaying thenational emblems of Vietnam's yellow star and Cambodia's Angkor Wattemple.   A young pioneer gave him her kerchief while three women intraditional costumes presented a bouquet of flowers.   The general walked down the muddied road where the army vehicleswere waiting, picked up a young boy, and climbed into hisweather-beaten U.S.-made jeep to begin the withdrawal.   The troops carried back bamboo mats, water jugs, guitars, evenyawning dogs and a monkey on their trucks, buses and armoredpersonnel carriers.   ``We are very happy to be leaving,'' said Maj. Duong Chu Viet,whose chest pocket was crowded with medals. ``We feel Cambodians candefend their own country.''   The soldiers, whose intervention sparked fighting that killedtens of thousands of people and split almost all Asia into twohostile camps, smiled and waved yellow and purple flowers as theydisappeared down the road.   At a press conference Wednesday in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, thedefense ministry's chief spokesman refused to rule out fightinganother war in Cambodia.   If the Khmer Rouge threatened the Phnom Penh government's ruleand asked Vietnam for assistance, the Vietnamese army ``would thenannounce its decision,'' said Maj. Gen. Nguyen Van Thai.</TEXT></DOC>
