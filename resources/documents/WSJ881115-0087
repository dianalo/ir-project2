Voters, realizing their insurance system was a mess, wanted to drive state officials into a corner and force them to come to grips with a problem they'd rather avoid. As the insurance system now starts breaking apart, the real cause of the problem should become apparent: It is the state's plaintiff lawyers, activist judges, &quot;consumer advocates&quot; and insurance regulators.    &quot;We consider it a big victory,&quot; says California Trial Lawyers Association President Gary Gwilliam. Ralph Nader, a big booster of Prop. 103, says: &quot;Now we're getting calls from other states and other groups interested in doing the same thing.&quot; Before any more states let Mr. Nader and his trial-lawyer friends do to them what they've just done for the people of California, they'd better watch closely the unfolding story of Prop. 103.    As written, it would slash all property and casualty insurance back to November 1987 rates, less 20%. Drivers with good records (80% of California's drivers) would get another 20% off. It would become a crime to cancel or refuse to sell policies under these new rules.    So far, the bill's voters aren't getting the rose garden that its Naderite sponsors promised. Insurance rates this week are rising, not falling. At least 40 insurers stopped writing policies, and others, such as Travelers and Fireman's Fund, are pulling out of the state auto-insurance market. Insurers are leaving the state before losses begin to accumulate at an estimated $4 billion a year. Under Prop. 103, the state insurance commissioner would allow increases from the rolled-back rates only if an insurer is otherwise &quot;substantially threatened with bankruptcy.&quot; (What this means, of course, is that people with more market-based insurance policies in other states will end up subsidizing the certain losses of their insurer's operations in California.)    All that's kept the remaining insurers in place is the belief that the courts will reject the confiscatory Prop. 103, which the state Supreme Court immediately stayed. Both the U.S. and California constitutions have provisions aimed at just this kind of assault: the takings clause (no property can be taken for a public purpose without the government paying compensation) and the contract clause (the government can't interfere with lawful contracts). The newly more conservative California Supreme Court will have to work out how much if any of the proposition is legal.    Surely it is no coincidence that auto rates are highest in states with the wildest tort systems: California, New Jersey and Massachusetts. These states have spent the past 30 years undermining traditional rules of liability, with the predictable result of higher premiums, state intrusion into the rate-setting process and eventually the kind of political gridlock and crisis that produced Prop. 103. (Allstate isn't waiting for a Nader-sponsored Prop. 103 in Massachusetts; it announced yesterday that it was pulling out of Massachusetts, where the state insurance commissioner sets rates.)    Led by the same Naderites who helped set off the litigation explosion in the first place, these states tried to wave away underlying actuarial pressures on premiums with the magic wand of state regulation. They dictated prices and terms and outlawed policies based on claims history or expectations in a liability-happy world. They made it hard to raise rates on unsafe drivers, forcing better drivers to bear the added burden. Compulsory assigned-risk plans to cover all drivers became actuarial disasters.    Prop. 103 is the latest sign that the tort and insurance regulation schemes need major overhauls. To borrow a famous phrase, the legal and regulatory system for cars in California is now unsafe at any speed. </TEXT></DOC>
