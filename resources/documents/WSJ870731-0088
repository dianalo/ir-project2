MillerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/31/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DIGSECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN><DATELINE> SAN FRANCISCO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Di Giorgio Corp. sued former suitor Gabelli Group Inc., alleging the New York investment firm and its affiliates violated securities laws in amassing a 28.6% Di Giorgio stake.    The suit, filed in U.S. district court here, says among other things that a Gabelli filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission contained material omissions as well as &quot;false and misleading statements.&quot;    Di Giorgio is a food distributor, with additional interests in building materials and real estate development. As previously reported, two partnerships affiliated with Gabelli Group last month disclosed in an SEC filing that they hold a 4.4% Di Giorgio stake. The filing also said that a Gabelli unit manages customer accounts holding additional Di Giorgio shares that boost the group's total stake to 28.6%. The managed shares were held for investment purposes, the filing said.    The partnerships made an unsolicited bid to take Di Giorgio private in a leveraged buyout, but the proposal, which the group valued at $28 a share, or about $238 million, was rebuffed.    In yesterday's complaint, Di Giorgio charged that the various Gabelli affiliates were acting as a group under SEC regulations. The group shielded its efforts to acquire a controlling block of Di Giorgio common, the suit alleges, by assigning the intent to acquire Di Giorgio to an affiliate whose beneficial ownership fell below the 5% reporting level.    Di Giorgio's suit asks the court to block from voting, or being counted as shares outstanding in a shareholder vote, all the shares the group acquired after its beneficial holdings allegedly crossed the 5% threshold.    An official for Gabelli Group declined comment, saying the company hadn't yet seen the suit.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Di Giorgio closed at $29.875, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
