The proposed law is ``revolutionary for Soviet society '' andconsidered by many to be nearly as radical as East Germany's recentliberalization of its exit rules, the official news agency said.   The bill allows emigration for virtually anyone who has entrypermission from another country and no outstanding alimonyobligations, criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets.   It sets a basic limit of five years on the length of time acitizen can be kept from emigrating because of access to secrets.   The bill, which was given preliminary approval by the SupremeSoviet legislature Monday, formalizes many changes that havealready been put into practice in Soviet emigration and travelpolicy. The procedures required to obtain travel documents andpermission to emigrate have already been eased tremendously in thelast two years, releasing a flood of visitors and emigrants acrossthe Soviet borders.   Soviet officials estimate 200,000 Soviets will have emigratedthis year and well over 2 million will have made visits abroad.Most of the emigrants go to the United States or West Germany.   Deputy Fyodor Burlatsky told the Supreme Soviet that currentpredictions hold the new law will allow more than 500,000 people toemigrate, and up to 8 million people will go abroad for visits nextyear, Tass said.   The officials acknowledge the main obstacles to travel havebecome the heavy workloads of emigration authorities, shortages ofplane and train tickets, and problems with currency exchange.   Supreme Soviet deputies said the visa-issuing agencies should beexpanded and more flights should be added, Tass reported.   The problem of where the financially strapped country will findhard currency to give its citizens to spend abroad will be moredifficult to resolve, the news agency added.   The rubles earned by Soviet citizens are non-convertible. Theyare generally not allowed across the borders and spurned in theWest.   Before the current liberalization of travel regulations, tens ofthousands of Jews and other Soviets were refused exit visas,becoming known as ``refuseniks.'' Their plight brought repeatedcensure from the West.   With less than 1 percent of applications to emigrate currentlybeing turned down, according to visa officials, few ``refuseniks''remain. The government says they are all held on the grounds thatthey had some access to secrets, but activists complain the secrecycriteria are abused and applied arbitrarily.</TEXT></DOC>
