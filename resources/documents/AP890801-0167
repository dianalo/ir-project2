Shevardnadze couldmake headway in that direction on a mission to Iran.   The immediate concern, U.S. and other diplomatic sources said,was Joseph J. Cicippio, a 58-year-old university comptroller, whoseexecution was threatened after the reported slaying of Marine Lt.Col. William R. Higgins. The deadline set by Cicippio's captors wasextended 48 hours.   Intrigued by the reprieve, U.S. officials left open thepossibility it was prompted by Iranian intervention.   Having no diplomatic ties to Iran, whose surrogates in Lebanonare believed to be holding eight Americans other than Higgins, theUnited States appealed to Saudi Arabia and other Arab governmentsas well as the Soviet Union for help.   During the day President Bush telephoned the Pope and TurkishPrime Minister Turgut Ozal and spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidBush's strategy was ``to stay alert to opportunities, be constantlyassessing the situation and talk to a lot of people, involve a lotof people'' to help the hostages.   In Israel, meanwhile, Ambassador William Brown held a fast-pacedseries of meetings with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, DefenseMinister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.   ``One of the aims is to find out what Israel plans to do,'' saida U.S. official. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he denied theUnited States was exerting pressure on Israel, whose abduction lastweek of Shiite Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid and two others promptedHiggins' captors to threaten to hang him unless the three were setfree.   Brown was under instruction from Washington to find out from theIsraeli government what further steps it planned to take in thedangerous hostage situation.   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said theUnited States had not asked Israel to release Obeid.   She cited U.S. policy against dealing with or making concessionsto terrorists.   ``No, we have not because you know our long-standing policy onhostages and Israel understands the U.S. policy on the matter ofhostages,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.   Referring to Israel's offer to trade the cleric and the twoothers to Hezbolloah for all foreign hostages, including threeIsraelis, Ms. Tutwiler again cited U.S. policy, which prohibitsdeals with hostage-takers.   ``Israel, as a sovereign nation, has a different policy,'' shesaid.   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas and others had urgedPresident Bush on Monday to seek ``some understanding with theIsraelis about future conduct that would endanger the lives ofAmericans.''   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, appeared toagree that Israel was operating at cross-purposes with the UnitedStates. He said it was ``fair to say that many people do share thesenator's concerns.''   But a senior U.S. official aboard the U.S. Air Force jet thatcarried Secretary of State James A. Baker III home Monday nightfrom a conference in Paris on Cambodia said Bush and Baker were``not criticizing Israel for what it did.''   The official, who demanded anonymity, said ``that's not theinterpretation'' to be given statements by Bush and Bakercriticizing kidnappings in general.   And Dole, in a speech Tuesday on the Senate floor, said, ``Aline has been drawn in the sand. It's not between the United Statesand its allies... between the United States and Israel. ... It is amuch clearer and more permanent line _ between those who practiceand profit from terrorism and those who are its victims.''   Arens, interviewed by CBS News Tuesday night, said, ``I don'tsee why anybody in the civilized world that is engaged in the fightagainst terrorism would now suggest that this murderer should nowbe released or that his apprehension was a mistake.''   Areans said, ``I think in retrospect we will see that we strucka very effective blow against terrorism.'' Also, he maintained ``Idon't think there is a wedge between Israel and the United States.''   In Stockholm, Sweden, the United States asked the Soviet UnionTuesday to use its influence with Iran to gain the release ofWestern hostages. John Kelly, assistant U.S. secretary of state,was meeting there with Nikolai Kozyrev, a Soviet official, on thesubject of Afghanistan.   ``We asked the Soviet Union to use its good offices to influencethe Iranian government to bring about their safe and immediaterelease,'' Kelly told reporters.   Shevardnadze was asked before Baker left Paris to use hisinfluence with the Iranians in behalf of the hostages, all of whomare believed held by pro-Iranian factions. Other U.S. diplomatsmade similar appeals to Soviet officials.   The Soviets are improving relations with Iran after the death ofthe Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The United States has beenconcerned about Soviet willingness to provide military assistanceto Iran and stressed freedom for all foreign hostages should takepriority.   A diplomatic source said Israeli officials in their talks withAmbassador Brown were sharing information about the militant Partyof God of which Obeid is a senior leader.   Israel has offered to release the cleric and the two others ifall foreign hostages are freed. ``The offer still stands,'' saidthe source, declining to be identified.   Asked if the Bush administration was pressuring Israel torelease Obeid or to take some other action, he said ``there is nosuch thing.''   If Higgins was executed _ and U.S. officials viewed thevideotape of his reported hanging __ there is no certainty withinthe administration when he was slain. That he might have beenexecuted weeks or even months ago is one reason U.S. officials arereluctant to conclude the Israeli abduction of Obeid sealed hisfate.   Meanwhile, the Israeli embassy issued a seven-point statementdefending its counter-terrorism policy and registering ``shock andhorror'' about the Higgins situation.   ``In our ongoing struggle against terrorism, we have found theHezbollah to be a most bloody, deceitful and extremist terrororganization,'' the statement said. ``So far, they have killedabout 300 Americans, more than 70 Frenchmen and dozens of Israelis.If it were not for the vigilance of the Israeli Defense Force,which has repeatedly thwarted their terrorist incursions, many moreinnocent lives would have been lost.''</TEXT></DOC>
