FRAZIER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Younger people with limited educations are morelikely than anyone to light up and should be the target ofcampaigns against cigarettes, a study released by the federalCenters for Disease Control concluded.   A 1988 survey of about 20,000 people in 36 states and theDistrict of Columbia found that less-educated people, who also tendto be of a lower social and economic status, are more likely to besmokers.   ``There has been progress in reducing cigarette smoking. But thestudy shows most of the progress is limited to the well-educated,''said Dr. Luis Escobedo of the Atlanta-based CDC, who analyzedaspects of the survey released Thursday.   ``The emphasis must become more targeted,'' he said. ``Some ofthat already is being done through substance abuse programs.Tobacco is an addictive substance.''   Escobedo said the National Cancer Institute has a program ininner-city schools working to reduce the odds of children becomingregular smokers, as do private institutes and some state healthdepartments.   The random telephone survey sought people 18 or older.   Results showed that for people older than 35 the likelihood ofbeing a current smoker increased with each decrease in the level ofeducation.   But for those ages 18 to 34, the chance of being a currentsmoker decreased substantially only for those with more than a highschool education, while smoking rates for high school dropouts andthose with high school diplomas were more nearly equal.   The study said cultural factors, such as the high Mormonpopulation in Utah, also may affect who smokes. Utah had the lowestrate of smokers in its over-18 population (18.1 percent) and formersmokers (9.1 percent).   Kentucky had the highest percentage of current smokers (37.9percent). The highest percentage of former smokers was in Maine(20.3 percent).   The median figure for current smokers was 26.2 percent, meaninghalf the states were above that figure and half below. The medianfigure for former smokers was 15.1 percent.   The study said other factors affecting who smokes includesmoking prevention activities such as school programs, statecigarette taxes and the intensity of promotional events andadvertising by the tobacco industry.   The study found that 41 percent of the 18-to-34 group with lessthan a high school education are smokers. The figure dropped toabout 34 percent for those with a high school education and 19percent to those with more than a high school education.   In older age groups the education difference between smokers andnon-smokers was much less pronounced.   The survey is part of a continuing study done annually since1980 with more states participating each year.</TEXT></DOC>
