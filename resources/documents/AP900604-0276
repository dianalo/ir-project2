Arguments that the tax interferes unduly with interstate commerceand violates equal protection rights were rejected by the courtwithout comment.   In other action, the court:   _Agreed to study the government's power to lift price controls onsome natural gas, a case that has tens of millions of dollars atstake for consumers. The federal regulations were struck down by afederal appeals court but will remain in effect until a SupremeCourt decision is announced, likely in 1991.   _Strengthened the government's power to keep the taxes withheldfrom businesses about to declare bankruptcy. Voting 9-0, thejustices ruled that the trustee of bankrupt American InternationalAirways is not entitled to recover $700,000 in taxes paid to theInternal Revenue Service.   _Ordered a lower court to reconsider a ruling that exempted theNuclear Regulatory Commission from collective bargaining with itsemployees over salaries. The justices said the lower court shouldrestudy the case in light of a high court ruling May 29 that theArmy must bargain with unions over wages and fringe benefits paid tocivilian teachers at Army-run schools for the children of militaryand civilian personnel.   _Ruled that nuclear industry ``whistleblowers'' who say they weredisciplined for complaining about lax safety may sue their employersunder state personal injury laws. The court unanimously said suchlawsuits are not pre-empted by a federal law protectingwhistleblowers.   _Agreed to decide whether passengers on international flights maysue airlines for emotional distress allegedly suffered innear-crashes that cause them no physical harm. The court said itwill review a ruling that Eastern Airlines may be forced to paypassengers on a flight that landed safely in Miami after all theplane's engines failed briefly in the air.   In the Alabama tax case, the state Supreme Court had concludedthat the tax was valid while acknowledging that it was more onerousfor out-of-state businesses.   ``There is no unconstitutional unequal treatment of foreigncorporations and no unconstitutional discrimination against them,''the state court ruled last Dec. 21.   The tax was challenged by Detroit-based General Motors Corp. andits subsidiaries and by Reynolds Metals Co., which is based inRichmond, Va.   Alabama imposes a franchise tax on all business conducted in thestate. Companies based outside the state pay a tax of $3 for every$1,000 worth of capital in the state. In-state companies pay $10 forevery $1,000 worth of all outstanding stock.   Lawyers for GM and Reynolds Metals told the justices that the twomethods of calculating the tax result in enormously higher taxes forout-of-state businesses.   ``The reason ... is that while the amount of business activityconducted and total capital employed in Alabama means everything indetermining the foreign corporation's tax liability,'' GM's appealsaid, ``business activity and total capital employed mean nothing indetermining the domestic corporation's liability.''   For 1982 and 1983, Alabama collected $94 million in franchisetaxes from out-of-state businesses based on 28,792 tax returns andless than $10 million from in-state businesses based on 81,698returns.   Adjustments to the tax law took effect in 1984 but that yearout-of-state businesses paid $49.6 million in franchise taxes andin-state businesses paid $14.7 million.   Reynolds Metals paid about $1.2 million in franchise taxes for1982 and 1983, the years for which it sued for refunds.   GM sued over the years 1983 through 1988, in which it paid $6.3million in Alabama franchise taxes.   The two appeals were supported by the State Tax Council of theState Chambers of Commerce and an organization called the TaxExecutives Institute.   ``The broad implication of the (state) court's holding is that... discrimination against out-of-state taxpayers will betolerated,'' lawyers for the Chamber of Commerce's council said.``If interstate business is to be protected from discriminatorystate taxes, the decision of the Alabama Supreme Court must bereviewed.''</TEXT></DOC>
