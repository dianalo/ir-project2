Asbestos-fiber concentrations rose from a pre-removallevel of 0.001 fibers per cubic centimeter (f/cc) to 0.010 f/cc duringpreparation of the pipe lagging for removal and 0.528f/cc during actualremoval in glove bags. Workers used respiratory protection and were probablyprotected from excessive amounts of asbestos. After work was completed,a comparison of aggressive and nonaggressive sampling was made. Of 12samples taken by the nonaggressive method, all were below the 10,000fibers per cubic meter (f/m{sup 3}) Environmental Protection Agency criterion.All of six post-removal samples taken in the lunchroom by the aggressivemethod were above the 10,000f/m{sup 3} limit. Good work practices observedincluded premisting lagging with amended water, wrapping pipe with plasticprior to starting removal work, use of a properly designed bag, startingwith a clean empty bag at pipe interfaces, making cuts on preformed laggingblocks at joints to minimize fiber generation, using long hoses on amendedwater sprayers to optimize wetting practices, frequent spraying, useof high-efficiency particulate air vacuum to contain fibers and assistin collapsing the glove bag during removal, and removal of contaminatedtools in an inverted glove for transfer to the next glove bag.</TEXT></DOC>
