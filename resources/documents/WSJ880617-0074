The composite index yesterday slipped 1.98 to 387.10 after six days of steady gains in which it set a post-crash high. There was more profit-taking done on the New York Stock Exchange than on Nasdaq, however, and while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7% yesterday, Nasdaq's biggest industrials held up better. The Nasdaq 100 index slipped 3.20 to 369.01, less than 1%.    Also, although losing securities beat winners 1,212 to 891, OTC stocks continued a bullish trend recently in which there have been significantly more 52-week highs set than 52-week lows. Yesterday there were 135 new highs, 40 new lows.    Nasdaq volume checked in at a busy 146 million shares; if today's trading pace is similar, the week will be one of the busiest of the past two dull months on Nasdaq.    Publicity about the Farm Belt's drought was good to Pioneer Hi-Bred International again. Stock in the big Des Moines, Iowa, seed maker rose 1 3/4 to 36 1/4. It was trading at 31 early in the month. The company has commented in the past, however, that while a drought might allow it to sell more seeds, it might also raise its production costs.    Meanwhile, seed producer DeKalb Corp. watched its stock jump 1 1/8 to 33 1/8 and stock in Valmont Industries, which makes irrigation equipment, added 1 to 40. Intel, Nasdaq's biggest stock, with market value of nearly $6 billion, added 1/8 to 35 1/4 on about 2.8 million shares. The Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor concern introduced a new microchip that might make for cheaper personal computers. Another huge Nasdaq technology stock, Apple Computer, fell 1 1/4 to 44 1/2.    Among some other active stocks, the volatile LyphoMed lost 1 to 10 1/2; SHL Systemhouse lost 1/8 to 8 5/8; and Cherokee Group added 7/8 to 12 1/2.    Farmers Group rose 7/8 to 61 3/8 on more than 1.1 million shares. Today, California insurance regulators will rule on a bid for the Los Angeles insurance holding company by B.A.T Industries PLC. A decision is likely to favor B.A.T.    On the St. Louis OTC bank scene, Centerre Bancorp rose 1 1/4 to 54, responding to a $60-a-share takeover agreement announced after the market closed Wednesday by Boatmen's Bancshares. Boatmen's fell 2 to 31 3/4. Shares in Mercantile Bancorp, which earlier agreed to buy Centerre, added 2 to 26 3/4.    Isomedix jumped 1 1/8 to 8 1/2. The Whippany, N.J., radiation-sterilization company, with market value of about $45 million, received an unsolicited $7.50-a-share takeover offer from Charles King andamp; Associates, a closely held limited partnership. Isomedix called the offer &quot;grossly inadequate.&quot; Isomedix also said 1988 net income will top 50 cents a share, compared with 12 cents last year.    Seven Oaks International fell 3/4 to 5 7/8. The Memphis, Tenn., clearinghouse for cents-off coupons omitted its quarterly common stock dividend of 4.5 cents a share.    Patlex, which rose 1 1/2 to 13 Wednesday on news that the laser-patent licensing firm would spin off its manufacturing operations, gave back 1/2 yesterday to end at 12 1/2. </TEXT></DOC>
