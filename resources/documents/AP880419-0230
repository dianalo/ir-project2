It may be one of those times now.   Believing in the theory is one thing, but believing in itstrongly enough to make a basic investment change is a matter of avastly different magnitude, since commissions and steep capitalgains taxes could be involved.   Still, since the theory seems to make sense, the temptation isthere.   When interest rates rise, the returns from bonds becomerelatively more attractive. As investors shift, the prices ofstocks tend to become depressed. And as rates rise, corporateearnings may fall, depressing stocks further.   Gerald Perritt, a former DePaul University professor and currentpresident and editor of the newsletter Investment Horizons, isamong those who wondered if reality performed according to theory,and so he put the theory to the test.   Using changes in the prime interest rate as a guide _ it was anarbitrary decision; others measures could have been used _ hetraced the stock market's reactions from March 25, 1970.   For experimental purposes, he assumed that on that date a 100percent commitment was made to the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stockindex and maintained until May 11, 1971, when the prime rate roseto 5.5 percent from 5.25 percent.   The commitment was then sold, and no stock investments were madeuntil October 20, 1971, when the prime rate fell to 5.75 percentfrom 6 percent.   Thereafter, he sold when the prime rose and bought when it fell.   The result: A 462 percent gain in value, dividends excluded,which is more than double the 196 percent capital appreciationearned on a buy-and-hold strategy employed over the entire period.   He concludes: ``Even if commissions and income taxes areaccounted for, the prime rate portfolio readjustment strategyyields a significantly higher overall rate of return relative toimplementation of a buy-and-hold strategy.''   But the story doesn't end there. In fact, a very big questionarises: What might have happened if you weren't able to hold theportfolio intact for that long period of time? What if you hadneeded to cash in?   Answer: You might not have done very well, since the strategywould not have yielded the best results on all occasions.   In fact, says Perritt, there were five periods when the strategywould have placed the investor in the stock market during times ofdeclining stock prices.   Similarly, on six occasions the strategy would have resulted inthe investor sitting on the sidelines during periods of risingstock prices.   Question: Would you, or most other investors, have been able tofollow a strategy that failed to work on so many occasions,confident that over longer periods of time it would work out forthe best?   Perritt concedes it would have taken extreme patience forinvestors to have followed the theory, one of the reasons being itwould have kept them on the sidelines for periods as long as 25months.   And, he acknowledges, the one investment axiom that has longstood the test of time is ``whatever has worked well in the pastwill most likely not work continuously in the future.''   Nevertheless, he expresses the opinion that ``history oftencontains lessons which, if learned and practiced, can improve one'swell-being.''   This, he believes, is the case with the historical relationshipbetween interest rates and stock market prices.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Wednesday, April 20.</NOTE></DOC>
