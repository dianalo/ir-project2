<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-31-1326 </DOCNO><TEXT>The intrinsic rate constant for the rate of reaction of SO/sub 2/ withporous CaO in an excess of O/sub 2/ to form CaSO/sub 4/ has been determinedfrom SO/sub 2/ sorption data on a wide range of particle diameters (1{mu}m-1mm),SO/sub 2/ partial pressures (60 Pa to 5 kPa), and temperatures (973-1,478K).An intrinsic SO/sub 2/ reaction order of unity has been validated throughcurrent fixed-bed experiments in the 60 to 300 Pa SO/sub 2/ partial pressurerange, while fluidized-bed data were used to validate the reaction orderfrom 500 Pa to 5 kPa SO/sub 2/ partial pressure. The absolute value ofthe rate constant and the activation energy was derived from data onsmall (1 {mu}m) particles, which approach the limit of kinetic control.While analysis of this data base dose minimize the role of intraparticlediffusion through the porous sorbent particle, the filling of the smallpores by the product deposits and the associated loss of internal surfacearea is critical to the data reduction. It is believed that the intrinsicrate constant is known to the accuracy to which the reactivity and theBET surface area may be measured.</TEXT></DOC>
