Joseph R. Biden Jr.,D-Del., said Monday as the Senate began to debate the proposedamendment.   Biden said it would allow authorities to ignore ``a well keptbusinessman in a three-piece, Brooks Brothers suit who burned theflag'' while jailing ``a college dropout with long hair and tornjeans who burned the flag.''   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said dissent would not be stifledby a limit on such protest and called for support ``as we seek toprotect our most cherished symbol of democracy from contemptuousdesecration.''   The measure would authorize federal and state governments tooutlaw burning and other desecration of the flag.   The Senate confined itself to debating the measure Tuesday andaimed for a vote later this week. The House would vote on theamendment after that.   Even if approved by Congress, it would have to be passed by thelegislatures of 38 states before becoming part of the Constitution.   Lawmakers sent to President Bush on Thursday a rival measurethat would ban burning or other desecration by simple statute.   Sponsors of the amendment, however, say the statutory ban couldbe ruled unconstitutional on the same grounds as the Texas lawthrown out by the Supreme Court this summer in overturning theconviction of flag burner Gregory Lee Johnson.   ``I remain convinced that the bill that passed the Congress lastweek will not survive constitutional scrutiny in light of theJohnson decision,'' said Thurmond. He said there were many ways toexpress dissent other than burning flags and ``those avenues shouldand will go unimpeded.''   The bill already sent to Bush was designed to avoid theconstitutional question by simply barring flag desecrationregardless of whether it involved political protest.   Thse who are opposing the amendment say it would amount totampering with the Constitution for political reasons.   ``What are we going to remember more, the Constitution or amomentary political poll?'' Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., asked theSenate.   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said lawmakers were being askedto amend the Bill of Rights ``partly because of concern over theobnoxious act of a protester who burned the flag but largelybecause of an unseemly effort to gain partisan political advantagefrom the incident.''   He said the Texas protester ``committed a despicable act.'' Buthe noted President Bush initially seemed to accept the SupremeCourt's decision in the case and only launched a campaign for anamendment after having lunch with GOP national Chairman Lee Atwater.   ``The Atwater-Bush amendment will do more violence to theConstitution than Gregory Lee Johnson could possibly have hoped toaccomplish with his puny act of protest,'' Kennedy said.   Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., said the Supreme Court ruling was``a wrongheaded decision'' and said the amendment is needed as``the surest protection against further acts of desecration.''   ``It's the only effective way to protect our cherished flag,''Dixon said.</TEXT></DOC>
