Saddam Hussein has threatened to devastate the kingdom's mainoilfields in the northeastern desert if the U.S.-dominatedmultinational force in Saudi Arabia launches an offensive toliberate occupied Kuwait.   Saudi officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it wasonly the fear of war - not any actual shortage in the market - thatdrove the price of a barrel of oil up from $16 before the crisis toits current $34.   But former Saudi Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani and other Saudisources said the fundamentals of the market do not justify an oilprice much above $20 a barrel - let alone the $40 a barrel touchedrecently.   Yamani said that if Iraq pulls out of Kuwait peacefully andIraqi and Kuwaiti production is rapidly restored, the price islikely to drop even more steeply, perhaps to well below $15 abarrel, because of doubts about OPEC's ability to cut productionpromptly.   Saudi officials are confident that if Saddam attacked, he wouldonly be able to inflict minimal damage with his missiles and attackjets.   ``Our defenses at the oilfields are good and the industry by itsvery structure is very widely dispersed,'' said one Saudi source,speaking on condition of anonymity.   He noted that throughout the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, theIranians never stopped using their Kharg Island offshore oilterminal despite its proximity to Iraq and almost daily air raids.   The Saudis have already raised their oil output to 8.2 millionbarrels a day, a 10-year high and a 57 percent increase since Iraqinvaded Kuwait Aug. 2.   This, along with increases by other producers in the 13-memberOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has made up for theshortfall of 4 million barrels a day caused by the U.N.-imposedembargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.   The Saudis are not even able to sell all of the oil they areproducing now because customers are not buying up all of theinferior grades, petroleum experts say.   But a New York analyst said Friday it makes sense for them tohave the capacity to pump 10 million barrels a day so they couldtry to control future price spikes or supply problems with quickjumps in production.   ``They don't want to see a situation where the supply would bedisrupted,'' said Philip Dodge of Nomura Securities InternationalInc. ``They'd like to be able to drive the price back to $20 today,but they don't have the capacity to do it, and they don't want tofind themselves in that situation again.''   The Saudis, who fear high oil prices will cut back demand, aretrying to calm world oil markets by telling reporters about thepossibility that they could speed up the expansion, another analystsaid.   ``What they say and what they achieve could be two differentthings,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst withShearson Lehman Brothers Inc.   Saudi Arabia has about 255 billion barrels of proven reserves,the largest in the world, equal to the combined reserves of theUnited States, Soviet Union, China, Mexico and Venezuela.   Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said last week that output could reach8.5 million barrels a day by the end of the year. An expansion plandrawn up before the crisis aimed for 10 million barrels a day by1995.   Although officials stress that no decision has been taken yet toimplement the plan, the Saudis are considering accelerating it with1992 as a possible target date.   Saudi authorities have announced at least six oil and gasdiscoveries over the past year in a previously unexploited desertregion between 45 miles and 125 miles south of Riyadh, the capital.   The fields are well-placed strategically, with the nearest morethan 310 miles from the Kuwaiti border, unlike the existingfacilities in the Eastern Province.   Nazer has refused to cite specific figures for the extent of thenew reserves. He says the area is still under exploration.   But a Western oil analyst said ``informed speculation'' was thatthe area could contain up to 30 billion barrels of oil.   Sydney Bowers, a geological consultant for Saudi ARAMCO, said itwas too early to provide figures, and analysts stressed it wouldtake years and major investments on infrastructure to bring thefields on stream.   Saudi officials express confidence that any war in the regionwould lead to only a brief surge in oil prices, followed by a sharpdrop within a matter of days.</TEXT></DOC>
