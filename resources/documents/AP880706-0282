Inc. anestimated 33 percent local market share.   Sun, the nation's 10th-largest petroleum producer, announcedTuesday it planned to purchase Atlantic Refining and MarketingCorp. for $513 million.   Sun said the acquisition would help meet its needs for increasedrefining flexibility.   Sun, which markets Sunoco gasoline, operates in 27 states.Atlantic operates in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey.Atlantic reportedly has 20 percent of the market share in thePhiladelphia area, while Sun has about 13 percent.   Tom Anderson, executive director of the Pennsylvania GasolineDealers Associations, said consumers should be concerned by theacquisition.   ``Another level of competition has been eliminated,'' he said.``It's going to increase the price because Atlantic was thecheapest on the street.''   The purchase is subject to approval by the Federal TradeCommission and the U.S. Justice Department.   Part of the deal includes a Philadelphia refinery that has adaily capacity of 135,000 barrels of crude oil and a 986-milepipeline that runs from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh in Pennsylvaniaand to Rochester and Tonawanda, N.Y.   Sun chairman Robert McClements Jr. said the company willpurchase all shares of Atlantic Petroleum Maatschappij BV, aNetherlands holding company owned by John Duess.   Duess bought the Atlantic properties from Atlantic Richfield Co.of Los Angeles in 1985 for $420 million when it decided to pull outof the region.   ``Atlantic is a well-run and well-managed company,'' Sunspokesman Kenneth Huffman said. He also said Atlantic wouldcontinue using its present logo.   Sun would pay for all Atlantic's inventory, including crude oiland finished products and working capital.   Huffman said a major part of the deal was the acquisition of thePhiladelphia refinery, which, unlike Sun's suburban Marcus Hookfacility, can process crude oil classified as high-sulphur andheavy. Sun's refinery can handle only so-called lighter crude.   ``This acquisition is consistent with our objective ofstrengthening the company's position in refining and marketing,''said McClements.   Sun presently owns four refineries with a processing capacity of460,000 barrels of crude oil daily, plus 6,000 Sunoco stations in27 states in the eastern half of the U.S.   The Atlantic refinery, whose 440 employees handled 130,000barrels a day, would help Sun meet its daily sales demand of700,000 barrels. In the past Sun has purchased from outside sources.   Atlantic also has 571 company-owned stations and supples another400 independent stations.   Besides Marcus Hook, Sun has refineries in Toledo, Ohio; Tulsa,Okla.; and Yabucoa, Puerto Rico.</TEXT></DOC>
