Er/sup3+/ion parametric relaxation is detected to be inhibited by the phononneck effect. The effect of resonance attenuation of the phonon neck isdetected in two-phonon resonance processes of Er/sup 3+/ ion relaxation.The Debye crystal temperature is determined from the experimental resultanalysis.</TEXT></DOC>
