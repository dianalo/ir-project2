The A-12 may yet get built, but its prospects dimmed greatlylast Friday when Cheney told Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrettthat he would cancel the $50 billion project on Jan. 4 unless theNavy could ``show cause'' why it should be salvaged.   ``The A-12 program is in serious trouble,'' Cheney wrote in amemorandum to Garrett. ``The apparent schedule slippages, costgrowth and management deficiencies in this program are intolerable.If we cannot spend the taxpayers' money wisely, we will not spendit.''   Cheney's blunt words underscore how far the A-12's fortunes havefallen this year.   Less than eight months ago Cheney was telling Congress that ahigh-level Pentagon review had given the A-12 a clean bill ofhealth and that the Navy was on track to begin fielding the firstof 620 A-12s on schedule and within budget.   A few weeks later the contractors - McDonnell Douglas Corp. andGeneral Dynamics Corp. - disclosed that they were far behindschedule and far above budget. They also raised doubts about theirability to build the plane to specifications.   Two weeks ago, an internal Navy report on the A-12 programconcluded that the contractors and Navy managers failed to fullyadvise top Pentagon officials of cost overruns and the likelihoodof delays in building the prototypes. In response, Garrett sackedthe three-star admiral in charge of Navy aviation programs, and hereprimanded two other uniformed officers involved.   The A-12 episode is all the more remarkable for the nationalsecurity interests at stake.   The Navy has no known alternative to the new aircraft, calledthe Avenger, which has been scheduled to begin replacing the A-6Intruder attack plane in the mid-1990s and to serve as the maincarrier-based bomber well into the 21st century.   Cheney alluded to this in his note to Garrett.   ``We will continue to need to develop a basic strike airplanefor our aircraft carrier force,'' Cheney wrote, because the A-6fleet is too old, too slow and lacks the technology ``necessary tomaintain U.S. naval air superiority.''   The A-6s, some of which currently are deployed in the PersianGulf crisis, have been in service for nearly 30 years. The aircraftwas used, along with Air Force F-111 fighter-bombers, in the April1986 American bombing raid on Libya.   Little is known about the capabilities of the A-12 Avengerbecause it is highly classified.   Cheney, in his memo to Garrett, seemed to be indicating that theAvenger must go ahead, but that he wants a major shakeup in theproject's management. One possible outcome is that the $4.8 billionMcDonnell Douglas-General Dynamics contract for building Avengerprototypes would be rewritten to give the companies more time toovercome the technical problems they have encountered.   That probably would mean the Avenger would not enter serviceuntil late in this decade, or possibly later.   It also is possible that the Pentagon will decide to buy farfewer of the planes than the 620 now planned. Fewer may be neededif, as seems likely, the aircraft carrier fleet is reduced from thecurrent 14 in response to budget pressures and the end of the ColdWar.   McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics are expected to formallyask the Pentagon soon to restructure the Avenger contract toaccount for unanticipated costs.</TEXT></DOC>
