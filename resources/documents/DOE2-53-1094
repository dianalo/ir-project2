The impetus to use QSAR methods in this area hasbeen the large number of synthetic chemicals introduced into the ecosystemvia intensive agriculture and industrialization. Because of the costlyand time-consuming nature of environmental fate testing, QSARs have beeneffectively used to screen large classes of chemical compounds and flagthose that appear to warrant more thorough testing.</TEXT></DOC>
