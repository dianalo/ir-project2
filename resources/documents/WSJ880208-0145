The fact is that USX Corp.'s prices are still struggling to even approach the price levels of the early 1980s. Our average transaction prices for prime products at year-end 1987 were $135 a ton below those we were receiving in 1981 and 1982 -- a decline of more than 23%. In some product lines, we are getting about 30% less than the 1981-1982 levels. How many other businesses are selling their products for three-quarters the price received five years ago? These facts hardly describe an unjustifiably high steel price structure.    The VRA program has been an effective means of addressing the steel trade problem. At the same time, domestic steelmakers have made impressive progress in restructuring their operations and becoming more efficient competitors. However, an extension of the restraint agreements would help the industry finish that task and thereby afford the industry the opportunity to return to some consistent level of profitability. The modest profitability of 1987 does not cure the 25-year-old steel trade problem.    William H. Hoffman Jr.    General Manager, Public Affairs   USX Corp.    Pittsburgh</TEXT></DOC>
