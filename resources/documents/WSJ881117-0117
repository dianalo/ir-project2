But to the Israelis, the PNC's achievement is extremely worrying. In their view, a terrorist organization bent on Israel's destruction has duped gullible outsiders.    &quot;Our main problem is that the world media is understanding the outcome of the PNC as recognition of Israel,&quot; says Alon Liel, spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry. &quot;Public opinion is already quite formed about it.&quot;    The Palestine National Council, a 450-member body representing Palestinian political factions and professional organizations, decides policy for the Palestine Liberation Organization.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has called for a &quot;political war&quot; to counter the impression that the PLO has significantly changed its policy. The government already has produced a blizzard of material contending that the PNC's acceptance of United Nations resolutions 242 and 338 doesn't constitute recognition of the Jewish state. It dispatched a position paper to all foreign embassies, hoping to forestall any more moves such as Turkey's recognition of the independent state of Palestine, proclaimed Tuesday in Algiers.    While many Arab and Moslem governments have, as expected, recognized the national state, Turkey is the first state with diplomatic relations with Israel to do so. Egypt, which also has diplomatic ties with Israel, welcomed the Palestinian state without recognizing it.    Israel and the U.S. have long called on the Palestinians to accept resolutions 242 and 338, which call for Israeli withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967, in return for the right of all states in the region to live peacefully with secure borders. But by tying their recognition of 242 to &quot;all other U.N. resolutions&quot; and to the acceptance of Palestinian self-determination, the Israeli government argues, the Palestinians made resolution 242 moot.    The government says other U.N. resolutions, by calling for sanctions and severing of all ties with Israel, equating Zionism with racism and stressing the right of Palestinians to return to their homes, seek to delegitimize Israel's right to exist. It also says that &quot;self-determination&quot; in Palestinian jargon has traditionally meant determining the right of the Palestinian people to all of Israel.    Palestinians are depressed by the Israeli reaction. &quot;For years, Israelis have said they wanted to see {PLO Chairman} Yasser Arafat personally say these words&quot; accepting Resolution 242, says Mahdi Abdul-Hadi, director of the Palestine Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs in Jerusalem. &quot;We are offering now to free them from their nightmares of security -- we don't want to destroy Israel, we want to coexist. I know they don't want to see it, or read it, but it's there.&quot;    Some Israelis also are disappointed by the government's reaction. &quot;The right wing, and to a lesser extent, the Foreign Ministry, are relieved that it isn't recognition,&quot; says Daniel Seidman, a lawyer and spokesman for Peace Now, the largest Israeli peace group. &quot;Israel should toss down the gauntlet and say, 'Let's see exactly what you mean. We'll talk to the PLO if you quit hemming and hawing and say you'll accept a two-state solution achieved through political means.' The PLO just took half a step in the right direction. We need another step and a half, but instead of forcing them to take it, we're letting them off the hook,&quot; he says.    Even the Foreign Ministry's Mr. Liel acknowledges that the fact the PLO &quot;even mentioned&quot; resolutions 242 and 338, which it has previously refused to do, is &quot;a positive element&quot; that makes the Palestinians seem constructive and flexible, compared to recent Israeli rigidity.    And in contrast to the consensus the Palestinians were able to muster by winning the acquiescence of even their hardliners, the Israelis appear hopelessly divided as they try to cobble together a government after inconclusive elections.    &quot;We realize it is putting us in a difficult position,&quot; Mr. Liel says. &quot;The PLO has definitely gained some points.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
