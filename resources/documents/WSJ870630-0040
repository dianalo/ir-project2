Garcia</HL><DD> 06/30/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices moved mostly higher yesterday, led by oil issues and helped by a firmer dollar.    But the gains were concentrated in a narrow group of stocks, primarily blue-chip issues such as the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues were outnumbered by decliners.    Gains in Exxon; Chevron; USX, which owns Marathon Oil and Texas Oil and Gas; and Du Pont, which owns Conoco; contributed to the 10.05-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed at 2446.91. The interest in oil stocks and in the shares of other companies tied to the oil industry came amid investor and analyst expectations that crude oil prices may climb above the current $18 a barrel in the next few months.    The broader market indexes lagged the industrial average. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.74 to 307.90, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index moved up 0.32 to 172.99.    Volume on the Big Board contracted to 142.5 million shares from 150.5 million shares Friday, as 822 issues declined and 713 issues advanced.    &quot;It's a good looking market, but it's also a more limited market. It's not what we saw in the first quarter,&quot; said Larry Wachtel, a market strategist with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. He was referring to the broad rally in the first three months of the year, which sent blue-chips as well as secondary issues, such as those traded in the over-the-counter market, up substantially.    Yesterday, the Nasdaq OTC composite index fell 0.20 to 426.48. Volume in the OTC market narrowed to 123.2 million shares from 145.7 million shares Friday.    Joseph Barthel, a technical analyst with Butcher andamp; Singer in Philadelphia, said this &quot;split market,&quot; where blue-chip stocks go on posting highs while the rest of the market falls behind, can continue for some time. He noted that in 1983, such a market lasted for a little more than six months -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke away from the secondary market in June and reached its peak in January 1984. The overall stock market had a steep slide after the industrial average peaked, he added.    Mr. Barthel believes this could happen again. The number of advancing stocks in each session began to contract in April, but blue-chips have continued to rally. He expects the industrial average to advance through the summer, until money managers use up the cash in their portfolios. But in the long run, this kind of market &quot;is going to provide you with a sizable break on the downside,&quot; he said.    Oil stocks rallied following news of a compromise agreement coming out of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in Vienna, Austria. The agreement is expected to push up crude oil prices over the next few months beyond the current $18 a barrel.    Exxon rose 2 1/8 to 93 5/8, Phillips Petroleum gained 3/8 to 16 1/2, Atlantic Richfield moved up 1 3/4 to 95 3/4, Chevron advanced 1 5/8 to 61 7/8, Amerada Hess added 2 1/8 to 38 3/4, Royal Dutch gained 3 1/4 to 132 1/2, Shell Transport andamp; Trading rose 1 5/8 to 91 7/8 and British Petroleum added 1 3/8 to 74 5/8.    The good news for oil producers turned out to be less-than-welcome news for companies that are big energy users, such as airlines and truckers. The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 0.29 to 1029.50.    Among airlines, Allegis fell 3/8 to 89 1/8, Delta Air Lines lost 1/4 to 56 3/4. But NWA rose 1/4 to 71 1/4 and USAir rose 1 to 48 3/8. Federal Express fell 7/8 to 68 3/4 and Ryder System dropped 5/8 to 37 1/4.    Pennzoil sank 4 to 78 7/8 on news that the Securities and Exchange Commission will urge the Texas Supreme Court to review an issue of federal securities law in the Texaco-Pennzoil case. The issue concerns SEC rule 10b-13, which prohibits private agreements or arrangements to purchase a target company while a tender offer by a prospective purchaser is in place. This issue is part of a request by Texaco that its appeal be heard, which it filed with the Texas Supreme Court on June 15.    Texaco rose 1 1/2 to 39 3/8 in active trading. By agreeing to file a friend-of-the-court brief, the SEC is calling attention to an issue that Texaco considers one of its strongest appellate points.    Allis-Chalmers fell 3/4 to 2 1/8 after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection.    Korea Fund soared 10 1/4 to 70 1/2. The sweeping concessions offered by the chairman of South Korea's ruling party in an effort to end civil disturbances calmed investors worried about the political unrest and the economic future in that country.    Investors have been unnerved by the turmoil in South Korea recently, and the closed-end investment company, one of the few vehicles available for investing in Korea, had dropped 8% this month before yesterday's rally.    Marine Corp. jumped 17 3/4 to 58 3/4 in over-the-counter trading. The company said Marshall andamp; Ilsley proposed the merger of the two bank holding companies. The proposal calls for Marine shareholders to receive cash or stock or a combination of cash and stock equal to $62.50 a share.    Matthews andamp; Wright Group fell 2 1/8 to 4 5/8. A class action lawsuit by bondholders was filed against the municipal bond underwriter. The suit questions the legitimacy of a $335 million tax-exempt issue sold last summer to finance a trash plant in Chester, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia.    Di Giorgio gained 3 to 30. An investor group, including Gabelli Group, a New York investment firm, said it holds a 28.59% stake in Di Giorgio. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, two of the group members said they hold their shares &quot;to ultimately gain control&quot; of Di Giorgio.    Todd Shipyards sank 1 1/4 to 9 7/8. The shipbuilder said that based on a review of its expected cash position over the next few months, it may have to defer interest payments on its senior and subordinated debt.    United Technologies moved up 1 3/8 to 50 5/8. The company estimated that its second-quarter earnings will total between $1.10 and $1.20 a share, with earnings for the first six months of 1987 between $1.85 and $1.95 a share.
