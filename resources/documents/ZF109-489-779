 As usual, PostScript and its clones will be a majorfocus: there will be new emulations, faster controllers, higher resolutions,lower prices.andP;  But its new competitor, TrueImage, may steal the spotlight inSan Jose.andP;  With both Copal and Microtek demonstrating printers usingTrueImage (and Advanced Micro Devices' AMD 29000 RISC processor), thepage-description-language war should draw plenty of attention.andM;Abaton  (5226)andM;A division of Everex Systems, Abaton will introduce three products.andP;  TheLaserScript printer, built with a National Semiconductor NS32CG16 processorand a 300-dpi, 6-ppm TEC engine, offers both PCL and the Microsoft (Bauer)PostScript emulation.andP;  Standard interfaces are AppleTalk, Centronics paralleland two RS-232 serial.andP;  The LaserScript comes with 3 MB of RAM (expandable to6 MB), 35 PostScript-compatible Bitstream fonts and 24 bitmap fonts for usewith PCL.andM;Two new scanners will also be shown: the 4-bit (16-gray-level) Scan 300/S andthe 8-bit (256-gray-level) Scan 300/GS.andP;  Each of these legal-size, 300-dpiunits can be used with a PC, PS/2 or Macintosh computer; the Scan 300/GS canalso be connected to a Next computer.andP;  Scanning and image processing softwareare included with each scanner.andM;Advanced Micro Devices  (5707)andM;AMD will feature its 29K processor as used in printer controllers.andP;  The focuswill be on the Laser29K printer controller, which provides a claimed two tofive times the performance of the LaserWriter II NTX.andP;  The parts cost beween$160 and $320, AMD says.andP;  In the booth, it will be driving an IBM 4019engine.andM;A few other exhibitors will be featuring the 29K unit also, including Bell andamp;Howell, in its Quintar color engine, which is based on QScript, a PhoenixPagederivative, and Copal, which uses it as part of a Yarc card in its 12-ppm,600-dpi plain-paper monochrome printer.andM;AMD also will be discussing an Adobe PostScript release 2 port to the 29Kfamily of processors, a MicrosoftTrue-Image port to the 29K, PhoenixPagePCL5, the Pipeline Associates PostScript clone, and PostScript solutions inless than 2 MB of RAM.andM;Bitstream  (2328)andM;Bitstream will feature revision 2 of its typeface library for the Macintosh,which will incorporate hints.andP;  It also implements changes in the namingconventions to make the system easier to use, and, with a desk accessory, itis easier to find fonts.andP;  Bitstream says it hopes to have the entire librarycompleted by November.andM;Also on display will be Facelift for Windows and a brand-new version ofFacelift for WordPerfect.andP;  Facelift is a font-scaling technology based on thesecond-generation Bitstream Speedo software.andP;  It will build soft fonts on thefly for the HP LaserJet family of printers, including the LaserJet Plus,Series II, IIP, IID and LaserJet III.andP;  It will generate type in sizes from 2to 500 points in quarter-point increments.andP;  It can access more than 360characters from the Bitstream international character set.andM;CoOperative Printing Solutions  (2703)andM;CoOperative Printing Solutions will announce and show for the first time twoproducts that it has designed mainly for the service bureau market.andP;  PsProofis a PostScript routine that proofs image-setter jobs on an Apple LaserWriterby intercepting the imagesetter calls and converting them to LaserWritercalls.andP;  PSTix is a job ticket program; it allows service bureaus' clients toassemble all data for a job, create an envelope for it and send it to aservice bureau via COPS's bulletin board system.andM;Copal Printer Products  (5124)andM;Copal, which recently opened a U.S.andP;  office to handle its 600-dpi, 11&quot;x17&quot;,plain-paper printer, will demonstrate the print engine.andP;  It will use thehigh-speed Yarc AMD29000 controller with the Microsoft TrueImage code andTrueType fonts.andP;  This configuration isn't available as a product, but itshould be interesting to see.andP;  And it won't compete with OEM customers alsousing the engine, some of which will show it in San jose (Linotype in itsPrinter 60 and Chelgraph in its PPT 600).andM;Custom Applications  (1245)andM;CAI will demonstrate version 3.0 of its Freedom of Press PostScriptinterpreter for the Macintosh and its Professional version, which may bedriving a Canon CLC 500 color copier.andP;  The version for Windows 3.0 won't beready, we were told.andM;Destiny Technology  (1916)andM;Destiny produces imaging language emulations for OEMs who want to build laserprinter controllers.andP;  It will announce its emulation of PCL5, available toOEMs as software or in the form of ASICs.andP;  PostScript-compatible controllertechnology will also be on display.andM;Digital Typeface Corp.andP;  (943)andM;This subsidiary of LaserMaster will be making its formal debut.andP;  It hasdeveloped a technology that uses artificial intelligence for automaticgeneration of hints for type.andP;  It rasterizes type at all levels ofresolution.andP;  The first product will be a set of 100 typefaces in PostScriptType 1 format for the Macintosh and PC, for a bundled price of $995.andO;Shipments will begin in November.andM;Also in the booth will be a LaserMaster plain-paper printer.andM;DP-Tek  (5025)andM;DP-Tek will feature its LaserPort PS600, a 600x600-dpi,Post-Script-compatible add-in card for Hewlett-Packard or compatibleprinters.andP;  The company also plans a surprise announcement of a new productfor the same market.andM;DynaLab Taiwan  (308)andM;DynaLab, which has developed new fonts and font generation technology fornon-Roman languages, will show some of its work with Chinese, Japanese andKorean.andP;  It will introduce a new board, half the size of the previous one,that holds four faces instead of three.andP;  DynaLab also is working on a fontgenerator for use in conjunction with a fax board, aimed at improving thequality of output on the receiving fax machine.andM;Among the typefaces to be shown are the Korean ones that have been releasedand nine Chinese and five Japanese faces.andM;DynaLab is interested in pursuing OEM arrangements with other vendors.andM;Eicon Technology  1642andM;Eicon will feature its new eiconScript 200 and 300 printer controller cardsthat use Intel 80960 RISC processors running at 16 MHz and 25 MHz,respectively.andP;  eiconScript is a family of PC-resident PostScript controllerssupporting a variety of resolutions.andP;  They offer background printing.andM;Graphic Enterprises of Ohio  (5303)andM;For a long time, Graphic Enterprises has been a key supplier of large-format,plain-paper proofing systems.andP;  Its latest version, the PageScan III, usesholographic imaging technology.andP;  It runs at a variety of resolutions,starting at 300 dpi.andP;  It is likely to be running at 1,016 x 1,016 dpi, but weweren't able to find out what RIP will be driving it.andM;Hewlette-Packard  (2216)andM;Having recently announced a passel of new products, Hewlett-Packard will beexhibiting them, many for the first time.andP;  The hardware side will behighligted by the HP LaserJet IIID, an upgraded version of its duplex laserprinter (featured for the first time), and HP DeskJet 500, an enhanced,lower-priced member of its ink-jet printer line that will use anon-water-smearable ink (at its first national showing).andM;The software spotlight will focus on AccuScan, an OCR program based onCalera's recognition technology, plus enhanced versions of HP's scanningprograms: Scanning Gallery Plus for the PC and Desk Gallery for theMacintosh.andP;  All of these programs are making their show debuts.andM;Image Club  (2250)andM;This PostScript font vendor will feature Evolution, a utility that convertsfonts between Type 1, Type 3 and TrueType formats.andM;LaserMaster  (1716)andM;LasterMaster will be showing two new products.andP;  The latest version of its Macinterface is purported to be free of the bugs reported in our article in Vol.andO;4, No.andP;  11.andP;  Also on display will be the LM1200 printer, an 11&quot;x17&quot; unit withthe same resolution as the LM1000 product (&quot;1,000x1,000 TurboRes,&quot; but really1,000x400 dpi).andP;  The printer has been shown before, but LaserMaster says thatPC and MAC versions will be available for delivery as of our conference.andM;Microtek Labs  (928)andM;The big news from Microtek will be the 300-dpi True-Laser, described as thefirst printer compatible with Microsoft's TrueImage page descriptionlanguage.andP;  It can use Apple's TrueType (formerly called Royal) fonts and iscompatible with PostScript (of which TrueImage is a superset) and PCL.andP;  Basedon a 6-ppm TEC engine and an AMD29000 RISC processor, it will sell for &quot;lessthan $3,000&quot; (which usually means either $2,999 or $2,995).andM;Microtek will also introduce Image-Star, a PC-based monochrome, gray-scaleand 24-bit color scanning and editing program.andP;  In addition, a newly releasedSparcstation 1 driver for Microtek's ScanVu software will be demonstrated.andM;Pacific Data Products  (2402)andM;Four products will be announced by Pacific Data Products:andM;* PacificPage PE 4.0--the newest version of PDP's PostScript emulationcartridge for the HP LaserJet line of printers, incorporating Bitstream'sSpeedo font renderer to improve font quality and speed.andM;* PacificType--an add-on cartridge for PacificPage that adds 40 more fonts tothe former's 35.andM;* PacificTalk--an interface module that allows LaserJets to be connected toMacintoshes on an AppleTalk network.andM;* PacificConnect-- printer multiplexer board that enables five computers tobe connected to one Laserjet; PCs and Macintoshes can use the same printer.andM;Pacific Rim Data Sciences  (5110)andM;Pacific Rim will feature a new interface between Sun MicrosystemsSparcstations and Canon printers.andP;  It will use Sun't newly announcedNewsPrint PostScript interpreter to enable a Sparcstation to drive any Canonengine at reasonably high speed.andM;Pacific Rim will supply a hardware/software package, called NewsBlaster, thatconnects to the SCSI-2 interface on the Sparcstation and to the videointerface on a Canon printer.andP;  The primary function of the Pacific Rimpackage is to take page bitmaps created in the Sparcstation, buffer them andtransfer them at high speed (typically 1.2 MB per second) to the printengine.andM;NewsBlaster supports a variety of printing resolutions.andP;  To print at 300 dpi,which is claimed to be possbile at up to 15 pages per minute, theSparcstation must be equipped with 1 MB of RAM beyond its normal systemrequirement.andP;  To print at higher resolution (up to 800x400 dpi) takes longerand requires more RAM.andP;  No memory is needed in the printer.andM;NewsBlaster will be priced at $695 for a 1-MB system that can handlefull-page, 300-dpi graphics and $895 for a 2-MB system that is switchablebetween 300 and 600 dpi for higher-quality reproduction.andP;  No memory isrequired on any Canon printer, but HP LaserJet Series II and III printersmust have a video adapter card provided by Pacific Rim for $195.andM;Pacific Rim will also show three other products announced in late September,all based on Imagen's UltraScript emulation of PostScript:andM;* PageBlaster--a SCSI/Centronics board and UltraScript, driving anyCentronics dot-matrix or laser printer or a Canon laser printer from a PC orMacintosh.andM;* PageBlaster Plus--a dual SCSI board and UltraScript, driving any HP orCanon laser printer via the video port from a PC or Mac.andM;* HappyBlaster--a SCSI/Centronics board and UltraScript, driving an HPLaserJet II from a Mac.andM;The Peerless Group  (suite)andM;Peerless does not have a booth; look for it in a suite at the Fairmont Hotel.andO;The company will be demonstrating several products:andM;* PostScript Banding Prototype--a new PostScript imaging technology designedto improve performance while reducing memory requirements.andM;* Peerless PCL5--a PCL5 clone controller that runs with both Compugraphic andBitstream fonts.andM;* PeerlessPage Printer Operating System--both TrueImage and PCL5 will bedemonstrated in this environment.andM;* IDT R3000--a PostScript controller based on a MIPS R3000 processor.andP;  TrueImage printing will be demonstrated.andM;Phoenix Technologies  (1828)andM;Third-party products will show applications of Phoenix's PostSript emulation,Phoenix-Page.andM;Xante will demonstrate a controller, based on an AMD29000 chip and Phoenix'sPostScript emulation, that replaces the native PostScript controller in anyApple LaserWriter and speeds up printing.andP;  Xante says it is roughly fourtimes as fast as the RIP in a LaserWriter IINTX.andP;  The controller hasAppleTalk, serial, parallel and SCSI interfaces and supports resolutions upto 300 X 1,200 dpi.andP;  Its list price will be $1,695.andP;  Xante plans to releaseit for the LaserWriter II family in November, for the original LaserWriter inDecember, and for the new Personal line in January.andM;Concurrently with the show, GammaData will announce a color PostScriptnetwork server module using a full color implementation of PhoenixPage thatallows Sun 3/80 workstations to print color PostScript output on a thermalcolor printer.andP;  The software interpreter is installed on the host and isavailable to all workstations on the network.andP;  this product, to bedemonstrated at the show, is being ported to the Sun Sparcstation.andP;  The SeikoColorPoint PS printer will demonstrate the results attainable with Phoenix'scolor screening algorithms.andM;Pipeline Associates (244)andM;Pipeline will showcase new products from OEM customers that use itsproducts--including PSclone, a PostScript emulation, and TypeOne, fordecoding and rasterizing Adobe Type 1 fonts--in applications ranging from200-dpi fax modems to 2,400-dpi imagesetters.andM;In late September, General Parametrics introduced its five-member SpectraStar400 thermal wax transfer color printer series.andP;  Each member uses a 300-dpiengine and offers such innovations as an autosense feature that monitors allprinter ports for activity and a proprietary port that enables up to eightprinters to be connected so that all simultaneously print the same image asthe controlling one.andM;The third member, the SpectraStar 430, will make its debut here.andP;  The 430adds AppleTalk to the standard serial and parallel ports; contains an Intel80960 RISC chip, 6 MB of RAM and 35 fonts; and employs Pipeline's PostScriptemulation, which is not offered in the 410 or 420 (though each SpectraStarprinter can be upgraded to any other level).andP;  Shipment of the SpectraStar 430is scheduled for late November at a list price of $7,995.andM;InfoCom will show its new Grafix-Setter imagesetter, which combines an Ultrerecorder, a specially configured Macintosh SE and a Pipeline RIP.andP;  Supportinga 72-pica width and resolutions from 600 to 2,400 dpi, the GrafixSetter isbeing offered at an aggressive price of $28,000.andM;Visual Business Systems will demonstrate Professional Output Manager 2.0,which uses Pipeline's interpreter to output PostScript images from aMacintosh II to a variety of color thermal printers and 35mm film recorders.andM;Printronix (917)andM;AppleTalk compatibility has been added to Printronix's 12-page-per-minute,PostScript-compatible L1212 printer; it already had a PC interface.andP;  The24-ppm, HPGL-compatible L2324 will also be shown.andM;Printware (2716)andM;Printware will unveil a new version of its 720 IQ plain-paper printer: the720 IQ Professional II, with a ZipRip.andP;  The ZipRip, developed first for the1440 PlateSetter, is based on a 68030 processor with 4 MB of memory, ratherthan the 68020 on the earlier 720 IQ.andP;  The speed difference is hard toestimate now, but Printware says it is particularly noticeable on text, butalso significant on graphics.andM;There will be no change in the price of the machine: $11,990.andP;  Machinescurrently in the field will be upgradable.andM;Printware also will demonstrate the 1440 PlateSetter.andM;Qume (1610)andM;The CrystalPrint Express ($5,595), introduced in August, is a 12-ppm laserprinter that uses a Sanyo engine and Qume's own PostScript emulation.andO;Although the engine is limited to 300-dpi spot sizes, Qume configures themachine to address 600 dpi horizontally.andP;  It can switch instantaneouslybetween PostScript and HP LaserJet emulation.andP;  (See Vol.andP;  5, No.andP;  1, p. 26,for more details.)andM;The 300-dpi CrystalPrint Publisher II ($3,995) was also released this summer.andO;Like the Express, it can use Type 1 downloadable fonts and comes with bothBitstream typefaces for PostScript and others for LaserJet Series IIemulation.andM;Raster Image Processing Systems (5302)andM;Since early last year, RIPS has been working on building a universal colorPostScript-compatible RISC controller that would work with any OEM's printer.andO;It recently announced that Colorocs had become the first OEM to license thatcontroller.andP;  In its first public appearance, the LaserLink controller will beshown driving a B-size Colorocs color printer and probably a smaller A-sizemodel.andM;Sharp Electronics (1646)andM;An Adobe PostScript printer being introduced at the show, the JX9500PS, willprint 6 pages per minute at 300 dpi using a Sharp engine.andP;  Standard featuresinclude 35 fonts, serial and parallel ports and 250-sheet capacity; the usercan add an AppleTalk connection, an envelope feeder and a tray that increasespaper capacity to 500 sheets.andP;  The unit's base price is $2,995.andM;Sharp will also announce price reductions on two 300-dpi color scanners.andP;  Theletter-size JX300 will drop from $4,000 to $2,345, while the 11&quot;X17&quot; JX450will change from $7,000 to $6,000.andM;Vital LaserType (643)andM;Vital LaserType has developed and patented a technique for preserving theaesthetics of fonts when they are condensed or expanded.andP;  Its focus is toprevent stroke weights from becoming uneven as they are modified.andP;  With somefonts, there is a tendency for horizontal and vertical strokes to changedisproportionately in these situations.andM;Vital LaserType uses the term Aesthetically Alterable Fonts (AA Fonts) todescribe the software it has patended.andP;  The company's initial product will beits own fonts that employ the technology.andP;  Eight fonts (including versionssimilar to Helvetica and Avant Garde) currently are available, all for theMacintosh.andP;  More fonts will be added, perhaps including some from othervendors' libraries, although so far no deals have been made to use thetechnology on other fonts.andM;Support for the PC will follow.andP;  This will be the first public appearance forthe fonts or the technology.andM;As a show special, Vital LaserType will offer a package of several fonts for$99.andM;Xerographic Laser Images (5518)andM;At Seybold Seminars '90, XLI showed little more than the feasibility of anidea: producing fine halftone screens on plain paper with 256 gray levels.andO;Now the company has gone from its engineering prototype to a shippingproduct.andP;  Designed for use with a LaserJet II or III, the LaserPix AT boardand utility software lets the user select TIFF images, make gray-scaleadjustments and position images on a page.andM;Other features include the abilities to make mirror images and to add a textfile to print at the same time.andP;  XLI says that no additional memory isrequired in the computer or the printer and that the printer continues toprint at its normal speed.andM;Xitron (1549)andM;Xitron will be demonstrating its 11&quot;x17&quot; Clipper laser printer equipped withboth a Weitek-based PostScript emulation and an Ace typesetter RIP (whichsupports Cora and Compugraphic command languages).andM;Font manipulationandM;Broderbund (1548)andM;Broderbund will feature its new Letterhead program and a brand-new release ofits popular Type-Styler facility for generating headlines with specialeffects.andP;  Letterhead, which was introduced formally at the recent Macworldexpo, is scheduled to be released in January.andM;Among the new features in Type-Styler 1.5 are a couple of items that addresscriticisms we had when we reviewed the product last year.andP;  One concerns howtext boxes are handled when changes are made.andP;  It is now possible to specifya fixed point size to a text object, rather than have the text automaticallybe rescaled horizontally (condensed or expanded) to fill its box, regardlessof how much it may need to be expanded or condensed to fit the space.andM;Another new item is more accurate screen representation of inlines andoutlines, so that the screen quite accurately indicates how they will lookwhen printed.andM;Also in release 1.5 are new shaping options that convert straight lines inobjects to bezier curves, allowing text objects to follow the curve of theobject's shape more accurately, and the ability to specify percentages forrotation of objects.andM;Letterhead provides a means for storing text or images and merging them withletters or other correspondence when they are output from a word processor,not requiring the user to exit the word processor to access a program forproducing borders, logos, etc.andP;  Items stored in EPS, PICT, Paint, Glue orTIFF format can be used.andM;The program comes with pre-stored templates that can be customized to suitparticular needs of a user.andM;Letterhead sells for $99.95.andM;Broderbund also will appear in the Apple booth.andM;Postcraft International (438)andM;PostCraft will show its three products, including one that is brand new:andM;* Laser FX--for creating headlines or logos by typing a word or two andclicking a mouse.andM;* Postility--for simplifying creation or modification of PostScript code,complete with error detection, glossaries and a background generator.andM;* Effects Specialist--a new font styling program that handles bitmapped orPostScript fonts, showing them on the screen in WYSIWYG format, and enableskerning, color, background generator, etc.andP;  It will drive monochrome andcolor laser printers.andM;ZSoft (1932)andM;SoftType consists of 63 typefaces along with tools for manipulating type andinstalling it into Microsoft Windows applications and Ventura Publisher.andP;  Anupgraded version of SoftType that can take PostScript fonts as input will beintroduced.andP;  ZSoft will also demonstrate its other painting, image editingand font modification programs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
