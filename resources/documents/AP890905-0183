(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Death has run hard after Ieshia Williamsfrom the moment she was born, nearly catching her on her eighthbirthday a year ago when pneumonia attacked an immune systemweakened by the AIDS virus.   Tyesha Williams, born the same September day in 1980 in the samehospital, knows death one step removed. Never infected and nowtaller, stronger and quicker in school than Ieshia, she cannot shakeher worry: ``Is my sister going to the hospital today?''   They're identical twins _ and yet they could hardly be moredifferent.   ``I'' and ``Ty,'' as they are called, do not share AIDS but theyshare its anguish. And though they differ in growth, they are closein spirit.   Clapping together, they chant the sing-song of a favorite game:   ``Mama got the measles,   ``Papa got the flu.   ``I ain't lyin',   ``Neither are you.''   Doris Williams watches. A 51-year-old widow, she adopted thetwins when their mother, barely 21, poor and jobless, gave them up.   But as Mrs. Williams cares for the girls who share identicalgenes, no one can tell her for certain why their lives have takensuch divergent paths.   ``Ieshia had the bad luck, Tyesha had the good luck,'' says Dr.James Oleske, medical director of the AIDS program at Children'sHospital in Newark, N.J.   ``What is amazing is that they shared bottles and the whole bitsince birth,'' says their pediatrician, Dr. Karl E. Russell-Brown.   Ieshia and Tyesha are among 12 sets of twins in this countryknown to have been exposed to AIDS, according to Oleske. In fourcases, only one twin was infected with the virus.   ``It's rare,'' says Oleske. ``You usually expect both and that'susually what happens.''   A tainted blood transfusion may be to blame for Ieshia's illness,or it may have been an infinitesimal difference in the blood supplyto the placenta, allowing the virus to reach her and not Tyeshabefore birth. The mother has refused to be tested for exposure tothe virus.   Ieshia has survived twice as long as do most children with AIDS.``She has got to be God's kid,'' says Mrs. Williams, a former nurse.   Ieshia was among the first diagnosed child AIDS victims in theUnited States. She was the trendsetter in getting some New Jerseyschools to accept children with the virus.   Her survival is a bright spot amid the bleakness for families anddoctors who have watched more than 700 children die of AIDS.   ``Children with AIDS have more severe recurrent bacterialinfections,'' says Oleske. ``The disease progresses much morequickly so that children will frequently die much faster than theadults.''   Oleske diagnosed Ieshia when she was 2 years old in the early1980s when immunologists like himself first started seeing cases ofwhat turned out to be pediatric AIDS. ``We didn't even know what tocall it then,'' recalls Oleske.   Today, with the increased knowledge of AIDS, a child like Ieshiawould probably be diagnosed at six months.   AIDS has delayed Ieshia's development to the point where she isin a class for neurologically impaired children, two years behindTyesha. Oleske doesn't think she'll ever catch up to her sister.   But AIDS has not dampened Ieshia's spirit, even though it hasstunted her growth. She is only 3 feet 8 inches tall, nearly a footshorter than her sister who is in fourth grade.   Ieshia is a charming child with ponytails and a smile showingsilver-capped teeth _ the latter a legacy of the decay brought on byAIDS-induced complications. And yet she's ornery, feisty and tough.   When other children taunt her in school _ after Mrs. Williamsobtained a court order to get her in _ she hurls the taunts rightback.   Her toughness masks her longing for kinder attention.   ``I made up a father for Ieshia,'' says Mrs. Williams. ``When shekept asking for this father, I gave her George, who was her mother'sbrother-in-law. ... I think she knows better but she just wants tohave a father.''   While Tyesha jumps rope double dutch and goes to Girl Scouts'summer day camp, Ieshia can only dream of such fun. ``She's toosmall,'' Tyesha explains.   Instead Ieshia goes to the park with her little cousins and playson the slides, swings and monkey bars. Her cousins play tennis, butnot Ieshia.   ``She doesn't play tennis 'cause she's not allowed to stay in thesun too long,'' says cousin Curtis Grimes.   Although no one knows for sure how Ieshia became infected,Russell-Brown and Mrs. Williams believe it was through a bloodtransfusion she received shortly after she was born.   ``They both had transfusions in the newborn period because theywere premature,'' says Russell-Brown. ``And the only logicalexplanation, I assume that she got infected by the virus from one ofthose transfusions. But again, they both had blood, and whose bloodTyesha had and whose blood Ieshia had, I don't know. There was noother exposure.''   While Oleske does not rule out blood transfusion as the cause, hesuspects Ieshia was infected through her natural mother, althoughher refusal to be tested for AIDS leaves that possibility uncertain.   If so, one explanation why only she and not Tyesha was strickenmight be very small differences in the blood supply to the placenta,the organ through which a fetus receives nourishment from themother's circulatory system.   ``Sometimes ... in one placenta you see a different flow of bloodso that it has more exposure to the virus,'' Oleske says.   Whatever the source of the virus, it gives the child littlerespite. At school, Ieshia slips into the hall to swallow AZT, alife-prolonging drug she takes every six hours.   Even at home, between the slides and the swings, she has to stopfor treatment. A nurse, Michele LaPadura, comes by daily to give hertherapy, chopping at her tiny chest with cupped hands to clear herlungs of mucus.   If there is an explanation for Ieshia's survival, part of it isthe good care and love she has received, says Oleske.   ``Ieshia is a very special girl who is one of the few cases thatgive me hope and encouragement,'' he says. ``Some days it getspretty bleak taking care of so many children that die. She's one ofthe cases that I'm most gratified with. She has survived to the daywhen we now have drugs like AZT that may in fact help cure her.''   Children's Hospital staffers have been counseling both girls. ``Ithink to a limited degree, to their age abilities, they canunderstand,'' says Oleske.   For Tyesha, AIDS means she could lose a beloved sister.   ``Every time a hospital stay comes,'' Mrs. Williams says, ``youcan tell the fear in her. When we go to the clinic, you can see herworrying. Then when we come back, she's so thrilled to see us.''   Ieshia's understanding, despite a lifetime of sickness, reflectsa child's belief in a better future. ``When I grow up,'' she says,``I want to be a nurse because I want to help sick people.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   George Esper is the AP Northeast regionalreporter, based in Boston.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Sept. 10</NOTE></DOC>
