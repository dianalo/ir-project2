The evidence of the SS-24 deployments was made public Friday by North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms. The White House quickly confirmed the Helms report, and in a press conference in Moscow yesterday the Soviet Union acknowledged that it has indeed deployed the new 6,200-mile-range ICBM, which can be launched from rail cars.    Moreover, some of these SS-24 missiles may eventually be armed with warheads from the shorter range SS20s now aimed at Europe and Asia. We have learned that in the talks on Euromissile disarmament neither side intends to destroy its warheads, but only dismantle the missiles and launchers. The Soviets will probably redeploy these warheads atop the new SS-24 missiles as they are produced.    The Soviets must be awfully confident about the arms-control obsessions of the West's current leaders. In confirming the existence of this incredible new weapon, Soviet spokesman Victor Karpov blithely asserted that &quot;the Soviet Union, while carrying out modernization of its strategic armaments, is doing it in conformity with SALT II.&quot; As if that were all that mattered. For those in the West who have convinced themselves that arms agreements will make the world a less dangerous place, the SS-24 is a dose of hard military reality.    The SS-24 has about the same range, accuracy and warhead-carrying capability as America's new MX missile. But it also has one important difference: It's based on railway cars, enhancing its ability to survive a retaliatory attack and to make detection by U.S. satellites impossible. The SS-24 launcher also has a rapid reload capability for several more missiles, potentially doubling or tripling the SS24 force.    Despite confessing the missile's existence, the Soviets are in fact engaging in extensive camouflage, concealment and deception to hide the precise number of deployed SS-24s. Senator Helms noted that &quot;for the first time the Soviets are not revealing their production figures for railway rolling stock.&quot; The vastness of the Soviet Union provides excellent opportunities for concealment and survivability of a rail-mobile ICBM.    According to the Pentagon's latest report on Soviet military power, &quot;An extensive network of rail support facilities continues to take shape&quot; for the deployment of the SS-24. More than 1,000 Soviet railroad tunnels exist along the extensive 62,000-mile Soviet railroad network supporting missile complexes. Soviet military planners could easily hide SS-24 railcars in these tunnels, or in nondescript buildings off railway sidings.    The U.S. government has long known of the Soviet Union's development and testing of the solid-fueled SS-24. Recently, President Reagan officially warned Congress of the strong probability that the Soviets would try to deploy covertly many more railmobile SS-24s. But only now has the government confirmed that some of the missiles are operational. U.S. intelligence has already reported that the Soviets have completed factories for the construction of the SS-24 missile and its rail-mobile launchers, and that the missiles and launchers are now in mass production.    U.S. intelligence in January detected deployment of at least five rail-based SS-24 missiles, each carrying 10 warheads. But as Senator Helms pointed out, these missiles are &quot;heavily camouflaged and concealed, so the number of five {SS-24s} detected must be considered a minimum number.&quot; He added that &quot;the Soviets probably have deployed more than five SS24s.&quot;    And Mr. Karpov is certainly right about the Soviet Union &quot;carrying out modernization of its strategic armaments.&quot; The Soviets are also deploying a smaller mobile missile, the SS25, based on trucks, and are developing at least two more new types of ICBMs with enhanced accuracy and greater throw-weight. As a result, the Pentagon says, &quot;By the mid-1990s the current Soviet ICBM force will have been almost entirely replaced with new systems.&quot;    The Soviet Union's deployment of the mobile SS-24s, especially if they are eventually armed with warheads from the SS-20s the Western public thinks it is negotiating out of existence in Geneva, exposes the false premise underlying the current arms-control talks. With its 6,200-mile range and accuracy, the SS-24 ICBM can destroy any major target in the world -- including Western Europe -- in less than 30 minutes.    So the Soviet Union continues to research, develop and build the world's largest and most modern arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons. In this respect, it can at least be said that the Soviet Union understands the imperatives of national security. Meanwhile, the U.S. delays the strategic defense initiative and seeks security by talking across a table in Geneva. </TEXT></DOC>
