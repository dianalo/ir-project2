But the center-right New Democracy party of ConstantineMitsotakis failed to capture a majority, meaning the conservativeswill have to try to forge a coalition with other parties or elsecall new elections.   Official results from 18,491 of the 20,081 voting precinctsclearly indicated that Mitsotakis' party would fall far short of theparliamentary majority needed to make him the next premier.   Government computer projections indicated that in Sunday's votehis party would win 144 of the 300 seats in Parliament; Papandreou'sPanhellenic Socialist Movement, 125; the Coalition of Left andProgress, 29; and one each for the conservative Democratic Renewaland a Greek-Moslem of Turkish origin from northeastern Greece.   The Ministry of Interior said today that with more than 90percent of the ballots counted, New Democracy was getting 44.43percent of the vote and Papandreou's party, also known as PASOK,39.07 percent. The Coalition of Left and Progress had 12.97 percentand the rest was split among minor parties and independents.   Official figures showed that New Democracy received 2,655,580votes, PASOK 2,335,123 and the Coalition of the Left and Progress775,403. Abstention was running about 21 percent of the 7.89 millioneligible voters.   ``New Democracy has toppled PASOK from the government,''Mitsotakis told thousands of screaming supporters from the steps ofparty headquarters as dawn rose over the capital. Tens of thousandsof supporters celebrated in the streets of central Athens.   As the results trickled in shortly after the polls closed Sundaynight, gloom set in at the socialist camp. The atmosphere was mutedat Papandreou's suburban home. His party headquarters in centralAthens closed early.   A well-laid buffet in the garden of Papandreou's spacious villaremained untouched as PASOK supporters and friends scowled at atelevision set broadcasting election results.   ``The conservatives are first and PASOK is second,'' a gaunt andtired-looking Papandreou told reporters and guests gathered in thegarden.   Papandreou has governed Greece for eight years and swallowed abitter pill today when he acknowledged he could not defeatMitsotakis, who advocates closer U.S. ties and less economiccontrols than the premier.   Papandreou nevertheless thanked supporters for denying ``anabsolute majority to the forces of conservatism.''   His government has been rocked by financial and arms scandalsthat led to the firings or resignations of eight Cabinet members.The 70-year-old Papandreou also was hurt by a divorce from hisAmerican-born wife, Margaret, and his affair with a former airlinestewardess half his age.   Still, Mitsotakis' lack of a majority left Papandreou with achance to salvage a third four-year term at the helm of Greece'sturbulent politics.   When there is no majority, the constitution requires thepresident to give the leading party three days to form a governingcoalition.   Mitsotakis is expected to meet with President ChristosSartzetakis on Tuesday. If Mitsotakis fails to muster enoughsupport, PASOK and then the Coalition of Left and Progress must begiven the chance.   Should all efforts fail, the president can form a caretakergovernment and call new elections. Papandreou remains premier untilefforts to form a coalition are exhausted.   The premier refused to answer questions about a coalition todaybut hinted at the possibility by noting that leftist parties _ PASOKand the Coalition _ would have a majority.   Before Sunday's vote, both Papandreou and Mitsotakis said that informing a government, they would reject support from the communists.   The Coalition had hoped to emerge as a third force in Greekpolitics and a power broker in any negotiations for a new government.   Papandreou came to power in 1981 promising to lead Greece out ofNATO and the European Economic Community and to close U.S. militarybases around the country. His maverick foreign policy created a newpride in a country accustomed to feeling like a poor cousin of therich West.   However, he now supports membership in both NATO and the ECC andis negotiating a new base agreement with the Americans.   Mitsotakis, 71, who calls himself an advocate of a free-marketeconomy, campaigned with promises to clean up the scandals and putthe ailing economy back on track. Inflation is running at 14 percent.   The biggest scandal has centered on fugitive banker GeorgeKoskotas. He is charged with swindling more than $200 million fromthe Bank of Crete to build a publishing empire and buy a top Greeksoccer team.   Koskotas has accused Papandreou of masterminding the plan to lootthe bank as a way of financing his election campaign. The premierhas denied any wrongdoing.</TEXT></DOC>
