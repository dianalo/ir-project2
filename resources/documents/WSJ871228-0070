U.S. trade officials said the action won't seriously hurt Chile's trade, because it removes from duty-free status products representing only about $60 million in annual Chilean exports. Chile's exports total about $800 million.    But the decision signals the administration's waning sympathy for the autocratic regime of Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, as well as its determination to enforce trade statutes strictly.    In another separate move illustrating that trade posture, the White House authorized punitive tariffs on $100 million in imported foodstuffs from the European Community, but simultaneously suspended the action on a conditional basis.    The White House is legally required to suspend countries from participation in the tariff program, called the Generalized System of Preferences, or GSP, if they consistently violate internationally recognized workers' rights. Congress, at the AFL-CIO's urging, incorporated that provision into a 1984 law that renewed the GSP program for 10 years.    The GSP program confers duty-free status to about $14 billion in imports from 141 developing countries or territories. Among the other countries suspended from the program for workers' rights violations are Paraguay and Nicaragua.    The State Department tried for nearly two years to talk Chile into changing its policies to comply with the provision. The Chilean government has consistently impeded labor organizing and attempts at collective bargaining. When the Pinochet regime arrested prominent Chilean labor leaders last October, the U.S. was left with no choice but to invoke the trade statute, U.S. officials confided.    A Chilean Embassy spokeswoman said her government had no immediate comment on the U.S. action.    Chilean products to be dropped from the GSP program include plywood, corn, various fruits, and lithium compounds. The action will take effect in about two months.    U.S. trade officials said the prospective sanctions against the European Community products are intended to deter the Common Market from enforcing a ban against the sale or imports of meat from animals treated with growth hormones. The White House order keeps the tariffs from taking effect for as long as the ban isn't enforced.    The EC contends that the consumption of beef from hormone-fed stock poses health hazards, but the U.S. rejects that claim on the basis of studies by the Food and Drug Administration and other institutions.    The ban initially was to have taken effect this coming Friday, but the EC postponed it for a year to give the concerned governments enough time to resolve conflicting scientific opinions about the use of these hormones.    The value of the EC products that are conditionally subject to U.S. sanctions is equivalent to the business U.S. beef producers would lose if the ban shuts them out of the Common Market.    If the EC activated its ban, the U.S. would automatically impose 100% duties on a wide variety of fresh or processed European foods, including boneless beef, processed pork hams and shoulders, saltpacked tomatoes, fruit juices and sausage casings. </TEXT></DOC>
