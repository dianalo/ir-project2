The facility is located in Somervell County,Texas, approximately 40 miles southwest of Fort Worth, Texas. This supplementpresents the staff's evaluation of the Texas Utilities Electric Company's(lead applicant's) corrective action program (CAP) related to equipmentqualification. The scope and methodology for the CAP workscope, as summarizedin Revision 0 to the Equipment Qualification Project Status Report andas detailed in related documents, were developed to resolve various issuesraised by the Comanche Peak Response Team (CPRT) and the NRC staff toensure that plant equipment is appropriately environmentally and/or seismicallyand dynamically qualified and documented in accordance with the validatedplant design resulting from other CAP scopes of work for Unit 1 and areascommon to Units 1 and 2. The staff concludes that the CAP workscope forequipment qualification provides a comprehensive program for resolvingthe concerns identified by the CPRT and the NRC staff, including issuesraised in the Comanche Peak Safety Evaluation Report and its supplements,and its implementation will ensure that the environmental and/or seismicand dynamic qualification of equipment at CPSES satisfies the validatedplant design and the applicable requirements of 10 CFR Part 50. As isroutine staff practice, the NRC staff will verify the adequacy of implementationof the environmental and seismic and dynamic equipment qualificationprogram at CPSES during inspections that will take place before fuelloading. 97 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
