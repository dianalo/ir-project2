The proposed accord, which deals mainly with theconstitutional concerns of Quebec, will lapse if it isn'tratified by all provincial legislatures by June 23, a legaldeadline.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Harper, by filibustering, has already seriouslydelayed the Manitoba Legislature's consideration of theproposed ratification bill. The Manitoba government warnedthat its legislature would have difficulty passing theratification bill by June 23 even with the cooperation of allits 57 members, because of Manitoba's requirements for publichearings on legislation.   Mr. Harper, who represents a northern Manitobaconstituency, is opposed to the constitutional plan becausehe believes it doesn't adequately address the concerns ofCanadian Indians and other native groups.   Political polls in Quebec show strong support forseparation from the rest of Canada if the proposed agreement,known as the Meech Lake Accord, isn't ratified. Theagreement, negotiated three years ago at Meech Lake, Quebec,would recognize the largely French-speaking province as a&quot;distinct society&quot; within Canada. The designation would beused by the courts in interpreting the constitution.   Native groups assert that they have as much claim asQuebec to special status in the constitution. They alsoobject to the veto powers that the Meech Lake Accord wouldgrant Quebec and other provinces over future constitutionalchanges, possibly affecting native rights.   Mr. Harper delayed the Manitoba government's introductionof the ratification bill by refusing to give his consent to amotion that would have permitted the legislature to forgo theusual 48 hours of notice for a new bill.   The 48-hour notice period ended yesterday but Mr. Harperfurther delayed proceedings by raising points of order andputting 17 questions to Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon andmembers of his cabinet. Mr. Harper has broad support for hisactions in Manitoba. A recent poll showed that 51% ofManitobans thought the Meech Lake Accord should be scrapped.   The constitutional plan also faces uncertain ratificationprospects in Newfoundland, where the legislature is scheduledto vote late next week. Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells saidhe doesn't like the agreement but has urged legislators tomake up their own minds. Another holdout province, NewBrunswick, is expected to ratify the accord today. The otherseven provinces have already ratified it.   The leaders of all parties in the Manitoba Legislaturehave recommended approval of the proposed constitutionalamendments. Mr. Harper, a member of the New Democratic Party,has broken ranks with the party's leadership.</TEXT></DOC>
