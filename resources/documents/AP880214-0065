Further detentions are expected in the case, said an armyofficial, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the detaineesare being questioned, but that no charges have been filed. Hedeclined to give further details.   In Gaza City, army officials said three Arabs were injured whena firebomb they were preparing exploded. They refused to providefurther details. Gaza residents reported hearing a loud explosionat about 7 p.m.   It was the second such incident in two days. On Saturday, twoGaza City residents were injured while preparing a homemade bomb.   In the Golan Heights, hundreds of Druse pelted police withstones and sang patriotic songs to protest Israel's annexation ofthe area six years ago. Some demonstrators chanted ``with blood andfire we will liberate the Golan.''   Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets, Israel televisionsaid. The report said more than two dozen Druse were arrested, 32injured by rubber bullets and scores overcome by tear gas. Fivepolice officers were hurt after being struck by stones and severalothers also were overcome by the gas, the report said.   Elsewhere, scattered Palestinian protests were reported Sundayin the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territories captured from Jordanand Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. In Gaza, assailants torchedan Israeli bus, and in Jerusalem nine cars were set ablaze.   The two soldiers were detained after news reports said troopsused a a bulldozer to bury alive four Arabs Feb. 5 in the West Bankvillage of Kfar Salem after violent anti-Israeli protests there.   An army official confirmed that soldiers ``misbehaved'' duringan incident at the village, but refused further comment until theinvestigation is completed.   An Israeli reporter who visited Kfar Salem on Sunday quotedresidents as saying about 20 soldiers grabbed four men in theirearly 20s, ordered them to remove roadblocks, then beat them andforced them to lie on the ground.   A bulldozer pulled up and covered the men with dirt, said thereporter of the daily Yediot Ahronot, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   The Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted villagers as saying the menwere unconscious when they were dug out. The Yediot reporter saidthree of the men were treated and released from a Jericho hospitalwhile the fourth was hospitalized for eight days.   The Jerusalem Post quoted one of the men, Abdel Latif Shtiya, assaying his shoes remained buried in the dirt.   The army said it was checking reports of a similar incident nearthe Shati refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. But a spokesman said hehad no further details Sunday.   The army said a woman from the West Bank refugee camp of Arrubwho died during anti-Israeli protests Feb. 6 was killed by bulletsfired from a Soviet-made Kalashnikov assault rifle. The army saidIsraeli soldiers don't carry such weapons.   Hundreds of Druse youths, demonstrating to mark the sixthanniversary of Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights, threwstones at police in the village of Majdal Shams.   About 1,000 riot police were deployed in Druse villages to quellthe protests.   Army radio said several youths were hurt after police moved indespite pleas from local leaders for security forces to stay clear.   ``People started to sing nationalistic songs and to showidentification with our country, Syria, and against theoccupation,'' Kansh Abu Sallah, a village leader, told the radio.``Then the police began to interfere, so it started to roll untilit led to tear gas.''   Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 warand officially annexed the territory on Feb. 14, 1982. The Druse,members of a mystical sect that is an offshoot of Shiite Islam,have marked each anniversary with demonstrations.   A general strike continued Sunday throughout the Gaza Strip,where an Israeli civilian bus was burned by Palestinian youths. InJerusalem, police spokesman Rafi Levy said nine cars were setablaze in the Jewish French Hill neighborhood of the city.   In the Shufat refugee camp in Jerusalem, about 60 rock-hurlingArabs staged demonstrations. Police fired tear gas and rubberbullets to disperse the crowd.
