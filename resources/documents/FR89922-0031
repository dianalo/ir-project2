(SPI) filed with EPA a petition for stay of enforcement and administrativereconsideration of seven provisions in the final rule revising the nationalemission standard for VC (September 30, 1986, 51 FR 34904). The SPI andthree manufacturers (Dow Chemical Company, Georgia Gulf Corporation, andVista Chemical Company) concurrently filed a petition for review of therevisions to the VC standard with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Districtof Columbia Circuit. The petitioners requested review of the definitionsof ``ethylene dichloride purification,'' ``leak,'' ``exhaust gas,'' ``reliefvalve discharge,'' and ``3-hour period;'' the scope of the relief valvedischarge provisions; and the leak detection and elimination provisions(area monitoring). The EPA has evaluated the petitions, and the Administratorproposes to grant the petitioners' request for clarification of certainof these provisions. Minor revisions are being proposed to correct ambiguitiesin several definitions and in the applicability of certain regulatory requirementsin the VC standards. The proposed revisions would not increase the emissions(and the associated health risks) allowed by the standards as promulgatedin September 1986. No changes, however, will be made with regard to areamonitoring requirements or the relief valve discharge standard. This actionprovides EPA's responses to petitioners' requests, and the resulting minorproposed revisions to the standards are set forth in this notice. This action also serves as notice that the petitioners' request for stayof the 1986 revised provisions is being denied.

Background </ITAG>In December 1975, EPA designated VC as a hazardous air pollutant undersection 112 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412) and promulgated finalrules for VC on October 21, 1976 (40 CFR 61.60-61.71). The standards limitemissions of VC from plants producing ethylene dichloride (EDC) via oxychlorination,VC, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or other polymers containing VC. Theseplants are subject to a combination of emission limits, equipment, andwork practice requirements at numerous points in the manufacturing processes.On September 30, 1986 (51 FR 34904), EPA promulgated several administrativeand clarifying revisions to the national emission standard for VC. Subsequently,on November 26, 1986, SPI filed with EPA a petition for stay and administrativereconsideration of seven provisions in the final revisions to the VC standard.The SPI, Dow Chemical Company, Georgia Gulf Corporation, and Vista ChemicalCompany concurrently filed a petition for review of several provisionsof the revised standard with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.The SPI is a nonprofit corporation whose members include processors andmanufacturers of plastics or plastic products, suppliers of raw materials,processors and converters of plastic resins, and manufacturers of accessoryequipment for the plastics industry. The Vinyl Institute, a division ofSPI, represents the major domestic producers of VC and PVC.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of SPI's Petition for Stay/Reconsideration and EPA's Response</ITAG>The SPI requested that EPA issue a stay of the 1986 revisions to the VCstandard pending review of those revised provisions. Their request fora stay was based on the following factors: (1) Certain provisions of the1985 proposal were changed without adequate notice or justification byEPA; (2) industry members represented by SPI would suffer irreparable harmif the effectiveness of the 1986 revisions are not stayed during the reviewperiod; and (3) a stay will cause no harm to other parties or the publicinterest.The EPA has considered the factors presented by SPI in support of theirrequest for stay of the 1986 VC revisions pending EPA's review of the revisions.Having considered the likelihood of SPI's success on the merits of itspetition for reconsideration, the likelihood that SPI would be irreparablyharmed absent a stay, the prospect that others would be harmed in the eventof a stay, and the public interest, the Administrator has not stayed the1986 revisions of the VC standard at issue here. This is consistent withlong-standing EPA policy to continue to enforce an existing regulationuntil and unless a revision becomes formally effective. The EPA's policyhas been consistently approved by the courts in the context of State ImplementationPlans. See <T3>Train </T3>v. <T3>NRDC,  </T3>421 U.S. 60, 92 (1975) (``This litigation, however, iscarried out on the polluter's time not the public's, for during [the pendencyof a SIP revision] the original regulations remain in effect, and the polluter'sfailure to comply may subject him to a variety of enforcement procedures.'')The rationale in <T3>Train </T3>applies with equal force to regulations promulgated undersection 112. Therefore, EPA hereby denies SPI's request for a stay pendingEPA's reconsideration of the VC standard. In the petition for review of the revised standard, SPI claimed that the1986 promulgated revisions differed significantly from the revisions thatwere proposed on January 9, 1985 (50 FR 1182). The SPI asserted that without adequate notice, EPA's 1986 revisions changedkey provisions of the VC standard in a manner that: (1) Violated case law;(2) imposed new penalties; (3) created multiple penalties for the sameevent; and (4) expanded the types of equipment subject to the standard.The following discussion summarizes their concerns and EPA's responses.Definition of ``Exhaust Gas'' The SPI requested a review of several definitions in the VC standard. Accordingto SPI, the 1986 final definition of ``exhaust gas,'' 40 CFR 61.61(x),deleted a key sentence from the proposed definition without adequate explanation.By omitting the sentence, ``A leak * * * is not an exhaust gas,'' SPI wasconcerned that leak emissions could result in violations of the exhaustgas standard if more than 10 ppm of VC are emitted. Reconsideration wasrequested because leaks from equipment in VC service would exceed the 10ppm emission limitation for exhaust gases, thereby subjecting industriesto a potential fine of $25,000 per day for each leak. It was not EPA's intent to categorize every leak of greater than 10 ppmas an exhaust gas. The sentence was omitted in the final definition becausesome emissions which are required to be vented to a control device cannotbe automatically categorized as either a leak or exhaust gas by a generaldefinition. As stated in the promulgation BID for the revised standards(pp. 2-54 and 2-55), the facts of the situation resulting in these emissionsneeded to be considered when deciding which part of the VC standard applied.Upon reconsideration, EPA agrees with SPI's concern that the final definitionof ``exhaust gas'' does not provide for exemption from the exhaust gasstandard (10 ppm) when such an emission is judged to be a leak. Therefore,EPA is proposing to modify the definition by adding two sentences whichclarify that a leak is not an exhaust gas, and that equipment containingexhaust gas must comply with andSection;61.65(b)(8) requiring leak detectionand prevention, whether or not that equipment contains 10 percent by volumeVC. This proposed addition assures that leaks from exhaust gas streamsare subject to the leak detection and elimination requirements, but thatsuch leaks will not also be classified as ``exhaust gas.'' Definition of ``Relief Valve Discharge'' The SPI objected to a sentence added to the 1986 final definition of ``reliefvalve discharge,'' 40 CFR 61.61(y), which stated that a relief valve dischargewould be exempt from regulation if vented to a control device, but onlyif the control device meets the 10 ppm emission limit. The SPI pointedout that a double violation could occur (i.e., of the relief valve dischargeand exhaust gas standards) if a relief valve discharge is vented to a controldevice not meeting 10 ppm. If interpreted to impose double penalties, thisprovision, in SPI's view, would exceed EPA's statutory authority and unlawfullyincrease the maximum statutory penalty set by Congress for a single eventthat leads to a violation of a NESHAP. The SPI believes that owners/operatorsof regulated facilities have sufficient economic incentive (preventingreleases of their product) to ensure that pressure relief valves work asdesigned, regardless of the standard promulgated. Moreover, the final definitioncontradicts past regulatory interpretation that relief valve dischargesducted to flares and other control devices are exempt from the exhaustgas standard. The EPA agrees that venting a relief valve discharge (RVD) to a combustiondevice achieves significant emission reduction benefits. These devices,when properly designed and operated, generally have efficiencies of 98percent or greater. The use of combustion devices are not expected to increasethe number of RVD's. Thus, because regulated facilities do have some economicincentive to ensure that RVD's are minimized, the net RVD emission reductionresulting from the use of combustion devices should approach 98 percentor more. Therefore, minor revisions to the definition of ``relief valvedischarge'' and to the RVD provisions (andSection; 61.65(a)) are being proposedto clarify that an RVD routed to a properly designed and operated controldevice would be exempted from the provisions of the RVD standard. Thischange would prevent misinterpretation of the regulatory requirements andimposition of a double penalty. In addition, new provisions (andSection; 61.65(d)) have been added for anRVD that is ducted to a control device that is continually operating whileemissions from the release are present at the device. An RVD that is ductedto a control device, other than a flare, would be subject to the 10 ppmlimit and the continuous emission monitoring system requirement containedin andSection; 61.68 and to the reporting requirements of andSection; 61.70.In the case of flares, emission monitoring is not possible. Therefore,for RVD's routed to a flare, the design requirements for flares (40 CFR60.18) would apply. The EPA recognizes that measurement of relief valvedischarge volumetric flow rates and gas stream composition is not possibleusing the methods set forth in andSection; 60.18 (f)(3) and (f)(4). Estimatesof these parameters will, therefore, need to be based on empirical or otherbases, subject to EPA approval. Flare operations would be monitored inaccordance with the requirements of andSection;andSection; 60.18(d) and 60.18(f)(2).For the purpose of andSection; 60.18(d), the volume and component concentrationof each RVD would be estimated and calculations would be made to verifyongoing compliance with the design and operating requirements of andSection;60.18 (c)(3) through (c)(6). If more than one relief valve is dischargedsimultaneously to a single flare, these calculations would account forthe cumulative effect on all such RVD's. If the results of the monitoringcontained in andSection; 60.18(f)(2) or any other information show that thepilot flame is not present 100 percent of the time during which an RVDis routed to a flare, the RVD is subject to the provisions of andSection;61.65(a). A report describing the flare design must be provided to theAdministrator not later than 90 days after the adoption of this provisionor within 30 days of the installation of a flare system for control ofRVD's, whichever is later. Definition of a ``Leak'' The SPI objected to EPA's defining ``indications of liquid dripping'' asa ``leak,'' 40 CFR 61.61(w). The SPI requested that the phrase be deletedor revised to refer to VC since dripping liquids may not always containVC. In the VC standard, the portion of the leak definition referring to ``indicationsof liquid dripping'' applies only to pumps in VC service. The EPA believesthat ``indications of liquid dripping'' are an appropriate criterion forrequiring repair actions on double mechanical seal pumps in VC serviceand, therefore, should be included in the definition of a leak. As statedin the BID for the 1986 promulgated revisions, visible leakage from alltypes of pump seals, including double mechanical seals required by theVC standard, is generally indicative of seal wear even if no VC is presentin the leaking fluid. To prevent further seal wear resulting in major sealfailure allowing VC emissions into the atmosphere, the seals should berepaired soon after leakage is initially detected. After further considerationof SPI's concern, however, EPA agrees that some amount of barrier fluidleakage is normal. Therefore, EPA proposes to revise the standards forpumps (andSection; 61.242-2(d)) to clarify the requirements for pump sealdrips. Section 61.242-2(d)(4) addresses drips from pump seals that containVC, and andSection; 61.242-2(d)(6) addresses drips from pump seals that donot contain VC.The proposed revised provisions of andSection; 61.242-2(d) are designed toaccomplish two purposes. One is to ensure that VC leaks from pump sealsare detected and eliminated. This is accomplished by paragraphs (d)(4)(i), (ii), and (iii). The other purpose is to identify and prevent pumpseal failures by causing abnormal dripping (even when VC is not containedin the dripping liquid) to be detected and repairs to be made. This isaccomplished by paragraphs (d)(6) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv). These paragraphsrequire the facility owner/operator to establish criteria associated withnormal operation.The intent of the proposed revised provisions is identical to the existingprovisions. The difference is that the proposed andSection; 61.242.2(d)(6)(i)allows an owner/operator to take into account the small number of liquiddrips that may occur when new seals are in place or are otherwise associatedwith normal operation.Definition of ``3-hour Period''The SPI noted that, in the September 1986 final rule, EPA added a definitionof ``3-hour period'' 40 CFR 61.61(z), to clarify that the emission limitsin the exhaust gas standard (10 ppm) is a 3-hour average. The definitioncreates ``rolling'' averages (24 3-hour averages per day) rather than ``block''averages (8 3-hour averages). The SPI objected that a single, 1-hour 10ppm exceedance could result in three violations of the 10 ppm exhaust gasstandard, under the revised definition of ``3-hour period.'' This couldlead to double or triple penalties, ``thereby exceeding the maximum penaltypermissible under the Clean Air Act.'' Upon reconsideration, EPA proposes to further revise the definition of``3-hour period'' to ensure that a single event of 1-hour or less at 10ppm or greater could result in no more than a single violation of the exhaustgas standard. A phrase has been added to the definition in 61.61(z) toaccomplish this. The EPA did not intend to penalize a plant three timeswhenever a 10 ppm event occurs within 1 hour. Rather, EPA wanted to ensurethat a combination of two or more 10 ppm events which would result in a3-hour exceedance do not go unpenalized just because they occurred overtwo separate 3-hour ``blocks.'' The proposed revised definition of ``3-hourperiod'' satisfies EPA's intent without unintentionally subjecting a plantowner/operator to multiple violations. Definition of ``Ethylene Dichloride Purification'' According to SPI, the 1986 final revisions changed the definition of EDCpurification, 40 CFR 61.61(o). The promulgated definition excluded productstorage following the final VC finishing column, and thus exempted suchstorage from the exhaust gas standard. The SPI believes that EPA intendedto exclude not only EDC final product storage but also intermediate productstorage (before the final finishing column) based on EPA's response tocomments contained in the BID (pp. 2-43 and 2-44) and in the BID summaryof changes since proposal (pp. 1-2). Although it supports the exemptionof final EDC product storage from the definition, SPI requested that EPAalso exempt intermediate EDC product storage. In addition, one SPI company,a major producer of VC monomer and PVC polymer, provided information onnine crude and intermediate storage tanks at one of its facilities. Theinformation included tank sizes, design, emissions estimates, and costs.This company requested EPA to exclude intermediate and crude, as well asfinal EDC storage tanks, from the definition. The EPA agrees that it intended to exempt crude and intermediate storagetanks from the exhaust gas standard. The definition of ``EDC purification''has been revised to clarify that emissions from crude, intermediate, andfinal storage tanks following EDC formation are not subject to the standards.In addition, andSection; 61.65(b)(6), Opening of equipment, has also beenrevised to clarify that the requirements in this section do not apply tocrude, intermediate, or final EDC storage tanks. As stated in the BID response(pp. 2-43 through 2-45), EPA evaluated the reasonableness of regulatingEDC storage tanks under the VC standard. Based on emissions data submittedby the commenters, uncontrolled VC emissions from intermediate and finalEDC storage tanks at a typical EDC/VC plant were estimated to be 0.1 to2 Mg/yr. An emission reduction as high as 14 Mg/yr from all plants wouldbe achieved based on venting existing EDC storage tanks to an existingprimary control device (incinerators). Prior to the September 1986 rule,EPA concluded that regulation of these tanks under the VC standard wasnot warranted. In response to SPI's petition for reconsideration, EPA has evaluated thedata submitted by one SPI company (Docket Entry No. VI-B-4) for nine crudeand intermediate EDC storage tanks before the final finishing column atone of its facilities. These tanks are currently uncontrolled. The dataincluded tank sizes, design, emissions estimates, and costs. The company'sestimates of the total uncontrolled emissions (0.002 to 0.323 Mg/yr VC)for the nine crude and intermediate tanks fall at the low end of the rangeof individual VC tank emission estimates made by EPA for EDC final productstorage tanks. This information is consistent with EPA's position thatthe regulation of crude and intermediate storage tanks is unnecessary becauseemissions are extremely low. Leak Detection and Elimination Under the 1976 VC standard, 40 CFR 61.65(b)(8), companies installed areamonitors and developed plant-specific leak detection and elimination programsthat included the routine use of portable monitors. Subsequently, EPA developeda generic leak detection and elimination program (subpart V, 40 CFR 61.240_61.247)based on equipment and data for the organic chemical and petroleum industries.Tne 1986 revisions incorporated the subpart V provisions into the VC standard.The SPI opposes the addition of the subpart V provisions to the VC standard.The SPI argued that existing programs are effective without the subpartV provisions and that EPA's decision to retain area monitoring requirementsfrom the 1976 standard is questionable since they have not been requiredfor other industries subject to subpart V. In addition, according to SPI,no justification has been given for requiring retention of area monitorsin addition to subpart V. Although a program under andSection; 61.65(b)(8)demonstrating less than 2 percent of valves leaking is considered ``effective,''such a program is exempt only from certain parts of subpart V. For thesereasons, SPI requests reinstatement of the leak detection and eliminationrequirements contained in the 1976 VC standard. Upon reconsideration, EPA proposes to make no changes in the applicationof subpart V to the VC standard and the requirements for fixed area monitoring(andSection; 61.65(b)(8)(i)). The basis for adding subpart V to the VC standardwas explained in detail in the preamble to the proposed revisions (50 FR1190-1192, January 9, 1985), and the justification for those requirementshas not changed since that time. The EPA believes that the area monitoringand subpart V approaches both have benefits and are not redundant. In particular,area monitors allow for quick detection of certain large VC leaks thatmight otherwise go undetected until the next routine portable monitoringscreening, as well as detection of large leaks from equipment not affectedby subpart V (e.g., agitators). The area monitors have already been purchasedby subject facilities and the additional cost of monitor operation is relativelysmall. Therefore, a comparison to other industries is not relevant. Also,area monitoring is often used as part of a program to reduce leaks to below2 percent, and therefore, as discussed below, an owner/operator does nothave to conduct the leak detection and repair provisions of subpart V.Any plant with an effective existing program under andSection; 61.65(b)(8)for detecting and repairing leaks can control equipment leaks without complyingwith the subpart V provisions. Specifically, if an owner/operator can demonstratethat less than 2.0 percent of valves are leaking in any process unit, thenthat process unit is exempt from andSection;andSection; 61.242-1(d) (marking),61.242-7(a) (monitoring), 61.246 (recordkeeping), and 61.247 (reporting).To demonstrate that less than 2.0 percent of valves are leaking, the owner/operatormust conduct a performance test initially, annually, and at any other timesrequested by the Administrator. If, during any performance test, the percentageof leaking valves exceeds 2.0 percent, then the owner/operator must complywith subpart V within 90 days. This exemption only applies to the standardsfor valves (andSection; 61.242-7(a)(b)(c)) because the other standards insubpart V interface with specific equipment requirements/performance measuresin the VC standard (e.g., leaks from relief valves, andSection; 61.65(b)(4)and rotating pumps, andSection; 61.65(b)(3)(i)). However, this exemptionincludes all of the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of andSection;andSection;61.246 and 61.247 because these requirements mainly affect valves. Theexemption for marking, recordkeeping, and reporting applies to the entireprocess unit. The exemptions (provided in the VC standard) to subpart Vwere designed, based on comments made during the public comment period,to avoid unnecessary changes to existing leak detection plans which areeffective in detecting and repairing VC leaks. Scope of Relief Valve Discharge Provisions The SPI opposes EPA's withdrawal of the 1985 proposed numerical limitsfor relief valve discharges and has requested that EPA reconsider its decisionto retain the emergency discharge Provision of the 1976 standard, 40 CFR61.65(a). The SPI claimed that the 1976 standard ``impermissibly delegatesrulemaking authority to enforcement personnel and is unconstitutionallyvague and that, as applied, the regulation is unfair, unlawful, arbitraryand capricious.'' The SPI prefers the proposed numerical limits becausethey would remedy these problems and reduce the administrative burden onEPA and industry. The SPI also believes that the proposed numerical limitsare stricter than the 1976 emergency discharge provision because ``eachdischarge causing an exceedance of any numerical limit * * * would be considereda violation without regard to whether any individual discharge was preventable.''The EPA has reviewed the basis for the decision not to promulgate numericallimits for RVD's and has decided that the 1976 standard is still reasonableand appropriate. The 1976 standard permits only ``emergency'' RVD's, thosethat could not have been avoided by taking measures to prevent the discharge.A detailed discussion of the basis for not promulgating the numerical limitsfor RVD's is contained in the preamble for the promulgated amendments (51FR 34905-34906, September 30, 1986), and SPI has not provided any new informationthat would affect EPA's decision. In summary, the decision to retain theoriginal 1976 RVD standard was made after considering the revisions inlight of public comments on the numerical limits, and after review of thebasis for the decision to reformat the standard. In particular, several public comments on the 1985 proposed amendmentsexpressed concern that preventable RVD's would be allowed under the revisedstandard and that the performance allowed under the revised standard couldbe inconsistent with that allowed under the original standard. Other commentsexpressed concern that the revised standard included no mechanism for regulatingvery large RVD's. The basis for the statement that a large EPA resourcecommitment is required for enforcing the 1976 RVD standard was also questioned.The EPA's review revealed that the burden on its resources had diminishedas experience with the implementation of the standard increased and asthe industry's understanding of the provisions of the existing standardbecame clearer. Thus, it was not necessary to revise the format of theRVD standard. Compared to the 1985 proposal, the existing standard alsohas the advantages of affecting all preventable RVD's and providing betterregulation of large volume RVD's. Therefore, for the reasons stated, EPA'sreview of the record supports the existing standard. Based on the EPA's experience with administering the VC standard of andSection;61.65(a), one major deficiency with the type of information submitted inmany of the 10-day reports of RVD's has been recognized. This concernsthat information required to be reported by the standard regarding, ``theaction that was taken to prevent the discharge.'' For purposes of clarification,this portion of the standard requires information on the action taken toprevent or address the cause leading up to the RVD release and not onlythe action taken after an event or cause occurs that results in an RVDrelease. Emission Monitoring Clarification In addition to the changes made in response to the petition for reconsideration,a minor clarification has been made in andSection; 61.68, Emission monitoring.The existing regulation, andSection; 61.68(b), states that the VC monitoringsystem(s) that is used to meet the continuous monitoring requirements inparagraph (a) (of andSection; 61.68) for emissions from sources for whichemission limits are prescribed is to be a device which obtains air sampleson a continuous sequential basis and analyzes them. Since it is obviousthat paragraph (a) of andSection; 61.68 calls for the monitoring of the emissionsfrom prescribed sources for vinyl chloride and not ambient air samplingas required under andSection; 61.65(b)(8) for leak detection/elimination,andSection; 61.68(b) has been clarified to require that representative (notair) samples from one or more applicable emission points be obtained andanalyzed. This revision more accurately reflects the original intent. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Administrative Requirements </ITAG>A.

B. Docket The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submittedto or otherwise considered in the development of this proposed rulemaking.The principal purposes of the docket are: (1) To allow interested partiesto identify readily and locate documents so that they can effectively participatein the rulemaking process; and (2) to serve as the record in case of judicialreview, except for interagency review materials (section 307(d)(7)(A)).C. Office of Management and Budget Reviews 1. <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act.</T3> There are no information collection requirementsassociated with this proposed rulemaking. 2. Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulatory actionis ``major'' and, therefore, subject to the requirement of a regulatoryimpact analysis. This proposed rulemaking is not major because it makesminor clarifying revisions to an existing regulation and, therefore, resultsin none of the significant adverse economic effects described in the Order.This rulemaking was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for review as required by Executive Order 12291. Any written comments fromOMB to EPA and any EPA response to those comments are included in DocketNo. A-81-21. The docket is available for public inspection at EPA's CentralDocket Section that is listed under the <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section of this notice. D. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires the identification of potentiallyadverse impacts of Federal regulations upon small business entities. TheAct specifically requires the completion of a Regulatory Flexibility Analysisin those instances where small business impacts are possible. Because theseproposed minor revisions impose no adverse economic impacts, a RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis has not been conducted. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that theproposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 61 </ITAG>Air pollution control, Asbestos, Benzene, Beryllium, Hazardous materials,Mercury, Vinyl chloride.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.

Section 61.61 is amended by revising paragraphs (o), (w), (x),  (y),and (z) to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 61.61</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(o) <T3>Ethylene dichloride purification</T3> includes any part of the processof ethylene dichloride purification following ethylene dichloride formation,but excludes crude, intermediate, and final ethylene dichloride storagetanks. <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(w) <T3>Leak</T3> means any of several events that indicate interruption ofconfinement of vinyl chloride within process equipment. Leaks include eventsregulated under subpart V of this part such as:(1) An instrument reading of 10,000 ppm or greater measured according toMethod 21 (see appendix A of 40 CFR part 60);(2) A sensor detection of failure of a seal system, failure of a barrierfluid system, or both;(3) Detectable emissions as indicated by an instrument reading of greaterthan 500 ppm above background for equipment designated for no detectableemissions measured according to Test Method 21 (see appendix A of 40 CFRpart 60); and(4) In the case of pump seals regulated under andSection; 61.242-2, indicationsof liquid dripping constituting a leak under andSection; 61.242-2.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Leaks also include events regulated under andSection; 61.65(b)(8)(i)for detection of ambient concentrations in excess of background concentrations.A relief valve discharge is not a leak.(x) <T3>Exhaust gas </T3>means any offgas (the constituents of which may consistof any fluids, either as a liquid and/or gas) discharged directly or ultimatelyto the atmosphere that was initially contained in or was in direct contactwith the equipment for which exhaust gas limits are prescribed in andSection;61.62 (a) and (b); andSection; 61.63(a); andSection; 61.64 (a)(1), (b), (c),and (d); andSection; 61.65 (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(5), (b)(6)(ii),(b)(7) and (b)(9)(ii); and andSection; 61.65(d). A leak as defined in paragraph(w) of this section is not an exhaust gas. Equipment which contains exhaustgas is subject to andSection; 61.65(b)(8), whether or not that equipmentcontains 10 percent by volume vinyl chloride. (y) <T3>Relief Valve Discharge </T3>means any nonleak discharge through a reliefvalve. (z) <T3>3-hour period </T3>means any three consecutive 1-hour periods (eachcommencing on the hour), provided that the number of 3-hour periods duringwhich the vinyl chloride concentration exceeds 10 ppm does not exceed thenumber of 1-hour periods during which the vinyl chloride concentrationexceeds 10 ppm.3. Section 61.65 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b)(6) introductorytext, and adding paragraph (d) to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 61.65 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Emission standard for ethylene dichloride, vinyl chloride and polyvinylchloride plants. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(a) <T3>Relief valve discharge. </T3>Except for an emergency relief discharge,and except as provided in andSection; 61.65(d), there is to be no dischargeto the atmosphere from any relief valve on any equipment in vinyl chlorideservice. An emergency relief discharge means a discharge which could nothave been avoided by taking measures to prevent the discharge. Within 10days of any relief valve discharge, except for those subject to andSection;61.65(d), the owner or operator of the source from which the relief valvedischarge occurs shall submit to the Administrator a report in writingcontaining information on the source, nature and cause of the discharge,the date and time of the discharge, the approximate total vinyl chlorideloss during the discharge, the method used for determining the vinyl chlorideloss (the calculation of the vinyl chloride loss), the action that wastaken to prevent the discharge, and measures adopted to prevent futuredischarges. (b) * * * (6) <T3>Opening of equipment. </T3>Vinyl chloride emissions from opening ofequipment (excluding crude, intermediate, and final EDC storage tanks,but including prepolymerization reactors used in the manufacture of bulkresins and loading or unloading lines that are not opened to the atmosphereafter each loading or unloading operation) are to be minimized as follows:<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(d) A RVD that is ducted to a control device that is continually operatingwhile emissions from the release are present at the device is subject tothe following requirements: (1) A discharge from a control device other than a flare shall not exceed10 ppm (average over a 3-hour period) as determined by the continuous emissionmonitor system required under andSection; 61.68. Such a discharge is subjectto the requirements of andSection; 61.70. (2) For a discharge routed to a flare, the flare shall comply with therequirements of andSection; 60.18. (i) Flare operations shall be monitored in accordance with the requirementsof andSection;andSection; 60.18(d) and 60.18(f)(2). For the purposes of andSection;60.18(d), the volume and component concentration of each relief valve dischargeshall be estimated and calculations shall be made to verify ongoing compliancewith the design and operating requirements of andSection;andSection; 60.18(c)(3) through (c)(6). If more than one relief valve is discharged simultaneouslyto a single flare, these calculations shall account for the cumulativeeffect of all such relief valve discharges. These calculations shall bemade and reported quarterly for all discharges within the quarter. Failureto comply with any of the requirements of this paragraph will be a violationof andSection; 61.65(d)(2). Monitoring for the presence of a flare pilotflame shall be conducted in accordance with andSection; 60.18(f)(2). If theresults of this monitoring or any other information shows that the pilotflame is not present 100 percent of the time during which a relief valvedischarge is routed to the flare, the relief valve discharge is subjectto the provisions of andSection; 61.65(a). (ii) A report describing the flare design shall be provided to the Administratornot later than 90 days after the adoption of this provision or within 30days of the installation of a flare system for control of relief valvedischarge whichever is later. The flare design report shall include calculationsbased upon expected relief valve discharge component concentrations andnet heating values (for PVC this calculation shall be based on values expectedif a release occurred at the instant the polymerization starts); and estimatedmaximum exit velocities based upon the design throat capacity of the gasin the relief valve.4. Section 61.68 is amended by revising the first sentence in paragraph(b) to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 61.68 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Emission monitoring. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(b) The vinyl chloride monitoring system(s) used to meet the requirementin paragraph (a) of this section is to be a device which obtains representativesamples from one or more applicable emission points on a continuous sequentialbasis and analyzes the samples with gas chromotography or, if the owneror operator assumes that all hydrocarbons measured are vinyl chloride,with infrared spectrophotometry, flame ion detection, or an alternativemethod. * * * <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>5. Section 61.242-2 of subpart V is amended by revising paragraph (d) introductorytext, (d)(5) and (d)(6) and by adding paragraphs (d)(4) (i), (ii) and (iii)to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 61.242-2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Standards: Pumps. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(d) Each pump equipped with a dual mechanical seal system that includesa barrier fluid system is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a)and (b) of this section, provided the following requirements are met: (4) * * * (i) If there are indications of liquid dripping from the pump seal at thetime of the weekly inspection, the pump shall be monitored as specifiedin andSection; 61.245 to determine the presence of VOC and VHAP in the barrierfluid. (ii) If the monitor reading (taking into account any background readings)indicates the presence of VHAP, a leak is detected. For the purpose ofthis paragraph, the monitor may be calibrated with VHAP, or may employa gas chromatography column to limit the response of the monitor to VHAP,at the option of the owner or operator. (iii) If an instrument reading of 10,000 ppm or greater (total VOC) ismeasured, a leak is detected. (5) Each sensor as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section is checkeddaily or is equipped with an audible alarm. (6)(i) The owner or operator determines, based on design considerationsand operating experience, criteria applicable to the presence and frequencyof drips and to the sensor that indicates failure of the seal system, thebarrier fluid system, or both. (ii) If indications of liquids dripping from the pump seal exceed the criteriaestablished in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, or if, based on thecriteria established in paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, the sensorindicates failure of the seal system, the barrier fluid system, or both,a leak is detected. (iii) When a leak is detected, it shall be repaired as soon as practicable,but not later than 15 calendar days after it is detected, except as providedin andSection; 61.242-10. (iv) A first attempt at repair shall be made no later than five calendardays after each leak is detected. <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-22187 Filed 9-20-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
