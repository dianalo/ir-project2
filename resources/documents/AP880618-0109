We can't feel very comfortable withsomebody running around with Veronica's head, doing God knowswhat,'' David Silberkleit, vice president of marketing or ArchieComic Publications, creator of the cartoon characters.   ``There's an inherent liablity in that these heads are wanderingaround the streets of San Francisco. A person could do weird thingswith these heads,'' he fretted.   The Mamaroneck, N.Y.,-based company is offering a $500 rewardfor information leading to the safe return of the two giant foamrubber heads of Archie Andrews and Veronica Lodge, worth anestimated $2,000 each.   The heads apparently disappeared from the St. Francis-WestinHotel in San Francisco about two weeks ago. They were in town for aperformance at an annual newspaper comic strip awards.   Fortunately, there were two Archie heads and Betty is filling infor Veronica at scheduled appearances.   ``For once in Betty's life she has Archie all to herself,''Silberkleit said.</TEXT></DOC>
