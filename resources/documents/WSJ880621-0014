West Virginia's employment service got 7,000 applications, over half from low-wage workers, for 50 jobs at $6.75 an hour at Du Pont Co.'s Parkersburg plant. Job seekers at an Intel Corp. plant near Albuquerque, N.M., many already having jobs, soared to 500 a day from 500 weekly, on expansion news. Good-paying, secure jobs are scarce, Charles Lehman, of the New Mexico labor department, says; &quot;Some people need to hold a couple of jobs to survive.&quot;    Job applications are rising, as more people try to switch work &quot;even if it's for a few cents an hour more,&quot; says Kathy Zeiger, an Indiana labor analyst. Five million part-time workers, many getting the minimum wage, want full-time jobs, the U.S. Labor Department says; the figure is unusually high for this late in a business boom.    Geologists doing low-wage work in retail stores will be first in line for jobs when a big firm comes to town, an Oklahoma employment service says.    COMPULSIVE GAMBLING may be a handicap, and a shield from firing.    So suggested a federal court in Philadelphia in a case involving an FBI agent who lost $2,000 in Atlantic City, gambling federal funds he was given for an undercover assignment. He went into a treatment program, attends Gamblers Anonymous meetings and stopped gambling. But he was fired a year later because of the incident.    The judge rejected an FBI argument that it didn't discriminate by firing the agent for misusing funds, claiming &quot;pathological gambling&quot; isn't a defense for a crime. Mental-handicap and criminal-responsibility standards are far apart, the judge said. Whether the agent was impaired but qualified to be an FBI agent isn't yet decided.    MEDICARE CHANGES could cut employer costs, but some firms still chafe.    President Reagan is expected to sign a bill to boost &quot;catastrophic&quot; illness benefits for the elderly and disabled; the Medicare rises would trim employers' share of retiree-medical costs. Some firms praise the measure. But a provision that first-year savings be passed on to retirees will mean &quot;a tremendous administrative burden,&quot; says Hewitt Associates, consultants. Savings might not be &quot;worth the effort,&quot; adds Louisville's Barnett Banks.    Clorox Co. sees no &quot;guarantee&quot; the pass-along requirement won't be extended. Barnett Banks and consultants wonder if Congress will later shift more of the cost burden to employers. With retiree Medicare premiums raised to pay for fatter benefits, Mattel Inc. may rethink its policy of reimbursing some premiums.    Some employers consider increasing retirees' private-plan contributions, to offset the Medicare-induced savings pass-through, Hewitt says.    CLEANUP CAMPAIGN: Callaway Community Hospital in Fulton, Mo., pays the Merry Maids service to clean its full-time nurses' homes to help lure nurses from larger hospitals. Nurses &quot;don't like going home with that dirt staring them in the face,&quot; a Callaway official says.    THE HOTTEST JOBS for women this year include hazardous-waste expert, private-label manager, sports marketer, outplacement executive, lobbyist, and physical therapist, says Working Woman. The magazine lists telemarketer, flight attendant, classical dancer, nurse and investment banker as among the worst.    THE NEXT TARGET? The AFL-CIO asks Congress to urge the Labor Department to investigate working conditions at all John Morrell Meatpacking Co. plants. The unions say a third of 2,000 workers at the Sioux Falls, S.D., plant suffered crippling wrist injuries in 1987. The department is inspecting the Sioux Falls facility.    TRAINING FOR TOURISM gets priority in China. As visits surge, China asks the International Labor Organization to set up a center in the city of Suzhou to school 180 teachers in hotel-housekeeping, food-service, travel-agency and other skills. Each instructor will then train 60 persons a year.    FEW EXECUTIVE WOMEN yet know how to play the &quot;corporate game.&quot;    That's the view of an 11-man New York focus group, used by the National Association of Female Executives to glean men's opinions of women in the office workplace. The men concluded: Women are better team players than leaders. They're smart, educated, skilled and hard-working, but haven't learned &quot;strategic thinking&quot; that's needed to climb the business ladder.    Most women, the men say, view their jobs too emotionally, but they improve fast because they react to criticism more personally. The men also believe women see one another as a threat, yet over half the women polled by the association prefer working for women or don't care. Women still are more likely to sacrifice careers for husbands and family, the men say.    Women see significant change, but men's attitudes seem to have hardly changed, an association director says.    THE CHECKOFF: The drought may soon affect hiring by agribusiness, banks and others, as farm income is pinched, warns Personnel Journal . . . Recent pension legislation shows &quot;a level of complexity hitherto known only in the assembly instructions for a barbecue grill,&quot; says Howard C. Weizmann, executive director of the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans . . . Radios are allowed in the workplace by 75% of firms surveyed by TemPositions, a temporary help firm; only 10% permit TVs. </TEXT></DOC>
