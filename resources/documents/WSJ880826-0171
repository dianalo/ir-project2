Sales rose 12% to $83 million.    In the year-earlier quarter, the maker of food-service equipment earned $3.5 million, or 37 cents a share, on sales of $73.9 million.    Specialty Equipment said the second-quarter results reflected a continuation of strong sales to restaurant chains as well as to soft-drink bottlers and equipment dealers.    For the six months, the company's net rose 88% to $12.5 million, or $1.20 a share, from about $6.7 million, or 70 cents a share. Sales rose 16% to $166.2 million from $142.7 million.    The 1987 per-share figures are adjusted to include the 2.5 million new shares sold in the company's initial public offering in July 1987. Specialty Equipment was formed after a leveraged buy-out of several Beatrice Cos. businesses.    As previously reported, the company agreed last month to be acquired in a management buy-out for $33-a-share, or $350 million. The purchase will be accomplished through a tender offer, which is scheduled to expire on Sept. 2. </TEXT></DOC>
