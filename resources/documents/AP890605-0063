Bush told a White House news conference Iran has been aterrorist state. ``As soon as we see some move away from oppressionand extremism of that nature we will review our relationship,'' hesaid.   He described Ali Khamenei as the apparent successor to theAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, indicating the U.S. government mayexpect some jockeying for control. The Iranian president was chosenSunday night by 80 Islamic theologians to succeed Khomeini.   But Bush, when asked who was in charge in Tehran after the deathof the 86-year-old fundamentalist cleric, said ``we're not sureyet.''   ``In a society of that nature, it's hard to predict,'' he said.   Bush was positive, however, about not offering any U.S.incentives to Iran in an attempt to repair the nine-year break inU.S. relations with the Persian Gulf country.   ``No, absolutely not,'' Bush said about any overtures. ``Theyknow what they need to do. They have been a terrorist state.''   Referring to his inaugural speech, Bush said: ``I would simplyrepeat what I said on January 20th, that there's a way for therelationship with the United States to improve and that is for arelease of the American hostages.''   U.S. relations with Iran were broken in April 1980, five monthsafter the U.S. Embassy was overrun and American diplomats, clericalworkers and Marine guards taken hostage.   The action was taken by revolutionaries angered by the supportthe United States had given the toppled Shah Reza Pahlavi. The last52 hostages were released on President Reagan's inaugural day inJanuary 1981 after 444 days in captivity.   In line with the diplomatic break, Americans were cautioned notto travel to Iran and firms were directed not to deal with Iran.Two years ago, after it was discovered that large quantities ofIranian oil that had passed through third parties was reaching theUnited States the ban was made virtually airtight.   Only humanitarian assistance was permitted to go to Iran.   Still, while urging other countries to join the boycott, Reagansecretly approved U.S. weapons shipments to Iran in an effort togain the release of American hostages in Lebanon and to moderatethe Tehran regime.   The State Department's Office for Counter-Terrorism lists nineAmericans as held by Iranian-inspired Shiite Lebanese. Also, Iranis widely suspected of having played a role in the bombing of PanAm Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, last year that killed 270people.   On Sunday, the White House expressed hope that after Khomeini'sdeath Iran would adopt ``a responsible role'' in the worldcommunity.   Former President Carter, who was in the White House when theembassy was seized and then suffered politically by being unable tofree the hostages, offered some conciliatory remarks Sunday outsidehis church in Plains, Ga.   ``I know he was a great hero in his own nation,'' Carter said ofKhomeini, who may have cost the former president any chance ofre-election in 1980. ``My hope is that his successor will be moreinclined toward peace and reconciliation.''</TEXT></DOC>
