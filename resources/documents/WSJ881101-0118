The Nasdaq Composite Index, which opened the month at 387.72, closed at 382.46, down 0.33 from the previous session.    Trading was lackluster. Only 97.9 million shares changed hands. That's 18% below the month's average daily volume of 119.9 million shares. The low volume continues to frustrate traders, who complained that spooked individual investors still are showing little interest in over-the-counter stocks a full year after the market crash.    Budget soared 10 1/8 to 27 1/4 on news that it agreed to be bought by Beech Acquisition, a Beech Holdings unit, for $30 a share. The buy-out pact wasn't a complete surprise. Early last month, Budget retained Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. to explore alternatives for enhancing shareholder value, including a possible sale of the company, and the Chicago-based company's management hired Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. as advisers.    First Executive provided some intrigue. Shares of the insurer, an oft-rumored takeover or leveraged buy-out target, closed up 1 1/2 to 16 3/4 on volume of 2.4 million shares. Traders said the stock's jump caught several short-sellers off guard.    Fred Carr, First Executive's chief executive officer, told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that he couldn't explain the activity and wouldn't comment on whether the company has been approached about being acquired. Goldman Sachs confirmed that it handled several of the large trades of First Executive's shares. But an insurance analyst at the firm said he doesn't follow the stock and hasn't made any comments on it.    Trading in Nasdaq's big technology issues was mixed. Apple Computer rose 1/8 to 38 5/8, while Intel lost 1/8 to close at 24 3/4.    MCI Communications also fell 1/8 to 23 5/8.    Good news helped Fountain Powerboat Industries rebound. The stock rose 1 3/8 to 3 5/8. News of a fire at its Washington, N.C., plant drove the stock down last week. Yesterday, the company said that the fire was limited to the lamination department and that fire walls protected the assembly line from any damage.    Reuter tumbled 1 7/8 to 12 5/8 after it terminated an exclusive agreement to sell and distribute Buhler-Miag equipment used in waste disposal systems involving recycling, refuse-derived fuel and composting.    A number of other stocks reacted to takeover news.    Pioneer Savings Bank plunged 2 1/8 to 4 1/8 and, on the American Stock Exchange, CenTrust Savings Bank dropped 3/8 to 7 1/8. Late Friday, the two companies said they had ended discussions and won't proceed with the previously reported agreement under which CenTrust would have acquired Pioneer.    Medicare-Glaser surged 1 3/8 to 4 5/8. It said it agreed to be acquired by an affiliate of Superx and Alabama Corp. for $6 a share.    Clean Harbors slipped 1 1/2 to 21 1/2, while ChemClear rose 1 to 4 1/2. Clean Harbors agreed to acquire ChemClear for a combination of common stock and cash totaling about $30 million.    Northern Air Freight jumped 2 1/8 to 8 1/4. The company has agreed to be acquired for $9.125 a share by Danzas AG, an international freight-forwarding company based in Basel, Switzerland.    Overall, there were 1,047 Nasdaq decliners and 909 advancers. </TEXT></DOC>
