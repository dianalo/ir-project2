Soybeans, corn and oats ended substantially lower but wheatfinished down only slightly due to a late rebound on news thatChina was seeking 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidizedprices.   And the Agriculture Department's weekly report on graininspections for export, which was released after the close,indicated greater movement of corn last week than expected,analysts said.   The USDA's report that 53.7 million bushels of corn wereinspected last week was ``really quite favorable,'' said DaleGustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.   ``It was surprisingly good in light of the light vessel count wesaw at Gulf,'' he said.   Soybean prices retreated on reports of fairly heavy weekendshowers in Brazil and forecasts for more rain by midweek in bothBrazil and Argentina, Gustafson said.   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 4\ cents lower withDecember at $4.17{ a bushel; corn was unchanged to 4} cents lowerwith December at $2.79 a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 5{ centslower with December at $2.44} a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to10} cents lower with November at $7.64} a bushel</TEXT></DOC>
