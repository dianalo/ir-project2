Thethree components are the continuous miner itself, the roof bolting system,and the coal haulage system. At the present time, both bolting and haulageseem to carry some part of the stigma for limiting productivity, dependingon the particular mine operations. Automation of the bolting cycle offersthe potential not only to substantially reduce bolting delays, but toprovide additional productivity and safety gains through reduction ofcrew size and delivery of more consistent bolting performance. The productivitygains to be obtained from automated bolting are assessed using time studydata and performance projections based on empirical and design data.Technical details and operating characteristics of the automated roofbolter concept are reviewed.</TEXT></DOC>
