That could be Minneapolis.'''   Mondale was vice president under Jimmy Carter from 1980 to 1984and the unsuccessful Democratic candidate in the 1984 presidentialelection.   He and Jan Carnogursky, the deputy premier of Czechoslovakia,are among the 65-member international delegation in Hungary toobserve voting Sunday in Hungary's first free national election in43 years.   Carnogursky said his country, which in June holds its first freeelection in more than four decades, could learn from the Hungarianprocess.   ``We expect nothing unusual to disturb the democratic processSunday,'' Carnogursky said.   Mondale said a ``dark streak'' in pre-Communist Hungarianpolitics _ anti-Semitism and ethnic intolerance _ showed up in somecampaigning.   ``There has been some language used by some politicans that someconsider signals'' of religious and racial intolerance, Mondalesaid.   He refused to go into details, saying only that politicians ofleading parties ``admit it's around, but they do not think it'sgoing to be a basic determinant.''   ``All the party leaders we talked to are clearly trying to avoidthat historic mistake that cursed not only Hungarian politics butEastern European politics for so long,'' said Mondale.   Sponsors of the delegation's visit are the National DemocraticInstitute and the National Republican Institute, organizations ofthe U.S. political parties.   Delegation members plan to tour polling stations and talk tovoters on Sunday as part of the monitoring process. The twoinstitutes have sponsored similar delegations to observe electionsin Haiti, Nicaragua, Panama, the Philippines and elsewhere, andplan to send missions to other Soviet bloc countries planningelections.   Both U.S. parties sent delegations to Hungary during thecampaign to instruct the country's fledgling political parties inthe art of electioneering, unknown in Hungary since 1947.   While the monthlong official campaign featured TV advertising,debates, and posters plastered across towns and villages, it lackedmailing lists and other super-sophisticated techniques of U.S.presidential or congressional contests.</TEXT></DOC>
