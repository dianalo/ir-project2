The Treasury, in a letter dated last Tuesday, informedPhiladelphia-based Bell Atlantic that it believes a BellAtlantic subsidiary, Chesapeake andamp; Potomac Telephone Co., made&quot;material misrepresentations&quot; in a bid for a $100 millioncontract to modernize the Treasury's telephone system in theWashington area. American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. also isbidding for the work, in the latest of a series of bittercontests to update the federal government's phone systemafter the breakup of the old Bell system.</LP><TEXT>   A Treasury spokesman said the allegations ofmisrepresentation had been forwarded to the agency'sinspector general for an investigation. Until theinvestigation is completed, Bell Atlantic is barred fromreceiving future contracts from any federal agency.   It's unclear how the ban will affect Bell Atlantic, whichestimates its revenue from the federal government at morethan $250 million annually. Bell Atlantic is set to beginservice this week on a telephone contract, valued at tens ofmillions of dollars annually, to hook Washington-area federalagencies together. The telecommunications company also haswon a big Pentagon telephone contract, but that award isbeing appealed.   Bell Atlantic denounced the Treasury decision as showing&quot;clear bias&quot; in favor of ATandamp;T. It also accused the agency oftrying to &quot;eliminate Candamp;P {Chesapeake andamp; Potomac} from thebidding.&quot; The Treasury denied any bias; ATandamp;T declinedcomment.   The allegations of misrepresentation focus on whether BellAtlantic based its bid on telecommunications equipment thatwasn't &quot;commercially available,&quot; as required by the Treasury.Bell Atlantic said it had successfully challenged twoattempts by the Treasury to award the contract to ATandamp;T bymaking the same allegations -- that ATandamp;T hadn't usedcommercially available equipment.   The Treasury telephone contract was supposed to have beenawarded in 1987, but is now three years behind schedulebecause of the wrangling between Bell Atlantic and its formerparent, ATandamp;T. The latest Treasury decision will delay theaward at least until the end of the inspector general'sinvestigation. If history is any guide, the final contractaward will probably be challenged by the loser.</TEXT></DOC>
