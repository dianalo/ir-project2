The cable group, which released its own survey yesterday, is on the defensive following charges by broadcasters that cable systems abuse their power to dictate what programs and stations are available to television viewers.    The fight between the broadcasters and cable operators stems from a wider debate over whether the cable industry, which has been broadly deregulated in recent years, should be subject to new and more stringent regulation. At issue in this particular battle are the Federal Communications Commission's so-called must-carry rules. The rules, which require cable systems to carry all local broadcast signals, were declared unconstitutional by a U.S. Court of Appeals last December.    The cable industry says new rules aren't necessary; broadcasters are urging Congress to restore the rules and to regulate the cable industry's ability to move stations from one channel to another. At the request of four congressmen, the FCC surveyed broadcasters, and earlier this month released a study that indicated 20% of cable systems responding had dropped or denied carriage to a broadcast station, and 30% of the broadcasters responding had been dropped by a cable system.    The National Cable Television Association, meanwhile, commissioned Price Waterhouse andamp; Co. to do its own survey, claiming that the FCC's methodology and its conclusions were invalid for a number of technical reasons. A spokesman for the FCC said officials hadn't reviewed the material and thus hadn't any immediate comment.    According to the trade group's study released yesterday, cable television systems continued to carry 98% of all of the local broadcasting stations in their service areas after the must-carry rules were struck down in December.    The study also said 91% of responding cable operators haven't moved any broadcast station to a different channel.    The NCTA's report also contradicts findings of a more informal study by the Association of Independent Television Stations, or INTV, which represents 310 independent television stations. That group's survey said 43 of its member stations have been dropped or moved to less desirable channel positions by cable systems. The broadcast trade group also said its 43 case studies show that &quot;without proper marketplace controls or government regulation, cable systems would use their monopoly power to unfairly disadvantage local stations.&quot;    But the cable industry maintains that it has acted responsibly since the rules were dropped. &quot;Virtually all cable operators continue to carry all local stations, even though they are not legally required to do so,&quot; said James Mooney, president of NCTA, the cable trade group. &quot;Local stations remain highly valuable sources of programming for cable operators.&quot;    The NCTA said it commissioned its survey shortly after the FCC began its study. The cable trade group said it had several concerns about the design and scope of the FCC survey; in particular, the cable operators said the FCC based its survey on rules that were in effect prior to 1985 rather than on more recent rules in effect between 1985 and 1987.    The NCTA said its study, based on the more recent rules, showed only 330 cases where a cable operator either dropped or opted not to carry a station that qualified for carriage under the rules. But the group said respondents cited 310 instances where qualified stations were actually added to cable systems.    A spokesman for the independent broadcasters' group criticized the NCTA's survey for drawing a limited number of respondents; the responses represent 47% of all cable systems serving 70% of all cable subscribers. &quot;If less than half the cable systems responded, you could be open to charges that maybe the systems with the most egregious cases didn't even answer the questionnaire,&quot; the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
