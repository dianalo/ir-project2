Pierce's actions, detailed in Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment files released Thursday, suggest that at least on thisoccasion, Pierce took a more active role than he has acknowledgedin helping those who sought his aid.   In a handwritten instruction to top aide Deborah Gore Dean,Pierce asked her to ``check into this and try to get it through.''   The documents also show that then-Defense Secretary CasparWeinberger wrote Pierce to back a development seeking HUDfinancing. On another occasion, records show that Carla Hills,herself a former HUD secretary and now the Bush administration'stop trade official, got Pierce to overrule deputies in favor of herclients.   HUD released more than 20,000 pages from the files of Dean, alsoa key figure in investigations of fraud, mismanagement andinfluence-peddling at the agency during the Reagan administration.   Pierce, Dean and her predecessor as his top aide, Lance Wilson,all have invoked their Fifth Amendment rights and refused totestify before a House subcommittee investigating the agency.   The records, released under the Freedom of Information Act,provide fresh evidence of the considerable power Dean wielded atHUD and of the persistent lobbying she faced from developers,consultants, members of Congress and local elected officials.   The documents concerning the New York project appear tocontradict Pierce's May testimony, in which he said he often waslobbied by friends and political associates but never assisted thembeyond asking staffers to give the projects ``carefulconsideration.''   The New York project was mentioned in a 1985 handwritten note toPierce from the Commerce Department's assistant secretary forproductivity, technology and innovation, urging HUD to back aproposed project in Manhattan near Columbia University.   The note to Pierce was signed ``Bruce'' on stationery of theassistant secretary of commerce. D. Bruce Merrifield, who held thatposition at the time, could not be reached in calls to his home orthe company where he is a consultant.   The 99-unit senior-citizen housing project was granted $1.2million in rental subsidies, according to Francine Kellman,spokeswoman for the HUD New York regional office.   Pierce's attorney, Paul L. Perito, said he had not seen theletter to Pierce and was not familiar with the project. But he saidthere was ``nothing incriminatory in that situation'' and thatPierce ``has never asked anyone to deviate from responsible,professional government standards.''   On another occasion, documents showed that after a privateresearch company wrote Pierce to complain that several of its bidsfor HUD work had been rejected, the secretary wrote to Dean:``Let's try to help this fellow. I think he and his company havebeen unfairly treated.''   It could not be immediately determined whether that firm latergot HUD work.   Weinberger's name surfaced on two September 1983 notes by Pierceaides discussing a project ``Cap'' had recommended to Pierce. Oneaide noted the project was denied funding through normal channelsbut ``will be a good candidate for the secretary's discretionaryfund.'' It could not be immediately determined whether the projectwas ultimately given HUD money.   Mrs. Hills appealed to Pierce in 1985 after a California clienttrying to sell a HUD-mortgaged development was told it would haveto pay $1.3 million into reserve accounts before the deal could beapproved. Mrs. Hills asked Pierce to reduce the amount to $855,000and, after Dean endorsed the idea, approved the reduction.   Some of the documents in Dean's files show:   _She once rewrote a draft of a Reagan speech the White House hadprepared for the president's appearance with Pierce at anelementary school. ``Please excuse our crassness,'' she said in anote to the White House accompanying her revised version.   _In a handwritten note to Pierce, Ms. Dean said the department'sOffice of General Counsel ``can find no document that says you haveever delegated authority over Mod Rehab to anyone.''   The Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program was found by thedepartment's inspector general to have been to be riddled withpolitical influence; Pierce has said he delegated the power toaward the lucrative subsidies to a three-member committee thatincluded Dean.   _Dean was the guest at numerous receptions held by people andorganizations that dealt with HUD, and was guest of honor at aFebruary 1985 gathering hosted by a Hasidic group called theOpportunity Development Association. Three weeks later the groupwas awarded 150 federally subsidized housing units in Brooklyn.</TEXT></DOC>
