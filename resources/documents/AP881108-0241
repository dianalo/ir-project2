The possible sale of the food businesses, which last yearaccounted for about 60 percent of the company's $15.8 billion in netsales, was announced Monday by the special committee appointed bythe board to evaluate the unprecedented multibillion-dollar buyoutoffers already made for RJR Nabisco.   The committee also said it had set a Nov. 18 deadline forsubmission of any proposals to acquire either the entire company orjust its tobacco businesses, and warned bidders that it would notconsider their offers if they did not agree to the terms it set forthe auction.   RJR Nabisco already is the target of a record $20.3 billiontender offer _ worth $90 a share _ by the New York investment firmKohlberg Kravis Roberts Inc. and a rival proposal by Nabiscomanagement to acquire the company for $20.7 billion, or $92 a share.   The New York buyout firm Forstmann Little andamp; Co. announced lastweek it led an investor group _ including consumer products giantProcter andamp; Gamble Co., the investment firm Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. andRalston Purina Co. _ interested in a possible counteroffer thatwould surpass both existing bids.   RJR stock rose $1.75 a share to $87.37{ in New York StockExchange composite trading on Monday.   The special committee said that if the board decided to sellRJR's food businesses, the after-tax proceeds would be paid toshareholders before any acquisition of RJR.   ``Accordingly, parties are invited to submit proposals on a basiswhich, in effect, would involve acquiring RJR Nabisco as astand-alone tobacco company,'' the committee stated.   Furthermore, the committee has ordered its financial advisers toexplore available alternatives other than a buyout of the company.   Industry analysts have estimated RJR Nabisco's food businesseswould bring a sale price ranging from $12.5 billion to $15.5 billion.   Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco makes such well-known brands as Winstonand Camel cigarettes, Oreo cookies and Del Monte vegetables.   The committee said it had made no final decision on whether tosell the company or any of its parts, and that the board had decidedto take no position on the pending tender offer by Kohlberg Kravis.   In addition, the committee stated it was inviting the inclusionin bids of a ``substantial common stock-related equity component.''The panel's announcement did not elaborate on the reasons for therequest, although including stock in their offers would enablebidders to increase the value of their bids without having to comeup with more cash.   The panel also warned that it would consider any attempt to bidfor the company outside of its guidelines would be considered ahostile overture, and neither the special committee nor the boardwould consider offers from any bidders that had not agreed to thoseterms.   A buyout of the RJR Nabisco food businesses would mirror therecent trend that has seen the acquisitions and sometimes breakingup of the nation's biggest food companies.   Last month, Kraft Inc. agreed to be acquired by food and tobaccogiant Philip Morris Companies Inc. in a $13.1 billion buyout, thesecond-biggest U.S. corporate acquisition ever. There also is abattle being waged by Pillsbury Co. against a $5.2 billion hostilebuyout offer by Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC, a food, liquor andreal estate conglomerate.   The big food companies are considered attractive because of theirestablished brand names and relative steady businesses, which areregarded as recession proof.</TEXT></DOC>
