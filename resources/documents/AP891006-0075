(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Although damage estimates in the wake ofHurricane Hugo were hiked upward to more than $4 billion, thereturn of carriage rides and parking tickets are signs thathistoric Charleston is trying to get back to normal.   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said the city had made an ``absolutelyremarkable'' recovery in two weeks since the hurricane lashed thecity with its 135 mph winds.   ``The city is open, the curfew is over and we invite the peopleof the state and the country to come to Charleston,'' Riley said.But he noted that the recovery will take longer for those who losthomes, possessions or jobs in the hurricane.   Horse-drawn carriages were to be back on the streets thisweekend and the city will start ticketing parking violators onMonday, the mayor said.   Meanwhile, the Ben Sawyer Bridge _ the only link between themainland and the Isle of Palms and Sullivans Island about 10 milesnorth of Charleston _ is back in place, said Carol Todd,spokeswoman for the Army Corps of Engineers.   She said the corps finished its work about 2 a.m. today, butthat she does not know when the swing bridge will open to traffic.Officials from the state Highway Department were inspecting thebridge this morning, she said.   The bridge _ one end of which was submerged in the IntracoastalWaterway by Hugo's winds _ was lifted onto barges Wednesday. But abroken cable prevented the barges from positioning the bridge backon the road before today.   Hugo hit the coast Sept. 21, leaving at least 18 dead in SouthCarolina, and damaging and destroying homes, businesses, schoolsand municipal buildings. In all, 29 people were killed on the U.S.mainland and at least 33 in the Caribbean.   Gov. Carroll Campbell said Thursday that damage from the stormwas revised upward to $4 billion to $5 billion. Previous estimateshad been closer to $3 billion.   State and local governments would pick up about 25 percent ofthe $200 million cleanup cost with the federal government coveringthe rest.   The state highway commission suggested a 1-cent increase in thegasoline tax to help pay for the cleanup, but Campbell said hewould first shift funds from other programs before increasing taxes.   Riley, who had asked Campbell to request Army troops to helpclear debris, said Thursday he wrote to President Bush himself whenthe governor rejected the idea.   In a letter to Campbell, Riley and two other mayors said thestate has been inundated with as much debris as one might expect tocollect over 50 years. They said private contractors could not meetthe cleanup demand and local governments couldn't afford to paythem.   But Campbell said the cities can still contract with privatecontractors and would have to pay 12 percent of the cost.   Also Thursday, National Hurricane Center Director Bob Sheetssaid damage from the storm could have been halved had coastalstructures been built to the tougher hurricane building codes ofsouth Florida.   ``The extent of the damage is far more widespread than I've seenfrom any previous hurricane,'' said Sheets, in the state to tourstorm damage.   Workers used bulldozers to rebuild dunes along beaches scarredby the hurricane. Private contractors were supported by 550 Armytroops and Marines using 100 dump trucks to haul sand to build upeight miles of beach in Myrtle Beach.   Tides at least 2 feet above normal are expected along the coastfrom Oct. 14-18 caused by the moon coming unusually close to theEarth, said Ms. Todd.   Campbell hopes to have 65 miles of dunes rebuilt along thestate's northern coastline before the high tides hit.</TEXT></DOC>
