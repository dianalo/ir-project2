At the moment, when information in one language istransmitted to a computer using software designed for anotherlanguage many of the characters can be misinterpreted.</LP><TEXT>   For instance, accents in French might be dropped or Arabiccharacters or Chinese ideographs might be turned intogobbledygook. But the agreement -- announced by such majorcompanies as International Business Machines Corp., MicrosoftCorp., Apple Computer Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc., XeroxCorp. and Metaphor Computer Systems Inc. -- will get aroundthat problem by setting a standard for ways to provide moreinformation on each character.   There will be a cost. To specify a character, programerswill have to use 16 bits of computer memory rather than thecustomary eight. That means computers may require more memoryin the future. In addition, most of the software in use todaywon't be fully compatible with the new standard.   However, the developers said the standard should removemany of the headaches that users face in transmittinginformation among countries. The developers also said thestandard should end many of the problems they face in takingsoftware written for use in one language and making it usablein other languages.</TEXT></DOC>
