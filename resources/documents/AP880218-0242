A final agreement between Petromin, the Saudi Arabian oilholding arm, and Texaco is expected to be reached within a month,the Herald Tribune reported Thursday, quoting an unidentifiedTexaco executive and unidentified Arab oil executives attending anannual conference of the Institute of Petroleum in London.   In White Plains, N.Y., a spokesman at Texaco's headquartersrefused to confirm or deny the accuracy of the report.   ``On Jan. 8, Texaco announced as part of its restructuring planthat it would aggressively move foward to get partners in jointventures based on its downstream operations,'' said K. PeterManeri. ``At this stage, it would be inappropriate to issue publicstatement regarding those discussions.''   Saudi Arabia has been considering taking a large stake in therefining and marketing arms of one of the U.S. major oil companieswhich were once shareholders in the Arabian American Oil Co., orAramco, oil industry officials said.   Those companies are Chevron Corp., Exxon Corp. Mobil Corp., andTexaco.   Over the past few months, all four companies have been givenpreferential access to Saudi Arabia's crude oil at market-relatedprices, which are below officials prices, while most othercompanies have had to pay official prices for the oil.   Texaco has been the largest single buyer of Saudi crude oil forthe past year, oil industry sources said.   Texaco announced its restructuring program as part of its planfor emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.   The nation's third-largest oil company hopes to complete thatmove in April, one year after it filed for protection from itscreditors to avoid having to post a potentially ruinous bond whileappealing a $10.3 billion judgement held against the company byPennzoil Co.   A Houston jury awarded the judgement to Pennzoil after rulingthat Texaco had improperly interfere with a Pennzoil plan toacquire part of Getty Oil Co. and acquired Getty itself.   As part of its proposed reorganization plan, Texaco agreed tosettle the case by paying Pennzoil $3 billion in cash.</TEXT></DOC>
