Adjusting for equipment changes, Chrysler said its car prices will rise an average of about 2.3%. Auto makers traditionally add standard equipment to minimize the impact of a price increase.    The rise is well above the average annual price increase of 1% during the past three years and is consistent with statements from Chrysler officials that the company can't afford to sacrifice profits for market share.    Chrysler is the first of the Big Three to unveil tentative 1989 prices. Ford Motor Co., which is building nearly as many cars and trucks as it can sell, told dealers last week to expect 1989-model price increases of about 3%. General Motors Corp. is expected to announce its 1989 prices later this month. Chrysler likely won't finalize its 1989 prices until GM and Ford make their moves.    Last month, Chrysler informed dealers through fleet prices that 1989 models would probably cost 3% to 5% more. Signals of higher 1989 prices grew even stronger two weeks ago when Chrysler's second-quarter earnings fell 24% and Chairman Lee A. Iacocca indicated price increases might be necessary to improve profits.    One significant cost consumers won't see, at least not directly, is the expense of airbags that Chrysler will begin installing as standard equipment in about 25% of its domestically built 1989 models. But company officials stopped short of saying Chrysler will swallow those costs in the 1990 model year, when it expects to have the safety feature in all domestically built cars. Chrysler officials declined to disclose the cost of the airbags, but customers buying other companies' airbag-equipped cars can pay up to $800 for the feature.    Chrysler declined to say whether tentative base prices also will increase across its 1989 truck line-up. Chrysler's truck pricing is important because light trucks account for at least 70% of the company's profits. Company officials did say the 1989 base price on a version of its minivan, its best-selling light truck, will jump 3.9%.    The biggest increases mainly affect Chrysler's least-expensive models, which experienced a price decrease a year ago as the company started its drive to gain market share. The company said the base price of the 1989-model Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon subcompacts will go up $500, or 8.3%, to $6,495. The Dodge Aries and Plymouth Reliant K-body compacts also will increase by $500, or 7.1%, to $7,495.    When the 1988 models came out last year, Chrysler trumpeted its plans to lower prices on those models. The base price of Aries and Reliant, for example, dropped by $1,400. But the strategy backfired.    &quot;We felt customers would be able to see we had the least-expensive vehicles around and they wouldn't have to go on sale,&quot; said Omar Matt, manager of Chrysler's pricing and competitive analysis. &quot;Instead, it turned out that people still wanted some rebates on the cars. We got stuck underpricing the car and giving out incentives.&quot;    The steepest car-price increase was the 11.2% base-price rise on the 1989-model Dodge Dynasty LE, which is tentatively priced to start at $13,595. Part of the increase reflects new standard equipment including an electronic automatic transaxle and V-6 engine.    Chrysler froze the base price of the Chrysler New Yorker, which starts at $17,416, and that of the Jeep Wrangler S, which starts at $8,995. Chrysler officials said they think New Yorker can gain ground against GM's Buick, Oldsmobile and Cadillac large and luxury vehicles. They also believe Wrangler can pick up some sales from sport utility buyers concerned about the safety of Suzuki Motor Co.'s Samurai model. </TEXT></DOC>
