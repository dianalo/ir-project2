It was a Friday afternoon and Florio, the president and chiefexecutive of New Yorker Magazine Inc., called to discuss some minorchanges in an ad layout.   He asked for Arthur Einstein Jr., a founding partner at thehighly regarded agency that has been making New Yorker ads for 17years.   Einstein wasn't there. ``His secretary told me Arthur and DickLord had resigned _ that six of them had walked out,'' Florio said.   The walkout on March 18 was followed by other defections, andwithin a week Florio had decided he would drop Lord Geller as hisad agency. Other clients, including giant International BusinessMachines Corp., said they are reassessing the situation, too.   The events have been the talk of Madison Avenue, where businessand personal relations often seem inextricably bound.   Einstein said he and his five colleagues left to start a newagency because they felt they couldn't operate as they wanted tounder the management of WPP Group PLC, which acquired Lord Gellerlast summer.   Since the six top executives left, an estimated 30 of LordGeller's 325 employees have quit, some joining their old colleaguesat a new agency called Lord, Einstein, O'Neill andamp; Partners.   Lord Geller has gone to court, charging that the departedexecutives breached fiduciary duties and conspired to take businessfrom the agency. The firm asks that the defectors be enjoined fromsoliciting Lord Geller clients and employees. A state Supreme Courthearing has been set for Monday.   WPP, which is headed by the financially-adept Martin Sorrell,bought Lord Geller as part of its $566 million purchase in July1987 of JWT Group Inc., which also owned the advertising giant J.Walter Thompson Co.   Lord Geller and J. Walter Thompson had been operatedindependently since Lord Geller was acquired by Thompson in 1974.   Einstein said he and his partners grew increasingly disaffectedunder WPP's ownership, but Sorrell refused to discuss selling theagency to them.   They objected to WPP's reported plans to set up a network ofagencies in Europe that could boast an affiliation with Lord Geller.   They bristled when Sorrell prohibited Lord Geller from competingfor General Motors Corp.'s new Saturn automobile account,reportedly for fear of offending Ford Motor Co., J. WalterThompson's biggest client.   The New Yorker's Florio said Einstein had never mentioned thathe and his colleagues were having problems under WPP management.After being told Einstein had left the agency, Florio said, hephoned Einstein and told him that he wanted to continue workingwith him.   Sorrell stopped by on Monday to talk with Florio and asked himto defer a decision on moving the account because two respectedadmakers, Dick Thomas and Chuck Griffith, would be staying on it.   But when Florio called Griffith the next day to discuss thechanges he had in mind for the ad, he was told Griffith ``had leftfor good.''   He asked for Thomas, was switched over and then told Thomas had``left the agency an hour ago.''   Florio asked to talk with Sorrell, who told him there wereplenty of talented people at the agency to get the ad done. ButFlorio didn't like the idea that you could ``just slap somebody onthe account,'' and told Sorrell to ``freeze my campaign for thetime being.''   Florio said he was now genuinely worried about the ad deadline,and called the Lord Geller executive who normally placed the NewYorker ads. He was told she had left the agency as well.   ``All the creative people and the media people that I had dealtwith had resigned. I literally don't know anybody there,'' Floriosaid.   On Friday, Florio said he planned to send a letter next weekdismissing the agency and would take the account to Lord Einstein.   The New Yorker is a relatively small account, spending about$1.5 million on advertising this year. Lord Geller handles billingsof about $245 million a year, which in turn is dwarfed by the $3.2billion that Thompson bills.   The walkout touched off a scramble by other agencies for LordGeller's accounts. Florio said he heard from six other agencies inthe past week.   Jerry Della Femina, who heads Della Femina Travisano andamp; Partners,is among them. He bets most clients won't move to the new agencygiven the legal challenges that Lord Geller has raised.   Della Femina said some Lord Geller clients may say ``a plague onboth their houses'' and look for a new agency.</TEXT></DOC>
