The index had lost 405.34points Friday; the market was closed Monday for a nationalholiday.   In early trading Wednesday, the Nikkei Index was up 26.42to 23794.30.   Volume on the first section Tuesday was estimated at ameager 210 million shares, down from 350 million sharesFriday. Declining issues outnumbered gainers 860 to 131,while 84 issues remained unchanged.   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first-section issues,which fell 30.55 points Friday, dropped a further 39.65points, or 2.2%, to 1725.17.   The Second Section Index, which gave up 41.63 pointsFriday, declined 46.40 points, or 1.7%, to close at 2735.24.Turnover on the second section was estimated at six millionshares, thinning from 8.5 million shares Friday.   Comments on the day's trading ranged from &quot;totallyincoherent&quot; as dealers repeatedly covered positions purely ontechnical factors, to &quot;deathly dull&quot; as brokerage-houseactivity dried up because of the yen's weakness and generalholiday sluggishness.   With so few players in the market, the impact of any movewas magnified. The Nikkei dropped about 250 points earlymorning on selling by brokerage houses and then stabilizeduntil just before the close.   Leftover profit-taking on the market's early-Decemberrally picked up toward the end of the day, causing the indexto close at its low for the day. Judging by the Nikkei, themarket rallied nearly 14% this month before hittingprofit-taking.   Selling related to concerns about Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard Shevardnadze's resignation last week also continued todamp sentiment Tuesday.   Traders said the yen's weakening against the dollarfollowing the Shevardnadze news is one concern keepinginstitutional investors on the sidelines. The greenback,traditionally seen as a safe investment in times of turmoil,rose sharply in the wake of Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation.Traders said they see further weakness ahead for the Japanesecurrency, particularly in light of the Persian Gulf crisis.   Although long-term interest rates, such as the yield onthe Japanese government long bond, have come down sharply inthe past few weeks, short-term rates are still high. Tradersreiterated Tuesday that unless the Bank of Japan relaxesmonetary policy, the stock market is unlikely to show muchstrength.   Japan's three long-term credit banks will lower thelong-term prime lending rate in January by 0.3 percentagepoints to 7.8%, a spokesman at one of the banks said. Buttraders said the move won't have much impact on stock pricesunless the central bank subsequently eases credit.   Shipbuilding, steel, construction, electric power andother issues that appreciated sharply during the market'searly-December rally continued to be pulled lower byprofit-takers Tuesday.   IHI shed 19 yen to 666 yen, Mitsubishi Heavy fell 15 yento 670 yen and Kawasaki Heavy lost 19 yen to 521 yen.   Nippon Steel gave up 8 yen to 437 yen, NKK declined 10 yento 391 yen and Sumitomo Metal lost 9 yen to 448 yen.   Sumitomo Construction fell 58 yen to 721 yen, MaedaConstruction slid 60 yen to 1700 yen and Nippon Hodo tumbled150 yen to 2650 yen. Also lower were Kajima, down 60 yen to1560 yen, Kumagai Gumi, down 35 yen to 752 yen, TokyuConstruction, off 50 yen to 1130 yen.   Tokyo Electric Power fell 100 yen to 3530 yen.   In London, share prices closed lower in thin Christmas Evedealings Monday as further Middle East war talk weakened themarket.   As expected, trading was unusually thin and many bigplayers were absent, starting Christmas holidays early,traders said.   Nevertheless, it was &quot;one of the quietest Christmas Eves&quot;in recent years, a trader commented.   The trader said declines were triggered by weekend PersianGulf rhetoric, with U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheneysuggesting that war was increasingly likely. They said theimpact of his statement was exaggerated by thin marketconditions.   Falls were limited, however, by the pound's slip to$1.8745 from $1.8835 Friday, which helped to buoy someleading international stocks, traders added.   The broad-based Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-ShareIndex closed down 8.1 points at 2156.3.   The narrower FT 30-Share Index closed down 9.5 points at1678.9.   At the final bell, volume was 103.2 million shares. In thefutures markets, the December FT-SE 100-Index contract closed7 points lower at 2,163.0.   Among corporate features, water stocks were firm on demandshortly ahead of their ex-dividend day on Jan. 14.   Thames Water rose 4 pence (7.5 cents) to 270, AnglianWater increased a penny to 271, Severn Trent strengthened 3to 240 and North-West Water rose 2 to 266.   Shares in the recently privatized regional electriccompanies came under selling pressure as personal investorslocked in quick profits. Shareholders were notified in thelast few days about the number of shares they were alloted inthe initial clamor for the issue.   The package of electricity shares declined 40 pence to14.60 pounds.
