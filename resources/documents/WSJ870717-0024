Surveyed FirmsReport Fewer Women Directors---By Amanda BennettStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   Has the push to add women to corporate boards of directors eased? At least one recent survey says so.    When compared with previous surveys of directors, figures compiled by the executive-search firm Korn/Ferry International show that fewer U.S. companies had women on their boards last year than in the recent past. The decline was particularly sharp among banks, which have been leaders in adding women to their boards. Moreover, minority additions to boards of directors appear to have slowed as well.    The latest survey also found that many board chairmen think recent changes in legislation have eased the crisis in liability insurance for corporate directors. Nonetheless, more people are turning down board seats and citing fear of legal liability as the reason.    And despite the rash of public concern in the wake of the recent Wall Street scandals, the survey found that corporate ethics still isn't a high-priority issue for most directors.    The conclusions of the survey of directors are based on responses from 532 companies. About 28% are industrial companies with annual sales over $1 billion; another 25% are banks and insurers. The remainder are smaller industrial concerns, service companies and retail institutions. While the survey's overall findings were released earlier this year, more detailed information, separating out the responses of banks and of large companies, was made available only recently.    According to the survey, 43% of the companies responding said they had women on their boards, down from 45% in 1985. Women held their own on the boards of larger companies, with 51% having female board members, the same as the year before; but that figure is also down from a peak of 53% in 1984.    &quot;The push is off,&quot; says Ann Morrison, co-author of a book about women in senior management. &quot;The momentum is not on automatic.&quot;    Ironically, women may be paying the price of their own success. Jack Steele, chairman of board-recruitment services at Korn/Ferry, says he thinks that the drive to put women into board seats for cosmetic reasons or to placate the government is over, largely because they have become an established presence in the business world. &quot;Ten years ago, I'd get a call saying 'Get me a woman' or 'Get me a black,'&quot; he explains. &quot;Now (such placement) is being done for the right reasons.&quot;    But without that external pressure, the addition of women to boards may keep slowing until the pool of qualified women grows larger. &quot;You won't see a tremendous increase in the numbers for six or seven years, until the pipeline (of able candidates) starts to fill up,&quot; says Felice Schwartz, president of Catalyst Inc., a research organization that promotes working women's issues.    Ms. Schwartz says that Catalyst's figures indicate that more of the largest U.S. corporations have women on their boards. Those figures, however, don't include banks. And while such institutions have long been leaders in adding women to their boards, Korn/Ferry's survey shows them now exhibiting the steepest decline. According to the search firm, 61% of the banks and other financial institutions had women directors, the same as last year but down from a peak of 75% in 1983.    Mary-Liz Meany, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, says that while the trade group doesn't keep figures specifically on directorships, its data indicate a sharp rise in the number of women in bank management generally.    Minorities fared unevenly in the survey. Among respondents with annual sales of more than a billion dollars, 40% had minority directors last year, compared with 31% in 1985. At banks, 53% had minority members, compared with 52% in 1985. Of all companies answering the survey, however, only 30% had minority members on their boards, down from 35% in 1985.    Over the past few years, many companies have had trouble filling board seats with the candidates they want. Some of the most sought-after prospects are the chief executive officers of other major companies. But more and more chief executives are limiting themselves to only one or two board seats rather than four or five. Last year, more than 22% of the respondents said a prospective board member had declined an invitation to serve, compared with about 20% in 1985 and 18% in 1982.    Time was the reason given by 65% of the candidates who refused last year, up from 60% in 1985. The average director reported spending 114 hours a month on such things as review, preparation and travel to attend an average of eight board meetings a year. And the bigger the company, the longer the hours: Directors of companies with more than $5 billion in annual sales spent an average of 153 hours a month on board duties, compared with an average of 94 hours a month for those sitting on the boards of companies with annual sales of under $200 million.    Another reason for reluctance to serve was liability. The past few years have seen a steep increase in the number of lawsuits -- and, more specifically, in successful ones -- by shareholders charging that board members didn't adequately perform their board responsibilities. Of those declining board seats last year, more than 14.2% cited increasing legal liability. In 1985, only 2.5% of the candidates who turned down an offer gave that as their reason.    Legal changes may offer some relief. A recent statute in Delaware, where many companies are incorporated, allows companies to limit or eliminate financial liability for directors if they didn't act in bad faith. In the Korn/Ferry survey, 77% of chief executives said they believe the statute will partly ease the liability problem.    Amid such concerns, directors overall were better paid. In 1986, directors of all companies answering the survey received an average $20,462 in retainer and boardmeeting fees, up 4.7% from the average $19,544 they earned last year. Including fees for serving on special committees, directors' total annual compensation for board duties was $23,676 on average.    The directors surveyed last year had their eyes fixed, as in years past, firmly on the bottom line. Asked what their chief concerns as board members were, more than 85% put financial results among their top three. More than 66% said strategic planning was among their top three choices, with 28.3% choosing financing and capitalization.    Ethics and white-collar crime, on the other hand, apparently don't get much board attention. A bare 0.6% of board members listed those issues among their top three concerns.    &quot;I still think it is a concern of many directors,&quot; says Thomas Horton, president and chief executive of the American Management Association, a nonprofit educational group. But he also notes that &quot;on a day-to-day basis you worry about your operations, you worry about a takeover, you worry about your own skin and you worry about whether you're getting enough information to be a good director.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
