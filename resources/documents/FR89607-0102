Hall, Senior Counsel,Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 FifthStreet, NW., Washington, DC 20549.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Under the Privacy Act of 1974 (the``Act''), 5 U.S.C. 552a, the Commission had designated more than twentyenforcement-related systems of records. These systems of record are maintainedby the Division of Enforcement, the Commission's Records Officer, and theCommission's Regional and Branch Offices. The descriptions of these systemsof records were distinguished primarily by the status of a matter (e.g.,as a matter under inquiry, formal investigation, closed investigation,or by various types of litigation) or by physical location of the records.However, for Privacy Act and other purposes, both the Commission and thepublic normally treat Commission enforcement-related systems of recordsas a single system. For example, individuals who seek to determine whetherthe Commission maintains information concerning them in its enforcementrecords generally do not frame their requests in terms of the status ofa matter or the location of the records, nor does the Commission's PrivacyAct Officer use these categories in responding to requests. The Commissionthus determined that it was appropriate to consolidate these descriptions.\1\<NOTE/> The consolidated description does not expand the categoriesof investigatory or litigation records maintained, the categories of individualson whom such records are maintained, or the potential recipients of suchinformation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ As a result of this consolidation, the descriptions ofthe following systems of records have been revoked: SEC-12_AdministrativeProceedings; SEC-24_Division of Enforcement Investigative Working Files;SEC-25_Division of Enforcement Liaison Working Files; SEC-26_Division ofEnforcement Preliminary Market Surveillance Inquiries; SEC-36_InvestigatoryFiles; SEC-38_Litigation Files (Civil and Criminal); SEC-62_Atlanta RegionalOffice Investigative files; SEC-63_Boston Regional Office InvestigationIndex File; SEC-64_Boston Regional Office Investigative Files; SEC-66_ChicagoRegional Office Investigative Files; SEC-71_Denver Regional Office InvestigativeFiles; SEC-76_Detroit Branch Office Investigative Files; SEC-79_Forth WorthRegional Office Investigative Files; SEC-80_Houston Branch Office InvestigativeFiles; SEC-82_Los Angeles Regional Office Investigative Files; SEC-85_MiamiBranch Office Investigative Files; SEC-87_New York Regional Office InvestigativeFiles; SEC-90_Philadelphia Branch Office Investigative Files; SEC-93_SaltLake City Branch Office Investigative Files; SEC-94_San Francisco BranchOffice Investigative Files; SEC-97_Washington Regional Office InvestigativeFiles; and SEC-99_Washington Regional Office and Philadelphia Office LitigationFiles.The consolidation of enforcement records is not intended to expand theroutine uses that may be made of records under previously-published systemdescriptions, and existing routine uses for records contained in enforcement-relatedsystems of records continue to apply. The Commission has also clarifiedthose uses by adding language that explicitly covers disclosure of recordsto trustees in bankruptcy, in litigation in which the Commission is nota party, and to foreign governmental authorities and foriegn securitiesauthorities.The Commission has a statutory advisory role in proceedings under the BankruptcyCode, <T3>see </T3>11 U.S.C. 1109(a); in meeting its obligations under the BankruptcyCode, the Commission occasionally provides information that is subjectto the Act to bankruptcy trustees. Similarly, the Commission is often requiredto disclose information subject to the Act in response to subpoenas issuedin litigation to which the Commission is not a party. Disclosure underthese circumstances is covered by one or more existing routine uses. Thelanguage added by newly-added Routine Uses 21 and 22 makes that coverageexplicit.The Commission also provides assistance to foreign governmental authoritiesunder several existing routine uses. The Insider Trading and SecuritiesFraud Enforcement Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-704, 102 Stat. 4677, providesexplicitly for investigatory assistance to foreign authorities. In addition,it amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by adding a new section 3(a)(50),which defines the term ``foreign securities authority'' as ``any foreigngovernment, or any governmental body or regulatory organization empoweredby a foreign government to administer or enforce its laws as they relateto securities matters.'' To clarify that assistance may be provided inappropriate cases to foreign governmental authorities, and, specifically,to foreign securities authorities, the Commission is amending existingRoutine Uses 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 11, either by adding specific referencesto foreign securities authorities, or by making other amendments as appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="66">SEC-102</ITAG>SYSTEM NAME:  Enforcement Files.SYSTEM LOCATION:Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington,DC. 20549.
