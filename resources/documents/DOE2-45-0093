The globalimportance of tropical forest soils in the atmospheric carbon cycle andits susceptibility to alteration by human land-management practices impliesthat the solution to the human-induced climate change problem lies ina combination of combustion source controls, conservation of existingtropical rain forests, and large-scale upgrading of productivity on currentlydegraded tropical soils.
