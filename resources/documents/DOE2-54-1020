<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-54-1020 </DOCNO><TEXT>A gas chromatographic headspace method was developed to determine theconcentrations of toluene and ethanol in production fluids resultingfrom the in-situ recovery of bitumen from Athabasca oil sands. Certainadditives being investigated in pilot plant tests contained toluene andethanol, and a knowledge of their distribution in the produced fluidswas required to provide insight into the mechanism of bitumen recovery.A Perkin-Elmer gas chromatograph equipped with a Model HS-6 headspacesampler and flame ionization detector was used. The samples were firstseparated into their constituent phases, a water emulsion and an oilemulsion, and each analyzed separately. Standard addition experimentsperformed on the water emulsion samples indicated that matrix effectswere negligible, and that calibration curves could be prepared simplyusing standard solutions of toluene and ethanol in water. Relative standarddeviations, which include both instrumental and subsampling errors, rangefrom 5 to 13%. 10 refs., 3 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
