Kelly, Beatrice Co.'s chairman, moved nearer to the acquisition hunt he craves by yesterday agreeing to sell Beatrice's Tropicana juice business to Seagram Co   Mr. Kelly's dream is to buy another large company and profitably break it up, as he is doing with Beatrice, sources close to him say. One potential target is rumored to be Pillsbury Co., whose chairman, John M. Stafford, resigned last week after a tenure marked by falling earnings, a sales growth slowdown and the erosion of leadership positions in such moneymakers as pizza and baking mixes.    Mr. Kelly couldn't be reached for comment, and Beatrice officials wouldn't answer questions about Mr. Kelly's plans. But Mr. Kelly said last year that food companies are top candidates to be his targets. Some analysts think he is the best person to buy Pillsbury and sell off its troubled restaurant business, including its troubled Burger King chain, for top dollar.    &quot;If anyone can wring premium prices out of not-so-premium businesses, it's Don Kelly,&quot; said John McMillin, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.    Another possible target for Mr. Kelly is Kraft Inc., whose chairman, John M. Richman, is considered by some analysts to be one of the food industry's weakest chief executives. If Kraft's No. 2 executive, President Michael A. Miles, is recruited by Pillsbury, as some in the industry say is possible, Kraft would become even more vulnerable.    But Mr. Kelly probably can't make a move until at least midsummer, after the Tropicana sale, the completion of Beatrice's complicated annual audit and a possible spinoff of Beatrice's Swift-Eckrich Inc. meat business.    Beatrice's remaining businesses are Hunt tomato products, Wesson cooking oils and Beatrice cheeses.    The $1.2 billion Tropicana sale puts Mr. Kelly within striking distance of paying off the debt from the $6.2 billion leveraged buy-out of Beatrice he engineered in 1986 with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. Assuming Tropicana is sold, the debt will be reduced to roughly $800 million, about one-tenth of the size it was when the company went private.    Even before the remaining sales, Kohlberg Kravis and the other investors now count themselves roughly $102.7 million ahead on the Beatrice leaveraged buy-out. Sales of Beatrice assets have brought an estimated $7.3 billion. Beatrice's total debt immediately following the leveraged buyout was nearly $8 billion, and many analysts doubted that Mr. Kelly could peddle Beatrice's pieces at prices high enough to turn a profit.    But now a huge profit seems assured. Whether Beatrice's remaining units are sold or spun off, the gains on them could reach $2.5 billion on a pretax basis, analysts and investment bankers said. That would make the Beatrice buy-out the most profitable of its kind. </TEXT></DOC>
