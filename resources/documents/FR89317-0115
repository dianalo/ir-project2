Hundreds of thousands of the children of this nation are endangeringtheir lives and their futures. Crime, Violence, and tragedy sear the livesof victims, families, and friends.In response to this national problem, the Congress, in October 1986, passedand the President signed into law, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (Pub.L. 99-570) as part of the new Federal initiative to prevent alcohol anddrug abuse. Section 4005 of that law amended Part A of Title 5 of the PublicHealth Service Act by adding a section establishing the Office for SubstanceAbuse Prevention (OSAP) in the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration(ADAMHA) and authorizing the Director of OSAP to support a demonstrationgrant program that ``shall make grants to public and nonprofit privateentities for projects to demonstrate effective models for the prevention,treatment, and rehabilitation of drug abuse and alcohol abuse among highrisk youth'' (sec. 509A.(a)).In October 1988, Congress further amended this law by broadening the categoriesof high risk youth, directing OSAP to give priority to applications witha strong evaluation component, and by elevating OSAP to Institute levelstatus (Pub. L. 100-690). These statutory guidelines and the experienceOSAP has gained from the demonstration grant projects funded under theearlier grant announcement are the basis for the orientation of this announcement.The programs covered by this announcement are one part of a broad Federalinitiative to establish effective drug and alcohol abuse prevention, treatment,and rehabilitation programs. OSAP strongly encourages potential applicantsto proposed innovative methods for improving coordination and collaborationamong health, criminal justice, education, voluntary and other relevantcommunity-based organizations and service systems to provide comprehensive,multilevel substance abuse prevention messages. This announcement emphasizesthe importance of a comprehensive holistic approach to the prevention andtreatment of alcohol and other drug use by high risk youth. <ITAG tagnum="84">Program Goals</ITAG>The OSAP goals for this Grant Announcement are to support a small numberof demonstration programs that will develop and evaluate approaches atthe client and/or service systems levels targeted toward: (a) Decreasing the incidence and prevalence of drug and alcohol use amonghigh risk youth;(b) Reducing the risk factors for using alcohol and other drugs as theyimpact on individual high risk youth, and on the environments in whichhigh risk youths and their families function; (c) Increasing resiliency and protective factors within high risk youthand within high risk families and communities to reduce the likelihoodthat youths will use alcohol and other drugs; (d) Coordinating and integrating the non-use messages and activities ofthe many human service systems and other social influences affecting highrisk youth into comprehensive, multilevel prevention communities; (e) Increasing the availability and accessibility of prevention, treatmentand rehabilitation service of these populations; (f) Reducing the severity of impairment and promoting the rehabilitationof youths already using alcohol and other drugs.The specific aims and objectives of an applicant need not address all ofthese OSAP program goals. However, proposed projects should be consonantwith one or more of these goals. <ITAG tagnum="84">Program Emphasis </ITAG>OSAP will fund service and service systems demonstration projects thatpropose promising models or innovative approaches for prevention, treatment,and rehabilitation services for high risk youth. OSAP especially encouragesapplications to demonstrate effective models in primary prevention andin early intervention.Projects supported under this announcement may be client or systems oriented.That is, the focus of the project may be on reducing specific risk factorsfor alcohol and other drug use among youth in a targeted population oron developing a system of linked, coordinated, community-based servicesso as to address multiple risk factors for alcohol and other drug use amonghigh risk youth. However, projects that propose to address systems-levelchange must eventually relate these changes to client benefit. Applicants'approaches to service delivery or service system collaboration must bebased on state-of-the-art practices and relevant knowledge and theoriesin the prevention and treatment fields. Recent evidence suggests that substance abuse among youth is associatedwith multiple risk and resiliency factors that are inherent within theindividual (e.g. genetics, personality, physical health), the individual'senvironment (e.g. family, peers) and the individual's interaction withhis/her environment. Likelihood that a young person will use and abusealcohol and other drugs appears to increase as the number of risk factorsincrease and the number of resiliency or protective factors decrease. Riskand resiliency factors affecting high risk youth may include immediateand extended family, peers, school, neighborhood, community and the largersociety. Special stresses and protective factors may be associated withthe membership of many high risk youth in racial-ethnic minorities. Anypreventive or treatment intervention is likely to be more effective ifit focuses on reducing the power of risk factors and increasing the potencyof resiliency factors across several environmental levels. Prevention/interventionmodels proposing to target single risk factors are likely to be less effective.OSAP intends to fund applications that target youths with multiple riskfactors, and propose comprehensive, multilevel prevention/interventionstrategies that address clearly specified risk factors. When these riskfactors involve several human service systems (e.g., juvenile justice system,educational system, social welfare system, mental health system, substanceabuse service system, etc.), a coordinated prevention/intervention modelis encouraged. Proposals to demonstrate effective comprehensive servicesystems, particularly model service systems directed at primary preventionand early intervention, are a priority focus of this announcement.The following guidelines reflecting the emphases of this announcement areoffered to optimize the potential for successful projects.A. Project ModelThis announcement will fund projects that hold promise for demonstratingeffective models for the prevention, early intervention, treatment andrehabilitation of alcohol and other drug use by high risk youth as definedbelow. OSAP especially encourages applications to demonstrate effectivemodels in primary prevention and in early intervention.1. Primary prevention focuses on high risk youth who are not users of alcoholor other drugs;2. Early intervention focuses on youth who have an early involvement orare experimenting with alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or other illicit substances(such as inhalants, solvents, or prescription medications);3. Treatment/rehabilitation focuses on youth who are users of alcohol orother drugs and in need of treatment and/or rehabilitation.B. Target Populations<ITAG tagnum="81">High Risk Youth</ITAG>This legislation, as modified by the Anti-Drug Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-690),defines ``high risk youth'' as ``any individual who has not attained theage of 21 years, who is at high risk of becoming or who has become a drugabuser or an alcohol abuser and who:(1) Is identified as a child of a substance abuser;(2) Is a victim of physical, sexual, or psychological abuse;(3) Has dropped out of school;(4) Has become pregnant;(5) Is economically disadvantaged;(6) Has committed a violent or delinquent act;(7) Has experienced mental health problems;(8) Has attempted suicide;(9) Has experienced long-term physical pain due to injury; or(10) Has experienced chronic failure in school.'' (sec. 509A(f); Pub. L.100-690)These are illustrative categories of youth that have a high probabilityof being at risk for the use of alcohol and other drugs. The list is notexhaustive and it is not meant to exclude other documented groups of highrisk youth.There are many factors that place a child at risk for using alcohol andother drugs. Some of these factors are a function of the individual; somea function of the physical, cultural, social, political, and economic environmentin which the individual resides. It is the multiplicity of these risk factorsthat increases the probabilities of alcohol and other drug use among youth.High risk youth are those who experience multiple risk factors.<ITAG tagnum="81">Age Groups</ITAG>Projects should be designed to address the risks associated with specificdevelopmental age groups. These age groupings roughly correspond to majorschool divisions (e.g., preschool [3-5 years]; elementary school [6-11years]; middle school [12-14 years]; high school [15-18 years]; and college[19-20 years]. If more than one developmental age group is included ina single application, separate evaluations must be planned for each groupso that it is possible to assess independently the efficacy of the interventionon this developmental group.C. Comprehensiveness of ProjectCurrent prevention theory recognizes that the use of alcohol and otherdrugs by youth is caused by multiple risk factors involving personality,environmental and behavioral variables. It is the intent of this programto encourage the planning and implementation of prevention and treatmentstrategies that address the individual holistically by considering a multiplicityof risk factors for alcohol and other drug use. Priority will be givento prevention as well as early intervention models that address specifiedrisk factors for the use of alcohol and other drugs at the individual levelas well as some risk factors associated with the environment in which suchyouth reside (e.g., family or significant others in the environment ofsuch youth, peers, school and/or recreation environment, community andsociety).D. Coordination with Other AgenciesThe use of alcohol and other drugs, juvenile delinquency, impaired andreckless driving, chronic school failure, dropping out of school, and sexualactivity at an early age are closely related problem behaviors frequentlyfound in the same young people. Depending upon which problem behavior ismanifested, a different human service system may be activated. Prioritywill be given to prevention as well as early intervention projects thatcoordinate with and/or establish service linkages with other human servicesystems that have an appropriate vital stake in the target population.E. Project OrientationProjects supported under this program may be client or system oriented.Applicants' programs may focus on reducing specific risk factors for alcoholand other drug use among specific youth served in a targeted population.Projects may also propose to develop a system of linked, coordinated, community-basedservices, public policy initiatives, and media campaigns to address multipleenvironmental and individual risk factors. Effective models are neededof both <T3>client- </T3>and <T3>system-</T3>level prevention and early intervention strategies. Applicantsproposing to address systems-level change must relate their program activitiesultimately to changes in the behaviors of high risk youths. Measuring effectivenessof system-level interventions, then, must include both service system andclient level outcome indicators. An applicant proposing a system-levelintervention may plan one or two years of system development before expectingto measure client level behavior changes in high risk youth. Applicantsmay also propose projects that include aspects of both client and systemapproaches.F. EvaluationThe Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-690) stipulates that fundingpriority should be given to prevention demonstration grant applicationsthat employ appropriate strategies for evaluating the effectiveness oftheir proposed projects. OSAP will support only projects with a well-developedevaluation plan. Evaluation plans will be expected to include process evaluationstrategies sufficient to facilitate replication of the project if the approachproves promising. Therefore, program evaluation plans should address howthe program was implemented, including what services were provided, towhom, when, how often, and in what settings.Proposals must also include plans to evaluate the effectiveness of theirinterventions. The evaluation plan should be logically derived from theservice or service system objectives of the project. A strong evaluationcomponent of prevention demonstration efforts is essential if programsare to add to our knowledge of effective prevention and treatment interventionswith high risk youth. Well intended prevention programs do not always havegood outcomes. Typically, outcome evaluations include collection of pre-and post-intervention measurements on pre-planned indicators of effectiveness.Outcome variables and instruments should logically relate to the plannedprogram activities and the theories and models which underlie the plannedprogram. Priority will be given to projects that have access to evaluation expertiseon staff or by means of contract or linkage with a university or otherappropriate organization with evaluation expertise. It is advisable thatevaluation expertise be involved in the design of the project and developmentof the application so as to ensure the integration of evaluation in theconceptualization of the project. Between 15 percent to 20 percent of thebudget should be allocated to evaluation activities. Applicants are furtherencouraged to explore the possibility of in-kind support and cost-sharingwith universities or public or private organizations to enhance the project'sevaluation component. This Request for Applications solicits applications for <T3>service demonstration</T3> projects that propose promising models orinnovative approaches to the issues outlined above. All projects will beexpected to have a well developed program evaluation plan which is derivedfrom the service activities of the project. Applicants should propose approacheswith a sound conceptual basis consistent with state of the art practices,knowledge and theories in the field of prevention. However, OSAP does not support prevention research or prevention researchdemonstrations. Accordingly, applications using rigorously controlled experimentaldesigns for the purpose of assessing the efficacy of particular interventionsmay be more appropriate for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA),the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), or theNational Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Individuals interested in preventionresearch or research demonstrations should contact NIDA, NIAAA, or NIMHwhich support prevention research. <ITAG tagnum="84">Project Requirements </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Allow for two persons (project director and one other person to bedesignated by the project director) to attend one national meeting in theWashington, DC area each year. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Include a commitment to cooperate fully in the development and conductof a national evaluation of the grant program including meeting the OSAPgrant reporting guidelines. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Provide a final report that can serve as an implementation manual,in accordance with OSAP guidelines. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">_Involve a range of interest groups, relevant organizations and agenciesin the planning and implementation of the project along with documentationof such involvement e.g., letters of support and/or commitment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Eligibility </ITAG>Any public or nonprofit entity is eligible to apply for this grant program.Current recipients of OSAP demonstration grants are eligible if they proposenew projects in response to this announcement.

Specific Aims </ITAG>This section should state concisely the objectives of the project, anddescribe briefly what the project intends to accomplish. Suggested lengthof section: One-half to one page. The applicant must clearly outline the objectives for the proposed projectand show how these objectives relate to OSAP goals listed in Section Aof this announcement. Applicants should address the following types ofquestions in this section of the application: What is the intervention expected to accomplish (e.g., improve grades;improve family parental skills; change family attitude toward drug use;increase unfavorable attitudes towards alcohol and other drug use in schoolenvironment; initiate community effort to find after-school employmentfor high risk youth)? Which risk factors are expected to be reduced by the intervention proposedby this project? Which resiliency factors will be enhanced? How many youth (and/or families) are expected to be reached and in whattime frame? What changes are anticipated in the relevant services delivery system tohigh risk youth as a result of the intervention proposed by this project?Why do you anticipate changes in these objectives? What model, theory,evidence from clinical practice, or other grounds suggest that these goalswill be met? <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Background and Significance </ITAG>This section should sketch the background that led to the proposed project,cite and evaluate pertinent literature, identify gaps/needs which the projectwill fill, and state how the project will relate to objectives or specificaims identified in the previous section. A brief and focused reivew ofthe literature as well as any relevant prior work, observations, or experiencesof the applicant must be included in this section. Competing renewal applicationsmust include a progress report as part of the pertinent background. Suggestedlength of section: three to five pages. For systems oriented applications, include a description of any currentor planned statewide and/or community-wide activities aimed at improvingcommunity based services for the target population(s), and a discussionof problem areas still needing to be addressed.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Target Population</ITAG>Identify the target population(s) the project is intended to serve. Includespecial characteristics of the target population, such as risk factors,incidence and prevalence data, location, demographic and socioeconomiccharacteristics, and ethnic/cultural minority composition. Suggested lengthof section: One to three pages.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Approach/Method</ITAG>This section describes how the project would actually be accomplished.Applications must clearly describe the approaches and methods to be used,including screening measures, recruitment procedures, and curricular orintervention strategies. The only page length guideline that can be givenis that this section forms the core of the proposal, and sufficient detailshould be provided to provide reviewers a clear understanding of the approachplanned.Applications should include the following information in this section:Procedures for gaining access to the target group. Applicants should indicateplans for dealing with the difficult and critical issues of identification,recruitment, involvement, retention, and follow-up with these populations;Where appropriate, plans for any special attention to be given to the uniqueneeds and concerns of members of cultural and ethnic minority groups withinthe target populations;A plan of action that describes the project, discusses how each activityrelated to the project will be approached, coordinated with existing programs(where appropriate), and implemented. Program components should be relatedto information from the background section of the proposal (e.g. needs,existing service, previous accomplishments).An impact model that provides reasoning for the linkages between specificprogram activities and immediate and longer term expected outcomes. Thisimpact model provides the logical rationales for expecting planned interventionsto have desired effects. Where appropriate to the planned program (e.g. in systems oriented interventions),provide plans for and evidence of coordination with existing local, State,and/or Federal programs. Specific working agreements (pending funding)should be included as appendices, where appropriate. Justification shouldbe provided if no such working agreements are included. Evidence of existingor previous joint efforts should be submitted, if available. At a minimum,letters of support from all cooperating organizations should be provided.Such letters should be specific with respect to the commitment (e.g., personneland other resources, access to populations) and the intent of the organizationsinvolved. Specific working agreements and letters of support should beattached as appendices.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Evaluation Plan</ITAG>OSAP will support only projects with well developed program evaluationplans. Such plans will be expected to include process evaluation strategiessufficient to facilitate replication of the project if the approach provespromising. Proposals must also include plans for outcome/impact evaluationsto determine whether the program was effective in meeting its goals. Therefore,program evaluation plans should address how the program will document programimplementation and outcome, including means for determining what serviceswere provided, to whom, when, how often, in what settings, and to whateffect. Applications determined to have an inadequate evaluation design,or that provide insufficient detail concerning evaluation plans will bejudged to be incomplete and removed from further review. Suggested sectionlength: Two to five pages.Applicants should demonstrate plans to secure appropriate evaluation expertiseeither on their staff or through arrangements with university or otherappropriate organization providing evaluation expertise. Letters of agreementshould be referenced in this section, and included as appendices.Process evaluation involves the design and collection of data that permitsa quantitative and qualitative description of the implementation of theproject (e.g., description of size and nature of client population, staffcharacteristics, amount and types of services provided). The results ofprocess evaluation should be a description that others who wish to replicatethe program could use to set up their own program. Process evaluationsmay include qualitative and quantitative data collection procedures. The purpose of the outcome evaluation is to demonstrate whether the implementedintervention(s) had the desired effect on the target population and wherepossible to show that these effects are specific to the implemented intervention(s)as opposed to other factors. The nature of the outcome data will vary asa function of the goals of the project. Applicants should describe theirevaluation designs, proposed instruments (with copies of measures includedin the appendices), a tentative schedule and procedure for the collectionof data, and a description of the data analysis plan.For client-focused projects, evaluation plans should include measures ofthe results/benefits anticipated from the proposed intervention on thetarget population. For systems-focused projects, evaluation plans shouldinclude indicators of system benefits as well as benefits for individualsin the target population.Depending on the complexity of the proposed program, and the degree towhich early program activities are devoted to implementation and stabilizationof programs, it may be unrealistic to expect evidence of effectivenessduring the first year of funding. However, it would be considered advisableto collect evaluation data on a trial or pilot basis during the first yearof the demonstration program in order to gather baseline information forcomparison purposes.<ITAG tagnum="81">F. Project Management Plan</ITAG>The Project Management Plan must include a description of the tasks tobe performed, a schedule of the tasks, and their relationship to each otherand to the program goals. The individual/staff positions responsible foreach task should be identified, as well as the manner that each positionand task will relate to the project director. Biographical sketches ofkey personnel should be included on the appropriate pages of form PHS 398or included in a readily identifiable appendix.The management plan should show how tasks are related to the project goalsand objectives, as well as to the management of the project. A PERT orGantt chart and/or flow diagrams may be helpful to display these tasks.1. <T3>Organizational structure. </T3>A narrative description of the organizationalstructure of the proposed demonstration project should indicate the organizationalrelationships and responsibilities of the Project Director and each projectunit or activity.The responsibilities and composition of governing or supervisory boardsshould be included, where applicable. Organizational relationships betweenthe applicant and other State/local level health and human services agenciesshould be briefly described, if these relate to the proposed project. Anorganizational chart should be provided which illustrates relationshipsand lines of responsibility.2. <T3>Organizational capability.</T3> Applicants should provide evidencethat the organization is capable of implementing the proposed project.Documentation of experience in similar or other relevant activities, accessto the target population(s), expertise in service delivery and evaluation,experience in developing and effectively using interorganizational agreements,and other indicators of capability should be provided as appropriate. Theuse of external expertise is encouraged when helpful (e.g., evaluationconsultants) and not available within the organization.3. <T3>Staffing.</T3> Briefly described the jobs/roles that will make up theproposed project. Job descriptions should be included in the appendicesfor each key professional position identified in the proposed budget. Jobdescriptions should include: Job title, description of duties and responsibilities,qualifications for the position, supervisory relationships, skills andknowledge required, prior experience required, educational background required,and job site (if appropriate). Include as appendices resumes for all keystaff and consultants proposed for the project. These resumes should includenames, present citizenship, educational background, major professionalinterest(s), membership in professional organizations, professional experience,honors received, and recent relevant publications. Experience and/or trainingpertinent to the proposed project should be highlighted.This portion of the management plan should include a brief descriptionof staff recruitment and selection procedures, and any planned mix of background,skills, and/or personal qualities needed for the project.Consideration must be given to the use of multidisciplinary staff and staffrepresenting the race, gender, ethnic, and cultural characteristics ofthe population to be served by the project.<ITAG tagnum="81">G.
