 The use of the term property accuratelyreflects that these rights are property rights that can be assigned,licensed, or even used as collateral.andP;  The term intellectual denotes the lackof a physical quality to the rights.andP;  For example, the copyright in acomputer program is separate from the physical copy of the program.andP;  Thisnon-physical quality of intellectual property rights is also a chief causefor most people's confusion regarding those rights.andM;For the most part, intellectual property laws have a broad perspective andare not directed specifically to software.andP;  There are some exceptions,however, like the federal copyright statute which specifically mentionscomputer programs and includes a section directed to the law of copyrights asapplied to computer software.andP;  Most intellectual property laws do not havesuch provisions, however, and as future columns will point out, problems doarise when general intellectual property concepts are stretched to fitcomputer software.andM;The different forms of intellectual property differ in the type of protectionthey afford, the subject matter which can be protected, the manner ofobtaining protection, and the form of government (state or federal) whichenforces the specific laws giving rise to the protection.andP;  For example, anintellectual property right may arise from a federal law, and thereby beapplied equally throughout the country, or may result from a state law, andthus vary from state to state.andP;  Intellectual property protection may alsoresult of a number of court decisions.andP;  Generally, this is referred to as thecommon law.andM;COPYRIGHTSandM;One of the most popular forms of intellectual property protection forcomputer software is the copyright law.andP;  The current copyright law came intoeffect in 1978.andP;  In 1980, certain changes were made to define copyrightprotection for computer programs.andP;  The copyright law is a federal law andcompletely preempts any state copyright laws which may have existed prior to1976.andM;Copyright protects &quot;original works of authorship&quot; against unauthorizedcopying.andP;  Perhaps the most basic statement about copyrights is that thecopyright laws protect expression but not ideas.andP;  Although this sounds like asimple statement, substantial litigation, including many cases in thecomputer software area, involve the question of what is an idea and what isan expression.andP;  For example, there has been recent press coverage concerning&quot;look and feel&quot; protection for computer programs under the copyright laws.andO;The underlying issues in these &quot;look and feel&quot; cases is whether theprotectable expression in a computer program extends beyond the literalprogram listing to the &quot;structure, sequence, and organization&quot; of the programand, if so, where is the line drawn between what is considered expression andwhat is considered idea.andM;Fortunately, issues of copyright duration are not as controversial.andO;Copyright protection comes into being (subsists&quot;) when an original work ofauthorship is created.andP;  Thus, the mere act of authoring creates the copyrightfor that work.andM;Copyright registration is not needed to obtain protection.andP;  A copyrightregistration must be obtained before one can sue for copyright infringement,however, and certain monetary recoveries may not be available in infringementprecedes registration.andP;  The U.S.andP;  Copyright Office issues copyrightregistrations.andM;For works created after January 1, 1978, copyright protection exists eitherfor the life of the author plus 50 years after his or her death, or for 75years from publication for anonymous works or works made for hire (e.g.,andO;works created by an employee in the course of employment).andM;Maintaining copyright protection is easy.andP;  Until March 1, 1989, all one needsto do is place a copyright notice on any publicly distributed copies of thework.andP;  Copyright notice includes the word &quot;copyright,&quot; &quot;Copr.,&quot; or acopyright symbol, plus the date that the work was created and anidentification of the owner of the copyright.andP;  Copyright notice is not neededfor copies that are not publicly distributed, but it is generally a good ideato include notice.andP;  After March 1, notice will no longer be required but isadvised.andM;PATENTSandM;Patents, like copyrights, arise under federal law and have their origin inthe U.S.andP;  Constitution.andP;  Otherwise, patents and copyrights are guitedifferent.andP;  They are obtained in different ways, provide different types ofprotection, and have different lifetimes.andM;Patents may protect inventions for processes, machines, manufacturers, orcompositions of matter.andP;  Most computer software-related inventions are eitherprocesses, such as computer-driven processes, or machines, such as certainprogrammed computers.andP;  After a long battle, the Supreme Court has finallysettled the issue of the patentability of software-related inventions and hasheld that those inventions are judged for patentability in the same way asnon-software related inventions.andM;In the United States, applications for patent protection are subject tostrict examination requirements.andP;  The U.S.andP;  Patent and Trademark Office hasresponsibility for examining applications for patents.andM;Once obtained, however, patent protection is easy to maintain, requiring onlythe payment of certain maintenance fees.andP;  Patent protection can last for upto 17 years after the grant of the patent if all the maintenance fees arepaid.andP;  After that time, the subject matter of the patented invention is inthe public domain.andM;Patents provide relatively strong protection because, unlike copyrights ortrade secrets, patents may be infringed even if there is no copying.andP;  Thus, apatent can be enforced against others who independently develop their owncomputer programs if those programs are used in a way that infringes thepatent.andP;  The scope of patent protection is also generally greater than thatof copyright protection.andP;  This is because patent protection is not limited toone machine or process, but instead covers a class of machines or processesdefined by the scope of the claims of the patent.andM;A patent grants its owner the exclusive right to make, use and sell theinvention throughout the United States.andP;  Under a new law, certain types ofmanufacturing outside of the United States may also be an infringement.andP;  Itis also an infringement to contribute to or actively induce infringement byothers.andM;Manufacture, use or sale of an invention in the United States without thepatent owner's authorization constitutes patent infringement and may beenjoined.andP;  In addition, the infringer may be subject to actual damages and,under certain circumstances, a form of punitive damages.andM;TRADE SECRETSandM;Unlike patent and copyright protection, trade secret protection arises fromthe common law or state statutes.andP;  The subject matter available for tradesecret protection is virtually limitless.andP;  Theoretically, trade secretprotection also has an indefinite lifetime because the duration of tradesecret protection depends upon the trade secret owner's continued maintenanceof secrecy and on the absence of another party's legal discovery of the tradesecret.andP;  The continued vigilance necessary to obtain secrecy often makes thisform of protection expensive and time-consuming to maintain.andP;  If the tradesecret owner is not vigilant and allows the protected information to passinto public domain, all protection is lost.andM;Unlike patents, trade secret protection is relatively easy to obtain becausethere is no examination or registration necessary.andP;  Generally information canqualify for trade secret protection if it is not commonly known and if it ismaintained relatively secret.andP;  Trade secret protection is also availableimmediately and is therefore attractive for computer software.andM;Trade secrets can arise by contract, such as an employment contract or adevelopment contract, or from certain relationships, such as anemployer/employee relationship.andP;  Once a contract or a relationshipestablishing trade secrets exists, a trade secret owner may restrict the useand disclosure of the trade secret information by other parties to thecontract or the relationship.andM;Trade secret protection is generally not as far-reaching as patentprotection.andP;  Similar to copyrights, trade secret rights are limited toprevention of copying and cannot be used to prevent another's independentdevelopment of the protected information.andP;  Thus, reverse-engineering alawfully obtained product to discover the trade secrets is permissible in theabsence of some other provision of a contract preventing such activities.andM;TRADEMARKSandM;Trademark protection is completely different from the other forms describedabove because trademarks protect names of the products or processes and notthe products or processes themselves.andP;  In addition, trademarks and servicemarks are protected not only by a federal statute, known as the Lanham Act,but also by state statutes and the common law.andM;The Lanham Act defines a trademark as &quot;any word, name, symbol, device or anycombination thereof adopted and used by a manufacturer or merchant toidentify his goods ...andP;  and distinguish them from those manufactured or soldby others.&quot;andP;  Often, the term trademark is used to refer to marks whichidentify services, but such marks are properly called service marks.andP;  Inaddition, trademark has been used to refer to a trade name or a commercialname.andP;  A trade name or commercial name refers to names or symbols used todistinguish companies or businesses.andP;  Trade names are technically nottrademarks.andP;  Although trademarks and service marks may be protected under theLanham Act, trade names and commercial names are protectable only by stateand common law.andM;To qualify for federal protection, a trademark or service mark must be usedin interstate commerce, although recent amendments to the Lanham Act permitregistration if there is an intent to use the mark in interstate commerce.andO;If the trademark or service mark is so used, a registration can be filed inthe U.S.andP;  Patent and Trademark Office.andP;  Examiners in that office then granttrademark registrations if the trademarks or service marks meet the statutoryrequirements.andP;  Federal trademark rights are maintained by continued use ofthe trademarks and by filing an affidavit of continuing use with the Patentand Trademark Office.andP;  The state requirements for obtaining and maintainingtrademark protection usually differ from state to state.andM;Trademarks give their owners the right to prohibit unauthorized use of theirtrademarks to protect the goodwill associated with the marks.andP;  A trademarkowner thus has the right to prevent the use of his mark by others when suchuse is likely to cause confusion or mistake or is likely to deceive.andP;  Thescope of protection for a trademark depends not only the similarity betweenthe protected mark and the potentially infringing mark, but also on thechannels of commerce in which those marks are used.andM;Trademarks for computer software products often represent the most valuableproprietary right for those products.andP;  This is especially so for companiesthat first introduce particular products, since those products' trademarksmay result in valuable marketing advantages.andM;CONCLUSIONandM;For the most part, the different forms of intellectual property protectionare compatible with each other.andP;  For example, a new product which involvescomputer software may be protected by the patent laws while at the same timethe copyright laws protect the software, trade secret laws protect certainelements of the product and trademark laws protect the name of the product.andM;The only two types of protections which are directly incompatible are patentsand trade secrets.andP;  This is because the issuance of a patent makes public theinformation in the patent document, thereby destroying any trade secretprotection.andP;  In addition, the patent laws require disclosure of the &quot;bestmode&quot; of carrying out the invention and a company's trade secrets ofteninclude that best mode.andP;  Under certain circumstances, however, trade secretscan be used to protect different aspects of an invention for which patentprotection is not sought.andM;The application of copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws tocomputer software will be detailed in future columns.andP;  What will becomeapparent from these discussions is that computer software is very differentfrom most of the other products or processes for which protection is sought,and many fundamental rules of intellectual property protection do not applywell to computer software.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
