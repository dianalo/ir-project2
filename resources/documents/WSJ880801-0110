We would be history, no one would be employed here and no products would be coming off the line,&quot; Ryal R. Poppa, chairman of Colorado-based Storage Technology Corp., recently wrote Senator William L. Armstrong. &quot;This is one of the most anti-competitive, anti-employee and anti-business pieces of legislation to come along in a long time and for what reason? A quick fix for the presidential race.&quot;    Succinctly put. The plant-closings bill both Houses have passed is not social legislation but political gamesmanship. Democrats pushed it through for one central purpose, to force President Reagan to oppose a bill that, on the surface, looks like a vote for motherhood and cherry pie. Many Republican candidates are begging the President not to veto and thus damage their chances for election. But he should veto, because it is a bad bill and his party and the country need a demonstration of political leadership.    At first glance, the plant-closings bill seems eminently reasonable. Why shouldn't workers be notified 60 days in advance that they may be facing a layoff? The answer is that the warning itself greatly increases the chances that worse layoffs will occur. Employers often are hit by unexpected adversities that require quick cost cuts, including layoffs. A 60-day notice prolongs losses. Equally troublesome, it alarms creditors and banks, which typically descend on the company with claims on working capital that already is in short supply.    Mr. Poppa in late 1984 had to take his company down from 14,000 employees world-wide to 9,000 in the space of a few months to, as he put it, &quot;stem cash losses and survive.&quot; It was painful, but he did it, and the company is healthy again.    &quot;Management must have the flexibility to make business judgments without broad legislative restrictions to remain competitive in our global economy,&quot; said Mr. Poppa. Indeed it must. The remarkable thing is that the closings bill comes along just at a time when corporations all over the U.S. have been demonstrating an adaptive capacity that is little short of amazing.    A good example is the steel industry. Given up for dead as recently as two years ago (after having absorbed $12 billion in total losses over the preceding five years) the steel industry posted profits of more than $750 million in 1987. While all the makers did not make money, most did. This year, the outlook is even brighter. Mills are currently operating at 90% of capacity, compared with 74% a year ago. Exports are up 30% from a year earlier. Industry profits already exceed all of last year.    This didn't happen without painful restructuring, some of which had been long postponed. Bethlehem closed its 83-year-old Lackawanna, N.Y., plant. USX shut down the McKeesport and Homestead works. LTV Corp. closed most of its Aliquippa, Pa., steel mill. And so it has gone throughout the industry, with old, inefficient capacity being closed and a new, streamlined industry, with a smaller work force, emerging. The dislocation for individual workers has been enormous.    Yet at the end of the day, the U.S. not only once again has a viable steel industry, but also has 17.2 million more jobs than it had in November 1982. Because of adaptations throughout U.S. industry, the total U.S. economy is far more efficient and competitive than it was 10 years ago. Efficiency doesn't destroy jobs, it generates the wealth to create new, and usually better, jobs. An article in the latest Fortune describes &quot;The Resurrection of the Rust Belt,&quot; showing how not only companies but workers themselves have met the competitiveness challenge. Human resiliency is the expression that best applies.    Some supporters of the closings bill unwittingly defeated their own arguments by citing European layoff laws as precedent; because of such laws, Europe has been far slower than the U.S. to meet modern competitive challenges. Its employment growth has been practically nil.    Change is inevitable, in markets, in institutions and in human lives. When Congress legislates against adaptation, as it has so often while professing to &quot;protect&quot; some interest group, it is voting for stagnation. President Reagan should veto the closings bill on grounds that he favors economic growth, not stagnation. We doubt that his argument will play as badly with the voters as both his political friends and enemies seem to think. </TEXT></DOC>
