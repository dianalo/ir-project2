With conservative columnist Pat Buchanan piecing togetherthe elements of a presidential campaign, President Bush facesa challenge to his leadership of the Republican Party. TheWhite House plays down the threat, but Mr. Buchanan couldbecome a magnet for discontented voters.</LP><TEXT>   The focus of activity for Mr. Buchanan would be NewHampshire, which gave George Bush his boost in the 1988presidential primaries but which is now suffering severeeconomic distress. Two Republican operatives are puttingtogether the structure of a campaign that would have thesupport of the Manchester Union Leader, the devoutlyconservative statewide newspaper.   Mr. Buchanan, 53 years old, isn't expected to announcewhether he will run until the end of the month. He wasn'tavailable for comment yesterday. The early campaignorganizing is being overseen by his sister, Angela BayBuchanan, a wellknown California conservative activist.   Some of President Bush's political associates warn that aBuchanan candidacy, while extremely unlikely to topple thepresident, could cause him political problems andembarrassment.   &quot;This conservative group could put together a goodorganization and Buchanan could do quite well,&quot; says formerGOP Gov. Hugh Gregg, who has been involved in Bush campaignsin the past. &quot;There are a lot of people around here who willvote for Bush when it's important, but who would like to sendhim a message.&quot;   Republican political analysts in New Hampshire agree thatMr. Buchanan, a social conservative who is often described asan isolationist, could win as much as 25% of the vote in thestate, which on Feb. 18 holds the first presidential primary.   Although Mr. Buchanan visited the state early in the year,most Republicans who spoke with him came away believing hewas intent on running in 1996, not next year. The notion of a1992 challenge to President Bush first surfaced last week inthe Union Leader, when publisher Nackey Loeb wrote in afront-page editorial that Mr. Bush had &quot;compromised away muchof {his} platform,&quot; praised Mr. Buchanan as &quot;the mostarticulate voice of conservatism today&quot; and urged him, &quot;Run,Pat, run]&quot;   Since then, Chris Tremblay, a former congressionalcandidate, and Paul Nagy, a party county chairman, have beenputting together an organization and are looking for officespace in Manchester.   A former aide to Presidents Nixon and Reagan, Mr. Buchananis attracting the support of some leading conservatives inthe state, including Jeffrey Hart, a Dartmouth Collegeprofessor and conservative syndicated columnist who plans toendorse the notion of a Buchanan campaign this weekend. Butin an interview yesterday, Mr. Hart acknowledged, &quot;Pat willbe a strong protest candidate, but I don't realisticallythink he can become president.&quot;   That view was widely shared in New Hampshire. &quot;It'sdifficult to see where he's going to go with it,&quot; said ThomasRath, a former New Hampshire attorney general. &quot;He has zerochance -- absolutely zero -- to be nominated. Maybe this is achance to push Bush to the right.&quot;   Not all conservatives are embracing the notion of aBuchanan candidacy, however. &quot;I don't think it's a goodidea,&quot; said former U.S. Sen. Gordon Humphrey, who now servesin the state senate. &quot;The economy here is in a big big messand the president has political problems enough withoutthis.&quot;   Eddie Mahe, a Republican political consultant inWashington, said the symbolism of a Buchanan candidacy may gobeyond the GOP. &quot;A vote for Buchanan will be the way peoplewill send a message, not only to the president but to thegovernment,&quot; he said. &quot;People are frustrated that politiciansjust aren't doing their job.&quot;   The prospect of a challenge to President Bush highlightsthe difficulties Mr. Bush faces in keeping together the GOPcoalition.   &quot;Both {Louisiana gubernatorial candidate} David Duke andPat Buchanan represent a Bush weakness: Regardless of how hedresses it up, he remains a country-club Republican,&quot; saidHarrison Hickman, a consultant to Democratic presidentialcandidate Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. &quot;The problem with anexpanded GOP is that you end up with class divisions. Thepeople Buchanan caddied for and resented were people likeGeorge Bush.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
