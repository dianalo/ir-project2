Approximately 200,000 people die each year eitherdirectly or indirectly from PE. If PE is not treated, the mortality rateis estimated to be 30%, whereas this rate is 8% in patients that aretreated with anticoagulant. If a patient is falsely diagnosed of havingPE, he is needlessly subjected to the risk of anticoagulation. The complicationrate of anticoagulation therapy is estimated to be {similar_to} 15%,and heparin is considered to be a major cause of drug related deathsin hospitalized patients. Thus, it is important that the diagnosis ofPE be made accurately. The clinical history, physical exam, and laboratoryevaluation have limited ability to accurately diagnose or exclude PE.Therefore, medical imaging is the major means by which this diagnosismust be made or excluded. This article will examine the various methodsby which PE may be diagnosed and will discuss the proper methods of theirinterpretation.</TEXT></DOC>
