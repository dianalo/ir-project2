Dukakis would ``unify this country and get on with the future,''said the woman with the white hair and the salty Southern accent.But George Bush, she said in scorning the Republican opposition,``Poor George ... he can't help it, he was born with a silver footin his mouth,'' she said scornfully of the Republican nominee-to-be.   Dukakis watched the show on television in his hotel suite a fewblocks away from the Omni hall where the delegates gathered to dohis bidding. His night comes Wednesday, when the nomination issealed, and again Thursday, when he accepts the party's prize.   The delegates convened a few hours after Dukakis and Jackson metprivately for more than two hours and emerged to say they hadsmoothed over the disagreements that marred the pre-conventionweek. Jackson is expected to campaign for the ticket this fall, andhis supporters will receive greater standing in the party as partof the accords.   ``We did not come here for fireworks. We came here for nobleworks,'' Jackson said. Party officials said that as a result of theunity pact with Dukakis, his supporters would receive close to halfthe 25 at-large slts on the Democratic National Committee as wellas the resources to campaign on behalf of the ticket this fall.   Unity was the official theme of the week. But network prime timewasn't five minutes old before the lingering tensions of theprimary campaign surfaced. ``Jesse, Jesse,'' Jackson's delegatesshouted rhythmically as America began watching. ``Dukakis,Dukakis,'' the governor's majority delegates shouted back acrossthe hall.   Some Jackson delegates said even though Dukakis and Jackson weretrying to make peace, they were ready to wage war off theconvention floor, and their repeated chants were intended to be amessage.   ``We are trying to show we still support Jesse Jackson and alsoshow the Democratic Party it should include us more in the powerstructure,'' said delegate Bernard Parker of Detroit.   Ms. Richards took the stage after humorist Garrison Keilloropened the televised program by leading a group of elementaryschool students in a warbling rendition of the national anthem.``In the key of G, the people's key,'' he said with practiced wrywit.   Her first ovation, and it was a big one, came after Richardsticked off a litany of Reagan administration figures who proved tobe unpopular with the Democrats.   ``I want to announce to this nation that in a little more than100 days, the Reagan Meese Deaver Nofziger Poindexter NorthWeinberger Watt Gorsuch Lavelle Stockman Haig Bork Noriega GeorgeBush-era will be over,'' she said to sustained applause.   She said, ``For eight straight years George Bush hasn'tdisplayed the slightest interest in anything we care about and nowthat he's after a job he can't get appointed to, he's like Columbusdiscovering America _ he's found child care, he's found education.''   Dukakis telephoned Ms. Richards at the podium after her speechto offer congratulations. ``What am I going to say on Thursday? Yousaid it all,'' spokesman Dayton Duncan quoted him as telling theTexan.   Party sources reported a gentleman's agreement on platformdisputes. Jackson agreed to withdraw 10 of 13 minority planks, andDukakis will ask his delegates to vote down his rival's call forhigher taxes on the wealthy and no first use of nuclear weapons.Jackson's call for a Palestinian homeland will be debated, and isexpected to be withdrawn without a vote, the sources said.   The convention opened as a new poll pointed to a close contestagainst the Republicans. An ABC survey found Bush drawing 46percent support to 45 percent for Dukakis nationwide. The networksaid the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus five points.   Only a fraction of the delegates were in their chairs when theopening gavel fell, but the floor began to approach gridlock as theparade of speakers went by. ``We're going to look good ontelevision,'' House Speaker Jim Wright, the convention chairman,said as delegates danced to a video presentation by entertainerNeil Diamond _ and that was precisely what the party's image-makershad in mind.   The convention cornerstone was laid at the end of the evening byformer President Carter, who urged the delegates to capture theparty's most elusive value: ``Unity, one more time, unity,'' heexhorted.   Jackson, beaten but unbowed after a gallant primary campaign,set a conciliatory tone in remarks to his delegates and said he waslooking forward to helping the nominee ``win in November.''   ``God gave this gentleman a gift and we're going to use it,''said Joseph Warren, an aide to Dukakis.   Jackson said he would have his name entered into nomination forpresident on Wednesday night, but added he had no plans to contestDukakis' selection of Bentsen for vice president, and would give``no encouragement'' to others who might.   The accords of Atlanta provided an upbeat curtain-raiser forDukakis' convention.   Party chairman Paul Kirk praised all those who lost out toDukakis _ or almost all. There was no mention of Gary Hart, thelong ago front-runner who twice entered the race and twicedeparted. Hart was in the convention city in the role of newspapercolumnist and television commentator.   Opening night showcased some Democrats little known on networktelevision and some who were instantly recognizable.   ``My name is Jimmy Carter, and I am not running for president.Did you hear that George?'' said the former president in a retortthat served at once as a revised version of his 1976 campaignslogan and a jab at Republican George Bush, who likes to callDukakis a Jimmy Carter Democrat _ and doesn't mean it as acompliment.   Carter no doubt liked the convention's initial results _acceptance of delegate credentials without a challenge for thefirst time in a quarter-century.   In her keynote address, Ms. Richards sounded the call for changethat lies at the heart of Dukakis' drive to reclaim the White Housefor the Democrats.   In a speech scripted for precisely 33 minutes, Ms. Richardspraised Dukakis, Bentsen and _ lavishly _ Jackson, and heaped scornon President Reagan and Vice President Bush.   ``Jesse Jackson is a leader and a teacher who can open ourhearts and our minds and stir our very souls,'' she said. ``Incontrast,'' she said, Reagan for eight straight years ``haspretended to us that he cannot hear our questions over thehelicopter noise.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
