King Hassan II of Morocco, however, granted a dispensation fromthe traditional fast to those Moslems involved in the fight againstthe swarms of locusts invading North Africa.   Ramadan, the ninth month of the Moslem lunar calendar, beganMonday in some parts of the world and on Sunday in other areas. Thetraditional beginning depends on a sighting of the new moon.   During Ramadan, observant Moslems are required to abstain fromfood, drink and tobacco during daylight hours. At sunset they eattheir ``fotour,'' an exotic meal with special drinks and manycourses.   On Sunday in Algiers, Algeria, the hijackers holding a KuwaitAirways jetliner with about 35 people aboard asked for a specialmeal for themselves and their captives before the beginning ofRamadan. The Algerians delivered ``souhour,'' the traditional mealof fermented cheese and dates.   After sunset Monday, the plane radioed its first request of theday for food. Forty packets were then hoisted up the side of theBoeing 747 with knotted tablecloths.   The hijackers had asked several times by radio beginningSaturday when Ramadan would commence this year.   In Kuwait, the emir and the crown prince canceled traditionalreceptions marking Islam's holiest month out of respect for theKuwaiti hostages aboard the jet, newspapers reported.   In Iran, the Interior Ministry issued a command for persons whoare exempt from fasting _ non-Moslems, soldiers in battle, sick andvery young people, travelers and pregnant women _ not to eat inpublic. Restaurants are banned from serving food and drink duringthe fasting hours from sunrise to sunset.   During the 7-year-old war with Iran, Iraq has offered temporarytruces during the holy month, citing Moslem injunctions that it isparticularly sinful for Moslems to kill Moslems during Ramadan.Iran has refused each year.   This year, the Iraqis used Ramadan to motivate their troops,dubbing their offensive in the Faw Peninsula the ``Blessed RamadanOperation.''   In his announcement for those fighting the war against theswarms of locusts, King Hassan stressed that civil defense workersand airplane crews ``are acting in the same way as the soldiersstationed on our borders who are watching over the security andinterests of the nation.''   Several years ago, the king also exempted soliders fightingagainst Polisario guerrillas in the former Spanish Sahara from thedaytime fasting obligations.</TEXT></DOC>
