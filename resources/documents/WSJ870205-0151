Now, James R. Ferguson, a federal prosecutor in Chicago, puts the camel's head in the tent by suggesting (editorial page, Jan. 23) that public officials give up their Fifth-Amendment right against self-incrimination.    Until his last few paragraphs, Mr. Ferguson refers to the Fifth Amendment as a privilege. No, Mr. Ferguson, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are not privileges. They are hard-won and hard-maintained rights for all of our people. The original amendments are not called the Bill of Privileges.    In 1980 some government employees (CIA) had to give up First-Amendment rights. Now it is suggested that officials give up Fifth-Amendment rights. In 1990, someone is going to suggest that government officials give up their Fourth-Amendment rights protecting them from unlawful searches. Why not? They may be hiding important documents in their homes.    The Constitution governs and protects all citizens from the president down to the homeless and no one is exempt from that protection -- no matter how difficult it makes the pursuit of justice. Only with that protection can we ensure true justice for all of us.    Harvey Gittler   Oberlin, Ohio</TEXT></DOC>
