Their solution isto raise taxes on the &quot;rich,&quot; though that strategy alwaysends up picking just about everyone's pockets.   Citizens for Tax Justice, a union-funded group, got someattention recently for a report claiming that in most states&quot;poor and middle-income families are taxed at rates well inexcess of the rate at which the very rich are taxed.&quot; Stateswithout an income tax were tagged the &quot;terrible 10&quot; forimposing lower taxes on the wealthiest 1% of income-earners.Ten states with high income taxes were celebrated as &quot;taxfairness&quot; states.</LP><TEXT>   The group's data are being disputed, but we were moststruck by a Cato Institute finding that many taxpayers arevoting with their feet; moreover, the &quot;terrible 10&quot; areattracting many new citizens to live amid their supposedterribleness. The reason, of course, is that such states notonly don't penalize success, but also tend to create more jobopportunities.   The nearby table shows that during the 1980s, the 10states with little or no income tax saw population growththat on average was 9 percentage points above the nationalaverage. Nevada, the state with the lowest taxes on thewealthy, grew by 41%. The so-called &quot;tax fairness&quot; statesgrew 2.4 percentage points below the national average, withsunny California the lone boom state.   At least three of the &quot;terrible 10&quot; states -- Connecticut,Tennessee and Texas -- are debating whether to impose anincome tax to balance their books, which are buckling underthe outsized public commitments the politicians made over thepast two decades. The 1980s show convincingly that bailingout the politicians with more new taxes is a recipe forreducing economic development and population growth. RichardVedder of Ohio University estimates that every day during the'80s an average of 1,000 people packed their bags and movedfrom the 10 highest-tax states to the 10 lowest-tax states.   It appears that Americans -- the rich, the middle classand surely much of the upwardly mobile poor -- have adifferent definition of tax fairness than the one cooked upby Citizens for Tax Justice. They prefer lower taxes, period,a policy that puts economic decisions in their hands, ratherthan in the hands of the imprudent characters running theirstate legislatures.   ---                     Tax Mobilization                                                                                                                                               GROWTH IN                                        POPULATION                        TAX RATE        (Relative                       ON TOP 1%        To National                         1991            Average)                                                                                                                           TEN HIGHEST RATES                                                                                                          New York               11.3             -  8%   California             10.6               16   Maine                  10.2                0   Oregon                  9.9             -  1   Hawaii                  9.8                5   New Jersey              9.7             -  5   Washington D.C.         9.7             - 18   Minnesota               9.6             -  1   Ohio                    9.6             -  8   Rhode Island            9.6             -  4   AVERAGE                 --              -2.4%                     TEN LOWEST RATES                                                                                                          Nevada                  1.8               41%   Wyoming                 2.4             - 12   Alaska                  2.5               28   Florida                 2.7               23   Texas                   3.1                4   Washington              3.4                9   South Dakota            3.5             -  6   Tennessee               3.6             -  3   New Hampshire           3.8               12   Alabama                 5.1             -  6   AVERAGE                 --               9.0%                                                                                                          Source: The Cato Institute</TEXT></DOC>
