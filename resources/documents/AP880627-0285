IBM confirmed Monday it has approached some companies abouttheir use of IBM patents in products that use Risc, short forreduced instruction set computer.   Risc is considered critical to the future of the computerindustry because it dramatically speeds up computing by simplifyingthe instructions that microprocessors have to perform.   Spokesmen for several companies that have used Risc technologyin the design of new microprocessors said their lawyers had notbeen contacted by IBM and they did not know what the computer giantwanted.   IBM's policy on Risc was first reported in Saturday's editionsof the New York Times. It was consistent with IBM's statementearlier this year that it intended to be more rigorous in itsenforcement of its patents.   IBM said Monday its more than 9,000 U.S. patents go well beyondRisc to include technology that is fundamental to the computerindustry.   In a far-reaching statement, it said, ``We believe that anyonewho is developing an information-handling system would probablyneed to use an IBM patent.''   IBM is not trying to shut down competitors using Risc. Thecompany has said it is willing to license all of its patents toother companies for reasonable terms and conditions.   Sun Microsystems Inc., the fast-growing Silicon Valleyworkstation maker, would seem to be a prime target for IBMenforcement because it has a popular new chip called Sparc that isbased on Risc technology. Sun's design has been adopted by suchcompanies as Unisys Corp., Xerox Corp. and American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co.   But Sun spokeswoman Carol Broadbent said Monday, ``We have notbeen approached ... We'll just have to wait and see, if IBM doesapproach and what kind of move they make.''   At Motorola Inc., whose new 88000 family of microprocessors isRisc-based, spokesman Charles Sengstock said, ``All we know isessentially what we've read.''   At Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which uses Risc technology inits new 29000 chip family, spokesman John Greenagel said, ``We havenot been contacted by them, so we're kind of in the dark as to whatmight be going on.''   Greenagel said he was pleased by reports that IBM _ its biggestcustomer _ does not intend to try to shut down other companiesusing Risc.   ``If IBM thinks there is a problem with us, we'll give it verycareful attention. But at this point we're not aware what thisproblem may be,'' Greenagel said.   IBM announced earlier this year that in new licensingagreements, it was asking licensees to pay it from 1 percent to 5percent of the revenue from products that use IBM patents,depending on the number of patents used and the extent of their use.   Many companies already have cross-licensing agreements with IBMthat would protect them from having to pay for use of patents, Riscor otherwise.</TEXT></DOC>
