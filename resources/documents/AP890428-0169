(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said Fridayhe hopes the idle Savannah River nuclear weapons plant will becomethe ``flagship'' of the nation's nuclear facilities, even though hehas delayed reopening it.   The Savannah River Site's three nuclear reactors, the nation'ssole source of tritium used in the production of nuclear warheads,have been shut down for safety modifications since August.   Watkins, in South Carolina to tour the plant, said he hoped toannounce a startup date for the reactors by July. Earlier thisweek, he said he would delay resumption of production at the plant,slated for late 1989, until at least early 1990.   ``Until we are convinced we have the best interests of ourpeople at heart, the reactors will not be restarted,'' Watkins toldemployees at the plant.   The energy secretary said it was important to delay the restart``to demonstrate to (the) American people ... that we know how tomanage nuclear technology.''   The 330-acre plant on the Georgia border manufactures tritium, aradioactive gas used to boost the explosive power of nuclearwarheads.   Shortly after the reactors were shut down, the department saidit could have them running again by late 1988. After that targetwas missed, the department told Congress it expected startup bylate this year.   The Pentagon warned of an imminent shortage of the vital nuclearmaterial, but that did not discourage Watkins from delaying theplant's restart.   While the nation's dwindling supply of tritium is a concern,``it's a matter of what steps we can take. The worst thing would bea preliminary start-up'' of the reactors, said U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn,D-Georgia, who accompanied Watkins on a morning tour of the plant.   Watkins said he believed the Savannah River Site, once back inoperation, would become the best-run facility among the country'snuclear weapons and power plants.   ``I can see us emerging here as the number one plant in thenation. That's my goal _ to have this plant be the flagship,''Watkins told employees at a meeting in the plant's cafeteria.   Numerous relevations surfaced about the plant last year,prompting its shutdown. Among them were concern over accidents, laxmanagement and policies that stressed production over safety.   Westinghouse Electric Corp. took over management of the plant onApril 1. Before that, it was operated and managed by chemical giantE.I. du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co., which built the plant 38 years ago.</TEXT></DOC>
