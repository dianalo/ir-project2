We will investigate allcomplaints in these areas and follow up.''   Cavazos said OCR also is doing compliance reviews based on pressreports and information from other sources. ``OCR will undertakeseveral compliance reviews this year just to look at this veryissue. We don't have to wait for a formal complaint,'' he said. Hedid not say which schools would be targeted.   A spokesman later said reviews prompted by questions aboutdiscriination against Asian-Americans currently are in progress atHarvard and the University of California at Los Angeles.   Concern over admission policies biased against Asian-Americanswas raised by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, chairman of theAppropriations subcommittee on labor, health and human services andeducation.   Harkin cited a Yale Law Journal article that discussed problemsat Brown University, OCR complaints against the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley and a California auditor-general's reportquestioning Berkeley admission policies. He asked Cavazos whetherhis department would be interested in starting a compliance reviewat Berkeley.   A Cavazos aide, deputy undersecretary Charles Kolb, told him itwould be up to OCR to follow up.   Later, OCR spokesman Gary Curran said OCR had received fourindividual complaints in the last two years about Berkeley, one ofwhich is still pending. He said no compliance review has beenundertaken because the university is ``involved in aself-evaluation.''   Curran cited the auditor-general report as well as a recentfaculty report noting Asians may be at a disadvantage in gainingadmission to the school. ``We are waiting to see what sort ofaction they take'' in response to the reports, he said.   Officials at Berkeley acknowledge that the law school has keptseparate waiting lists for Asians, blacks, Hispanics and nativeAmericans for a dozen years. They say the multiple lists are a wayfor minorities to gain representation in the incoming class.   Cavazos told Harkin that as a former college president, ``I knowthat it is important to have a diverse student body. I certainlyfavor greater opportunity for minority students. But discriminationagainst students merely because they are Asian-American is illegaland unacceptable.''</TEXT></DOC>
