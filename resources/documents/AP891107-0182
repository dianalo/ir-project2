Mitsotakis has three days to organize enough support to persuadePresident Christos Sartzetakis he can put together a Cabinet. If hefails, former Premier Andreas Papandreou will be given theexploratory mandate.   Mitsotakis's New Democracy Party came in first in elections lastSunday, but missed a parliamentary majority. It was the second timein five months Greeks went to the polls only to get an inconclusiveresult.   A third set of elections this year is likely if no leading partycan fashion a government. The standoff has delayed major decisionson the ailing economy and foreign policy.   A conservative-Communist alliance formed after elections in Junewas empowered only to investigate allegations of scandals inPapandreou's former administration.   ``In three days I will return to the president and inform him ofthe results of my efforts,'' Mitsotakis told a news conference.   He must marshal the support of 151 members of the 300-seatParliament to win approval of his government. New Democracy won 148seats last Sunday, Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement _known as PASOK _ won 128 and the Communist-led Coalition of theLeft and Progress won 21.   Mitsotakis faces tough going. PASOK and the Coalition ruled outteaming with New Democracy and one of the three independents isallied with the leftists.   But Mitsotakis said he expected to gain the seat won by anindependent environmentalist, citing a legal ambiguity that mayallow his party to contest the seat in a special electoral court.   He said he will not enter any alliance that will force his partyto water down its program to revive the economy and seek closerU.S. ties.   Papandreou was expected to appeal to the Coalition to join PASOKin a government.   If no coalition emerges, the president will offer the majorparties the chance to form a joint administration _ a proposalsupported by the Coalition.   If that fails, new elections will be called.   A New Democracy official, Ioannis Palaiokrassas, said theparties will try to avoid new elections.   ``I don't see new elections right now, for the simple reasonthat no ... (party) wants them, nor do the Greek people. Only inthe event of a total deadlock will we go to elections,'' he said.   New Democracy and the Coalition have said they will not repeattheir summer alliance as their programs are incompatible. Theirgovernment handed over to a caretaker administration in Octoberafter Parliament indicted Papandreou and five of his formerministers on charges of corruption.   More elections would not necessarily produce a stronggovernment. A proportional electoral system introduced by PASOKearlier this year makes it difficult for any party to win aparliamentary majority.   The new Parliament includes some celebrities. Actress and formerCulture Minister Melina Mercouri was re-elected on the PASOK ticket.   Leftist composer Mikis Theodorakis, who did the soundtrack forthe film ``Zorba the Greek,'' was elected running as a NewDemocracy candidate. A former Communist Party deputy, he announcedin October he was cooperating with the conservatives in a crusadeagainst urban terrorism.   Mitsotakis' daughter, Dora Bakoyannis, won overwhelmingly in themountainous constituency of Evritania. The seat was formerly heldby her husband, New Democracy spokesman Pavlos Bakoyannis, who wasmurdered by extreme-left urban guerrillas on Sept. 26.</TEXT></DOC>
