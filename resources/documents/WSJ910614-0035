Moreover, they disclosed to the House Banking Committeethat the latest estimates of the cost of the bank's failuremay grow far beyond the current estimates of $2.3 billion.The bank, which has been seen as a casualty of the region'sreal estate bust, previously had assets of $20 billion.</LP><TEXT>   Assets unfavorably classified by examiners have grown to$8 billion from $4.5 billion when the bank was seized inJanuary, James Barton, deputy director of the Office of theComptroller of the Currency, told the committee.   In the hands of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,&quot;these assets continue to show deterioration,&quot; he said. WhenRep. Jim Leach (R., Iowa), asked whether losses to the bankinsurance fund would grow at the same pace, Mr. Bartonresponded: &quot;That very well may happen.&quot;   The losses, moreover, were compounded by about $1 billionin wholesale deposits, placed by deposit brokers, that theBank of New England used as a source of liquidity in itsfinal months. These deposits lost no money when theinstitution failed, even though they weren't technicallyinsured. Thomas Cimeno, senior vice president of the FederalReserve Bank of Boston, said it was necessary to protectthose deposits, even if they were over the legal limit of$100,000. &quot;It's possible that other regional institutionsmight have seen an erosion of confidence,&quot; he said.   The committee seemed slightly taken aback as fiveregulators from the comptroller's office and the Feddescribed being caught off guard by the recession and thereal estate bust. Despite citing the bank in 1986 and 1987for underwriting problems, insufficient loan-loss allowances,and poor asset quality, regulators never pressed the bank'sboard for action, such as limiting growth, they said.   &quot;I am amazed at the answers to these questions,&quot; said JimNussle (R., Iowa). &quot;Why didn't you follow up?&quot;   &quot;We really tried to give the bank the benefit of thedoubt,&quot; said Joseph Hooks, who was in charge of one of the1989 exams by the comptroller's office. &quot;If a bank has ahistory of fairly good earnings, and you are dealing with adecent economy, it has a way of overriding poor underwritingstandards.&quot;   Mr. Barton said that &quot;looking back, we were not asproactive in this case as we should have been.&quot; He added, &quot;Webelieve that the management in that district took a morepositive stance on the economy than they should have taken,and they should have taken a more aggressive stance with theboard.&quot; Since then, he said, the comptroller's regulatoryteam in New England has been changed and augmented.</TEXT></DOC>
