Unlike some of our previous cases, most recently Bowsher v.Synar, this case simply does not pose a ``danger of congressionalusurpation of executive branch functions. Indeed, with theexception of the power of impeachment _ which applies to allofficers of the United States _ Congress retained for itself nopowers of control or supervision over an independent counsel.   Similarly, we do not think that the Act works any judicialusurpation of properly executive functions. ...   Finally, we do not think that the Act ``impermisssiblyundermines the powers of the executive branch, or ``disrupts theproper balance between the coordinate branches (by) prevent(ing)the executive branch from accomplishing its constitutionallyassigned functions. ...   The attorney general is not allowed to appoint the individual ofhis choice; he does not determine the counsel's jurisdiction; andhis power to remove a counsel is limited. Nonetheless, the Act doesgive the attorney general several means of supervising orcontrolling the prosecutorial powers that may be wielded by anindependent counsel. Most importantly, the attorney general retainsthe power to remove the counsel of ``good cause,'' a power that wehave already concluded provides the executive with substantialability to ensure that the laws are ``faithfuly executed'' byindependent counsel.   In sum, we conclude today that it does not violate theappointments clause for Congress to vest the appointment ofindependent counsels in the special division; that the powersexercised by the special division under the Act do not violateArticle III; and tht the Act does not violate the separation ofpowers principle by impermissibly interfering with the functions ofthe executive branch. The decision of the court of appeals istherefore reversed.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   Dissent by Judge Antonin Scalia:   The framers of the federal Constitution ... viewed the principleof separation of powers as the absolutely central guarantee of ajust government. ... Without a secure structure of separatedpowers, our Bill of Rights would be worthless, as the bills ofrights of many nations of the world that have adopted, or evenimproved upon, the mere words of ours.   That is what this suit is about. Power. The allocation of poweramong Congress, the president and the courts in such fashion as topreserve the equilibrium the Constitution sought to establish _ sothat ``a gradual concentration of the several powers in the samedepartment can effectively be resisted. Frequently an issue of thissort will come before the court clad, so to speak, in sheep'sclothing: the potential of the asserted principle to effectimportant change in the equilibrium of power is not immediatelyevident, and must be discerned by a careful and perceptiveanalysis. But this wolf comes as a wolf.   The context of this statute is acrid with the smell ofthreatened impeachment. Where, as here, a request for appointmentof an independent counsel has come from the Judiciary Committee ofeither house of Congress, the attorney general must, if he decidesnot to seek appointment, explain to that committee why.   Thus, by the application of this statute in the present case,Congress has effectively compelled a criminal investigation of ahigh-level appointee of the president in connection with hisactions arising out of a bitter power dispute between the presidentand the legislative branch.   The court devotes most of its attention to such relativelytechnical details as the appointments clause and the removal power,addressing briefly and only at the end of its opinion theseparation of powers. As my prologue suggests, I think that has itbackwards.   In sum, this statute does deprive the president of substantialcontrol over the prosecutory functions performed by the independentcounsel, and it does substantially affect the balance of powers.That the court could possibly conclude otherwise demonstrates boththe wisdom of our former constitutional system, in which the degreeof reduced control and political impairment were irrelevant, sinceall purely executive power had to be in the president; and thefolly of the new system of standardless judicial allocation ofpowers we adopt today.   The notion that every violation of law should be prosecuted,including _ indeed, especially _ every violation by those in highplaces, is an attracive one, and it would be risky to argue in anelection campaign that that is not an absolutely overriding value.Fiat justitia, ruat coelum. Let justice be done, though the heavensmay fall. ... By its short-sighted action today, I fear the courthas permanently encumbered the Republic with an institution thatwill do it great harm.   Worse than what it has done, however, is the manner in which ithas done it. A government of laws means a government of rules.Today's decision on the basic issue of fragmentation of executivepowers is ungoverned by rule, and hence ungoverned by law.</TEXT><HEAD>End text, two takes</HEAD></DOC>
