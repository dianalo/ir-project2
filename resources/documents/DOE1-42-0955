<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-42-0955 </DOCNO><TEXT>EGandamp;G Energy Measurements, Inc. operates the Remote Sensing Laboratoryfor the United States Department of Energy (USDOE). The Laboratory maintainseleven twin-engine aircraft, helicopters and fixed-wing, as aerial measurementplatforms. It has a $23 million annual budget and 214 personnel operatingat major facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Washington, D.C. Remotesensing technologies include: large area radiological mapping, high altitudeaerial photography, multispectral photography, multispectral aerial scanning,and airborne gas and particulate sampling. The Laboratory has developeda broad variety of remote sensing equipment; its personnel acquire, analyze,and report data to federal and state agencies. As a major technical resourceof the USDOE, the Laboratory plays a key role in the federal responseto a radiological emergency, particularly in the establishment of a FederalRadiological Monitoring and Assessment Center (FRMAC). Many sophisticatedsystems for acquisition and analysis are deployed to a FRMAC, along withan advanced communication system to link the participating local, state,and federal agencies. 6 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
