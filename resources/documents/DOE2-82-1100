During locating, the electromagnetic field produced by thetransmitter is plotted for at least three measuring points with the receiver.Apart from the field parameters the coordinates of each measuring point,obtained with the aid of the position transducer, are included in thecalculation. Graphic evaluation enables the transmitter position to beread off directly from the VDU. During trial measurements at TremoniaExperimental Mine in Dortmund the deviations from the actual transmitterlocation were less than 1 m despite unfavourable surrounding conditions,sufficiently accurate for a body-search.</TEXT></DOC>
