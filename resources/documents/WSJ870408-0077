The maker of plastics and electronic and avionic products said it bought the site, a plant in Vestal, New York, from Robintech Inc. of Annapolis, Md. The plant is used to make polyvinyl chloride pipe, which is used in construction. Robintech also used the plant to make polyvinyl chloride pipe, Buffton said.    A Buffton spokesman said the Environmental Protection Agency has reported that Buffton's operations at the site haven't significantly contributed to alleged pollution there. But, the company said, federal law makes Buffton a potentially responsible party for any cleanup that may need to be done.    A Buffton spokesman said the company wouldn't disclose the contents of the alleged chemical pollution at the site.    Buffton said Robintech has agreed to split the cost of the federally mandated study evenly. Buffton's share of the study cost would be about $400,000, the company said. The cost of eventual cleanup couldn't be estimated, Buffton said.    In the year-ago second quarter, ended March 31, 1986, the company had net income of $330,468, or 10 cents a share, on revenue of $10.3 million. The Buffton spokesman said the company expects to post a small profit for the 1987 second quarter after the charge. </TEXT></DOC>
