To create the documentsthat are currently submitted to FERC, it will be necessary to change thepitch of the printing within the document. Williston Basin points out thatfor portrait documents, the length of the header and trailer records exceedsthe boundaries for tariff sheet text and will require margin changes atthe top and bottom of each page. Northwest suggests that the trailer recordsare redundant and unnecessary since the header record can serve as thedelimiter for each page. ANR/CIG note a discrepancy between the maximumline lengths in the October 7, 1988 Commission Staff Response and the instructionsfor Schedule TF.In response to these comments, staff is eliminating all trailer recordsand reformatting the margin and page format information into four headerrecords. The revised header records have a maximum usable length of 65characters (limited by the number of characters allowable at 10 cpi pitchin Portrait orientation) and may be used with either Portrait or Landscapeorientation without changing the margins on each page. The printer pitchspecification is moved to Tariff Sheet Header Record No. 1, so that pitchcan be changed for individual sheets within a volume. In addition, a LineDensity Indicator is added so that tariff sheets can be printed at eithersix- or eight-lines per inch with appropriate fonts.The revised formats issued with this notice contain maximum characters/lineand lines/page values for 10 cpi, 12 cpi and 17 cpi pitch. However, staffwill consider additional pitch options for printing tariff sheets. Table1 lists the characters/line limits, up to a maximum pitch of 20 cpi, andlines/page limits for various print pitches at six and eight lines perinch. These limits are determined by margin and border requirements specifiedin the Commission's regulations, by the space needed to print informationin the margin, and by legibility considerations. Staff invites commentsat the conference on the need for and the feasibility of the additionalprint options, and the impact of these options on tariff sheets that wouldotherwise have to be reformatted.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 1._Character, Line and Blank Margins for Available Print Densities</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Maximum Values] </ITAG><H1>Pitch (cpi) </H1><H1>Inside border limits </H1><H2>Char/Line </H2><H2>Lines </H2><H3>(6/in.) </H3><H3>(8/in.) </H3><H1>Margins (excl. text) </H1> Portrait: <ITAG tagnum="2">10 <D>65 </D><D>50 </D><D>70 </D><D>Top: \1/2\ in. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">12 <D>79 </D><D>50 </D><D>70 </D><D>Bottom: \1/2\ in. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">15 <D>99 </D><D>50 </D><D>70 </D><D>Left: 1\1/4\ in. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">16.6 <D>110 </D><D>50 </D><D>70 </D><D>Right: \1/2\ in. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">17 <D>112 </D><D>50 </D><D>70 </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">20 <D>134 </D><D>50 </D><D>70 </D><D>  </D></ITAG>Landscape: <ITAG tagnum="2">10 <D>98 </D><D>31 </D><D>45 </D><D>Top: 1\1/4\ in. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">12 <D>118 </D><D>31 </D><D>45 </D><D>Bottom: \1/2\ in. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">15 <D>148 </D><D>31 </D><D>45 </D><D>Left: \1/2\ in. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">16.6 <D>163 </D><D>31 </D><D>45 </D><D>Right: \1/2\ in. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">17 <D>168 </D><D>31 </D><D>45 </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">20 <D>198 </D><D>31 </D><D>45 </D><D>  </D><F>Note._8.5 point print font will be used for: (1) 8 lines/inch print,and (2) 15, 16.6, 17 and 20 pitch print at 6 or 8 lines per inch. </F></ITAG></ITAG> Sheet Number and Tariff Volume Number in the header records are revisedfrom numeric to character fields in response to comments from Northwestand Enron. For tariff sheets that must be revised, this will allow additionalpages to be included with an alphabetic suffix. In response to comments submitted by Enron, staff clarifies that margindata included in the header records does not need to be repeated in thetext record. The Commission-provided software will print the border requiredon the hard copy and will print information from the header records inthe margin. However, there are several revisions to the current displayformat which are required to print tariff sheets filed on an electronicmedium. First, for sheets printed in Landscape orientation, margin informationwill be printed in the same orientation instead of the Portrait formatused in current hard copy filings. Top, bottom and side margins will berevised to accommodate the margin information for Landscape orientation.Second, for Portrait orientation at 10 cpi and 12 cpi pitch, the SupersededSheet Number will be printed on the line below the Tariff Volume ID andwill be right justified with the border. This change is due to the sizeof the items to be printed and the 65 and 79 character limits for 10 cpiand 12 cpi pitch, respectively. This revision will eliminate the need tochange print fonts within an individual tariff sheet. The same format forprinting information in the margin will be used for all other pitch, fontand orientation combinations. ANR/CIG question if footnotes must be included within the borders of thetariff sheet or be printed outside as is the current practice for somecompanies. In addition, marginal footnotes concerning information imposedby Commission order are printed at the bottom of the page on the currenthard copy. Will there be a separate marginal footnote record or will thistype of marginal note be acceptable in the footnote sequence at the endof the document? Staff responds that footnotes applicable to the text on a tariff sheetwill be printed within the borders for all companies. Footnote text, andall appropriate footnote reference numbers, should be included as partof the regular text for each tariff sheet, i.e., there is no special recordformat for entering footnotes. If a tariff sheet is filed to comply witha Commission order, and Order Date and Docket Number are entered on TariffSheet Header Record 4, then the following message will be printed in thebottom margin as specified by Commission regulation: <ITAG tagnum="15">``Issued to comply with order of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,Docket No.      , dated      ''</ITAG>Enron questions how the Navy Document Interchange Format (DIF) is to beused by the Commission and whether header records apply to this formator only to ASCII files. Enron also notes that older versions of word processingsoftware do not provide a conversion utility to Navy DIF.Staff notes that the Commission cannot require that specific word processingsoftware be used to submit tariff filings. For this reason, staff couldconsider only generic file formats such as ASCII and Navy DIF. Furthermore,a single format for submittal of tariff sheets will simplify the developmentand use of microcomputer-based systems for tariff sheet control and inquiry/searchfunctions. Therefore, output from specific word processing software, withoutconversion, will not be acceptable.Staff considered Navy DIF because of its concern that special print features,such as underlining and bold-face print, are not preserved in an ASCIIfile. Commission regulations do not require that these features be includedin tariff sheets. If it is acceptable to natural gas companies and thepublic to submit tariff sheets without these features, then an ASCII fileis acceptable to staff. If certain special features are necessary or desirable,then Navy DIF may be an acceptable alternative to an ASCII file. Staffrecognizes, however, that Navy DIF is not a universal solution and that,after testing, limits might have to be placed on the use of that format.Staff clarifies that header records will be required regardless of theformat adopted by the Commission.Enron notes that the 144 byte limit for all records submitted on tape isinconsistent with the maximum length of 170 characters stated in the StaffResponse and asks if this limit also applies to diskettes. ANR/CIG questionwhether tariff filings can be submitted on tape or diskette, since theStaff Response stated that it will be less burdensome on industry and staffif pipelines submit tariffs on diskette only.Staff clarifies that the byte limit should have corresponded to the maximumlength stated in the Staff Response. That maximum length is revised to168 characters but may be increased after the conference discussion onprint options. Staff intends to develop a microcomputer-based system forcontrol of tariff sheets. For this reason, staff prefers that tariff sheetsbe filed on diskette. However, pipelines may file tariffs on magnetic tapeor cartridge, as well as diskettes.ANR/CIG state that certain tariff sheets will need new formats due to theproposed Maximum Line Length and questions if the filing fee and noticeprocedure apply if the new formats do not require changes to the existingtariff. ANR/CIG also ask whether the new tariff sheets must be providedto all holders of the tariff when the sheets are filed, and whether theCommission will issue an order accepting the tariff sheets with the newformats despite the fact that there have been no changes in the tariffprovisions.Staff clarifies that all current regulations with respect to filing fees,notice procedure, service, and the requirement for a Commission order acceptingthe tariff sheets will apply to all tariff sheets filed on an electronicmedium.ANR/CIG ask if only tariff sheets should be included on the electronicmedium and not other materials such as the Statement of Reasons and thetransmittal letter. ANR/CIG state that these ancillary materials shouldnot be required to be included on tape or diskette since there is not arecord in Schedule TF for submitting such data.Staff agrees that the transmittal letter and Statement of Reasons are notrequired to be included on the electronic medium.<ITAG tagnum="85">Appendix C_Revisions to Certificate Application Record Formats</ITAG>The certificate application record formats are revised to include an expandedGeneral Information Record and summary records for various types of certificateapplications.
