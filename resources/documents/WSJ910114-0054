Steven A. Seelig, director of the FDIC's liquidationdivision, said the FDIC legal staff will make arecommendation at an FDIC board meeting tomorrow on whetherthe deposit insurer should extend coverage to about $2.7million in deposits by those groups.</LP><TEXT>   The nonprofit groups, which include churches and charitiesin Harlem and Brooklyn as well as the United Negro CollegeFund and the National Urban League, are part of a largergroup of 105 depositors that had losses when the FDICliquidated Freedom National Bank last November.   The 31 nonprofit agencies and another 74 businesses,individuals and government agencies had deposits totaling $15million that exceeded the FDIC's $100,000 per depositorinsurance limit, FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said.Previously, the FDIC agreed to reimburse Freedom's uninsureddepositors for 50% of the amount of their deposits thatexceeded the $100,000 coverage limit.   Demands from New York members of Congress for fullcoverage of Freedom's depositors increased last week afterthe FDIC covered all uninsured deposits in units of Bank ofNew England Corp.   However, Mr. Seelig said the FDIC's consideration ofadditional coverage of accounts held by the nonprofit groupsbegan before the failure of Bank of New England. He said thereview came in response to legal questions about the coverageof deposits by nonprofit groups raised in a Dec. 13 letterfrom New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams.   Mr. Abrams argued that accounts set up by nonprofit groupsshould qualify as charitable trusts that are eligible forfull coverage because their assets are held in trust for manybeneficiaries.   Mr. Whitney said the review also addresses &quot;what purposesthe funds were assigned to and what separate entities they'reallocated to.&quot; For example, he said, it could be argued thatthe United Negro College Fund held funds in trust forseparate colleges and universities.   Mr. Seelig said that these legal questions haven't beenraised in previous bank liquidations.   In a separate issue involving Freedom National, Mr. Seeligsaid an opportunity still exists to start a newminority-owned bank in Harlem by selling the remaining assetsand deposits of Freedom National Bank to local investors.   Mr. Seelig said he wrote a letter Dec. 26 outlining thisoffer to Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D., N.Y.), whose districtincludes Harlem. &quot;If we don't hear from anybody we'replanning to put the loans out on the market for bids sometimeduring the second half of January, so we are running out oftime,&quot; Mr. Seelig said.</TEXT></DOC>
