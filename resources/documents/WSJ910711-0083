The International Olympic Committee ended apreposterously hypocritical boycott that lasted 21 years,while the East German police state rolled up gold medals andgunned down anyone trying to escape to the West. Yesterday,President Bush announced that South Africa had met theconditions laid down by Congress for the lifting of somesanctions on trade and travel. Maybe South Africa's whitesendured some degree of discomfort from the sanctions. Therecan be little question, however, that sanctions caused theblack population of South Africa to suffer terribly.   You cannot overestimate South Africa's difficulties. It istrying to abandon authoritarian rule while avoiding tribaldomination. It faces escalating violence and a 40%unemployment rate brought on in part by the sanctions. Theeconomy shrank by 1% in 1990 and will contract further.Independent economists say that if economic growth doesn'tcome quickly, South Africa will be ungovernable by 1995.</LP><TEXT>   While the resumption of U.S. trade with South Africa iswelcome, it's unfortunate that Mr. Bush left in place whatmany consider the most destructive sanctions -- a ban on U.S.support for International Monetary Fund loans to SouthAfrica. Access to the IMF is symbolically important; withoutit, private investors aren't likely to provide the loans andinvestments to create the 10,000 jobs a week that are neededjust to keep pace with population growth. Durban, one of theworld's fastest growing cities, has 1.7 million squatters,who outnumber the city's official residents. We hopePresident Bush will find it possible to lift the sanction onIMF loans to South Africa once Congress passes theadministration's IMF funding request.   It's also worth noting Mr. Bush's call for local U.S.governments and private groups to follow his lead and abandontheir own sanctions. Remember all those cities, collegeinvestment funds and the like that triumphantly &quot;divested&quot;themselves out of South Africa? It turns out that once pastthe great symbolic act, many of them never bothered torevisit this issue. Many cities have actually kept sanctionsin place against South Africa's former colony of Namibia,despite the fact that Namibia has had a majority-blackelected government for 16 months.   U.S. foreign-policy types have had a bad habit of treatingeconomies as barely relevant to their schemes. Sanctionsdidn't force South Africa to reform. Instead, a steadybrain-drain of emigrants plus unrest in the townshipsconvinced the world's investors and the white regime thatSouth Africa couldn't survive in the modern world unless itended the archaic oppression of apartheid. Black leadersprivately admit that while the sanctions played a trivialrole in bringing reforms, they added significantly to theeconomic suffering of blacks. Every reliable poll alwaysfound that a majority of black South Africans opposedsanctions.   The United States has now begun to show a new maturity inits relations with South Africa. And as Mr. Bush notedyesterday, the U.S. understands that the African NationalCongress and the white government can't be the only playersin the negotiations to create a new South Africa. The morethe U.S. encourages a transition to a genuine multi-racialdemocracy rather than a mere transfer of power, the brighterSouth Africa's future will become.</TEXT></DOC>
