But President Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev won't be invited this time unless they can show they're the next Rodgers and Hammerstein.    The first-ever &quot;Songwriters' Summit,&quot; subtitled &quot;Music Speaks Louder than Words,&quot; is designed to create harmony between 20 American pop composers and a contingent of Soviet tunesmiths in Moscow starting Oct. 24. Coordinators say the event is a new way to promote world peace. It also may be a new way to promote a record album that sponsors hope will emerge from the 10-day event.    Robyn Whitney, a U.S. recording-studio owner helping to organize the summit, says the musicians will steer clear of politics in their songs. Instead, she says, the songs that the composers produce jointly probably will concentrate on subjects common to both Americans and Soviets, such as &quot;love won, love lost, love unrequited.&quot;    Summit organizers say that among the artists expressing interest in recording summit-produced songs are Judy Collins, Waylon Jennings and Cyndi Lauper, and Russian rock groups Autograf and Time Machine. The organizers hope enough artists will be interested to produce at least one album-followed, perhaps, by an internationally televised concert. All the composers have agreed that 25% of any proceeds will go to the American Field Service Intercultural Exchange, an organization that coordinates foreign exchange programs with youths and host families.    The summit's progenitor, Alan Roy Scott, whose compositions include work on the film scores for &quot;Top Gun&quot; and &quot;Coming to America,&quot; says sponsors hope to treat participants to a &quot;glasnost rap&quot; featuring rap star L.L. Cool J. &quot;Music gets right to the core,&quot; he says. &quot;It's something that can cut through the red tape.&quot;    Michael Masser, whose songs include &quot;The Greatest Love of All,&quot; says, &quot;Now is the time for both countries to realize that they cannot continue in a warlike atmosphere.&quot; Then he adds, sounding like he's already got a song title in mind, &quot;Music is leading me to Russia.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
