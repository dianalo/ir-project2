(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A couple has accused Nissan Motor Corp.and a Japanese man who lived in their home of spying on them tocollect information on Americans' buying habits.   In a Superior Court lawsuit, Maritza and Stephen French claimfraud, invasion of privacy, trespassing and unfair businesspractices against Nissan and Takashi Morimoto, a Nissan employeewho rented a room in their Costa Mesa home last summer.   The family learned of Morimoto's mission in October, when theLos Angeles Times reported that Morimoto was sent to Costa Mesa aspart of an effort to design a future car model designed especiallyfor the U.S. market.   The lawsuit filed Thursday seeks a court order forbidding Nissanfrom dispatching alleged corporate emissaries into the homes ofother unsuspecting families. It also seeks unspecified damages.   ``They just feel outraged,'' said Nancy Kaufman, the French'sattorney. ``They just wonder what he was writing down, what abouttheir private lives is in a Nissan file somewhere. They feelviolated.''   The complaint alleges that Morimoto, 29, ``intentionallymisrepresented and concealed'' the reason for his six-week staywith the couple and their two daughters.   A spokesman for Nissan Motor Corp. in Carson said he could notcomment because the firm had yet to receive the lawsuit.   The lawsuit also named as defendants Makoto Tachikawa, a productstrategy director for Nissan, and two firms allegedly involved inplacing Morimoto in the French household.   Ms. Kaufman said the episode began when the French familyresponded to a newspaper advertisement to find homes for Japanesestudents. The placement services said no students were availablebut suggested Morimoto, who moved in on June 16.</TEXT></DOC>
