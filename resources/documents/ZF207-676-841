 Whatapplications will best demonstrate the IS department's contribution to theorganization?&quot;andM;* &quot;What applications will help our organization carry out its strategy andachieve its goals?andP;  What applications can help our organization create newstrategy?&quot;andM;As increasing numbers of companies embark on strategic information systemsplanning exercises, these questions and others like them are being repeatedlyraised by IS executives.andP;  Four academic surveys in the last seven years haveeach shown that strategic IS planning heads the long list of IS execs'pressing concerns.andM;We report here on our recent study, which showed where 80 companies, whichhad completed IS planning, most often stumbled and fell.andM;Above all, strategic IS planning means developing a long-range plan forautomating business functions.andP;  Such a plan involves identifying which taks,if computerized, would most help the organization realize its strategy andbusiness objectives.andP;  Such a plan also includes initiating computerizedapplications to help the organization create new strategy.andM;Strategic IS planning also entails convincing top management and usermanagement to use expensive computer resources for optimal applications.andP;  Itmeans making promises and commitments that will expand the IS department'svisibility throughout the organization.andM;What Most Companies DoandM;Despite the considerable time and money companies are spending to createlong-range strategic systems plans, IS planners, executives and topmanagement often finish such studies with a sense of disappointment anddissatisfaction.andM;To develop a strategic IS plan, an organization usually first evaluates anumber of existing planning methodologies.andP;  IBM's Business Systems Planning,Robert Holland's Strategic Systems Planning and James Martin's InformationEngineering are among the most popular of these approaches.andP;  The organizationthen generally selects one or customizes its own hybrid approach.andM;In beginning a major, intensive study using the chosen methodology, anorganization sets up a committee of users and IS specialists.andP;  It relies onthe methodology vendor's training classes to help these people get startedand depends on the vendor's consulting support to further guide the study andaudit the results.andM;Next, the committee carries out the multiple phases of the study, generallylasting several weeks or months.andP;  It uses existing business data andinterviews with executives to define its current business processes and itsclasses of data.andP;  It also studies how existing information systems supportthose processes.andM;Using its understanding of existing business processes, data classes andcurrent IS support, the committee identifies the data bases of the future.andO;It works with management to set priorities for data base development based onpotential financial and intangible benefits.andP;  Finally, it prepares a reportthat includes the long-range plan, with recommendations for a network ofcomputers, communications equipment, hardware and software, plus newmanagement policies and an implementation schedule.andM;What Most Companies Should DoandM;To learn about strategic IS planning, we presented a list of 49 potentialproblems, which we had culled from published articles dealing with the topic,to the IS planners of the 80 companies.andP;  We asked them to rate the importanceof each problem in the planning process.andP;  (Further details of this survey canbe found in &quot;The Implementation of Strategic Information Systems PlanningMethodologies,&quot; MIS Quarterly, September 1988, p.andP;  389.)andM;All of the points listed below were cited by at least 25% of surveyrespondents as an &quot;extreme&quot; or &quot;major&quot; problem.andP;  They appear in order oftheir severity.andP;  We have attemped to interpret each problem and to suggesthow planners might alternatively conduct a successful strategic IS planningstudy.andM;Probably the most disturbing finding was that over half of the respondentsrated the statement &quot;it is difficult to secure top management commitment forimplementing the plan&quot; as an extreme or major problem.andP;  This statementimplies that, once the company's study was complete and the long-range planwas in writing, it was a struggle to convince top management to authorize thedevelopment of the applications the plan described.andM;This resposne implies that top management might not understand the plan ormight lack confidence in the IS department's ability to carry it out.andP;  Moreimportant, it suggests that those who are about to embark on such an endeavorshould assess in advance the likelihood that their top management will refuseto fund their plan.andP;  It further suggests that planners should determine aheadof time the actions they might take to ensure funding and to prevent the planfrom collecting dust on a bookshelf.andM;The next most severe problem, cited by 46% of the respondents, was that&quot;implementing the projects and the data architecture identified in the planrequires substantial further analysis.&quot;andP;  This means that the planningmethodology often fails to provide the programming, or even the functional,specifications needed to start designing and programming the individualapplications.andM;Hence, prospective strategic IS planners should seek a methodology thatprovides a procedure to ease them into implementation.andP;  Some vendors offersuch methodologies.andP;  Alternatively, planners should be prepared for thefrustration of needing more analysis before beginning systems development.andM;The next two problems cited as severe by 41% and 37% of respondents,respectively, were, one, that the success of the methodology is greatlydependent on the team leader and, two, that it is difficult to find a teamleader who meets the criteria specified by the methodology.andM;If the team leader can't convince top management to support the study orcan't use a top management mandate to convince user management toparticipate, the study probably is doomed.andP;  To have sufficient clout, theteam leader must be a respected veteran in the organization's business and adynamic leader comfortable with contemporary technology.andP;  Such people arescarce and must be chosen carefully.andM;To minimize the effects of a poor choice, reduce the project's dependency onthe leader, if possible.andP;  This can be accomplished by obtaining as muchvisible top management support as possible or by using a methodology that isso well structured and well defined that it makes the team leader's job easy.andM;Thirty-six percent of respondents had a problem with the methodology lackingsufficient computer support.andP;  Strategic IS planning produces reams ofreports, charts, matrices and diagrams--a volume of data that can't bemanaged efficiently and effectively without automated support.andP;  In fact, theexpense of developing the computer support in house might sway the decisionin favor of buying a methodology.andM;Consequently, if you purchase an existing methodology, carefully check outthe vendor's computer support.andP;  Examine the screens and reports.andP;  If youdevelop your own methodology, don't underestimate the need for such support.andM;Precisely one-third of respondents found it a problem that the planningexercise took weeks or even months, possibly because that timespan is wellbeyond the attention span of many organizations.andM;Business managers often expect results soon and can lose interest if theexercise drags on.andP;  Moreover, the organization can change even during theplanning period.andP;  Most important, a time overrun during the planning exercisemight reduce top management's confidence in the IS department's ability tocarry out the final long-range plan.andP;  Keep the duration of the planning studyshort.andM;Survey respondents also said that not only is it difficult to convince topmanagement to implement the plan it is difficult to convince top managementeven to fund the planning study.andP;  Planning exercises are slow and costly.andM;Planners should have cogent arguments prepared for use in battling forplanning funds, offering, if possible, a set of concrete goals that thestudy, and resulting revised systems, will achieve.andM;The next problem, cited by 30% of respondents, was that &quot;the strategicinformation systems plan fails to include an overall personnel and trainingplan for the IS department.&quot;andM;Chances are that permanent IS planners will be needed, plus additional dataadministrators, data communications specialists, programmers and analysts.andP;  Astrategic IS plan must allocate the time and resources needed for these newpersonnel and their training.andM;While not ranked as severe a problem as finding the right team leader, 30% ofrespondents said &quot;it is difficult to find team members who meet the criteriaspecified by the methodology.&quot;andM;Qualified team members, indeed, are scare.andP;  Participants from the user sideneed to feel comfortable with inforamtion technology, while team members fromthe IS department need to understand the business.andM;Carefully check the credentials and schedules of prospective team members tobe certain that they have the necessary, refined communications skills andthe time to participate fully.andM;Some respondents (29%) ran into difficulty over the fact that the strategicIS plan failed to include an overall financial plan for the IS department.andO;The long-range plan must contain defensible projections for costs andbenefits because top management will demand, scrutinize and probably evenchallenge these projections.andM;Echoing a sentiment similar to that addressed in the second most severeproblem cited, 28% of respondents said &quot;the documentation does not adequatelydescribe the steps that should be followed for implementing the methodology.&quot;andO;The documentation describing many proprietary information systems planningmethodologies too often contains erroneous, ambiguous or contradictorydirections.andP;  As a result, a proprietary methodology should be read carefullybefore anyone signs the purchase contract.andP;  If you develop your ownmethodology, be prepared to devote significant energy to its documentation.andM;Just over a quarter of the users were also unhappy with the failure of moststrategic IS plans to provide priorities for developing specific data bases.andM;Top management and user management must agree with the plan's data basepriorities.andP;  The kinds of questions that must be answered in concert include:Should the organization now build a marketing data base, a financial database or a production data base?andP;  Which should be done first and which canwait?andM;Without top management agreement on the priorities of the targeted databases, the plan will never be executed.andP;  Without user management'sconcurrence, there will be many battles to change the priorities.andP;  Suchchanges can temporarily halt ongoing projects, while starting others.andP;  Therisk is evident: everything gets started, but nothing gets finished.andM;Despite the fact that a major objective of many strategic IS planningmethodologies is to determine an overall data architecture, 27% ofrespondents were disappointed with the final architecture's identification ofspecific data bases and with the links between them.andP;  They felt, for example,that the plan should determine whether the architecture will include apersonnel data base.andP;  It should also say whether the employees' SocialSecurity numbers or identification numbers in that data base should be tiedto the payroll, health insurance or sales force data bases.andP;  To manyrespondents, the long-range plan's portfolio of applications was piecemealand disjointed.andP;  Check to be sure that the methodology will provide anintegrated architecture and not jut a list of applications.andM;The last four problems were cited as extreme or severe by 26% of respondents.andM;One, they found the planning exercise quite expensive in that it demanded anexorbitant number of hours from top management, user management and IS.andO;These are often the organization's busiest, most productive and mostexpensive managers, precisely the men and women who do not have the time todevote to the study.andM;IS planners should be prepared to convince management that the planning studyis both essential and well worth the time demanded from its top people.andM;Two, because the IS planners surveyed seemed to feel that a permanent ISplanning group is essential, they were disappointed that their planningendeavors failed to establish one.andM;The strategic IS planning exercise should be viewed as just a beginning.andP;  Theteam should seriously consider a permanent planning function in the ISdepartment.andM;Three, the same number of respondents expressed concern about the time andexpense involved in hiring the signficant number of support personnel whowere required during the study for gathering and analyzing data about theorganization's business processes and IS support.andM;Planners should be a bit skeptical if the vendor of the methodology suggeststhat staff support will be negligible.andP;  Moreover, it may be necessary to padthe planning study budget a bit for staff support.andM;Even though long-range strategic IS-plans typically call for the expansion ofdata bases, the final problem cited by 26% of the group was that thestrategic IS plan failed to address sufficiently the need for expanded dataadministration in the organization.andM;In many organizations, the data administration function has growndramatically in recent years.andP;  It may continue to expand, yet theimplications of this necessary growth can be easy to ignore.andP;  The long-rangeplan should spell out the role and scope of the data administrationorganization for the future.andM;Strategic IS planning is necessary if an organization is ever to realize thepotential for information systems to contribute to its successful operation,much less increase the scope of that success.andP;  Moreover, the consequences offailing to strategically plan information systems can be severe.andM;The task presents a challenge because it requires top and user management tobe guided through arduous endeavors in an environment of uncertain businessconditions and technological change.andM;We trust that the experiences of the 80 surveyed companies will illuminatethe necessity, and reduce the challenge, of being better strategic ISplanners.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
