That does not, however, give them the right to abuse us. I'dlike to fill you in on some of the things I've done for tenants.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PROPERTY MANAGERS' WALL-TO-WALL WOES  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     I have counseled you on everything from bankruptcy to intimacy. I havecleaned blood off the walls after a suicide. I have found corpses in varyingstates of decay, helped Alzheimer's sufferers find everything from theirtelephone to their teeth, and taken apart your sink because you lost yourcontact lenses and thought they might be in there. I have talked to you aboutyour loud sex, your loud stereo, your out-of-control children and your barkingdog. I've had to inform you that it is against the city ordinance to keeppigs, goats or poisonous snakes in your apartment.;    I have witnessed theeffects of alcohol abuse, drug abuse, child abuse, spouse abuse and just aboutevery other form of abuse there is. I have worked on your behalf with the FBI,the U.S. Treasury Department, as well as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms. I've had residents who were pedophiles, pyromaniacs, rapists,poachers, convicted child abusers and armed robbers. But through it all, Ihave tried to be respectful.;    Remember, when you leave your job to go homeat night, you can put it all behind you. When we go home, we're still atwork.;    -- Managing in Chicago;    DEAR MANAGING -- On behalf of all thepeople in your field, thanks for an eye-opener and a mouth-closer.;    DEARANN -- I teach a wedding planning seminar. Recently I was asked a question Icouldn't answer. Can you help?;    While going through some old Christmasdecorations, Mrs. X found a box with 30 handwritten thank-you notes from herdaughter's wedding, which had been held 18 months before. The other thank-younotes were mailed, but somehow this box had been overlooked. Some people whosegifts were not acknowledged had telephoned and asked if their gifts had beenreceived. The bride's mother said yes and assured them they would receive aproper acknowledgment shortly.;    Mrs. X is planning the wedding of anotherdaughter and isn't sure if she should mail the overlooked notes for fear thatit might appear as if she is asking for more gifts for the upcoming wedding.Mrs. X thought perhaps she would send a note explaining what happened andenclose the original thank-you note in its original envelope. I thought thiswas a good idea.;    -- Utica;    DEAR UTICA -- Mrs. X should send the oldthank-you notes along with an apology and a brief explanation. A thank-younote, no matter how late, is better than no note.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ann Landers column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910810  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  498  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday August 10, 199100223200,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
