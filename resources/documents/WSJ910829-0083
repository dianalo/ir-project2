The PRI came into existence in 1929 with the purpose ofproviding a sense of legitimacy and introducing a civilizednote of order into the presidential succession, decided up tothen by the bullets of revolutionary generals. Madero, PanchoVilla, Zapata and Carranza -- the great &quot;caudillos,&quot; orpolitical leaders, of the 1910-20 civil war -- had all beenassassinated. After Obregon was assassinated in a 1928 bidfor re-election, Gen. Plutarco Elias Calles integrated thesurviving military men and their regional clientele withinthe PRI.</LP><TEXT>   Calles himself elected his successor, Lazaro Cardenas,entrusting the PRI with the task of winning (or stealing orinventing) votes for the chosen candidate. The screws ofpower were tightened by Cardenas when he integrated into thePRI not only the military and the civil servants but also thepeasant associations and the trade unions.   The arrangement has remained more or less intact eversince. And through a prodigal use of public funds and a hostof legal and illegal methods that range from legitimatepersuasion to coercion and fraud, the machinery of the PRImakes sure that the votes of the supposed electors inregional and local elections coincide with the vote of thereal elector: the all-powerful president who, all the wayback to Calles, has been anointed by his predecessor.   There usually are no mishaps, because the economic livesof all civil servants (four million), of the majority ofpeasants (whose plots of land, or &quot;ejidos&quot;, belong to thegovernment) and of most of the workers (controlled by thepowerful Confederation of Mexican Workers, or CTM) aredirectly or indirectly dependent on the PRI. It is no matterof chance that in its 62 years, the PRI has only once lostthe governorship of one of the 31 states.   The first earthquake to shake the PRI's structure occurredin 1968. The massacre of hundreds of students demonstratedthe limits of the &quot;Mexican miracle.&quot; A new middle class hademerged and was demanding basic political rights. Just as theeconomy had to be opened up to free internationalcompetition, so the political system needed to be opened tothe free competition of parties and opinions.   Unfortunately, two successive populist administrations(those of Luis Echeverria and Jose Lopez Portillo) preferredto reaffirm the old model of the integrative party, invadingthe economic sector and converting the state into anentrepreneur. Between 1973 and 1983 employment in the publicsector rose 550% while the government proudly nationalizedeverything from banks to cabarets. The result was bankruptcy.   Before 1982, the opposition in Mexico had been impotent.Since its founding in 1939, the quixotic Party of NationalAction (PAN) -- urban, middle class and with Christian ties-- put up with several frauds against it. The PAN'sdemoralization reached its lowest point in 1976, when itwithdrew from the presidential election so as not to be seenas the &quot;loyal opposition&quot; of the PRI. On the other side ofthe spectrum, opposition from the left -- always small inthis Catholic country -- had traditionally taken up arms andnot the vote.   All of this changed in 1982, when the large modern sectorof society calculated the cost of obedience to the PRI. Thissector began to understand that the PRI is not a party butthe electoral arm of the government; that corruption,non-productivity and waste are all inseparable from thesystem of party-government; and that these evils can becombatted only through a dual reform of economic andpolitical liberation.   The Mexican &quot;perestroika&quot; was initiated by PresidentMiguel de la Madrid, and it has been carried further withgreat success by his disciple and successor, Carlos Salinasde Gortari. Yet both have been stained by the politics ofold. Under the rule of Mr. de la Madrid, the customary fraudscontinued and provoked widespread condemnation.   For his part, Mr. Salinas has declared on severaloccasions that Mexico's perestroika should come before its&quot;glasnost&quot;. Last week's midterm elections for congressmen,senators and governors confirm this. With the government asboth arbitrator and interested party, relying as always ongenerous public funds for its campaigns, the old-style PRIhas entered into the cybernetic age of electoralmanipulation. A treatise could be written on thesophisticated methods used to adulterate the supposedly freeand secret vote.   What would a U.S. or Canadian voter think if he were todiscover at the entrance to the voting booth an individualdemanding to know his voting preference? This was a frequentoccurrence, for example, in the elections in the state ofGuanajuato.   To support their candidate -- a bureaucrat dogged byrumors of corruption -- the PRI squandered public funds on anextremely expensive campaign that mobilized peasants as ifthey were political cattle: They were transported, fed,pampered, persuaded and threatened so that they would votefor him. The PAN candidate, a charismatic and independententrepreneur, calculated that his successful campaign hadgiven him victory. But the government has announced thetriumph of the PRI, which goes to show that taking turns inoffice -- even on the local level -- is practicallyimpossible in Mexico.   Personally, I believe that even given impeccable electionsthe PRI would have won a large proportion of the races forsenator, representative and governor -- but not in the stateof San Luis Potosi, and certainly not in Guanajuato. Theexcellent performance of President Salinas in economicmatters and in social assistance to those Mexicans most inneed was a decisive factor.   Yet as it actually occurred, the victory of the&quot;PRInosaur&quot; seems rather Pyrrhic: It will demoralize PANmembers and will radicalize those on the left who have neverreally understood the advantages of the ballot over thebullet. More important, it will deepen the grievances ofthose in the vast modern sector of Mexican society who refuseto submit themselves to a political regime characterized bylies, illegality and the use of public funds for politicalends.   This unsatisfied sector does not believe that politicalreform should be postponed in favor of economic reform; itargues that the success of the latter is impossible withoutthe former. More than anything else, this broad segment ofconscientious citizens increasingly is demanding theseparation of the PRI from the government. At the end of the20th century, when democracy has spread all over the world,Mexico cannot go on being governed by an antediluvianmonster.   ---   Mr. Krauze is co-editor of Vuelta, a Mexican literarymagazine.
