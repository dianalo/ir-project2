(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Targon OfficeandM;LIKE MANY OTHER vendors, Nixdorf Computer has seen its profitability sufferas users have shifted from proprietary systems to Unix and other standards.andO;After two years of searching to profit in a standards-dominated market,Nixdorf thinks it has found a way.andP;  The company will acquire and/or buildUnix products and technologies and integrate them into solutions, providingusers with hand-holding and service.andP;  To support this strategy, Nixdorf isbuilding an office applications platform that allows it to integrate avariety of tools and applications in a distributed environment: the NixdorfComputer Office Architecture (NCOA).andM;In one sense, Nixdorf's platform strategy is not unique.andP;  Digital Equipment,Hewlett-Packard, Unisys, IBM, Data General, and virtually every major Unixplatform vendor is building modular, distributed software services--mail,calendar, file, print, communications, workstation integration--to supportcomplex application environments.andP;  But Nixdorf doesn't intend to competestrictly as a platform vendor.andP;  The company seeks a return to its golden daysas a single source of solutions and service.andP;  Nixdorf will license theproducts it develops to OEMs, but primarily as a way to get its softwareported to a variety of platforms.andP;  In North America, Nixdorf expects thelion's share of its earnings to come not from hardware and software sales,but from the design, consulting, and support services it provides along withthe boxes and wares.andP;  NCOA will succeed if it helps Nixdorf pull togethersolutions for customers.andP;  Nixdorf is ambitious, but seems to understandwhat's needed to reach its goal.andM;New Design forandM;a New EraandM;The Nixdorf Computer Office Architecture is to Nixdorf what ApplicationsIntegration Architecture (AIA) is to Digital Equipment Corporation andSystems Application Architecture (SAA) is to IBM.andP;  NCOA defines a platform ofmodular services that can be distributed across a network of heterogeneousdevices.andP;  NCOA is based on standards wherever they exist, both de jure and defacto.andP;  NCOA employs the client-server design for distributed computing.andO;That is, applications code runs on client workstations, and taps servers togain access to mail, printing, communications, filing, and other servicescommon to all applications.andM;NCOA accomplishes this design using an object-oriented approach.andP;  Itstructures applications, services, and physical resources as objects, each ofwhich knows what functions it can perform when asked by another object to doso.andP;  Objects in NCOA interact by sending one another messages, requests,commands, and data.andP;  The result is an inherently flexible system.andP;  New users,applications, services, and resources can be added without complexreconfiguring of the network.andP;  The new elements are simply registered, andthe other resources are notified of their existence.andM;Flexibility is the first advantage of the object-oriented approach todistributed environments.andP;  The second is task and procedural automation.andO;Because the integration of complex resources is accomplished by allowing twoobjects to pass messages, interactions between objects can be encoded inautomated procedures.andP;  NCOA provides a language to do this.andM;Does all of this sound familiar?andP;  It should.andP;  Object orientation iseveryone's model for a distributed applications environment.andP;  Nixdorf's NCOAshares a common heritage and common features with environments fromHewlett-Packard, Digital, Unisys, and others.andP;  The difference is in Nixdorf'sprocedural automation language and corporate strategy.andP;  Again, Nixdorf'spurpose in designing this environment is to help it win as an integrator.andM;A Turnkey HeritageandM;Nixdorf grew to become a $3 billion company primarily by selling turnkeybanking, telecommunications, and retail proprietary systems, mostly for theEuropean market.andP;  Nixdorf recognized that it had to shift to a standards baseyears ago; the Unix-based Targon product line was launched in 1986.andP;  But thetransition has been rough.andP;  Until recently, software for the line wasadequate but not particularly innovative.andP;  Nixdorf's office automationmarketing has also been unfocused.andP;  The Nixdorf U.S.andP;  and U.K.andP;  subsidiariessell Uniplex II Plus.andP;  In Europe, Nixdorf is focusing its sales efforts onTargon Office 2.0, which is based in part on a subset of Quadratron's Qliqoffice software suite.andP;  Before Targon Office 2.0, Nixdorf resold Quadratron'sQ-Office in Europe.andP;  The result: a slow transition from its proprietary baseto a new standards base.andP;  Nixdorf's profits nose-dived by 140 percent between1987 and 1988.andP;  The results from the first nine months of this year: revenuegrowth of 5 percent and a loss of 168 million marks.andP;  Consequently, NixdorfChairman Klaus Luft resigned last November.andM;Nixdorf clearly had to do more to differentiate its Unix products in order toprofit from them.andP;  Its strategy is to substitute Unix for its proprietarybase in building turnkey solutions and to integrate its own products as wellas those of other vendors.andP;  Nixdorf prefers handling every aspect of a systemsale, from hardware to networks to applications packages.andP;  Unix is attractiveas an integration platform because it offers good raw performance for themoney, and because lots of products run on and with it.andP;  Yet, until recently,Nixdorf's Unix office platforms didn't lend themselves to easy customizationand integration with a variety of applications packages.andP;  Also, as an OEM ofUnix office software, Nixdorf didn't control the development of its officeplatform.andP;  With Targon Office 2.0, Nixdorf struck out on its own as aprovider of Unix office software that would fit its integration strategy.andM;Enter NCOA.andP;  The Nixdorf Computer Office Architecture defines a modular setof distributed software services--mail, print, file, calendar, database,etc.--that can accommodate third-party applications while supportingworkgroup computing and task automation.andP;  Services common to word processing,spreadsheets, graphics, and other applications are structured as a horizontallayer of software supporting these applications.andP;  Through OCS (OfficeCommunication Software) NCOA will accommodate a mix of DOS, OS/2, and Unixsystems on TCP/IP and OS/2 LAN Manager for Unix (LM/X) networks.andP;  OCS alsosupports OSI protocols and, in the future, will support SNA as a transportsystemandM;Central to NCOA and Nixdorf's office strategy is the recognition that PCs andexisting PC applications are an integral part of a viable overall solution.andO;This directly implies an architecture open to PC integration.andP;  Nixdorf iscommitted to the Unix PC as a strategic workstation, as well.andM;As an engine of applications integration, NCOA is supported by two otherNixdorf Unix platforms: DCPA and the Entry Management System (EMS).andP;  DCPA isNixdorf's data-entry system.andP;  It has been moved to Unix and extended tosupport new data-capture methods.andP;  Fax is being added first; others willfollow.andP;  EMS is a toolkit for building image storage and retrieval systemsindependent of applications and hardware architectures.andM;NCOA DefinedandM;NCOA is an architecture, not a product.andP;  It will guide the development ofTargon Office.andP;  Some of the components of Targon Office 2.0, which was justannounced as Nixdorf's first worldwide office software platform, conform toNCOA, even though the product runs on a host processor accessed by terminals.andO;These components include three modular services based on client/serverarchitecture--Targon Admin, Targon Mail, and Targon File--and threeapplications--such as Targon Word, Targon Calc, and the Desktopuser-interface front end.andP;  These will be carried forward into a distributedversion of Targon Office (Release 3.0), based on a client-serverarchitecture.andP;  The three services will become true services running onservers; the applications will become client applications.andP;  Targon Office 3.0is scheduled for worldwide release early in 1991.andP;  As NCOA evolves as anarchitecture during the next three-to-five years, Nixdorf products will fullyrealize its advantage.andP;  In early-1990, Nixdorf will offer customers PCintegration with Targon Office 2.0 as an interim step in the migration toTargon Office 3.0.andM;NCOA CLIENTS.andP;  The clients supported in NCOA are: MS-DOS with MS Windows,OS/2 with Presentation Manager, and Unix with OSF Motif.andP;  The serverssupported are Unix and OS/2.andP;  Each of these clients will feature a uniformobject model of the applications environment called the Desktop.andP;  Thisinterface will use icons to represent printers, the file system, and othershared tools, as well as personal resources.andP;  Nixdorf will build this objectmodel on top of the user-interface intrinsics of the separate environment.andO;The analogy is to Hewlett-Packard's NewWave environment.andP;  In the same waythat HP built NewWave atop MS Windows, Nixdorf will build the Desktop on topof MS Windows, OS/2 Presentation Manager, and Motif.andM;Nixdorf plans to implement its DOS/MS Windows client first, then Unix/Motif,and, finally, OS/2 Presentation Manager.andM;Where's the Macintosh?andP;  Currently, it's not on the agenda.andP;  Nixdorf'sdevelopment plans are a reflection of European users's priorities--and theMac isn't one of them.andP;  This may be the case today, but it is not likely toremain so.andP;  Indeed, Nixdorf could differentiate its office product byproviding support for the Macintosh.andP;  Support for Macintosh clients is on theback burners of many development shops.andP;  The vendor who moves it forwardstands a good chance of standing out in the crowd.andM;NCOA SERVERS.andP;  NCOA anticipates mail, file, print, time/date, event, officeprocedure, and organizational resource services initially, with others tofollow.andP;  Mail, file, print, and time/date are fairly conmon services.andO;Nixdorf's value-added is in the event, office procedure, and organizationalresource areas.andM;The Event Service registers all elements on an NCOA network.andP;  It thencoordinates both the interaction between services and between clientapplications and services.andP;  Event Service is the manager of events (messages,requests, responses, notifications) on the system.andP;  Client applicationsrequest services or respond to requests from servers through the EventService, which ensures that the right &quot;events&quot; get to the right servers inthe right order.andP;  Also, the different services can communicate with oneanother via the Event Service.andM;The Event service registers objects on the network and coordinates theirconversations across the network.andP;  Thus, the Mail Service can receivemessages from a project management application without knowing anything aboutthat application.andM;The Office Procedure Service encompasses Nixdorf's Office Procedure Language(OPL).andP;  OPL is a language to automate tasks and encode procedures into andacross applications.andP;  For example, a hospital could use OPL to ensure thatadmissions personnel follow the proper procedures when admitting patients.andO;OPL anticipates that different applications will be used in automating tasks.andO;In this, it in part provides the same macro-like function as HP NewWave'sAgent facility and the Builder component of Digital's DECdecision.andP;  Nixdorfplans to implement OPL to be independent of individual interprocesscommunications facilities, for example, on top of OS/2's Dynamic DataExchange API.andM;The Organizational Resource Service performs several functions.andP;  It is thelocus of security and authentication services, and it also functions as amessage router.andP;  It will conform to the X.500 directory standard.andM;NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE.andP;  NCOA defines servers as being based on either Unixor OS/2 and using either TCP/IP or LM/X networking software.andP;  Support forUnix servers will be implemented first, with OS/2 to follow.andP;  The gluebetween clients and servers is found in NCOA's application and serviceprogramming interfaces.andP;  These interfaces give independent developers themeans to add new applications and services to the NCOA framework.andO;Applications written to the API of NCOA will be able to participate in theenvironment with other applications and services.andM;Nixdorf plans to write its own API, but the company is committed to migratingto standards when they become available.andP;  This is more than an idle promise.andO;Nixdorf recently joined the Object Management Group (OMG), an internationalconsortium of vendors and users seeking to define a technology base for amultivendor, distributed object environment.andP;  One of the top priorities ofthe OMG is defining standard APIs.andP;  By joining OMG, Nixdorf will participatein this work, and will have early access to whatever standards emerge.andM;Notably absent from Nixdorf's server line-up is Novell's NetWare.andP;  Nixdorfdevelopers say LAN Manager made it into their plans as an extension of theirwork with OS/2.andP;  They're looking hard at NetWare, they add.andP;  That's good,given the number of NetWare networks installed.andM;Applications Focus: ODA EditorandM;Nixdorf anticipates hosting a variety of document editors within NCOA, but itis also building a new compound document editor based on the Office DocumentArchitecture (ODA), with its Office Document Interchange Format (ODIF).andP;  TheODA Editor is an architected compound document editor that uses ODA as anintegrating mechanism.andM;Nixdorf chose to focus on building a new editor because the editing functionlies at the heart of NCOA.andP;  Nixdorf sees its ODA Editor as a special serviceas opposed to a vertical slice of applications code.andP;  The Editor itself isimplemented atop an ODA engine.andP;  (See Illustration 2.)andP;  The engine is an NCOAservice, although it typically runs on clients as opposed to servers.andO;Nixdorf will provide an API to its engine, giving third parties an entreeinto using it as a base for applications that use ODA to exchange processabledocuments with other applications.andP;  Nixdorf is initially focusing on acompound document editor built atop the engine; it may leave development ofother, specialized applications to third parties--at least for the near term.andM;The company chose ODA because it is the de jure standard in compound documentinterchange.andP;  Nixdorf's strategy demanded a compound document editor built onavailable standards.andP;  Nixdorf is leveraging its Piloting of ODA (PODA) workin building the ODA Editor.andP;  It is also actively seeking partners.andP;  Nixdorfis building the engine and compound document editor.andP;  Its goal is to findother vendors to collaborate on the engine and, especially, applications thatuse the engine.andM;A PEEK AT AN ODA EDITOR.andP;  The object-oriented approach Nixdorf has adopted inNCOA is well-matched to ODA.andP;  ODA thinks of documents as collections ofelements, known as objects.andP;  Each object is defined by properties, whichdescribe its type and structure.andP;  Through its properties, each object isself-defined and independent of other objects.andP;  Users themselves set andmodify the properties of objects.andP;  For example, a paragraph is the typedescribed as text, and has properties like line length, word spacing, typefont, and size that define its appearance.andP;  Similar kinds of definitionsapply to graphics and images.andM;What's important about this underlying structure is its flexibility.andO;Elements &quot;know&quot; about their content and structure, and this knowledge isretained when the element is incorporated with other elements into adocument.andP;  Thus, a graphic can be edited in its place within a sales report.andO;In the early prototype of ODA Editor we saw, this capability allowedmultilingual editing: We edited a document comprising parallel columns ofEnglish, German, and Japanese text with a single text editor.andM;ODA also allows users to view documents from different contexts.andP;  A full viewyields a WYSIWYG display of the document, page by page.andP;  A table of contentsview is a list of the logical objects in the document, in order.andM;BETTER LATE?andP;  The biggest risk in Nixdorf's ODA Editor project is theunsettled state of ODA implementations.andP;  There's a high risk that differentvendors will implement ODA-based products that don't work well together ordon't work together at all.andP;  ODA itself is incomplete as a specification forhigh-end (i.e., multimedia) applications.andP;  Vendors must add proprietaryextensions to the basic standard to build such products.andP;  Nixdorf concedesthat there is no general industry agreement yet on its model of ODAapplications driven by an ODA engine.andP;  The PODA group may accept the model.andO;But Philips (which just announced its Papyrus editor based on an ODA subset),Apple, Digital, and Xerox aren't members of PODA.andM;Nixdorf is monitoring developments like Philips's announcement, and isseeking through PODA and the International Standards Organization toinfluence ODA's evolution to encompass new extensions.andP;  For example, ODAtoday defines content types for text, geometric graphics, and raster images.andO;Support for color is a draft international standard.andP;  Audio and video arenext on the list, but a vendor that wants to implement support for thesetoday goes it alone.andM;This is one case where a delay in coming to market may benefit a vendor.andO;Nixdorf plans to roll out its ODA Editor in about two years.andP;  In themeantime, Nixdorf's developers will have the benefit of monitoring subsequentdevelopments in ODA.andM;Nixdorf's Involvement in StandardsandM;Nixdorf has committed NCOA to conformance with international standards, dejure and otherwise.andP;  In doing so, the company has set itself up for yetanother cultural change.andP;  Nixdorf's product line today features manyproprietary products and protocols.andP;  DPTG, its terminal and file-transferprotocol, is an example.andP;  To implement its vision, Nixdorf needs to movebeyond its heritage of proprietary plumbing--and quickly.andM;Nixdorf appears to be serious about its commitment to standards.andP;  It was afounding member of the Open Software Foundation and it has joined the ObjectManagement Group (OMG), which has begun examining standards in this area, toensure that NCOA is aligned with developing standards.andP;  It is also an activeparticipant in the European Economic Community's (EEC's) Esprit technologyprojects.andP;  Esprit projects are funded by the EEC to promote a robust Europeantechnology base.andM;Nixdorf is active in two Esprit projects.andP;  The first is the PODA projectwhich grew out of the work by the European Computer Manufacturers Association(ECMA) on generating the ODA standard.andP;  PODA I has defined an architecturefor ODA-based document editing.andP;  PODA II is examining application integrationwithin the ODA framework.andP;  PODA's leaders are Nixdorf, ICL, Bull, Siemens,Oce (Netherlands), Olivetti, British Telecom, TITN (France), UniversityCollege London, and IBM.andP;  The second big Esprit project for Nixdorf is Ithaca(Integrated Toolkit for Highly Advanced Computer Applications).andP;  Ithaca is anobject-oriented development environment featuring a language, tools, and anintegrated objectbase (an object-oriented database).andP;  Ithaca's leaders areNixdorf, Bull, Datamont SpA (Italy), the University of Geneva, TAO (Spain),Cap Sesa Innovation (France), and the Foundation of Research and Technology(Greece).andM;Targon Office 2.0andM;As noted earlier, Nixdorf has begun planting the seeds of a distributedoffice environment with Targon Office 2.0, a suite of office software.andP;  Itsbasic components include a word processor (Targon Word), a filing system(Targon File), system administration (Targon Admin), and a Desktop tying thesystem together.andP;  This includes Prototype and standard paragraph management,along with the Document Procedure Language.andP;  DPL (Document ProcedureLanguage) manages text manipulation between objects.andP;  Optionally, it includesa spreadsheet (Targon Calc), native X.400 mail (Targon Mail), Teletex, forms,notepad, calendar, and phonebook.andP;  DDB/4 and 3270 integration can be added.andM;Targon Word is Nixdorf's enhanced version of the text editor in Quadratron'sQliq.andP;  The forms, notepad, phonebook, and calendar portions are licensed fromQuadratron.andP;  Targon Calc is Nixdorf's enhanced version of Q-Calc from QualitySoftware.andM;Nixdorf has been marketing Targon Office 2.0 in Europe for more than a year.andO;Last month, the company announced an English version of Targon Office 2.0,and said it intends to provide Portuguese, Dutch, and Finnish translationsduring the first quarter of 1990, and French and Swedish translations duringthe second quarter.andP;  In the United States, this means Nixdorf can focus itsmarketing on Targon Office, and start to eliminate the diffusion thatresulted from Nixdorf Computer Corporation, its U.S.andP;  subsidiary, sellingUniplex while the European operation sold a different platform.andP;  The firstorder of business for Nixdorf is to convince Nixdorf Computer Corporation, toadopt and market Targon Office 2.0.andP;  At press time, the discussions betweenparent and subsidiary had just begun.andM;Targon Office 2.0 is based on a shared-logic architecture accessed bycharacter-based terminals.andP;  Nixdorf offers it only as a package on Targonhardware.andP;  Targon Office 2.0 is offered in two packages and a set of options.andO;The Text Management package includes the Desktop, Targon Word, Targon File,and Targon Admin.andP;  The Office Management package adds to these forms,calendar, notepad, and phonebook.andP;  The options are Targon Calc, a module thatgives users access to Nixdorf's DDB/4 relational DBMS, 3270 emulation andfile transfer, Targon Mail, and Teletex.andM;Targon Office 2.0 is comparable in its range of functions to Qliq and UniplexII Plus.andP;  Its system administration module and task automation facilities arebetter; its integration of PCs and workstations is less elegant, and itdoesn't include compound document editing.andP;  Here's a rundown of Targon Office2.0's distinguishing features.andM;THE DESKTOP.andP;  Targon Office 2.0 introduces NCOA's concept of objects via theDesktop, a character-based windowing interface and a Dialog Manageruser-interface component that runs across Targon Office applications.andP;  Thesystem associates documents and files with the applications that createdthem, simplifying their invocation and manipulation.andP;  Objects can be filedand mailed.andP;  Working with physical resources on the system is alsosimplified: Printing takes one keystroke, and Targon Admin reducesconfiguration changes to the manipulation of objects representing devices,applications, and users.andM;The Desktop uses icons and dynamic soft keys to structure user access tosystem resources and applications.andP;  Targon Office 2.0 doesn't supportgraphical displays, so the icons are boxes, not pretty pictures that can bedragged across the screen.andP;  Users perform functions on objects using softkeys.andP;  To send a document via mail, for example, a user positions the cursorover the object and presses the Send soft key.andM;The Desktop gives the user personal space on a time-shared system.andP;  The mainscreen is the user's primary working environment.andP;  The work area on the leftis the place to create new objects and edit existing ones.andP;  Targon Office 2.0supports seven types of objects, including documents and spreadsheets (see&quot;Objects&quot; below).andP;  Users create new objects by selecting the &quot;create&quot; optionfrom a menu and then selecting a type of object.andP;  The system invokes theproper application needed to create the object.andP;  For example, creating aspreadsheet object invokes Targon Calc, the package's spreadsheet.andM;On the right of the main screen are the user's principal resources.andP;  Cabinetsgive the user access to Targon File, Nixdorf's own distributed ISAM-basedfiling system, and to both their own and shared objects/files contained in ahierarchical structure up to 10 levels deep.andP;  The Inbox and Outbox icons arethe user's access to Targon Mail.andP;  The Waste Basket is a temporary repositoryfor up to 30 deleted objects.andP;  Printers give users access to print queues andother management functions.andP;  Users don't print from here; printing isaccomplished using a soft key.andP;  Users running PCs in terminal emulation modewith Targon Office 2.0 can have a sixth icon on their Desktop that exits themto DOS.andM;An Extensions icon is the user's doorway into other parts of the system thataren't represented on the desktop.andP;  These include the forms application, thesystem's calendar, notepad, phonebook, access to DDB/4, access to 3270emulation and file transfer, and system administration services.andM;The Dialog Manager is the key to achieving the PC-like feel of Targon Office2.0.andP;  The Dialog Manager is slipped between the Desktop front end and systemresources and services.andP;  It is a layer of software that presents files,applications, and other resources, and mail, print, and other services as aseries of personal and shared objects.andP;  The Dialog Manager simulates aclient-server architecture within a shared-logic system.andM;OBJECTS.andP;  Targon Office 2.0 classifies its objects into three categories:resource objects, containers, and application objects.andP;  Resource objectsinclude the filing system, mail, 3270 emulation, DDB/4 integration, calendar,and task-automation routines.andP;  Folders are containers that hold multipleobjects.andP;  Application objects are documents, spreadsheets, and files createdwith specific applications.andP;  The user's file is associated with theapplication that created it.andP;  For example, in selecting a document from alisting on the Desktop, the user invokes Targon Word on the appropriate file.andM;Targon Office 2.0 allows users to work with 10 types of objects.andM;* Document.andP;  A document is formatted text created using Targon Word.andP;  (Usersof Quadratron's Qliq Editor can edit these documents and vice versa.)andM;* Text.andP;  A text object is an unformatted document created using Targon Word.andO;One purpose of text objects is to export text to other text-processingformats.andM;* Dictionary.andP;  Dictionaries are custom spell-checking files that are createdusing Targon Word.andM;* Glossary.andP;  A Glossary contains keystroke-saving macros.andP;  The macros arecreated using a keystroke recorder and Targon Word.andM;* Folder.andP;  Folders are created using Targon File.andM;* Distribution List.andP;  A Distribution List is created using Targon Mail.andM;* Spreadsheet.andP;  A spreadsheet is created using Targon Calc.andM;* Mail Journal.andP;  A Mail Journal is a monthly, weekly, or daily summary ofE-mail messages; it is created by Targon Mail.andM;* Program.andP;  Program objects are scripts or programs that can be executed fromthe Unix shell.andM;* External.andP;  External Objects allow users to file or mail programs or filesthat have not been formally integrated into Targon Office 2.0.andP;  For example,Lotus 1-2-3 hasn't been added to Targon Office 2.0, but a user canencapsulate a Lotus 1-2-3 file as an External Object and mail it to a useracross the country.andP;  The user on the other end can then manipulate the filewith lotus 1-2-3 or import the file into Targon Calc, and file it in TargonFile.andP;  External Objects can also encompass executable programs.andP;  Lotus 1-2-3,then, could itself become an External Object.andM;Upon creation, each object is registered with a reference to the applicationthat created it in two Unix files, one for content and one for a Profile ofthe object.andP;  Separating content from Profile information helps users locateindividual objects and objects that are similar.andP;  Profiles can be indexedusing keywords.andP;  An object's profile can contain a number of things--the nameof the object's creator, the name of the file cabinet the object is storedin, the access permissions, the delete date, the name of subsequent users whomodify the object, distribution list information, the name of the object, andits type.andP;  Users can search the cabinets in Targon File for objects by typeand creator name, for example.andM;Profiles are automatically updated to reflect the object's current status.andO;When a user mails an object, for example, the object's Profile is updated toreflect who mailed what to whom.andP;  Thus, an object's profile becomes itschronicle.andM;Readers familiar with object environments like Hewlett-Packard's NewWave andNeXT's NextStep will recognize these concepts.andP;  One note of caution: TargonOffice 2.0's objects are not objects as defined by object-orientedprogramming.andP;  Targon Office 2.0 does not place objects into class structuresthat define how functions and features can be inherited by one object fromanother.andP;  The only use of inheritance is in Targon File.andP;  A keyword definedat a high level of the file hierarchy will operate at lower levels proceedingfrom it.andM;INTEGRATION FROM WITHIN TARGON WORD.andP;  Targon Word can be used to integratedata from a variety of sources into a single document--but without a WYSIWYGdisplay for graphics and images.andP;  By selecting parameters off a menu, userscan create &quot;graphics space reservations&quot; for images and graphics, andreference the file they want included in the space at print time.andP;  The properfile is bound into the document when it is printed.andP;  The result is primitivecompound documents.andP;  There are no live links in this scheme.andM;Data stored in DDB/4, Nixdorf's SQL relational DBMS, can also be pulled intodocuments.andP;  From within a document, a user selects an &quot;Access to DDB/4&quot;option from a menu, which switches the user to a query interface calledXEasy.andP;  From XEasy, users can formulate queries and select up to 64 records.andO;Exiting from XEasy, the user is returned to the document, and can then marklocations for deposit of DDB/4 data and key in the individual entries one byone with a single keystroke.andM;Nixdorf provides the DDB/4 access facility mainly for ad hoc queries.andP;  Thecompany anticipates that most DDB/4 search procedures will be encoded in DPLroutines.andP;  Nixdorf does not provide connections to other SQL databases in thefirst release of Targon Office 2.0.andP;  Support for Oracle and Ingres areplanned for early 1990, with other databases to follow in subsequent releasesof the product.andM;Users can also use the 3279 Data Integration application within Targon Officeto integrate data from an IBM host into a document.andP;  By extricating data froma 3270 data stream, this application makes the host available within a TargonWord edit session.andP;  The entire process can be automated using a built-inmacro facility.andP;  Background or batch processing can also be achieved byincluding the macro in a DPL routine.andM;In addition, Nixdorf announced DISOSS integration within Targon Office 2.0(for release early 1990), where Targon Mail and Targon File interact via DDSand DLS of DISOSS.andM;Generally, document conversion is provided between Targon Word and manyindustry-standard formats using the keypak conversion package from KeywordOffice Technology.andP;  This facilitates document exchange between as many as 40word processing packages, including WordPerfect, Microsoft Word, and DCA.andM;EXTENSIONS.andP;  The Extensions option on the main Desktop screen is the user'sportal into the system beyond his or her personal desktop.andP;  Users of theTargon Office Text Management package are presented with menu optionsincluding systems administration, and access to a filing index facility.andO;Users of the Office Management package add to these facilities the formsapplication, calendar, phonebook, and notepad.andP;  In addition, DDB/4 access and3270 emulation are separate features.andM;Targon Admin shields users from the underlying Unix system.andP;  Through menusand soft keys, Targon Admin allows an administrator to maintain userpermissions, add new users, and add and delete applications.andP;  The interfaceis consistent with the rest of the system.andP;  Individual users work with asubset of Targon Admin to customize their environments.andM;Extensions' DDB/4 option gives the user direct access to DDB/4.andP;  When thisicon is chosen, the user is placed into a DDB/4 session.andM;DOCUMENT PROCEDURE LANGUAGE.andP;  Having organized Targon Office 2.0 into aseries of objects, Document Procedure Language (DPL) allows organizations toautomate interactions and exchanges betweenthem.andP;  DPL is a BAsic-likelanguage with embedded SQL used to customize document-oriented applications.andO;It lays the groundwork for OPL.andM;DPL is designed to aid Nixdorf's integration effort, and to help customersMIS departments further customize Targon Office 2.0 environments.andP;  Nixdorf'sapproach to the problem of task automation is different from the approachtaken by Hewlett-Packard with its NewWave product.andP;  NewWave uses keystrokerecording to automate routine taks.andP;  Nixdorf views keystroke recording as auseful way to improve personal productivity, and provides this facility withTargon Word glossaries.andP;  However, Nixdorf believes the NewWave approach is aweak base for automating tasks and procedures.andP;  DPL forces organizations todesign, program, verify, and debug the tasks they automate.andM;Nixdorf used DPL to write the Mail Merge function in Targon Office 2.0.andP;  MailMerge is one of several DPL routines delivered with Targon Office 2.0.andM;MIGRATION VEHICLE.andP;  As a transition environment, Targon Office 2.0 iseffective.andP;  It introduces the concepts guiding development of Nixdorf'sfuture environment without requiring wholesale replacement of terminals withworkstations.andP;  And investments in Targon Office 2.0 won't be blown away asNixdorf implements office software based on a distributed architecture.andP;  Asnoted, key components of Targon Office 2.0 will be migrated to Nixdorf'sdistributed version of the environment.andP;  Even Targon Word will have a longfuture, Nixdorf believes.andP;  ODA Editors won't totally displace it for years tocome.andM;A key step in the migration process is the introduction of PCs to theenvironment before early 1990.andP;  Targon Office 2.0 PC Integration will fillthe most glaring deficiency of Targon Office 2.0.andP;  The PC integrationenhancement will allow PCs to be configured as Targon Office terminals underthe Desktop interface.andP;  Also, Nixdorf will provide a DOS version of TargonWord for these PCs.andM;It works like this: When users boot their PCs, a terminal emulation sessionis launched and the Desktop interface comes up on the PC display.andP;  At thispoint, the PC user has all of the capabilities available to terminal users.andO;When the user selects a document for editing or creates a document, the hostsystem suspends the terminal emulation session, transfers the file from itsfile system to the PC, and invokes Targon Word under DOS on that file.andP;  Thefile transfer is accomplished using Nixdorf's DPTG protocol.andP;  Targon Office2.0 manages the transition from terminal emulation to Targon Word for DOS.andO;Manual file transfer is also possible between the server and the PCs.andM;The DOS integration package is helpful to Nixdorf customers who want to usetheir PCs intelligently within the Targon Office 2.0 environment to offloadthe main processor in a shared-logic environment.andP;  In addition, an identicaluser interface is presented to the PC and dumb terminal user.andP;  But the realbenefits come with Targon Office 3.0's distributed function and accommodationof a variety of desktops.andM;ConclusionandM;It's easy to pick on Targon Office 2.0's list of features by calling theminadequate or even boring, given the movement today toward graphical userinterfaces, compound document editing, and distributed network computing.andO;But to do so misses the product's significance.andP;  Nixdorf may not competedirectly with Unix office software vendors like Applix, Uniplex, orQuadratron in selling Targon Office 2.0 today, but future plans includemaking Targon Office 2.0 available on other hardware platforms.andP;  The productinitially will only be sold on Nixdorf's Targon hardware, and then primarilyas part of a total solution sale.andP;  Nixdorf's added value is in integratingall of the pieces of whole solutions, as well as providing a facility for thegeneration of specific customer-oriented applications (e.g., using OPL toautomate office procedures).andM;Targon Office 2.0 is important for the change it represents in Nixdorf.andP;  AndNixdorf is important for the potential it brings to the Unix market.andM;First, consider Nixdorf.andP;  The company is finally in a position to execute astrategy it understands within the context of Unix and standards-basedcomputing.andP;  And the NCOA gives it a plan to introduce advanced technologieswithin a comprehensive framework.andP;  These are both firsts for the company.andM;Second, consider the Unix market.andP;  Is Nixdorf's strategy useful to anycustomers?andP;  We believe it is.andP;  Given the hyperdiversity of the Unix market,we believe a fair amount of customers will gladly pay Nixdorf to solve theirinformation management problems and build their solutions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
