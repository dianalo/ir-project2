GIVEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As Texaco Inc. prepares to emerge frombankruptcy court protection next month, a welcoming party oftakeover specialists continues to grow outside the oil giant's door.   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which has carried out some of thelargest leveraged buyouts in U.S. history, said Tuesday it isseeking federal permission to buy up to 15 percent of Texaco Inc.'sstock.   The investment banking firm, often a management ally in itsdeals, said it had already acquired 11.95 million Texaco shares, orabout 4.9 percent of Texaco's roughly 242 million outstandingshares.   In filing to enlarge that stake, Kohlberg Kravis would joinfinanciers Carl C. Icahn and T. Boone Pickens in announcinginterest or taking substantial stakes in the nation's third-largestoil company.   Getty Petroleum Co., a product of Texaco's ill-fated 1984acquisition of Getty Oil Co., has also filed for the same federalpermission to up its stake in Texaco.   Industry analysts viewed the latest development as anotherindication of the stiff challenge that Texaco's management willface as it attempts to hang on to control over the company whileconducting an orderly reorganization beginning next month.   ``Big shark, little shark, they all bite,'' observed Frank P.Knuettel, who tracks oil companies at Prudential Bache Securities.   For its part, Texaco took the high road in its response.   ``Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has in past situations demonstrated anability to be a constructive shareholder, which recognizes theimportance of building value for the long term. We have noindication that their intentions with Texaco are any different,''the company said in a statement from its White Plains, N.Y.,headquarters.   ``We are hopeful that (it) will play a constructive role asTexaco pursues prompt and aggressives steps to restructure thecompany and maximize total value and return for all ourshareholders.''   Investors responded enthusiastically to Kohlberg Kravis'sannouncement. In nationwide trading of New York StockExchange-listed issues, Texaco jumped $3.25 a share to $48.   Kohlberg Kravis said it had purchased its shares ``some monthsago in the open market.'' Ruth Pachman, of the public relationsfirm Kekst and Co., which was representing the firm, said therewould be no further comment.   But a source close to the investment company said the filingwould permit it to ``initiate discussions'' with Texaco'smanagement. The source would not elaborate.   Kohlberg Kravis is a leader in leveraged buyouts, in whichinvestors pay off the debt from a corporate takeover with the cashflow of the target company or by selling some or all of its assets.   Its $6.1 billion buyout of Beatrice Cos., completed in April1986, was the largest leveraged buyout ever carried out in thiscountry. Seven months later, the firm bought Safeway Stores forabout $4.2 billion.   Texaco last week received U.S. Bankruptcy Court permission toemerge from Chapter 11 protection from its creditors with afinancial reorganization plan that will become official on April 7.   As part of that plan it has said it will sell at least $3billion in assets.   But analysts, who estimate the company to be worth between $50and $60 per share, if it were broken up and sold off in pieces,have been expecting some outside move to accelerate those sales toraise the shares' value.   Icahn _ Texaco's largest shareholder with 14.8 percent of itsshares _ has been aggressively critical of Texaco's management andhas been widely expected to lead the charge on the company.   On Tuesday, he said he was ``surprised but also pleased'' tolearn of the Kohlberg Kravis move.   Icahn has promised to field a slate of five candidates _including himself _ for five board seats up for election at thecompany's annual meeting this spring, if Texaco does not put itselfup for sale. Texaco officials have vowed repeatedly not to do that.   Pickens has received federal regulatory permission to buy up to15 percent of Texaco's shares. He has said he would support theIcahn slate. On Tuesday, however, David Bachelder, president ofPickens' Mesa Limited Partnership would not say how many Texacoshares Pickens has actually accumulated.   Getty Petroleum Co., an independent marketer of petroleumproducts, has made a similar filing, claiming, however, that it is``for investment only.''   Philip L. Dodge, an analyst at Nomura Securities InternationalInc., said that ``the remaining question is whether the Texacomanagement remains in charge of the company.''   Alluding to the growing pressure on Texaco, he suggested that``provisions could be made'' for its management to participate in aleveraged buyout.   ``I don't think they'd do it with much appetite, but (theywould) if they saw it as the lesser of two evils,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
