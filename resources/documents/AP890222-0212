The Conservative Democratic Party, which has the largestopposition representation in the National Assembly with 14 deputies,also asked for absentee balloting for Nicaraguans abroad, many ofwhom live in Miami.   In a communique issued after party officials met with Ortega, theConservative Democrats said, ``Although re-election is notforbidden, it would be convenient for the peaceful coexistence inthe nation that (Ortega) not present his candidacy for re-election.''   Ortega has hinted he will run again and seems the likeliestchoice, although the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front hasnot announced an official candidate.   In spurning early elections, the Conservative Democrats echoedthe view of other parties that they don't have enough time toorganize effectively for elections in February 1990.   The party also demanded that no state property or employee beused for political propaganda; that the military be denied the vote;and that the number of regional vote-counting centers be cut inhalf, apparently to allow all parties to have observers at all suchcenters.   A faction of the Liberal party met with Ortega on Wednesday.   This Central American country of about 3 million people has 15legal political parties. Seven of them are represented in theNational Assembly.   The 14 opposition parties met Tuesday night to discuss Ortega'soffer of renewing talks on reforming electoral laws.   ``Most of us decided not to go, but we left the option open forwhoever wants to attend independently,'' Alan Zambrana of theCommunist Party said Wednesday. His party declined Ortega'sinvitation.   Ortega has said negotiations would center on the agreement he andthe presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemalasigned on Feb. 14 in El Salvador.   It calls for Nicaragua to institute democratic reforms, such asgiving equal air time to the opposition; including oppositionrepresentatives in the Supreme Electoral Council, and allowinginternational observers to oversee general elections, which Ortegamoved up by 10 months, to Feb. 25, 1990.   ``Any dialogue must be with the entire civic opposition,''Zambrana, a deputy in the assembly, said. ``We're not going to lendourselves to the Sandinistas' game of trying to divide us byinviting us to bilateral talks.''   It does not appear that the Sandinistas would have to make muchof an effort to divide the opposition. Already existing are threeLiberal parties; four Social-Christian parties and threeConservative parties.   The Communist Party and the Marxist-Leninist Popular ActionMovement split the far left. Each has two deputies in the assembly.   Mauricio Diaz, president of the left-of-center Social-ChristianPopular Party, initially said his party would talk with Ortega, thensaid a decision had not been made. His party has the second-largestopposition representation in the legislature, with six deputies.   Eric Ramirez's Social-Christian Party is sending two delegates tomeet with Ortega, a party official said.</TEXT></DOC>
