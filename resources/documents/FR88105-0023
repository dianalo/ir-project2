Proposed amendmentsto this rule were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>August 27, 1987 (at 52 FR 32478 <T3>et seq.</T3>).Interested persons were invited to submit comments on the proposed rule.Members of the public may submit comments concerning the present rule bywriting the previously cited address. These comments will be consideredbut will receive no response in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>In addition to the previously published proposed amendments, other changesare being made to the final rule. These changes are meant to clarify thescope or intent of the existing rule, or reflect management decisions.Based on the nature of the amendments, the Bureau finds good cause underthe Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) to include these amendmentswithin the final rule without a notice of proposed rulemaking, and an opportunityfor public comment. Similarly, because these amendments do not change thegeneral intent or substance of the existing rule, and because no publiccomment was received on the proposed amendments, the Bureau of Prisonsfinds good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) to publish these amendments withouta delay in the effective date. In recognition of these revisions, and forease of reading, the Bureau is republishing its entire rule on Inmate Discipline.The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a major rulefor the purpose of EO 12291. The Bureau of Prisons had determined thatEO 12291 does not apply to this rule since the rule involves agency management.After review of the law and regulations, the Director, Bureau of Prisons,has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (Pub. L. 96-354), does not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Changes</ITAG>1. <T3>Section 541.2_</T3>In andSection; 541.2(a), the word ``directly'' isdeleted, as the investigating officer ordinarily should not be involvedin the incident. From andSection; 541.2(b), the sentence, ``In institutionswith unit management, these staff members will ordinarily be members ofthe Unit Team'', is deleted. The Bureau's implementing instructions tostaff states that in institutions with unit management, the authority tohold initial hearings and impose minor sanctions is ordinarily delegatedto the staff members of the inmate's unit. Where the institution does nothave unit management, the Warden shall delegate those responsibilitiesto one or more institution staff. Paragraph (c) is reworded, but its intentis unchanged.2. <T3>Section 541.11</T3>_In andSection; 541.11, Table 1, Item 6, the phrase``The appropriate reviewing official'' is added for clarity. Also in thissection, in Table 2, the note section is revised to read that staff maysuspend disciplinary proceedings for a period not to exceed two calendarweeks while informal resolution is ``undertaken and accomplished''. Thischange is made because the Bureau believes that in those situations whereinformal resolution is a viable alternative, it should be accomplishedby the end of the two week period, not merely attempted.3. <T3>Section 541.13</T3>_In Table 3, and in andSection; 541.13(a)(1), ``ItemG, Loss of privileges'' is added to the list of sanctions the DHO may,in addition to the execution of one or more of Sanctions A through E, imposeor suspend for prohibited acts in the greatest severity category. Whilesanction ``G'' is new to the greatest severity category, it is not a newsanction in the inmate discipline process. Its use is deemed to be a goodtool in certain disciplinary situations, even for high risk offenses. Section541.13(a)(2), (3), and (4) is reworded, although the intent is unchanged,to clearly define the specific sanctions which may be imposed, executed,or suspended by the Discipline Hearing Officer or the Unit Discipline Committee.In andSection; 541.13_Table 3, Code 208, the phrase ``or destroying, altering,interfering with, improperly using, or damaging any security device, mechanism,or procedure'' is added to clarify the scope of the existing language,``tampering with or blocking any lock device''. In Code 224, the citedexample, ``pushing an officer'', is deleted because the Bureau believesthat the DHO will be able in the fact-finding process to determine theseriousness of an assault. Also in Table 3, immediately below Code 499,the statement, ``<T3>Aiding </T3>another person to commit any of these offenses, <T3>attempting </T3>to commit any of these offenses, <T3>and making plans </T3>to commit any of these offenses, in all categoriesof severity, shall be considered the same as a commission of the offenseitself'' is added to reiterate the language and scope of andSection; 541.13(b).Table 4, ``Sanctions of the Discipline Hearing Officer'', is revised todelete the reference to the ``receiving'' Regional Director where a presentor impending emergency situation requires the immediate transfer of aninmate prior to either a UDC or DHO hearing. The word ``receiving'' isdeleted because a transfer from one region to another will require theapproval of both the sending and receiving Regional Directors.Although not included in the final rule, two of the existing sanctions,pertaining to good time, are greatly restricted for inmates convicted foroffenses committed on or after November 1, 1987, the effective date ofthe Comprehensive Crime Control Act. These inmates are only eligible toreceive 54 days of ``good conduct time credit'' (18 U.S.C. 3624(b)). Becausethis credit is only given at the end of each year of time served and, oncegiven, is vested, the Bureau's internal staff implementing instructionsadvise the DHO that the DHO's authority is limited to <T3>recommending</T3> to the Warden or designee that the inmate be deniedall or part of the maximum of 54 days good conduct time credit for thatyear. In Table 5, ``Sanctions for Repetition of Prohibited Acts Within the SameCategory'', the phrase ``additional sanctions are authorized accordingto the following chart'' is clarified to read ``increased sanctions areauthorized to be imposed by the DHO according to the following chart''.The UDC is not authorized to impose those sanctions under the sole purviewof the DHO. While the wording in this section has changed, the intent remainsthe same. 4. <T3>Section 541.15</T3>_In andSection; 541.15(e), the phrase ``may drop''is added to indicate the intent of this section and andSection; 541.11. 5. <T3>Section 541.16</T3>_The title of this section is changed to read ``Establishmentand Functioning of the Discipline Hearing Officer''. 6. <T3>Section 541.17</T3>_In andSection; 541.17(f)(2), the word ``committee''is deleted because this reference is no longer appropriate when describinga decision by the Discipline Hearing Officer. Except for this change, theintent of this section remains the same. 7. <T3>Section 541.19</T3>_The wording in andSection; 541.19 is revised to state,``An inmate's initial appeal of a decision of the DHO should be filed directlyto the appropriate Regional Office''. This section also adds a sentencewhich states, ``The inmate should forward a copy of the DHO report or,if not available at the time of filing, should state in his appeal thedate of the DHO hearing and the nature of the charges against the inmate''.While this requirement is new to the rule, it is consistent with the Bureau'srequirement that inmates include appropriate documentation (to establisha date for timely filing) with their appeals. The last sentence of theintroductory paragraph to andSection; 541.19 is revised to read, ``On appeals,the appropriate reviewing authority shall consider * * *'' While the Region is the initial level of appeal for a DHO decision, theBureau's internal staff instructions allow Wardens to review DHO hearingsand appeals, as the Warden considers necessary, to assure substantial compliancewith the provisions of the discipline policy. The Bureau's internal staffinstructions also allow the DHO to receive informal complaints abut theprocedure, and the correct mistakes locally before the Regional review.8. <T3>Section 541.21</T3>_The wording in andSection; 541.21(c)(6) is revisedto delete the requirement that recommendations for withholding an inmate'sexercise periods be from the ``DHO or Captain''. This section now readsthat exercise periods, not to exceed one week, may be withheld from aninmate by order of the Warden, following a hearing, and recommendation,before a person ``certified in the discipline hearing officer procedures''.This section continues by stating that withholding of exercise periodscan only be recommended upon a finding by the ``person conducting the hearing''that the actions of the segregated inmate pose a threat to the safety orhealth conditions of the unit. After careful review of this section, theBureau has determined that it is not always feasible for the DHO or Captainto hold such a hearing. For example, a DHO assigned to conduct hearingsat more than one institution may not be at a given institution when theactions of a segregated inmate are perceived by staff to pose a threatto the safety or health conditions of the unit. In such a situation, anotherstaff member, trained and certified in discipline hearing officer procedures,would conduct the fact-finding hearing, and would be authorized to recommendthe withholding of an inmate's exercise periods, The ultimate decisionto withhold these exercise periods, however, remains with the Warden.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 541 </ITAG>Prisoners.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the rulemaking authority vested in the AttorneyGeneral in 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and delegated to the Director, Bureau of Prisonsin 28 CFR 0.96(q), Chapter V of 28 CFR is amended as follows: In SubchapterC, Part 541, Subpart A is added and Subpart B is revised.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: December 29, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.

The provisionsof this rule apply to all persons committed to the care, custody, and control(direct or constructive) of the Bureau of Prisons.(b) The following general principles apply in every disciplinary actiontaken:(1) Only institution staff may take disciplinary action.(2) Staff shall take disciplinary action at such times and to the degreenecessary to regulate an inmate's behavior within Bureau rules and institutionguidelines and to promote a safe and orderly institution environment.(3) Staff shall control inmate behavior in a completely impartial and consistentmanner.(4) Disciplinary action may not be capricious or retaliatory.(5) Staff may not impose or allow imposition of corporal punishment ofany kind.(6) If it appears at any stage of the disciplinary process that an inmateis mentally ill, staff shall refer the inmate to a mental health professionalfor determination of whether the inmate is responsible for his conductor is incompetent. Staff may take no disciplinary action against an inmatewhom mental health staff determines to be incompetent or not responsiblefor his conduct.(i) A person is not responsible for his conduct if, at the time of theconduct, the person, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect,was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness ofhis acts. When a person is determined not responsible for his conduct,the Incident Report is to show as a finding that the person did not committhe prohibited act because that person was found not to be mentally responsiblefor his conduct.(ii) A person is incompetent if that person lacks the ability to understandthe nature of the disciplinary proceedings, or to assist in his defenseat the proceedings. When a person is determined incompetent, the disciplinaryproceedings shall be postponed until such time as the inmate is able tounderstand the nature of the disciplinary proceedings and to assist inhis defense at those proceedings.

Specific sanctions are authorized for each category(see Table 4 for a discussion of each sanction). Imposition of a sanctionrequires that the inmate first is found to have committed a prohibitedact.(1) <T3>Greatest category offenses:</T3> The Discipline Hearing Officer shallimpose and execute one or more of sanctions A through E. The DHO may alsosuspend one or more additional sanctions A through G. The DHO may imposeand execute sanction F and/or G only in addition to execution of one ormore of sanctions A through E.(2) <T3>High category offenses:</T3> The Discipline Hearing Officer shall imposeand execute one or more of sanctions A through M, and may also suspendone or more additional sanctions A through M. The Unit Discipline Committeeshall impose and execute one or more of sanctions G through M and may alsosuspend one or more additional sanctions G through M.(3) <T3>Moderate category offenses:</T3> The Discipline Hearing Officer shallimpose at least one sanction A through N, but may suspend any sanctionor sanctions imposed. The Unit Discipline Committee shall impose at leastone sanction G through N, but may suspend any sanction or sanctions imposed.(4) <T3>Low moderate category offenses:</T3> The Discipline Hearing officershall impose at least on sanction E through P, but may suspend any sanctionor sanctions imposed. The Unit Discipline Committee shall impose at leastone sanction G through P, but may suspend any sanction or sanctions imposed(b) <T3>Aiding</T3> another person to commit any of these offenses, <T3>attempting</T3> to commit any of these offenses, <T3>and making plans</T3> to commit any of these offenses, in all categoriesof severity, <T3>shall be considered the same as a commission of the offense itself.</T3>In these cases, the letter ``A'' is combined with the offense code. Forexample, planning an escape would be considered as Escape and coded 102A.Likewise, attempting the adulteration of any food or drink would be coded209A.(c) Suspensions of any sanction cannot exceed six months. Revocation andexecution of a suspended sanction require that the inmate first is foundto have committed any subsequent prohibited act. Only the Discipline HearingOfficer (DHO) may execute, suspend, or revoke and execute suspension ofsanctions A through F. The Discipline Hearing Officer (DHO) or Unit DisciplineCommittee (UDC) may execute, suspend, or revoke and execute suspensionsof sanctions G through P. Revocations and execution of suspensions maybe made only at the level (DHO or UDC) which originally imposed the sanction.The DHO now has that authority for suspensions which were earlier imposedby the Inmate Discipline Committee (IDC).(d) If the Unit Discipline Committee has previously imposed a suspendedsanction and subsequently refers a case to the Discipline Hearing Officer,the referral shall include an advisement to the DHO of any intent to revokethat suspension if the DHO finds that the prohibited act was committed.If the DHO then finds that the prohibited act was committed, the DHO shallso advise the Unit Discipline Committee who may then revoke the previoussuspension.(e) The Unit Discipline Committee or Discipline Hearing Officer may imposeincreased sanctions for repeated, frequent offenses according to the guidelinespresented in Table 5.(f) Sanctions by severity of prohibited act, with eligibility for restorationof forfeited and withheld statutory good time are presented in Table 6.    <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 3_<T4>Prohibited Acts and Disciplinary Severity Scale</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[The UDC shall refer all Greatest Severity Prohibited Acts to theDHO with recommendations as to an appropriate disposition.]</ITAG><H1>Code</H1><H1>Prohibited acts</H1><H1>Sanctions</H1><ITAG tagnum="21"><T2>GREATEST CATEGORY</T2><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">100<D>Killing</D><D>A.

Disallowance of extra good time is limitedto the extra good time for the calendar month in which the violation occurs.It may not be withheld or restored. The sanction of termination or disallowanceof extra good time may not be suspended. Authority to restore forfeitedstatutory good time is delegated to the Warden.

However, when staff witnesses or has a reasonable beliefthat a violation of Bureau regulations has been committed by an inmate,and when staff considers informal resolution of the incident inappropriateor unsuccessful, staff shall prepare an Incident Report and promptly forwardit to the appropriate Lieutenant. Except for prohibited acts in the Greatestor High Severity Category, the Lieutenant may informally dispose of theIncident Report or forward the Incident Report for investigation consistentwith this section. The Lieutenant shall expunge the inmate's file of theIncident Report if informal resolution is accomplished. Only the DHO maymake a final disposition on a prohibited act in the Greatest Severity Category.(b) <T3>Investigation. </T3>Staff shall conduct the investigation promptlyunless circumstances beyond the control of the investigator intervene.(1) When it appears likely that the incident may be the subject of criminalprosecution, the investigating officer shall suspend the investigation,and staff may not question the inmate until the Federal Bureau of Investigationor other investigative agency interviews have been completed or until theagency responsible for the criminal investigation advises that staff questioningmay occur.(2) The inmate may receive a copy of the Incident Report prior to beingseen by the investigating agency. The investigating officer (Bureau ofPrisons) shall give the inmate a copy of the Incident Report at the beginningof the investigation, unless there is good cause for delivery at a laterdate, such as absence of the inmate from the institution or a medical conditionwhich argues against delivery. If the investigation is delayed for anyreason, any employee may deliver the charge(s) to the inmate. The staffmember shall note the date and time the inmate received a copy of the IncidentReport. The investigator shall also read the charge(s) to the inmate andask for the inmate's statement concerning the incident unless it appearslikely that the incident may be the subject of criminal prosecution. Theinvestigator shall advise the inmate of the right to remain silent at allstages of the disciplinary process but that the inmate's silence may beused to draw an adverse inference against the inmate at any stage of theinstitutional disciplinary process. The investigator shall also informthe inmate that the inmate's silence alone may not be used to support afinding that the inmate has committed a prohibited act. The investigatorshall then thoroughly investigate the incident. The investigator shallrecord all steps and actions taken on the Incident Report and forward allrelevant material to the staff holding the initial hearing. The inmatedoes not receive a copy of the investigation. However, if the case is ultimatelyforwarded to the Discipline Hearing Officer, the DHO shall give a copyof the investigation and other relevant materials to the inmate's staffrepresentative for use in presentation on the inmate's behalf.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 541.15</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Initial hearing.</ITAG>The Warden shall delegate to one or more institution staff members theauthority and duty to hold an initial hearing upon completion of the investigation.In order to ensure impartiality, the appropriate staff member(s) (hereinafterusually referred to as the Unit Discipline Committee (UDC)) may not bethe reporting or investigating officer or a witness to the incident, orplay any significant part in having the charges referred to the UDC. However,a staff member witnessing an incident may serve on the UDC where virtuallyevery staff member in the institution witnesses the incident in whole orin part. If the UDC finds at the initial hearing that an inmate has committeda prohibited act, the UDC may impose minor dispositions and sanctions.When an alleged violation of Bureau rules is serious and warrants considerationfor other than minor sanctions, the UDC shall refer the charges to theDiscipline Hearing Officer for further hearing. The UDC must refer allgreatest category charges to the DHO. The following minimum standards applyto initial hearings in all institutions.(a) Staff shall give each inmate charged with violating a Bureau rule awritten copy of the charge(s) against the inmate, ordinarily within 24hours of the time staff became aware of the inmate's involvement in theincident. (b) Each inmate so charged is entitled to an initial hearing before theUDC, ordinarily held within three work days from the time staff becameaware of the inmate's involvement in the incident. This three work dayperiod excludes the day staff became aware of the inmate's involvementin the incident, weekends, and holidays.(c) The inmate is entitled to be present at the initial hearing exceptduring deliberations of the decision maker(s) or when institutional securitywould be jeopardized by the inmate's presence. The UDC shall clearly documentin the record of the hearing reasons for excluding an inmate from the hearing.An inmate may waive the right to be present at this hearing provided thatthe waiver is documented by staff and reviewed by the UDC. A waiver maybe in writing, signed by the inmate, or if the inmate refuses to sign awaiver, it shall be shown by a memorandum signed by staff and witnessedby a second staff member indicating the inmate's refusal to appear at thehearing. The UDC may conduct a hearing in the absence of an inmate whenthe inmate waives the right to appear. When an inmate escapes or is otherwiseabsent from custody, the UDC shall conduct a hearing in the inmate's absenceat the institution in which the inmate was last confined. (d) The inmate is entitled to make a statement and to present documentaryevidence in the inmate's own behalf.(e) The Unit Discipline Committee may drop or informally resolve any Moderateor Low Moderate charge. The UDC shall expunge the inmate's file of theIncident Report if informal resolution is accomplished. (f) The Unit Discipline Committee shall consider all evidence presentedat the hearing and shall make a decision based on at least some facts,and if there is conflicting evidence, it must be based on the greater weightof the evidence. The UDC shall take one of the following actions: (1) Find that the inmate committed the prohibited act charged and/or asimilar prohibited act if reflected in the Incident Report;(2) Find that the inmate did not commit the prohibited act charged or asimilar prohibited act if reflected in the Incident Report; or (3) Refer the case to the DHO for further hearing:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The UDC shall give the inmate a written copy of the decision and dispositionby the close of business the next work day. Any action taken as a minordisposition is reviewable under the Administration Remedy Procedure (seePart 542 of this Chapter). (g) The UDC shall prepare a record of its proceedings which need not beverbatim. A record of the hearing and supporting documents are kept inthe inmate's file. (h) When an alleged violation of Bureau rules is serious and warrants considerationfor other than minor sanctions (G through P), the UDC shall refer the charge(s)without indication of findings as to commission of the alleged violationto the Discipline Hearing Officer (DHO) for hearing and disposition. TheUDC shall forward copies of all relevant documents to the DHO with a briefstatement of reasons for the referral along with any recommendations forappropriate disposition if the DHO finds the inmate has committed the actcharged and/or a similar prohibited act. The inmate whose charge is beingreferred to the Discipline Hearing Officer may be retained in administrativedetention or other restricted status, but the UDC may not impose a finaldisposition if the matter is being referred to the DHO. (i) When charges are to be referred to the Discipline Hearing Officer,the UDC shall advise the inmate of the rights afforded at a hearing beforethe DHO. The UDC shall ask the inmate to indicate a choice of staff representative,if any, and the names of any witnesses the inmate wishes to be called totestify at the hearing and what testimony they are expected to provide.The UDC shall advise the inmate that the inmate may waive the right tobe present at the Institution Discipline hearing, but still elect to havewitnesses and/or a staff representative appear in the inmate's behalf atthis hearing. (j) When the Unit Discipline Committee holds a full hearing and determinesthat the inmate did not commit a prohibited act of High, Moderate or LowModerate Severity, the UDC shall expunge the inmate's file of the IncidentReport and related documents. The UDC must refer to the Discipline HearingOfficer all incidents involving prohibited acts of Greatest Severity.(k) The UDC may extend time limits imposed in this section for a good causeshown by the inmate or staff and documented in the record of the hearing.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 541.16</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Establishment and functioning of the Discipline Hearing Officer. </ITAG>(a) Each Bureau of Prison institution shall have an independent hearingofficer (DHO) assigned to conduct administrative fact-finding hearingscovering alleged acts of misconduct and violations of prohibited acts,including those acts which could result in criminal charges. In the eventof a serious disturbance or other emergency, of if an inmate commits anoffense in the presence of the DHO, an alternate Discipline Hearing Officerwill be appointed to conduct hearings with approval of the appropriateRegional Director. If the institution's DHO is not able to conduct hearings,the Warden shall arrange for another DHO to conduct the hearings. Thisperson must be trained and certified as a DHO, and meet the other requirementsfor DHO.(b) In order to insure impartiality, the DHO may not be the reporting officer,investigating officer, or UDC member, or a witness to the incident or playany significant part in having the charge(s) referred to the DHO. (c) The Discipline Hearing Officer shall conduct hearings, make findings,and impose appropriate sanctions for incidents of inmate miscounduct referredfor disposition following the hearing required by andSection; 541.15 beforethe UDC. The DHO may not hear any case or impose any sanctions in a casenot heard and referred by the UDC. Only the Discipline Hearing Officershall have the authority to impose or suspend sanctions A through F. (d) The Warden at each institution shall designate a staff member, hereinaftercalled the Segregation Review Official (SRO), to conduct reviews of inmatesplaced in disciplinary segregation and administrative detention in accordancewith the requirements of andSection; 541.20 and andSection; 541.22.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 541.17</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures before the Discipline Hearing Officer.</ITAG>The Discipline Hearing Officer shall proceed as follows:(a) The Warden shall give an inmate advance written notice of the charge(s)against the inmate no less than 24 hours before the inmate's appearancebefore the Discipline Hearing Officer unless the inmate is to be releasedfrom custody within that time. An inmate may waive in writing the 24-hournotice requirement.(b) The Warden shall provide an inmate the service of a full time staffmember to represent the inmate at the hearing before the Discipline HearingOfficer should the inmate so desire. The Warden, the DHO or alternate DHO,the reporting officer, investigating officer, a witness to the incident,and UDC members involved in the case may not act as staff representative.The Warden may exclude staff from acting as staff representative in a particularcase when there is a potential conflict in roles. The staff representativeshall be available to assist the inmate if the inmate desires by speakingto witnesses and by presenting favorable evidence to the DHO on the meritsof the charge(s) or in extenuation or mitigation of the charge(s). TheDHO shall arrange for the presence of the staff representative selectedby the inmate. If the staff member selected declines or is unavailablebecause of absence from the institution, the inmate has the option of selectinganother representative, or in the case of an absent staff member of waitinga reasonable period for the staff member's return, or of proceeding withouta staff representative. When several staff members decline this role, theWarden shall promptly appoint a staff representative to assist the inmate.The DHO shall afford a staff representative adequate time to speak withthe inmate and interview requested witnesses where appropriate. While itis expected that a staff member will have had ample time to prepare priorto the hearing, delays in the hearing to allow for adequate preparationmay be ordered by the Discipline Hearing Officer. When it appears thatthe inmate is not able to properly make a presentation on his own behalf(for example, an illiterate inmate), the Warden shall appoint a staff representativefor the inmate, even if one is not requested.(c) The inmate is entitled to make a statement and to present documentaryevidence in the inmate's own behalf. An inmate has the right to submitnames of requested witnesses and have them called to testify and to presentdocuments in the inmate's behalf, provided the calling of witnesses orthe disclosure of documentary evidence does not jeopardize or threateninstitutional or an individual's security. The DHO shall call those witnesseswho have information directly relevant to the charge(s) and who are reasonablyavailable. This may include witnesses from outside of the institution.The inmate charged may be excluded during the appearance of an outsidewitness. The appearance of the outside witness should be in an area ofthe institution in which outside visitors are usually allowed. The DHOneed not call repetitive witnesses. The reporting officer and other adversewitnesses need not be called if their knowledge of the incident is adequatelysummarized in the Incident Report and other investigative materials suppliedto the DHO. The DHO shall request submission of written statements fromunavailable witnesses who have information directly relevant to the charge(s).The DHO shall document reasons for declining to call requested witnessesin the DHO report, or, if the reasons are confidential, in a separate report,not available to the inmate. The inmate's staff representative, or whenthe inmate waives staff representation, the DHO, shall question witnessesrequested by the inmate who are called before the DHO. The inmate who haswaived staff representation may submit questions for requested witnessesin writing to the DHO. The inmate may not question any witness at the hearing.(d) An inmate has the right to be present throughout the DHO hearing exceptduring a period of deliberation or when institutional security would bejeopardized. The DHO must document in the record the reason(s) for excludingan inmate from the hearing. An inmate may waive the right to be presentat the hearing, provided that the waiver is documented by staff and reviewedby the DHO. A waiver may be in writing, signed by the inmate, or if theinmate refuses to sign a waiver, it shall be shown by a memorandum signedby staff and witnessed by a second staff member indicating the inmate'srefusal to appear at the hearing. The DHO may conduct a hearing in theabsence of an inmate when the inmate waives the right to appear. When aninmate escapes or is otherwise absent from custody, the Discipline HearingOfficer shall conduct a hearing in the inmate's absence at the institutionin which the inmate was last confined. When an inmate returns to custodyfollowing absence during which sanctions were imposed by the DHO (or thepredecessor Institution Discipline Committee (IDC)), the Warden shall havethe charges reheard before the Discipline Hearing Officer ordinarily within60 days after the inmate's arrival at the institution to which the inmateis designated after return to custody, and following appearance beforethe Unit Discipline Committee at that institution. The UDC shall ensurethat the inmate has all rights required for appearance before the DisciplineHearing Officer, including delivery of charge(s), advisement of the rightto remain silent and other rights to be exercised before the DisciplineHearing Officer. All the applicable procedural requirements for hearingsbefore the Discipline Hearing Officer apply to this rehearing, except thatwritten statements of witnesses not readily available may be liberallyused instead of in-person witnesses. The DHO upon rehearing may affirmthe earlier action taken, may dismiss the charge(s), may modify the findingof the original DHO as to the offense which was committed, or may modifybut may not increase the sanctions previously imposed in the inmate's absence.(e) The DHO may refer the case back to the UDC for further informationor disposition. The DHO may postpone or, at any time prior to making adecision as to whether or not a prohibited act was committed, may continuethe hearing until a later date whenever further investigation or more evidenceis needed. A postponement or continuance must be for good cause (determinedby the DHO) shown by the inmate or staff and should be documented in therecord of the hearing.(f) The DHO shall consider all evidence presented at the hearing. The decisionof the DHO shall be based on at least some facts, and if there is conflictingevidence, it must be based on the greater weight of the evidence. The DHOshall find that the inmate either:(1) Committed the prohibited act charged and/or a similar prohibited actif reflected in the Incident Report; or (2) Did not commit the prohibited act charged or a similar prohibited actif reflected in the Incident Report.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">When a disciplinary decision is based on confidential informant information,the UDC or DHO shall document, ordinarily in the hearing report, the findingas to the reliability of each confidential informant relied on <T3>and the factual basis for that finding.</T3> When it appears that thisdocumentation in the report would reveal the confidential informant's identity,the finding as to the reliability of each confidential informant reliedon and the factual basis for that finding shall be made part of the hearingrecord in a separate report, prepared by the UDC chairman or DHO, not availableto the inmate.(g) The Discipline Hearing Officer shall prepare a record of the proceedingswhich need not be verbatim. This record must be sufficient to documentthe advisement of inmate rights, the DHO's findings, the DHO's decisionand the specific evidence relied on by the DHO, and must include a briefstatement of the reasons for the sanctions imposed. The evidence reliedupon, the decision, and the reasons for the actions taken must be set outin specific terms unless doing so would jeopardize institutional security.The DHO shall give the inmate a written copy of the decisions and disposition,ordinarily within 10 days of the DHO's decision.(h) A record of the hearing and supporting documents are to be kept inthe inmate central file.(i) The Discipline Hearing Officer shall expunge an inmate's file of theIncident Report and related documents following a DHO finding that theinmate did not commit a prohibited act. The requirement for expunging theinmate's file does not preclude maintaining for research purposes copiesof disciplinary actions resulting in ``not guilty'' findings in a masterfile separate from the inmate's institution file. However, institutionstaff may not use or allow the use of the contents of this master filein a manner which would adversely affect the inmate. Likewise, the expungementrequirement does not require the destruction of medical reports or otherreports relating to a particular inmate which must be maintained to documentmedical or other treatment given in a special housing unit. If an inmate'sconduct during one continuous incident may constitute more than one prohibitedact, and if the incident is reported in a single Incident Report, and ifthe DHO finds the inmate has not committed every prohibited act charged,or if the DHO finds that the inmate has committed a prohibited act(s) otherthan the act(s) charged, then the DHO shall record those findings clearlyand shall change the Incident Report to show only the incident and codereferences to charges which were proved.

The Discipline HearingOfficer may do any of the following:(a) Dismiss any charge(s) upon a finding that the inmate did not committhe prohibited act(s). The DHO shall order the record of charge(s) expungedupon such finding.(b) Impose any of sanctions A through P as provided in andSection; 541.13.(c) Suspend the execution of a sanction it imposes as provided in andSection;541.13. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 541.19 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Appeals from Unit Discipline Committee or Discipline Hearing OfficerActions. </ITAG>At the time the Unit Discipline Committee or Discipline Hearing Officergives an inmate written notice of its decision, the UDC or DHO shall alsoadvise the inmate that the inmate may appeal the decision under AdministrativeRemedy Procedures (see Part 542 of this Chapter). An inmate's initial appealof a decision of the DHO should be filed directly to the appropriate RegionalOffice. The inmate should forward a copy of the DHO report or, if not availableat the time of filing, should state in his appeal the date of the DHO hearingand the nature of the charges against the inmate. On appeals, the appropriatereviewing official (the Warden, Regional Director, or General Counsel)may approve, modify, reverse, or send back with directions, including orderinga rehearing, any disciplinary action of the Unit Discipline Committee orDiscipline Hearing Officer but may not increase any valid sanction imposed.On appeals, the appropriate reviewing authority shall consider: (a) Whether the Unit Discipline Committee or the Discipline Hearing Officersubstantially complied with the regulations on inmate discipline; (b) Whether the Unit Discipline Committee or Discipline Hearing Officerbased its decision on some facts, and if there was conflicting evidence,whether the decision was based on the greater weight of the evidence; and(c) Whether an appropriate sanction was imposed according to the severitylevel of the prohibited act, and other relevant circumstances. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 541.20 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Justification for placement in disciplinary segregation and reviewof inmates in disciplinary segregation. </ITAG>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an inmate maybe placed in disciplinary segregation only by order of the Discipline HearingOfficer following a hearing in which the inmate has been found to havecommitted a prohibited act in the Greatest, High, or Moderate Category,or a repeated offense in the Low Moderate Category. The DHO may order placementin disciplinary segregation only when other available dispositions areinadequate to achieve the purpose of punishment and deterrence necessaryto regulate an inmate's behavior within acceptable limits. (b) The Warden may temporarily (not exceeding five days) move an inmateto a more secure cell (which may be in an area ordinarily set aside fordisciplinary segregation and which therefore requires the withdrawal ofprivileges ordinarily afforded in administrative detention status, untila hearing before the DHO can be held) who (1) is causing a serious disruption(threatening life, serious bodily harm, or property) in administrativedetention, (2) cannot be controlled within the physical confines of administrativedetention, and (3) upon advice of appropriate medical staff, does not requireconfinement in the institution hospital for mental or physical treatment,or who would ordinarily be housed in the institution hospital for mentalor physical treatment, but who cannot safely be housed there because thehospital does not have a room or cell with adequate security provisions.The Warden may delegate this authority no further than to the officialin charge of the institution at the time the move is necessary. (c) The Segregation Review Official (SRO) (see andSection; 541.16(d)) shallconduct a hearing and formally review the status of each inmate who spendsseven continuous days in disciplinary segregation and thereafter shallreview these cases on the record in the inmate's absence each week andshall conduct a hearing and formally review these cases at least once every30 days. The inmate appears before the SRO at the 30-day hearings, unlessthe inmate waives the right to appear. A waiver may be in writing, signedby the inmate, or if the inmate refuses to sign a waiver, it shall be shownby a memorandum signed by staff and witnessed by a second staff memberindicating the inmate's refusal to appear at the hearing. Staff shall conducta psychiatric or psychological assessment, including a personal interview,when disciplinary segregation continues beyond 30 days. The assessment,submitted to the SRO in a written report, shall address the inmate's adjustmentto surroundings and the threat the inmate poses to self, staff and otherinmates. Staff shall conduct a similar psychiatric or psychological assessmentand report at subsequent one-month intervals if segregation continues forthis extended period. (d) The Segregation Review Official may release an inmate from disciplinarysegregation earlier than the sanction initially imposed upon finding thatcontinuation in disciplinary segregation is no longer necessary to regulatethe inmate's behavior within acceptable limits or for fulfilling the purposeof punishment and deterrence which initially resulted in the inmate's placementin disciplinary segregation status. The SRO may not increase any previouslyimposed sanction. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 541.21 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Conditions of disciplinary segregation. </ITAG>(a) Disciplinary segregation is the status of confinement of an inmatehoused in a special housing unit in a cell either alone or with other inmates,separated from the general population. Inmates housed in disciplinary segregationhave significantly fewer privileges than those housed in administrativedetention. (b) The Warden shall maintain for each segregated inmate basic living levelsof decency and humane treatment, regardless of the purpose for which theinmate has been segregated. Living conditions may not be modified for thepurpose of reinforcing acceptable behavior and different levels of livingarrangements will not be established. Where it is determined necessaryto deprive an inmate of a usually authorized item, staff shall preparewritten documentation as to the basis for this action, and this documentwill be signed by the Warden, indicating the Warden's review and approval.(c) The basic living standards for segregation are as follows: (1) <T3>Segregation Conditions. </T3>The quarters used for segregation mustbe well-ventilated, adequately lighted, appropriately heated and maintainedin a sanitary condition at all times. All cells must be equipped with beds.Strip cells may not be a part of the segregation unit. Any strip cellswhich are utilized must be a part of the medical facility and under thesupervision and control of the medical staff.(2) <T3>Cell Occupancy.</T3> The number of inmates confined to each cell orroom in segregation should not exceed the number for which the space wasdesignated. The Warden may approve excess occupancy if the Warden findsthere is a pressing need for this action, and that other basic living standardsof this subsection can still be maintained.(3) <T3>Clothing and Bedding.</T3> An inmate in segregation may wear normalinstitution clothing but may not have a belt. Staff shall furnish a mattressand bedding. Cloth or paper slippers may be substituted for shoes at thediscretion of the Warden. An inmate may not be segregated without clothing,mattress, blankets and pillow, except when prescribed by the medical officerfor medical or psychiatric reasons. Inmates in special housing status willbe provided, as nearly as practicable, the same opportunity for the issueand exchange of clothing, bedding, and linen, and for laundry as inmatesin the general population. Exceptions to this procedure may be permittedonly when found necessary by the Warden or designee. An exception, andthe reasons for this, must be recorded in the unit log.(4) <T3>Food.</T3> Staff shall give a segregated inmate nutritionally adequatemeals, ordinarily from the menu of the day for the institution. Staff maydispense disposable utensils when necessary.(5) <T3>Personal Hygiene.</T3> Segregated inmates shall have the opportunityto maintain an acceptable level of personal hygiene. Staff shall providetoilet tissue, wash basin, tooth brush, eyeglasses, shaving utensils, etc.,as needed. Staff may issue a retrievable kit of toilet articles. Each segregatedinmate shall have the opportunity to shower and shave at least three timesa week, unless these procedures would present an undue security hazard.This security hazard will be documented and signed by the Warden, indicatingthe Warden's review and approval. Inmates in special housing will be provided,where practicable, barbering and hair care services. Exceptions to thisprocedure may be permitted only when found necessary by the Warden or designee.(6) <T3>Exercise.</T3> Staff shall permit each segregated inmate no less thanfive hours exercise each week. Exercise should be provided in five one-hourperiods, on five different days, but if circumstances require, one-halfhour periods are acceptable if the five-hour minimum and different daysschedule is maintained. These provisions must be carried out unless compellingsecurity or safety reasons dictate otherwise. Institution staff shall documentthese reasons. Exercise periods, not to exceed one week, may be withheldfrom an inmate by order of the Warden, following a hearing, and recommendation,before a person certified in the discipline hearing officer procedures.This hearing must be held in accordance with the provisions of andSection;541.17, following those provisions which are appropriate to these circumstances,and only upon a finding by the person conducting the hearing that the actionsof the segregated inmate pose a threat to the safety or health conditionsof the unit.(7) <T3>Personal Property.</T3> Institution staff shall ordinarily impoundpersonal property.(8) <T3>Reading Material.</T3> Staff shall provide a reasonable amount of non-legalreading material, not to exceed five books per inmate at any one time,on a circulating basis. Staff shall provide the inmate opportunity to possessreligious scriptures of the inmate's faith. As to legal materials, seePart 543, Subpart B.(9) <T3>Supervision.</T3> In addition to the direct supervision afforded bythe unit officer, a member of the medical department and one or more responsibleofficers designated by the Warden (ordinarily a Lieutenant) shall see eachsegregated inmate daily, including weekends and holidays. Members of theprogram staff, including unit staff, shall arrange to visit inmates inspecial housing within a reasonable time after receiving the inmate's request.(10) <T3>Correspondence and Visits.</T3> As to correspondence privileges, seePart 540, Subpart B. Staff shall make reasonable effort to notify approvedsocial visitors of any necessary restriction on ordinary visiting proceduresso that they may be spared disappointment and unnecessary inconvenience.If ample time for corresondence exists, staff may place the burden of thisnotification to visitors on the inmate. As to general visiting and telephoneprivileges, see Part 540, Subpart D and Subpart I. In respect to legal,religious, and privileged out-going mail, the relevant regulations mustbe followed by institution staff (see Parts 540, 543, and 548 of this Chapter).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 541.22 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Administrative Detention. </ITAG>Administrative detention is the status of confinement of an inmate in aspecial housing unit in a cell either by self or with other inmates whichserves to remove the inmate from the general population.(a) <T3>Placement in Administrative Detention.</T3> The Warden may delegateauthority to place an inmate in administrative detention to Lieutenants.Prior to the inmate's placement in administrative detention, the Lieutenantis to review the available information and determine whether the inmate'splacement in administrative detention is warranted. The Warden may placean inmate in administrative detention when the inmate is in holdover status(i.e., en route to a designated institution) during transfer, or is a newcommitment pending classification. The Warden may also place an inmatein administrative detention when the inmate's continued presence in thegeneral population poses a serious threat to life, property, self, staff,other inmates or to the security or orderly running of the institutionand when the inmate:(1) Is pending a hearing for a violation of Bureau regulations;(2) Is pending an investigation of a violation of Bureau regulations;(3) Is pending investigation or trial for a criminal act;(4) Is pending transfer;(5) Requests admission to administrative detention for the inmate's ownprotection, or staff determines that admission to or continuation in administrativedetention is necessary for the inmate's own protection (see andSection; 541.23);or(6) Is terminating confinement in disciplinary segregation and placementin general population is not prudent. The Segregation Review Official isto advise the inmate of this determination and the reasons for such action.(i) In Security Level 1 through 5 and in Administrative type institutions,staff ordinarily within 90 days of an inmate's placement in post-disciplinarydetention, shall, except for pre-trial inmates, either return the inmateto the general inmate population or request regional level assistance toeffect a transfer to a more suitable institution.(ii) The Assistant Director, Correctional Programs Division, shall reviewfor purpose of making a disposition, the case of an inmate not transferredfrom post-disciplinary detention within the time frame specified in paragraph(a)(6)(i) of this section.(iii) In Security Level 6 institutions, staff will attempt to adhere tothe 90-day limit for an inmate's placement in post-disciplinary detention.Because security needs required for an inmate in a Security Level 6 institutionmay not be available outside of post-disciplinary detention, the Wardenmay approve an extension of this placement upon determining in writingthat it is not practicable to release the inmate to the general inmatepopulation or to effect a transfer to a more suitable institution.(iv) The appropriate Regional Director and the Assistant Director, CorrectionalPrograms Division, shall review for purpose of making a disposition, thecase of an inmate in a Security Level 6 institution not transferred frompost-disciplinary detention within the 90-day time frame specified in paragraph(a)(6)(iii) of this section. A similar, subsequent review shall be conductedevery 60-90 days if post-disciplinary detention continues for this extendedperiod.(b) <T3>Memorandum Detailing Reasons For Placement.</T3> The Warden shall preparea memorandum detailing the reasons for placing an inmate in administrativedetention, with a copy given to the inmate, provided institutional securityis not compromised thereby. Staff shall deliver this memorandum to theinmate within 24 hours of the inmate's placement in administrative detention,unless this delivery is precluded by exceptional circumstances. A memorandumis not necessary for an inmate placed in administrative detention whenthis placement is a direct result of the inmate's holdover status.(c) <T3>Review of Inmates Housed in Administrative Detention.</T3> (1) Exceptas otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section,the Segregation Review Official will review the status of inmates housedin administrative detention. The SRO shall conduct a record review withinthree work days of the inmate's placement in administrative detention andshall hold a hearing and formally review the status of each inmate whospends seven continuous days in administrative detention, and thereaftershall review these cases on the record (in the inmate's absence) each week,and shall hold a hearing and review these cases formally at least every30 days. The inmate appears before the SRO at the hearing unless the inmatewaives the right to appear. A waiver may be in writing, signed by the inmate,or if the inmate refuses to sign a waiver, it shall be shown by a memorandumsigned by staff and witnessed by a second staff member indicating the inmate'srefusal to appear at the hearing. Staff shall conduct a psychiatric orpsychological assessment, including a personal interview, when administrativedetention continues beyond 30 days. The assessment, submitted to the SROin a written report, shall address the inmate's adjustment to surroundingsand the threat the inmate poses to self, staff and other inmates. Staffshall conduct a similar psychiatric or psychological assessment and reportat subsequent one-month intervals should detention continue for this extendedperiod. Administrative detention is to be used only for short periods oftime except where an inmate needs long-term protection (see andSection; 541.23),or where there are exceptional circumstances, ordinarily tied to securityor complex investigative concerns. An inmate may be kept in administrativedetention for longer term protection only if the need for such protectionis documented by the SRO. Provided institutional security is not compromised,the inmate shall receive at each formal review a written copy of the SRO'sdecision and the basis for this finding. The SRO shall release an inmatefrom administrative detention when reasons for placement cease to exist.(2) The Warden shall designate appropriate staff to meet weekly with aninmate in administrative detention when this placement is a direct resultof the inmate's holdover status. Staff shall also review this type of caseon the record each week.(3) When an inmate is placed in administrative detention for protection,but not at that inmate's request, the Warden or designee is to review theinmate's status within two work days of this placement to determine ifcontinued protective custody is necessary. A formal hearing is to be heldwithin seven days of the inmate's placement (see andSection; 541.23, ProtectionCases).(d) <T3>Conditions of Administrative Detention.</T3> The basic level of conditionsas described in andSection; 541.21(c) for disciplinary segregation also applyto administrative detention. If consistent with available resources andthe security needs of the unit, the Warden shall give an inmate housedin administrative detention the same general privileges given to inmatesin the general population. This includes, but is not limited to, providingan inmate with the opportunity for participation in an education program,library services, social services, counseling, religious guidance and recreation.Unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary, institutions shallprovide commissary privileges and reasonable amounts of personal property.An inmate in administrative detention shall be permitted to have a radio,provided that the radio is equipped with ear plugs. Exercise periods, ata minimum, will meet the level established for disciplinary segregationand will exceed this level where resources are available. The Warden shallgive an inmate in administrative detention visiting, telephone, and correspondenceprivileges in accordance with Part 540 of this Chapter. The Warden mayrestrict for reasons of security, fire safety, or housekeeping the amountof personal property that an inmate may retain while in administrativedetention.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 541.23 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Protection cases.</ITAG>(a) Staff may consider the following categories of inmates as protectioncases:(1) Victims of inmate assaults;(2) Inmate informants;(3) Inmates who have received inmate pressure to participate in sexualactivity;(4) Inmates who seek protection through detention, claiming to be formerlaw enforcement officers, informants, or others in sensitive law enforcementpositions, whether or not there is official information to verify the claim;(5) Inmates who have previously served as inmate gun guards, dog caretakers,or in similar positions in state or local correctional facilities;(6) Inmates who refuse to enter the general population because of allegedpressures from other unidentified inmates;(7) Inmates who will not provide, and as to whom staff cannot determine,the reason for refusal to return to the general population; and(8) Inmates about whom staff has good reason to believe the inmate is inserious danger of bodily harm.(b) Inmates who are placed in administrative detention for protection,but not at their own request or beyond the time when they feel they needto be detained for their own protection, are entitled to a hearing, nolater than seven days from the time of their admission (or from the timeof their detention beyond their own consent).
