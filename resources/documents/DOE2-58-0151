<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-58-0151 </DOCNO><TEXT>The AVIRIS instrument has a separate dedicated analog signal processingchain for each of its four spectrometers. The signal chains amplify low-levelfocal-plane line array signals (5 to 10 mV full-scale span) in the presenceof larger multiplexing signals (approx 150 mV) providing the data handlingsystem a ten-bit digital word (for each spectrometer) each 1.3 microns.This signal chain provides automatic correction for the line array darksignal nonuniformity (which can approach the full-scale signal span).</TEXT></DOC>
