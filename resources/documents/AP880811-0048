Arias died of a heart attack here Wednesday, five days short ofhis 87th birthday. He had lived here in self-imposed exile.   The Panamanian government decreed Monday a day of mourning forArias, the patriarch of Panamanian politics.   The Panamanian flag will be flown at half staff for eight daysstarting Monday, Arias' birthday and the day he is to be buried inPanama City.   Arias, whose presidential terms were ended by military coups,arrived here in December. He feared to return to Panama because ofhis opposition to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the nation's defacto leader.   ``If he had gone back, the military would have killed him,''said Roberto Dominguez, Panamanian consul to the United States andwho opposes Noriega.   Although Arias reportedly suffered from heart trouble, he hadbeen in good health recently. Arias' wife, Mireya, was with himwhen he died at his home, Dominguez said.   Relatives said Arias' body will be flown to Panama City onFriday.   Arias was called by opposition leaders ``a great rebel'' and``the indisputable leader'' of Panama for the past 57 years. He waspresident in 1940-41, 1949-51 and for 11 days in 1968.   The last coup led to the long domination of the Panamaniangovernment by the military, first under Gen. Omar Torrijos, whodied in a 1981 plane crash, then under Noriega.   Arias, head of the Authentic Panamanian Party, narrowly lost the1984 election to the official party's candidate. His supporters andothers accused the government of fraud. Many also felt the militarystole a 1964 electoral victory from him.   He continued to speak out against the military, and in 1986 saidit killed opposition leader Dr. Hugo Spadafora, who had accusedNoriega's government of involvement with drugs.   Noriega was indicted in Florida this year for alleged drugtrafficking.   Opposition leaders in Panama expressed sorrow over Arias' death.   Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of the Christian DemocraticParty, said the former president represented ``the figure of agreat rebel'' who had a social conscience and was ``concerned aboutthose who have less and for those who suffer more.''   Guillermo Endara, undersecretary of the Authentic Party, saidArias was ``the indisputable leader'' of Panama for the past 57years.   Carlos Ivan Zuniga, president of the Popular Action Party, said,``There is no doubt that his death is going to constitute atremendous uncertainty, leave a vacuum.''   Born when Panama was still part of Colombia, Arias was educatedin the United States and became active in his new nation's politicsin 1931, when he helped engineer a coup against the president.   He later served as ambassador to France and England, and inEurope became enamored of Mussolini's fascism. He returned toadvocate it in Panama, and was elected president in 1940.   The United States, worried about his connections to the Axispowers on the eve of World War II, encouraged a military coupagainst him. But he returned to power with more moderate views in1948, and is credited with founding his nation's highly regardedsocial security system.</TEXT></DOC>
