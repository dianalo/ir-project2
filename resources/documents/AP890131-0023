WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Rep. Jim Jones' withdrawal from the racefor chairman of the Democratic National Committee clears the fieldfor former Jesse Jackson aide Ronald Brown to assume the top partyjob next month.   Jones became the last opponent of Brown to drop out of the raceMonday, when he conceded Brown had enough votes on the 404-membercommittee to assure his election next week.   ``I don't see prolonging a campaign that is outvoted,'' Jonessaid.   Brown's election to the top Democratic Party job was assured lastweek when three other rivals for the post dropped out and endorsedhim. Although Jones briefly continued his challenge, Brown claimedhe had enough votes to win and there was near-unanimous agreementwithin the party that he did.   The Democratic National Committee meets in Washington on Feb. 10to select a new chairman to replace Paul Kirk, who is giving up thejob.   Jones, a former congessman from Oklahoma, said he spoke withBrown on Sunday and congratulated him for winning.   Brown was Democratic National Convention manager for presidentialhopeful Jackson last year. Some of Brown's opponents had cited histies to Jackson, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and New York Gov.Mario Cuomo as evidence he would give ammunition to Republicanstrying to paint the Democrats as too liberal.   Brown met over the weekend with Jewish leaders in Denver in anattempt to put to rest concerns about his views on Israel, whichwere raised because of his association with Jackson.   Jones, in announcing his withdrawal, said he would still addressthe DNC members during their two-day meeting in Washington and wouldcontinue efforts ``to move the party to a more centrist position.''   He said Brown ``has to take some steps that will show trueindependence'' and display a commitment to winning back Southern andWestern voters to the Democratic Party.   He warned that the party is perceived by many as too liberal,that voting trends are moving against Democrats and that they couldlose control of Congress and find themselves a true minority partyin coming years.   ``The Democratic Party could go the way of the British LaborParty unless we make some fundamental changes in our message andimage,'' he said.   ``If the Democrats keep sweeping under the rug the fact that weare losing moderate voters, that we're losing adult white malevoters, that we're losing white and ethnic minority young voters, ifwe keep sweeping those statistics under the rug and failing to faceup to them, we are really buying our own doom,'' Jones said.</TEXT></DOC>
