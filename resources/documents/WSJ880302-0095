But the company is moving more cautiously than ever before, concentrating its efforts in a series of joint ventures and spin-offs of existing publications.    &quot;We want to develop new magazines for the 1990s, but on a more informal basis than in the past,&quot; said Reginald Brack, president and chief executive officer of the magazine group. &quot;And we aren't going to go off and test things until we have a high confidence level in them.&quot;    Time's caution is well-placed. Time eliminated its formal magazine development group last year as part of a companywide effort to slash costs. The group spent millions to develop a number of magazines and exhaustively tested at least one, Picture Week, before deciding the idea didn't merit a full-scale commitment. Other magazines it also tested and later killed: Quality, Leisure, Home Office, and a regional real estate magazine.    In an interview, Mr. Brack said the company doesn't expect to revive any of those titles and said their development was a &quot;distraction&quot; during last year's magazine-group retrenchment, which included layoffs and other cost-cutting. However, he said the company has &quot;at least three potential magazines in one stage of development or another&quot; and is looking at several other ideas, including a general interest magazine aimed at older readers.    For example, Time is a minority investor in Emerge, a proposed monthly news magazine developed by former Time magazine writer Wilmer Ames for black middle-class readers. Time provided subscriber lists and helped in two direct mail tests that offered free premier issues to gauge subscriber interest; results are still being evaluated.    Meanwhile, via its 50-50 joint venture with Dale Lang, the publisher of Working Woman and McCall's magazines, Time will test America Entertains, a spin-off of McCall's monthly food and home entertainment sections. The first issue will be on newsstands in April and will be published quarterly through 1989; if successful, the magazine will come out 10 times a year.    Time is also developing a children's version of its highly successful Sports Illustrated that Mr. Brack said is aimed at encouraging literacy while expanding the magazine's reach. He also said the magazine is developing a line of travel and vacation publications on such subjects as how to play golf, to be distributed by resort operators.    At Time magazine, meanwhile, editors are looking for ways to package the magazine's output in more permanent form, Mr. Brack said. For example, New American Library will shortly distribute hardcover and paperback versions of &quot;Mikhail S. Gorbachev: An Intimate Biography.&quot; The 288-page book is based on Time magazine's Man of the Year issue featuring the Soviet leader.    With the disbanding of the formal development operations, &quot;one of the main goals of every publisher and managing editor is to examine potential expansions or line extensions of their properties,&quot; Mr. Brack said.    The magazine group includes Time, Life, Sports Illustrated, Money, People, Fortune and the Southern Progress subsidiary's regional magazines. </TEXT></DOC>
