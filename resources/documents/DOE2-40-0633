Radiation doses ranged from 700 to 2400 Gy, depending onboth clinical response and hematological toxicity. Relief of symptomswas observed in all patients (100%); reduction of splenic size rangedfrom 30 to 70%, with more than 50% reduction in 13/16 cases. Side effectswere mild neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, which did not required interructionof tratement; four patients registered a severe anemia. All the hematologicalside-effects stopped with the suspension of treatement. This study showsthe beneficial effect of radiation therapy on the symptoms connectedto splenomegaly; however, the short duration of response suggest theadvantage of splenic low-dose irradiation, to be periodically repeated.</TEXT></DOC>
