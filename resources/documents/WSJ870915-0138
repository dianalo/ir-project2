While the value of the planned asset sale hasn't been officially set, senior Fermenta officials said they expect Trans-Resources to pay about the 1.37 billion Swedish kronor ($216 million) it had considered spending for all of Fermenta's stock under the previous plan.    Trans-Resources, a privately held, New York-based chemicals and fertilizers group, decided to drop its takeover plan Aug. 26 after meeting resistance from Fermenta's bank creditors, which are owed about four billion kronor and control much of the company's stock. Like that plan, the newly planned asset sale is conditional upon acceptance by creditors and shareholders.    Officials at Fermenta and Industrivaerden AB, Fermenta's biggest shareholder, said they expect the new preliminary agreement to win acceptance quickly from bankers, but they wouldn't elaborate on why the new plan is more favorable than Trans-Resources' previous proposed bid. The officials and some bankers said talks on the plan started between Fermenta, Industrivaerden, Trans-Resources and major creditors almost as soon as the first proposal fell through.    One banker familiar with the new plan said it calls for Trans-Resources to assume the bulk of Fermenta's liabilities outstanding, with only limited write-downs. Fermenta would pay off the remainder of its debts using some of the cash and promissory notes it would receive from Trans-Resources in payment for its assets.    Bertil Holmberg, Fermenta's president and chief executive officer, wouldn't comment on the precise terms of the planned transaction but said he is optimistic that the new plan will be accepted by Fermenta's creditors and shareholders once the company's board reaches a final agreement with Trans-Resources. He predicted that agreement would come within &quot;a couple weeks&quot; and said the plan would be put to a shareholders vote at an extraordinary meeting sometime in mid-October.    &quot;We think this is a very promising deal for shareholders,&quot; Mr. Holmberg said.    According to a brief announcement yesterday from Fermenta, shareholders will be asked to approve the sale to Trans-Resources of all of Fermenta's major operating divisions. Only a majority vote will be necessary for passage, in contrast to the 90% appproval that Trans-Resources' proposed takeover would have required to succeed.    Included in the planned sale would be most of Fermenta's marginally profitable pharmaceuticals and related fermentation facilities; its Mentor, Ohio-based SDS Biotech Corp. unit, a profitable agricultural-chemicals and animal-health speciality concern; and its loss-making Pierrel S.p.A. unit in Italy, which markets pharmaceuticals under license from abroad. The only major unit exempted from the sale would be Fermenta's bulk-penicillin factory at Straengnaes, Sweden, which can't be sold without special government approval.    After the sale, Fermenta would consist of several minor operating companies and a still-undetermined amount of cash. Mr. Holmberg said the company hasn't yet decided whether it would change its name or business activities if the plan goes through. &quot;We have a lot of ideas, but we want to concentrate on this deal with Trans-Resources for now,&quot; he said.    Bo Soederberg, an Industrivaerden director and Fermenta's deputy chairman, said he believes the new plan would free Fermenta to grow again. &quot;You create a new company where you have no risk and a lot of cash,&quot; Mr. Soederberg said. &quot;There are real possibilities there.&quot;    For Trans-Resources, a successful acquisition of Fermenta's major businesses would be a major boost to the scope of its existing operations. Last year, Trans-Resources reported net income of $7.9 million on revenue of $103.6 million, mainly from its fertilizer subsidiary, Haifa Chemicals Ltd. of Israel. Fermenta, by contrast, reported a loss of 613 million kronor on revenue of 3.03 billion kronor.    Trans-Resources is owned by a group of investors headed by Meshulam Riklis, a New York financier, and including Arie Genger, a former Israeli defense official. Until last year, Fermenta was controlled by its former president, Egyptian-born Refaat el-Sayed, who was forced out of the company last December amid allegations of financial and managerial improprieties.    Trading in Fermenta's shares was halted last Thursday pending yesterday's announcements, but brokers in Stockholm said there had been little activity in the shares since the first Trans-Resources offer collapsed. The shares, which have traded only unofficially since Fermenta was expelled from the Stockholm Stock Exchange in January, were last quoted at around six kronor (95 cents). </TEXT></DOC>
