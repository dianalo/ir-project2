It quoted an opposition leader, Isidro Tellez of theMarxist-Leninist Party, as saying Ortega made those points at ameeting with members of the opposition.   According to Barricada, Tellez quoted Ortega as saying he wouldbring it up at the Central American summit that starts Monday.   The reported offer would move toward compliance with a dormantCentral American peace plan that the Central American presidents aretrying to revive.   Ortega has been meeting with Tellez and other political foes toseek broad support for tough austerity measures Nicaragua needs tosave itself from economic disaster.   ``Tellez ... revealed that President Ortega has stated theviability of an immediate amnesty for all the former Somocistaguards and even the possibility of early elections,'' Barricadareported. Elections are now scheduled for November 1990.   The leftist Sandinistas came to power in 1979 in a popularrevolution that ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza. The governmentsaid on Dec. 10 that it still had 1,744 former members of Somoza'sNational Guard in custody and that it had an additional 1,398members of the anti-Sandinista rebel movement in jail.   Tellez quoted Ortega as saying amnesty for the U.S.-backedrebels, known as Contras, would hinge on whether thousands ofContras still based on the Nicaraguan border in Honduras would laydown their arms, Barricada reported.   The U.S. Congress cut off military aid to the Contras in February1988. A month later the Sandinistas and Contras signed a cease-fireagreement. The level of fighting in Nicaragua has dropped sharplysince then, although some still occurs.   Four rebels were killed and two were injured in fighting in thenorthern province of Matagalpa on Thursday, a Sandinista militaryspokesman said. He said no Sandinista soldiers were hurt.   Ortega and the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala andCosta Rica are to meet in El Salvador on Monday.   The foreign ministers of the five nations asked the UnitedNations on Wednesday to send a multinational force of inspectors toCentral America to verify that no country supports subversionagainst its neighbors.</TEXT></DOC>
