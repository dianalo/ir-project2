In recent months, Mr. Dole has been increasingly outspokenin challenging U.S. aid to Israel, and the tension yesterdayreflected a growing concern among Republicans that theharshness of his tone is hurting the party going into thefall elections. The Kansas senator said it was &quot;bunk&quot; for hiscritics to paint him as &quot;anti-Israel.&quot; But among his ownJewish backers, his published comments during a recent tripto the Mideast has provoked concern.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;He's not only hurt himself, but he's hurt his party,&quot;said a past Jewish contributor to Mr. Dole. &quot;I think hisremarks are mean-spirited.&quot;   The flurry of letters yesterday pitted Mr. Dole mostdirectly against House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich. And theconservative support for Israel reflects an alliance thatgrew stronger under the Reagan administration. The 1988 GOPplatform was striking in its support of pro-Israel positions,and even as the Bush administration and Secretary of StateJames Baker have signaled a shift in policy, conservativeshave sought to build on ties to Jerusalem and Jewishcontributors at home.   &quot;We firmly support our party's platform,&quot; said Mr.Gingrich in a letter signed by himself and three othermembers of the House leadership. &quot;For this reason, we takeissue with your statements on aid to Israel and the status ofJerusalem.&quot;   Rep. Vin Weber (R., Minn.), who also signed the letter andis expected to move soon into the House Republican campaignstructure, said, &quot;Bush and Baker have taken a differentapproach and that has caused some uneasiness. What Dole isdoing is far more destructive.&quot;   While Mr. Dole has won praise for his willingness toquestion the pro-Israel lobby, he has hurt himself by seemingto reverse his positions from one month to the next. Hisinitial proposal to impose a 5% cut in foreign aid to Israeland other major recipient countries appeared hastilyprepared, and came even as he was signaling support for newaid to help build housing for Soviet Jews in Israel. He hassince moved away from a proposal to help finance suchhousing. And after being among the first sponsors last monthof a pro-Israel resolution calling for a unified Jerusalem,he now says the legislation is harmful to peace in the regionand his own support of it was a mistake.   Mindful of the House criticism, Senate GOP Whip AlanSimpson (R., Wyo.) rose last night to defend Mr. Dole, whosaid in turn that he would match his record on Israel againstthat of any other member of Congress. But the KansasRepublican and former presidential hopeful is described asresentful that he didn't receive more financial support fromJewish contributors in the past. More recently, Mr. Dole wasangered when pro-Israel forces -- in alliance with theTurkish lobby -- helped to undercut his efforts to winpassage of a resolution commemorating the Armenian massacres.And he has portrayed the leadership of the pro-Israel lobbyas shortsighted and selfish.   In January, when Mr. Dole first proposed redistributingforeign aid, Mr. Gingrich praised him for showing &quot;greatcourage.&quot; As a postscript to his own letter, the senatorneedled the Georgia conservative yesterday by reminding himof his praise then. &quot;Weren't those words for publicconsumption?&quot; asked Mr. Dole of Mr. Gingrich.</TEXT></DOC>
