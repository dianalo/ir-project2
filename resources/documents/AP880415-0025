SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For the last century or so mankind has beenengaged in an unintentional experiment with the Earth's climate.The results should be available soon, a scientist reports today.   Warming of the Earth, caused by industrial gases spilled intothe atmosphere, could soon be large enough to measure withassurance, said V. Ramanathan of the University of Chicago.   ``Thus, the greenhouse theory of climate change has reached thecrucial stage of verification because of the inadvertent experimentbeing performed on the atmosphere by human activities,'' Ramanathanreported in the journal Science.   ``In a decade or two we should start to see something. If not,then it's time to go back to the drawing boards,'' Ramanathan saidin a telephone interview.   ``The one fly in the ointment,'' he cautioned, is that therelatively small changes seen so far have occurred in steps and notgradually.   Thus, if climate waits until the gases build up to a point to``kick'' over a change, it may take longer to see warming, he said.In that case, significant changes might take 20 to 50 years, hesaid.   Signs could include larger temperature rises in polar areas thannear the equator; less precipitation in the middle latitudes wheremany crops are grown, and a rise in ocean levels, Ramanathan said.   Industrial gases can lead to climate change because they actsomewhat like the glass of a greenhouse, allowing energy from thesun to come to Earth, but trapping some of the heat that previouslywould have radiated back out into space. Such gases include carbondioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons.   This trapped energy drives the Earth's climate out of balance,says Ramanathan.   If the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continues,he adds, ``the cumulative surface warming would, in the next twodecades, become large enough to manifest itself unambiguously.''   ``The predicted changes, during the next few decades, could farexceed the natural climate variations in historical times,'' hewrote.   Measurements over the last century or so indicate that theplanet has warmed about 1 degree Fahrenheit. That amount of changecould just be part of the natural variation in climate, he said.   But if concentrations of greenhouse gases continue increasing,theoretical models indicate the warming could total as much as 8degrees Fahrenheit during the next century, a change Ramanathantermed ``unprecedented.''   Still in question, though, are the consequences of such a change.   For example, the warming could cause some melting of polar ice,a process that would tend to accelerate the warming even more byincreasing the sunlight absorbed by the darker underlying water orland surfaces, Ramanathan reported.   Ice melting could cause an increase in ocean levels, causingwidespread flooding of coastal areas, scientists have warned. Andmany have expressed concern that the warming could cause changes ingeneral weather and climate patterns.   Another area of uncertainty, Ramanathan wrote, is that of cloudformation.   Warmer temperatures might increase the water evaporated to formclouds.   Those clouds might reduce the incoming energy by brightening theplanet's surface and reflecting more sunlight back into space,causing a cooling of the Earth.   Yet clouds also are good at trapping infrared radiation headedback into space from Earth. Thus they possibly could raise thesurface temperature instead of cooling it.</TEXT></DOC>
