Microprocessor-controlled optical instruments, initiallydeveloped for HRSR support, are being refined, and new systems to measuretemperatures and gas-seed-slag stream characteristics are being developed.To further data acquisition and analysis capabilities, the diagnosticsystems are being interfaced with MHD Energy Center computers. Additionally,technical support of the diagnostic needs of the national MHD researcheffort is being provided. 9 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
