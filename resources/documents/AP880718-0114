Lloyd Bentsen declared today that Democratshad ``put it all together'' with Jesse Jackson's promise tocampaign for the ticket.   Bentsen, Michael Dukakis' choice for running mate, joined theMassachusetts governor and Jackson for a news conference in whichthe three men spoke of new unity reached in closed-door meetings.   ``There has been a reaching out on both sides,'' said the Texassenator.   He predicted a tough fight in November. ``But with this kind ofunity and the motivational work of Jesse Jackson and the leadershipof Michael Dukakis ... I'm convinced we're going to win a greatvictory in November,'' he said.   Bentsen was making the rounds to state delegations today to woodelegates not yet supporting his addition to the ticket.   At a New Jersey delegation meeting, prior to the joint pressconference, he was greeted with applause but also some Jacksonsigns. Afterward, he went to the Ohio delegation and received awarm welcome _ even though many Ohioans wanted their senator, JohnGlenn, as the vice presidential candidate.   ``I just left a meeting with Governor Dukakis and Jesse Jacksonand we have put it all together,'' he said, to extended cheers.   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste said Bentsen was needed to ``put alittle more shoulder to the wheel in Texas'' and that the Democratswould win Ohio anyway.   Glenn, who was also wished a happy birthday by Bentsen, said``it's going to be a great day when this tall-in-the-saddle Texanright here becomes the vice president of the United States.''   The Texas senator and the Massachusetts governor swept into townSunday for their party's national convention and declared theirpartnership one of mutual admiration.   Making their first joint appearance in the convention city at aparty hosted by Cable News Network, the two men traded accolades.Dukakis called Bentsen ``a man whom I have admired and respectedfor some time.''   Bentsen, who has been candid about differences he has with someof Dukakis' views, beamed and applauded. For his part, Bentsen saidDukakis ``speaks a language we understand in the South'' _ jobs andeducation.   When people ``talk about the electoral vote lock that theRepublicans have on the South, I don't believe that one for aminute,'' Bentsen said. ``We're going to win Georgia and Texas andstate after state across this country.''   Bentsen was greeted at the event by former President JimmyCarter and Georgia's two Democratic senators, Wyche Fowler and SamNunn. Nunn praised the Bentsen choice, saying ``Mike Dukakis willhead a balanced ticket with a broad strength and appeal.''   He said the party was appealing to ``the mainstream Democratswho have long been the anchor of our party, and also mainstreamAmericans.''   Nunn predicted unity among the Democrats that would pay off inNovember with a victory. But a more immediate task for Dukakis andBentsen this week is to resolve problems ranging from dismay amongliberals at a man they see as too conservative to anger amongJackson's supporters that the veteran civil rights activist was notpicked for the No. 2 spot.   In the New Jersey delegation, for example, Assemblyman AlanKarcher said he was ``not happy with Bentsen.''   ``We want to know about his positions,'' he said.   Bentsen on Sunday suggested his position on the ticket wasalready helping Dukakis, apparently referring to a HoustonChronicle-Dallas Morning News poll showing the Democratic tickethad pulled even with the Republicans in Texas.   Another poll, in the Chicago Tribune, indicated that theDukakis-Bentsen ticket led Bush in California, New York andIllinois _ accounting for 107 of the 270 electoral votes needed towin the White House. The survey showed the Democrats running evenor slightly ahead in Bentsen's home state and behind in Florida.</TEXT></DOC>
