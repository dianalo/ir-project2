Since 1984 a total of 31 California Sandamp;Ls have come underreceivership or conservatorship by state or federal regulators,according to the California Department of Savings and Loan.   ``The laws are still there to make it legal to get in trouble,''said state Savings and Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford. ``Idon't know how you insure against it.''   Crawford, who has been urging reform of laws for the industry,sees little progress in that direction.   ``We're still waiting for some college professor to becommissioned to make a study to tell us what to do,'' he said.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board acted against AmericanDiversified Savings Bank and North America Savings and Loan, bothbased in Costa Mesa, Calif.   The action included a rare decision by the board to make straightpayments rather than arranging a takeover by another institution.   A year ago, Crawford testified before a House subcommittee thatfraud was a factor in most of the state's Sandamp;L failures. Members ofthe Consumer and Monetary Affairs subcommittee of the HouseCommittee on Government Operations held hearings because of theextent of savings and loan failures in California.   Crawford testified that deregulation of the industry during theearly 1980s precipitated extensive growth in sometimes risky linesof business and at the same time removed much of the traditionalprotection for depositors.   Both Diversified Savings Bank and North America Savings and Loanwere founded in 1983.   Bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall said the two thrifts had hadfew retail deposits, lacked branch offices, and relied on high-cost,short-term deposits arranged through brokers, which they in turnlent out for speculative real estate ventures and other riskyinvestments.   The cases of the two institutions were similar to another OrangeCounty Sandamp;L, Consolidated Savings Bank of Irvine, which was foundedin 1984 and liquidated in 1986, three months after it was seized byregulators.   American Diversifed and North America Savings were two of sixOrange County savings and loans operating under the Federal Savingsand Loan Insurance Corporation's ``management consignment'' programas of last October.   Crawford, the blunt-spoken Sandamp;L commissioner, offered a simpleexplanation for the clustering in Orange County.   ``There's a lot of affluent people in Orange County. Affluentpeople get charters. Affluent people invest in real estate. Crookslike to get close to money,'' he said.   ``Where would you go? Would you go to South Central Los Angelesto get people to invest in your project? You wouldn't. If you wantto get money you need to locate in Beverly Hills ... or OrangeCounty.''   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. is sending mailgramsto the two Sandamp;Ls' depositors with forms and information they need toclaim their deposits.</TEXT></DOC>
