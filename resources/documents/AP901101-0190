(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The running mate of the Republicangubernatorial candidate who dropped out of the race will not appearon next week's ballot, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled Thursday.   Sharon Clark, nominated in the GOP primary with Jon Grunseth,had asked the court to reverse a decision taking her off the ballotand replacing her with the running mate of Grunseth's replacement.   Grunseth's replacement, Arne Carlson, chose Joanell Dyrstad ashis running mate.   ``They ruled Secretary of State Joan Growe was right, that thedecision to place on the ballot the team of Carlson and Dyrstad wasproper,'' said Chief Deputy Attorney General Jack Tunheim.   Grunseth submitted an affidavit of withdrawal after dropping outof the race Sunday amid allegations he tried to swim nude withteen-age girls at a 1981 party and cheated on both his wives.   Clark did not withdraw, arguing that she had the right to remainon the ballot because she won the support of the Republican Partyand GOP voters in the primary.   ``We're absolutely delighted,'' Carlson said. ``We feel likewe've been through the trials of Job and that has finally come toan end.''   Dyrstad said she and Carlson had always felt like a team. ``Nowwe officially are one,'' she said. ``It's a relief.''   Clark, in a statement read at Grunseth's former campaignheadquarters, thanked the Supreme Court for considering the case.   ``This has been an extraordinary political year full offirsts,'' she said.   To Dyrstad, Clark said, ``I hope you will understand that youand I have been caught in a situation not of our making. I had todo what I felt was right and what I owed the primary voters.''   Clark pledged her support to Carlson.   The ruling delighted Growe, who had decided to take Clark offthe ballot for Tuesday's election. She said she will authorize theprinting Friday of supplemental ballots to reflect the SupremeCourt ruling.   ``Because they acted promptly, Minnesota voters will know whatnames will be on the ballot,'' Growe said. ``It's good to know theSupreme Court agrees with the decisions you make.''   The Supreme Court agreed with Tunheim, who argued that Dyrstadshould be Carlson's running mate because a state constitutionalamendment requires candidates for governor and lieutenant governorin Minnesota to run as a team.</TEXT></DOC>
