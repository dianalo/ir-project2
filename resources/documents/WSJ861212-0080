Inspectors of the federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration say they want to know, among other things, whether the series of industrial accidents are linked in any way with the company's faltering financial position. They are seeking to determine if the company cut safety costs to reduce overall expenditures and whether that might have contributed to the fatalities.    &quot;There's no basis to either confirm or deny that speculation at this point,&quot; says Stanley Elliott, head of OSHA's Pittsburgh regional office, which is heading the investigation. &quot;We're trying to see if there's any correlation between the fatalities. It could be a coincidence. But that would be a pretty big coincidence.&quot;    Local officials of Sharon Steel won't comment. Sharon, based in Sharon, Pa., is a major part of Mr. Posner's Miami-based financial empire.    The deaths are especially puzzling since the plant, which employes 2,500 workers, hasn't recorded a fatality since a suicide eight years ago. &quot;Something has definitely changed in that they've had five fatalities this year,&quot; Mr. Elliott said, adding that until this year, the plant has had a &quot;good safety record.&quot;    Howard Clark, president of the United Steelworkers union local, however, defended the company. &quot;I know it's a company that's strapped for money, but I have to truthfully say that they've worked hard to keep safety up,&quot; says Mr. Clark. &quot;Now, you may not be able to get a pair of safety gloves when you want, but otherwise things are okay.&quot; Mr. Clark adds: &quot;We've been asking questions for seven months now. I just don't know how to explain it to you.&quot;    The latest death apparently occurred last Friday when workers found human bones in a vat of steel in the plant's blastfurnace area. After a hurried head count, workers found that Ernest Buchanan, a 39-year-old county jail inmate on a work-release program, was missing.    &quot;We don't know if it was a suicide or what,&quot; said William Marquis, a sergeant in the Pennsylvania State Police, which is investigating the incident. Officials hope to find out more at a coroner's inquest at the plant this morning.    These are the other four deaths this year, all ruled accidental by local officials:    --George J. Yatsko, 55, was struck by a railroad car at the plant and killed Jan. 22.    --Peter Kovacevic, 61, also was hit by a railroad car, on April 5.    --Willie Frank Phillips, 41, died when he was pinned between a railroad car and a structure in the blast furnace area Oct. 3.    --Paul E. Barlett, 46, was killed two weeks ago when he was hit by a 200-pound hunk of steel.    According to OSHA's Mr. Elliott, the only factor linking any of the deaths is that four occurred in the plant's blast furnace area. &quot;Several parts of the plant are fairly hazardous, including the blast furnace area,&quot; he said.    Sharon is one of the largest pieces of Mr. Posner's troubled empire. The company has said it may be forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection, depending on the outcome of a proposed financial restructuring. Another of Mr. Posner's concerns, Evans Products Co., filed for Chapter 11 protection last year.    Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate with court protection from creditors while it tries to work out a plan to repay its debts. </TEXT></DOC>
