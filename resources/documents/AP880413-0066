The hostages were among 12 freed Tuesday in Larnaca, just hoursbefore the Kuwaiti Airways Boeing 747 left with about 35 otherhostages and six to eight Moslem Shiite hijackers for Algeria,where the plane landed early today.   ``We were not beaten. We were not harassed. They treated us verynicely,'' said Sherif Mahbojh Badrawi said, a Cairo-based ticketingagent for Kuwait Airways. Badrawi and other passengers spoke toreporters in Larnaca General Hospital. Like other freed hostages,he looked tired as he sat on a bed.   ``I didn't see them harming anyone,'' said Badrawi.   ``The only time we felt scared was when we went to the bathroomor wanted a drink because they had pistols pointed at our headwhichever way we went. We were all kept in the center of theplane.''   The hijackers killed two Kuwaiti hostages on Saturday andMonday, dumping their bodies on the Larnaca airport tarmac. Theplane had been at Larnaca for five days.   Mohammed Kamel Sayyid Rehan, a 32-year-old Egyptian who works asa caterer for the airline, also said he and his fellow hostageswere treated well.   He said none of the passengers was aware of the killings.   Rehan was returning from a three-day holiday in Thailand whenthe plane was seized April 5 on a flight from Bangkok, Thailand'scapital, to Kuwait. He asked several times how he could get intouch with his wife and four children.   Most of the 12 passengers freed Tuesday wore pajamas as they sator lay on beds at the hospital, some with intravenous tubes intheir arms.   Dr. George Olympios, who examined the 12, said they appearedhealthy.   ``No one is in a grave condition,'' Olympios said. ``Most are ingood health but are staying for observation; nothing serious apartfrom fatigue.''   ``There were marks on the wrists of most of them,'' apparentlyfrom plastic strips used for binding, he said.   Badrawi and Rehan said they could not give a precise number ofhijackers, but that all were well armed.   ``We saw all kinds of arms,'' Badrawi said. ``They had automaticrifles, grenades, pistols. We always saw them in pairs. I saw sixall together once. They would cover their heads.''   ``We saw many weapons,'' Rehan said. ``I also saw mines.''   Saadi Yousef Quttaineh, a 60-year-old Jordanian who lives inKuwait with his family of six, said: ``I was relaxed all the time,except in the beginning I was a bit afraid.   ``They would move us from one place to another, all together ina group. We received good treatment. We got enough water and food.''   Badrawi described the hijackers as ``good Moslems.''   He said they ``spoke to us in a very Koranic language,'' usingphrases and words common to the Moslem holy book. ``They werealways using verses from the Koran.''</TEXT></DOC>
