The site contains 72 acres of tailings and four of the originalmill buildings. The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978(UMTRCA), Public Law 95-604, authorizes the US Department of Energy toclean up the site to reduce the potential health impacts associated withthe residual radioactive materials remaining at the site and at associatedproperties off the site. The US Environmental Protection Agency promulgatedstandards for the remedial actions (40 CFR 192). Remedial actions mustbe performed in accordance with these standards and with the concurrenceof the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The proposed action is to stabilizethe tailings at their present location by consolidating the tailingsand associated contaminated soils into a recontoured pile. A seven-foot-thickradon barrier would be constructed over the pile and various erosioncontrol measures would be taken to assure the long-term integrity ofthe pile. Three other alternatives which involve moving the tailingsto new locations are assessed in this document. These alternatives whichinvolve moving the tailings to new locations are assessed in this document.These alternatives generally involve greater short-term impacts and aremore costly but would result in the tailings being stabilized in a moreremote location. The no action alternative is also assessed. 99 refs.,40 figs., 58 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
