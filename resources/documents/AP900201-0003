(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Buried in a mountain meadow on theedge of Yellowstone National Park is a complex of 150-foot-longsteel cylinders outfitted with beds, food, kitchens and watersystems for 756 people.   The 30 cylinders are the guts of a giant fallout shelter beingbuilt by the Church Universal and Triumphant, a New Age religiousgroup that moved its international headquarters to thissouthwestern Montana ranch in 1986.   Church members say the six-acre complex isn't provocative orextraordinary, merely a precaution against nuclear war or accident.Others see it as a symbol of church chicanery and disregard for thearea's rural environment.   ``We believe if you live in a nuclear world, you have to come togrips with the reality of our time,'' said Murray Steinman, achurch staffer. ``We feel it's the responsible thing to do. We feelthat more people should do it.''   ``They've never been willing to discuss plans prior toconstruction on anything,'' said Richard Parks, owner of anoutdoor-equipment shop at Gardiner and a frequent critic of churchdevelopments. ``Any responsible developer is going to do theplanning first and then go to the community for approval.''   Church officials didn't divulge its construction until lastsummer _ five months after the state completed an extensiveenvironmental review of other church developments at the CorwinSprings ranch.   ``I think I was had, basically,'' said Steve Pilcher, chief ofthe Water Quality Bureau, which oversaw the review that wascompleted last February.   Church spokeswoman Erin Prophet said that construction began inMay and that a decision on the site wasn't made until after thestate review.   ``I personally think that's a little bit of a crock,'' Pilchersaid. ``You don't decide overnight on a project of this magnitude.''   The church has been scrutinized by the media and its neighborssince buying the 12,500-acre Royal Teton Ranch borderingYellowstone in 1981 from publisher Malcolm Forbes. It has sinceexpanded its holdings in Park County to 30,000 acres, built twofood-processing plants, opened a printing plant in Livingston andsponsored two housing developments for church members nearEmigrant, 25 miles north. It plans another housing development atthe ranch.   Local officials estimate 2,000 church members live in the area,or 15 percent of the county population.   Persistent rumors that the church was stockpiling weaponsagainst some Armageddon were fueled last year when two memberspleaded guilty to charges of illegally obtaining a dozen militaryassault-style weapons; federal agents said they seized a shoppinglist for more firearms. Church officials have denied the rumors,and say the two who bought the guns _ including church VicePresident Edward Francis _ were acting without the knowledge orapproval of the church.   The shelter complex isn't the only church-related undergroundconstruction. Adherents are building private shelters at Emigrant.County officials counted at least 16 under construction there _ onewith a capacity of 170 people. A magazine published by churchmembers carries advertisements selling space in the shelters, withprices ranging from $1,250 to $6,270 a person.   Church leader Elizabeth Clare Prophet has preached civil defensesince the 1970s and warns of economic and nuclear calamity in the'90s. In 1987, she said she received a divine message that thenation should develop civil defense and missile-defense systems inanticipation of a nuclear confrontation.   The confrontation didn't occur by the predicted date of Oct. 2,1989, but followers say her messages are warnings rather thanpredictions.   ``She has said that it may happen ... because there's alwaysfree will,'' says Erin Prophet, Mrs. Prophet's daughter. ``TheAmericans have free will, the Soviets have free will. ... But aslong as the Soviets have nuclear weapons and ICBMs, then we thinkwe need to have shelters.''   The large shelter complex is in a valley where the church holdsan annual conclave attended by thousands of followers. Non-membersare not allowed in the area, which is considered sacred. Churchengineers designed the structure, with advice from private firmsand the federal Oak Ridge National Laboratories. Most of the workhas been done by church staff members.   The complex consists of six H-shaped configurations, each withfive 150-foot-long steel cylinders about 13 feet in diameter. Alarge central structure lies between two of the H-shaped shelters.   Church officials say the shelter's water and sewage systems areexempt from state review because it won't be occupied by more than25 people for more than 60 days a year _ the legal description of a``public water system.''   ``The government says you would only need to be in the falloutshelter for a few weeks'' in the event of a nuclear catastrophe,Steinman said. ``We don't want to live down there any longer thannecessary.''   Critics, including Yellowstone National Park SuperintendentRobert Barbee, scoff at such reasoning and have asked the state toreopen its review. ``What does it take to have (state officials)say, `You can't build an underground city for 750 people withoutthe proper permits?''' Parks fumed.   Pilcher said his office is looking for evidence of deception,but without it the state can't reopen the case. ``The only thing Icould do is say to the church, `I think you're a liar,' but I don'thave anything to prove that.''   Parks and other critics say the construction is indicative ofthe church's pre-emptive methods of development in areas ill-suitedfor it.   Prophet replies that the church has followed the law and doesn'tneed to disclose its plans unless legally required to do so. ``Theydon't really care about the environment,'' she said. ``They careabout stopping us. Basically what they want to do is shut us down.''</TEXT></DOC>
