To compose the soundtrack, he hired Bernard Herrmann, whowould later work with Alfred Hitchcock on ``Vertigo,'' ``North byNorthwest'' and several other films.   But the most important member of the ``Citizen Kane'' crew wascinematographer Gregg Toland, whose credits included ``WutheringHeights'' and ``How Green Is My Valley.'' Toland, anxious for thechance to try out new techniques, had requested to work for Welles.   ``Toland was the single greatest cinematographer of all time,''Wise said. ``He was a master in every way.''   Toland and Welles made extensive use of deep-focus photography,which by putting the entire frame of a picture into focus, allowedseveral points of view to be shown simultaneously. Deep-focus hadbeen used by silent film director D.W. Griffith but was largelydiscontinued in 1925 when a new type of film stock made the effecttechnically unfeasible.   By the late '30s, however, the quality of film had improvedenough to allow again for deep-focus, and Welles and Toland used itto stunning effect.   In one scene, Kane's parents sign an agreement to place youngCharles under the guardianship of Walter Thatcher, a cold-heartedNew York banker. Kane's father is seen at the left side of the frameand his mother is in closeup at the right with Thatcher leaning overher shoulder. In the background, Charles is seen playing outside inthe snow. Because everyone in the frame is shot in focus, the viewercan appreciate how many people are affected by what has taken place.   In another scene, Susan is taking a singing lesson from Matisti,a prominent teacher. The lesson is obviously going badly and Matistiis clearly frustrated by Susan's hopelessly off-key singing.   An increasingly impatient Matisti is seen in the left side of theframe, a clearly uncomfortable Susan sings on the right side, and inthe far background, Kane, in sharp focus, enters the room andangrily advances to the piano. Again, several points of view areexpressed in one frame.   Welles often shot Kane from floor level to make him appear largerand demonstrate his dominance over other people. In one of thefilm's final scenes, when Kane's marraige is rapidly falling apart,Welles uses camera angles to underline the relationship of thecouple. Kane is shot from below as he listens to Susan scream, andis viewed from above when he responds, making him tower over her.The shadow he casts obscures her.   Ceilings had rarely been seen in a Hollywood film until Wellesput them on camera in ``Citizen Kane'' by using extreme up-angleshots.   ``I suppose that closing the top of a set was the real revolutionwe caused,'' Welles once said. ``It's disastrous to let a cameralight a set without a ceiling _ it's artificial.''   Before ``Citizen Kane,'' filmgoers' main exposure to newsreelshad been Hearst's ``March of Time'' clips, which offered hyped-upversions of current events. Because of an intricate technicalprocess, the newsreels in ``Citizen Kane'' had the same ``grainy''look as the Hearst films.   ``What I had to do was take all the film Orson shot and degrainit,'' Wise said. Frank Miller, manager of public relations forSuperStation TBS, said a company to do the coloring has not yet beenhired and could not determine what would be done with the newsreelfootage.   Shooting for ``Citizen Kane'' began in June of 1940 and wascompleted in late October. The film premiered in May 1941 at thePalace Theatre in New York and received rave reviews except frompapers controlled by the outraged Hearst.   ``On seeing it for the first time, one got a conviction that ifthe cinema could do that, it could do anything,'' said film criticPenelope Houston.   Welles' next film, ``The Magnificent Ambersons,'' was reduced byRKO from 131 minutes to 88 minutes after a disastrous screening. By1948, Welles was working for Republic Pictures Corp., whichspecialized in film vehicles for such cowboy stars as Gene Autry andRoy Rogers. He would have only sporadic success the rest of his life.   ``I began at the top and have been making my way down eversince,'' Welles said.   In the mid-1970s, Ralph Weinger, an electronic equipment designerfrom Philadelphia, began experimenting with the process ofconverting black-and-white film to color.   ``The black-and-white film is transferred to one-inchvideotape,'' Weinger said. ``A computer operator picks out keyframes from each individual scene and by using an electronic lightpencil assigns color values to the actors and objects. Then thecomputer takes over and colors all the other frames in the scene.      ``A minute of the scene can be colored in one hour. A 100-minutemovie can be completed in a day and a half.''   The average cost for colorizing a movie is $183,000.   The first job for Weinger's process was the 1978 TV docu-drama,``King.'' Filmways could find no color footage of the 1963 March onWashington to interweave with the dramatized Martin Luther King,Jr., story. Weinger provided four minutes of the March in color.   NBC heard about the process and hired Weinger to color ahalf-hour of World War II newsreels for ``Ike,'' the biography ofDwight D. Eisenhower.   Turner Entertainment issued its first colorized version of aHollywood classic in 1986 with ``Yankee Doodle Dandy.''   ``They go back to the original black-and-white negative and makeit sure it's in the best possible condition. It's then transfrerredto video tape. We never touch the negative,'' said TurnerEntertainment's Miller.   ``The corporation has a team of researchers who study everythingavailable about the film. They talk to people around at the time.They also study the styles of Technicolor of the period. Theirresearch is pretty exhaustive.''   The colorization of films has also meant that high-quality printsfor the black-and-white versions are now available. In February, NewYork's Biograph Theatre, a leading revival house, will be starting a``Tribute to Turner Entertainment,'' showing brand new prints of``Citizen Kane'' and ``Casablanca'' among others.   ``The Turner people are very good, first class,'' said FrankRowley, program director of the Biograph. ``I play the pictures asthey're meant to be played.''   For Welles, who was working on an adaptation of ``King Lear'' atthe time of his death, films were meant to played inblack-and-white. Leaming recalled that even in the '80s, he had anaversion to filming in color.   ``He knew that the pressure of the market became too strong, thatpeople wanted color films,'' Leaming said. ``He would say, `I'll puta color prolog on `King Lear' and fool them. They'll give me themoney and then I'll shoot it in black-and-white the way it shouldbe.'''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE></DOC>
