The computer, called a file server, is intended to linkmany more users, for example in a large company or governmentagency, to a central relational database, one that linksdifferent sets of data together, in effect replacing morecostly mainframe machines. Sequent said its new machine, theSequent Information Server, expands the potential number ofusers by using multiple processors and a version of Novell'sNetWare communications software that has been modified totake advantage of multiprocessing.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is the cutting edge of client-server thinking,&quot; saidCasey Powell, Sequent's chairman. &quot;Until now, client-servercomputing has been focused on the workgroup level, with verylittle access to corporate mainframe data.&quot;   The modified NetWare isn't proprietary and will be madeavailable by Novell to Sequent's competitors such asInternational Business Machines Corp., Digital EquipmentCorp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. But a Sequent spokesman saidthat Sequent has a lead of at least a year because its fileserver has been designed to fit with the modified NetWare andwill be shipped by January. Prices will range from $25,000 to$2.5 million, depending on the size of the system.   Yesterday, in national over-the-counter trading, Sequent'sstock closed at $11.625 a share, down 12.5 cents, whileNovell closed at $40.75 a share, up 62.5 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
