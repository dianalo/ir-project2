Lawyers for the Ohio Department of Commerce in Columbus saidFriday they had reached an out-of-court settlement with ArthurAnderson andamp; Co. lawyers.   Ohio Court of Claims Judge John Donnelly ordered both sides toremain silent on the details of the settlement until it was filedwith Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Richard Niehaus.   David Phillips, former managing partner of Arthur Andersen inCincinnati, said the proposed settlement ``was substantially lessthan the cost of the defense,'' but declined to give the amount.   Connie Harris, head of the Ohio Department of Commerce andformer superintendent of the department's savings and loansdivision, had sued Arthur Andersen to recover some of the $275million in tax money used to protect depositors after Home Statecollapsed in March 1985.   The state claimed Andersen partly was responsible for the lossesbecause it was auditor of Home State, which had overinvested fundsin ESM Government Securities Inc. of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., whichlater collapsd.   Andersen's audits did not find anything wrong with Home State'sfinances or investments.   Andersen maintained it had no way of knowing ESM was afraudulent operation that had provided Home State and its auditorswith phony financial statements. The company also said stateofficials did not adequately regulate Home State and did not act onwarnings about the ESM investments.   The proposed settlement, reached Friday in Columbus, must beapproved by Niehaus, who is Home State's liquidator.   The settlement ended the second of the state's three major HomeState-related claims, said Fred Alverson, a Commerce Departmentspokesman. The state already has negotiated a $70 millionsettlement with Grant-Thornton, formerly known as Alexander Grant,which was ESM's accounting firm.   A civil suit is pending against former Home State owner MarvinWarner, who is appealing his conviction on criminal chargesstemming from the thrift's failure.   Niehaus has ordered Warner to pay $22 million in restitution tothe state as part of his criminal sentence.</TEXT></DOC>
