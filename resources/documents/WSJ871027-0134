Within a few years, the technique may be used with farm animals such as goats or cows, providing a cheaper way to make TPA and some other genetically engineered drugs, the researchers said.    Such drugs now are produced with genetically altered single cells grown inside intricate systems of vats, tubes and solutions that resemble miniature oil refineries. By producing drugs in animals' milk, scientists might replace much of this complex machinery with stalls and hay. &quot;Eventually, we might be able to produce the entire world supply of TPA with a herd of 100 cows,&quot; said an NIH spokesman.    The work, announced yesterday at a news conference in Washington, was performed by NIH scientists using genetic material for TPA provided by Integrated Genetics Inc., a Framingham, Mass.-based biotechnology concern. TPA, regarded as biotechnology's first potential blockbuster product, is an experimental drug that dissolves blood clots that cause heart attacks.    The research was based on techniques developed during the past few years for making &quot;transgenic&quot; animals -- ones in which genes from different species have been implanted. Using the techniques, scientists are trying to produce improved farm animals, such as pigs that yield leaner meat than ordinary ones.    The NIH group said its finding represents the first published report showing the production of an active human drug in a transgenic animal's milk. The report is scheduled for publication in the November issue of the journal Bio/Technology. Another research group in Scotland recently reported that it induced production of a sheep protein in the milk of transgenic mice. That group also is trying to produce human proteins, intended for use as drugs, in sheep milk.    The NIH scientists said that they combined TPA genes with genetic material that regulates production of a protein found in mouse milk. The combination, injected into mouse embryos, was activated to produce and secrete TPA in the mammary glands of mice but not in their other tissues. The process didn't hurt the animals, the researchers added.    The commercial production of genetically engineered substances in animals' milk will require overcoming several problems, including the implantation of desired genes in animals that produce large amounts of milk. Another problem that must be overcome is purifying drugs secreted in the milk.    Furthermore, the process will have to compete with usual production methods that, although technologically complicated, may be cheaper for many drugs. The most probable candidates for production in milk are certain complex proteins, such as TPA, that are particularly expensive and tricky to make with cell-culture methods, said Robert Carpenter, Integrated Genetics' president and chief executive officer. </TEXT></DOC>
