The rogue computer program, designed to sabotage a privatecompany in Dallas, destroyed computer files over a five-monthperiod beginning in January, the newspaper said.   Damage to government data was limited, but files were destroyed,projects were delayed and hundreds of hours were spent tracking theelectronic culprit, the Times said.   It was not known whether the program was deliberately introducedor brought in accidentally, but National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration officials have asked the FBI to investigate, thepaper said.   Also affected were the Environmental Protection Agency, theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S.Sentencing Commission, the Times said.   The program ``infected'' close to 100 computers at NASAfacilities in Washington, Maryland and Florida, NASA officials said.   Viruses are computer programs that can lie dormant until theyare set off, wiping out files or having other effects. Some virusesare not activated until a particular time or until another programis run.   The loss of information was isolated and limited to personalcomputers, rather than larger mainframes, according to DavidLavery, a senior computer systems scientist with NASA.   The virus was designed to sabotage computer programs atElectronic Data Systems in Dallas, said company spokesman BillWright. The program did little damage, he said.   The Times said it was not known how the program spread from thecompany to personal computers, but some government officialssuspect the virus was spread through informal networks ofgovernment computer users who exchange publicly available software.   The spread of the virus worsened when private contractors inWashington and North Carolina inadvertently sold dozens ofcomputers carrying the virus to government agencies, the newspapersaid.   Private computer consultants have warned that governmentcomputer networks, inlcuding those with national securityfunctions, are vulnerable.   ``I would hate to be an astronaut and have that virus exposeitself two years down the line,'' said a computer systems analystwith the General Services Administration who requested anonymity.The agency manages contracts for the government.</TEXT></DOC>
