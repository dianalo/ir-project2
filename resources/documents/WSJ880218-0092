The financial services concern said it will take a $93 million after-tax charge in the third quarter ending March 31 to bolster its reserves against further foreclosure losses and to cover the cost of cutting back the mortgage operations.    The charge also includes a $5 million pretax charge for the cost of eliminating its small Dallas home-building operations.    The unit's difficulties reflect the problems faced by mortgage bankers nationwide. Mortgage commitments are expected to fall to $325 billion in 1988, compared with $425 billion last year. In addition, an unusually large number of properties in foreclosure, largely in Southwest real estate markets, continue to generate significant losses.    &quot;We are a microcosm of the mortgage banking industry,&quot; said Jess Hay, Lomas's chairman and chief executive officer.    As previously reported, SMR Research Corp., a Budd Lake, N.J., mortgage research firm, predicts that as many as 500 mortgage lenders will disappear through mergers or bankruptcy this year.    Lomas, the nation's largest independent mortgage banker, said it expects to show a net loss of $69 million for the nine months ending March 31, compared with earnings of $26.9 million, or 90 cents a share, in the fiscal 1987 nine months. For the year ending June 30, the company projects a loss of $55 million, compared with earnings in fiscal 1987 of $45.4 million, or $1.49 a share.    In restructuring its mortgage unit, the company expects to close as many as 40 of its 60 mortgage offices and reduce the unit's work force to about 2,150 employees, down from a peak in 1987 of 3,600.    Last summer, Lomas also laid off about 800 workers and closed 45 offices, blaming sharp declines in housing sales and the number of mortgage refinancings in 1987.    Lomas's mortgage-banking woes prompted an aggressive diversification program in the past two years, as the company added retail banking, credit card, leasing and insurance operations to reduce its reliance on mortgage lending.    Including the latest addition to reserves, Lomas since last April has set aside about $109.5 million to cover foreclosure losses.    Nancy Young, an analyst with Tucker, Anthony andamp; R.L. Day, New York, said Lomas was forced to take the charges over the past year because of a decline in government support to housing, particularly for loans insured by the Veterans Administration.    Since 1986, the number of VA-insured loans that have been turned back to lenders in foreclosure proceedings more than tripled, leaving loan issuers such as Lomas to sell off the real estate. In the past 12 months, Ms. Young said, Lomas has written off or provided reserves for almost 2% of its VA loans. &quot;By any historical standard, that is massive,&quot; she said.    Because of uncertainty about future defaults, Ms. Young said, further provisions of as much as $30 million next year are possible. The company and other analysts disagree. &quot;The size of this reserve is so great, I would be surprised&quot; if Lomas has to provide reserves for further problem loans, said David Hochstin, with Shearson Lehman Hutton in San Francisco.    The company said it intends to maintain its quarterly dividend of 35 cents a share despite the projected fiscal 1988 loss.    In heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lomas closed at $16.625, down $1.125. </TEXT></DOC>
