In effect, GM plans to piggy back on EDS's record profitsand market success to subsidize its stumbling core NorthAmerican auto operations.</LP><TEXT>   GM announced its third equity offering in seven months inthe middle of a mini-rally in stocks of the Big Three automakers yesterday. While it isn't clear whether the currentwave of &quot;buy American&quot; sentiment will result in long-termgains for the U.S. car makers, the movement comes at a timewhen many investors have concluded the worst is over forDetroit.   Chrysler shares jumped $1.50 to $15 in late New York StockExchange composite trading yesterday on positive comments byanalysts about the company's new models. GM shares werequoted at $34.125, up $1.375, and Ford shares rose $1 to$32.75 in late Big Board trading.   But GM's latest offering indicates that the auto makerstill has a long way to go to repair its battered balancesheet. GM now has applied to the Securities and ExchangeCommission for permission to sell stock valued at a combined$2.5 billion in issues aimed at a variety of differentinvestors. But that may not be enough to offset the company'sexpected losses for all of 1991, which analysts estimate willbe as high as $2.9 billion.   GM has launched a wide-ranging cost-reduction andrestructuring effort in a push to get back in the black thisyear. The company plans to shed 74,000 jobs and close 21factories in the next three years. One of those plants, a GMspokesman said yesterday, will be the so-called &quot;factory ofthe future&quot; in Saginaw, Mich. The plant, in which virtuallyall production was done by robots, was a symbol of GM's rushto automation in the 1980s. But the parts built at theautomated plant cost more than those built elsewhere, a GMspokesman said. Such cost-cutting won't yield resultsimmediately, however, and GM needs cash to avoid furtherdelays in new product programs.   &quot;There's no question that GM is at the worst point in itscash-flow cycle,&quot; said Dean Witter Reynolds analyst Ronald A.Glantz. &quot;With stocks high and interest rates low, this is agood time to raise money this way.&quot;   In the registration filed yesterday with the SEC, GM saidit plans to sell 15 million depositary shares priced $50apiece. The company would also have an option to sell anadditional 2.25 million shares to the underwriters of theissue. The yield on the depositary shares hasn't been set,but analysts expect it will be competitive with Ford's 8.4%yield on its recently issued convertible preferred. Fordraised $2.3 billion in November in a single preferred stockoffering that was the largest such offering ever by a U.S.company.   GM said the money raised by its latest offering will beused for the company's general corporate purposes, althoughthe underlying common stock is that of its data processingsubsidiary, EDS.   Provisions for converting new Class C shares into GM ClassE common shares tied to EDS, including the conversionpremium, won't be determined until the time of offering. ButGM officials said converting the new depositary shares intoshares of Class E common stock wouldn't dilute EDS's earningsper share.   About 41% of the 239 million Class E shares areoutstanding and the remaining 59% of the shares are held bythe company. The company said it would not create any newClass E shares for the converted shares, but would merelyshift shares held by the company to the public.   GM Class E shares represent a dividend interest in EDS'sperformance. They don't confer an ownership interest in EDS.   Industry analysts said the new GM securities, expected toyield about 7%, should be attractive in a climate wherecertificates of deposit are paying yields well below 6%.   &quot;The market seems to have an appetite for auto-relatedissues,&quot; said Maryann Keller, auto analyst at Furmen SelzInc. &quot;You can't get anything worth troubling about in CD's.That's the reason why deals like this are coming and arequite successful.&quot;   GM's Class E shares have soared 28% to $57.50 yesterdayfrom $45 a year ago. But GM's common share is down 6% from ahigh of $36.25 a year ago.   &quot;The Class E common is on a roll,&quot; a GM spokesman said.&quot;The Class E common is more attractive than the GM commonshares because it's experiencing more of a steady rise. TheGM common is a cyclical stock.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
