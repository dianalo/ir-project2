The envoy, Albert Hohl, said he spent a ``boisterous evening''with city officials from Bonn and from Basel, Switzerland, on aRhine River cruise boat.   He said that in joking about Swiss relations with the bigneighbor to the north, he mentioned an anti-German epithet. TheWest Germans did not take offense but the Basel delegation latercomplained to the Foreign Ministry, Hohl told The Associated Press.   He dismissed a report Wednesday by a Basel magazine, Dementi,that he insulted the German group and had to be dragged from theboat drunk.   Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman Clemens Birrer said an internalinquiry was launched against Hohl after the Sept. 23 incident, inwhich the ambassador was ``under a certain degree of alcoholinfluence.'' Hohl has been asked to respond officially to theallegations of poor conduct, the spokesman said.   While official relations between the two countries are good,opinion polls traditionally show that West Germans are not verypopular in Switzerland.</TEXT></DOC>
