The San Diego-based company said its approximately 4,000 customer accounts were transferred to Thomas Green as of Tuesday morning. The concern's three offices and 30 brokers are operating as a unit of Thomas Green.    Michael Collins, president of San Diego Securities, said the concern had losses mainly because customers failed to meet margin calls. Margin is the amount of cash that must be put up in the purchase of a security; the buyer can borrow the rest.    Mr. Collins, who will become president of the new unit of Thomas Green, said some of San Diego Securities' market-making activities in about 15 stocks will be assumed by Thomas Green, but others will be dropped.    Officials of both companies declined to disclose how much Thomas Green will pay for the assets it is buying from San Diego Securities. They said final terms haven't been set.    Thomas Green, which was known as Merrill Luther, Kalis andamp; Co. until last March, had about 3,000 accounts, two offices and 19 brokers before the switch. Jose A. Arvizu, Thomas Green's chief financial officer, said the assets of San Diego Securities will expand the company's retail client base and add offices in the San Diego area. He said the concern previously made markets in 23 over-the-counter stocks. </TEXT></DOC>
