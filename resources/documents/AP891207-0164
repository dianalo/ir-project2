The assembly passed by a 91-2 margin the Nicaraguan-sponsoredresolution against the U.S-backed Contras, who were to be disbandedthis week under a regional peace plan. It asked Washington to obeya 1986 judgment by the International Court of Justice ordering itto halt support for the Contras.   Only the United States and Israel voted against the measure. The41 abstentions included most of the U.S. allies in Europe and theCaribbean. Honduras, where an estimated 11,000 Contra forces areheadquartered in jungle camps along the Nicaraguan border, alsoabstained.   In a separate action, the General Assembly decided by consensusto approve spending up to $40.8 million over six months to send a650-member border patrol force to Central America.   The peacekeeping force is intended to deter cross-border raidsby the Contras or any other insurgents and to cut offweapons-smuggling.   The United States accuses Nicaragua and Cuba of shipping weaponsto leftist rebels battling El Salvador's government, and theContras have acknowledged they are selling weapons to theSalvadoran rebels.   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told the assembly that theWorld Court's ruling was one-sided, ignoring U.S. support for theCentral American peace process.   The United States had said it not believe the world court, basedin the Netherlands and serving as the U.N.'s judicial arm, couldrule on national security issues.   The court's 15 judges ruled Washington had disobeyedinternational law by interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairswith its support for the Contras. The court has no power to enforceits judgments, however.   U.S. military aid to the Contras ended two years ago, Pickeringsaid, and only non-lethal aid is sent to the rebels.   By contrast, he said, ``Nicaragua's military assistance to theEl Salvador insurgents has again been revealed in the recent planecrash at El Transito in El Salvador, which revealed weaponsdestined for the El Salvador guerrillas.''   Two dozen Soviet-made SAM-7 anti-aircraft missile launchers werefound in the wreckage of that light plane, which crashed Nov. 25.   Nicaraguan Ambassador Alejandro Serrano Caldera said U.S.``aggression'' against Nicaragua continues today. He said U.S.non-lethal aid to the Contras is actually logistical help in thewar.   In addition, Serrano Caldera said U.S. meddling in Nicaragua'sinternal affairs continued when the U.S. Congress appropriated $9million for the opposition in national elections set for Feb. 25.   Under an agreement signed by Central American presidents, theContras were to be dismantled voluntarily by last Tuesday. However,neither the rebels nor the United States were part of that accord.   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua has proposed extending thedeadline to the end of the month. The region's presidents aremeeting again Sunday in Costa Rica to take up the issue.</TEXT></DOC>
