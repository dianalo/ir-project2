by electing to update the operating systems of perfectly runningmachines.andP;  In the final analysis, the upgrade fever epidemics of 1990 mayqualify for a slot in Guinness as the largest game of Trivial Pursuit onrecord.andM;The gestalts surrounding the introductions of MS-DOS 5.0 and Macintosh System7.0 were as different as Laurel and Hardy, and almost as laughable.andP;  Afterthree years priming the PR pump with System 7.0 hype, Apple strategistsproceeded on the assumption that the overall noise level could effectivelycompensate for being 14 months behind schedule and failing to deliver asignificant number of previously announced features.andM;Despite all of last year's hyperkinetic Windows fervor, the Microsoft mobchose a decidedly low-key launch of MS-DOS 5.0 on a laid-back yacht cruise ofthe Hudson.andM;According to Redmond residents in a position to know, Gates and companydecided to keep the DOS 5.0 hoopla to a minimum, so as not to disturb theconcentration of Federal Trade Commission investigators as they tiptoedthrough Microsoft's internal records.andP;  If the FTC boys were startled intolooking up from the business at hand, they might have noticed the corpse ofDigital Research's DR DOS 5.0 lying in the campus bushes.andM;System 7.0 had MS-DOS 5.0 beat hands down in the critical &quot;disks per dollar&quot;category.andP;  While both sport a $100 retail price, the Apple upgrade involves10 disks.andP;  Before you jump to the conclusion that DOS 5.0 installation istherefore speedier, be assured that Microsoft has addressed the issue byloading the DOS 5.0 disks with &quot;squeezed&quot; files which insure thatinstallation is more tedious than a Supreme Court nominee confirmation.andM;Although it continued to sanction the free distribution of the new Mac OSsoftware by user groups, information services, and your Uncle Irv, Apple keptthe street price of the &quot;official&quot; upgrade package artificially high by&quot;underestimating demand for the complete package&quot; (i.e., constrainingsupply).andP;  Those who wanted docs as well as software usually had to cough up ahundred bucks, whether they were dealing direct or locally.andM;The Egghead Software chain undercut the MS-DOS 5.0 market by offering a $20instant rebate out of the chute on an already heavily discounted price.andO;Heck, even this cheapskate popped for the upgrade package at the scrambledEgg's forty-buck enduser cost.andP;  I took exception, however, at thesalesperson's insistence that I needed a third-party book on using DOS 5.0.andO;After all, I was getting the original &quot;docs.&quot;andM;Big mistake.andM;It took only a couple of hours of leafing through the User's Guide andReference to come to the conclusion that Microsoft has been recruiting itsdocumentation writers from the Cryptography Bureau of the National SecurityAgency.andP;  IF anyone out there manages to find clear and cogent instructions inthe &quot;Optimizing Your System&quot; chapter, let me know if the medication you're onis available over the counter.andM;Over the years, Apple's major system software releases have managed tomaintain a lock on the covered &quot;lack of upward compatibility&quot; title.andP;  Inanswer to critics who have been rude enough to make silly things likeportability of older applications an issue, Apple has come up with a System7.0 Compatibility Checker (a.k.a.andP;  the Wallet Checker).andP;  According to theCompatibility Checker, 19 of my applications fell into the &quot;Must Upgrade&quot;(all bets are off) category and another hundred or so qualified for the&quot;Guess What?&quot; genre.andM;I willfully suspended my usual disbelief for the moment and took the System7.0 plunge.andP;  Installation was uneventful, and a mere 10 minutes latter I hada Macintosh IIfx that locked up tighter than John Sununu's travel budget atthe end of the boot process.andP;  It took only a couple of hours to track theproblem down to a conflict between Apple's DAL (Dump Arlan andamp; Lockup) INIT formainframe access and Suitcase II.andM;Before installing System 7.0 on my Mac, I thought that balloon help wassomething my 5-year-old needed occasionally.andP;  After test driving 7.0 for amonth, that opinion remains essentially unchanged.andP;  Maybe if there were anoption that changed those cute pop-up help balloons into funny animal shapesafter a few seconds, I would find the feature less irritating than a hearrash.andM;Mac users need not feel left out when it comes to the hard disk tapdanceproduction numbers, since System 7.0 adds support for virtual memory.andP;  Backwhen 7.0 was on the drawing board and RAM was $250 per megabyte, a case couldbe made for virtual memory.andP;  With real memory prices down to $35 per megthese days, virtual memory makes as much sense as most of this country's &quot;NoRight Turn On Red&quot; traffic signs.andM;Is There a Guillotine in the House?andM;Meanwhile, back at the PC ranch, MS-DOS 5.0 was less problematic in terms ofcompatibilty with existing applications.andP;  I couldn't find a single program onmy 160Mb of online storage that refused to waltz with 5.0.andP;  I'm told thatsome programs that check for DOS version numbers get confused, but those canusually be hornswoggled into thinking they're running on a lower version ofMS-DOS by using the SETVER command.andM;Like DR DOS 5.0, MS-DOS can load much of itself above the 640K line, or IntelTwiight Zone.andP;  According to the manual, the additional conventional memorythat this frees &quot;makes your MS-DOS programs run faster and more efficiently.&quot;andO;Either the doc authors are taking enough license to be appointed PC poetlaureates or they have a better source of drugs than Manuel Noriega.andP;  Thelatter may account for the downright bizarre behavior of device drivers andTSRs I attempt to LOADHIGH and DEVICEHIGH.andM;Some of the more radical MS-DOS 5.0 changes include a full-screen editor thathas all the charm of an early release of WordStar, and a serviceable DOSshell that mercifully puts a bullet into the head of MS-DOS 4.0's lame filemanager.andP;  The new DOSSHELL even includes a task switcher that can be used tostart up multiple applications and flip between them by swapping theiraddress spaces to and from the hard disk.andM;Surprisingly enough, this markedly improves Windows 3.0's performance.andP;  Aftera half-hour of using the DOS shell switcher, Windows task switching feelslike Warp 10.andM;Lest one might jump to the conclusion that I don't have anything positive tosay about MS-DOS 5.0, let's set the record straight: Microsoft has trulyoutdone itself in one critical area--the multicolored hologram stickers thatassure me that I purchased a &quot;genuine Microsoft MS-DOS operating system&quot; area Billy Bob Gates exclusive.andP;  In fact, when I peeled one off the manual'sspine and affixed it to my machine's case, I immediate noticed that my MS-DOSprograms ran faster and more efficiently.andM;Arlan Levitan has been making life a living hell for computer magazineeditors since 1981.andP;  When he is not competing with Third-World debtors of theWorld Bank for rights to Guinness' coveted &quot;missed deadlines&quot; title, hedabbles in RISC chip mask development.andP;  Arlan can be found on CompuServe at70675,463.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
