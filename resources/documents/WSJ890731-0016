Foreign ministers from the U.S., the Soviet Union and 18 other countries opened the conference with a call for a comprehensive peace accord in the Southeast Asian nation's 20-year-old conflict. The warring parties, however, stuck to their positions. Prince Sihanouk reiterated his call for a four-party interim government following a withdrawal by Vietnam. Secretary of State Baker warned that U.S. aid to a new Phnom Penh government would depend on the role of the Khmer Rouge guerrillas.    Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, at talks Saturday in Paris, agreed to meet in September to prepare for a Bush-Gorbachev summit.    ---   MOSLEM CAPTORS VOWED to kill a U.S. hostage over a cleric's abduction.    A Shiite group threatened to hang today Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins unless Israel frees a Moslem clergyman kidnapped Friday by Israeli commandos. The cleric is a leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah group. The U.S. called the threat &quot;outrageous,&quot; and said the kidnappers would be responsible for the safety of Higgins, head of a U.N. peacekeeping force who was abducted in southern Lebanon in February 1988. Israel was expected to try to exchange the cleric for three soldiers missing in Lebanon.    An official in Jerusalem said Washington has asked Israel to report what it discovered during the interrogation of the abducted Moslem cleric.    ---   A Soviet parliamentary faction elected Yeltsin, Sakharov and three others to lead the nearly 400-member group, Moscow's first organized opposition in nearly 70 years. The faction is pressing to accelerate Gorbachev's restructuring program. Separately, official Soviet newspapers expressed concern that rail strikes could erupt.    ---   Poland's Rakowski faces the task of rebuilding the country's Communist Party amid criticism of the government's economic management over the past year. The 62-year-old Rakowski, who is expected to resign as prime minister today, was named party chief Saturday, succeeding President Jaruzelski, who resigned the post. The Warsaw government announced the end of food price controls and meat rationing, despite warnings from the Solidarity union and a Politburo member that the move could lead to huge price increases and unrest. The plan takes effect tomorrow.    ---   Rafsanjani won an expected landslide in Iran's presidential election, with final results showing him capturing almost 95% of the ballots cast Friday. Voters also approved amendments strengthening the presidency. But a massive turnout sought by Tehran's leaders as a sign of support for the Islamic revolution didn't materialize.    ---   Israel's high court restricted the army's right to demolish the homes of Palestinians suspected of involvement in the 19-month-old uprising in the occupied territories. The court said the military must allow judicial appeals. More than 200 houses have been destroyed, and the practice has been denounced by the U.S. and other nations.    ---   China's Communist leadership approved measures to combat graft. While the steps cleared Friday at a Politburo meeting were considered a response to a major demand of this spring's student-led protests, the measures apparently lack detail and specific legal sanction.    ---   The Exxon Valdez tanker entered San Diego Bay, arriving at a shipyard for long-delayed repairs after running aground March 24 and spilling crude oil into Alaska's waters. The repair job is expected to cost $25 million.    ---   A former regional HUD official made decisions that benefited private developers who became his business partners after he left the federal housing agency. The disclosure came in testimony Friday from Joseph Monticciolo, the agency's New York administrator from 1981 through 1988, before a House panel.    ---   Chileans voted in a referendum on constitutional changes to ease a transition to democracy, including legalizing Marxism and reducing presidential power. Partial returns showed the measures, backed by Pinochet and the opposition, headed for approval.    ---   Arab League officials neared completion of proposals aimed at ending the 14-year-old civil war in Lebanon, where a lull in fighting enabled hundreds of people to flee Beirut. Over the weekend, Syrian-backed militiamen and Christian forces traded rocket fire, hitting every neighborhood in both sectors of the capital and some outlying villages.    ---   Rep. Dixon of California said he was never lobbied by a company with which his wife has a lucrative business arrangement. But the company's law firm, in documents filed with the Justice Department, said it contacted the Ethics Committee chairman on company business four times in 1986 and 1987. Dixon termed the data &quot;erroneous.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
