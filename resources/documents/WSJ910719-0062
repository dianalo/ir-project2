The Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agencysaid it made contact with the satellites Wednesday nightafter they passed over a control station near Washington. Theagency had lost contact with the satellites after OrbitalSciences' Pegasus rocket apparently had a mishap when thefirst stage of the four-stage rocket separated.</LP><TEXT>   The Pentagon announcement saves Orbital Sciences, based inFairfax, Va., from what could have been a disastrous setback.But the company and the Pentagon agency still need todetermine what went wrong with the launch. Orbital Sciencesofficials called the flight a success because the rocket'sguidance system compensated for the mishap and was able toplace the satellites in orbit.   The Pentagon agency said the 49-pound satellites, eachabout the size of an automobile tire, were supposed to havebeen placed in a circular orbit about 447 miles from theEarth. Instead, the rocket placed them in an elliptical orbit282 miles by 221 miles. The Pentagon said it could still usethe so-called microsats in experiments in battlefieldcommunications.</TEXT></DOC>
