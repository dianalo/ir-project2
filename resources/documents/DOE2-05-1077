Deforestation in the tropicsaccounted for nearly all of the flux; the net release of carbon fromtemperate and boreal regions was only 0.1 x 10/sup 15/ g C. The averageglobal value of 1.8 x 10/sup 15/ g C in 1980 was distributed geographicallyamong tropical countries and other region on the basis of deforestationrates and carbon stocks. The net release of carbon from changes in landuse worldwide is inconsistent with the results of geochemical modelsof the carbon cycle. The discrepancy is smaller than in previous analyses,but is large enough to exceed the error of the analysis. Possible explanationsfor the discrepancy include the possibility of a net accumulation ofcarbon in undisturbed ecosystems as a result of CO/sub 2/ fertilizationor changes in climate. Even if the terms of the global carbon equationwere to appear balanced at present, current knowledge is insufficientto predict whether terrestrial ecosystems will act as a positive or negativefeedback on the anticipated CO/sub 2/-caused global warming.
