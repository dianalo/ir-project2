According to conventional wisdom, international crises aresupposed to send gold prices skyrocketing. In theory,investors pull their money out of what they perceive as shakypaper assets and buy gold, a universally accepted currencythat has survived as a store of value through centuries ofpolitical and economic upheaval.</LP><TEXT>   But twice this year alone, gold has failed to rise duringinternational disturbances. Prices barely budged when news ofthe Soviet coup attempt broke last Monday. And at the startof the Persian Gulf War in January, prices rose only for anhour or two and then plunged nearly $30 an ounce.   If wars and military coups involving the world'ssuperpowers can't push gold prices up, what will? The answerseems to be a different set of economic circumstances.   Gold &quot;is no longer the preferred asset for `hot money,'&quot;says Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metalsin Boca Raton, Fla. More-sophisticated investors havediscovered other ways to hedge themselves against crisis,such as buying U.S. dollar-denominated assets.   That is what happened last Monday. Jittery investors,particularly in Europe, sought the stability of the U.S. bybuying dollars, said August Arace, co-portfolio manager ofthe Freedom Gold andamp; Government Trust.   Much of the activity in currencies reflects money movingacross national boundaries to buy government securities, suchas U.S. Treasury bonds. Besides being perceived as safe,these instruments pay interest.   Gold, instead, just sits there, and nowadays it can'tcompete with financial instruments paying interest, Mr. Aracesays. Mr. Nichols adds that because gold pays no return,investors who turn to it incur an &quot;opportunity cost,&quot; whichthey can escape by buying interest-bearing securities.   Gold does well when rising inflation reduces the &quot;real&quot;interest rates paid by securities, Mr. Arace says. During the1970s, for example, inflation grew so fast that &quot;real&quot;interest rates became negative, he says.   These days, though, inflation is declining and realinterest rates are on the high side, historically. That iswhy gold is an unattractive investment, says Mr. Arace, whosays he has been a gold bear for 11 years.   But Joseph Rosta, an analyst with CPM Group, a New Yorkconsulting concern, thinks crises still boost gold prices,but the last two just weren't bad enough to scare people. InJanuary, the allied attack on Iraq was swift and forceful, hesays, which calmed Middle East investors sufficiently so thatthey didn't swarm into gold. Last week, people weren't surethe coup attempt would succeed, he says. Their wait-and-seeattitude wasn't conducive to panicky gold-buying.   Tom Griffo, precious metals analyst at Cargill InvestorsServices in New York, also argues that gold hasn't performedall that poorly. &quot;Between October and January, as the GulfWar preparations got under way, gold rallied $40,&quot; Mr. Griffosays. &quot;I thought that impressive.&quot;   Overwrought expectations are part of the problems, headds. Whenever &quot;someone fires a gun somewhere, investors lookfor $800-an-ounce gold.&quot;   Mr. Griffo believes that continuing unrest within theSoviet Union and continuing problems in Eastern Europe willsend many European investors -- particularly Germans -- backinto gold. &quot;Because they are so close to the Soviet Union,they will feel the need for the security that gold canoffer,&quot; he says.   Gold is &quot;still an insurance policy against disaster, butthe people who want that kind of insurance now own it,&quot; saysMr. Nichols. &quot;People don't run out and buy additionalinsurance all the time.&quot;   Selling by gold producers -- or fears of it -- haveswamped what flight-to-safety buying emerged during thisyear's crises, analysts say. On Monday, prices rose brieflyovernight, but then retreated quickly on worries that theSoviet Union would sell gold to raise hard currency ifWestern nations withheld economic aid to the hard-lineregime. Producer selling also was blamed for capping aninitial price rise the night the Persian Gulf war started.   Producer selling is expected to continue to stymie futuregold rallies. In addition, some central banks are selling thegold they hold in their reserves. Since 1981, Canada hasreduced its gold reserves by 6.9 million ounces to 14.1million. Belgium sold 3.3 million ounces in 1989. Hungaryreduced gold holdings by 1.2 million ounces, or 80% of itstotal bullion holdings, last year, and Czechoslovakiadisposed of 1.1 million ounces, representing a 30% decline inits gold reserves, according to the Bank for InternationalSettlements.   More important than outright gold sales are other methodscentral banks are using to put their gold reserves to work,such as gold loans and swaps for foreign exchange. If centralbanks weren't so active in lending out their gold, he says,prices might be higher.   The gold held as collateral in Soviet currency swaps isparticularly worrisome to some traders, who are concernedthat the country's declining credit-worthiness could pushsome of that gold onto the market, driving gold prices lower.   Despite all this, gold bulls remain firm in theirpredictions that gold prices will rise. Michael Aronstein,president of Comstock Partners, says gold's recentperformance hasn't altered his firm's bullish position on themetal. &quot;These kinds of events don't affect our thinking,&quot; hesays. &quot;The safe-haven notion isn't one of the underlyingrationales for our owning it.&quot;   Comstock sees the shakeout in the U.S. financial systemspreading, leading investors to seek alternatives to paperassets. Comstock manages Dreyfus Capital Value Fund andComstock Partners Strategy Fund.   &quot;Gold will have its day,&quot; says Peter Borish, director ofresearch for Tudor Investment Corp. in New York. But heacknowledges that in the current deflationary environment,gold might not strengthen until the money supply expands andthere are signs of a strengthening economy.   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          Traders will shift their attention away from the failedcoup in Moscow, which caused farm futures prices to rallylast week on speculation that it will prompt more food aid tothe Soviet Union.   Prices of most grain and soybean futures contracts slippedin trading Friday amid profit-taking.   After the close of trading today, several major farmstates are slated to release their weekly reports on cropconditions. While most crops have matured enough so thatweather doesn't have as much influence on yields, soybeanscould still be helped by additional moisture. Dry conditionsin June and July already have trimmed the size of theimpending corn harvest.                                                                                                          Coffee                                                                                                          Prices might decline today in the wake of Brazil's denial,reported after the close of trading Friday, of rumors that ithad stopped registering exports again.   Coffee for September delivery surged 3.6 cents a pound to82.9 cents on Friday. The actively traded December coffeecontract rose 2.65 cents to 85.95 cents.   Prices had been strong before the rumor hit the market.Talk had circulated all week about plans afoot for producersto withhold 10% of their exportable coffee from the market toboost prices. The details aren't clear and many are skepticalthat it will work, analysts said, but the willingness ofcountries to seriously pursue the proposal is helping coffeeprices.   Prospects for a faster-growing Soviet Union economy in thewake of the coup's failure also are buoying prices, saidCeleste Georgakis, senior analyst at Cargill InvestorServices.   And, although notices of intentions to deliver coffeeagainst September futures have been heavy for two days, thecoffee was snapped up, said Judith Ganes, senior futuresanalyst at Merrill Lynch.   Because of all the other bullish factors in the market,Brazil's denial of the exportregistration rumor shouldn'tspark a big drop in prices, Ms. Ganes said.</TEXT></DOC>
