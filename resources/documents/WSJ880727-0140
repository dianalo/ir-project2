Receives Financing ---- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup </HL><SO> </SO><CO> FHP MS </CO><IN> TNM PUL </IN><TEXT>   An investor group said it received financing commitments necessary to complete its acquisition of Green Bay, Wis.-based Fort Howard Corp. for $3.55 billion, or $53 a share.    FH Acquisition Corp., which includes some members of Fort Howard's management and Morgan Stanley Group Inc., said the Bankers Trust unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp. has provided a commitment of $550 million of the $2.55 billion of bank financing. It said commitments for the remaining $2 billion have been received from five other banks, which will act as lead managers.    As reported earlier, Morgan Stanley and its Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II L.P. have agreed to provide $1.53 billion in so-called bridge loans and equity.    The paper company's board accepted the leveraged buy-out bid in late June, but 14 shareholder lawsuits have been filed to block the transaction on the grounds that the price is inadequate. FH Acquisition's tender offer is scheduled to expire Aug. 8.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    Fort Howard shares closed yesterday at $53.875, off 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
