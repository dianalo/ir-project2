Syrian and Christian gunners dueledacross the city's Green Line.   Hundreds of Christian youths protested outside the U.S. Embassyand accused the United States of supporting the Syrian role inLebanon.   Police said the Mercedes-Benz rigged with about 88 pounds of TNTwent off at 9:20 a.m. in the Mokalles district at Beirut'ssoutheastern edge. A pedestrian and the driver of a car parked nearthe Mercedes were reported killed.   A police spokesman said the detonation fuse was found unexplodedin the car's trunk, along with two mines.   ``We tend to believe the vehicle exploded by mistake. Maybe dueto an electrical short circuit,'' said a police spokesman, whocannot be named in line with regulations. ``Had the mines explodedthey would have shattered the whole district.''   The blast echoed across east Beirut. It set seven vehiclesablaze, including an army jeep, uprooted power poles and smashedglass in a 500-yard radius.   Christian radio stations interrupted programming with reports onthe blast and called on motorists to avoid the area. Ambulances andfire engines rushed to the scene to evacuate casualties and fightthe fire, which burned 40 minutes.   Power cables dangled from shrapnel-scarred buildings that wereblackened by smoke billowing from gutted cars.   Police and soldiers of the Christian army commander, Gen. MichelAoun, sealed off Mokalles to allow rescue teams through.   It was the sixth car bombing in Lebanon this year. By policecount, the previous five killed 28 people and wounded 218.   As ambulances evacuated victims from Mokalles, two mortar roundsfired by Syrian gunners exploded on the eastern, Christian side ofBeirut's Green Line, sending dust billowing into the sky.   The Syrian-Christian exchange, limited to front lines anddistricts close to them, killed one person and wounded three, bypolice count.   The 6-month-old confrontation between Aoun's 20,000 mainlyChristian troops and the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in Lebanon haskilled 827 people and wounded 2,452.   The current round of violence, one of the fiercest in the14-year-old civil war, broke out March 8 after Aoun's forcesblockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias.   Syrian troops and allied Lebanese forces retaliated by shellingthe 310-square-mile Christian enclave, home to about 1 millionpeople northeast of Beirut.   Aoun then declared a ``war of liberation'' against Syrian troopsin Lebanon, charging they betrayed a 1976 peacekeeping mandate bysiding with Moslems against Christians in the civil war.   About 1,000 Christian youths gathered near the main entrance tothe U.S. Embassy compound in Beirut's Christian suburb of Aoukar andaccused the United States of supporting the Syrians in the war-tornnation.   ``We declare the beginning of the peaceful siege of the U.S.Embassy,'' said Jubran Tueini of the Movement for Supporting theLiberation, which sponsored the rally.   Tueini is a member of the command council of the right-wingLebanese Forces, Aoun's main ally against the Syrians.   Sources at the U.S. Embassy, speaking on condition of anonymity,said Ambassador John McCarthy was not at the mission's offices.   ``McCarthy go home! McCarthy go home!'' the crowd chanted.   Tueini said the protest would continue ``until McCarthy submitshis credentials to the Lebanese authorities represented by GeneralAoun.''   McCarthy arrived in Lebanon in late September 1988. He has notsubmitted his credentials to avoid recognizing either of the rivalMoslem and Christian Cabinets vying for power in Lebanon.   Minutes before his term expired Sept. 22, 1988, former PresidentAmin Gemayel named Aoun _ a Maronite Catholic like himself _ to headan interim military Cabinet pending election by Parliament of a newhead of state.   A leading newspaper in Saudi Arabia reported Tuesday that KingFahd has postponed a trip to Washington for a second time because ofefforts involving the superpowers to end the bloodshed in Lebanon.   The daily Al-Riyadh indicated the contacts were focusing onreviving efforts by an Arab committee, of which Fahd is a member, toarrange a cease-fire.   ``It is not the United States alone which is looking forward toLebanon's salvation through the ... committee, but France and theSoviet Union also hope for that, along with other internationalforces,'' the newspaper said.   The visit, originally planned for July, was rescheduled for Sept.14 but put off again.</TEXT></DOC>
