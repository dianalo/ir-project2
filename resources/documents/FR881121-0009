A bilateral agreement is a signed, writtenagreement which has been negotiated by both parties, that is, the UnitedStates and a foreign country. A bilateral agreement virtually guaranteesemployment authorization for dependents of certain United States governmentofficials assigned to duty in the foreign country which signed the agreement.In turn it virtually guarantees employment authorization for dependentsof certain officials of that foreign country who are assigned to duty inthe United States. A de facto arrangement takes effect when the Departmentof State determines that a foreign country allows appropriate employmenton the local economy for dependents of certain United States officialsassigned to duty in that foreign country. Based on that determination,dependents of certain government officials of that foreign country assignedto duty in the United States may apply for employment authorization.Dependent employment authorization based on a de facto arrangement is moretenuous than authorization based on a bilateral agreement. This is becausea de facto arrangement is based on current practices and policies ratherthan mutually negotiated, well-defined obligations. The virtual assuranceof dependent employment authorization in a foreign country contributesto making duty there more attractive to a United States government officialwhose dependents wish to work while abroad or whose spouse wishes to pursuehis/her career. Recognizing the benefits, Congress has commissioned theDepartment of State to increase the number of bilateral agreements. (ForeignRelations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1979.)As a result these regulations were drafted in cooperation with the Departmentof State to make bilateral agreements clearly more advantageous to foreigncountries than de facto arrangements. This is accomplished principallythrough the following steps:(1) Modifying the definition of dependent, which was only applicable tobilateral agreements, to better reflect international obligations and practices.The new definition has been extended to apply to de facto arrangements.This extension eliminates the anomaly that has allowed unmarried childrenof any age to be considered as dependents under de facto arrangements whilelimiting unmarried children to a definite age under bilateral agreements.The new definition applies to dependent employment authorization only andnot to matters of visa issuance.(2) Clarifying that the applicability of bilateral agreements and de factoarrangements is based on the foreign state which employs the principalalien and not the nationality of the dependent. Based on a recommendationby the Department of State, the regulations require that under de factoarrangement, the principal alien also must have the same nationality asthe country he or she represents. This precludes employment authorizationunder de facto arrangements for dependents of principal aliens who arethird country nationals.These regulations allow dependents of certain G-1 principal aliens, a classnot covered by prior regulations, to apply for employment authorization.On the basis of reciprocity, the Congressional intent to increase the numberof bilateral agreements, equity and administrative considerations, it wasdecided to have the regulations governing G-1 dependents parallel the regulationsgoverning other dependents of foreign government officials in A-1 and A-2status.There has been no regulatory basis for granting employment authorizationto dependents of G-1 principal aliens. However, on the basis of bilateralagreements, de facto arrangements and other international considerations,G-1 dependents were granted employment authorization. The enactment ofthe Immigration Reform and Control Act (``IRCA'') with its strict documentaryrequirements has necessitated a review of this procedure and has resultedin the G-1 regulations. With the provisions of IRCA in force, the issuanceof G-1 dependent employment authorization has been suspended. The Departmentof State has advised the Service that the situation is straining the UnitedStates' relationship with a number of countries and could affect the UnitedStates' relations with more than 80 countries. The situation requires thatthese regulations, which allow for the employment of dependents of certainG-1 principal aliens, take effect immediately, a course of action withwhich the Department of State has expressed agreement. More than twentycountries have entered into bilateral agreements with the United Stateswhich permit G-1 dependents to work in the United States. The suspensionof work authorizations for G-1 dependents from these countries violatesformal international obligations of the United States and has developedinto a significant issue for some of these countries which are traditionalallies. In addition, approximately 60 other countries have previously enjoyedthe possibility of their G-1 dependents obtaining employment in the UnitedStates under de facto arrangements. The cessation of issuance of work authorizationto G-1 dependents jeopardizes the employment of dependents of United Statesofficials stationed abroad, the very individuals that the program of dependentemployment authorization is designed to assist. In order to avoid damageto United States foreign relations and to take United States dependentsout of jeopardy, it is imperative that these regulations be implementedimmediately.It is recognized that these regulations affect individuals who qualifyas dependents of G-1 officials but are not covered by terms of a bilateralagreement or de facto arrangement. In order not to penalize these individualswho meet the new definition of dependent, the interim regulations includea limited savings clause which will expire on or before December 31, 1989.Because new G-1 regulations are closely tied to and were developed in conjunctionwith the regulations permitting work authorization for dependents of certainA-1, A-2 and G-4 principal aliens, the Department of State and the Servicebelieve that all the new regulations on employment authorization for thedependents of certain A-1, A-2, G-1 and G-4 principal aliens should takeeffect at the same time.These regulations follow the long-standing policy of having regulationsgoverning employment authorization for dependents of G-4 principal aliens(employees of international organizations) parallel the provisions of defacto arrangements. Additionally, these regulations allow a very limitedtest of reciprocity in considering employment authorization for dependentsof certain G-4 principal aliens.These regulations give the Director of the Eastern Regional Service Centerauthority to adjudicate applications for employment authorization underde facto arrangements along with the District Directors at New York andWashington, DC. This will allow the Service more flexibility in adjudicatingsuch employment applications. The proposed regulations also clarify a dependent'stax liability.As stated earlier, foreign policy considerations mandate that this rulebe effective upon publication. It is recognized that immediate implementationwill cause some individuals to be unknowingly in violation of these regulations.To preclude this, to provide adequate notice to individuals who are nolonger eligible for employment authorization as a dependent, and to dealfairly with their employers, the following Service policy is set forth:An individual (1) who was considered a dependent of an A-1, A-2, G-1 orG-4 principal alien under the prior regulations or practices, and (2) whohad employment authorization under the prior regulations or practices,and (3) who is not eligible for employment authorization as a dependentunder the new regulation, will be allowed to work until February 20, 1989,or until the end of his/her employment authorization period, whichevercomes first. Such employment by such an individual for the stated periodof time shall not in any way be considered or construed to be a violationof nonimmigrant status.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of Immigration andNaturalization certifies that this rule does not have a significant adverseeconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule isnot a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nordoes this rule have federalism implications warranting the preparationof a Federal Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.The Information Collection Requirements contained in this regulation havebeen approved by the Office of Management and Budget, under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act, under control number 1115-0090.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>8 CFR Part 214Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Employment.8 CFR Part 274aAdministrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Employment.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 214_NONIMMIGRANT CLASSES</ITAG>1.
