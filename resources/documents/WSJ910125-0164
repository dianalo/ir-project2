A statement from Amoco Corp., Amoco Chemical's parent,said Indonesia's investment board granted a license to newlyformed P.T. Amoco Indoprakarsa to construct a plant producingpurified terephthalic acid. The petrochemical byproduct,known as PTA, is used mainly to make polyester fiber fortextiles.</LP><TEXT>   An Amoco unit, Amoco Chemical (Indonesia) Ltd., will hold50.1% of the shares in the joint venture. The remaining 49.9%will be held by P.T. Lumbung Usahakita. Amoco identifiedLumbung Usahakita's majority shareholder as the Salim Group,but didn't identify the other investors. The diversifiedSalim Group, headed by Liem Sioe Liong, has more than 200companies involved in banking, trading, manufacturing,property and other activities.   According to Amoco's plans, the new venture will beoperational by early 1994 and have an annual productioncapacity of 250,000 metric tons of PTA.   The Amoco-Salim venture is one of five proposed new PTAprojects for Indonesia. At present there's only one plant inproduction and it's owned by the state oil company Pertamina.However, several domestic business groups have been makingplans with foreign partners for other PTA plants to supplyIndonesia's growing textile industry.   Industry analysts say it's likely that only two or threeof the proposed projects will actually go ahead. StephenStroud, a vice president with Amoco Chemicals Far East Ltd.in Hong Kong, said that if all the proposed projects proceed,&quot;there will be vast overcapacity&quot; in Indonesia.   Uncertainty about the world economic situation due to thePersian Gulf war may create additional doubt about how manyof the Indonesian projects will unfold. Mr. Stroud said hedoesn't foresee the Gulf situation causing any change inAmoco's plans for the Indonesian venture, which is along-term investment.   In October, Mitsui andamp; Co. announced plans for a $200million PTA plant together with Pertamina and the HumpussGroup, led by the youngest of President Suharto's three sons.Another Indonesian group, P.T. Bakrie andamp; Brothers, has beenmaking plans with Mitsubishi Corp. for another PTA facility.   &quot;It looks like those who get going pretty fast will beassured of a local market,&quot; an industry analyst said. &quot;Butwith the Gulf crisis, Indonesian textiles probably can't keepbooming and the local market may not be as big as somethink.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
