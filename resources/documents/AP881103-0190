(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The sister of Lebanon hostage Terry Andersonon Thursday rejected President Reagan's allegation that herbrother's recently released videotaped message was written by hiscaptors.   ``I know my brother ... a lot better than Ronald Reagan,'' saidPeggy Say. ``There's not a word'' in that message that isn't his,she said.   Mrs. Say, speaking to a group of Buffalo State College students,said she knows her brother's writing style and it is much differentfrom his captors'.   ``I have seen communications from the captors and it's not thesame English as his,'' she said.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, in Beirut by Islamic Jihad, aShiite Moslem extremist group backed by Iran.   In a videotape released Monday, Anderson said he believed theU.S. government had blocked several attempts to free the nineAmerican hostages now held in Lebanon.   Reagan denied that, saying: ``I don't think that was Terryspeaking. ... I think he had a script that was given to him.''   Mrs. Say criticized Reagan for not doing more to win the releaseof the hostages.   ``I'm getting a double message from the government,'' she said.Administration responses suggest Anderson's life isn't worthnegotiating for, she contended, despite past negotiations on behalfof American hostages.   Mrs. Say said she agrees with the Reagan administration's policyof not openly negotiating with terrorists. However, the governmenthas in the past negotiated with terrorists, such as during theIran-Contra affair, she said.   ``I'm being told that Terry's life isn't worth as much as formerhostages'.''   Although Mrs. Say said Anderson ``looks better than he has at anyother time'' during his captivity, she doesn't think his appearancemeans he is being treated any better by his captors.   ``Terry Anderson is still chained to a basement wall somewhere,''she said.   Even so, Mrs. Say said she hopes her brother's improved lookcould mean the kidnappers are getting ready to release him.   ``I'd like to think they are preparing him for release,'' shesaid. ``But I know that's a remote chance.''</TEXT></DOC>
