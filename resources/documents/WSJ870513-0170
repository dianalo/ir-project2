Where does the resident of Atlanta, Kansas City or McCool Junction, Nebraska go for help?    The local medical oncologist should not be overlooked. After completing a residency in internal medicine, an oncologist must spend two additional years studying the natural history, diagnosis, staging and treatment of cancer. The oncologist should be able to evaluate any cancer patient and recommend appropriate therapy. Access should not be a problem since there are more than 5,000 oncologists in the U.S.    The National Cancer Institute (NCI) sponsors approximately 50 Community Clinical Oncology Programs (CCOP) across the country. These CCOPs are designed to bring state-of-the-art cancer care to regional areas and to assist in testing new cancer therapies. Competition for CCOP status is rigorous; each center must compete for a grant renewal every three years. CCOPs also provide second opinions as part of their mission. Patients can locate the nearest CCOP through the Cancer Information Line (1-800-4-CANCER). The American Cancer Society number (1-800-ACS-2345), given in your report, deserves a second mention.    John Bloch, the tax specialist, narrowly missed a cancer cure due to outdated advice. He organized PDQ, a computer data bank for physicians. Now administered by the NCI, the service lists all physicians qualified to care for cancer patients, updated outlines of treatment, and all current experimental trials. Many libraries have access to the service and will provide the printout to patients for a service charge.    Fighting cancer is difficult enough; ignorance only will make the therapy terrifying. Oncology is a new specialty and often there are several correct methods of treatment for a particular cancer. Legitimate conflicting opinions can be confusing. The oncologist and patient need to discuss the toxicity and benefits of each therapeutic option and select the one best suited for that patient. Fortunately, there are resources available to patients everywhere to help make that decision.    Lee N.
