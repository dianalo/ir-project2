The Final RegulatoryImpact Analysis describing the options considered in developing these rulesand the impact of implementing each option is available on request fromthe above office.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>These rules are issued in conformitywith Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation. This action will not (1)have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) resultin a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investmentor productivity, innovation, or on the ability of the United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets and therefore has been determined to be ``not major.''This action does not fall within the scope of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. REA has concluded that promulgation of these rules would not representa major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C.4321 et seq. (1976)) and, therefore, does not require an environmentalimpact statement or an environmental assessment.In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507),the reporting and recordkeeping provisions that are included in these finalrules have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).The OMB approval number for these requirements is 0572-0079.Public reporting burden of this collection of information is estimatedto average 7.8 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send commentsregarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection ofinformation, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Departmentof Agriculture, Clearance Officer, OIRM, Room 404-W, Washington, DC 20250;and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project(OMB andplusmin;0572-0079), Washington, DC 20503.This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance underNo. 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, RuralTelephone Bank Loans. For the reasons set forth in the final rule relatedto Notice 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V (50 FR 47034, November 14, 1985),this program is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 whichrequires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Currently, the policies and requirements concerning telephone loans andthe administrative policies, requirements and procedures covering preloanactivities are contained in numerous REA Bulletins, several sections ofthe REA Telecommunications Engineering and Construction Manual (TEandamp;CM)and the REA Telecommunications Operations Manual (TOM), and REA Staff Instructions(internal instructions for REA personnel). Many of these are outdated andcontain conflicting information. It is necessary to consolidate the informationand make it available to the public by publishing it in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.There is currently considerable confusion over what constitutes an AreaCoverage Design (ACD) or a Supplemental Loan Proposal (SLP). These arereplaced with a streamlined Loan Design (LD) which will be the basis fordetermining the amount and purposes of all loans. Most of the items includedin the LD are similar for all loans. There are, however, certain data requirementsthat apply only to initial loans and loans to serve areas not previouslyfinanced by REA, and other data requirements that apply to subsequent loans.Some supplementary information is also required to support a loan application.Currently, this information is often submitted over a period of time. Inthe future, it will all be submitted at one time, with the LD. This willend confusion over the status of an application and when all of the requiredinformation is to be completed and submitted. REA office engineers andloan specialists will be able to prepare a cost study and loan recommendationwithout having to wait for a large amount of additional information tobe submitted. With all the information required to process a loan receivedat one time, financial and statistical data will all be as of the samedate, simplifying processing. As necessary, REA staff will continue toassist borrowers during the preloan period.These rules eliminate some reporting requirements and streamline others,reducing the borrowers' burden. Generally, borrowers will be required tosubmit only the year-end Financial and Statistical Report (REA Form 479).They will no longer have to submit June 30 reports as are now requiredwhen the loan is made 9 or more months after the date of the last year-endreport. Borrowers will be required to submit only rate schedules, and nottheir entire tariff. Borrowers are currently required to submit their tariffto the Area Office. This can be quite a large document, and to send a copyto REA costs a borrower a significant amount for copying and postage. Therate schedules normally are only a few pages and generally provide allthe tariff information necessary to prepare a feasibility study. Borrowerswill still be required to have their tariff available for review by theREA field representative, as necessary.Joint use agreements will no longer have to be submitted to REA for reviewand approval. REA Form 809, ``Fundamental Plan Information,'' is eliminated.Certain of the information on this form will be shown on the trunking diagramrequired as an exhibit to the LD. The rest of the information is no longerneeded. Many borrowers now produce equivalents of REA Forms 569, ``AreaCoverage Survey Report;'' 495, ``Construction Cost Estimates;'' and 494,``Loan Design Summary.'' These equivalents will now be accepted by REA,which will save the borrower the time and expense of transferring the datato the REA forms.Recognizing the growing experience of borrowers and their familiarity withREA design criteria and construction standards, greater reliance will beplaced on certifications provided by borrowers and their engineers. Currently,a principal of the engineering firm, the borrower and the REA field representativeall sign the same certification as to the correctness and reasonablenessof the LD. In the future, only the engineer and borrower will sign thecertification, which has been expanded to include the certification that``this Loan Design adheres to REA engineering and construction standardsand practices.'' This places a greater responsibility on the borrower andengineer, and provides REA greater loan security. The REA field representativewill now review and recommend acceptance of the LD as the basis for REAfinancing. Final approval of the LD will rest with the Area Director.If a recommended LD and the required supplementary information are notsubmitted within 1 year of the date of the loan application, the applicationgenerally will be cancelled by REA. There currently is no formal procedurefor determining when a loan application should be cancelled. The borrowerwill now be given a time limit to complete its loan application. One yearis an ample amount of time in which to prepare a LD.The present maximum loan period is 35 years, with a 32-year amortizationperiod. With rapidly changing technology, obsolescence is occurring morequickly; therefore, borrowers are depreciating their facilities at a fasterrate. New plant facilities, especially digital central offices, are generallydepreciated at a higher rate than the plant replaced. About 95 percentof REA telephone borrowers have composite depreciation rates for all plantof at least 4 percent; about 84 percent have a rate of at least 4.5 percent.The median for all REA telephone borrowers is now 5.6 percent.If plant financed by an REA loan is retired and replaced by new plant beforethe loan is repaid, earnings from this new plant will have to be used topay the old loan and any new loan used to finance the replacement facilities.If the loan period is longer than the depreciation period and the capitalrecovered through depreciation is not used to replace plant, the loan couldbe undercollateralized and the borrower's rate base would be eroded.The loan period will now approximate the anticipated useful life of thefacilities financed. The maximum loan period for all loans will remainat 35 years, with a 32-year amortization period.The principal deferment period will be reduced to 2 years. Currently, onadvances of loan funds within 3 years of the date of the note representinga loan, borrowers do not begin repaying principal until the first basisdate. This is 3 years after the date of the note. For funds advanced fromthat date until the second basis date, 6 years after the date of the note,borrowers do not begin repaying principal until that second basis date.All funds advanced during a particular basis date period are amortizedat the same rate. Unless a new basis date agreement is executed, the borrowercannot draw down any unadvanced loan funds after the second basis date.The new system would set the basis date 2 years after the date of the noteand defer the start of principal repayments until then. There would beno second basis date. Principal repayments on all funds advanced afterthe basis date would begin with the first billing after the advance. Thus,each of these advances would have a different amortization rate. At theAdministrator's discretion, the 2-year deferment could be altered.This change is being made because a significant portion of loan funds shouldbe advanced within 2 years of the date of the note. The retention of adeferment period allows the borrower to have a substantial portion of thenew plant in place and earning revenues with which to repay the loan. Under the current form of note, the Government is not obligated to advancefunds after 6 years. The final rule changes this to 5 years and establisheda procedure for extending this period in certain circumstances. 7 CFR Part 1745 supersedes any sections of REA Bulletin 320-12, ``LoanPayments and Statements'', with which it is in conflict. Currently, there is no minimum for REA loans. The Rural Telephone Bankhas had a $50,000 minimum for a number of years. Recognizing the increasein plant costs, the borrowers' expenses for system design, and REA's administrativecosts, REA will no longer consider applications for loans of less than$50,000. Subsidized loans are provided to telephone borrowers for the purpose ofproviding and improving telephone service in rural areas. These subsidiesare not provided for purposes beyond those unauthorized by the RE Act.In accordance with REA Bulletins 320-1, 320-4, and 320-14, REA generallydoes not finance (1) headquarters facilities other than warehouse and garagefacilities, (2) office equipment, (3) vehicles and other work equipment,(4) furniture, and (5) station apparatus and associated inside wiring.REA will continue to finance the first four items only in cases of financialhardship, as determined by the Administrator. REA will no longer financethe last item. These changes are based on considerations of loan securityand the borrowers' net worth and financial strength. Station apparatus and inside wiring have been deregulated and generallyare not capitalized. Borrowers are no longer obligated to provide theseitems. To improve the security of REA's loans and the borrowers' financialposition, borrowers are encouraged to invest internally generated fundsin the five items listed above. REA will continue to not finance any duplicative facilities. Additionally,REA will not finance facilities to serve subscribers outside the localexchange service areas of the borrower unless those facilities are necessaryto furnishing or improving telephone service in rural areas. This restrictionis aimed primarily at preventing the financing of services that are outsideof a borrower's territory and which primarily serve nonrural subscribers.REA will still finance those portions serving subscribers within the borrower'sterritory. For many years REA has had a policy of not making a loan for the same purposestwice. The intent of this policy was to prevent a borrower from rescindinga loan solely for the purpose of refinancing the loan. This policy is nowbeing codified in clarified form. Based on loan security considerations, REA will now require that beforea loan is approved by REA a borrower must meet certain Times Interest EarnedRatio (TIER) requirements, except when the Administrator determines thatthe borrower would experience financial hardship. For a loan made solelyby REA, a borrower must have a TIER of at least 125 percent on all of itsoutstanding and proposed loans from REA and all other lenders as determinedby the feasibility study prepared in connection with the loan, unless theborrower is subject to the provisions discussed in the next paragraph.The mortgage will contain a provision requiring the borrower to maintaina TIER of at least 125 percent. The borrower will also be expected to demonstrateprogress toward achieving a TIER of 150 percent. For a loan guaranteed by REA, made concurrently by REA and RTB, or madeentirely by RTB, a borrower must have a TIER of at least 150 percent onall of its outstanding and proposed loans from REA and all other lendersas determined by the feasibility study prepared in connection with theloan. The mortgage will contain a provision requiring the borrower to maintaina TIER of 150 percent. A new policy will allow REA, for loan security purposes, to require a newapplicant to increase its net worth as a percentage of assets to the highestlevel not to exceed 40 percent, recorded at the end of any calendar quartersince 2 years prior to the receipt by REA of the borrower's loan applicationform (REA Form 490). This restoration to the higher level of net worthshall take place before REA will determine the feasibility of the proposedloan. REA believes these revised policies, requirements, and procedures willlessen the burden on borrowers and permit REA to maintain the securityof the Government's loans. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments </ITAG>In the proposed rules published August 24, 1988 (53 FR 32235), the RuralElectrification Adminstration invited interested parties to file commentson or before September 23, 1988. Comments were received from: 37 Members of Congress, 7 Telephone TradeAssociations, 68 Borrowers, 2 Other Interested Parties. The comments received addressed the following issues and Sections of theRules: <T3>Extension of Time for Comments </T3>Several respondents requested an extension of the 30 day time period forsubmission of written comments on proposed rules 7 CFR Parts 1745 and 1749.The 30 day public comment period was chosen because of the time constraintsimposed by Pub. L. 100-203. Section 1745.2(e) <T3>Definitions_Rural Areas</T3>One respondent stated that the definition of ``rural area'' should makeit clear that ``rural area'' includes territories and possessions of theUnited States. Accordingly we have clarified the definition of ``ruralarea'' in andSection;andSection;1745.2 and 1749.2 to read: ``Rural area'' meansany area of the United States, its territories and insular possessionsnot included within the boundaries * * *.The language of this section has also been modified to clearly indicatethat the data sources listed are not intended to be exclusive sources.Section 1745.2(g) <T3>Definitions_Times Interest Earned Ratio</T3>One respondent noted two technical corrections in this definition thatwould put it in conformance with the way the term is generally definedby the financial community. The first is that a time period, namely 1 year,needs to be included in the definition. The second is that only intereston debt with a maturity greater than one year should be included in thedefinition.Several respondents objected to the definition of ``Times Interest EarnedRatio'' being on a pre-tax basis. They note that Section 408(b)(4)(ii)of the RE Act uses a TIER based on ``net income or margins before interest''and interpret this phrase to mean after taxes. They also note that theRTB has historically used an after tax TIER in its feasibility computation.The technical corrections have been made as suggested. In view of the historicaluse of an after tax TIER by the RTB as a pro forma feasibility test, thedefinition has been modified to an after tax TIER for purposes of Section408(b)(4)(ii) of the RE Act.Section 1745.10 <T3>General</T3>One respondent requested that andSection;1745.10 be modified to recognizethat REA provides funds for refinancing as well as financing to furnishedand improve telephone service in rural areas. As refinancing is addressedin detail under andSection;1745.21, no change has been made.Section 1745.11 <T3>Area Coverage</T3>Thirteen respondents objected to the use of the phrase ``on a cost effectivebasis'' in the section on area coverage. The comments state that ``costeffective'' is not defined and that the phrase places a new requirementon borrowers which will result in fewer loans and limit access to the program.It was not the intent of REA to change the area coverage policy as statedin the Act. The phrasing of the Act has always been interpreted to meanon a ``cost effective basis''. These words were used to reflect the historicpractice of REA and consequently do not impose any new requirement on borrowersor limit access to the program.To impose the area coverage provision when the costs would be exorbitantwould be burdensome to borrowers and counter productive to achieving theobjectives of the RE Act. We have none the less deleted the phrase ``costeffective'' because it is not necessary. The provisions of the loan contractwill cover the implementation of the area coverage policy.Section 1745.13 <T3>Location of Facilities * * * Nonrural Subscribers</T3>Several respondents objected to the inclusion of ``incidental'' as a testfor financing facilities in nonrural areas. The test for financing facilitiesin nonrural areas reflects REA interpretation of the Act as it has beenconsisently applied since the inception of the REA loan program. Section201 of the Act provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">When it is determined by the Administrator to be necessary in orderto furnish or improve telephone service in rural areas, such loans maybe made for the improvement, expansion, construction, acquisition and operationof telephone lines, facilities, or systems without regard to their geographicallocation.</ITAG>Pursuant to this provision the Administrator has included in loans fundsto finance urban facilities only where the primary purpose of the loanis furnishing and improving service to rural areas and the financing ofurban facilities serves only as an incidental means to the accomplishmentof this primary purpose. This determination has and can be made only ona case-by-case basis considering such matters as subscriber ratios andcost ratios. A discussion of the legal principals underlying this interpretationof the Act as well as its application in specific cases is set forth ina series of opinions to the Administrator from the Office of General Counsel,Department of Agriculture.One respondent suggested that clarification be added to indicate that financingof facilities to benefit nonrural subscribers is not limited to the examplescited. Clarification has been added.Section 1745.14 <T3>Borrower Eligibility</T3>One respondent pointed out that the last sentence of andSection;1745.14 inadvertentlyomits start-up telephone systems that propose to serve new areas. REA agreesthat new systems are eligible for loans, as stated in the first sentenceof andSection;1745.14, and has therefore changed the last sentence to read* * * To be eligible for a loan, a borrower must provide or propose toprovide the basic local exchange telephone service needs of rural areas,and it must be incorporated.Section 1745.17(b) <T3>Facilities Financed</T3>A number of respondents objected to the restriction placed on financingof facilities listed in this section stating that the Act clearly allowsfinancing of said facilities. This section is a restatement of existingregulations that have been in effect for a number of years. The sectiondoes not eliminate financing of the facilities but only limits financingto cases of financial hardship. REA has determined that this restrictionis appropriate considering that the facilities covered generally are non-revenueproducing or have short economic lives, or are highly mobile and representpoor collateral.Section 1745.17(c) <T3>Facilities Financed</T3>A number of respondents objected to eliminating financing of the facilitieslisted in this section arguing that the Act provides for such financing.REA considers furniture, which is generally expensed rather than capitalized,and is highly mobile and thus affords poor collateral, to be an inappropriateitem for long term financing. However, it has been removed from this listof items not eligible for financing and added to the list of items limitedto financing in cases of financial hardship.Since deregulation of station apparatus and associated inside wiring, itis the responsibility of the subscriber and not the borrower to providestation apparatus and associated inside wiring. As the borrower no longerneeds to purchase said items to provide telephone service, REA is no longerfinancing such items.A number of respondents questioned the provision that REA does not financeduplicative toll facilities. REA agrees that toll facilities should notbe singled out and the wording has been changed to ``any duplicative facilities.'' Section 1745.17(d) Facilities FinancedSeveral respondents objected to this section on the basis that it couldpotentially deny benefits to intended beneficiaries of the Act. The purposeof this policy has always been to prevent borrowers from rescinding loansin order to reapply for a loan that may have more favorable terms. Thiswould result in a wasteful and unnecessary use of REA's annual lendingauthority and an abuse of the program. REA considers this policy necessaryfor the effective application of the eligibility criteria set forth inthe Act for the various loan programs administered by the Agency. To clearlystate this policy andSection; 1745.17(d) has been modified and andSection;1745.47, rescission of loans has been added. Section 1747.47(a) is a statementof existing policy based on the requirements of the loan documents. Section 1745.18 Additional EquitySeveral respondents opposed andSection; 1745.18, believing the additionalequity requirement to be arbitrary in terms of time frame and unnecessaryin light of the telephone program's no-default history. Most respondentsassumed this section would apply to all borrowers. However, the sectionwas intended to apply only to initial loan applicants and wording to clarifythis has been added. The section is needed to prevent a new applicant,who would not be subject to REA mortgage controls, from intentionally orunintentionally degrading the viability of the system and the securityof the facilities to be mortgaged prior to approval of the loan. A capof 40 percent has been set on the net worth restoration required in thissection to be consistent with the maximum net worth provision of existingmortgages. Section 1745.19 Mergers and ConsolidationsThere were two comments on andSection; 1745.19. One comment requested thatthe rule state that additional loans are dependent upon continued eligibility,or be deleted while the other recommended the section be eliminated. REAbelieves this section to be necessary and clearly worded. The comment suggestingthe rule be clarified objected to the phrase ``REA will consider makingloans * * *.'' REA has retained this phrase because loans made by REA aredependent on all aspects of eligibility and thus it is inappropriate tostate that REA will make a loan without ``considering'' all aspects ofa surviving company's eligibility. Section 1745.20 AcquisitionsSeveral respondents objected to the inclusion of a ``necessary and incidental''test for acquisitions. The test for financing acquisitions reflects REA'sinterpretation of the Act as it has been consistently applied since theinception of the REA loan program. Section 201 of the Act, which explicitlypermits loans for the acquisition of telephone facilities, provides thatthe primary purpose of the loan must be to furnish and improve telephoneservice in rural areas. Pursuant to section 201, the Administrator hasapproved loans which include funds for acquiring facilities only wherethe Administrator determined that financing the acquisition of facilitiesis a necessary and incidental means to accomplishing the primary purposeof the loan_furnishing and improving telephone service in rural areas.This determination can be made only on a case-by-case basis taking intoaccount such matters as subscriber ratios and cost ratios. The legal principalsunderlying this interpretation and its application to certain specificcases are set forth in several opinions to the Administrator from the Officeof General Counsel, Department of Agriculture. Section 1745.21(b) Refinancing LoansTwo respondents objected to the provision prohibiting refinancing solelyto enable borrowers to lower interest rates, arguing that this is not alimitation authorized by the RE Act. One of the test specified by the REAct is that the refinancing must be necessary to furnishing or improvingtelephone service in rural areas. If a borrower can carry the debt servicerequirements of existing indebtedness without jeopardizing the viabilityof the proposed loan project, refinancing is not ``necessary'' as providedby the RE Act. Thus, this section is clearly within the terms of the REAct.One respondent objected to the provision that REA could require the borrowerto liquidate existing indebtedness with its own funds. This provision isnecessary in conjunction with the other provision of this section to preventREA from being required to refinance indebtedness that does not meet therequirements of the RE Act or REA regulations. Without this control a borrowercould claim eligibility for purposes clearly outside the intent of theAct by first financing them with non-REA loans and then invoking the refinancingof the Act.Section 1745.21(c) Refinancing LoansSeveral respondents expressed concern that this section does not recognizethat REA may accommodate or subordinate its lien to permit other lendersto provide financing to borrowers. REA's policy on lien accommodation andsubordination is contained in 7 CFR Part 1747. Paragraph (c) of andSection;1745.21applies to situations not covered under 7 CFR Part 1747, or when the otherlender is unwilling to accommodate or subordinate its lien.Section 1745.21 (d) and (e) Refinancing LoansSeveral respondents objected to the restriction on refinancing containedin these parts. Parts (d) and (e) rather than being restrictive, allowREA flexibility to determine other situations where refinancing could be``necessary'' under the RE Act.Section 1745.22(f) Loan Security_TIERA majority of respondents objected to this provision. They claim that itwould disqualify a large number of borrowers from additional financing.Others noted that the RE Act does not specifically provide for such requirement.The TIER requirements in the final rule of 1.25 for REA loans and 1.5 forRTB loans will not have the severe impact suggested by these comments.For example, with respect to the proposed requirements on TIER (times interestearned ratio), the vast majority of our borrowers already meet this requirement.Ninety-five percent of our borrowers have a TIER of 125 or greater, 93percent have a TIER of 150 or greater. Those borrowers that have a TIERbelow these minimums appear to be about average in comparison to our otherborrowers in terms of economic and financial characteristics, such as subscriberdensity (number per route mile), net profit per subscriber, operating expenseper subscriber, etc. It appears that most of these borrowers would nothave any more difficulty in meeting the minimum requirements for TIER thanthose borrowers that already meet the requirements.Moreover, under this rule the Administrator would have the authority towaive the TIER requirements if they would impose a financial burden onthe borrower.The Rural Electrification Act (RE Act) requires that a borrower must beable to meet a TIER of 150 to be eligible for a RTB loan. The rule simplyprovides assurance that RTB borrowers will continue to maintain a 150 TIER.Nor is a 150 TIER requirement new to REA. For years the electric programhas required its borrowers to maintain a 150 TIER. Moreover, a minimumTIER of 150 for telephone loans is required by the Rural Telephone FinanceCooperative, which is owned by REA borrowers, as well as by virtually allother private lenders. For these reasons the final rule includes the TIERrequirements as proposed.Section 1745.22(f) and (g) Loan Security_Net WorthA majority of respondents objected to the provisions for a minimum networth requirement. REA has concluded that this additional security requirementis not needed at this time. Consequently andSection; 1745.22(g) has beendeleted from the final rule.Section 1745.31 RTB LoansSeveral respondents objected to the provision in this section RTB loansbe made in preference to REA loans. Such preference is required by section408(b)(2) of the RE Act.One respondent questioned the legal authority to make RTB loans concurrentlywith a guaranteed loan. REA concluded that such concurrent loans can bemade under the Act.Section 1745.32(a) Guaranteed LoansOne respondent found ``no basis for determining that applications requiring$7 million should be approved as loan guarantees.'' The regulation doesnot state that all applications over $7 million will be approved as guaranteedloans. This level is only one criterion for considering the applicationas a guarantee. The $7 million level is a restatement of existing policyas published in a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice dated September 8, 1975, Vol. 40, No.174.Section 1745.32 (a) and (b) Guaranteed LoansOne respondent expressed concern that these parts would prohibit borrowersfrom obtaining a loan guarantee. REA did not intend such restriction andhas added language to make this clear.Section 1745.42 Automatic RescissionsThe majority of commentators objected to the inclusion of andSection;1745.42which institutes automatic rescissions of all telephone loan funds notencumbered 5 years after the date of the note. This provision has beendeleted and andSection;1745.42 has been retitled <T3>Extension of Advances.</T3> The wording of andSection;1745.42(b) hasbeen retained in modified form to provide for extension of advances pasta 5-year period (currently 6 years) provided for in the notes.It should be understood that the loan contract currently used by REA containsa provision allowing the Administrator to terminate advances of loan fundsthree years after the date of the loan contract or most recent amendmentthereto. Also under the current form of note, the Government is not obligatedto advance funds after 6 years. In the final rule this period is 5 years.Section 1745.43(a) Payment on LoansA majority of respondents objected to both the matching of the loan maturityto the economic life of the facilities and the reduction of the maximumloan period to 22 years. The final rule establishes that the repaymentperiod will be based on the approximate useful life of the facilities financed.Collateral for REA loans rests on the value of the facilities financed.REA relies on the revenues produced by the facilities financed for repaymentof the loans. If the loan repayment period is greater than the economiclife of the facilities financed the long term results can be undercollateralizationand rate base erosion.A number of respondents argued that reducing the loan amortization periodfrom 35 years to the actual depreciation period would increase borrowers'capital costs and thus increase rates to subscribers. As the regulationties the loan amortization period to the borrowers' actual depreciationperiod, the capital recovered through depreciation is sufficient to meetthe principal payments without any increase in rates. In fact, if the loanperiod exceeds the depreciation period, interest costs over the life ofthe loan are increased and these costs are ultimately borne by the ratepayer.It is general practice for lenders making loans for capital assets to setthe amortization period of the loan equal to the expected economic lifeof the items financed. Consequently, REA is not seeking to establish aunique requirement in this area. In fact, when the term for REA loans wasoriginally established at 35 years, the expected economic life of typicaltelephone facilities closely approximated this period. REA is updatingits policy to recognize changes in the industry that have resulted in shortereconomic lives for many types of telecommunications equipment.Section 1745.43(b) Payment on LoansA majority of respondents objected to a single two-year deferment periodon principal repayments since the typical construction period is generallylonger.This provision is entirely consistent with the intent of the RE Act. Theexisting principal deferment provision was established nearly 40 yearsago when many new telephone cooperatives were being started from scratch,and these systems did not have an ongoing operation generating sufficientrevenues during the first years to meet payments on both principal andinterest. That situation has changed greatly. All loans made today areeither to existing borrowers or new borrowers that have established telephonesystems and thus have the cash flow from the beginning to meet both principaland interest payments. In the past 25 years, REA has financed the establishmentof only three new telephone systems, two cooperatives in Alaska (1980)and a system owned by an Indian tribe in Arizona (1985). In the event anynew systems are financed in the future, the Administrator could increasethe 2-year deferment period for these loans. It should also be noted thatthe principal deferment period is 2 years in the electric program.Section 1745.46 Loan Security DocumentsOne respondent stated that andSection; 1745.46 was too vague regarding thesharing of collateral with other lenders. Part 1745 is intended to stateonly the general policies and requirements of the REA telephone program.The specific policy on sharing collateral with other lenders is containedin 7 CFR Part 1747, Lien Accommodations. Section 1745.46 has been revisedto reference the chapter on lien accommodation and subordination.Section 1745.51 Required FindingsFour respondents objected to the factors listed for considering the securityof a proposed loan on the basis that they are not objective and/or wouldexclude numerous borrowers from obtaining loans. The RE Act requires that``Loans under this section (201) shall not be made unless the Administratorfinds and certifies that in his <T3>judgment</T3> (emphasis added) the security therefore is reasonablyadequate * * *''. This section lists the factors the Administrator mayconsider in making a judgment about security and is clearly within theauthority granted to the Administrator by the RE Act.Section 1745.51(a)(3) Required FindingsTwo respondents objected to the ``appropriate'' local service rate provisionon the grounds it lacked objectivity and that REA lacks the authority toregulate rates.This section recognizes that REA may consider whether local service rateswill yield adequate revenues to support the proposed loan. If REA determinesthat an increase in revenues is necessary to support the loan, the borrowercan be required to seek said increases as a condition of the loan.Section 1749.2(f) Definitions_Interim FinancingOne respondent requested a clearer definition of interim financing to referencethe fact that the borrower has applied for REA financing to replace theinterim financing. Accordingly, we have changed the definition to clarifythis point. Further explanation of the interim financing process is containedin 7 CFR Part 1749, Subpart E, ``Interim Financing of Construction of TelephoneFacilities.''Section 1749.2(h) Definitions_Rural AreasSee andSection; 1745.2(e).Section 1749.20 The Loan Application FormSeveral respondents objected to the cancellation of loan applications after1 year if the Loan Design and supplementary information have not been received.We have added language to clarify that the application is cancelled withoutprejudice and that the prospective borrower may reapply at any time forthe same or other loan purposes. The intent of this section is to encourageborrowers to promptly pursue completion of preloan requirements and toeffectively manage the distribution of the workload amongst REA staff.Section 1749.31(e) Area Coverage SurveySeveral respondents requested that this section be changed to require REAaction within a specified time frame.REA will carry out its responsibilities in a timely manner. Due to thedifferent conditions and characteristics of each loan proposal, it is notpossible to set specific time frames that would be appropriate for allcircumstances.Section 1749.40 General (Interim FinancingOne respondent requested that this subpart be deleted and borrowers begiven the latitude to incur short-term interim debt as they see fit.We agree that borrowers should have the flexibility to construct plantwhen they need to. However, if the construction must proceed prior to loanfunds becoming available, a method has to be establishing to allow thisto happen and yet assure REA that the construction will be qualified forREA financing in accordance with the same rules that pertain to all post-loanfunded construction.If a borrower does proper long-range financial and construction planning,the need for interim financing should be minimal.We feel the establishment of Subpart E provides more flexibility for borrowersto meet their obligations on a timely basis.Section 1749.41(c)(3) Interim FinancingOne respondent objected to the open-ended nature and lack of objectivityof this restriction. This provision is necessary because every situationof interim financing that might jeopardize loan security or other Act requirementscan't be identified in advance.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Parts 1745 and 1749</ITAG>Loan programs_communications, Telecommunications, Telephone.Therefore, REA amends 7 CFR Chapter XVII by adding the following new Parts1745 and 1749:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 1745_GENERAL POLICIES, TYPES OF LOANS, LOAN REQUIREMENTS_TELEPHONEPROGRAM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.1 General statement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.2 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.3 Availability of forms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Loan Purposes and Basic Policies</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.10 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.11 Area coverage.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.12 Nonduplication.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.13 Location of facilities and service for nonrural subscribers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.14 Borrower eligibility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.15 Civil rights.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.16 Minimum loan amount.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.17 Facilities financed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.18 Additional equity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.19 Mergers and consolidations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.20 Acquisitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.21 Refinancing loans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.22 Loan security.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Types of Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.30 Insured loans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.31 Rural telephone bank loans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.32 Guaranteed loans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Terms of Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.40 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.41 Notes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.42 Extension of advances.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.43 Payments on loans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.44 Prepayment premiums.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.45 Extension of payments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.46 Loan security documents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.47 Rescission of loans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Requirements for Loan Approval</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.50 Administrative findings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.51 Required findings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1745.52 Findings required for particular loan purposes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>7 U.S.C. 901 et seq., 7 U.S.C. 1921 et seq.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1745.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General statement.</ITAG>This CFR part supersedes all portions of the following REA Bulletins whichare in conflict with it:<ITAG tagnum="15">320-4 Preloan Procedures for Telephone Loan Applicants</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">320-22 Guarantee of Loans for Telephone Facilities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">321-2 Loan Security Requirements for Telephone Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">22-2 Rural Area Coverage_Telephone Loans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">323-1 Determination by Administrator with Respect to Nonduplicationof Lines, Facilities, or Systems</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">325-1 Financing Lines, Facilities, or Systems Outside of Rural Areas</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">326-1 Acquisitions of Telephone Facilities and Systems</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">385-5 Loans to Finance Radio Equipment for Subscriber Service</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1745.2 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">As used in this part:(a) ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of REA.(b) ``Borrower'' means any organization which has an outstanding loan madeor guaranteed by REA, or which is seeking such financing.(c) ``Feasibility study'' means the pro forma financial analysis performedby REA to determine the economic feasibility of a loan.

A major telephone loan is a loan requiring over 7 milliondollars or such other sum as may be determined from time to time by theAdministrator. Guaranteed loans may be made concurrently with insured loansor RTB loans. REA will consider guaranteeing a loan if the borrower meetsall requirements set forth in regulations applicable to a loan made byREA. No fees or charges are assessed for any guarantee of a loan providedby REA. In view of the Government's guarantee, REA generally obtains afirst lien on all assets of the borrower; see 7 CFR 1745.46. REA will considerapplications less than $7 million for a loan guarantee when the borrowerspecifically requests a guarantee.(b) <T3>New worth requirements.</T3> REA generally requires that borrowersseeking guaranteed loans have a net worth in excess of 20 percent of assets.For the purpose of this section, the term ``net worth'' means ``Total RetainedEarnings or Margins and Capital Credits'' plus either ``Total Capital StockOutstanding and Subscribed'' or ``Total Membership and Capital Certificates''as reported to REA pursuant to REA Telecommunications Operations ManualSection 1800.

The expecteduseful life shall be based on the composite depreciation rates that theborrower proposes for the facilities financed by the loan, provided thatthese rates are deemed appropriate by REA. In states where the borrowermust obtain state regulatory commission approval of depreciation ratesfor rate making purposes, the depreciation rates used shall be the ratescurrently approved by the state commission or rates for which the borrowershall seek state commission approval, provided that these rates are deemedappropriate by REA. In cases where a state regulatory commission does notapprove depreciation rates, if the rates proposed by the borrower are notdeemed appropriate by REA, REA shall base expected useful life on acceptedindustry standards. Borrowers may request a repayment period that is shorterthan the expected useful life of the facilities financed. The Administratormay approve a longer period, up to 35 years, if the borrower would otherwiseexperience financial hardship.(b) Principal and interest will be repaid in accordance with the termsof the notes. Generally, interest is payable each month as it accrues.Principal payments on each note generally are scheduled to begin 2 yearsafter the date of the note. After this deferral period, interest and principalpayments on all funds advanced during this 2-year period are scheduledin equal monthly installments. Principal payments on funds advanced 2 yearsor more after the date of the note will begin with the first billing afterthe advance.
