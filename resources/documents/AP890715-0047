Despite the words of encouragement for Poland and Hungary, theleaders' declaration showed no evidence of immediate aid to matchthe the $125 million package of incentives President Bush extendedto the two Communist bloc nations earlier this week.   Nor were there any joint sanctions against China.   A declaration on political issues was issued at the midpoint of aseven-nation summit of the United States, Britain, France, WestGermany, Italy, Canada and Japan.   At the urging of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the documentwas amended by the leaders to emphasize the ``urgent need for food''assistance for Poland, where shortages are rampant.   The document called for a meeting of ``all interested countries''within the next few weeks to discuss ways to reward reforms in bothPoland and Hungary.   Bush played down the absence of specific aid commitments,although the seven leaders promised to consider and coordinateeconomic assistance ``aimed at transforming and opening'' theeconomies of the two Soviet bloc countries.   Bush said, ``There have been some misconceptions (that) we wouldcome in here with a dollar package. I managed to convey in Polandthat that was not the case and here it is not the case.''   He said the communique ``vindicated'' his approach.   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, speaking of the sevensummit nations, said, ``We are all very anxious to help. We are allhelping each in our own way.''   The leaders reaffirmed their support for easing Poland's $39billion foreign debt burden by relaxing its payment schedule. WhiteHouse chief of staff John Sununu said this could provide Poland with$5 billion in relief.   The communique also urged the International Monetary Fund tospeed up consideration of new loans for Poland.   ``We welcome the process of reform under way in Poland andHungary,'' the statement said. ``We recognize that the politicalchanges taking place in these countries will be difficult to sustainwithout economic progress.''   Bush said, ``There seems to be a marvelous unanimity of opinionof how to treat these East European countries.''   Britain last month announced a $25 million aid package to Poland.The money is to be spread over five years for a ``know-how'' fund ontraining Poles to operate an entrepreneurial economy.   Moving beyond political issues, the leaders met today to discusseconomic problems and economic issues in a windowless room atop theGrand Arch, a 35-story avant-garde, cubic structure of glass andmarble that is France's newest national symbol _ and subject ofarchitectural controversy.   On China, the political communique urged the World Bank towithhold new loans and called on Beijing ``to cease action againstthose who have done no more than claim their legitimate rights todemocracy and liberty.''   The seven nations _ the United States, France, Britain, WestGermany, Italy, Canada and Japan _ all promised to shelter Chinesestudents who did not want to go home.   The leaders called on Chinese authorities ``to create conditionswhich will avoid their isolation'' and to resume earlier movestoward political and economic reforms in the world's largest nation.   On the Soviet Union, the seven democracies registered theirapproval of easing East-West tensions but said Moscow ``remains athreat to each of us'' with its continuing military balance favoringthe East.   The political statement also issued a fresh condemnation ofterrorism and vowed to bring terrorists to justice.   ``We call on those holding hostages to release them immediatelyand unconditionally and on those with influence over hostage-takersto use it to this end,'' the document said. There are 15 foreignhostages in Lebanon, including citizens of three summit countries,the United States, Britain and Italy.   The summit statement did not single out any country as a sponsorof terrorism.   The leaders underscored their support for international measuresto protect against aircraft hijackings and sabotage in the wake ofthe bombing of Pan Am flight 103 that killed 270 people inLockerbie, Scotland, last December.   ``We have agreed to give priority to preventing such attacks byfurther strengthening security measures,'' the statement said. ``Wehave also agreed on the need for improved methods of detectingexplosives.''   The meeting of the world's wealthiest industrial democracieslargest seven came amid a huge celebration of the 200th birthday ofthe French Revolution, a multimillion dollar gala that has beencriticized in the press here as overly extravagant and expensive.   Bush today offered high praise for the festivities, saying thepageant of parades, fireworks and parties was ``just magnificent,beautifully done, very special to all Americans.''   In the political declaration, the leaders said they were preparedto support reforms in Poland and Hungary and to consider ``in anappropriate fashion economic assistance aimed at transforming andopening their economies in a durable manner.''   The Big Seven countries said the aid should be designed ``tosustain the momentum of the reforms through inward investment, jointventures, transfer of managerial skills, professional training andother ventures which would help develop a more competitive economy.''   After opening their talks Friday evening, the leaders joined in ajoyous celebration of Bastille Day, the beginning of the FrenchRevolution.   The festivities began with a lavish dinner of lamb and sea perch.The leaders then stepped onto a balcony enclosed with bulletproofglass to watch a $15 million parade featuring, among otherattractions, the 250 musicians of the Florida Aandamp;M band, glidingbackwards in a Michael Jackson moonwalk down the Champs Elyseesbefore a crowd estimated at 1 million.   The evening concluded with a fireworks spectacular of red, whiteand blue rocket plumes _ the French colors.   While the leaders were smiling in public, there were sharpdifferences in private sessions over French President FrancoisMitterrand's attempts to arrange a meeting of wealthy and poornations to discuss the problems of Third World countries.   The United States and Britain firmly resisted Mitterrand'sproposal.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said the best approach to ThirdWorld problems was on a case-by-case basis rather than convening aninternational conference.   ``You don't get solutions to problems by bunching up areas andcalling them North and South,'' as the rich and poor nations areoften called, Brady said.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl took a middle-road approach.He said he had heard the complaints of poor nations and the demandsfor the Big Seven summit countries to open their markets to ThirdWorld products.   There also was an argument in the wings between Britain andFrance as the two sides, playing out old rivalries, sniped at eachother about everything from the significance of the FrenchRevolution to Mrs. Thatcher's right-wing politics.   In addition to urging consideration of poor nations' demands,Mitterrand emphasized the need to combat illegal drugs, saying hewas shocked by the effect the narcotics epidemic is having onyouths, according to French spokesman Hubert Vedrine.   Kohl urged his summit partners to adopt policies that would allowcontinued economic growth while reducing trade surpluses.   Even before the summit opened, the United States and Japan movedto cool trade tensions, which flared up this year after theadministration adopted a tough line targeting Japan as an unfairtrader because of barriers to the sale of American goods in Japan.   Japan originally reacted with outrage at being singled out, butboth sides adopted a more conciliatory attitude Friday after aprivate meeting between Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno.   The Japanese, reversing course, agreed to launch negotiationsaimed at removing barriers to sales of foreign goods.   Bush was less successful, however, at breaking a deadlock betweennegotiators trying to produce a debt-reduction plan for Mexico.   U.S. officials announced later that the administration would bewilling to extend an emergency loan of between $1 billion and $2billion to Mexico if the money would help break a deadlock incurrent negotiations between Mexico and the commercial banks thathold the bulk of its debt.</TEXT></DOC>
