Wrong.andP;  And that'swhy Go can become an addiction: Because it seems so easy.andP;  The fundamentalsare as easy as checkers, but true mastery of the game is more complex thanchess.andP;  Toyogo has come to the aid of befuddled beginners with Nemesis GoJunior, a simplified PC version of the game that teaches Go basics.andM;Go Junior ($35) is designed to teach novices the rules and the most importantelements of strategy.andP;  At the opening of the game you sketch out theterritory you hope to enclose.andP;  In the midgame, you attempt to simultaneouslydefend your own territory from invasion and attack your opponent's territory.andO;During the endgame, players haggle over remaining spaces until there are noprofitable moves left for either party.andM;To play an effective game of Go, you must visualize the entire board as youplan your own moves and try to anticipate your opponent's.andP;  Thestandard-sized board presents a daunting range of possibilities, so theprogrammers at Toyogo kindly provide a modest 9-by-9 grid, on which you canpractice until you're ready to graduate to an intermediate 13-by-13 board.andO;Once you have gained confidence at that higher level of complexity, you arefinally ready to graduate to Go Junior's standard 19-by-19 board.andP;  A&quot;Handicap&quot; option allows you to start with an advantage of up to nine stones.andM;Nemesis is your computergenerated opponent.andP;  Her default ability level (andthe strongest computer opposition you can face with Go Junior) is 13 kyu, arating that represents a moderately good player.andP;  You can decrease herstrength by selecting 20, 25, 30, or 35 kyu from the setup menu.andP;  (There'salso a setting that will let you play against a human opponent.) The manualadvises that you will learn the most by setting Nemesis to her strongestsetting and choosing an appropriate handicap and/or using a smaller boardsize.andM;I found this to be entirely true; when I set Nemesis to 35 kyu and gavemyself a seven-stone handicap, I beat the computer immediately.andP;  It took me aday or two, however, to beat her on the 9-by-9 board with only a two-stonehandicap.andM;Several other menu options facilitate learning and understanding, and allowyou to study the board when the game is over to see why you or lost.andP;  Thereis a &quot;grid labels&quot; feature that labels the grid numerically along one edgeand alphabetically along the other.andM;When you make a move, Nemesis's countermove is explained with a short tagline at the bottom of the screen; for instance, &quot;Defend E07-edge link.&quot; Whenyou ask Nemesis for a hint, the tag line may respond &quot;Try C02-Defend D03string.andP;  &quot; You then locate the C02 position on the grid and place your stonethere, thus defending your D03 string.andP;  While the meaning of many of the taglines is obvious or becomes self-explanatory as you play, there are a fewunfortunate exceptions.andM;For instance, I received an &quot;Endgame link attack&quot; message as an explanationfor Nemesis's move a number of times during the game, when things stillappeared to be very open.andP;  Well, Nemesis made her move, I countered (in thedark as to whether I was fending off this ominous-sounding &quot;Endgame&quot; thing),and the game proceeded.andP;  Sometimes I won, sometimes I lost.andP;  I would haveliked further details about what an &quot;Endgame link attack&quot; means, but the termisn't explained in any of the documentation, and there's no online glossary.andM;Go Junior supports virtually all video configurations, since it requires nographics support (ANSI.SYS is required on MDA systems).andP;  On CGA, EGA, or VGAsystems, the game displays a simple, attractive representation of the playingboard.andM;On the whole, Go Junior provides more than enough information, features, andoptions to keep you continuously challenged as you learn.andM;If you want to face a tougher adversary than Nemesis (and you won't, unlessyou're an experienced player or a genius), you'll have to upgrade to Toyogo'sGo Master program.andP;  Go Master sells for $79 and has optional tutorials thatteach the finer points of the game.andP;  I'll tell you about it next year.andM;List Price: Nemesis Go Junior, $35.andM;Requires: 512K RAM, DOS 2.1.andP;  No graphics adapter required; ANSI.SYS requiredfor text-mode operation.andP;  Toyogo Inc., 25460-M, Honolulu, HI 96825;800-869-6469.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
