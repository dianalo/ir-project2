House Republican Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., agreed. ``I think itwas quite successful, overall, but there were also some things wedidn't get that we would have liked.''   Many of the unresolved issues involve domestic policy fights,such as the minimum wage, family-related legislation, and cleaningup the nation's air.   The minimum wage has been $3.35 per hour since 1981, butDemocrats pushed in recent months for an increase, a drive theyhoped to turn into political gains during the election campaign.   The Democrats who control Congress succeeded in bringing to theSenate floor a bill that would have raised the minimum wage to$4.55 per hour over a three-year period, but Republicans said theywould filibuster unless the Judiciary Committee voted to approve 25of President Reagan's judicial appointments.   The Senate tried to cut off debate, but that move only picked up56 votes, four short of the 60 needed. That moved minimum wagelegislation to the back burner.   A look at some of the other unfinished items:</TEXT><TEXT>   CLEAN AIR _ The Senate considered a bill which would have triedto control acid rain by restricting smokestack emissions, alongwith tightening auto-emission standards and restricting the burningof toxic chemicals. But there was strong opposition in both theHouse and Senate, particularly from legislators representing statesproducing low-sulfur coal such as those in the Rocky Mountain area.   CHILD CARE _ The Senate Health and Labor Committee votedapproval in July of a bill providing $2.5 billion for child care,with 75 percent of that amount ticketed for low- andmoderate-income families. But opposition by a variety of groups,including the National Education Association and the NationalParent Teachers Association, stalled floor action. They wereopposed because some of the money would go to child-care centerssponsored by religious institutions.   PARENTAL LEAVE _ Democrats backed a proposal to requireemployers of 50 or more persons to give up to 10 weeks of unpaidparental and medical leave. Senate Republicans attached anamendment making child pornography a federal crime and Democratstried to strip that provision out of the bill, but failed.   IMPEACHMENT _ The House voted 413-3 on Aug. 3 to impeach U.S.District Court Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Florida for high crimesand misdemeanors, alleging perjury and conspiracy to receive abribe. The Senate later decided to postpone the impeachment trialuntil 1989.   The House also delayed impeachment proceedings against U.S.District Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr., of Mississippi. Nixon isserving a five-year prison term for perjury.   SOUTH AFRICA SANCTIONS _ On Aug. 11, the House voted 244-132approval of a bill to prohibit almost all trade with white-ruledSouth Africa. It would have also barred South African imports. TheSenate Foreign Relations Committee approved similar legislation,but filibuster threats blocked any floor action.   AIRLINE CONSUMER PROTECTION _ The House approved a billrequiring airlines to disclose information on flight delays andcompensation for workers hurt by mergers. The Senate passed asimilar bill, but a House-Senate conference committee called toresolve differences broke down in fighting over provisions for therandom testing of transportation industry employees.   CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM _ Senate Democrats backed a bill cappingthe amount senators could receive from political action committees.Republicans filibustered and there were eight unsuccessful votesattempting to halt the filibuster. During one procedural fight overthe filibuster, arrest warrants were issued for missing senatorsand Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore., was brought forcibly to theSenate floor.   NUCLEAR TREATIES _ Still awaiting action are a pair of treatiesnegotiated between the Soviet Union and United States more than adecade ago. They would restrict nuclear explosions to no more than150 kilotons. President Reagan had promised to push forratification if an improved method could be found to verify thepacts.</TEXT></DOC>
