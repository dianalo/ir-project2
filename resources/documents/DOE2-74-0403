For example, for a loss of coolantaccident at Sizewell B the estimate of the likelihood that radioactivitywould be released involves three numbers:- the frequency of loss of coolantfrom the reactor; how often the safety pumps which would have to workin case of a loss of coolant have failed when tested; and the chancethat the containment round the reactor will fail. As each risk numberis small, the combined risk is very small. Using the same method of assessmentthe risk of an accident affecting public safety at the liquid gas planton Canvey Island is 1000 larger, but still small and acceptable. Muchtime and money was spent on establishing the 1000 times lower risk ofan accident affecting public safety at the Sizewell reactor. The riskassessment was however, finally accepted. Fast reactors are even saferthan pressurised water reactors and use a renewable energy source; theirdevelopment is strongly advocated. It is noted that the risks from amedieval water-wheel were enormous compared with nuclear risks today.(U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
