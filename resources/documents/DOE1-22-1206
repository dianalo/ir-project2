<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-1206 </DOCNO><TEXT>A deuterium pellet injector built for the reversed field pinch Eta BetaII is described. The pellet gun is the versatile type developed at Riso.Pellets are small, 0.38 or 0.72 mm diam., and rather slow, 100 m/s. Theyare transported to Eta Beta II through a guide tube system, which theyleave with an angular spread below 1/sup 0/ and are then injected througha long radial tube. The pellets are detected by optical pellet detectorsthe signals from which are used to trigger the firing of Eta Beta II.The injector is operated automatically by means of a PLC.</TEXT></DOC>
