Mr. King, as he tells anyone who will listen, has been bold in his business -- electronics subcontracting -- and has invested millions of dollars in state-of-the-art technology for his company, SCI Systems Inc.    Yet, Mr. King admits, it often takes an old-fashioned browbeating by the boss to keep his business running smoothly.    &quot;Sometimes you get the facts better by arguing with people,&quot; explains SCI's chairman and co-founder as he gives a mock demonstration of his confrontational style. &quot;You can spend half the day going back and forth with an employee,&quot; he explains, &quot;or you can say . . . &quot; -- he grimaces menacingly, thrusts his face forward, much like a bulldog, and raises his voice &quot;why are you lying to me?'&quot;    Mr. King's features then relax, and his smile returns. &quot;You get to the core of it that way,&quot; he says placidly.    It takes a tough executive to succeed in the business of making parts for electronic giants such as International Business Machines Corp. Subcontracting, one of the most volatile parts of the electronics industry, is a rugged, cutthroat business in which companies' fortunes rest on paperthin profit margins and the success of their customers' products.    Despite such obstacles, SCI has flourished. The company's earnings increased an average of 35% a year to $13.8 million, or 67 cents a share (adjusted for stock splits), over the five fiscal years ended June 30, 1986. Revenue increased 51% annually in the same period to $470.2 million. Analysts estimate that SCI earned $15.9 million, or 77 cents a share, on revenue of about $550 million in fiscal 1987.    The figures make SCI the world's largest electronics subcontractor and have helped increase the price of its stock, which is traded over the counter. Yesterday, SCI shares closed at $22.375; the stock has increased more than twelvefold since mid-1980.    &quot;I came to Huntsville with $300 and a beat-up old Mercury,&quot; says Mr. King, whose SCI stockholdings are valued at an estimated $16 million. &quot;I have a little more than $300 today, so some people would call that a success story.&quot;    In creating that story, the 52-year-old Mr. King has emerged as one of the industry's most colorful and combative executives. A gracious host who charms Huntsville's influential citizens at lavish parties, he becomes a dogged street fighter when it comes to his business. Recently, for example, he led SCI through a bitter labor struggle, after which he settled charges that SCI fired union sympathizers.    &quot;His personal style is one of probing and attack,&quot; says James Daniel, SCI's chief financial officer.    But he can also be discreet, particularly when it comes to his largest customer, IBM. It is known that about 40% of SCI's revenue comes from IBM, and it is believed that SCI is IBM's largest subcontractor. Indeed, the relationship between the two companies is so cozy that SCI is building a factory near an IBM facility in Owego, N.Y. But neither company will give details of its relationship with the other.    Whatever is undisclosed, this much is known: SCI and other subcontractors form a vital but subterranean part of the computer business. These companies work fast and cheaply, unburdened by large bureaucracies, bloated budgets and well-crafted public-relations images that make paying low wages and laying off workers difficult for the computer giants themselves. For instance, SCI's hourly cost for blue-collar employees is less than $15, which includes overhead -- half the cost incurred by some computer makers.    The computer industry's subcontractors are split into two segments: hundreds of so-called garage shops, which largely solder circuit boards, and a handful of large companies like SCI that can afford sophisticated machinery and offer engineering services to their customers. But big or small, subcontractors do the same job: They deliver large volumes of high-quality products on time and at prices well below the manufacturing cost of their customers. This is especially important for circuit boards, which contain the machine's memory chips and are typically the most costly part of a personal computer.    It is hard to estimate the size of the industry because it primarily consists of small private concerns, many of which are victims of its roller-coaster fortunes. Steven Moxely, the president of SCI competitor Avco Electronics Textron, figures that eight of Avco's major competitors over the past two decades have closed. &quot;It's a very up-and-down business, and (companies) are always dropping out,&quot; he says.    Mr. King came to dominate the business in a roundabout way. The son of a fifth-generation Methodist minister, he was raised in rural Georgia and was expected to follow in his father's footsteps. But young Olin had another calling: engineering.    After graduate school and a stint at RCA Corp., Mr. King joined German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency in Huntsville. The year was 1956, and for the next five years Mr. King worked on the nation's first satellite program. Then, in 1961, he and some colleagues went out on their own, pooled $21,000 and launched Space Craft Inc., which later evolved into SCI, in the basement of Mr. King's home.    Space Craft Inc. initially made small satellites. However, it quickly switched direction when Mr. King discovered there was more money to be made by subcontracting work from companies holding contracts from the new Apollo space program and the military.    One bonus from the aerospace business was the acquired expertise in surface-mount technology, which has quickly become the industry standard in the personal-computer business and helped SCI strike gold during the personal-computer boom of the early 1980s. (Surface-mount technology helps make computers smaller by placing parts on both sides of the circuit boards.) Because the process is so expensive and time-consuming to implement, many computer makers turn to SCI.    The success of companies like SCI also depends on delivering parts in time to meet customers' production schedules. Consider the case of the swamp-bound circuit boards. In 1984, an SCI cargo plane ran out of fuel at 4 a.m. and plunged into the Florida Everglades on its way to what Mr. King secretively calls &quot;a big customer&quot; (probably IBM). Mr. King launched an operation that was almost military in its speed and complexity. He dispatched airboats to fetch the circuit boards, which were rushed to a Florida motel, where SCI technicians tested them for damage.    Meanwhile, Mr. King roused some of his slumbering workers, opened the company's Arab, Ala., plant and rented another plane. By 10 a.m., SCI delivered enough circuit boards from both the Florida swamp and Alabama to meet the customer's production schedule for that day.    SCI's rescue operation shows the lengths to which the company will go to please its customers, especially IBM. It isn't easy serving IBM, one of the most demanding customers in the subcontracting business. IBM, for example, samples 50 circuit boards out of every 270-board lot; if one is defective, every board in the lot is rejected.    &quot;They don't fool around,&quot; says Michael Connolly, a vice president and former IBM employee. &quot;If you don't do the job for them, they'll find someone else who can.&quot;    To do the job, SCI has assembled what analysts call a crack management team. President Eugene Sapp runs the company on a day-to-day basis, and he does so in a no-frills atmosphere. For example, company cars, planes and country-club memberships are taboo.    SCI is able to work quickly, Mr. King and Mr. Sapp say, because it allows its managers to make most of the decisions. Nevertheless, those managers are kept on a short leash. Mr. Sapp, for instance, approves any personnel changes (even a janitor in Scotland) and inspects travel requests daily. &quot;Because they know Gene is watching, that cuts down on abuse right off the bat,&quot; says Mr. King.    SCI's annual picnic provides another glimpse of SCI's top-management style. Every year, Mr. King hobnobs with his blue-collar employees and helps serve thousands of pounds of barbecued goat, chicken and pork. To add to the festive atmosphere, he even provides a dunking booth. But unbeknown to the workers, the carnival-style game isn't just for fun. Mr. King says that the dunking booth's victims, gleefully selected by SCI's workers, are often the least liked supervisors in the SCI factories; by scrutinizing the voting results, he spots morale problems and weeds out mediocre foremen.    &quot;It's like a mosaic,&quot; Mr. King says. &quot;One tile doesn't look like much, but a smart man puts all those tiles together and gets a mosaic of what's going on.&quot;    Even smart men, however, can have their enemies. Among Mr. King's are officials of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which has unsuccessfully tried to organize SCI's workers for more than three years.    When the union first tried to organize SCI's Huntsville-area workers, Mr. King and other SCI officials told employees that &quot;union people were criminals and outlaws from the North&quot; and &quot;part of the Mafia,&quot; according to affidavits from former SCI employees taken by a lawyer representing the National Labor Relations Board. In an unfair-labor-practices complaint, SCI was charged with illegally laying off in December 1985 about 250 workers who had union ties and intimidating other workers to prevent them from joining. Mr. King settled by paying back wages of $83,000 to a handful of workers without admitting guilt.    Denzil Chapman, an official of the electrical workers' union, says of Mr. King: &quot;He's the meanest employer I've come across in the U.S.&quot;    Mr. King dismisses such talk as union rabble-rousing. He concedes that the blue-collar wages he pays are low but contends that they are in line with similar jobs in the Huntsville area; he also says his workers get better medical and education benefits than their colleagues in other area plants. And he has no love for unions, he says, because he feels that the specter of strikes and slowdowns doesn't mix well with the subcontracting business. &quot;What would (a customer) think if he's not sure I'm going to be working tomorrow?&quot; he asks.    Mr. King's wrath is also felt by employees and business associates, who have frequently been on the wrong end of his powder-keg temper. Mr. King himself admits that he can be so intimidating at times that he stays clear of new employees for fear they will leave the company. &quot;He really likes to go right to the jugular vein,&quot; says Charles Gunselman, a vice president.    One target has been the press. In 1983, he railed against the local newspaper for reprinting a Los Angeles Times article that questioned whether Huntsville's blue-collar workers were fairly sharing in the area's high-tech boom. In a full-page ad, Mr. King chastised the Huntsville paper's publisher and charged that the reporter fabricated quotes and was a &quot;New York liberal&quot; with &quot;a bias against Alabama.&quot;    His intensity as a businessman, however, sometimes spills over into his private life. &quot;I work hard and I play hard,&quot; Mr. King says. &quot;He throws the best parties in town,&quot; adds Joe M. Hinds Jr., the chairman of First Alabama Bank of Huntsville. The annual Christmas party given by Mr. King and his wife, Shelby, at their antebellum mansion is the talk of the town. (The short and portly Mr. King has also been known to arrive at formal dinner parties disguised as a gorilla and an aging hippie.)    Still, work and his company ultimately come first. Jewel Halsey, a friend, bluntly calls Mr. King &quot;a workaholic.&quot; When Mrs. Halsey asks Mr. King to attend a dinner party, she says, he will insist on arriving precisely when the meal is served so he can get more work done at the office -- and he will often return to work before coffee is served. By his own account, Mr. King works about 75 hours a week, down from 100-hour workweeks in his younger days.    &quot;I've had one company and two wives and that ought to tell you something,&quot; Mr. King says. </TEXT></DOC>
