Suspicious of the procedure, the Ellicott City, Md., womancomplained earlier this year to GE, a company she knew well. Hergrandfather, father and husband had worked there.   She didn't receive what she considered a satisfactory response.   Thus began a chain of events that led Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn.,to announce a landmark arrangement Wednesday in which one of thebest-known corporations in America agreed to keep up to 300,000pounds of ozone-depleting freon from the marketplace.   ``Hi, I'm the person that exposed GE emitting CFCs in mykitchen, across the country and probably the world,'' Ms. Drapersaid, introducing herself at a news conference called by Gore, whonegotiated the agreement.   CFC is the abbreviation for chlorofluorocarbons.   The company agreed, according to Gore and GE spokesman JimAllen, to offset whatever amount of freon is released as part of aprogram to replace faulty refrigerator compressors.   Ms. Draper said she was ``totally outraged'' at the freonrelease, and contacted the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Theenvironmental lobbying and research organization contacted Gore,who has introduced legislation to ban CFCs.   Gore agreed to negotiate with the company.   The freon releases began in January, when GE began repairing thecompressors in large-size refrigerators sold in 1987 and 1988. Thework should be completed by year's end.   Gore estimated the 5 ounces of the gas released from eachservice call could total 300,000 pounds by the time the programends.   The arrangement, Gore said, was ``breaking new ground,'' becauseit would mean ``real reductions in the volume of CFCs now beingreleased into our air.''   Allen, a spokesman for GE's appliance division in Louisville,Ky., said he expected the offset would take place next year.   GE, Allen said, hadn't decided exactly how to offset thereleases, but that the company has pledged to ``take off themarketplace the amount we use in the (replacement) program.''   While ozone is the chief ingredient of smog when close to theground, it protects against ultraviolet radiation at higher levels.If a hole in the ozone layer develops and increased radiation comesthrough, it could cause more skin cancer, cataracts, depressedhuman immune systems and reduced crop yields, according toscientists and the Environmental Protection Agency.   CFCs also have been implicated in global warming, in which theearth's heat is trapped, causing temperature increases, droughts,heat waves and a rise in sea levels.   Gore and William Walsh, of the U.S. Public Interest ResearchGroup, contended GE could have done more by using special equipmentto recapture the freon during repairs instead of releasing it intothe atmosphere.   Allen said portable machines that could immediately recapturethe freon are not widely available and are unable to recycle thegas during the repair process.</TEXT></DOC>
