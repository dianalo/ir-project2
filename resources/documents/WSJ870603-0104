The move was seen mostly as a tactical ploy to protect Republicans from being branded as anti-reform. But the action makes it less likely that Democrats will be able to find the handful of GOP votes they need to clear the way for passage of a public financing bill.    Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) had hoped to bring the public-funding bill to the Senate floor for a vote this month, but sponsors concede they are still several votes shy of the 60 they need to cut off a filibuster promised by Republican opponents.    Sponsors of the anti-PAC proposal included eight GOP senators who ran in 1986, collecting $6.9 million from PACs in the process. Currently, a PAC can give $5,000 per candidate, per election. The GOP plan would cut that to zero. But it was offered without much fervor. &quot;We don't have any overwhelming problem with PACs,&quot; said Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), &quot;but it seems to me that PACs have become the issue.&quot; He said he would filibuster against public financing.    Sen. Robert Packwood (R., Ore.), who got $966,759 from PACs in his 1986 reelection campaign, also sponsored the PAC-ban bill, a disappointment to Democrats who had hoped to enlist his support for public funding.    Republicans had briefed some of their PAC benefactors beforehand about the plan to propose a ban. One PAC director said he took the GOP move as nothing more than a tactical maneuver to block public financing, but argued against it anyway. &quot;I said, what are you going to do if Bob Byrd says, 'Shoot, this is a good idea'?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
