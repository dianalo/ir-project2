Hubbard lost by anose in his bid to gain enough shareholder consents forcontrol of Hollywood Park Operating Co., making it probablethat the bitter battle for the race track will last throughnext month's annual meeting.   The results are preliminary and can still be contestedwith election officials in Delaware through the close ofbusiness tomorrow.</LP><TEXT>   Assuming the tally holds, however, it is a testament tothe remarkable staying power of Hollywood Park's incumbentchairman, Marjorie L. Everett, who is determined to hang onto the reins at the thoroughbred track she has managed fornearly 20 years. It is also something of an embarrassment forMr. Hubbard, a Texas glassmaking tycoon who had assumed heknocked out Mrs. Everett through the solicitation of consentsand thereby avoided the continued expense of a full proxycontest.   Nonetheless, Mr. Hubbard's camp claimed its own victory onFriday. U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson rejected HollywoodPark's claims that Mr. Hubbard and two dissidents on theboard, Harry Ornest and Thomas Gamel, have clandestinelyacted in concert to acquire control of Hollywood Park. Hadthe judge found otherwise, Mr. Hubbard would have beenblocked from soliciting proxies until the group status of thethree men was correctly reported to the Securities andExchange Commission.   Most importantly, with the combined 25%-plus stake thethree men hold in Hollywood Park, it could have triggered thecompany's poison pill anti-takeover defense. &quot;What we won incourt today is huge,&quot; said one Hubbard backer. &quot;Theconspiracy charge is out the window.&quot;   Hollywood Park Operating's shares closed Friday innational over-the-counter trading, where they are paired withthose of sister concern Hollywood Park Realty EnterprisesInc., at $32.75, down $2.25.   Last week, Mr. Hubbard delivered 2,046,000 consents to theelection authorities, representing the support of a majorityof the company's shares outstanding, and even published anadvertisement in the Los Angeles Times all but declaringhimself the new chief executive officer of Hollywood Park.&quot;The stockholders have spoken,&quot; the ad said, as it purportedto introduce Mr. Hubbard and the other 10 &quot;new directors&quot;from his slate.   But the rhapsodizing proved premature. Mrs. Everett's sidecame up with 85,822 valid revocations, leaving Mr. Hubbardwith consents constituting but 49.38% of Hollywood Park's3,968,844 shares outstanding.   Judge Wilson admonished Mr. Hubbard for the improvidenceof the ad and enjoined him from issuing any other statementsthat make it appear the result of a consent or proxy fight isfinal until the result is certified. The judge also said thatby making it look as if the election of his slate was &quot;a faitaccompli,&quot; Mr. Hubbard may have done &quot;irreparable harm&quot; and&quot;tainted&quot; proxies sent in after the ad ran last Wednesday.The judge indicated he may take further action to correct thesituation.   Mrs. Everett, reached at her home, declined to comment onthe developments. But a Hollywood Park lawyer, RobertFairbank, called the counting of the consents and therestraining order on the ad a &quot;double win.&quot;   For his part, Mr. Hubbard asked the Hollywood Park board&quot;to work with him to bring the proxy contest to a rapidconclusion.&quot; He added, however, that he was &quot;fully preparedto continue&quot; the struggle through the Feb. 18 annual meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
