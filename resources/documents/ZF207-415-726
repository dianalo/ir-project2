Temperature sensibility may range to 6,500 degreesF for such applications as vacuum furnaces, induction heating,welding and semiconductor manufacturing.andP;  The main debits of theIR thermometer technology are limited IR wavelength range of 1 to2.5 microns and need precise placement.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     CalorimetryTemperatureSystem DesignThermal DevicesFiber OpticsApplications.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Conventional IR thermometry combines lens, detector, andamplifier.
