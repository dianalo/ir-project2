Hezbollah after all is the outfit that blew up 241U.S. Marines in Beirut in 1983 and tortured American hostagesin Lebanon for seven years. The U.S. government, however,issued an embarrassed general condemnation of &quot;the cycle ofviolence.&quot;   The condemnation was embarrassed because, by killingMusawi, the Israelis demolished the Reagan and Bushadministrations' main excuse for their policy of appeasingterrorist groups and governments: namely, that U.S.intelligence could not identify or locate the individualsresponsible for terrorist violence against Americans.</LP><TEXT>   The Israeli spy network has been largely at the CentralIntelligence Agency's disposal. Its strength lies not so muchin its deep penetration of terrorist hierarchies as in a verywide net of Lebanese who report what &quot;everyone&quot; in certaincircles knows. The National Security Agency's antennas canpick up a significant percentage of telecommunications inLebanon. So, as the CIA reported to Congress throughout theperiod in which U.S. hostages were held in Lebanon, everycouple of months a combination of these sources would providemutually confirming reports that the hostages were in a givensector or city block of West Beirut, or that a leadingterrorist personage would hold court in a given villa onFriday and take the main road to the Bekaa valley the dayafter.   Certainly such information was not specific enough toguarantee that a specific building would contain hostages ora specific car would contain a given chieftain. But thereason such information proved useless has nothing to do withits specificity or reliability, and everything to do with theU.S. government's decision not to do, ask for or even permitany act against terrorist forces in the region.   When the will to act is strong, even highly unspecificinformation will do. Italian terrorists kidnapped U.S. ArmyGeneral James Dozier in December 1981. The Italianauthorities knew only that Gen. Dozier was being held in thecity of Verona. That was enough. They sealed off the city,searched it systematically and interrogated every knownleftist. There was no doubt they would find the general andhis captors -- and they soon did. If between 1981 and 1985,the U.S. had been willing to send helicopter-borne troops tosurround a city block in Beirut, the information available onthe whereabouts of the hostages would have been more thansufficient to free them.   By the same token, the information available to the U.S.was more than enough to identify, not the meaninglesstrigger-pullers, but the individuals ultimately responsiblefor anti-American terrorism in Lebanon -- above all, Syria'sdictator, Hafez Assad. No secret intelligence, but onlyintelligence of the ordinary kind, sufficed to hold himpersonally responsible for every day our hostages spentchained to walls and for every kick they received. Policy,not lack of information, kept two Republican administrationsfrom telling Mr. Assad, &quot;our hostages alive and their captorshanded over to us, or you dead.&quot;   And certainly the U.S. had adequate information on whichto send bombers, helicopters or highly accurate Tomahawkcruise missiles to kill Hezbollah's guru, Sheik MohammedHussein Fadlallah, Sheik Musawi and their like, within theirwalled villas or on their armed motorcades. Not every sortiewould have killed a terrorist bigwig, but every explosionwould have blown a hole in the terrorist organization, warnedordinary people that consorting with terrorists is unsafe,and increased the survivors' sense that being nasty to theUnited States of America has no future. Much as the chiefs ofthe Shiite terrorist organizations preach martyrdom, theytake pains not to practice it.   But the U.S. government did not want these people dead.For better or for worse, U.S. policy consistently has beenthat, to gain influence in the Arab world, America mustaccommodate one or more powerful Arab states, even thoughthey sponsor terrorism. Thus, between 1981 and 1989 the U.S.chose to build up Saddam Hussein -- during the final week ofthe Gulf War, President Bush even turned down a request froman air force commander who had located Saddam to kill him.   Since 1982, the U.S. has chosen to build up Mr. Assad. Farfrom using intelligence to inconvenience him, the Bushadministration in late 1990 gave him agent information givento us by Israel, trusting that Mr. Assad would use it tothwart plans by Syria-based terrorists to kill the U.S.ambassador to Jordan. Instead, Mr. Assad told the terrorists,who tracked down and killed the Israeli agents who hadinfiltrated them. This did not keep President Bush frompaying a higher price yet for Hafez Assad's friendship: U.S.acquiescence in Syria's annexation of Lebanon, and ananti-Israel tilt in U.S. foreign policy.   One may debate whether or not the policy of making dealswith terrorist chieftains while shooting only at underlingswas wise. But it was surely not dictated by any lack ofintelligence. While there was not enough evidence to defendagainst the trigger-pullers, there certainly was enough totake action against their chiefs. Unfortunately, there isnever enough information to make up for weak leadership.   The fact that the Bush administration has deploredIsrael's killing of Musawi shows that it is not ready tochange its basic policy. But the fact that its condemnationis &quot;sotto voce&quot; shows that, perhaps, the administration mightbe just a little bit ashamed. That would be progress.   ---   Mr. Codevilla, a fellow at the Hoover Institution, servedeight years on the staff of the Senate IntelligenceCommittee.
