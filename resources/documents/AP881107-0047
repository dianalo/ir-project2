One guerrilla leader says some fighters have acquiredsatellite-guided U.S. mortars but supplies are limited and some ofthe weapons were destroyed by Soviet bombings.   Soviet-Afghan forces defending Kandahar, the country'ssecond-largest city 300 miles southwest of the capital Kabul, bombedthe area in the past week with newly introduced Soviet MiG-27 jets,the guerrillas said.   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported the Afghan armykilled more than 300 guerrillas near Kandahar and other areas fromFriday through Sunday.   State-run Radio Kabul, monitored in London, reported thatguerrilla attacks killed 33 people in the same period, including 30it said died when a missile hit a bus near Kandahar.   The Soviets said last week that they have suspended their troopwithdrawal from Afghanistan and have sent advanced weapons to theirsouthern neighbor because of unrelenting pressure from theanti-communist guerrillas known as the mujahedeen, or Islamic holywarriors.   Among weaponry newly introduced in Kabul are SS-1 Scud missiles,which are capable of reaching Pakistan, 120 miles away.    U.S.-supplied anti-aircraft Stinger missiles that once sentSoviet fighter jets fleeing to higher altitudes are in short supplyand jealously hoarded, said guerrillas in the Kandahar area.   ``The air is the only trouble for mujahedeen,'' not militaryinstallations on the ground, said Abdul Wali, a guerrilla commanderin the area.   Kandahar sits in the middle of an arid plain that offers littleprotection from marauding aircraft that have leveled the city'ssouthern suburb of Mahalajat.   The MiG-27s, first supplied by Moscow around Oct. 23, drop theirbombs without decoy flares, used before a raid to fool heat-seekingmissiles.   ``They must know they have nothing to fear anymore,'' said aWestern diplomat in Islamabad, Pakistan, who spoke on condition henot be identified.   Gul Lalai, a guerrilla commander, said he examinedsatellite-guided mortars at a base south of Kandahar and run by thehard-line Hezb-e-Islami guerrilla group.   Non-guerrilla sources in Pakistan have also confirmed thefour-barrel, 120mm weapons were supplied to the insurgents.   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, who heads the Hezb-e-Islami, has deniedreceiving any foreign aid and the United States has refused topublicly acknowledge the weapons' existence in Afghanistan.   Guerrillas who used their limited technological expertise todescribe the mortar, said a satellite acts as a spotter, sendingcoordinates to the launcher, which is equipped with a screen and asmall receiver.   Mujahedeen fighters fire two rockets in the direction of thetarget, and the satellite does the mathematical equation that locksit in. There was no word on the mortar's range.   However, the insurgents say supplies are limited and two of themortars were destroyed when the MiG-27s blasted rebel positions eastof Kandahar airport late last month.   In the latest fighting, guerrillas reported heavy bombing aroundKandahar during the past week that killed at least nine people andinjured 80.   Tass reported that guerrillas on Sunday fired three rockets intoKabul but did not say if there were any casualties.   It said that over the weekend the Afghan army killed 153guerrillas in fighting around Kandahar and in the settlements ofTur-Kotal and Sarpuza. It said troops attacked an ``armed gang'' inZabol province, killing 150 guerrillas and wounding 52 people,including a Pakistani adviser.   Under terms of the U.N.-mediated Geneva accords reached in April,the Soviets agreed to withdraw the estimated 100,000 troops it sentinto Afghanistan since 1979 to help the Moscow-backed Kabulgovernment fight off the guerrillas. About half the troops have beenpulled out.   But on Friday, Moscow said it halted the second half of thepullout that was to be completed by Feb. 15.</TEXT></DOC>
