Financial buyers, including leveraged buy-out specialists such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. as well as traditional corporate raiders, are dominating the new string of bids, a phenomenon that Wall Street merger professionals expect to continue through the fall. With worries about an overall economic decline abating and a stable stock market at their backs, investment bankers are betting a wave of $25 billion or more in money targeted for buy-outs will create a robust takeover business through year end.    Among groups contemplating fall acquisitions, &quot;we're seeing many more financial buyers,&quot; says Eric Gleacher, Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.'s merger chief. &quot;They've got the proverbial money burning holes in their pockets. And if they can finance a deal going in, their one risk is an economic drop-off.&quot;    Adds Langhorne Reid, co-head of mergers at PaineWebber Inc.: &quot;There is a wall of money that has to be invested. Everybody has waited a long time for some kind of economic chaos, and it kind of persists in not happening. The environment looks very good.&quot;    For the first time since the spring, Wall Street's merger community is awash in reports of forthcoming deals, both real and imagined. One of the best bets to attempt a fall takeover is Chicago investor William Farley, who is said to be readying a $3 billion hostile offer. Speculation on the target's identity centers on VF Corp., maker of Wrangler and Lee jeans; James River Corp., a paper company, and West Point-Pepperell Inc., in which Mr. Farley may already have accumulated a small stake.    Elsewhere, a partnership controlled by investor Bennett LeBow says it may bid for American Brands Inc., which has a market value of more than $5.3 billion. New York investor Ronald O. Perelman is preparing a takeover attempt of a major U.S. or British concern to be launched by year end. Perhaps most intriguing are rumblings in the investment banking community of a $15 billion-to-$20 billion megadeal coming in the next three weeks.    Nobody, however, expects the merger business to return soon to the frenzied pace of 1988's first quarter, when three months of pent-up demand following the stock market crash burst forth in an orgy of acquisitions. Since April, the takeover community has languished in a collective hangover, as high acquisition premiums scared off many potential buyers.    Merger professionals had been predicting for months that acquisition activity would pick up after Labor Day. &quot;The summer slows are over now,&quot; says PaineWebber's Mr. Reid. &quot;There really is something to that. Everybody's mind wanders in the summer.&quot;    Two factors, however, should combine to keep the takeover cauldron from boiling over. The first quarter's spree helped boost acquisition premiums to levels that scared off many suitors -- high enough that most corporate buyers have remained on the sidelines ever since. The few corporate buyers pondering takeovers this fall are looking for strategic combinations to enlarge existing businesses rather than risking diversification moves, investment bankers say.    &quot;Things are still awfully pricey,&quot; said Willard Overlock, merger chief at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.. &quot;We see activity as strong, though not as strong as the first part of the year.&quot;    Just as important, all the hubbub about the &quot;Dukakis factor&quot; spawning a new wave of merger mania has diminished as Wall Street professionals bet that Vice President George Bush will ascend to the presidency in January. Previously, investment bankers reasoned that the specter of a win by Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis -- and accompanying speculation of a tighter antitrust environment -- would spur corporate executives to finish acquisitions before January.    &quot;The conventional wisdom on the Street is Bush is going to take it,&quot; says Don Carter, a leading proxy solicitor. &quot;The takeover climate is much calmer now than when Dukakis was leading (in polls) by 18 points.&quot;    One of the new takeover season's biggest surprises is the dominance among takeover advisers of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment firm recently accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission with a variety of securities-law violations, including insider trading. Its vaunted junk-bond apparatus apparently unaffected by the SEC charges, Drexel is financing the two largest current hostile tender offers, the Rales brothers' $2.47 billion bid for Interco Inc., and Shamrock Holdings Inc.'s $2.4 billion offer for Polaroid Corp. It's backing KKR's $2.36 billion buy-out offer for Macmillan Inc. and is in talks to help finance KKR's $4.64 billion unsolicited offer for Kroger Co. Drexel would probably also finance any hostile bids by Mr. LeBow or Mr. Perelman. &quot;Stay tuned,&quot; one Drexel investment banker says. &quot;There's more deals coming.&quot;    ---              Big Deals Brewing Since Labor Day    -- Kohlberg Kravis Roberts lodges an unsolicited $4.64 billion bid for Kroger Co., a day after the Haft family proposes a $4.36 billion takeover.    -- Hospital Corp. of America executives disclose talks aimed at a $3.33 billion leveraged buy-out.    -- Kohlberg Kravis Roberts agrees to acquire Macmillan Inc. for $2.36 billion. But spurned suitor Robert Maxwell bids $2.51 billion, apparently topping the KKR pact.    -- New York investor Bennett LeBow signals his &quot;willingness&quot; to launch a hostile bid of $5.3 billion for American Brands Inc. American Brands says it will vigorously oppose any such bid.    -- Ames Department Stores buys Zayre Corp.'s ailing department stores division for $800 million.</TEXT></DOC>
