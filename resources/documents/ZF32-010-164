 SOFTWARE INDUSTRY: URGES GOVERNMENT TO FOSTER INTERNATIONALandM;COMPETITIVENESandM;In testimony last Wednesday before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science,and Transportation, representatives of the U.S.andP;  software industry urged thefederal government to do all it can to be sure the industry can maintain itsinternational competitive advantage.andM;The PC software industry is widely recognized as one of the most viablesegments of the broader U.S.andP;  high technology industry.andP;  &quot;The softwareindustry operates in a fiercely, competitive, rapidly changing technologicalenvironment,&quot; stated Bill Neukom, vice president of Law and Corporate Affairsfor the Microsoft Corporation and a member of both the Software PublishersAssociation (SPA) and the Business Software Alliance (BSA).andM;&quot;We in industry are taking steps to be sure we retain our world leadershipposition, but we cannot do it alone.andP;  The government has a critical role toplay by implementing policies and practices which acknowledge and accomodatethe commercial realities of our industry.&quot;andP;  Among the important topics airedduring testimony were restrictions on the mass marketing of software withencryption capabilities and worldwide pirating of U.S.andP;  software.andM;Among the suggestions for government action was a recommendation to treatmass market personal computer software with encryption capabilities ascommercial exports, not as &quot;munitions.&quot;andP;  The SPA actively opposes thetreatment of mass market software as munitions because it poses a seriousthreat to the legitimate export of PC software.andP;  &quot;The software industry is akey contributor to the positive balance of trade, and export of theseproducts does not harm national security,&quot; said Ken Wasch, executive directorof the SPA.andM;Under current export law, mass market software is classified as &quot;munitions&quot;and is controlled by the Department of Defense.andP;  This means that thissoftware must be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Departments of Stateand Defense and requires individual export licenses.andP;  With some 50 percent ofthe revenue of leading software companies coming from overseas sales, theclassification as &quot;munitions&quot; and the tedious procedure it requires hindersthe ability to sell U.S.andP;  products overseas.andM;The U.S.andP;  Government is concerned that this software will be used bydangerous groups abroad and will make U.S.andP;  intelligence gathering moredifficult.andP;  The SPA believes this argument only makes sense if programs soldin the U.S.andP;  remain in the U.S.andP;  But with today's advanced technology, thatis not the case.andP;  It is easy enough to leave the country with a floppy disk;easier still to transmit a document abroad via modem and telephone line.andO;Once abroad, &quot;pirated&quot; copies proliferate.andP;  Preventing American companiesfrom exporting software in a timely, cost effective manner does not preventaccess to this software, but it does encourage foreign piracy.andM;Each year, the software industry loses $10-$12 billion in worldwide revenuesdue to the piracy of its products.andP;  &quot;There are foreign `competitors' whotoday threaten our continued financial performance and economic vitality,&quot;said Neukom.andP;  &quot;These `competitors' are the international pirates --individuals and companies abroad who simply copy and sell or use oursoftware.&quot;andM;&quot;Software piracy -- the theft of software through unauthorized copying -- isrampant worldwide,&quot; said Robert Holleyman, managing director of the BSA.andP;  &quot;Inmany areas, the pervasive spread of illegal copies has achieved deeper marketpenetration than the original products and is close to wiping out thelegitimate industry.andP;  Unless piracy is stopped, it will block the futuregrowth of American software companies.andP;  The U.S.andP;  government should use allpossible means to ensure that our trading partners enact and enforce strongcopyright laws.&quot;andM;The Software Publishers Association is the principal trade group of the PCsoftware industry.andP;  Its over 800 members represent the leading publishers inthe business, consumer and education markets, including the members of theBusiness Software Alliance.andM;The Business Software Alliance (BSA) is a coalition of software publisherswhich was organized in 1988 to combat software piracy in overseas markets.andO;The members of the BSA include Aldus, Ashton-Tate, Autodesk, DigitalResearch, Lotus Development, Microsoft, Novell and WordPerfect.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
