Disclosure of offenses to be prosecuted, made in telephoneinterviews this week, marked the first mention of specificobjectives for new task forces in six cities formed by AttorneyGeneral Dick Thornburgh last month.   The Justice Department is spending $2 million to hire prosecutorsfor the fraud patrols, the first permanent structured assault onfinancial corruption in a decade of highly publicized Wall Streetcrimes. They will be based in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, SanFrancisco, Denver and Kansas City, Mo.   ``The cases are out here to be done but everybody thinks the onlyplace you get prosecutions for these things is the Southern Districtof New York,'' said Irving Einhorn, regional administrator for theSecurities and Exchange Commission in Los Angeles.   The task forces were first proposed in 1987 by former U.S.Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani in New York, who secured 50 convictionsin his five-year term and a reputation for strong-arm tactics inwhite-collar prosecutions.   The task forces are expected to employ one highly criticizedGiuliani tactic: using the threat of federal racketeering laws toextract cooperation from securities fraud targets.   The investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. recently agreedto pay $650 million to settle criminal securities fraud violations,but said it did so to avoid a seizure of assets under theRacketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, known asRICO. The task forces even have been dubbed ``The Six RICOteers.''   U.S. attorneys' offices in the six cities are hiring 15prosecutors and arranging permanent help from the FBI, SEC,Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Internal Revenue Service andother agencies.   One task force already has begun an investigation, according to aprogress report submitted to Thornburgh's office last week, saidDavid Runkel, a spokesman for the attorney general. He declined toelaborate.   Investigators said New York cases that have been ignored will getattention with the addition of six prosecutors. Fraud in pennystocks _ inexpensive high-risk stocks traded over the counter _ alsowill face intense scrutiny.   ``I have specific cases that would be, could be, should beprosecuted that are only not being prosecuted because there isn'tsomeone to assign to them,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney BruceBaird, who heads New York's securities fraud division.   In Los Angeles, a probe of ``boiler-room'' telemarketing scamsresulting in 300 indictments in three years has steered resourcesfrom other white-collar crimes. The office obtained its firstinsider trading indictment just last week.   Look for prosecutions of insider trading, stock manipulation andpenny stock fraud under the new task force, Assistant U.S. AttorneyTerree Bowers said.   ``We're still limited in resoures. Sometimes I feel like I'mfighting the battle of the Alamo again,'' said Bowers, who heads themajor fraud division in Los Angeles and is getting three moreprosecutors.   Added the SEC's Einhorn: ``The epidemic is in penny stock fraud,little manipulations, the fly-by-night operations preying on smallinvestors that take the money and run and then disappear.''   In the other cities:   _San Francisco, home to the Pacific Stock Exchange, is gettingone prosecutor. U.S. Attorney Joseph P. Russoniello said fraudopportunities are ripe in public offerings by new high-techcompaniesand in real estate.   _Chicago, deep into probes of its two commodities markets, theChicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, will getthree prosecutors to target cases on hold, said Executive AssistantU.S. Attorney Daniel Gillogly.   _Denver is getting an extra prosecutor to focus on penny stockfirms, historically concentrated there because of its oil and miningbusinesses.   _Kansas City has a small commodities market with 259 memberstrading in wheat and stock-index futures. That market isn't underinvestigation but U.S. Attorney Robert G. Ulrich said he's receivedcomplaints of stockbroker abuse.   The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, which notched more than 20securities fraud indictments last year, is considered the model forthe task forces. The number of securities prosecutors there hasgrown from three in 1983 to 14 today, and other agencies havesupplied help.   ``The federal government had not been vigilant enough to create adeterrent in that time. They didn't know the level of the problem,''said Giuliani.   The effort is seen as important because there is no singlefederal agency with jurisdiction to investigate criminal securitiesfraud. The SEC can bring only civil charges while the IRS has bothcivil and criminal powers.   Permanently assigning attorneys to securities fraud cases willcreate financial crimebusters outside New York, officials said.   ``There's always been a large body of experts in the U.S.attorney's office in the Southern District of New York,'' said SECEnforcement Director Gary Lynch. ``The fact that there will bepeople designated in other offices means they're going to bedeveloping similar expertise.''</TEXT></DOC>
