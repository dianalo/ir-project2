The announcement will address a major drawback of Unix. The system lacks wide acceptance for business applications partly because it doesn't offer the graphical ease-of-use of popular systems such as that which runs on Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh personal computers. But while consultants said they have seen a prototype of ATandamp;T's program, called a &quot;graphical user interface,&quot; some industry executives called it &quot;vaporware,&quot; a term for a promised, but incompletely developed program.    The program may also spark legal interest from Apple, which has already sued Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. for infringing on certain Apple copyrights related to the audio-visual &quot;look-and-feel&quot; of its Macintosh computers. &quot;There is a possibility Apple will see something similar in this Unix thing they can sue on,&quot; said Steve Smith of PaineWebber Inc. Other analysts said, however, this isn't a strong possibility.    Industry executives said they understood that ATandamp;T's partner in promoting Unix, Sun Microsystems Inc., has done most of the development on the software program, but is letting ATandamp;T host the news conference here Monday in a show of unity.    ATandamp;T said top Sun officials plan to attend its news conference as well as top officials who were invited from at least two applications software houses, Ashton-Tate Co., Torrance, Calif. and Lotus Development Corp., Cambridge, Mass. ATandamp;T wants the software companies to indicate how they may adapt their popular business software programs to Unix, analysts and consultants said.    It isn't clear just how much support ATandamp;T and Sun are getting from the software companies. Industry sources said that top officials of Microsoft were also invited. But as of last night, the Microsoft officials weren't planning to attend, an ATandamp;T spokeswoman said. She indicated that could change over the weekend. &quot;There is a lot of churn,&quot; she said.    The user interface is supposed to make Unix easier to use as well as make it easier for the software houses to adapt their existing programs to Unix.    Unix support, or lack of it, by software houses is important. The drive by Sun and ATandamp;T to unify the many existing versions of Unix will be of little avail without useful applications software to induce customers to buy Unix computers. One industry source said Sun may be investigating the establishment of a partly owned outside software company to write such applications. ATandamp;T and Sun won't complete work on their most unified Unix version until the third quarter of 1989.    Although the user interface and unification drive by ATandamp;T and Sun should help Unix become better established, analysts said software houses still have the dilemma of deciding which microprocessor to base their programs on. Sun has been trying to persuade the industry to adopt its Sparc microprocesser as the &quot;standard&quot; Unix processor.    &quot;I still don't think Unix will dominate&quot; the computer industry, said Richard A. Shaffer, publisher of the Technologic Computer Letter. But Monday's announcements &quot;will keep Unix on the desktop and Unix could become one of three, maybe four, important operating systems.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
