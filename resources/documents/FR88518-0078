PurposeThe mutual goals of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the UnitedStates of America and the State Administration of Imort and Export CommodityInspection of the People's Republic of China (hereinafter known as theSACI) in entering into this Memorandum of Understanding are to:1. Establish certification requirements for ceramicware intended for usein the preparation, serving or storage of food exported directly to theUnited States or via Hong Kong from the People's Republic of China, inorder to assure that ceramicware having an unsafe quantity of leachablelead or cadmium will not be exported to the United States.2. Minimize the need for extensive FDA audit sampling of these food relatedproducts from the People's Republic of China certified by the various Provincialor Municipal China Import and Export Commodity Inspection Bureaus (hereinafterknown as CCIBs') that would be necessary without this Memorandum of Understanding.II. DefinitionsFor the purposes of this Memorandum, both parties agree to the followingdefinitions:<T3>Production Lot_</T3>A production lot is a unit of ceramicware whichthe CCIBs' certify to be uniform and that represents ceramicware from nomore than one homogeneously milled slip. The lot must be uniform in thetime and temperature of firing and the composition and application of thedecorations.<T3>Delivery Lot</T3>_A delivery lot is a unit of ceramicware, shippedat one time, consisting of a production lot or several production lots.It is packaged in containers/cartons that identify each production lotseparately and bear the name and address of the manufacturer.<T3>Sample</T3>_A sample is six units, randomly selected, of identicalsize, shape, color and decoration from each production lot.<T3>Flatware</T3>_Flatware are ceramic articles that have an internal depth,as measured from the lowest point to the horizontal plane passing throughthe upper rim, that does not exceed 25 mm.<T3>Hollowware</T3>_Hollowware products are ceramic articles having aninternal depth, as measured from the lowest point to the horizontal planepassing through the upper rim, greater than 25 mm. The two sizes of hollowwareare:<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Small holloware:</T3> a capacity of less than 1.1. liter; and,<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>Large hollowware:</T3> a capacity of 1.1 liter or more.<T3>Action level</T3>_The limit above which FDA will take legal actionto remove products from the market.III. Substance of Agreement<ITAG tagnum="81">The State Administration of Import and Export Commodity Inspectionof the People's Republic of China</ITAG>The State Administration of Commodity Inspection (SACI) is the competentauthority in charge of unified supervision and administration of all ofChina's import and export commodity inspections. The CCIB's, attached toSACI, are authorized to conduct the inspection of Chinese ceramicware exporteddirectly or via Hong Kong to the United States. To fulfill its responsibilitiesunder this agreement, the CCIBs' will direct their activities to assuringthat the ceramicware products that are to be offered for export to theUnited States are safe for use in the preparation, serving or storage offood or drink, by inspecting ceramicware products before distribution andby collecting and examining samples to assure compliance with the requirementsidentified in Section VI. CRITERIA FOR CERTIFICATION FOR EXPORT OF CERAMICS.To discharge its responsibilities regarding ceramicware products that areto be offered for export to the United States.1. The CCIBs' are responsible for inspecting and issuing certificates forceramicware exported to the United States under contracts signed by Chinesecorporations. The CCIBs' will have their laboratories examine a representativesample of each category of ceramicware (i.e., Flatware, Small hollowware,and large hollowware) from each production lot of ceramicware to be offeredfor export to the United States. This inspection will be made to determinewhether the ceramicware in each production lot exceeds the action levelsspecified in Section VI. CRITERIA FOR CERTIFICATION FOR EXPORT OF CERAMICS.The laboratories of the CCIB's will assure, by appropriate procedures,that these analyses are completed as described in Section V. ANALYTICALMETHODOLOGY.2. The CCIBs' shall offer for export and shall issue a certificate onlyfor those production lots that meet the criteria set forth in section VI.CRITERIA FOR CERTIFICATION FOR EXPORT OF CERAMICS.3. The CCIBs' shall require that all containers/cartons of delivery lotsof ceramicware exported to the United States under certification be markedwith the production lot number(s).4. The CCIBs' shall include the following information on the certificatefor each production lot of the ceramicware exported to the United States:(a) Production lot identification, including name and address of manufacturer;(b) Test methodology used to determine the levels of leachable lead andcadmium;(c) Analytical results of the tests for lead and cadmium;(d) Number and types of pieces of ceramicware in each production lot;(e) The number and types of the pieces of ceramicware that were tested;(f) Date of the certification; and,(g) Name of the authorizing official and seal of the office. The validatedcertificate(s) will accompany the shipping manifest.5. Shipments exported to the United States via Hong Kong shall be sealedby the CCIBs' in such a way as to prevent opening during transit and theyshall be accompanied by a valid CCIB's certificate.6. The CCIBs' shall affix their certificate(s) to the packing list, suppliedby the manufacturer, for every production lot present in each deliverylot.7. The CCIBs' shall furnish FDA, upon request, with a copy, both in Englishand in Chinese, of their current regulations and of the procedures it usesto assure that each production lot of ceramicware is acceptable.<ITAG tagnum="81">The Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Servicesof the United States of America</ITAG>FDA is charged with the enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug and CosmeticAct and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, certain portions of the PublicHealth Service Act, and other related statutes. FDA directs its activitiestoward the protection of the public health of the United States by assuringthat foods and food-related products are safe and wholesome and are honestlyand informatively labeled. FDA accomplishes this goal firstly through inspectionsof manufacturers and distributors. Second, it collects and analyzes samplesto assure compliance with the statutes it enforces. FDA makes a concertedeffort to ensure that foods and food-related products entering the UnitedStates meet the same standards as domestic products.
