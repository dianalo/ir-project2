A detective is also trying toconfirm whether he used some of his purportedly illegal income to buy a $2million waterfront mansion on a posh island off Bal Harbour, Fla. Peru'sCongress could decide by late July to send the case to criminal court.;    Thestream of revelations has outraged Peruvians who must now not only bearcholera and civil war, but also watch a former icon classed together withinvestment-hungry villains like Saddam Hussein and Imelda Marcos.;    Garciadenies all the charges and brands the probes as products of &quot;terror, plainterror&quot; at the prospect he might run for president in 1995. Indeed, as oftenas people blame Garcia for Peru's current economic crises, they go on topredict his political revival.;    &quot;He could easily (win again),&quot; said a U.S.observer. &quot;He's the single most charismatic man in Peru, with the bestorganized party.&quot;;    Legally prevented from serving a second consecutivepresidential term, Garcia was replaced in office last July by AlbertoFujimori. The new president has quietly re-established U.S. relations thatGarcia soured with anti-imperialist tirades.;    In a long interview, Garciainsisted he has no interest in running again, &quot;now that I know what politicsare.&quot; Yet he added, coyly pointing skyward, that were he to try, he could win&quot;with this one finger.&quot;;    Nonetheless, he'd still have to face some seriousquestions, which are chiefly being asked these days by congressional DeputyFernando Olivera, of the Independent Moralizer Front. Olivera has contractedtwo investigative firms: Kroll Associates in New York, which has tracked thehidden billions of Iraq's Saddam and the Philippines' Marcoses, and LarcInvestigative Services in Miami.;    Kroll's findings, so far, are scanty. AnApril report says &quot;sources we consider to be reliable . . . believe itprobable&quot; Garcia accumulated substantial wealth while in office and kept apersonal account at the ill-famed Bank of Credit and Commerce International,based in Luxembourg.;    The BCCI pleaded guilty last year to money-launderingin federal court in Tampa, Fla., and remains under investigation byprosecutors in New York and Washington.;    The first Larc report is muchtougher. It says Garcia was introduced to BCCI by Panama's Gen. Manuel AntonioNoriega, after which he made several six-figure deposits. The report listsdeposits totaling approximately $50 million between 1986 and 1989, as well assubsequent transfers to European banks, made in names including Maria N.Bodereau, Maria Gabriela Nores and Maria Nores. Garcia says his wife's name isMaria del Pilar Nores, but it has also been reported as Maria Gabriela deNores Bodereau.;    The Larc report, prepared by former U.S. Drug EnforcementAgent Rafael Garcia, also cites rumors that former President Garcia owns ahome in an exclusive island community in Miami, whose residents includeSpanish pop star Julio Iglesias and the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles.Researching one address supplied to him by Olivera, Larc's Garcia found theproperty was owned by a British West Indies firm, which bought it from aPanama-registered corporation in 1987. County records show it has beenassessed at roughly $2 million.;    Alan Garcia denies each accusation. Heacknowledges Peru kept $250 million in assets at BCCI but maintains thedecision to do so was made by the nation's Central Bank, not by him. Heinsists he never kept a personal account at BCCI and calls claims that he didan insult to his intelligence as well as his ethics.;    &quot;Listen, I waspresident at 35,&quot; he says. &quot;Am I such an imbecile? . . . Everyone know's thatif you want a secret account, you make it secret. . . . Hundreds of Peruvianshave these accounts. Am I so stupid to put it in my wife's name? And whathappens if she divorces me?&quot;;    As for the Florida mansion, he says, angrily,&quot;I'm a cultured person. I like Mozart. I like to play piano. Never -- ever --would I go to live in Miami.&quot;;    Garcia says he has nowhere near the fortuneattributed to him, judging his net worth to be no more than $250,000. &quot;I'm amiddle class guy,&quot; he says.;    His presidential salary was only $2,000 amonth, but he says he also earned money as an attorney and by writing books onregional policy.;    Still, despite that lively defense, the scandals havescarred Garcia's image. A recent poll in Lima found 68 percent queriedbelieved he had illegally socked away wealth.;    To be sure, it's ironic thatbanks should be Garcia's bane, since he was theirs for so long. As president,Garcia won international notoriety with his dramatic inaugural announcementthat Peru would limit payments owed to foreign banks to 10 percent of itsexport earnings.;    Yet when Garcia nationalized Peru's banks, halfwaythrough his term, he earned lasting enmity from industrialists.;    &quot;Afterthat, there was a war of publicity against one person: me,&quot; he says.;    To besure, Garcia still has devotees, one of whom is Enrique Zileri, publisher ofthe magazine Caretas. Zileri has defended the ex-president by attacking thoseinvestigating him -- he calls Larc's Garcia &quot;a hood, who will sign anythingfor money&quot; and makes fun of the fact that he works part-time as head ofsecurity for a Miami jai alai stadium.;    The former president, Zileri says,is simply a victim of international envy. &quot;He was too young, too clever andtoo tall. . . . Other world leaders would hug him and find their noses in hisarmpit.&quot;;    Garcia says his foes' intent is to &quot;have me occupied the next twoyears so I can't move politically. But I can wait until time shows I'm right.. . . Later, well, we'll see.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  KATHERINE ELLISON, Mercury News Mexico City Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Lima, Peru  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910610  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,125  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday June 10, 199100162129,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
