Since Sunday, when 157,000 members of the Communication Workers of America went on strike against Bell Atlantic Corp., Pacific Telesis Group and Nynex Corp., there has been little disruption of phone service. Computers continue to hum and lights blink on and off as billions of calls are passed along smoothly to homes and businesses.    &quot;Automation has made it harder for us,&quot; acknowledges Steven Rosenthal, a CWA official in Washington. &quot;There was a time when a strike would have virtually shut down the network.&quot;    Today's telephone networks are operated by sophisticated computer switches and fancy software systems that automatically direct and channel phone calls until they reach the right destination. &quot;The telephone network can do everything by itself,&quot; says Jerry S. Fleischman, a division manager of operations at Bell Communications Research in Livingston, N.J.    &quot;The switches know when you've picked up the telephone,&quot; Mr. Fleischman explains. &quot;They recognize where to send the call. They know routing tables and options. If there's congestion on the network, they know where to re-route a call.&quot;    While the current walkout hasn't interrupted basic telephone service, it is creating some nuisances. Last Sunday, directory assistance in San Francisco was backed up nearly two hours. &quot;My wife and I staged shifts&quot; trying to get through to a directory-assistance operator, says John L. Gonzales, a real estate agent. &quot;We didn't have a phone book, and I was supposed to call my boss at his hotel about dinner arrangements.&quot;    What's more, sure-shot phone calls to the emergency number 911 are sometimes going awry. Requests for new service may not get filled until September, and repairs are being made only in emergency cases. But such problems aren't enough to force management to make quick concessions at the bargaining tables, especially since the telephone companies are saving a bundle. The Bells don't have to pay salaries for striking workers, yet the network continues to function, churning out more revenue.    Joel D. Gross, a vice president at Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., recalls that American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. posted an earnings increase of two cents a share three years ago when workers went on strike. Based on an average union wage of $25,000 a year, the three Bell companies would stand to save about $75.4 million if the strike lasts as long as a week.    In the meantime, about 1,500 managers are performing the essential duties -- such as directory assistance, operator services and emergency repair. But many haven't kept up much with the technology, and they fumble when handling customer calls. Ken Pitt, a Bell Atlantic spokesman, says in any strike there are difficulties getting up to speed. But, he adds, the company already is seeing &quot;proficiency gains.&quot;    Indeed, one manager in Washington who is filling in as a customer service representative has become proficient enough to look up her personal payment files. Sure enough, she says, a customer service worker had dutifully recorded that the manager didn't pay a phone bill one month because her dog had eaten it.    Union leaders are hoping to increase pressure on management by asking consumers to bypass the local telephone company when making toll calls and use their long distance carrier instead. In addition, AFL-CIO leaders urged union members and the public to delay paying their phone bills until the strikes -- over wages and health-care benefits -- are settled.    In the future, new technology will automate the telephone network even more. The Bell companies are starting to build what they call self-healing networks, which ensure uninterrupted service even when a fiber-optic cable is severed or equipment fails.    Some day, voice-recognition technology could make some operator services obsolete. Nynex's New England Telephone, for example, has taught computers to recognize numbers and is using them to reroute phone calls. Instead of a human operator asking callers for the numbers they dialed, computers ask the question. After &quot;listening&quot; to the response, the computer refers the caller to a new number or recorded message. Meanwhile, Northern Telecom Ltd. has developed a voice-recognition technology that automates collect calls and calls that are to be billed to a different phone number. </TEXT></DOC>
