The state grant program providesstates with an opportunity to strengthen and integrate the work of energy,forestry, air quality and other appropriate offices in promoting biomassenergy use. Until recently, most state efforts to promote biomass energyhave been fragmented among a wide range of agencies involved in variousaspects of this energy source. The state grant projects require interagencycooperation and fall into several general categories: industrial conversionassistance; resource availability and use assessments; technical informationdevelopment and dissemination; and conversion of state facilities.</TEXT></DOC>
