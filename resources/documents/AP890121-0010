Nearly 1,000 National Organization for Women demonstrators strewnthrough the inaugural parade crowd of 300,000 wore buttons Fridaythat lighted up to read, ``Keep Abortion Legal.''   ``George Bush can't get to the White House without knowing thereare a lot of us who feel very strongly about our constitutionalrights,'' said NOW President Molly Yard.   In a separate demonstration, four Washington women _ threewearing rubber masks of Ronald and Nancy Reagan and George Bush _marched along the Pennsylvania Avenue sidewalk wearing signsprotesting the extravagance of the inauguration and contrasting itto the nation's need to address problems of the homeless, AIDS andother social issues.   ``This is pretty much like a coronation in a monarchy,'' said AmyBarehr. ``The only difference is George Bush isn't Ronald Reagan'sson.''   As the Bushes moved by in their car, other protesters shook theirfists and jeered, but were virtually drowned out by cheers.   Meanwhile, members of the Counter-Inaugural Coalition for aPeople's Agenda _ a coalition of 80 groups ranging from the GrayPanthers to the Committee in Solidarity with the People of ElSalvador _ distributed thousands of leaflets calling for changes inadministration policies. Their slogan was ``1,000 sparks ofdissent.''   The coalition called for all people to ``have the right toadequate food, housing, clothing and quality health care andeducation.'' In addition, the coalition called for a cleanenvironment, the right to safe, legal abortions, and nodiscrimination against minority groups or AIDS victims.   ``We demand a government responsive to the needs of the peopleand the planet rather than corporate and military interests,'' thegroup said.</TEXT></DOC>
