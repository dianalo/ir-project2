The poll actually shows how a pollster can determine the answer by the way he asks the question -- as the following comparison of the actual Harris Poll and a hypothetical alternative demonstrates.    ---   Preface: As you know, the Senate is holding hearings on whether or not to confirm President Reagan's nomination of Judge Robert Bork to be a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Have you seen or followed any of the hearings on TV or in the newspapers:    1. seen or followed   2. not seen or followed   n. (not sure)   Now let me read you some statements about the Bork nomination. For each tell me if you agree or disagree.    Harris Poll   --President Reagan says that Judge Bork is totally qualified to be on the Supreme Court, then that's enough for me to favor the Senate confirming his nomination.    --Bork has said: &quot;When a state passes a law prohibiting a married couple from using birth control devices in the privacy of their own homes, there is nothing in the Constitution that says the Supreme Court should protect such married people's right to privacy.&quot; *That kind of statement worries me.    --Judge Bork seems to be well informed about the law, and such qualifications are worth more than where he stands on giving minorities equal treatment, protecting the privacy of individuals, or other issues.    --Judge Bork seems to be too much of an extreme conservative, and if confirmed, he would do the country harm by allowing the Supreme Court to turn back the clock on rights for minorities, women, abortion, and other areas of equal justice for all people.    *(In fact, Judge Bork says he never made the statement. In response to a Journal inquiry, a Harris spokesperson on Monday acknowledged, &quot;That was not a verbatim quote. We just used it to facilitate the questioning.&quot; -- Ed.)    Alternative Poll   --If Senator Ted Kennedy says that Judge Bork is totally unqualified to be on the Supreme Court, then that's enough for me to oppose the Senate confirming his nomination.    --Judge Bork has said: &quot; A judge has to make sure that the accused person gets an entirely fair trial. But beyond that, I do not think that the scale should be weighted on the side, unfairly weighted on the side of the criminal.&quot; **That kind of statement pleases me.    --Even the opponents of Judge Bork concede that he is a distinguished legal scholar, well informed about the law, having been a private lawyer, law professor, solicitor general and federal judge. These qualifications are more important than whether I agree with every opinion he has expressed.    --Judge Bork has consistently opposed court decisons that substituted the political opinions of the Supreme Court for the judgment of both Congress and the Constitution. His confirmation would help to restore the kind of government -- of laws, not men -- envisioned by the Founding Fathers.    **(This is a direct quote from Judge Bork's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee. -- Ed.)    All in all, if you had to say, do you think the U.S. Senate should confirm or turn down the nomination of Judge Bork to be on the U.S. Supreme Court?    Results  1. confirm: 29%      1. confirm: ?  2. turn down: 57%    2. turn down: ?  n. not sure: 14%     n. not sure: ?   ---   Mr. Friedman is a senior research fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution.
