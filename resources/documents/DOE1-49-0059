The tank system was excited at the naturalsloshing frequency and the relationship between sloshing magnitude andflow velocity was experimentally investigated for four kinds of flowpatterns. The experiment revealed that the sloshing vibration was almostcompletely suppressed when steady flow in the water surface reached acertain magnitude that reduced the first natural frequency of the sloshingby about 5% to that of still water sloshing. Taking the steady flow inthe water surface into a potential analysis of the sloshing vibration,we obtained the natural frequency as f = (1/2pi]sq root(gk tan h(kh)- (Uk)/sup 2/), k = {pi}/l, l = tank width, which gave a fairly goodexplanation for the sloshing suppression of a flowing liquid system.</TEXT></DOC>
