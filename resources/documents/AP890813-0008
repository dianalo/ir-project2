(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lightning forced the Air Force earlySunday to postpone the launch of a military navigation satellitefor the fourth time in a week.   As rain fell on the launch pad and lightning crackled nearby,the countdown on the Delta rocket continued down to the 4-minutemark and was held there as officials hoped for a break in theweather.   The launch team had only a 21-minute period starting at 2:11a.m. in which to place the Navstar satellite into a desired11,000-mile-high orbit. When the weather did not clear in time, theeffort was called off.   The official reason for the scrub was ``lightning within fivemiles of the launch pad.''   The launch was rescheduled for no earlier than Friday. Officialssaid the long delay is necessary because of other launch activityin the next week.   A schedule conflict with last Tuesday's launch of space shuttleColumbia and thunderstorms resulted in three earlier postponements.   The $65 million Navstar satellite is to join a network ofnavigation spacecraft that can tell U.S. and allied military forceswhere they are anywhere in the world - on land, sea or in the air,and in any weather.   The satellite is the third of 21 improved Navstars that the AirForce plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992. The firsttwo were launched in February and June.</TEXT></DOC>
