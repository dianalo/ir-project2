First, it was confirmedthat a mixed area of non turbulence and turbulent fluidization existed,in which the turbulent fluidization was observed between non turbulent.Then, criteria were established for distinguishing fluidizing areas ofdilute layers containing non turbulent and turbulent fluidization andhigh-velocity fluidization, based on the FFT (fast Fourier transformation)of the static pressure distribution and changes in the pressure in thelayer. A simplified method was proposed to determine these fluidizedareas by measuring pressure changes in the layers only. It was shownthat the critical Rep number between fluidizing layers are fairly wellcorrelated to the function of Ar number under high pressures as wellas normal pressures.
