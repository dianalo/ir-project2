 A Soviet plant will manufacture about10,000 PCs this year, about half of which will be exported to Sweden.andM;DIM YOUR RAYS, PLEASE...Things can get pretty unneighborly and confusing inouter space what with radiation from one rival's satellites interfering withreadings from another rival's satellites.andP;  U.S.andP;  space scientists think it'sa simple enough request to ask Soviet researchers to clean up their nuclearreactors' act: the radiation is promoting cosmic pollution.andM;IT'S ALL IN THE CARDS...Thanks to microchip technology and human ingenuity, apatient's medical history can be recorded on transportable, credit-card sizedplates.andP;  The information can be easily read or retrieved from the cards bymedics using scanners designed for that purpose.andP;  In April, the Newton,Massachusetts, based International Patient Cards Standards Council willsponsor the First World Conference on Patient Cards in Anaheim, California,where medical professionals from around the world will convene to discuss thetechnique and their applications for it.andM;MICRO-ANGELO...Teaching a computer to express its emotions with a paintbrushcan be tricky, but researchers at the University of New Mexico are undauntedand tickled pink(?).andP;  Mechanical engineering professor Mo Shahinpoor and hisstudents have programmed Sean, a robotic arm, to paint what it feels after'listening' to music.andP;  Depending on the mood set by the tone, Seans selects aparticular color of oil paint, applies that to canvas, and in a random,self-directed manner, proceeds to create an emotionally inspired masterpiece.andM;VIRUS BUSTERS...Seems as if everyone is scurrying around trying toexterminate those techie bugs, including the National Institute of Standardsand Industry (NIST) and the U.S.andP;  Pentagon, via its newly formed Computer Emergency Response Team.andP;  NIST's 12-member panel was created from theComputer Security Act of 1987 and will advise NIST on standards andguidelines to battle viruses and prosecute perpetrators.andP;  The Pentagon plansto form a communications center and an emergency team to respond to attackson its systems.andM;STRAP IN YOUR LAPTOP...Along with automobile alarms admonishing you to buckleyour seat belt might come one that reminds you to 'tuck in your laptop, too,'lest it go slam-crashing into the dashboard.andP;  Such was the experience of MarkZirinsky, of Denver-based Zirco, Inc., inspiring him to develop the LaptopCar Seat ($79.95) with medical-furniture, designer Steve Carney.andP;  So ifyou're traveling with small keyboard companions, buckle up: It could save afew chips.andM;U.S.andP;  PLANS TO FIRE SPACE WEAPON...U.S.andP;  officials have decided to testfire aspace weapon based in New Mexico sometime this year, against a backdrop ofcriticism alleging that such an action will escalate the arms race.andP;  Theweapon, Miracl, will hurl laser beams at old satellites in outer space totest its effectiveness.andM;ANCHORS AWEIGH FOR FIBER OPTICS...The installation of the first transoceanicfiber-optic cable was finished last December, linking North America to Europevia a less expensive alternative to satellite communications.andP;  The $361million cost for installing the TAT8 line will be shared by its 30 co-owners,including ATandamp;T, MCI Communications Corp., British Telecommunications PLC,France Telecom, Inc., and Western Union Corp.andP;  TAT8 can  transmit signals at560M bits per second and allow up to 40,000 conversations simultaneously,twice as many permitted by former modes of transmarine communications.andM;UP, UP, AND ALOFT...If 1988 was the year the U.S.andP;  successfully ventured backinto space, then NASA no doubt plans to fortify travel plans in 1989.andP;  Threelaunches are scheduled this year: the Magellan spacecraft in April, theGalileo in October, and the Hubble Space Telescope in December.andP;  In August,the Voyager 2 is scheduled to fly by Neptune for the first-ever close-upviews of that planet and its moon.andM;JAPAN: WHO, US?...That never-ending battle between the United States andJapan over the semiconductor chip agreement or disagreement is heating upagain.andP;  The U.S.andP;  has been accused of wrongfully crying wolf--charging Japanwith violating its agreement to reduce chip manufacturing, thus allowing theU.S.andP;  an equal chance to compete.andM;CALLING ALL U.S.andP;  STUDENTS...What originally began as an attempt to recruitmore racial minorities into graduate and science programs has become aredirected effort to recruit all American students into the fields.andP;  The U.S.andO;Department of Education reports that foreign-born students now constitute themajority of the enrollees in graduate science programs.andP;  To give indigentAmericans a leg up, the agency has instituted the Graduate  Assistance inAreas of National Need program, which allocated $7.7 million in grants itsfirst year.andM;CRAY KNOWS BEST...Man's knowledge surely supercedes him when he invents aninstrument that computes answers for which humans cannot vouch.andP;  A team ofU.S.andP;  and Canadian mathematicians recently submitted a proof problem--Could afinite projective plane of Order 10 exist?--to a Cray supercomputer.andO;Trillions of computations later, it spit out an answer: No.andP;  The one problem,however, is that only the Cray can verify the answer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
