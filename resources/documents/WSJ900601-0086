Talk now is turning to action.</LP><TEXT>   In recent weeks, nearly a dozen American corporations haveannounced multimillion-dollar investment programs in the Eastbloc. Some of America's biggest companies are involved,including General Motors Corp., Dow Chemical Co., EastmanKodak Co., S.C. Johnson andamp; Son Inc. and Xerox Corp.   The projects chiefly are of two types: marketing ventures-- with or without local partners -- to establish domesticsales organizations, or more-ambitious joint ventures forlocal manufacturing.   The opening of Eastern Europe &quot;is a major, significantmove,&quot; says Edwin Buehlmann, American Express Co.'s seniorvice president, Eastern Europe. The financial-servicescompany already markets dollar-denominated charge cards inseveral East bloc countries and plans to spend $2 millionmore this year to open travel centers in Budapest, Prague,Warsaw and East Berlin. General Motors is investing more than$150 million in the region and last Friday announced an EastGerman car-making venture and its second Hungarian productioninvestment. GM's strategy is to gain &quot;a foothold in themarket,&quot; says spokesman Ron Theis.   The best barometer of U.S. investment objectives is theWashington-based Overseas Private Investment Corp., a U.S.agency that provides political-risk insurance to U.S.companies abroad. James Hall, a spokesman, says there hasbeen &quot;an explosion&quot; in new registrations for East blocinvestments, primarily in Hungary and Poland. OPIC is nowprocessing insurance requests for 100 investment projectsvalued at a total of $1.5 billion, up from 45 projects valuedat $500 million at the end of 1989, Mr. Hall says. OPIC alsohas received feelers for an additional $500 million ininvestments, he says.   Of course, pitfalls abound. Enthusiasm about inexpensiveEast bloc labor is tempered by problems of supply, qualityand currency convertibility. Instability in such areas asRomania and the Soviet republics places a big question markover the safety of investments. Some executives, mindful ofprevious disappointments in China, believe it may be yearsbefore Eastern Europe becomes a lucrative market.   Nevertheless, many companies are investing now in ordernot to miss an opening. &quot;The initial, few large deals wereopportunistic. Now, you are seeing the results of peoplehaving done some market research, and acting to fulfill astrategic plan,&quot; says Colin Berry, a London-based director atinvestment bankers Morgan Grenfell Group PLC. He has seenparticular East bloc interest among telecommunicationscompanies and such hotel chains as Marriott, Hyatt andIntercontinental.   Three sorts of U.S. investors dominate East Europeanactivity. The first is the U.S. multinational, more than 40of which joined an OPIC investment mission to Hungary andPoland last month, including Olin Corp., Marathon Oil Co.,Warnaco and TRW Inc. The second category is ethnic, companiesled by people who have East European family ties. The thirdcategory is small or medium-sized businesses that findspecial expertise, as well as cost advantages, in EastEurope.   An example of the latter category is Erie Scientific Co.,a Portsmouth, N.H., maker of laboratory glass that opened amicroscope-slide venture in Budapest in March. FrankJellinek, president, says Erie cut its average wage costs 90%from a comparable unit it operates in West Germany, with noloss in quality because of the skills of Erie's Hungarianglassmaking joint-venture partner. The venture took less thansix months to organize and was profitable in its firstquarter; Erie plans to double the size of the $1 millioninvestment.   Major recent U.S. investments include:   -- General Motors is investing more than $150 million intwo Hungarian ventures to make engines, wiring assemblies andvehicles. The auto maker also said last Friday it plans tostart building Opel models in East Germany this year. TheEast German operation, a joint venture with AutomobilwerkeEisenach, is the first step in GM's plan to increase Europeancapacity by 25% by the mid-1990s.   -- S.C. Johnson, the Racine, Wis., consumer-productscompany, is spending &quot;tens of millions&quot; of dollars onexpanding its East bloc sales and manufacturing efforts, saysGianni Montezemolo, vice president for new markets. Johnson'sbiggest project is a planned manufacturing joint venture inthe Ukraine, with about 500 employees, to supply the Sovietand East European markets with such brand-name products asPledge and Raid.   Johnson has several East bloc sales offices and has beenimporting its products from factories in Holland for 20years. But the company concluded that Eastern Europe &quot;is abig market. You need to manufacture locally,&quot; says Mr.Montezemolo.   The company, along with other East bloc manufacturers,faces tough problems including quality control, absenteeismand differing working practices. At Johnson, plans call foradditional training for new workers. The company is alreadyworking to instill Western working practices. For example,after months of grappling with inefficient responses to phonecalls or telexes by Soviet staff, Johnson &quot;made a rule thatwhenever we send a communication, they have to acknowledgeit, even if is to say that nothing has happened,&quot; says Mr.Montezemolo.   -- Dow Chemical, Midland, Mich., is spending $16 millionto build a plastic-foam insulation plant adjacent to anexisting chemical plant on Hungary's Lake Balaton, about 60miles outside Budapest. The plant, a joint venture withHungary's state chemical company Nitrokemia and Chemolimpex,the state chemical-marketing organization, is scheduled tocome on stream in the first or second quarter next year, saysWilliam E. Cornelius, Dow's director of trade policy.   Dow's plans for a $1 billion Soviet plastics plant havebeen stalled by recent political uncertainty in the SovietUnion. Some Western experts say Moscow increasingly wants bigprojects to be based in the Russian republic, rather than inindependence-seeking outlying republics. In the meantime, Dowis content to focus on beefing up local staff in its Eastbloc sales and marketing arms. Its East European salescurrently total $300 million annually.   -- Among other companies, Xerox's U.K.-based Rank Xeroxoffice-equipment affiliate expects to spend about #11 million($18.7 million) over the next 18 months boosting sales andservice operations in Eastern Europe. The company sees salesgrowing to #200 million annually in five years from #50million, a growth rate that won't be seen &quot;anywhere else inthe world,&quot; says David Thompson, Rank Xerox's executivedirector.   Eastman Kodak has set up Hungarian and Polishfilm-processing works and is expanding such operations in theSoviet Union. And consumer-products maker Procter andamp; GambleCo. is trying to set up local marketing operations.   ---                   Here Come the Americans                                                                                                               U.S. Investment in Eastern Europe measured by         Registrations for OPIC investment insurance                                                                                                          1988                             $0                                                                                                          1989                             $500 million                                                                                                          1990*                            $1.5 billion                                                                                                          *To date                                                                                                          Source: Overseas Private Investment Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
