A report from the General Accounting Office said the decisionsof Frank Sato to end audits or not issue reports in nine instances,and his conclusions in those cases, were exercises of professionaljudgment and results of a policy ``not to issue reports that, inhis judgment, would not accomplish a useful purpose.''   Anonymous complaints from people in Sato's office to Congresssaid Sato, inspector general from 1981 to 1988, had not issuedreports or else had changed conclusions in eight cases underpressure from the agency's administrators, Harry Walters before1986 or Tom Turnage in 1986-1988.   The staff of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee asked theGeneral Accounting Office to examine those eight cases plus onemore it was concerned about.   ``While not taking a position as to whether the former IGreached the right decision in each case, we recognize that whendealing with sensitive, controversial issues, reasonable peoplecan, and often do, arrive at different conclusions. ... We believethis is the central issue here,'' said the GAO report dated March17 and received Tuesday.   In four cases, Sato wrote a memo to or briefed theadministrator, either Walters or Turnage, or wrote to programofficials about his findings. In five cases the report or otherdocument was listed as available to the public.   According to the GAO report, Sato ``said that in sensitivesubject areas, he did not want to create controversy unless itwould lead to improvements'' and expressed frustration about``recommending that a VA facility not be built, when it was alreadydetermined by the agency and the Congress that the facility wasneeded and would be built to help meet the agency's mission,despite any IG recommendation to the contrary.''   Sato, now retired, said ``he was never asked or directed byanyone else, including the VA administrator, to cancel or not issuean audit report, or to water down a report,'' and all decisionswere his own, the report said.   Only two of 50 people interviewed in the inspector general'soffice believed there was ``an independence problem,'' and thosetwo did not provide ``evidence to show the former IG was impairedin his reporting decisions,'' GAO said.   The GAO report by Jeffrey C. Steinhoff, director of financialmanagement system issues, said ``in the future, reasons for notissuing reports should be documented and placed in the (office)files.''   New audit standards issued last year require such a memo, andthe acting VA inspector general, Renald Morani, has agreed tofollow such a policy, GAO said.</TEXT></DOC>
