<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-72-0508 </DOCNO><TEXT>The results of a survey of Westinghouse plants to determine if high cobaltparts are always used in the charging flow control valve located downstreamof the charging pump in the Chemical and Volume Control System (CVCS)and a revised cobalt input estimate from all valves in the CVCS systemare described in this report. In addition, information gained from retrievalof wear data from the Nuclear Plant Reliability Data System is summarized.It was found that the cobalt input from CVCS system valves could rangefrom 4 to 7 percent of the total annual plant cobalt input dependingupon the type of charging flow control valve used.</TEXT></DOC>
