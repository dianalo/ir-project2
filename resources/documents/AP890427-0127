Herb Kelly says he has a kidney infection and lung cancer heblames on exposure to radiation during his 27 years working at theDepartment of Energy's Fernald nuclear facility in Ohio.   Mrs. Oldham and Kelly are among thousands due to participateFriday in ``Workers Memorial Day,'' when labor unions plan morethan 100 events in 37 states and the District of Columbia tohighlight safety issues in a month of anniversaries of milestonesand tragedies in job safety.   ``I think it's important to remember the workers who have beenhurt and killed in the line of duty,'' Kelly said in a telephoneinterview. ``Maybe this type of thing can stop it before it getsworse.''   One of the events will be in Honolulu, marking the firstanniversary of the death of flight attendant C.B. Lansing, whovanished 24,000 feet above the Pacific on April 28, 1988, when theroof of Aloha Air Flight 243 ripped open.   In Bridgeport, Conn., a ceremony will honor the 28 constructionworkers killed two years ago this month in a building collapse.   Friday was chosen because it is the 19th anniversary of thefounding of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.   The events, organizers say, will highlight what they see as theshortcomings of OSHA and its accomplishments and serve as areminder that an estimated 10,000 people a year are killed on thejob. That estimate does not include those who die of job-relateddiseases or suffer non-fatal injuries at work.   According to government figures, jobs in mining, transportation,construction and agriculture carry the highest risk of fatalinjury, with unguarded machinery, trench cave-ins, electrocutionand motor vehicle accidents responsible for the largest number ofdeaths.   ``If we are to do honor to the thousands of working men andwomen who have sacrificed life and limb on the job, then we mustredouble our efforts to enact stronger and more effective laws,''said AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, who will attend the memorialservice for the Kansas City firefighters Friday. ``We will fightuntil the day when the spilling of workers' blood at the job siteis nothing more than a memory.''   A study released Thursday by a private Washington research groupsupports some of labor's criticisms of OSHA.   The agency, considered by labor leaders to be short-staffed,lost one-third of its inspectors to Reagan administration budgetcuts, fails to coordinate criminal investigations with the JusticeDepartment, levies fines so small they serve as no deterrent toworker-safety abuses and lacks the necessary police authority tohalt unsafe practices, the Bureau of National Affairs said. It saidit interviewed more than 125 prosecutors, private attorneys, labor,industry officials and government officials and others.   The 1.2 million-member American Federation of State, County andMunicipal Employees has rallies planned in 30 cities to point outwhat it considers another flaw of OSHA: it does not coverpublic-sector employees.   Some of the tragedies being remembered were highly publicized.Others received little attention.   In Bloomington, Ill., demonstrators will read a roll of formerworkers at an asbestos plant whose deaths allegedly were linked toexposure to the product; in Omaha, Neb., three U.S. senators willjoin workers to discuss hazards in the meatpacking industry.   The AFL-CIO is organizing about a dozen of the events; itsmember unions dozens more, from northern Maine to southernCalifornia to the memorial service for Lansing in Honolulu.   In New York, bus drivers will pull into the nearest stop tohonor a one-minute moment of silence and Roman Catholic CardinalJohn O'Connor will lead a special labor Mass honoring workerskilled on the job, including two track workers struck by a trainMarch 30. Bells will toll across the state at 12:15 p.m. EDT.   In Cincinnati, Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, Sen. HowardMetzenbaum, D-Ohio, and others are to discuss contamination atFernald.   Kelly said he'll be on hand. He has not worked since 1984because of his illnesses; the government is fighting his workers'compensation claim on grounds there is no evidence his healthproblems are linked to his former job.</TEXT></DOC>
