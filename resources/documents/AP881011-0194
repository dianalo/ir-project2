The diplomats reported rocket attacks on several provincialcapitals and airports, and said the rebels closed a strategic road,reducing the supply of food to Kabul, the capital.   The rebel spokesman, Asim Nasser-Zia of the National IslamicFront of Afghanistan, said Asadabad, capital of northeastern Kunarprovince, fell to guerrillas Monday after a month-long campaign. Hesaid the victory gave insurgents control of the entire province,which borders Pakistan.   The reported victory also opens a northern route to Kabul andgives guerrillas access to Jalalabad. Asadabad is about 12 milesfrom Pakistan, where border towns and refugee camps serve asguerrilla bases, and 100 miles northeast of Kabul.   Moslem insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in April1978 and the Soviet Union sent military forces to Afghanistan inDecember 1979. Under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed last April,the Soviets have been withdrawing their estimated 115,000 soldiers.   The guerrillas were not a party to the agreement betweenPakistan and Afghanistan, which the Soviet Union and United Statessigned as guarantors, and vowed to conmtinue fighting.   They claim to have overrun several Afghan army garrisons and twoprovincial capitals in two weeks, bringing the number of capitalsin their hands to four.   Sharan, capital of Paktika province in the east, was reportedcaptured early last week, and diplomats confirmed it.   Guerrillas also claim to control the capitals of Takhar provincein northern Afghanistan and Bamyan in the center of the mountainousnation.   Mohammad Ishaq, spokesman for the Khalis faction of theHezb-E-Islami guerrilla group, said several strategic garrisons inKunar province were captured along with Asadabad.   Diplomats said 20-25 rockets are fired every day at the airportin Kandahar, a southern city. They said the airport in Lashkargah,capital of western Helmand province, has been closed to civiliantrafic. Airports are regular guerrilla targets.   Busloads of wounded arrived in Kabul after the bombing ofvillages near Maidan Shahr, capital of central Wardak province,diplomats reported. Guerrillas captured Maidan Shahr earlier butwere pushed out by heavy bombing, rebels and diplomats reported.   Guerrillas said they had closed the Kabul-Jalalabad highway anddiplomats said no traffic moved east from the capital between Oct.2-6.
