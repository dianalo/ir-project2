The pollutant in question, oxides of nitrogen, accounts forabout one-third of the acidity in rainfall in the eastern UnitedStates and Canada.   The Cabinet's Domestic Policy Council, with Reagan presiding,was briefed on a proposal coming from a United Nations-sponsorednegotiation that would freeze emissions until 1996, pending furtherresearch on the effects of nitrogen oxides and how to reduce them.   Reagan made no decision, but participants expect one soon.   Oxides of nitrogen are formed in the combustion of fossil fuelsin industry, utilities and motor vehicles. In the air they may betransformed into nitric acid. In urban areas they are an essentialraw material for making smog.   U.S. emissions have been roughly steady since 1980 and accordingto EPA projections should remain that way until about 1995, whenslow increases should start. The 21.3 million tons emitted in 1986,the most recent year available, were 8.5 percent below the peakyear of 1978.   According to two participants in discussions over the issue,both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, the EnvironmentalProtection Agency supports joining the treaty while the EnergyDepartment, supported by the Interior and Commerce departments andthe Office of Management and Budget, opposes it.   EPA spokesmen declined to discuss their agency's participationin the meeting. The telephone of an Energy Department official towhom questions were referred did not answer.   The United States in 1985 declined to join a similarinternational agreement calling for a 30 percent reduction inemissions of the other major precursor of acid rain, sulfur dioxide.</TEXT></DOC>
