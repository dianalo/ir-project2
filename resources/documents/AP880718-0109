With the Massachusetts governor and his only challenger inaccord, their lieutenants were expected to reach compromises onmany of the Jackson campaign's 13 minority positions.   But Jackson appeared ready to fight on the convention floorTuesday night for his cornerstone issues: an endorsement of highertaxes on the wealthy and corporations, a five-year Pentagon freezeand full-funding of Head Start, pre-natal and nutrition programsfor mothers and infants.   Dukakis said before the meeting that he was confident theDemocrats would produce ``a good, solid platform'' despitecontinued disagreement between his forces and the Jackson campaignon certain planks.   Jackson made a similar point in their joint appearance aftertheir private talks.   ``The platform negotiations will resume today. No doubt therewill be debate and deliberation on tomorrow night, but debate anddeliberation stirs the soul of our democracy,'' Jackson said.``Through debate over the soul of our party, we debate policy andpriorities and direction.''   ``There will be some reasonable disagreement I suspect oncertain platform planks, but the platform process itself has beenremarkably peaceful and harmonious,'' Dukakis said on ABC-TV's``Good Morning America.''   He predicted that the Democrats will come ``out of thisconvention in very strong shape,'' with ``a good, solid platform.''   On the eve of the convention, Jackson said Sunday that it is upto the delegates to decide whether his minority positions on taxesand defense are actually majority positions.   The Democratic Party faced the possibility of a lengthy debateTuesday on some of the 13 minority reports filed by the Jacksoncampaign. However, most were expected to be dropped if Jackson andDukakis settle their larger differences.   Until then, party spokesman Mike McCurry said, the platform ``isin the twilight zone.''   Party Chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr. told reporters today that helikes the streamlined platform as presently written. It's ``a goodstrong platform that could help the Democrats win,'' Kirk said.   The majority report is under 4,500 words, and even with all ofJackson's amendments it would still be the party's shortestplatform in five decades.   The Platform Committee chairman, Michigan Gov. James J.Blanchard, was hosting a luncheon today for the 186-member panel tocelebrate its compliance with Kirk's instructions to produce ashort document.   Rosemary Freeman, executive director of the Platform Committee,said it would take at least 30 minutes to debate and conduct a rollcall on each disputed minority plank. Party rules allow 10 minutesfor each side to speak before the roll is called.   The Dukakis campaign has said repeatedly it will not acceptJackson's call for higher taxes, a Pentagon freeze, a policy ofno-first-use of nuclear weapons, and support of self-determinationfor the Palestinians.   Some Jackson minority planks cover less thorny domestic issuesthat lend themselves more readily to compromise. These includedJackson's call for full funding of Head Start, pre-natal care andthe Women, Infants and Children program, doubling the educationbudget, and creation of a national health program.   Delegates from the National Education Association, which boastsone of the largest labor contingents at the convention, voted at acaucus Sunday to support the Jackson education plank. More thanhalf the 291 teacher delegates are Dukakis supporters.</TEXT></DOC>
