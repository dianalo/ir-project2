(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New Jersey must bow to the laws of love, afederal judge ruled Friday in striking down a state rule forbiddingmarriage between police officers and municipal court clerks workingin the same town.   In sweeping language, U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politangave his blessing to the union of Joseph and Marie Hughes of NorthArlington. Hughes, a detective, is an 18-year veteran of the townpolice force; he met Mrs. Hughes, a municipal court clerk since1981, in the court's hallways.   They married in July 1988 and informed state courtadministrators, who told them one would have to resign. The couplesued and were allowed to remain in their jobs pending a courtdecision.   The rule was designed to prevent a conflict of interest, butPolitan rejected that justification.   ``No law, regardless of intent, should have a `chilling effect'upon marriage,'' the judge wrote in his opinion. ``The Court shouldencourage legitimate marriage, not discourage it.''   Such ``broad brush regulations ... suggest mechanical,computer-like answers to human problems of constitutionaldimensions.''   Mrs. Hughes said more than 10 couples with similar problemsacross New Jersey had contacted her about the case.   ``It's going to make a lot of people out there happy,'' she saidat the courthouse after picking up the opinion with her lawyers. Shesaid she knew of clerks who had resigned or taken demotions over thelaw.   Dorothy Crissey, president of the state Municipal Court Clerk'sAssociation, said the group supported the couple's fight. New Jerseyhas about 1,000 municipal clerks and deputy clerks.   ``You have an awful lot of people who have met and fallen in loveand have not been able to a lead a normal life,'' she said.   Michael L. Diller, the deputy attorney general who handled thecase for the state, did not immediately return a telephone message.   The rule, set by the Administrative Office of the Courts, says nospouse, parent or child of a police officer can be a municipal clerkor deputy clerk, with exceptions for officer-clerk relationshipsthat began before the rule took effect in 1977.   Politan said the rule violated the Hughes' constitutional rightsto due process and equal protection. He recognized the state'sinterest in preserving conflict-free appearances, but said the rightto marriage outweighs the rule. He also noted that a court clerkcould easily step aside from a case involving a spouse.   James Katz, lawyer for Millville's court clerk and a city officerwho live together awaiting another federal judge's ruling on theirchallenge of a related rule preventing cohabitation, said Politan'sopinion would help their case.   ``More importantly, it's sending a message that the (courtadministrative office) should keep its eyes and hands out of thebedrooom,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
