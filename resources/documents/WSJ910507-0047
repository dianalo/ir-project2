Multi-Local, which hopes to sell half its stock to thepublic, is a high-growth, cash-flow-rich media company with aseductive story that sets it apart from the crowd. Itsmanagement, led by Chief Executive Officer James Dunning, ishighly regarded. And its owners -- Acadia Partners; Mr.Dunning and other officers; and the insurer Cigna -- aren'tselling any stock in the company, which publishes yellow-pagedirectories.</LP><TEXT>   There is, however, one potential problem: the price.   &quot;This is riskier than putting money into Ann Taylor orCaldor,&quot; says Robert Natale, a new-issues analyst forStandard andamp; Poor's. &quot;Given the debt restrictions that couldlimit growth, and the risks involved, investors should be cuta better break. The valuation seems rather high.&quot;   Multi-Local plans to sell 6.3 million new shares at about$12 apiece -- nearly three times what current owners paid.That would put an implicit value on all of its stock of about$152 million. Neither Multi-Local nor its owners, nor FirstBoston, the lead underwriter, would comment, but the pitch toinvestors is expected to focus on the company's distinctivebusiness niche.   Multi-Local publishes yellow-page directories in 119communities in Long Island, Brooklyn and Queens, N.Y., and inSouth Florida. Those who came of age before the Bell System'sbreakup might think the industry prosaic. But on Wall Street,yellow pages are regarded as the hottest thing in publishingthis side of Kitty Kelley.   Although the Baby Bell companies dominate yellow-pagepublishing on a county level, small businesses often want toadvertise to distinct, more-local audiences. As noted byPaineWebber in a report dated April 10: &quot;Why, say, would asouth-side-of-town pizza place want to pay for an ad to beseen also on the north side, 15 miles distant, unless a lotof northsiders relished cold pizza?&quot;   PaineWebber, which happens to be one of Multi-Local'sunderwriters, added: &quot;Investment opportunities may wellarise. Check back from time to time; look under the heading`exciting.'&quot;   In the past three years, Multi-Local's cash flow hasjumped roughly 20% annually to $20 million (before interestpayments) in the fiscal year ended last October. Andaccording to the confident story line sounded inMulti-Local's prospectus, the business is immune to flood,famine and recession, or nearly so. The offering documentsays Multi-Local &quot;believes that yellow pages advertisingprovides a more stable source of revenue than many forms ofadvertising even in unfavorable economic conditions.&quot;   However, the prospectus also notes that in the firstquarter of its current fiscal year, same-book ad revenue rosea scant 3.8% from a year earlier. Sales, Multi-Local notes,&quot;were adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditionsin the company's markets, and by the war in the PersianGulf.&quot; Apparently, the fortunes of Long Island pizzeriasdepend on the maintenance of calm in the Middle East.Multi-Local's first-quarter cash flow fell sharply, but thatdrop appears to reflect a switch in publishing schedules.   After its offering, Multi-Local would have $124 million inlong-term debt. Thus, its stock and debt would equal 14 timescash flow in the most recent year. &quot;In the private market,it's worth eight or nine times cash flow,&quot; according to anindustry analyst.   Interest payments this year would be $19 million. That,combined with capital spending of as much as $1.5 million,would equal Multi-Local's prior-year cash flow. What's more,Multi-Local has hefty debt repayments beginning in 1992 andan increasing thirst for working capital that rises withsales. &quot;Future debt repayments may require funds in excess of. . . cash flow,&quot; the prospectus says.   Like other new stocks, Multi-Local is actually an oldface, having gone public just before the crash in 1987. In1988, Acadia took it private -- at a profit to the public --in a leveraged buy-out. Acadia, which is controlled byAmerican Express, Equitable Life Assurance Society and aRobert Bass-led group, soon after tried to sell Multi-Localto a private buyer, but couldn't get its price. Then in 1990,Multi-Local went into default on bank loans. Acadiarefinanced the loans and brought the company out of default.Now, the IPO would reduce Acadia's total $92 million exposureto the company by repaying $62.6 million of Multi-Local'sdebt held by Acadia.   Fans of Multi-Local say that, despite its first-quarterreturns, the company will continue to post hefty double-digitgains in cash flow-even in this recession year. The companyhas a solid franchise in Long Island, where it has operatedfor decades, as well as in Brooklyn and Queens, newerterritory. Multi-Local hopes to break into New Jersey, butthat market has already been tapped by Gannett, which boughta large New Jersey yellow-page chain last month.   Multi-Local is said to be doing well with one newerproduct: business-to-business directories in New York. And ithas started heady new ventures such as selling ads inrecorded telephone announcements. Thus, the question isn'twhether Multi-Local will grow, but how fast.   &quot;They're taking advantage of the reverse LBO craze,&quot; Sandamp;P'sMr. Natale says. &quot;It would seem to me there are betteropportunities.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
