(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A lone kayaker and other anti-nuclearactivists confronted a barge carrying the containment vessel fromone of the nation's oldest commercial nuclear reactors as it movedup the Columbia River on Monday.   The kayaker, Stan Overbay, paddled out to the barge and placedhimself in front of the lead tugboat, but a Coast Guard vesseljockeyed him out of the way and the barge continued withoutstopping.   The concrete- and steel-encased reactor vessel fromShippingport, Pa., is on the last leg of an 8,000-mile voyage toburial at the Hanford, Wash., nuclear reservation. The U.S.Department of Energy said radioactive fuel has been removed fromthe shell and it poses no threat to public health.   The barge passed into the Colombia River near Astoria Mondaymorning and was expected to complete the 100-mile journey toPortland after dark, said Lt. Commander David Gault of the CoastGuard.   Near Astoria, the tug that brought the barge from Pennsylvaniathrough the Panama Canal turned back and was replaced by a tugowned by Knappton Shipping Co. of Astoria, Gault said.   About 20 people staged a protest at an Astoria pier as the bargepassed by, and demonstrations also were planned at Portland andHood River, about 65 miles up river from Portland.   A person standing six feet from the 1,000-ton container vesselwould receive no more radiation than they would from the sun overthe same period, according to the Department of Energy.   ``If it really is so safe, why does it need Coast Guard cuttersguarding it and why wouldn't they say when it's coming?'' saidJoanne Oleksiak of the Northwest Radiation Alert Network   She said Northwest residents don't want the Columbia, whichforms the border between Washington and Oregon, used as athoroughfare for nuclear waste.   ``It's not the kind of thing people want passing by their picnicor their houseboat,'' she said.   The Coast Guard has established a safety zone 400 yards ahead,200 yards behind and 100 years to either side of the barge, andviolators face criminal and civil penalities, said Coast GuardPetty Officer Bret Koontz in Seattle.   Gault said there have been several shipments up the Columbia inwhich safety zones were established.   ``This is nothing new for us,'' he said. ``The only differencethis time is there's been more publicity.''</TEXT></DOC>
