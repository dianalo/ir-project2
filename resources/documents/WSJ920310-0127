He allegedly used that information to make about$68,000 for Bear Stearns by conducting trades on behalf ofhis former employer, a unit of Bear Stearns Cos., in itsarbitrage account. He also passed the information on to EbenSmith, a broker at Smith Barney, Harris, Upham andamp; Co., whofaces related civil and criminal insider trading lawsuits.   Later that year, the SEC suit said, Mr. Baity receivedinside information from the same unidentified person aboutChemical Bank's acquisition of Texas Commerce Bancshares. Hepassed the information on to Mr. Smith, who used it to make aprofit of $33,000 for himself and $33,000 for customers, theSEC suit alleges.   In neither case is it alleged that Mr. Baity personallyprofited from the trading of insider information.Nonetheless, Mr. Baity agreed to pay $210,000, representingthe total profits and interest earned by others, includingBear Stearns. He'll also pay civil penalties of about$154,000. Federal prosecutors said that they'll allow Mr.Baity to reduce his total payment by about $70,000 because ofcurrent financial difficulties.   Andrew Citron, an attorney for Mr. Baity, said his clientsettled rather than face the expense of a trial.
