Lt. Gen. Charles W. Brown, head of the Defense SecurityAssistance Agency, said weapons furnished without charge would be``excess defense articles.'' He told the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee that they would be given to military forces in LatinAmerica and the Caribbean.   He said the administration is asking $21 million for the purposein the year that begins Oct. 1, beyond the present spending level.   ``The biggest increase in this group is for Colombia, where theactivities of drug barons and insurgent groups, sometimes workingtogether, threaten the very survival of the legal system anddemocratic government,'' he said.   He added that the next largest increase would go to Peru becauseit is in a similar situation, and there would also be increases forBolivia and the eastern Caribbean. Drug traffickers often useCaribbean islands as relay points for drugs from South America.   His prepared testimony did not mention Mexico, another majorsource of narcotics. Nor did it list the arms to be given under thenew program.   The ``intention would be to make equipment available at thelow-tech end of the spectrum, (that is) basic military equipmentsuitable for use in low-intensity conflict against drugtraffickers,'' he said.   Brown said that U.S. efforts at cooperation had been mostly withlocal police, with occasional use of U.S. military transport.   ``We believe that local military forces are ready to and musttake a larger role in these efforts,'' he added.   ``They are the only forces large enough to do it; they have theinfrastructure; they can act as a disciplined and trained force,and it is far better that they take this role rather than U.S.combat forces.''   At home the Pentagon has resisted any move to have its forcestake part in drug arrests or investigations, though it cooperatesin the battle against narcotics by lending its equipment to lawenforcement agencies.   Brown said that in Latin America, the armed forces need U.S.money for equipment, training and support if they are to do moreagainst drugs.   ``This is not to say that the military can supplant the localpolice forces, but they have a role to play,'' he added.   He noted that the Colombian and Peruvian forces are alsofighting insurgents who have roots and objectives independent ofdrug dealers, though he said there are tactical alliances betweenthem.</TEXT></DOC>
