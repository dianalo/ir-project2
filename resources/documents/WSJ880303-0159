The government figures referred to in the article were nothing more than annual proven reserves (i.e., the discovered and producible oil at a given moment), and these data are provided as a public service. Whoever chose to take out the advertisement -- not the government source of the information -- offered the prediction of an end {to America's oil and gas reserves} being in sight.    Informed observers would agree with Mr. Hite that such a prediction is naive, because new oil from additional discoveries is added every year. I would go on to say, however, that the prediction is so naive and, in this case, so self-serving as to be not credible, and most certainly not worthy of 12 years of careful monitoring.    But did we -- and do we -- have a petroleum resource problem, and did the government do anything to save us, as Mr. Hite asks? The answer is yes on both counts. As to the former, we import some 40% of our needs from sources that can only become more narrow in the future. This constitutes a serious problem. As to the latter, in the 1970s the government took over the necessary function of reporting reserves when the privately organized American Petroleum Institute and the American Gas Association declined to continue providing this information.    The government also began to report systematically on the potential for undiscovered resources. These estimates, in combination with existing reserves and production rates, permit one to at least consider future domestic supply possibilities. Never mind those very early assessments by the Interior Department. Yes, they turned out to be wrong, but they were issued by honorable people before anybody even understood the origin of petroleum or could measure the basins in which it occurred.    Times have changed; not such that omniscience prevails, but certainly the data base for assessment is far stronger, and a continuing rationale remains for honorable people, be they of government or otherwise, to estimate the probable amounts of both discovered and undiscovered resources. And it is not just the amount of oil that is required. Where is it geographically, and how much is recoverable how fast?    Some of those unconventional resources, referred to by Mr. Hite, can only be produced slowly, and simply are not suited to the gluttonous consumption of energy users, no matter the resource's extraordinary dimensions in the ground. Further, they will cost some increment more, and many potential users will no longer be able to afford their position at the demand trough. In effect, they will perceive that we have run out of oil.    In the 1970s, the government alerted and prepared the nation for energy-supply problems by mandating petroleum-conservation measures. These are still a good idea because petroleum is in static to ever-shorter domestic supply, and money to buy oil from overseas is overwhelmingly the major element in the trade deficit. Mr. Hite's recollection that &quot;government just continued in the general chaotic state&quot; seems to me to be selective and to slight the democratic process that attempts to honor the pluralism in our society.
