Macleod </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   It isn't easy being a world-class athlete and a high school student. &quot;It can be rough. Sometimes you just want to kick back and have a Coca-Cola,&quot; says 18-year-old Ben Maruquin of Ventura, Calif., who juggles tests and term papers with a grueling travel schedule that's taken him to six countries in as many months.    His 16-year-old teammate Laurent &quot;Lorenzo&quot; De Janvry, of Berkeley, admits to another, more basic problem: &quot;People come up to you and ask what's in your bag. They think it's a lacrosse stick or golf club. When you show them your hockey stick you get comments like 'Do you wear a skirt?'&quot;    Ben, Lorenzo and the other 14 boys on the U.S. junior field hockey team are used to such occasional indignities in a country where &quot;hockey&quot; means ice hockey and &quot;field hockey&quot; conjures up images of kilted girls with ponytails racing around prep-school fields. Don't let that fool you: Top-level hockey as played by both sexes nowadays is an aggressive game similar to soccer, featuring bullet-like short passes and shots on goal, though deliberate contact still isn't allowed.    Only about 3,000 American males play hockey, mostly in California and along the Northeast corridor from Washington to southern Connecticut. But if these boys are a rarity in the U.S., they have plenty of stick-wielding brethren abroad. Hockey is played by men in 83 countries and is the national sport of India and Pakistan. Most surprisingly, it ranks among the top three male team sports in the world, in number of participants, along with soccer and basketball.    Officials of the Field Hockey Association of America, the governing body of men's hockey here, think it's time to put hockey sticks in a lot more American boys' lockers -- and U.S. teams atop the international rankings.    &quot;We're like soccer was 20 years ago,&quot; says Manzar Iqbal, a 29-year-old Manhattanite who captained the 1984 U.S. Olympic men's team. &quot;We need exposure. To get exposure we need money, and to get money we need results. The best way to promote the sport is to win.&quot;    Ric Purser, the amiable Australian who has coached both the U.S. junior (under21) and senior teams since 1986, emphasizes that long-term goals come before short-term results -- a sentiment at the heart of the FHAA's stepped-up promotional and developmental efforts.    &quot;We used to just pick an all-star team for the big events, and afterward the boys'd all disappear,&quot; says Purser, who's currently in Trinidad and Tobago with his team for the Junior Pan American Games. &quot;Now we choose boys who'll stay with hockey. I'm teaching them how to pass on their knowledge to other people. And I'm teaching them the game as it'll be played 10 years up the track.&quot;    The FHAA's focus on the future couldn't come at a better time. Though men's hockey has been an Olympic event since 1908, an American men's team has competed just five times: in 1932, 1936, 1948, 1956 and 1984. The senior squad appeared at the 1984 Games courtesy of an Olympic rule allowing the host country an entry in each event. It finished dead last.    The U.S. team didn't even qualify for this year's Seoul Olympics, though it did win a bronze medal at last year's Pan Am Games and is now considered one of the world's top 20 teams. And it has a bit of money -- thanks to the very profitable Los Angeles Games. The FHAA got a $38,500 grant from a foundation created with Olympic profits to promote sports in Southern California. It used the grant for a new junior-development program in Southern California dubbed &quot;Minkey,&quot; for minihockey. FHAA officials hope some of the boys who learn hockey through this program will later funnel into existing youth leagues. Before Minkey, most California boys were introduced to the game by FHAA emissaries, who recruit at schools.    The current junior team members missed out on Minkey, which began last year, but they did benefit from Olympic profits in the form of a one-time $1.2 million payment disbursed by the U.S. Olympic Committee. The FHAA has channeled most of the interest from this payment into its operating fund, which covers the team's expenses.    Come 1992, these junior-team members will be experienced competitors -- and no older than 25. But Coach Purser, who can barely contain his enthusiasm for the game, isn't just biding his time until Barcelona.    &quot;We opened some eyes on our recent tour to Australia and New Zealand,&quot; Purser says. &quot;We were beating groups of boys who've been playing hockey for 10 to 12 years. My boys have only been playing for two or three.&quot;    Despite the promise of this junior team and the developmental programs in general, FHAA officials admit resources are thinly spread. For example, the FHAA counts just three full-time administrators, while the U.S. women's national organization has seven.    &quot;Most of the guys who are involved in developing men's hockey have full-time jobs,&quot; explains Bruce Simons, vice president/East of the FHAA. &quot;They're unpaid and overextended.&quot;    Even so, the FHAA, which is based in Colorado Springs, Colo., is extending its reach. It plans to break ground this spring on the East's first field hockey complex (which will also accommodate lacrosse and soccer), on the campus of Drew University in Madison, N.J. The $2.1 million facility is a joint project of Drew University and the men's and women's national hockey organizations, both of which received $250,000 grants toward the project from the U.S. Olympic Foundation.    John K. Greer, immediate past president of the FHAA, says the facility &quot;should really stimulate hockey on the East coast.&quot; He adds that it will serve as the site of the 1989 Fourth Intercontinental Cup, a qualifying tournament for the 1990 World Cup, hockey's top prize along with Olympic gold.    Some junior-team boys may be playing for the seniors by the time the Drew tournament convenes, but you won't see them at next year's Junior World Cup in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Coach Purser's charges needed a gold or silver in Port-of-Spain to qualify, but they'll wind up only fifth or sixth, depending on the results of their remaining games. They beat teams from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Peru, but didn't count on losing 5-0 to Cuba.    &quot;Cuba was an unknown factor,&quot; says Beryl Peterson, national administrator of the FHAA, &quot;and we played them the first match. They just took us by surprise.&quot;    Next on the agenda for the travel-weary juniors: &quot;They'll come right home from Trinidad. A lot of these kids really need to get back to school.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
