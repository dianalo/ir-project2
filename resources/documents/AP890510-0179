Nixon of Mississippi, who is serving a five-yearperjury sentence, and sent the case to the Senate for trial todecide whether he should be ousted from office. The vote was 417-0.   ``Let's get on with this task, unpleasant as it may be, beforehe returns to the bench,'' Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., toldthe House as it acted on the third judicial impeachment case inrecent years.   The three impeachment articles were sent to the Senate for atrial to determine whether Nixon will be removed from office anddeprived of the $89,500 annual salary he has been collecting whileserving his sentence at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.   The Senate currently is holding an impeachment trial for U.S.District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Florida. He was acquitted in1983 on charges of conspiracy to receive a $150,000 bribe butlawmakers are seeking his removal anyway, saying there is ampleevidence.   U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada was impeached bythe House in 1986 while serving a tax evasion sentence and laterremoved from the bench by the Senate.   Nixon was convicted of perjury after denying in 1984 before botha federal grand jury and Justice Department investigators that heintervened in a narcotics case involving the son of Hattiesburgbusiness executive Wiley Fairchild.   Nixon was acquitted of accepting an illegal gratuity in thatcase.   But evidence at his trial and developed in an impeachmentinvestigation by the House was that Nixon discussed the marijuanacase with then-Forrest County District Attorney Paul Holmes.   Fairchild later pleaded guilty to a charge of providing Nixonwith an improper gratuity in 1981, specifically an oil and gasinvestment. Nixon paid with $9,500 in promissory notes andcollected royalties totaling $60,000.   ``There's no doubt that Wylie gave Judge Nixon a sweet deal,''Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., told the House.   The written agreement between the two was backdated one year toa time before Fairchild's son, Hattiesburg Airport manager DrewFairchild, was indicted on charges of helping to smuggle a ton ofmarijuana through the airport.   Nixon's attorneys have argued that many of the answers that hegave to the grand jury were technically correct and that others didnot constitute an impeachable offense.   Nixon has collected more than $286,000 in salary since hisconviction and has been saying that he plans to return to the benchand preside over cases when he is released. Lawmakers said hisrelease could come within a matter of months.   The articles of impeachment said that Nixon ``has raisedsubstantial doubt as to his judicial integrity, underminedconfidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary,betrayed the trust of the people of the United States and broughtdisrepute on the federal courts and the administration of justice.''</TEXT></DOC>
