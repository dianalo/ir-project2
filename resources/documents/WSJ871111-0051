But M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said the board won't arrange any major transactions involving severely troubled Texas thrifts this year, pending completion of a new government study of various approaches to the state's thrift problems.    Regarding Financial Corp., the Irvine, Calif.-based parent of the nation's largest thrift, Mr. Wall indicated that the Bank Board will try to take advantage of the recent drop in interest rates to resolve the company's troubles at a lower cost to the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp.    After taking more than $1 billion in charges to boost loan-loss reserves since August 1984, Financial Corp.'s main unit, American Savings andamp; Loan Association, is more than $900 million short of the level of capital required by regulators. The Bank Board has estimated that resolving Financial Corp.'s problems could cost the FSLIC well in excess of $1 billion.    &quot;In the post market-crash environment, Financial Corp.'s portfolio is significantly stronger than it was before, because it's interest-rate sensitive,&quot; Mr. Wall said at a news conference at the annual convention of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions here. Fixed-rate loans and mortgage-backed securities, whose value rises when interest rates fall, make up the vast bulk of Financial Corp.'s $34 billion of assets.    In a prepared statement, Mr. Wall said the three members of the Bank Board &quot;hope to resolve the FCA situation soon.&quot; Mr. Wall declined to indicate a more specific time. However, Roger Martin, the Bank Board member who has been working on Financial Corp.'s troubles, said in an interview that he interprets &quot;soon&quot; as within one to three months.    Mr. Martin also said that the Bank Board staff hopes to complete by early next week its analysis of proposals by Ford Motor Co. and Citicorp to acquire various units of Financial Corp.    Financial Corp. declined to comment on the statements by Mr. Wall and Mr. Martin.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Financial Corp. closed at $2.75, up 25 cents.    In his speech to thrift executives here, Mr. Wall said the Bank Board hopes to speed up the pace of arranging mergers or acquisitions of insolvent thrifts by healthy institutions or companies outside the thrift industry. &quot;One a week is our goal, and we're going to say, our conservative goal,&quot; Mr. Wall said.    Mr. Wall said the Bank Board has completed 17 such transactions so far this year, and expects to complete an additional 16 transactions by the end of the year.    And although Mr. Wall said some small thrifts in Texas might be involved in mergers or acquisitions before the end of the year, he said no large institutions there would be affected until after the Bank Board's study of the state's thrift problems is completed in early January.    Mr. Wall said the study will involve thrift and business executives from Texas as well as federal thrift-industry regulators.    Mr. Wall said the study was prompted by a flood of investor proposals to acquire troubled Texas thrifts. &quot;We are now stepping back&quot; from specific proposals, he said, to &quot;see what makes sense.&quot;    But the delay in completing big Texas thrift bailouts is likely to make losses even greater for the state's most troubled institutions.    Although interest rates fell recently, the cost of funds for most Texas Sandamp;Ls remains the highest in the nation and loan demand is weak, resulting in continuing losses for the state's weakest institutions. Mr. Wall said those losses are smaller than they would have been without the recent interest rate drop and said the delay shouldn't have any major effect on the government's ability to sell Texas thrifts to investors.    Also in his speech to the thrift executives, Mr. Wall announced a reorganization of top jobs at the FSLIC, which is an arm of the Bank Board. The FSLIC's six operating divisions will be divided into three groups consisting of two divisions each. Each of the three groups will be headed by a deputy executive director, a newly created position. The FSLIC is still without a permanent executive director, a job the Bank Board is seeking to fill.    Mr. Wall also said that Financing Corp., a unit of the Bank Board that raises funds for the FSLIC by selling bonds to the public, plans to sell an additional $400 million to $600 million of bonds in about a week. Last month, the corporation sold a total of $600 million of bonds in a public offering and a private placement. Over the next three years, the corporation has authority to sell $10.83 billion of bonds. </TEXT></DOC>
