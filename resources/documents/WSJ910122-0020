But so far, Carl Reichardt, its chiefexecutive, appears to have skillfully tiptoed through thebanking minefield. And soon he may make a move that wouldconfound his critics.   Mr. Reichardt initiated secret merger negotiations earlylast month with Robert Smith, chief executive of SecurityPacific Corp. of Los Angeles, according to people familiarwith the talks. Such a combination, the largest bank mergerever, would create the nation's second-biggest bank, andperhaps the most profitable. It also might hurt the manyspeculators who, beginning last October, sold short the twocompanies' battered stocks.</LP><TEXT>   Both banks decline to comment, but the talks reached thepoint of sketching out merger terms. Under them, eachcompany's shareholders would own about 50% of the newconcern. And the companies discussed how the 59-year-old Mr.Reichardt would run the merged concern for several yearsbefore turning the reins over to Mr. Smith, 55.   The negotiations were suspended shortly before SecurityPacific announced, on Dec. 10, that it would take a largeloan-loss provision in the fourth quarter and would retreatfrom world-wide banking. The announcement was expected todrive down its stock -- in fact, it eventually did decline --and thus affect the pricing of a merger. However, investmentadvisers close to both sides predict that the talks willresume.   &quot;I believe they said, `Let's talk again,'&quot; one investmentadviser says.   The logic of a merger between Wells Fargo and SecurityPacific -- or, for that matter, among many big banks thatshare markets -- is compelling. Financial-services companiesin general and banks in particular are burdened byovercapacity, and profit margins on most consumer andcorporate lines of business are razor-thin. &quot;Banks needmergers to lower their costs,&quot; says Edward Furash, presidentof Furash andamp; Co., a Washington bank consulting firm. A mergerbetween similar banks in the same area should enable them toeliminate 40% of the expenses of one of the banks, Mr. Furashsays.   Mergers shouldn't deprive borrowers, he adds. &quot;There isusually a rapid increase in the number of small banks in aregion after a large bank merger,&quot; he explains, as new bankscrop up to serve ex-customers of the merged banks who don'thave the same loyalty to a larger bank.   In any event, the loan growth that drives bank earnings islikely to be anemic for years. Meanwhile, many banks aretaking big losses on real-estate loans and will take morelosses on a broad spectrum of other loans if the recessioncontinues. The main opportunity to increase earnings rapidlywould lie in the huge cost savings of intrastate or regionalmergers.   Wells and Security Pacific aren't the only big banksthinking merger. Some analysts have said for months that oneof the four giant New York banks -- Citicorp, ChaseManhattan, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover -- needs tomerge with another to improve earnings. The top fourCalifornia banks are healthier, but the case for similardeals among them is growing as the state's economy weakens.The two states are the country's largest banking markets.Banks in other states will have a tough time trying to mergewith New York and California institutions because suchinterstate combinations can't generate the cost savings thatflow from an intrastate deal.   Major bank mergers have been relatively rare because somebanks have been hurt by loan problems, others blanch at thehuman costs entailed in large layoffs, and, perhaps mostimportant, chief executives can't agree on who will run theshow. &quot;One of the main reasons more mergers haven't occurredcan be summarized in one word: egos,&quot; says Thomas Hanley, ananalyst at Salomon Brothers.   Mr. Hanley thinks &quot;1991 will be the year we seeconsiderable consolidation in banking, especially withinmarkets.&quot; He adds, &quot;The minute it starts, it's going togather a life of its own.&quot;   Once one major player pulls off a merger, competitors willface pressure to consider the same strategy. People close toMr. Reichardt say he believes that banking consolidation andthe resulting job losses are part of an inevitable Darwinianprocess, and the faster it happens, the better off itsvictims will be. They add that he anticipates a wave ofmergers that will meld the top 25 banks into a much smallergroup with more earnings power. In an interview last week,Mr. Reichardt noted, &quot;You will see major bank mergers. That'sone thing we understand well.&quot;   He certainly does. In 1986, under his leadership, WellsFargo purchased Crocker National Corp., another lender basedin San Francisco. He squeezed out cost savings that added anestimated $250 million a year to his bank's operating income,which was $1.5 billion in 1990.   Both Mr. Smith and Mr. Reichardt believe that a merger oftheir banks would allow yearly cost savings of $1 billion to$1.5 billion and create a financial juggernaut with operatingincome rivaling or exceeding that of Citicorp, the nation'sbiggest bank holding company. Theoretically, the addition tonet income from such a merger would, over time, rival WellsFargo's 1990 earnings of $711.5 million.   Some of the savings would come from cutting overlappingoperations such as branches, headquarters staffs anddata-processing facilities. But layoffs would save even more.If the merged bank was as efficient as Wells Fargo is, up to12,000 employees would have to go.   Security Pacific's Mr. Smith, a tall, amiable man, isobviously entranced by what a merger could do for SecurityPacific's earnings. Both he and Mr. Reichardt previouslyexpressed interest in acquiring First Interstate Bancorp, thenation's 10th-largest bank and also based in Los Angeles.Last year Mr. Smith said such an acquisition could be a &quot;homerun,&quot; provided Security Pacific could trim costs by an amountequal to 30% or more of First Interstate's non-interestexpenses. Asked then if that goal was feasible, he simplysmiled.   Security Pacific, the country's fifth-biggest bank, needsa boost. Its strategy of expanding overseas has resulted inbig loan losses in Australia and Britain, necessitating aretreat from both lending and securities dealing in worldmarkets. It has also been wounded as Arizona real-estateloans soured. It took charges of about $800 million in thefourth quarter, reporting a $357.6 million loss. Even in thebest of times, the company's return on assets is onlymoderately above average.   In contrast, Wells Fargo, the 12th largest bank, hasbecome one of the country's two or three most profitablelarge banks. Over eight years, Mr. Reichardt doubled itsreturn on assets and quintupled its net income. A gruff,driving fireplug of a man, he has relentlessly slashedoperating costs and demanded caution while making an unusualamount of lucrative real-estate and highly leveragedtransaction loans, such as those widely used to financetakeovers. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue arethe lowest among big banks. In the past two years, WellsFargo's net loan losses, as a percentage of total loans, wereone-third to one-half those of the other major lenders.   Mr. Reichardt is commonly described as ruthless. Hedislikes that description, but he certainly is tough: He cut4,000 from Crocker's payroll, and associates think hewouldn't hesitate to ax thousands in a merger with SecurityPacific, even though many would be his own people. He demandssuperb performance from his own top and middle managers andkeeps increasing their goals -- so much so that some havequit, complaining of burnout or ill-treatment. Others,however, seem to take pride in Wells Fargo's achievements andesprit de corps.   But Wells Fargo's strategy has come under fire. Asrecession and slumping real-estate values have taken theirtoll, first on banks in the Southwest and lately on those inthe Northeast, some investors are speculating that Californiawill be next. And Wells Fargo has a much higher real-estateexposure than the three other big California banks --BankAmerica Corp., Security Pacific and First Interstate.Such loans, including residential mortgages and home-equityloans, represent 53% of its total portfolio -- roughly ninetimes common equity. BankAmerica's real-estate loans make upabout 35% of its portfolio.   Sensing weakness, short sellers -- speculators who sellborrowed stock in the hope of profiting by later buying it ata lower price to return it to the lender -- have poundedWells Fargo's stock. It has dropped far below its high of$87.50 a share in October 1989. Yesterday, it closed at$54.625 a share, up $2.375. Security Pacific rose 75 cents to$18.875.   Quality of a bank's management is irrelevant &quot;when itcomes to collecting interest from a developer or a companythat has been through a leveraged buy-out, if they don't havethe cash flow,&quot; says Thomas Barton, a general partner inFeshbach Brothers, which manages $900 million and is one ofthe most successful short sellers around. Mr. Barton callsWells Fargo &quot;the most compelling `short' story for a bank orSandamp;L we've ever looked at except the ones that were totalfrauds.&quot;   Some smart investors, such as Berkshire Hathaway's WarrenE. Buffet, think the shorts are wrong. Mr. Buffet bought a9.8% stake in the bank last October.   Wells Fargo's supporters, along with many Wall Streetanalysts, doubt that California will become another Texas andthink Mr. Reichardt is so hard-headed about credit qualitythat he has avoided the pitfalls of real-estate lending.Furthermore, the optimists think the shorts have ignored theearnings bonanza from a merger such as the one Mr. Reichardtsecretly proposed with Security Pacific.   &quot;If there's going to be growth anywhere in the U.S., therewill be growth in California,&quot; predicts Walter Shorenstein,the biggest commercial landlord in San Francisco. &quot;I thinkthe banks here are going to be more stable than East Coastbanks.&quot; Wells Fargo lent him $100 million -- since repaid --to buy the Bank of America building here in 1985.   Many of the most troubled California real-estate projectsappear to have been financed by thrifts, the U.S.subsidiaries of Japanese banks or units of out-of-state U.S.banks, especially Citibank. Although Wells Fargo reported a$232 million jump in nonperforming loans in the fourthquarter, its ratio of nonperforming assets to loans is stillwell below the big-bank average; so are its net loan losses.After the Comptroller of the Currency completed itsinspection of Wells Fargo's real-estate portfolio late lastyear, the bank announced only a modest increase infourth-quarter loan-loss provisions; it added $85 million,compared with $75 million in the third period.   The bank's ability so far to avoid big problems, despiteintensified competition during the development boom of thelate 1980s, boils down to a longstanding formula for makingproperty loans. Mr. Reichardt, bank president Paul Hazen, andreal-estate lending chief David Petrone all joined WellsFargo's real estate investment trust unit in the 1970s afterfinancing corporate and real-estate loans at Union Bank.   They insist that their officers look hard at theborrower's track record, his balance sheet, and only then theproject itself. As a result, the bank's major customers addup to a who's who of California real-estate tycoons. Theyinclude Donald Bren, the billionaire chairman of Irvine Co.,which owns one-sixth of Orange County; William Lyon, theNewport Beach-based owner of the nation's largest homebuilderby volume, and Warren Spieker Jr. of Menlo Park-based SpiekerPartners, who controls a huge West Coast portfolio of officeand industrial buildings.   The loan-approval process, even for these borrowers, neverbecomes automatic. Last year, Mr. Spieker says, Wells refusedto finance a $75 million seniors' housing complex in OrangeCounty that he wanted to build even though two-thirds of theunits had already been presold. The bank's main objection wasthat Mr. Spieker had never built a project of that typebefore. &quot;They are disciplined, and they stick to what theyknow,&quot; he says.   Wells Fargo was also quicker than other banks in puttingon the brakes, even on some of its best borrowers. Last year,the bank told Peter Ochs, the chairman of Fieldstone Group,an Orange County home builder, that it was cutting hisstandard allotment of credit by one-third.   The bank did dozens of industrial real-estate projectswith joint ventures backed by Copley Real Estate Advisors, aunit of New England Mutual Life Insurance Co., in the 1980s.Yet, since 1989, the bank has done no more Copley deals,citing poor market conditions. Copley through variouspartnerships is still one of the bank's biggest borrowers,with a cumulative loan balance of about $600 million.   The bank's loan growth comes through repeat businessrather than taking chances on newcomers. Instead of knockingon doors to drum up new business, its loan officers are urgedto spend time attending customers' weekly staff meetings tolearn every detail of their businesses.   If California's current real-estate weakness does turninto full-blown deflation, none of the state's banks will beimmune. Indeed, Wells Fargo seems to have begun to feel apinch. Overbuilding is leading to historically high vacancyrates in some parts of the state, notably downtown LosAngeles, which is now at 20% and rising fast. Although WellsFargo shied away from office projects there, it did reportlast week that it holds about $1 billion in commercialreal-estate loans on properties that are at least 25% empty.Total loans as of Dec. 31, 1990, were $49 billion.   Mr. Hanley, the Salomon analyst, cut his 1991 earningsestimate from $12.75 a share to $10.50 on Jan. 15 after thebank disclosed flat fourth-quarter results.   Mr. Reichardt remains confident. &quot;I'm happy with the loanswe have but not with the perception everyone has that theyare bad,&quot; he says. &quot;Since 1852, I can't find a time when wehave lost money. We've paid a dividend continuously since the1870s. In my 20 years at the bank, the bank has neverproduced a big surprise.&quot;   Perhaps a merger with Security Pacific will be the first.   ---   Fred R.
