 It is the cornerstoneof Digital's knowledge network vision: a numbe of expert systems embedded inboth the company's order process cycle and its new product introductioncycle.andP;  Today, network, as well as using expert systems technology in manyadditional aspects of the company's business.andP;  In fact, XCON is only one ofseveral expert systems dealing with hardware and software configuration whichae currently in use or under development at Digital.andP;  The configurationsystems &quot;family&quot; includes four expert systems in production use.andP;  Severaladditional configuration expert systems are in the research, advanceddevelopment, or prototype stage of development.andM;The development of these expert systems has spanned nearly 10 years;Digital's Configuration systems Development Group (CSDG) has thereby gainedconsiderable understanding of all phases of the lifecycle of productionquality expert systems: design, development, production, and ongoing support.andO;In this article we highlight some of the key lessons we have learned:andM;* Building a successful expert system involves much more than simply puttingrules into a knowledge base.andP;  Rather, to successfully develop and provideongoing support for expert systems and to integrate them into the fabric ofone's business, as has been done at Digital, one must attend to the needs ofthe business and to human resource and organizational issues as well as totechnical issues.andM;* Although many software engineering practices carry over to the engineeringof expert systems, we have nonetheless needed to be creative in developingpractices specifically tuned to this relatively new, and still evolving,technology.andM;While the accompanying article by Bachant and Soloway focuses specifically onthe technical issues underlying XCON  and the other configuration systems, wetake a more holistic, integrative approach in this article and attempt to putthe aforementioned concerns into a coherent perspective.andM;CONFIGURATION SYSTEMS AT DIGITAL TODAYandM;THE digital Configuration Systems Timeline (p.andP;  302) shows, for each of theconfiguration systems, key stage-of-life milestones, including initialproduction use where appropriate.andM;XCON is used to validate the technical correctness (configurability) ofcustomer orders and to guide the actual assembly of these orders.andP;  Itprovides the following functionality:andM;* Configures CPUS, memory, boxes, backplanes, cabinets, and power supplies,disks, tapes, HSC/CI, printers, etc.andM;* Diagrams complete system configuration (Figure 1 overlays selected pages ofa sample XCON diagram)andM;* Checks marketing restrictions, system building block menus, andprerequisitesandM;* Assigns addresses/Vectors and determines box power statusandM;* Partitions multiple-cpu orders and cluster systemsandM;* Determines and lists cabling informationandM;* Lists components ordered with configuration-related commentsandM;* Generates warning messages on issue affecting technical validity.andM;XSEL [7, 9] is uses interactively to assist in the selection of saleableparts which make up a customer order.andP;  It provides the followingfunctionality:andM;* Allows interactive selection by generic component name, partial or fullmodel numberandM;* Performs completeness checking, adding and suggesting required partsandM;* Checks software compatibility, prerequisites, license and mediacompletenessandM;* Checks standard and system building block menus, marketing and engineeringrestrictionsandM;* Provides computer room environmental data and requirementsandM;* Links to Automated Quotation System.andM;XFL is used to diagram a computer room floor layout for teh configuration(s)under consideration.andP;  It provides the following functionality:andM;* Provides &quot;minimum footprint&quot; floor layout of componentsandM;* Allows custom rooms (user-specified dimensions and placement)andM;* Can include several configurations or a cluster in one site layout.andM;XCLUSTER is used to assist in configuring clusters.andP;  It provides thefollowing functionality:andM;* Clusters multiple-node configurations for validationandM;* Specific device quantity for dual portingandM;* Upgrades appropriate clusterable tapes.andM;In addition to these four systems currently in production use, two otherconfiguration systems are under development:andM;XNET is an expert system which will be used to design local area networks, toselect appropriate components for such networks, and to validate thetechnical correctness of the resultant network configurations.andM;SIZER is a research effort addressing the need for tools to assist in thesizing of computing resources required for any of a wide variety of uses invarious types of organizations.andM;To support the ongoing development of the configuration systems in productionuse and to enable us to more effectively build new configuration systems, wehave developed a software engineering methodology, called RIME [1, 12, 13],expressly for expert systems.andP;  Because RIME provides substantial insight intothe engineering issues that require particular attention in building expertsystems, it is discussed at some length in &quot;The Engineering of  XCON.&quot;andM;SCOPE AND USAGEandM;The configuration systems provide full product coverage for Digital's currentproduct set.andP;  This product set today consists of 42 different families ofcentral processor types and their supporting peripherals and software.andP;  Inorder to be useful business tools, released versions of these systems mustinclude configuration knowledge of Digital's newest products by the time ofproduct announcement.andP;  In practice, this means that CSDG provides majorreleases of these systems once each quarter, with at least one interimupgrade to insure adherence to the time-of-announcement requirement.andM;Hardware and software configuration is at the core of Digital's business.andO;The configuration systems are used worldwide, throughout the corporation, bya broad set of users across the company's major functions: sales,manufacturing, field service, and engineering.andP;  The users of these systemsperform functions which span Digital's complete order flow and manufacturingcycle, and, thus, are involved with many different business processes.andP;  Thisis a large and varied constituency to support--each has different needs andtakes a different perspective on the configuration information provided:andM;* Sales uses the configuration systems as an integral part of the automatedprocess to generate quotations for customers, and to insure that every orderis technically valid.andM;* Manufacturing uses the information to verify buildability of all incomingorders, to understand physical partitioning of an order into varioussub-assemblies to determine which plants should build which segments of anorder, to guide the assembly of all orders, to determine the optimal set ofdiagnostics to run on each order.andM;* Field service has the perspective of consolidation and assembly of theorder in the customr's unique environment and possibly with existingequipment already installed.andM;* Manufacturing and engineering benefit from the configuration system's focuson system integration, as analysis of product knowledge for inclusion in theconfiguration systems identifies potential problems in system-level designand manufacturability.andM;This user profile has expanded dramatically over the years (see timeline).andO;For example, the initial purpose of XCON was to assist manufacturing plantpersonnel in validating the technical correctness of system orders about tobe built.andP;  since then, this technical validation function has changed inresponse to business needs and is now performed in the field as well.andP;  Inaddition, the technicians in the plants who build the computers now use XCONdiagrams to see how to put the systems together, and they include thosediagrams in the shipment to the customer for use by field service installersat the customer site.andP;  XSEL was originally designed for use by salesrepresentatives, and is now used by our OEM customes as well.andP;  Implementationof XNET will add specialized field support personnel to the user list in thenear future.andP;  There are additional &quot;indirect&quot; users of these systems throughautomated linkages to other software systems (both traditional and expertsystems) which depend on the configuration information supplied.andM;The configuration systems user base not only represents over 10 distinctbusiness functions, but is also spread across the world, and has variedgeography-specific needs.andP;  Overall, CSDG supports over 50 productioninstallation sites, and the number is growing.andP;  In sum, then, theconfiguration systems are firmly embedded in Digital's most critical businessprocesses.andP;  The existence of these expert systems has significantly improvedthese processes and continues to provide insight into opportunities for thefuture.andM;BENEFITSandM;Only a modest amount of attention has been given to documenting the benefitsof applying expert systems technology [3, 8].andP;  The configuration systems area success and there is a major dependency on them within the corporation,worldwide.andP;  They benefit Digital in a number of ways, contributing tocustomer satisfaction, lower costs, and higher productivity.andP;  These systemsare recognized as a critical factor in Digital's ability to maintain itshighly successful a la carte, build-to-order marketing strategy (customizedconfigurations to fit each customer's specific needs); this is one of thecompany's key competitive advantages.andP;  Some of the benefits are difficult toquantify, but overall the net return to Digital is estimated to be in excessof $40 million per year.andM;The use of the configuration systems insures that complete, consistentlyconfigured systems are shipped to the customer.andP;  Incomplete orders do not getthrough the process.andP;  In addition, XCON generates configurations whichoptimize system performance, so customers consistently get the best view ofour products.andP;  Before the configuration systems, we would often ship the sameparts configured differently.andP;  (There are multiple ways to configure the sameof parts to create a working system.)andP;  This was a major source of customercomplaints and confusion, especially for OEM's who order large numbers of thesame system and in turn reconfigure them all in the same way as part of theirmarket-specific value added process.andM;The process of new product introduction is enhanced greatly by the focus onconfiguration information provided by the configuration systems.andP;  Theexistence of a single source of configuration information by the time ofproduct announcement for use on initial customer orders simplifies field andmanufacturing training needs and avoids confusion about new products whichcan delay time-to-market significantly.andP;  This is of critical importance giventhe volume of new products Digital continues to introduce each year.andP;  Thissingle source of configuration information also increases manufacturing'sflexibility by enabling product manufacture (and the knowledge of how it isdone) to be moved from one plant to another without costly training ordisruptive re-assignment of people.andP;  The use of XCON has facilitated thisre-alignment of manufacturing capacity several times.andM;The use of the configuration systems has significantly increased thetechnical accuracy of orders entering manufacturing.andP;  Straightening outproblem orders is a costly and time-consuming activity which disrupts thenormal processes and increases order cycle time (i.e., delays ordershipment).andP;  Overall, the additional discipline of both field andmanufacturing use of these systems has shortened cycle times, contributed tomore flexible, smoother-running processes, and lowered the number of peoplewho would otherwise be needed for a given volume of orders.andM;XCON is seen as a critical component of Digital's current process of shippingsegments of an order from various component plants, to consolidation points,and from there to the customer site.andP;  The use of XCON throughout themanufacturing process assures that when the components of the order cometogether for the first time at the customer site the system will work.andO;Before the use of XCON, there were special manufacturing plants where everycustomer order was completely assembled, tested, dissassembled, and repackedprior to shipping in order to insure the system would work when installed atthe customer site.andP;  The elimination of this step in the manufacturing process(called Final Assembly and Test) has had a major positive impact on cycletimes, inventory levels, and manufacturing costs, especially in light ofDigital's four-fold increase in systems product volume since 1980.andM;Thus, the configuration systems are key in Digital's ability to handle theproduct complexity that technology advanced are enabling and that ourcustomers are demanding.andM;THE CONFIGURATION SYSTEMS EXPERIENCEandM;At Digital, we believe that our success in the application of expert systemstechnology is attributable to a conscious recognition of and careful balanceamong three important perspectives: strategic/business, technical, and humanresource/organizational.andM;STRATEGIC/BUSINESS ISSUESandM;Digital has reaped and continues to reap enormous benefits from theconfiguration systems.andP;  It was, of course, an experimental effort at firstbut it was nurtured and allowed to progress and turned out to be a resoundingsuccess.andP;  Now Digital considers its use of expert systems technology astrategic investment.andM;What are the characteristics of an appropriate business problem for this typeof strategic investment in a new technology?andP;  The problem must be real andsystemic to the enterprise to justify the right kind of nurturing andsupportive business environment.andP;  The solution will probably impact multipleorganizations or functions and, hopefully, will bring about significant andpositive changes in the way the enterprise operates.andP;  The configurationproblem at Digital certainly qualifies.andP;  Digital's strategy of sellingcustomized solutions is one of its critical competitive advantages, and givesrise to an indefinit number of valid configurations of its product set.andP;  Inthe 1970s, problems with handling this were starting to surface, and it wasunderstood that automated support would be critically important as salesvolumes increased and products became more varied and complex.andM;One of the main challenges we have encountered in developing systems whichsupport strategic, cross-functional business needs, is sorting out how thetechnologists connect with the business.andP;  As with any software developmenteffort, it is necessary to form a solid partnership with the business beingsupported.andP;  Usually, that means with the end users and their immediate,operational management.andP;  In the case of strategic, cross-functional systems,we have discovered that the development effort must also be tightly connectedat a more strategic level of management.andP;  This is simply a reflection of thefact that the problem being addressed has strategic impact and the solutionmay include and/or provide opportunities for fa-reaching changes in thebusiness [6] of which the tactically focused end user groups may be unaware.andM;CSDG is tapped into business planning at several levels to insure adequateawareness and connectivity and support.andP;  This has been and continues to be ofcritical importance to the ongoing success of the configuration effort atDigital.andP;  Much of the strategic connectivity over the years has been informalfor the configuration systems effort: based on personal relationships withkey individuals.andP;  Recently, we have initiated some efforts to formalize someof these processes.andP;  For example, we have set up a Configuration SystemsSteering Committee made up of strategically focused managers representing ourvarious business constituencies.andP;  This forum provides guidance on planningand priority-setting for the configuration systems in the context of across-functional vision looking out several years.andP;  In addition, a moreformal corporate-level focus on system integration issues is evolving, whichshould provide formal long-term direction.andM;One of the most important factors in our success has been the existence of anenabling business/development environment for the introduction of newtechnologies like expert systems.andP;  During the early 1980s, Digital'smanufacturing operations were open to embracing new ideas and technologiesthat would help them change the way work was done, affording higherproductivity and shorter cycle times in response to customer requirements.andO;Further, it was believed that this expert system technology could help shapethe way Digital did business, allow the company functions to managecomplexity, preserve the knowledge of its experts, and provide an approach toexception management more consistent with its growth demands.andP;  An environmenthas been provided which has nurtured the emerging technology and recognizedthat the people involved are managing change, evolution, and significantlearning.andP;  It is understood that there will be new and changing operatingnorms and success criteria over time.andP;  Thus, at Digital there has been realmanagement commitment to helping the technology succeed in helping thebusiness progress.andM;TECHNICAL ISSUESandM;Technologies develop iteratively through a number of phases:andM;* Investigation and experimentation,andM;* Stabilization with limitations,andM;* Identification of opportunities for optimization, andandM;* Maturity.andM;No aspects of expert systems technology have really reached maturity yet.andO;This need not be an impediment to its successful use, but it must beunderstood and proper expectations must be set.andP;  In a new and emergingtechnology, there are many opportunities for technical creativity as newdiscoveries and capabilities surface.andP;  There is also the likelihood that aserious application development effort will push at the limits of what thetechnology has to offer at a particular point in time, and in so doing, cancontribute greatly to the further development of that technology.andM;Technology ChallengesandM;The main challenges stemming from the emerging nature of this technology are:andM;1.andP;  Dealing creatively with the current limitations of the specializedlanguages and tools, andandM;2.andP;  Formulating an appropriate software engineering methodology (this is thethrust of the RIME development effort) to produce efficient, maintainable,extensible expert systems.andM;Today's expert systems languages (and shells) offer varied but somewhatlimited functionality.andP;  Most do not provide true extensibility to aproduction environment.andP;  There are very few knowledge engineeringproductivity tools available as yet on the market.andP;  The OPS5 language wasoriginally chosen for the development of R1, the forebear of XCON.andP;  As XCONand the other configuration systems have evolved using VAX opS5, its strongpattern-matching capability and its speed have maintained it as our languageof choice over all others on the market today.andP;  CSDG has directly influencedthe development of VAX OPS5, based on our experience, and continues to do so.andM;Bachant and Soloway introduce a software engineering methodology appropriatefor the development of expert systems.andP;  They make two primary points: (1) Atask such as XCON's, where thousands of highly context-dependent decisionsmust be made in order to correctly configure a system, can take advantage ofa language, like OPS5, that presupposes &quot;situation recognition&quot; rather than&quot;algorithmic&quot; control.andP;  (2) But, as the number of alternatives that an expertsystem must decide among becomes large, there is strong motivation to augmentsituation recognition with other kinds of control mechanisms.andP;  RIME, asoftware engineering methodology developed within CSDG, identifies threemechanisms that an OPS5 program can use to determine what to do and when todo it.andP;  This methodology, which was first used to reimplement XCON, hasproven beneficial in the management of complexity and facilittation ofchange.andM;Testing, by traditional standards, is a major problem for expert systems.andO;Can you test an expert system the way you evaluate a human expert?andP;  Since theunderstanding of the business problem is often enhanced over time by the useof the expert system, how can you define a set of tests that are sure to berelevant from one release to the next?andP;  Since there are, typically, anindeterminate number of paths through an expert system, it is not possible toexhaustively test all scenarios.andP;  What is correctness?andP;  Consider therelationship between the optimal solution and an accurate solution.andP;  An errorcan be difficult to distinguish from a wish-list item.andP;  The expert system maycome up with the right answer, but for the wrong reasons.andP;  What about thecases where the experts disagree?andP;  There are other related issues as well,all of which cry out for new views of design-for-testability and new testingcencepts, methods, and tools.andP;  This is assuredly an area which needs moreattention, and we hope to devote more energy to this in the future.andM;Application ChallengesandM;There are three application characteristics which are major contributors tothe challenges faced in expert systems development:andM;1.andP;  Volatile subject domain,andM;2.andP;  Expanding functional scope, andandM;3.andP;  Large system size and complexity.andM;These are primary characteristics of the configuration systems, and havepresented us with our toughest challenges over the years: (1) computerconfiguration is a dynamic subject domain; (2) once the systems were viewedas successful business support tools, users have wanted more and more fromthem; and (3) the configuration systems have become very large and aredealing with increasingly complex information relationships.andP;  Success hascome only from our ability to respond to these challenges without disruptingor degrading the accuracy of the systems or our predictability in providingregular production releases.andM;VolatilityandM;Each year, about 40 percent of the rules in the configuration systemsknowledge base change (this includes rule additions and deletions, as well asmodifications).andP;  This rate of change in the engineering, manufacturing, andmarketing rules is due to a number of factors.andP;  Digital offers severalhundred major new products and many more &quot;minor&quot; ones each year.andO;Configuration information about them all must be included in theconfiguration systems knowledge base.andP;  In addition, sometimes knowledge abouthow to configure existing products must be changed to incorporate theirconfigurability with new ones.andP;  Also, existing products are oftenre-packaged, as dictated by engineering, marketing, or government regulation.andO;And, finally, CSDG periodically re-writes focused sets of rules as more islearned about the configuration of a particular product set and how torepresent the knowledge more effectively.andM;There is another dimension of volatility in the configuration domain: thescope of the configuration task itself has changed significantly.andP;  Thecomplexity and flexibility of Digital's product strategies has increasedsteadily since XCON was first designed.andP;  A single computer system can nolonger be configured in isolation, but must be considered in relation to itsrole in a cluster or network.andP;  Clusters and networks offer multiple ways ofconfiguring computers and connecting devices.andP;  Cluster and networkconnections are coming to be thought of as the main bus, with systems anddevices providing functionality for one large &quot;solution system.&quot;andP;  Moreover,distinctions between systems and devices are becoming less clear.andP;  Theconfiguration-related  interdependencies between hardware and software aremuch more numerous and complex today.andP;  In summary, the basic concepts andcomponents of the configuration domain are being redefined continuously.andM;ExpansionandM;The configuration systems we have noted serve increasingly varied user groupsfrom different business functions and geographies.andP;  New types of users withnew perspectives generate new requirements which frequently enlarge thefunctional scope of the systems.andP;  For example, when the plant techniciansbegan to use the XCON diagram as the official document from which toconstruct the computer, a whole new set of requirements was generated.andP;  CSDGmade an architectural change to the system in order to support these needs(altering some of the knowledge representation, transitioning functionalitybetween the OPS5 rules and non-OPS5 code to create the diagrams, anddeveloping a specialized database).andM;As their businesses change, existing users have discovered new and differentways to use the configuration systems.andP;  For example, as orders volumes haveincreased and the technical validation function has changed, those users wantto interact with the tool in different ways and need different kinds ofinformation from the systems.andP;  They have asked for more stream-lined ways toaccess the XCON results, as their processes have changed to preclude the needfor steps previously performed and reflected in the XCON menu access scheme.andM;When XCON started feeding information to other systems, there have beeninstances where the rules have had to be changed to accommodate a newperspective on the configuration information.andP;  For example, there is anotherexpert system used in manufacturing which helps judge how to split theconstruction of the order across several plants which specialize in certainsub-assemblies [4].andP;  This system needs information from XCON on the physicalpartitioning of the order and what parts are used in what sub-assembly.andP;  XCONrules had to be changed to be able to explicitly provide this information atan intermediate point in XCON's overall process.andM;We learned that once we were successful, our users expected more.andP;  Users havehigher expectations of a successful, operational system.andP;  Scrutiny hasshifted from the accuracy of the knowledge base to things like ease of use,seamless integration with other software systems, etc.andP;  CSDG is in theprocess of re-designing the user interface across the full family ofconfiguration systems, to make it more flexible and less cumbersome forusers.andP;  Part of this effort includes a new interface architecture which willalso respond to the increasing demand for more flexible, straightforwardinterfaces to other software systems.andP;  Also, various system functionspreviously considered luxuries, now become requirements.andP;  This can beanything from cosmetic features to customized output for differentmanufacturing plants.andM;Size and ComplexityandM;The configuration systems are large and technically complex.andP;  We will discussthis from the perspective of the rule bases, the databases, and thetraditional software programs and routines which make up the systems.andP;  It ishoped that this will give some perspective on the dimensions along which anexpert system must be managed technically.andP;  Figure 2 gives a simplified viewof the current configuration systems architecture (i.e., the systems'functional components and their interrelationships), focusing only on thesystems in production use.andM;RULE BASES: The configuration systems rule bases are written in VAX OPS5.andO;The specific rule counts (as of September, 1988) for each expert system arefollows: XCON  10129 XSEL  3629 XFL  1808 XCLUSTER  243 XNET (prototype) 1700andM;Rule count alone is an inadequate characterization of a rule-based expertsystem.andP;  Representational complexity is another important dimension and canbe summarized for the configuration systems as follows:andM;* Average number of condition elements per rule (the &quot;if&quot; portion of a rule,must be satisfied for the rule to activate)andM;* Average number of attributes per condition element (tests, patterndimensions, a measure of the amount of detail in each condition element)andM;* Average number of action elements per rule (the &quot;then&quot; portion of a rule,actions to be taken when rule is activated)andM;Thus, on average, the number of tests that each rule must make on each cycleto determine whether it is applicable is 6 X 5 = 30.andM;DATABASES: The configuration systems include five databases.andM;The component database contains configuration information on over 30,000parts.andP;  There are from 25 to 125 attributes per part, with an average ofabout 40, depending on the type of part.andP;  There are over 40 types of parts;for example, cabinets, cables, controllers, disks, processors, tapes.andP;  Thisis a compiled database, memory-resident, compressed, with multiple indices.andM;The container-template database contains information on certain types ofparts (e.g., backplanes) which describes their containership characteristics(e.g., number and size slots).andP;  There are over 725 such templates.andP;  Thisdatabase is technically structured in the same way as the component database.andM;The diagram-template database contains over 1,200 graphical representationsof the major types of parts (e.g., cabinets, boxes, backplanes), for use inthe XCON output diagrams.andP;  This database is a combination of anapplication-specific file system and text libraries.andM;The question-template database contains over 1,000 questions used by XSEL,XFL, and XCLUSTER when interacting with the user.andP;  The following examplesused in XSEL are illustrative:andM;* This configuration is not complete without media for your VMS license.andP;  Ifyou already have media on another system, you do not have to add it here.andP;  Doyou have another system with appropriate media?andM;* How many of your terminals will be connected locally to a communicationdevice or terminal server?andM;This database is made up of an application-specific file system.andM;The configuration database holds the user input (e.g., line items) and systemoutput (e.g., XCON diagrams) on each configuration or order entered into thesystem for processing.andP;  The content and number of these databases varies byproduction installation site.andP;  This is a VAX DBMS database structuredaccording to the CODASYL network model.andM;TRADITIONAL SOFTWARE: A significant portion of the configuration systems(over 350 programs/routines and over 50,000 lines of code) are written intraditional languages best suited for the specific input, output, filehandling, etc.andP;  tasks being performed.andP;  This is summarized as: BASIC  Userinterface and related mechanisms C Component database access BLISS  Componentdatabase access and creation PASCAL  XCON batch control MACRO  Transfervectors SCAN Pre-specified systems selectionandM;In addition, a number of routines written in traditional languages are calledfrom OPS5 to perform a variety of tasks such as counting, sorting, andvarious numeric conversions.andM;Managerial ImplicationsandM;In managing the configuration systems development effort, we have found itimportant to pay particular attention to several key areas impacted by thevarious technical challenges previously discussed.andM;We have learned that it is imperative that the development effort be in thecontext of a stated overall system architecture (such as that in Figure 2) atany point in time.andP;  From that we have an explicit understanding of what partsof the systems use expert system technology and what parts do not; of howthose different parts must interact and how that interaction will becontrolled; of what kinds of databases are needed and how they integrate; ofperformance implications of the architecture; etc.andP;  These are basic softwareengineering norms which we believe do apply to expert systems work.andP;  In theearly years, we did not have an explicit architecture; the systems wereconsidered fluid and evolving and to some degree everything was experimental.andO;But we quickly discovered that without the context and discipline which anarchitecture provides, there is no way to insure that growth in system sizeand complexity can be managed successfully.andP;  Indeed, we have changed and arestill changing the configuration systems architecture, sometimessignificantly, to reflect their ongoing evolution.andP;  As our experience grows,we gain more insight into the relative importance of different designprinciples.andM;We are always concerned about maintainability.andP;  Only with a great deal ofeffort and the utilization of periodic relevant advances in the technology,have we been able to keep the configuration systems viable.andP;  The learningcurve for new developers in CSDG has been as high as 12 months.andP;  People wehire are typically not experienced in OPS5, do not know the computerconfiguration task, and have no technical knowledge of the configurationsystems.andP;  It takes a long time for even an experienced software engineer tobecome adept enough in all three of these areas of expertise to have a netpositive impact on the group (i.e., for their contribution to outweigh thedrain on others of training them).andP;  We are shrinking this learning curve byusing Digital's two-month AI Training Program, by providing specializedconfiguration training of our own, and by using a fairly structured,step-wise approach to integrating new developers.andP;  The RIME methodology isexpected to have a major impact on the developer learning curve, by making itmuch easier to become familiar with the systems through the explicitrepresentational structure it provides.andP;  In addition, the RIME methodologyreduces the problems of system changes having unexpected impacts andfacilitates catching certain kinds of bugs.andM;Maintainability is also affected by the allowable cycle time from acquiringnew knowledge to releasing the systems; the dynamic nature of Digital'sproduct set makes it difficult to optimize the frequency of our releases.andO;Our users need access to configuration information as soon as new productsare announced.andP;  Time-to-market is getting shorter and shorter in the computerindustry, and Digital announces a large number of new products each year.andO;This leaves CSDG with very little time to gather and incorporate productconfiguration knowledge into the configuration systems.andP;  CSDG currentlyprovides quarterly releases with interim upgrades as needed to incorporatemajor new products by the time they are announced.andM;For expert systems, we believe that tool development must go hand-in-handwith the development of the application programs to insure success withsystems in production use--where operating efficiency, reliability, andproductivity are so important.andP;  We have come to realize the need forhome-grown developer tools if what is needed is not otherwise available, andthat there is a support cost involved for such tools.andP;  Over the years, CSDGhas developed or influenced the development of tools to provide thefollowing:andM;* OPS5 workstation environment,andM;* Code (including rules) management,andM;* Rule compilation,andM;* Rule checking,andM;* Specialized database management,andM;* Automatic testing, andandM;* On-line user problem reporting and feedback.andM;These tools have been critical to the success of the configuration systemsand a major factor for us in enhancing both maintainability and developerproductivity.andM;CSDG is constantly balancing short-term and long-term tradeoffs.andP;  Is thedevelopment effort a testbed for research breakthroughs, new tools, newlanguage releases, new engineering methodologies?andP;  Or is it a production&quot;shop,&quot; requiring consistent levels of quality, predictability, timeliness,and reliability?andP;  For us, it is very definitely both.andP;  We constantly work atmaintaining a manageable balance.andP;  This is an art, not a science, and webelieve it is one of the most critical factors in succeeding at developingexperts for production use.andP;  If we swing too far toward the production side,our systems will run aground from lack of technological breakthrough andinnovation.andP;  We will hit the limits of existing technology.andP;  If we swing toofar toward the testbed side, our systems will fail from putting too manyresources on experimentation and investment, and not enough on satisfyingtoday's user needs and dependencies.andM;HUMAN RESOURCE/ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUESandM;In an evolutionary environment, where managing change and managing learningare the name of the game (that is, where lack of norms is the norm.andP;  .  . andO;.), there are bound to be human resource and organizational challenges.andP;  Theformula for success is to put energy into managing these challenges.andP;  For us,this has meant: be aware of the players and their roles and needs; identifythe tasks, the processes, and the organizational structures needed to makethe effort an ongoing success; and pay attention to the shifting sands--besensitized to the impacts of the effort on people; notice when things arechanging or should be changed.andM;Key RolesandM;On the human resource side, clarity of roles is always an important factor.andO;Based largely on the configuration systems experience, we have developed amodel of the various key roles involved in an expert system developmenteffort.andP;  This model reflects a broad perspective on involvement.andP;  It is amodel of functions, not individuals; that is, one individual may play morethan one role at any particular point in time, or one role may be played bymore than one individual.andP;  The roles as follows:andM;* The CHAMPION has strategic vision, a belief in what the technology canoffer, political savvy, the ability to influence and/or provide a supportive,enabling environment, and influence over the sponsor.andM;* The SPONSOR has ownership of the business problem or vision, commitment tosolve that problem or reach that vision, organizational stature and support,the appropriate resources (funding), and an understanding of managing change.andM;* The PROGRAM MANAGER is an integration role responsible for the overallgoodness and demployment of the program, has more of a business than atechnical focus, and manages the interfaces among the players.andM;* The TECHNICAL TEAM consists of two development roles:andM;The KNOWLEDGE ENGINEER is the expert system technologist role whicharchitects the AI portion of the system and performs the knowledgeacquisition, knowledge representation, and knowledge base development andtesting tasks; and does so using a rapid prototyping, iterative developmentprocess.andM;The SOFTWARE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION ENGINEER is the more traditional softwareengineering role which owns the overall system architecture; designs anddevelops the traditional technology portions of the system (I/O-system anduser and database interfaces, file handling, etc.); designs, developes, andmanages the development environment (tools, hardware/software setup, etc.);andO;performs release management tasks; and supports installed base systemmanagers.andM;* The EXPERTS provide domain knowledge in terms of both the process ofperforming the task and the data content, as well as quality assurance,verification support.andM;* The USERS provide business knowledge in terms of the organization of thework being affected, how the system will fit into the current or futurebusiness process, and relevant job satisfaction issues.andM;It should be noted that in some cases the experts and the users may be thesame people, but in other cases they may be different people, perhaps even indifferent parts of the company.andP;  For configuration systems, the primaryexperts are hardware design engineers and manufacturing engineers, whereasthe primary users are salespersons, technical order validaters, andmanufacturing build technicians.andM;We have found it important to look periodically at which roles are filled forthe configuration systems effort and which are not.andP;  These things change overtime, and some changes have caught us by surprise.andP;  The exercise includesassesing the impact of any gaps or holes which may be discovered, determiningthe exposure, and deciding what to do.andP;  At different points in thedevelopment cycle, we have found different roles may be more or lesscritical, but it has paid off for us to make those relative strengthassessments consciously.andM;In expert systems development, it can be easy to get so focused on whetherthe technology can adequately address the problem and how to present theknowledge effectively that the users' perspective gets inadequate attention.andO;This happened in the early years of XCON and it took us several years to getback on track with the users in manufacturing.andP;  The expert system applicationexists to support a business need and be useable within the context of theappropriate business processes--the problem has not been solved until theusers are using the system effectively.andP;  This is no different than intraditional software application development.andM;One way we have found to avoid this kind of imbalance is to set up clearlydefined accountability relationships among the key roles.andP;  (Note thataccountability does not necessarily imply a direct organizational reportingrelationship.)andP;  There are many possible models of accountability anddifferent ones will be more appropriate than others in different companies oron different projects.andP;  For us, the following relationships have beencritical:andM;* The program manager must feel accountable to the sponsor and to the users.andM;* The technical team must feel responsible to the program manager.andM;* Users are probably ultimately accountable to the sponsor as part of thenormal business structure.andM;* The champion may not have an accountability relationship with the other keyroles.andM;*he same may be true with the experts--although, this can cause difficultiesif a lot of their time is required working with knowledge engineers,especially in ongoing knowledge acquisition efforts.andM;Key Role EvolutionandM;For us, the nature of these key roles has evolved over time, as thedevelopment effort has passed through various stages, when organizationalgrowth has necessitated a re-evaluation of roles, and especially as eachsystem went into production use.andP;  We have tried to understand and monitorthis process as the development effort has proceeded.andP;  We have discoveredthat the incumbents may need help in understanding the change and feelingcomfortable with it.andP;  In some cases, different people may be more suited tofill the roles.andP;  What we observed and learned from the configuration systemsexperience is generalized and summarized below:andM;The SPONSOR and CHAMPION ROLES DO NOT EVOLVE per se, but it is important toknow that it takes to keep them supportive: maintain an understanding oftheir mission and the role expert systems can play, stay connected to theirvision (if may change over time), keep them informed, and above all &quot;deliverthe goods&quot; (this can include small successes along the way).andP;  Depending onthe breadth of the expert system's applicability, there may eventually bemore than one sponsor or champion.andP;  For the configuration systems, there arenow several champions and a number of sponsors (representing the variousconstituencies and funding sources).andM;The PROGRAM MANAGER role evolution reflects the likelihood that a successfulexpert system will be visible, impact multiple functions and support a higherlevel of integration within the company.andP;  the emphasis may shift from asingle project to a multi-project program, from setting schedules to settingexpectations, from working tasks to working relationships, from providingindividual contribution to motivating cooperation.andP;  A PROGRAM OFFICE mayevolve to support the program manager, consisting of business analysts andimplementation planning specialists.andP;  For the configuration systems, thereare two program offices, one which supports the field users and one whichsupport the manufacturing users.andM;The TECHNICAL TEAM may grow to a size where a DEVELOPMENT or ENGINEERINGMANAGER is needed.andM;The KNOWLEDGE ENGINEER may evolve from an individual contributor to a leaderof multiple expert system technologists, may operate less in discovery modeand more in adaptive mode as the problem becomes better understood and thesystem designs is established, and may become less of a novice and more of anexpert in the subject domain.andP;  CSDG's most experienced knowledge engineersare recognized within the company as configuration experts.andM;The SOFTWARE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION ENGINEER role gets bigger and more complexas the system grows and broadens in scope, as the development environmentmust expand to support a larger technical team, as integration withtraditional technology becomes more important, and as the system goes intoproduction use.andP;  In the early years of the configuration systems effort, theimportance of this role was inadequately understood and it was understaffedduring some critical periods; it took us a long time to overcome the negativeimpacts on the operation.andM;The RESEARCHERS/ADVANCED DEVELOPER is an optional role which evolves from asuccess base and deals with initial application of new technologyopportunities to the subject domain through major redesign of existingsystems or major new system development.andP;  This role can consist of a team ofknowledge engineers and software system integration engineers, as applicable.andO;Within CSDG, both the RIME and XNET development efforts have been spearheadedby such teams.andM;The EXPERT role will always be to provide domain knowledge, but over timethere will be additional emphasis on their influence on the system design andon the insight they gain from the technical team into the task beingsystematized.andP;  There will probably be an evolution from one or a few expertsat early stages of development, to many experts once the system is in ongoingproduction use.andP;  For the configuration systems, there are literally hundredsof different experts in Manufacturing and Engineering which must be consultedfor information during each quarterly release cycle.andP;  (A truly criticallesson we learned early on was that having only one expert initially can bepotentially disastrous by falsely constraining the design and/or skewing theperspective which the system reflects.)andM;For USERS, the relative emphasis will shift from software functionality ncanthe expert system do the task?) to software quality (how accurate is thesystem?), and then from software quality to quality of delivery (howuser-friendly in the system?).andP;  Overall, the main evolutionary issue for theusers is how their business and their jobs change as a result of the use ofthe expert system.andM;As there are no norms, it took us a while to understand the skills andknowledge required in each role.andP;  We regularly assess the incumbents againstthese requirements to identify gaps and/or developmental needs.andM;Development Tasks and ProcessandM;As with the Key Roles Model, we have formulated a general model of expertsystems development, based largely on the configuration systems experience.andO;We believe there are four major expert systems development tasks.andP;  Withineach major task, there are a few key sub-tasks we emphasize to insurecontinued success, as follows:andM;Defining and redefining the systemandM;This includes determining how to exploit Expert Systems technology,determining where it is appropriate to use traditional software technology,and designing the system to satisfy a variety of requirements.andM;Extending and refining the systemandM;This includes knowledge base management, ongoing knowledge acquisition,integration of multiple systems, and user and system interface management.andM;Delivering the systemandM;This includes release management, release distribution, support of productioninstallations, and support of users.andM;Evaluating the systemandM;This includes looking at system accuracy, system performance, maintainabilitycharacteristics, and how well the system fits with the business need.andM;It has been our experience that these taks, per se, are similar to those usedin traditional software development.andP;  What is somewhat unique for expertsystems is the process which must be set up to achieve these tasks.andP;  We havelearned that the process of developing expert systems is likely to be evenmore iterative than traditional development for the following reasons:andM;* The technology is evolving.andM;* The problem is likely not well understood and of a knowledge-intensivenature,andM;* The match between technology and problem may be uncertain, andandM;* The business being affected will likely change significantly as a result ofthe use of the expert system.andM;The success of configuration systems at Digital would not have occurred hadwe not worked out a development process which allowed for iteration among allthe tasks and which set expectations of all participants appropriately.andM;For the ongoing development of our production systems, we have used a processwith basic ingredients: work planning and prioritization, softwaredesign/development/test, system quality review, and system release.andP;  We use aslightly different process for a new system's initial stages of development(pre-version 1).andP;  We have learned that the transition into production use isa real change, and our processes reflect that.andM;The development environment must support the overall development process andmake the developers' lives as easy as possible.andP;  This is where thespecialized expert systems languages and tools come into play.andP;  In CSDG, thefollowing real-time, iterative daily knowledge engineer activities aresupported: rule additions and modifications, database additions andmodifications, rule and database compilations, testing, and selective savingof rules and data.andP;  In addition, there is a global nightly build which mergesall validated rules and data, incorporates new database attributes, runsglobal tests, provides a &quot;clean,&quot; stable version of the system to developerseach morning, and generates run-time efficiency improvements.andM;CONCLUSIONandM;For Digital, the configuration systems experience has provided a model ofboth how much impact expert systems can have on a company, and how tosuccessfully manage the ongoing development of expert systems in productionuse.andM;The value of the configuration systems to Digital can be stated as follows:andM;* Explicit focus on a task, and the related information, that has previouslybeen distributed ineffectively among a variety of organizations.andM;The configuration systems have provided a focus on system configurationacross engineering groups, between manufacturing and engineering, between thefield and manufacturing, and across geographies.andM;* Support for the corporation's a la carte marketing strategy.andM;The configuration systems allow Digital to maintain its competitive edgeduring a time when our products and the solutions we sell are becomingincreasingly complex.andM;* Process efficiencies, change enablement, and evolution to tomorrow'sprocesses.andM;The configuration systems are providing these kinds of benefits to the designand selection of systems to be ordered, the technical validation of systemorders, and the fulfillment/build/installation processes for system orders.andM;* Testbed for application of expert systems technology and evolution ofrelated software engineereing languages, tools, and techniques.andM;The configuration systems effort spans the full spectrum of software lifecycles from research through production use.andP;  The configuration systems are afamily of multiple cooperating expert systems with a common knowledge base.andO;They utilize an architecture which integrates traditional and expert systemtechnology.andP;  CSDG provides significant input to the development of the VAXOPS5 language and related tools.andP;  The configuration systems effort is a primeexample of &quot;programming in the large.&quot;andP;  CSDG is dealing with very high ratesof change in the knowledge base/subject domain, the business environment, andthe expert system technology used.andM;We have set up a highly successful enterprise providing reliable, regularreleases of several extremely large expert systems which address a strategicbusiness problem and are used every day in the corporation worldwide.andP;  Theuse of these systems, by a variety of user groups, is saving Digital tens ofmillions of dollars each year and helping us come up the learning curve in anexciting technology.andM;As the development process must reflect and facilitate achievement of thedevelopment tasks, the development group organizational structure mustreflect and facilitate the processes used.andP;  We believe that there is no oneorganizational structure which will suffice for all time; CSDG has in factchanged its organizational structure a number of times over the years whenthe need has been apparent.andM;The CSDG currently has 59 members (excluding business management andadministrative support) and is organized in the following functionalsubgroups:andM;KNOWLEDGED ENGINEEERING--NEW SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT designs and develops the ALaspects of new expert systems.andP;  This includes developing the overall design,acquiring knowledge from experts, producing user scripts to bound the system,iterative prototyping, implementation development na transition phase) andreleasing initial version into production use.andP;  There are six people in thisgroup (10 percent).andM;KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING--OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT performs the knowledgeengineering aspects of the extension and refinement of the systems inproduction use.andP;  This includes acquiring knowledge from experts, representingthe knowledge, building the knowledge base, testing the systems, andproviding regular releases.andP;  There are 27 people in this group (45 percent).andM;QUALITY ASSURANCE provides support for the production systems which includesprocessing and analyzing user problems, conducting production environmenttesting, developing and monitoring performance and success metrics,performing documentation administration, and updating and maintaining aproject administration system.andP;

 There are four people in this group (7percent).andO;</TEXT></DOC>
