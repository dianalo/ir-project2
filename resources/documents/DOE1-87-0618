Itis shown that, although institutional uncertainties vary between nationalpolitical cultures, regulatory bureaucracies everywhere understate thesemore fundamental uncertainties (which are often structural conflicts,of different rationalities) and define them instead as marginal technicaluncertainties or imprecision in risk-definitions. Close comparative analysisshows that technical regulatory standards depend upon their local institutionalsetting in systematic ways, so that conventional regulatory emphasison technical precision or standardisation should be replaced by greatersocial negotiation, and educated public involvement and control.</TEXT></DOC>
