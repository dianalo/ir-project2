Bush suggested Americans would wakeup to a gloomy morning if Dukakis should be elected.   Bush celebrated like the front-runner he is Thursday night at aparty at Bob Hope's house. But Dukakis also was upbeat at a rallyearly today at a Baptist church in Kansas City, Mo..   ``In politics, as you all know, 11 days is an eternity,'' Dukakissaid. ``There is time to do it.''   He was introduced by the Rev. Wallace S. Hartsfield, who saidthat during the Reagan administration there have been ``a few at thehead of the table who refuse to pass the bread.''   Dukakis, who opened his remarks by saying ``I've got a littlepreaching to do,'' promised Hartsfield things would change in aDukakis White House.   ``We're not only going to pass the bread, but you're going to beat the table,'' he told the predominantly black audience.   Dukakis, who hosted a town meeting Thursday night in nearbyIndependence, Harry Truman's hometown, said he was inspired by thevisit and confident he could, like Truman, pull off an upset.   To win he will have to defy the polls much as Truman did in 1948.The newest batch of surveys _ including one Thursday showing anine-point Bush lead _ range from eight to 15 points.   Bush said Thursday night that he would not be ``talking on thenegative side'' in the closing days of the race, but that didn'tseem to last long.   He told a business group in Los Angeles today that Dukakis``wants to torpedo the prosperity we've worked so hard to achieve.''   Bush said, ``Peace means you can sleep at night knowing the worldwill still be there in the morning; prosperity means you can sleepat night knowing that opportunity will still be there in the morning.   ``You know about our mornings,'' Bush said. ``But I ask you toconsider: What kind of morning would electing the liberal governorof Massachusetts bring? Will it be gloomy? Will the dark clouds ofpessimism and limited possibility obscure our vision?'   Thursday night, at a stop in Kansas City, Dukakis sat for a14-minute interview with Dan Rather on the CBS ``Evening News''where he conceded that GOP advertising had hurt his candidacy.   ``There's no mystery about why they put those ads on. They havedone damage. There's no question about that,'' he said.   Dukakis suggested that Bush resorted to the commercials ``todivert public attention from the fact that this administration hasprobably had more corruption and malfeasance than any in recentmemory, if not in history.''   The Democratic nominee was continuing his campaign in Missouritoday before heading to Michigan and later Boston. Dukakis' runningmate, Lloyd Bentsen, was focusing on California _ and its electoralprize of 47 votes _ before returning to his home state of Texas.   Bush was also targeting California before traveling to Nebraskawhere he planned a joint appearance with Sen. David Karnes. TheRepublican candidate faces an uphill battle with former NebraskaGov. Bob Kerrey for the Senate seat.   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle was touring the``Pennsylvania Dutch'' region and scheduled a series of appearancesat the state's high schools.   The Republican ticket, according to an NBC News-Wall StreetJournal poll released Thursday, leads Dukakis-Bentsen 51 percent to42 percent, considerably closer than the 17 points in a similar polldone just after the Oct. 13 debate.   The survey, conducted among 1,285 likely voters, had a margin oferror of plus or minus three percentage points.   As he campaigned in the West, Bush said the Pacific nationsrepresent ``huge and growing markets'' for American goods, ``if wedon't turn and run away.''   ``I will make sure that our trading partners continue tounderstand that our markets are vital to their growth as well,''Bush said. ``Free trade must be fair trade. A Bush administrationwill keep the heat on.''   But Bentsen, in a speech to the World Affairs Council in LosAngeles, said that under the leadership of the Reaganadministration, the United States had become an internationaldebtor, dependent on foreign investors as it battles huge trade andbudget deficits.   ``The United States must be able to compete not only militarilybut economically,'' Bentsen said.   Dukakis, in the CBS interview, reiterated his populist view thatthe Democratic ticket favors average Americans while Bush is thecandidate of the privileged class.   ``I want the government of this country to be on the side ofaverage Americans and I think that's a fundamental differencebetween me and George Bush,'' the Democratic nominee said.   Meanwhile, the Dukakis campaign announced that it is doubling itsbudget for Hispanic ads, targeting seven states with large Hispanicvoter populations.   The campaign also is spending about $3 million _ 10 percent ofits media budget _ on black-oriented television and radio ads whichbegan three weeks ago.   In five of the radio ads, former Democratic candidate JesseJackson tells listeners, ``We have the power to make Mike Dukakispresident. Let's use it.''</TEXT></DOC>
