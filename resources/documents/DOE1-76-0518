Rapid growthis expected to resume or continue as the region's economies recover fromthe recession and as the rate of household electrification increases.Large hydroelectric projects have recently been completed in most ofthe countries. Although overcapacity exists in some countries, most ofthe national utilities expect to require new capacity within the nextfive years or earlier. All countries of the region are developing orexploring their geothermal resources. The cost of electricity generatedfrom geothermal energy compares favorably with the cost of the alternativesin Central America. Geothermal energy also has other advantages overthe alternatives, which may increase the role played by geothermal energydevelopment by the year 2000. By 2000, at least 10 percent of CentralAmerica's electric generating capacity is expected to be geothermal.</TEXT></DOC>
