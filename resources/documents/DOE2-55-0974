<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-55-0974 </DOCNO><TEXT>The anti pp -andgt; anti {Lambda}{Lambda} observables are calculated usinganti pp initial-state and anti {Lambda}{Lambda} final-state interactionsbased on the Paris anti NN potential, with the addition of a term simulatingthe 2K-exchange in the annihilation potential for the anti {Lambda}{Lambda}case. A satisfactory fit of the existing data is obtained. When the resultsare compared with earlier calculations, quantitative differences arefound for all observables showing the importance of the initial- andfinal-state interaction effects.</TEXT></DOC>
