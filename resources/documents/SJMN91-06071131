Hisportrait was stabbed or slashed 16 times while it hung in the county's LawLibrary, his eyes punched out, a hole in his left arm, another in his rightleg, a couple of punctures to his chest.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  RESTORATION PRESERVES PORTRAIT OF S.J. LEGALPIONEER  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  OUT of the PAST  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;It's almost like somebody got started, and they couldn't leave it alone,&quot;said Kathleen Muller, an administrator at the San Jose Historical Museum, whobelieves there was more than one vandal.;    And so it hung from the mid-1960suntil one day in 1989, when Susie Wilson, then a Santa Clara County supervisorand a law library trustee, spotted it.;    &quot;It was disgraceful,&quot; Wilsonrecalled. &quot;I said, 'That portrait has to come down.' &quot;;    But Moore was anintegral part of the early life of San Jose, and Judge John Herlihy, a memberof the boards of the museum association and the law library, thought theportrait should be saved if it could be restored.;    Enter the historicalmuseum and Jane Wood, who specializes in restoring paintings. Yes, she said,the damage could be repaired. Yes, said the association's board, we will payto have it done.;    Wood is an artist and Campbell-based conservator ofpaintings. Much of her conservation work involves cleaning or strengtheningthe canvas of old paintings, so the Moore portrait was a bigger challenge thannormal.;    &quot;That was more dramatic damage than most,&quot; she said.;    Inaddition to the obvious vandalism, the painting was dirty, water-damaged,varnish-stained and bulging where it had been leaned against a chair.;    Themeticulous restoration, concluded last year, took about 60 hours and cost$1,500.;    The painting was part of a collection of portraits of pioneermembers of San Jose's legal community amassed by the late Judge William F.James. Other works from James' collection adorn the walls of the law library,and some hang in courtrooms, said retired Superior Court Judge Mark Thomas.;   Moore's involvement in the early days of San Jose began before the city waseven incorporated. He was appointed city clerk in January 1850 but gave up thepost that spring to run for county attorney, a position later renamed districtattorney. Moore won that election and was re-elected for three subsequentyears.;    He later became city treasurer, a judge, a member of the stateAssembly, an incorporator of the San Jose and Santa Clara Railroad, andpresident of the old San Jose Savings Bank. He also had a private legalpractice.;    For many years, Moore lived in a 19-room Victorian mansion onThe Alameda near Schiele Avenue. The home, demolished in 1955, was said insome accounts to be &quot;almost a replica of the governor's mansion inSacramento.&quot;;    His portrait, which once hung in that house, now adorns awall at the Pacific Hotel on the museum grounds. It is one of more than 100framed works of historical significance that have been donated to the museum.;   When a planned replica of California's first statehouse is completed on themuseum grounds, the painting likely will be moved there as a reminder ofMoore's contributions to San Jose and the state.;    Despite his severe lookin his portrait, Moore was remembered upon his death in 1909 as an&quot;approachable, lovable man&quot; who unfailingly helped young men who wanted tostudy law with his firm.;    He had &quot;an extraordinarily keen sense ofjustice,&quot; according to his obituary in the Mercury.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOANNE GRANT, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910311  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  626  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday March 11, 199100071131,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
