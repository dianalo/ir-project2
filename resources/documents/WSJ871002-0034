The organizational changes are consistent with other moves in recent years by the computers and scientific-instruments giant to centralize its computer operations. The changes also will improve the ability of those operations to react quickly to changing market conditions.    Hewlett-Packard long has been known for allowing its far-flung products divisions almost complete autonomy -- a management structure that worked well in the engineering-intensive instruments business but that company executives have said is too scattered for the more market-driven computer industry.    Within the Technical Systems sector, Hewlett-Packard's division that makes and markets engineering and manufacturing computers, the company restructured its former engineering and manufacturing systems groups into two new groups. One is responsible for hardware and the other for software. The company said the reorganized groups &quot;will enable product-development and marketing activities aimed at the engineering and manufacturing markets to be more closely coupled.&quot;    Within its Systems Technology sector, Hewlett-Packard said it added a planning group, &quot;to provide coordination and direction of manufacturing and planning activities.&quot; The Systems Technology sector makes and markets peripheral devices like laser printers, as well as internally consumed components, such as microchips.    This new group &quot;ensures that HP can react to market changes as quickly as anyone and can count on continued excellence in manufacturing as a key to competitive advantage,&quot; said Dean O. Morton, executive vice president and chief operating officer.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the company's shares jumped $2 to close yesterday at $72.50. </TEXT></DOC>
