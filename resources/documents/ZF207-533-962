Surely there must be ways.andP;  The information could be split intotwo machines, with only one of the machines connected to the telephonenetwork.andP;  The transfer of information between the two should be under theabsolute control of the isolated machine.andM;Alternatively, the machine could ring back to an enquirer before allowing anyaccess, doing so only Hre telephone number matched one held in a fist storedon a seperate system and, at least, only capable of being changed from withinthe system.andM;As a non-expert, these simple ideas suggest to me that it is possible toprotect systems from outside interference, Some of the cases we've heardabout have been totally unnecessary.andP;  Many institutions keep quiet aboutsuccessful hacks out of embarassment; and so they should be embarassed.andM;A similar point applies to data security on a smaller scale.andP;  Remember floppydisks? Anything that is really sensitive can be kept on floppy disks andlocked in a cupboard or taken home.andP;  Old data files which are no longer anyuse, but still sensitive, can be turned into hard copy and then erased, Inlarger systems, sensitive material can be placed on removable fixed disks ortapes, and then removed from the system until a genuine, and authorized, needarises.andM;Again, this all sounds very simple, but we're dealing with a technology thatfundamentally makes access to information easier.andP;  Rigid control of wherethat data is stored and impenetrable physical barriers are the only ways tosafeguard it.andP;  When that data belongs to me, it's my responsibility; whenit's held by some major institution, then it has the responsibility.andO;Enforcing this element of responsibility is perhaps the only way laws couldwork.andM;However, there's no way that laws will kill off people's natural curiosity,tenacity or downright evil intent.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
