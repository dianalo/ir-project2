The spillover from federal tax-law changes and some state tax revisions have combined to increase the share of state income taxes paid by the affluent. Among other things, some high-income taxpayers have been dismayed to find that state levies on long-term capital gains generally rose by a greater percentage than the federal tax on those gains.    Nationwide, a mix of cuts and increases is producing a slight rise in the total state income taxes due on 1987 individual returns, says Steven D. Gold, state-tax specialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver. But he adds, &quot;On average, high-income returns will have increases, while low-income returns will have decreases. . . . I would think that the average return with income over $100,000 would have a 10% or more increase.&quot;    The impact of the state tax changes can vary widely at different income levels. For instance, in California, which passed a major tax overhaul last fall, officials estimate that a family of three with $100,000 of income and usual itemized deductions will see their state tax bill rise 18%, to $5,832 from $4,944. In contrast, the state tax bill for a family of four with $35,000 of income and usual itemized deductions will fall 18%, to $471 from $571.    Even in states such as New York that adopted tax cuts, some high-income residents will be disappointed. Douglas J. Green, state-tax specialist with accountant Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co., says some highincome New Yorkers &quot;come in and say, 'My tax bill is going to go down.' But that's just not true.&quot; As New York taxable income for 1987 climbs toward $100,000, Mr. Green says, &quot;calculations are going to show there will be little or no savings -- and maybe an increase.&quot;    The main reason that state taxes have increased for many affluent individuals is that more than 30 states &quot;piggyback&quot; on the federal government's definition of taxable income. Federal changes -- including restrictions on tax-shelter write-offs, limitations on interest deductions, and the end of the partial exclusion for long-term capital gains -- are substantially increasing some people's taxable income for state as well as federal purposes.    A number of states also followed the federal lead in cutting tax rates. But, unlike the federal government, the states generally didn't provide larger rate cuts for high-income people, who are most affected by the measures that increased taxable income. Instead, many states that faced a potential windfall from the broadened definition of taxable income targeted relief measures toward low-income families, by raising the standard deduction, for instance.    In a few states, high earners are finding that even though they now face a lower top rate in state taxes, they've lost a valuable tax benefit: the itemized deduction on state returns for federal taxes paid. Colorado, Minnesota and Utah eliminated that deduction altogether. And Oregon cut it to a maximum $3,000, from $7,000. &quot;We may have some people complaining about that,&quot; says James Scherzinger, Oregon's legislative revenue officer.    Meanwhile, some high-income taxpayers have been dismayed to see steep increases in state tax rates on capital gains. These occurred as most states followed the federal government's lead in eliminating the 60% exclusion from tax for long-term gains. Even in some states that cut their overall tax rates, the effective state levy on capital gains more than doubled.    In Minnesota, for example, the top rate on capital gains used to be just under 4%: 40% of the top tax rate of 9.9%. This year, capital gains will be subject to the new maximum rate on ordinary income of 9%, which will drop to 8% in 1988.    For affluent individuals, the percentage increase in the federal capital-gains tax is smaller than the increase in the state tax. That's because the top federal tax rate was cut more sharply -- to 33% in 1988 from 50% in 1986 -- and because federal capital-gains taxes are capped at 28% for 1987 as the new rates are phased in.    Mr. Gold says six states -- Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland and Wisconsin -- didn't follow the federal example and instead retained preferential treatment for capital gains.    As at the federal level, changes in state tax rules have engendered much confusion. In New York, state tax officials say calls from consumers are already running at a heavy, April-like pace. Many upper-income filers, for instance, are complaining that they haven't received the much-hated maximum-tax form. And they won't receive it -- the form was eliminated under New York's 1987 tax act.    There's confusion even in the many states that moved to simplify their tax codes by making them closer to the federal model. That simplification actually has made it more difficult to file 1987 returns, says Mr. Green of Peat Marwick Main, because &quot;you can't follow what you did the past year.&quot; Pat Hamel, a senior manager with accountant Price Waterhouse in New York, concurs: &quot;For state taxes, as with the federal, this tax filing season is going to be a nightmare for many people.&quot;    A final, discouraging word on state taxes comes from Julian Block, a tax specialist with Prentice-Hall Information Services in Paramus, N.J.: Although state income taxes continue to be deductible on federal returns, the lower federal tax rates make that deduction less valuable. So, he says, &quot;the after-tax cost to a person of his or her state income taxes is going to be higher.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
