However, long separators are required and thevertical angular acceptance is small. In this paper it is proposed touse as an alternative system of three rf separators. The beam withinthe separators is parallel in the vertical plane. In this way an orderof magnitude better separation is possible than with the dc separationtechnique. Furthermore, the solid angle acceptance of 6 GeV/c is a factor2.5 better.</TEXT></DOC>
