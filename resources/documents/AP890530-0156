The monthlong conference is to review human rights progressamong the 35 nations that are signatories of the 1975 HelsinkiFinal Act.   It also is expected to single out nations accused of specificabuses, and Romania and Bulgaria are expected to take the brunt ofcriticism.   About 20 foreign ministers attended the opening of the monthlongconference, the first of three mandated by the Vienna reviewcommittee of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,which ended in January.   In one of the first speeches, Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov ofBulgaria accused ``foreign circles'' of being behind recentdisturbances in his country in which ethnic Turks reportedly havebeen killed.   The Bulgarian delegation made available the text of a speech byPresident Todor Zhivkov that said ``certain circles in the Republicof Turkey'' have launched a ``continuously escalatinganti-Bulgarian campaign.''   ``This policy represents a gross interference in the internalaffairs of a sovereign state,'' the statement said.   The Bulgarian president, whose speech was broadcast on Monday,urged Turkey to open its border to all ``Bulgarian Moslems'' whowant to go there.   Bulgaria has been deporting ethnic Turks it considersundesirable. An estimated 300 have been forced to leave, most toAustria and Yugoslavia. Many also have been picked up by Turkishairliners for resettlement in Turkey.   According to an official report, three people died in recentethnic unrest. Deportees have put the figure at up to 30. Thereports could not be confirmed independently.   Mladenov said Bulgaria wanted to discuss the problems with``realism and good will.''   The second human rights conference is to be held in Copenhagenin 1990 and a third in Moscow in 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
