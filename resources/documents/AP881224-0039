The U.S.-based Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Andersonurged the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem Islamic Jihad to free thejournalist and Sutherland ``in the name of humanity.''   ``As Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland face their fourthChristmas and New Year holidays as hostages, we, their friends andcolleagues, ask you once again in the name of humanity to set themand others you are holding free,'' the committee said in a 20-lineletter.   An Arabic translation was published by five of Lebanon's 14 dailypapers.   The independent An-Nahar and conservative Ad-Diyar also publishedthe original English text in the apparent hope Anderson andSutherland would be allowed to read it. The two men did not knowArabic when they were kidnapped.   Anderson, 41, of Lorain, Ohio, the chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, is the longest-held of the15 foreign hostages. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Sutherland, 56, of Fort Collins, Colo., was acting dean ofagriculture at the American University of Beirut when he wasabducted June 9, 1985.   The letter noted that on July 24, Lebanon's most prestigiousShiite religious leader, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,``acknowledged the human suffering of the foreign hostages inLebanon and said that the time has come for a happy ending to theirplight.''   ``At this special time of year, we ask that you consider SheikFadlallah's words and bring an end to this tragedy for the foreignhostages and their families,'' it said.   Fadlallah is the reputed mentor of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,or Party of God, believed to be the umbrella for Islamic Jihad andother factions holding hostages.   Fadlallah on Friday reiterated his call for the release of thehostages on condition that Iranian, Palestinian and Lebanesecaptives held by Lebanese Christians, the Israelis and their allieswere also freed.   ``There should be no distinction among kidnap victims,''Fadlallah said at a sermon in southern Beirut.   ``Let the cry be for the release of all hostages with nodiscrimination. Let's treat the case from its humanitarian angle.Let us preserve the humanity of all the captives.''   Three Iranians and their Shiite driver were seized by militiamenof the right-wing Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia,when they drove across the Christian enclave north of Beirut duringthe 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.   All are believed dead.   Israel and its militia allies of the South Lebanon Army holdhundreds of Palestinian and Lebanese Shiites.   The journalists' committee called on the kidnappers to ``pleaserelay to Terry and Tom and others that they are not forgotten.   ``Their friends and families pray for them every day and thereare many people who work every day for the time when they are freeand return to the light and the love of their families.''   It said that the kidnappers' ``serious consideration of thisrequest is appreciated by many. We hope that the new year bringspeace to all the peoples of Lebanon.''   Beirut's leftist As-Safir daily published letters in English toMcCarthy, a producer for the London-based Worldwide Television News.They were paid for by his parents and friends.   McCarthy, 32, of Barnet, north London, was kidnapped April 17,1986.   A three-line message signed by his parents said: ``All our loveJohn. Happy Christmas and we're sure we'll see you soon.''   McCarthy's fiancee, Jill Morell, wrote: ``Darling John, we arespending another Christmas wishing you were here with us.   ``Don't despair. Try to keep your spirits up and be sure you'llbe home with us soon.''   A friend of McCarthy's, identified only as Sean, wrote: ``You arein our thoughts and prayers.''</TEXT></DOC>
