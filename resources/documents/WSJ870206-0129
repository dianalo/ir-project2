After sidestepping the issue for years, the White House is trying to resolve interagency disputes over whether to liberalize export controls. This effort, a setback for hardliners in the Pentagon, coincides with Mr. Reagan's call for more export competitiveness.    The administration plans to propose legislation that will shorten the time it takes to lift controls on exports of U.S. products when foreign equivalents are freely available from other countries. Makers of personal computers could benefit from this change.    The legislation also could seek authority to grant U.S. companies the right to ship large volumes of products to China under a single license. Currently, U.S. traders must obtain licenses for each product destined for China.    In addition, President Reagan's National Security Council is supervising a study of ways to streamline the mechanics of obtaining export licenses.    As a result of these initiatives, U.S. industry is anticipating some relief from export restrictions designed to protect sensitive American technology. &quot;Just read Reagan's competitiveness program,&quot; urges Eric Hirschhorn, a spokesman for the Industry Coalition on Technology Transfer, a high-tech lobbying group. &quot;What it says about export controls practically echoes our own platform.&quot;    The new effort to decontrol technologies whose export offers no serious threat to U.S. security and to reduce unilateral controls of U.S. products reflects the thinking of a new White House team managing the issue -- National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci and Ambassador Robert Dean, who is moving to the NSC from the State Department, where he deals with strategic technology policy.    Neither is known as a liberal. But they listen to high-tech producers such as David Packard, a founder of Hewlett-Packard Co., and retired Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who know the economic penalties of excessive controls.    The NSC is supervising a study that is expected to recommend trade-assisting reforms such as reducing licensing paper work and quicker interagency decisions on precedent-setting cases.    Until now the Reagan administration hasn't initiated legislation to ease export controls. One reason is that the Commerce Department and the Pentagon have been at odds over export-control policy. Richard Perle, assistant secretary of defense for international security policy, has resisted industry demands for easing restrictions.    But the new focus on competitiveness and a recent National Academy of Sciences report urging more balanced export controls have increased support for more liberal export controls.    Mr. Perle is fighting the tendency to slide back to the laxity of the pre-Reagan years. &quot;Sweeping aside controls in a frenzy could cause grievous harm to our security and our economy,&quot; he warns. But Mr. Perle no longer dominates policy-making as he did when White House direction was missing.    The presidential review is likely to fine tune the current system rather than cause a swing back to pre-Reagan ease. &quot;I don't think this administration, after investing all these resources, will just stand on its head and pull back,&quot; Mr. Perle insists. &quot;We've sewn up the patient. Nobody wants to rip him up again.&quot;    The U.S. is trying to meet its allies' complaints halfway in a bargain being worked out through the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom. The Paris-based Cocom is the forum through which the U.S. maps collective actions with Japan and 15 North Atlantic Treaty Organization members.    At a high-level meeting late last month, the U.S. offered to shorten the list of products to be denied the Soviet bloc by all Cocom members if the Europeans and Japanese agreed to enforce their own export laws more vigorously and help the U.S. obtain the cooperation of neutral countries. The Cocom delegations will meet again in July to see if they have a deal.    To give the U.S. more diplomatic leverage, Mr. Perle is urging the White House to include in its legislative package import penalties on foreign companies that violate U.S. export-control rules. </TEXT></DOC>
