SullivanandM;The New York City Fire Department and the El Paso, Texas Police Departmentare two of the growing number of public agencies cracking down on crime bytracking large amounts of data with optical media and imaging technology.andM;The fire department uses rewritable-optical media on a Novell NetWare 286local area network to track sections of the city where false alarms and firesfrequently occur, according to Mike Ciferri, deputy director of the firedepartment's information and computer services bureaus.andM;The Data, Image, Sound, Communication, Unified Storage (DISCUS)rewritable-optical image-processing system, from Advanced GraphicApplications Inc. of New York, provides fire fighters with 650M bytes of dataper removable disk.andM;Statistical data on the city's fires and alarms, which is stored on amainframe computer, is typically downloaded quickly in 250M-byte chunks tothe rewritable-optical disks, according to Ciferri.andM;&quot;DISCUS makes this data readily available through the network and allows usto run profiles on false-alarm boxes and gather statistics on firefatalities,&quot; he said.andM;In the long run, this helps fire fighters develop fire-prevention codes andhunt down arsonists, Ciferri said.andM;Easy Data ManipulationandM;Information on the PC-based DISCUS system can also be easily manipulated, headded.andP;  Fire marshalls can profile fire-alarm boxes to examine trends such asthe time and location of alarms -- flexible searches that wouldn't becost-effective when done on the mainframe, according to Ciferri.andM;Eventually, the fire department plans to include street maps and buildingfloor plans in the DISCUS system to help track fire locations.andM;Another law-enforcement office using optical technology and imaging equipmentis the El Paso, Texas, Police Department.andM;Police now have immediate access to thousands of arrest records, witnessstatements and photographs on one on-line system based on the MultiuserArchival and Retrieval System (MARS) from Micro Dynamics Ltd. of SilverSpring, Md.andM;With the Macintosh-based MARS application, two 3.2-gigabyte Sony Corp. writeonce, read many (WORM) optical-disk drives on an AppleTalk network replacedthe department's ancient mechanical microfiche card fetcher, according to Lt.andO;James Chesshire, the department's commander of Identification and Records.andM;Chesshire estimates that the cost payback on the approximately $100,000system -- in terms of labor hours and productivity increases -- will beroughly 12 months.andM;The new optical system provides up-to-date data as opposed to the 5-month-oldmicrofiche records the department previously used.andP;  The timely informationallows the police to easily determine if criminals are previous offenders andwhether they are using false identification, according to Chesshire.andM;The archived reports are also accessible to police officers, court officials,insurance companies and the public, Chesshire said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
