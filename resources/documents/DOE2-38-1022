Method ofdetecting Doppler frequency shift of the signal, reflected from ionosphere,is applied for measuring parameters of wave disturbances. Analysis ofcoherence functions and phase spectra, calculated for WD records obtainedin measuring triangle, showed the difference of space-time propertiesof some spectral disturbance ranges. It was revealed that fluctuationspectrum of frequency Doppler shift was determined both by WD, concentratedin separate spectrum parts and by electron density fluctuations characterizedby stochastic nature. Position of spectrum parts corresponding to WDis random on the frequency axis and isn't preserved during rather longperiod of time.</TEXT></DOC>
