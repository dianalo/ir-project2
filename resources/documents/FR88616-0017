The reason for the proposeddisapproval was that North Carolina had failed to submit a demonstrationthat the new emission limits for these four plants would protect the NationalAmbient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter. A 30 day public comment period was provided to allow public comments onEPA's proposal. The comment period was extended two times at the requestof CPandamp;L, and ended finally on June 26, 1987. Comments were received from the North Carolina Division of EnvironmentalManagement (NCDEM), from CPandamp;L, and from the Conservation Council ofNorth Carolina. <ITAG tagnum="84">Response to Comments </ITAG>NCDEM <T3>Comment: </T3>EPA should postpone disapproval. The nonattainment problemsare due to sources other than the CPandamp;L plants, and NCDEM and CPandamp;Lare in the process of resolving the problems. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA has received no indication, other than this initialstatement, dated April 23, 1987, that the problems are being worked out.Informal communications with CPandamp;L indicate that the utility is notmaking progress in assisting the State in this endeavor. Therefore, EPAhas decided to finalize the disapproval. The State still has the opportunity,and the responsibility, to correct any violations of the National AmbientAir Quality Standards which it discovers. <T3>Comment: </T3>EPA should reconsider its proposal to disapprove theannual opacity standards, for the following reasons: 1. The annual opacity standards encourage good operation and maintenance.2. The annual opacity standards protect the annual NAAQS, and EPA impliedthis was unnecessary. 3. The annual opacity standards are as enforceable as any other standards.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA does not argue with the statement that the standardsencourage good operation and maintenance. Also, EPA did not mean to implythat the annual NAAQS did not need protection separately from the short-termNAAQS. EPA's position, as stated in the proposal, is that both the shortand long term NAAQS are protected by the short-term emission limits, andthat the annual opacity standards are so resource consuming as to be unenforceableby EPA. EPA has reconsidered its position on this issue, and has decidedto promulgate the disapproval as proposed. First, Appendix P of 40 CFRPart 51 sets forth minimum requirements for continuous emission monitoring.Among those requirements, paragraph 4.1 states, in part, that ``[t]he averagingperiod used for data reporting should be established by the State to correspondto the averaging period specified in the emission test method used to determinecompliance with an emission standard for the pollutant/source categoryin question.'' The proposed regulation 2D.0536 does not meet this requirement,since the emission test method is conducted over a period of several hours,while the opacity standard is a yearly average. Second, it is EPA policythat, in order for emission limitations to be federally enforceable fromthe practical standpoint, they must be short term and specific so as toenable the Agency to determine compliance at any time. In comparison toa Method Nine, six-minute average, or a 2D.0521 five- or twenty-minuteaggregate, the annual average is not short term. CPandamp;L <T3>Comment: </T3>CPandamp;L's record of compliance with air quality standardsis excellent. <T3>Response: </T3>CPandamp;L's support for this statement is based upontheir analysis of ambient air quality data near its plants which purportedlyshows no upward trends. EPA's approval of SIP revisions, however, mustbe based upon more than ambient monitoring, since the ability of a limitednumber of monitors to record violations of NAAQS is also limited. Further,the monitors record what has happened under the present regulations, andnot what may happen if those regulations are relaxed. Section 110 of theClean Air Act requires SIP's to protect against violations of the NAAQs.Therefore, any SIP must demonstrate that when sources are emitting at theallowable levels, the NAAQS are not violated. <T3>Comment: </T3>The SIP revision will result in no increase in actualemissions from the CPandamp;L plants in question. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA's position is that whether an increase in emissionswill actually occur is irrelevant. The SIP must prevent emissions increasesfrom occurring which would violate PSD increments or NAAQS. The State mustsubmit an analysis with each SIP revision which demonstrates that the PSDincrements and NAAQS will be protected by the new limits. No analysis hasbeen submitted which demonstrates protection of the NAAQS for the fourplants. CPandamp;L also asserts that no increase in allowable emissions would occur.CPandamp;L bases its argument on the fact that they had ``no reason to doubtthat North Carolina has submitted the proper paper'' for EPA to extenda previous 3 year federally approved variance which expired in June, 1982.While this may be true, it does not change the fact that North Carolinadid not, in fact, submit the necessary request to EPA to extend the variance.Therefore, the previous federally approved limits have been in effect since1982, and approval of 2D.0536 would be a relaxation of those limits. <T3>Comment: </T3>The EPA should have acted upon the SIP revision in 1983based on modelling results available at that time and should not have requiredadditional modelling as a condition to approval. <T3>Response: </T3>CPandamp;L's position is based on statements making thefollowing two points: 1. EPA is required to act on SIP submittals in 4 months. 2. Even if EPA did not approve the limits for all the plants, it shouldhave approved the limits for plants located in areas where the PSD baselineis not triggered. If EPA had taken final action on the submittal in 1983, that action couldonly have been to disapprove the regulation, since a PSD increment analysishad not been submitted. Therefore, taking final action would not have changedthe federally approved limits. As to the plants located in untriggeredareas, CPandamp;L has now been made aware that EPA's previous guidance onthis point was in error. Even for a plant located in an area where thebaseline date has not been triggered, an analysis is necessary for allneighboring areas, impacted by the relaxation, where the baseline has beentriggered. In addition, it must be pointed out that 2D.0536 is a singleregulation. In order to approve parts of it, EPA must receive a requestfrom the State to do so. No such request was received in 1983. This comment goes on to disagree with EPA's disallowance of the use of``significance levels'' to screen out geographic areas from further ambientimpact analyses in SIP revisions even though such a procedure is allowedin EPA-mandated permitting programs. The comment is supported by referenceto a SIP relaxation in Illinois for the Baldwin Power Plant where a PSDanalysis was not required because no major source or major modificationhad applied for a permit within the significant impact area (52 FR 9676).EPA's response is that use of a significant impact area to exclude sourcesfrom review is allowed for permitting but not for SIP revisions. The reasonfor this is that the EPA regulatory program recognizes a different levelof responsibility in these two types of sections for correcting existingproblems. In permitting, it is an industrial source which is applying forthe increased emissions. The source owner has little power to correct existingambient problems not caused by his sources. Thus, it would be unfair toprohibit construction of the source unless it contributed significantlyto the violation. The basic responsibility for correcting the existingviolation lies with the State, through the SIP process, and not with anew source owner. For a SIP relaxation, however, it is the State who is ``applying'' fora relaxation to the very tool (the SIP) which is required by the CleanAir Act to correct existing violations and prevent new ones. Thus, to allowany exacerbation of a NAAQS violation through a SIP relaxation would beto contravene the basic purpose of the SIP. As to the Baldwin SIP revision,although the wording of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice may be misleading, the regulatory requirementreferred to in the Baldwin action is not the use of a significant impactarea for limiting the extent of a modelling analysis. Rather, it is themethod for establishing the boundaries of a PSD baseline area, which isdefined as the EPA designated attainment or unclassifiable area in whicha baseline triggering source locates or has a significant impact. Thus,no PSD analysis is required for a SIP relaxation for a source located inan area which has not been significantly impacted by a PSD source (or isnot in the same area as the PSD source). Once the baseline date is establishedfor an area by a PSD source, however any SO<T2>2</T2> or particulate SIP relaxation must contain an increment analysis,and that analysis cannot make use of a significant impact area to limitthe extent of the review. In the case of the Baldwin plant, EPA has identifiedan area_within the impact area of the source_where the baseline date hasbeen established. EPA is reviewing the source's new allowable emissionsto determine whether PSD increment would be consumed. If so, an incrementanalysis will be required to demonstrate that the proposed relaxation willnot cause or contribute to a PSD increment violation for SO<T2>2</T2>. <T3>Comment: </T3>The SIP revision establishes no less restrictive emissionlimits than did the variance which EPA previously approved. Therefore,since no new information became available between 1980 and the presentwhich would change EPA's position, the SIP revision should be approved.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees with the basic facts of this comment. Theinconsistency arises from the fact that EPA should have required an incrementanalysis for the variance, but erred in not doing so. The reason EPA didnot require the analysis was because of the temporary life of this variance.Conservation Council <T3>Comment: </T3>All necessary steps should be taken to reduce particulateemissions from utility boilers, regardless of the NAAQS. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA's ability to reduce emissions is limited to itsauthority under the Clean Air Act. If a SIP relaxation complies with NAAQS,PSD increments, and other statutory and regulatory requirements, EPA isrequired by law to approve it.<T3>Comment: </T3>EPA should ensure that the State and CPandamp;L do notdelay in submitting the results of the modelling. <T3>Response: </T3>Because the modelling has not been submitted, EPA isdisapproving the regulation. <T3>Comment: </T3>EPA should approve the annual opacity limits becausethe State needs them and they encourage better maintenance and operation.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA's disapproval of these annual limits has no effecton North Carolina's ability to enforce its own regulations, which are stilleffective under State law. EPA's disapproval is based upon the inabilityof EPA to enforce the regulation if it became necessary. <T3>Comment: </T3>Modelling should not be restricted to certain state boundaries,PSD areas, etc. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees. Modelling is not so restricted in EPA-requiredanalyses, except that, for areas where the PSD baseline is not triggered,no increment is consumed by SIP relaxations, and thus no analysis is needed.With the disapproval of Regulation 2D.0536, the current federally approvedSIP limits for the four plants, under 2D.0503, continue to apply to theplants. A chart showing the limit for each boiler can be found in the noticeof proposed rulemaking. For opacity standards for the four plants, Regulation2D.0521 continues to apply. It must also be pointed out that EPA, on July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24634) changedthe indicator for the particulate matter NAAQS from total suspended particulatematter to particles with an aerodynamic diameter of less than or equalto a nominal ten micrometers (PM<T2>10</T2>), and changed the level, the averaging times and the methodsfor calculation and measurement of the standards. Any future resubmittalof 2D.0536 or any other particulate SIP revision must contain a demonstrationthat the PM<T2>10</T2> standard is protected, and need not contain a demonstrationthat the former TSP standard is protected. For PSD, however, the TSP incrementsremain in effect until some future date when EPA plans to replace themwith PM<T2>10</T2> increments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action </ITAG>EPA today disapproves Regulation 2D.0536 as it applies to the CPandamp;LAsheville, Lee, Sutton and Weatherspoon plants. The previous federallyapproved emission limits under 15 NCAC 2D.0503 will continue to apply tothose plants, and have applied since June 30, 1982 when an EPA-approvedvariance from those limits expired. Under Executive Order 12291, this action is not ``Major.'' It has beensubmitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by August 15, 1988. This action may not be challenged later inproceedings to enforce its requirements.
