RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to disturbthe current system for giving pay raises to members of Congress _ asystem that produced a $12,000 salary hike last year.   The justices rejected arguments that the process gives too muchpower to the president to determine salary levels. The court, alsowithout comment, declined to use the case to determine what powermembers of Congress have to challenge the constitutionality offederal laws.   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and five Republican House memberschallenged the pay-raise system after congressional salaries wereraised $12,000 last year to $89,500.   The pay-raise system, which was established by a 1967 law, alsocontrols salary increases for federal judges and high-rankingexecutive branch officials. But the challengers to the law did notattack those provisions.   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington upheld thepay-raise system last May 31, ruling it is constitutional because itallows Congress to override salary increases granted by thepresident. The Supreme Court left that ruling intact Monday.   In other action, the court:   _Heard arguments about the rights of unwed fathers whose childrenare put up for adoption by their mothers.   _Refused for now to let a Jewish organization display a menorah,symbolizing the Hanukkah holiday, on the steps of a Pittsburghgovernment building next month. The court is reviewing theconstitutionality of the display.   _Agreed to use a case involving a small Pennsylvania and Ohiorailroad to resolve an important railroad industry dispute affectingthe ability of railroads to sell off their lines and reduce theirwork forces.   _For the second time this month refused to grant husbands legalpower to prevent their wives from having an abortion. The courtrejected an appeal by a Michigan man who sought unsuccessfully lastsummer to stop his then-estranged wife from ending her pregnancy.   _Allowed prosecutors investigating labor union corruption in NewYork to use subpoenaed membership lists obtained from fourcarpenters union locals.   Prior to 1967, Congress had set its own salary scale. But thelawmakers, seeking to share responsibility for giving themselves payraises, passed the Federal Salary Act in 1967.   The act calls for a study commission to be convened every fouryears with members appointed by all three branches of government.The commission sumbits recommendations to the president, who in turnproposes a pay plan to Congress.   The president's recommendations become effective unless Congressacts within 30 days to disapprove them.   The law was amended in 1985 to require action by both houses tooverride the president's recommendations. The original law permittedeither house to veto a pay hike. But the so-called legislative vetowas declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1983.   In its ruling in May, the appeals court said the elimination ofthe legislative veto causes ``marginally increased practicaldifficulty'' for Congress to override a presidential recommendation.   But, the appeals court said, Congress still is ``afforded theopportunity explicitly to reject or modify any or all of thepresident's recommendations before they go into effect.''   The appeals court also rejected the challenge to the pay-hikestatute on grounds the federal courts should not rule in disputes inwhich Congress has the power to remedy the problem itself.   The appeals court also rejected an argument that delegating arole to the president in setting congressional salaries violates theconstitutional separation of powers among the three branches ofgovernment.   Challenging the law along with Humphrey were Reps. Robert Dornan,R-Calif.; Bob Smith, R-N.H.; Beau Boulter, R-Texas; Jack Davis,R-Ill.; and Clyde Holloway, R-La.   They were joined by consumer advocate Ralph Nader and theNational Taxpayers Union.   The Reagan administration urged the Supreme Court to uphold thepay-raise system.</TEXT></DOC>
