Boeing's plans for the 212-acre site have attractedintense local interest since the aerospace concern bought theproperty from a racetrack owner in September. Boeing said ithasn't decided whether this will be the last year for racingat Longacres.</LP><TEXT>   The complex would become Boeing's ninth &quot;major location&quot;in the Puget Sound area and eventually include 15 buildingswith three million square feet of office space, a Boeingspokesman said. The company, which currently occupies about44 million square feet of space locally, doesn't plan to moveits corporate headquarters into the complex.   Boeing's plans, which are subject to approval by localauthorities, could meet some resistance because of concernsabout more traffic and because the property includesenvironmentally sensitive wetlands. Boeing hopes to beginconstruction in January and occupy the first structure inJune 1993.</TEXT></DOC>
