Some are crying. Some are laughing so they won't cry.   Quake jokes have been big on the comedy circuit since the Oct.17 shaker, which measured 7.1 on the Richter scale. Now crane jokesare starting to make the rounds after the 16-story plunge of agiant crane last Tuesday that killed five people and injured 21.   It's hard to feel safe anywhere after a week when, in additionto the crane accident, a bus and train collided, killing two, and astreet caved in from a broken water main.   Oddball theories abound on the cause of the troubles.Astrologers claim the calamities were preordained, based on thecity's ``birth date'' of Jan. 30, 1847, when the pueblo of YerbaBuena became San Francisco.   ``San Francisco is moving into a period of bad luck anddisasters, being injured in our tenderest places, while being in aposition of negative publicity and changes in our image,'' saidastrologer Jayj Jacobs.   The string of bad breaks continued Friday when Mayor Art Agnoswas hit by a big wave and slammed into a beach in Hawaii. Agnos,who was on the island of Maui to speak about earthquakepreparedness and crisis management, broke his collarbone and willneed to wear a brace for two to three weeks, mayor's spokesmanScott Shafer said.   The mayor scoffs at suggestions the city is cursed, but worriesthat a disaster a day will keep tourists away.   The recent accidents, though spectacular, did not result in alarger number of deaths or injuries than occur daily in many bigcities. But San Francisco, for all its glamour and internationalpresence, is a relatively small place _ the population is aboutone-tenth that of New York _ and events are magnified.   Crisis hotlines are so busy callers often are put on hold.Mental health clinics are packed with stressed-out patients, someafraid to go into tall buildings, cross bridges or ridedouble-decker freeways.   Calls to the suicide prevention and related hotlines for peoplewith problems such as drugs or marriage troubles were up 30 percentin the first couple of weeks after the quake, reaching about 260 aday.   Though the number of calls has since eased off, the numbersdon't tell the whole story because callers in the past week havetended to be more upset on average and each takes longer to help,said Eve Meyer, executive director of San Francisco SuicidePrevention.   ``The calls we've been getting this week are more intense ...,''said Meyer. ``The events this week triggered memories of the quake.And the fact that this is happening during the start of the holidaystress season is adding to the anxiety. We've burned out a lot ofvolunteers in the last month.''   If comedy is tragedy plus time, as Alan Alda observes in WoodyAllen's latest film, ``Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' then SanFrancisco is getting funnier every day.   ``Humor is a defense mechanism,'' says comedian Mark Pitta.``When the quake first happened, there was nothing funny about it.There was no way I was going to make fun of the Bay Bridge or I-880collapse. But after a grace period, you could start telling jokes.Now so many things are happening it's ridiculous.''   Pitta suggests that ``the networks are going to keep crews outhere all the time just to wait for disasters.''   The thousands of people complaining of feeling more vulnerablethese days are experiencing a normal reaction, but they should seekhelp if the fear gets too intense or lasts more than a couple ofmonths, psychologists say.   ``Many people have had trouble sleeping or eating properly,''said Rosemary Martinez, a social worker and psychological clinicianat the Mission Crisis unit. ``But when they are unable to leavehome because it's the only place they feel safe, at that point theyreally need to be seen on an emergency basis.''   Recent immigrants, the homeless and people dealing with personaltragedies are more severely affected psychologically by thedisasters, said Dr. Allen Turpin, a psychiatrist who treats manySoviet immigrants.   ``It's been really traumatic for them, especially the older andmore recent immigrants,'' Turpin said. ``They still can't sleepwell. It seems everything is still shaking.''   ``Their lives are unsettled and this exacerbates what they'realready going through.''   One newcomer to the region has been closer to the disasters thanmost, but she's vowing to keep on.   Joyce Vincentz, a 25-year-old New Jersey native, was aboard acommuter train that plowed into a chartered bus Monday. The nextmorning, she arrived for work in the Financial District minutesafter the 240-ton crane fell onto a busy street.   After each accident, she called her mother in New Jersey toassure her she was OK.   ``After the earthquake, everybody in the East asked me if I waspacking my bags,'' she said. ``I said, `No, it will take more thanan earthquake.' And then I was on the train. So ... my mother askedif I was going to pack my bags. And I said, `No, it will take morethan that.'''</TEXT></DOC>
