For the first time in decades major protests involving tens ofthousands of citizens also broke out in other cities, according tostate-run Czechoslovak television. The demonstrations were peaceful.   The protesters met in central Wenceslas Square, then set outacross town for Hradcany Castle, the residence of President GustavHusak, in a noisy, triumphal procession for democracy.   ``It's the end, Milos!'' and ``Jakes out!'' the protesterscried, referring to Communist Party chief Milos Jakes. They alsocalled for free elections and loudly supported a general strikecalled by students and artists for Nov. 27.   The march was the fourth major protest in Prague in as many daysand indicated severe trouble for the Communist government, whichuntil recently faced only small demonstrations. Leaders haverejected reforms that have swept through neighboring Communistcountries in recent weeks.   Police did not stop the march, but they blocked bridges acrossthe Vltava river leading to the castle. Many demonstrators changedcourse and continued on to a major plaza, Old Town Square, chanting``We are the people.'' Later, they dispersed peacefully.   The small police presence today contrasted sharply with lastFriday, when security forces severely beat demonstrators, promptingwidespread outrage.   ``The bell tolls for you!'' the crowd chanted. Some carriedbanners reading, ``Democracy for all'' and ``Red murderers tocourt.''   The marchers jeered as they passed the offices of the Communisttrade union daily, Prace, crying ``Are you Czechs?''   ``Here it happened,'' they yelled, as they passed the site wherepolice beat demonstrators on Friday. Several candles marked thespot.   Trolley cars rang their bells as the protesters passed andbystanders jingled their keys, adding to the noise.   In an unusual move, the state-run news agency CTK reported thedemonstration quickly and in objective language. It noted theprotesters ``express strong disagreement at the action taken byriot police'' on Friday. Czech television reported 200,000 peoplealong the path of the march.   Also today, students began a sit-in strike at Pragueuniversities to protest police attacks on demonstrators, and aCommunist leader for the first time condemned the bloody crackdownFriday.   Banned playwright and prominent activist Vaclav Havel canceled atrip to Sweden, where he was due to accept the Olof Palme award, toprotest the violence. In Sweden, it was announced that ForeignMinister Sten Andersson will go to Prague to present the award toHavel.   East German Communist Party chief Egon Krenz postponed a visitto Prague that had been scheduled for Tuesday. And Britain summonedthe Czechoslovak ambassador to protest the police beatings of twoBritish journalists. It called the weekend violence ``disgracefuland gratuitous.''   In Washington today, State Department spokeswoman MargaretTutwiler said of the events Friday: ``By attacking peacefuldemonstrators, Czechoslovakian authorities further damaged theircredibility at home and abroad.''   In a statement, she urged the Czechoslovak government to ``endthis senseless violence against is own citizens.''   According to unofficial reports, student strike committees werenegotiating with university authorities at the Technical Universityin Prague and the downtown Film Faculty.   At least three official Prague theaters went on a de factostrike, refusing to put on shows and terminating cooperation withofficial media, actors told The Associated Press by telephone. Theyspoke on condition of anonymity.   A statement of the official Socialist Union of Youth calledFriday night's police crackdown on student demonstrators``politically irresponsible.''   The communique was endorsed by Vasil Mohorita, the union'schairman and Communist Party central committee secretary. It wasthe first time a Communist official publicly condemned such policeaction.   Many people were injured Friday in clashes with the police, whoused truncheons, tear gas and attack dogs to disperse the largestdemonstration in 20 years. Hospital officials said 100 peoplerequired treatment.   The march was to commemorate student Jan Opletal, killed by theNazis 50 years ago. It was the largest demonstration inCzechoslvakia since August 1969, when some 50,000 people gatheredin downtown Prague a year after a Soviet-led invasion crushed areform movement.   The socialist daily Svobodne Slovo joined in the condemnation ofthe official handling of the demonstration. The paper gave fullcoverage to the events, even quoting witnesses of bloody beatings.   ``Such police action only creates tension in society and causesnatural resistance, especially of those who are the future of ourcountry _ the youth,'' the daily said.   By contrast, the Communist Party daily Rude Pravo in aneditorial today called for ``resolute action against provocations.''   On Sunday, authorities arrested 10 dissidents, including PetrUhl, a leading human rights activist. He was charged in connectionwith the spreading of news about the purported death of amathematics student at police hands Friday. The government hascalled reports of the student's death ``an unfounded rumor.'' Ifconvicted, Uhl could be sentenced to 3{ years in prison.   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe:   _The Romanian Communist Party opened a party congress, andPresident Nicolae Ceausescu denounced the democratic reformssweeping much of the East bloc. Many Western ambassadors boycottedthe gathering to protest human rights violations.   _In East Germany, a Communist Party daily said some extremistsurged their countrymen to sabotage the nation's electrical systemas a form of protest. One Sunday, more than 100,000 peopledemonstrated in several cities to demand reforms.   _About 2,000 Bulgarians took part in another pro-democracyprotest Sunday, a day after the largest rally staged by dissidentsin the country's Communist history. They signed petitionscriticizing the Communist leadership.   At a news conference today, Havel said he would not travel toSweden to receive the Olof Palme award even if authorities issuehim a passport.   ``I will not make use of that passport, and I will not leave thecountry,'' Havel said.   ``I do not wish to serve as a false visiting card of this regimewhich wants to claim that a foremost dissident is traveling abroad... while people are brutally beaten in the streets,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
