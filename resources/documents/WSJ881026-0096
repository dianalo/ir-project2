On the white side of the election, the far-right Conservative Party is expecting to consolidate its rapid growth of the past two years by posting broad gains in rural farming towns and blue-collar working communities. Should they sweep to victory in towns across the Transvaal Province, the country's northernmost and most-populous region, the Conservatives will be in a strong position to challenge the ruling Nationalist Party for national power in the next parliamentary elections, which could come next year. Until then, they are certain to intensify the pressure against the government's halting moves toward social and political integration.    On the black side of the election, anti-apartheid groups have called for an election boycott in a continuing attempt to deny legitimacy to the local government structures in the black townships. If the boycott succeeds, anti-apartheid organizations, despite massive restrictions, will upset Pretoria's counter-revolutionary strategy, which is designed to win the hearts and minds of the country's black majority and to re-establish control in the townships.    Thus, for the first time in South Africa, it seems the government is more preoccupied with a black election than with a white one.    &quot;It's warfare,&quot; says Victor Milne, a regional director of the Transvaal Provincial Administration. &quot;They {the activists} can lose, because they will live to fight another day. We cannot lose.&quot;    Tension in the black townships has increased in the days leading up to the vote. Limpet mine blasts and car bomb explosions have occured almost daily for the past month, with the government blaming them on attempts by the outlawed African National Congress, or ANC, to disrupt the election. On the other hand, the Human Rights Commission, an anti-apartheid monitoring group, reports that 300 activists have been detained without charge since Sept. 1.    The government's counter-revolutionary strategy is based on this curious piece of apartheid arithmetic: 30 + 50 - 20 = 100. Security experts in the government estimate that 20% of South Africa's blacks are radicals bent on overthrowing white minority rule; 30% are moderates or conservatives who more or less support the government; and 50% are apathetic, liable to be swayed in either direction. The strategy is to neutralize the 20% through repressive state-of-emergency measures and woo the 50% with expensive upgrading projects in the townships, eventually adding them to the 30%. &quot;The more they get, the more they get involved,&quot; explains Roelf Meyer, the deputy minister of constitutional development and planning.    Today, the government will find out whether its equation adds up. The government, which spent over $2 million promoting the vote, is pinning the future of its constitutional fine-tuning on the success of the black elections. &quot;If local government doesn't work,&quot; says Mr. Milne, &quot;we have a major constitutional problem.&quot;    Because of the high stakes, the government is determined to claim a victory and will undoubtedly welcome any vote total. In fact, some government officials are already claiming a win, pointing out that 19.3% of the registered black voters in contested wards cast ballots during two weeks of &quot;prior voting&quot; specially designed to limit intimidation on election day. What this figure boils down to is 285,000 voters out of a total black population of more than 26 million.    But the true measure of the elections can only be taken several months from now, with the ultimate acceptance or rejection of local government by blacks. &quot;A political vote without the hearts and minds of the people doesn't mean anything,&quot; concedes Mr. Meyer.    The government's obsession with winning hearts and minds on the local level flows from its failure to entice black leaders into token participation at the national level. Pretoria has long talked of establishing a multiracial council where participants can design a constitutional system of power-sharing -- albeit one that stops short of majority rule. However, most black leaders have refused to participate in such a council at least until the ANC is unbanned and Nelson Mandela, the ANC's leader, is released from prison.    Thus, the government has been forced to adopt a &quot;bottom up&quot; approach, which begins with getting black leaders elected in their own communities and then advancing them to local multiracial bodies, then provincial councils and then, perhaps, national forums.    &quot;It's an evolutionary process,&quot; says Mr. Meyer. &quot;The local level can provide a foundation for building on other levels.&quot;    Or it can cause a collapse of the whole process. Critics of today's vote say that local government will never amount to much until the elections are truly democratic, which, they say, would mean the unbanning of all organizations and the release of all political prisoners. </TEXT></DOC>
