<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-27-0117 </DOCNO><TEXT>A closed-form solution for the determination of optical flow is presented.In addition to being closed-form, this approach does not require theoptical flow field to be spatially smooth. By assuming that the m-thorder time-derivative of the optical flow is zero, (m can be chosen aslarge as required depending on the desired accuracy), the relationshipsbetween optical flow and its derivatives in a sequence of frames to thoseat a particular frame of the sequence are obtained. These relations inconjunction with the brightness constraint equation are used to forma system of linear equations in which the unknowns are the componentsof optical flow which can be recovered by the inversion of a 2m x 2mmatrix. The entries of this matrix contain only the first order spatialand temporal brightness derivatives. An alternative solution to the problemis considered in which each component of the optical flow is modelledas a polynomial (in time) of degree m-1.</TEXT></DOC>
