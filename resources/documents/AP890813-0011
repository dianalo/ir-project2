In Jerusalem, the army's chief spokesman, Brig. Gen. EphraimLapid, refused to confirm or deny the report but said Israelconsiders its prisoners of war to be alive unless it hasdocumentary proof to the contrary.   ``By proof, we do not mean through the British media or othermedia, but through the Red Cross,'' he said.   The weekly, quoting unidentified senior sources in the Israeligovernment, said Sunday that intelligence officers interrogatingSheikh Abdul Karim Obeid have concluded the soldiers died fromwounds after being ambushed near Beit Yahoun in February 1986.   Israeli commandos captured Obeid, the reputed leader ofHezbollah, or Party of God, in southern Lebanon, in a daring raidinside the Lebanese border July 28. Israeli officials have saidthey were willing to exchange Obeid for three captured Israelisoldiers including the two cited in the Times story.   The newspaper also said the parents of the soldiers wereinformed by the military that their sons were dead, but bothfamilies told the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot that they receivedno such report. The family of one of the soldiers, Yosef Fink,refused to comment when contacted by The Associated Press.   The newspaper said Israel had long been aware that the soldiers,Fink and Rahamim Alsheik, were injured when they were captured Feb.17, 1986, but believed that at least one of the soldiers survived.   After questioning Obeid, the Israeli government believes one ofthe soldiers died 15 minutes after the ambush and the other diedhours later, the weekly said. Security officials said they believedlast week that neither Hezbollah nor Iran knew that Israel hadlearned its soldiers were dead, the weekly reported.   The newspaper said the third Israeli missing in Lebanon, airforce navigator Ron Arad whose fighter jet was shot down over Sidonin Oct. 16, 1986, is believed to be alive but is being held byLebanese militia with closer ties to Syria than Iran.   The weekly, quoting security sources in Jerusalem, said PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir has told his Cabinet not to publiclydiscuss the matter of the two ambushed soldiers and has tried tokeep it secret from the United States to offset U.S. pressure tofree Obeid in exchange for Western hostages in Lebanon.   ``Israeli leaders know that agreeing to such an American requestwould help mend the recent strains in Israeli-American ties; butthey fear that Obeid's release would prompt criticism at home thatIsrael risked the lives of its soldiers for an operation thatsolely benefited America,'' the newspaper said.</TEXT></DOC>
