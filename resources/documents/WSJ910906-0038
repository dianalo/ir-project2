Officials acknowledged that their cleanup plans may haveto be pared down because of budget constraints. But, by theagency's own estimates, too much cutting could leave thegovernment unable to meet its legal obligations to manageenvironmental problems at the nation's nuclear-weaponsfacilities.</LP><TEXT>   The government expects it will take at least 30 years toremedy contamination caused by 45 years of atomic weaponsresearch and production. The cost is expected to exceed $100billion.
