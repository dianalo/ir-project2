The solar hydrogen economy, in which hydrogenis used as energy medium, offers a way out of this situation. Large scaleconcepts are based on photovoltaic power stations in Africa and the electricitygenerated is used to produce hydrogen by electrolysis locally. The hydrogencan be transported to us by the existing natural gas network, which connectsall of Europe via Italy from Tunisia, crossing the Mediterranean. Theexisting infrastructure is compatible with the use of hydrogen. Comparedwith storing electricity in batteries (limited life), the problems ofstoring hydrogen are small. Long term storage can be achieved cheaplyby hydrogen technology. (HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
