Using a guinea pig model of asbestos administration that producesprimarily airway disease and associated airflow abnormalities, we showedpreviously that the combination of asbestos and smoke acts synergisticallyto produce more marked increases in tissue collagen, fibrosis of airwaywalls, and early interstitial fibrosis than are seen with asbestos alone.To investigate the functional effects of these morphological and biochemicalabnormalities, pulmonary function tests for volumes and flows, includinglung volumes, pressure-volume curves, and flow-volume curves, were performed.By themselves, both smoke and asbestos produced increases in total lungcapacity (TLC), residual volume (RV), and functional residual capacity(FRC); the two agents together made all these changes worse than eitherone alone. Both smoking and asbestos moved the pressure-volume curveupward, and the effects of the two agents together were again greaterthan either alone. Similarly, both smoke and asbestos decreased flows,and the two agents produced more severe impairment than either one byitself. The changes in volumes, pressure-volume curve, and flows correlatedwith both increased thickness of small airway walls and increases inairspace size. These observations indicate that, at least in this guineapig model, cigarette smoke can potentiate the functional consequencesof asbestos exposure.</TEXT></DOC>
