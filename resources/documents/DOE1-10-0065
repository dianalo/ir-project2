Once it is determined that there exists potential,the evaluation process seeks: identification and quantification of thetypes of mutations expected, extrapolation of laboratory results to humans,estimation of the expected total contribution to the human genetic load,and estimation of the impact on society of the mutational increase expected.In practice, evaluation of genetic risk is likely to be carried out ona case-by-case basis and with many risk-related questions left unanswered.In this context, the case of two environmental mutagens is discussedwith emphasis on mouse germ cell mutagenesis data. 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
