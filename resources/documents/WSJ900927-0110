That's like, you know, a totally awesomewave.   Surfspeak derives largely from Standard English and isvery closely related to Californian. In fact, it has become asort of classical language, by Malibu standards, dating allthe way back to the ancient 1960s, when the Beach Boys werereally boys and Ventures was a rock band instead of thingsthat capitalists finance. Surfspeak has occasionally baskedin national favor and seems to have inspired much of what isknown as Valley Girl talk, thus extending its influence overyoung people around the country.</LP><TEXT>   Now the language is beginning to receive scholarlyattention -- mainly from Trevor &quot;Coconut&quot; Cralle, 29 yearsold, who may be the world's leading authority on it. In thesix years since he graduated with a degree in culturalgeography from the University of California at Berkeley, Mr.Cralle has combed almost every known surfing spot on the WestCoast, Hawaii and Australia in search of the perfect wave andthe most esoteric slang.   Mr. Cralle, who works as a writer-researcher for theCalifornia Coastal Commission, has compiled his research intoa thick manuscript, &quot;The Surfin'ary: A Dictionary of SurfingTerms and Phrases,&quot; and is shopping it around to publishers.&quot;A lot of empirical research has gone into this,&quot; says Mr.Cralle, who abandons his easygoing surfer-dude manner andadopts an intense professorial tone when talking about hisbook.   Mr. Cralle has his own research methods. He goes surfingand interviews his subjects between catching waves. &quot;It's agood way to get their confidence.&quot; he says. &quot;They know I'mnot just some goob from the Valley&quot; -- that is, the sprawlingSan Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. He also hasscrupulously culled every new slang word he can find fromarticles in magazines, books and newspapers, and hasconducted interviews in surf shops.   The Surfin'ary is designed to preserve and document a richsubculture, Mr. Cralle says. But it may also have greatappeal for surfing wannabes or poser hodads or nons(non-surfers) who want to sound like surfers while avoidingsunburn and salt water and who have never tried to toe up ona stick (to surf). Even people who don't know the differencebetween a goofy foot (their left) and a natural (their right)can talk like thrashers (surfing showoffs).   Many of the Surfin'ary entries describe waves, women,surfboards and geeks (originally, carnival side-show freakswho bit the heads off live chickens) who can't surf. Thereare also terms for less glamorous aspects of the beach-partylife style. Vomiting, for example, is &quot;talking to the seals.&quot;   Some terms have a religious cast. A great ride can be like&quot;going to church&quot; or visiting &quot;in the Pope's living room.&quot; Agreat wave or an attractive woman can be &quot;just like death.&quot;   Mr. Cralle endeavors to catalog every usage, no matter howobscure. Gremmies (short for gremlins) are either &quot;traineesurf mongrels on their way to full surf Nazi status&quot; or&quot;selfish undesirable pest(s)&quot; who are constantly causingtrouble for other surfers.   Mr. Cralle defines hodad as &quot;a surfer who rarely goes intothe water but still talks, acts and dresses as if he were aminor god of the sport,&quot; or &quot;a greasy hot rodder with longhair and sideburns . . . an ill-mannered beach bum whodoesn't surf . . . generally anyone surfers don't like.&quot;   Some Malibu surfspeak seems to have seeped through TopangaCanyon to the San Fernando Valley to become Valley Girl talk,popularized in 1982 by rock musician Frank Zappa and hisdaughter, Moon Unit. &quot;The Vals thought words like `gnarly,'`rad' and `tubular' were cool, so they took them home,&quot; Mr.Cralle says. All three words are strongly approbativeadjectives.   The slang was exported to the rest of the world bytelevision, movies and records. Writers for the TV shows andmovies mostly live near the beach and they write down whatthey hear, says Albert Lewin, a screenwriter who co-authoredthe &quot;The Thesaurus of Slang&quot; with his wife, Esther.   Music groups such as Surf Punks and The Surf MCs also havespread the slang. Surf Punks, a Los Angeles band, includes aglossary with every album. The Surf MCs, from Berkeley,combines elements of rap and punk; the group's anthem is&quot;Surf or Die.&quot;   Some words and expressions have moved the other way, fromthe media into surfspeak. A male dweeb is often called a&quot;Fred&quot; or a &quot;Barney&quot; and a female dweeb is &quot;Wilma,&quot; after theFlintstone characters. The Flintstones also have givensurfing &quot;Yabbadabba doo]&quot; an exclamation of exhilaration akinto &quot;Cowabunga]&quot;   Surfspeak keeps changing as it loses expressions to ValleyGirl and other forms of slang. Language helps true surfers&quot;identify the geeks,&quot; says Rick &quot;Rocking Fig&quot; Fugnetti, whoproduces a surf report for a Los Angeles radio station. &quot;Butonce the Vals pick it up the lingo has to change.&quot;   Says Erin Martin, a 17-year-old resident of Newport Beach:&quot;These Val guys are totally gross. They think they're real,but you can tell they're Barneys.&quot; She says &quot;dweeby types&quot;often &quot;snog right up&quot; to her when she's wearing her &quot;floss,&quot;or thong-backed bikini.   Robert L. Chapman, a retired professor at Drew Universityand author of a dictionary of American slang, says that&quot;Southern California is the richest place for new slang,&quot;though much of it is ephemeral, lacking &quot;the staying power ofblack slang,&quot; for example. Surfspeak, says Prof. Chapman, islike a skyrocket. &quot;It goes up with a big noise, explodes in avery colorful way and then poof, it dies.&quot;   Yet a few terms, such as &quot;gremmie,&quot; and &quot;hodad&quot; -- havesurvived for more than a generation. &quot;Hang 10&quot; -- to curlone's toes over the end of a surfboard -- is still used, butnot by most surfers; the boards they ride today are too shortto permit the stunt without the surfer losing balance.   &quot;Cowabunga]&quot; is another old word. It began as the greetingthat Buffalo Bob and Chief Thunderthud exchanged in thepopular 1950s television program for children, &quot;Howdy Doody,&quot;and was picked up as an exclamation by surfers, says Mr.Cralle. It spread to the nation through the &quot;Gidget&quot; surfermovies and, later the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip. Now the TeenageMutant Ninja Turtles have adopted it as their war cry andenhanced its popularity.   But surfers still use it, too. &quot;Cowabunga -- it's a prettygood word. It's powerful and enduring,&quot; Mr. Cralle says.Certainly, he adds, &quot;it'll outlast the Teenage Mutant NinjaTurtles.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
