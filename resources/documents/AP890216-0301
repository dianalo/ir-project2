Coca-Cola said it agreed to make what it called ``two minoralterations'' in its new ads that claim a ``move is on'' fromregular Pepsi to Diet Coke.   The Atlanta-based company said the revised campaign wouldcontinue to air on network television.   ``Diet Coke wins again,'' the company said.   But Pepsi-Cola, which had complained to the networks that theDiet Coke spot was false and misleading, said the requestedalterations represented ``fundamental changes.''   ``They called a foul against Coke ... We are overjoyed,'' saidTod MacKenzie, a spokesman for Pepsi in Somers, N.Y.   At the same time, Pepsi said it had voluntarily withdrawn its adthat poked fun at how Coca-Cola came up with its claims, showingexecutives poring over soft drink statistics while wearingdistorting 3D glasses.   MacKenzie said its ad was aired only as an interim measure whilethe networks reviewed its complaint abot the Diet Coke ads.   In the original series of ads launched in late January, Coca-Colatook the unusual step of positioning Diet Coke against the sugaredversion of Pepsi.   ``Last year, nearly two million families stopped buying Pepsi andmore of them moved to Diet Coke than any other major soft drink,''the Diet Coke ads said.   After a review by the networks, Coca-Cola said it agreed tochange the second part of its claim to say, ``... and about a halfmillion of them moved to Diet Coke.''   Coca-Cola also agreed to indicate on the screen the name of theresearch company that came up with the data supporting its claim andnote that it includes both Diet Coke and caffeine-free Diet Coke.</TEXT></DOC>
