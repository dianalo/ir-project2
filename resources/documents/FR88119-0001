This change affects exemption determinations for supervisory firefighters,and a limited number of other Federal employees, at the GS-7 through GS-9levels. It corrects an unintended side effect of the regulations publishedon March 4, 1986, which resulted in significant reduction in the totalpay of most of these employees, thus causing recruitment, retention, andpay structure problems. This final rule is expected to result in determinationsthat most of these employees are nonexempt under the FLSA (covered by FLSAovertime provisions).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>February 18, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Jack Tapping, (202) 632-4530.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The changes effected by this finalrule were published for comment at 52 FR 34657 on September 14, 1987, anddistributed for information to Heads of Departments and Independent Establishmentsin Federal Personnel Manual Bulletin 551-19 on September 23, 1987. In the30-day period provided for comment, ending on October 14, 1987, OPM receivedfive comments from agencies, two comments from unions, and 26 commentsfrom employees.Generally, comments favored the proposed regulatory changes. However, severalemployees said the proposal does not go far enough and proposed that allsupervisory firefighters should be nonexempt or that all firefighters workingover a stated number of hours a week should be nonexempt. Several employeesalso said the 80 percent rule described in 5 CFR 551.204(b) of the proposedregulation should also be applied to supervisory firefighters at GS-10or higher. One employee said the 80 percent rule should be applied up througha certain organizational level, rather than through a certain GS level,in a fire department. Another employee said that the regulations shouldbe such that no supervisory firefighter would lose total pay when promotedto the next higher GS level.The common thread in these comments was the attempt to recognize a commondenominator other than GS level among supervisory firefighters, or to avoidpay inversion upon promotion from a level where the exemption test is difficultto meet (i.e., where the 80 percent rule applies) to a level where it isrelatively easy to meet (i.e., where the primary duty rule applies). Weare unable to consider the blanket nonexemption of all supervisors or nonexemptionof all employees working over a stated number of hours a week because thebasis for applying that exemption test would be something other than theduties and responsibilities performed, as required by the FLSA. Becausethere is no FLSA basis for allowing nonexemption at all levels, there wouldbe no way of assuring that some promotions will not result in a pay loss.Further, we do not believe it wise to adopt an organizational, rather thanGS, level as a basis for limiting application of the 80 percent rule. Thisis because duties and responsibilities differ at the same organizationallevel in fire departments of different sizes.We find the primary duty test is appropriate at GS-10 and above, as wasprovided for in regulation from 1974 to 1985. At these high supervisoryand management levels, there is no basis for applying the strict 80 percenttest to qualify them for FLSA overtime benefits.Another comment from two employees suggested that fire-fighters in foreignareas be covered by FLSA overtime provisions. However, section 13(f) ofthe FLSA requires exemption of foreign areas from coverage, and providesno mechanism for waiver of that requirement.Several employees and one agency focused on the definition of ``supervisoryand closely related work'' as it is used with the 80 percent rule. Theintention in this rule is to distinguish between time a supervisor spendsactually doing the same work as subordinates, and time spent accomplishingwork through subordinates. Accomplishing work through subordinates includesboth time directing their work and time planning and evaluating their work.We believe it is the responsibility of each agency headquarters to providedetailed guidance, in the context of its own work situations, on how theirdefinition will be consistently interpreted.This final rule changes the regulations prospectively at the beginningof the first pay period on or after February 18, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because it applies to federalemployees only.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 551</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Fair Labor Standards Act, Governmentemployees, Manpower training programs, Travel, Wages.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is adopting its proposed rules as published September14, 1987, (52 FR 34657) as final rules without change as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 551_PAY ADMINISTRATION UNDER THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT</ITAG>1.
