Digital, the world's second largest computer company, introducedthe VAX 8800 Series on Tuesday, boosting its mainframe capabilityand issuing another salvo in the battle to be number one.   ``It's not an earth-shattering announcement but it is a topperin terms of price and capabilities,'' said Sonny Monosson, anindependent computer analyst in Boston. ``It is very capable andwill make inroads into the IBM market.''   Maynard, Mass.-based Digital has mounted an aggressive campaignto erode IBM's dominance in mid-sized computers and largemainframes, or central processing units.   Last fall, Digital introduced two new MicroVAX computers andpositioned them as competitors with IBM's 9370, a mid-sizedcomputer that came out last summer.   In January, Digital and Apple Computer Inc. announced a jointdevelopment pact _ specifically designed to challenge IBM _ thatwould make VAX programs available on Apple's Macintosh computers.   The newest line of VAX computers is priced from $543,900 to morethan $1.7 million.   Digital said the VAX 8800 Series delivers up to four times theprocessing power of the 8700 series with multiprocessingcapabilities. The series is designed for large, multifacetedcompanies.   ``This does intensify the competition,'' said Howard Anderson,managing director of Yankee Group, a Boston-based market researchfirm. ``Historically what happened is that DEC has great softwareand underpowered computers. Every time DEC comes out with ahigh-powered machine, its users, who have been power starved, grabit up.''   Despite the announcement, Digital stock fell $4 a share to$120.37{ a share in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.   Analysts said Digital had been expected to announce new softwarein conjunction with the new computers. When the company didn't,analysts lowered their earnings forecasts, which may have helpeddepress Digital's stock price.   The company said VAX 8700s can be upgraded to the new line,which is available immediately, and analysts said they expect a60-40 split between upgrading and new sales. Analysts said theyexpect the VAX 8800 Series to offer strong competition for IBM's4300 Series and 4381 model.   ``What we have seen is that the largest users are assuming thereare only two companies acceptable for all applications _ IBM andDEC,'' Anderson said. ``Two years ago it was only IBM.''</TEXT></DOC>
