Stewart and Daniel Hertzberg (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lawyers for Ivan F. Boesky have asked for a reduction in his three-year prison term, arguing that the former arbitrager has given evidence on &quot;new topics, new transactions, new relationships, and new securities&quot; since he was sentenced last Dec. 18.    The disclosure indicates the government's insider-trading investigation -- the largest ever -- continues to spread, and that Mr. Boesky is now giving evidence about people he didn't implicate in earlier statements to the government.    Leon Silverman, Mr. Boesky's lawyer and a partner at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver andamp; Jacobson, declined to elaborate and wouldn't identify any of the new matters under scrutiny. But in an unusual request filed in a federal court here, Mr. Boesky's lawyers asked the sentencing judge to defer ruling on the motion until October, when they expect more civil and criminal charges will have been filed, and &quot;the extraordinary extent and value of Mr. Boesky's cooperation will become even more evident.&quot;    Mr. Silverman said in an interview that the October date is &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;not an unreasonable period of time,&quot; but that he has no specific knowledge of the government's plans. Nonetheless, the autumn date coincides with a recent statement by Frederick H. Joseph, chief executive officer of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the securities firm that is one of the targets of the government's investigation, that he expects no charges against Drexel at least until the fall.    The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office declined to comment, except to say that the government will file a response to Mr. Boesky's motion shortly.    The motion for a reduction in sentence confirmed previous reports that Mr. Boesky has supplied evidence in investigations of Drexel; John A. Mulheren Jr., the arbitrager who allegedly tried to kill Mr. Boesky; and various people involved in Guinness PLC's takeover of Distillers Co.    Mr. Boesky entered federal prison in Lompoc, Calif., March 23 to begin serving his term. He pleaded guilty last year to a single felony for his role in the insider-trading scandal; earlier, he paid $100 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges of insider trading. He has been actively cooperating with the government since he agreed to plead guilty in 1986.    Mr. Boesky's lawyers argued that the continuing hardship Mr. Boesky has suffered as a result of his cooperation merits a reduction in a sentence that many already consider lenient. They noted the physical danger posed by the alleged death threats, recounting that Mr. Boesky was being debriefed in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office two months ago when Mr. Mulheren left his suburban New Jersey home with loaded weapons, and that Mr. Boesky was asked to stay in the office because of the danger to his life.    The lawyers said before entering prison, Mr. Boesky had been placed under &quot;nearly constant&quot; surveillance by other subjects of the government's investigation who are seeking information to damage and discredit him as a witness. The lawyers said those implicated by Mr. Boesky have hired private investigators who &quot;watched Mr. Boesky's movements from telephone-equipped cars, followed him on the streets, questioned other patrons at establishments he utilized, and harrassed him in various other ways.&quot;    Criminal lawyers said motions for reduction of sentence, which can be made by any defendant within 120 days of sentencing, rarely succeed. But Mr. Silverman said he believes the motion has a reasonable chance of success if the judge waits to see the fruits of Mr. Boesky's cooperation. &quot;There's some equity to this,&quot; Mr. Silverman said, noting the &quot;additional toll Mr. Boesky has suffered since sentencing, particularly the Mulheren incident.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
