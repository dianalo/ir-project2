Resolution Trust Corp. officials used a computer's randomnumber selector to narrow 3,000 eligible bidders down to 60.The contracts, which are valued at millions of dollars, tomanage the real estate portfolio of University Savings ofHouston haven't been awarded yet.</LP><TEXT>   Since then, howls of protest from real estate managershave persuaded the agency to remove some -- but not all -- ofthe element of chance from its bidding system. &quot;We arecomplaining about irrational bidding,&quot; says DavidFensterheim, a Washington attorney who represents a largegroup of well-heeled thrift-asset managers, including NCNBNational Bank, Charlotte, N.C.; Chemical Banking Corp. of NewYork; and Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, and a subsidiary ofNew York financier Ronald Perelman's thrift, First GibraltarCorp., Dallas.   Under a new bidding system, the RTC is set to award 42contracts to manage $7.4 billion in assets over the next twoweeks. The asset-management contracts are for &quot;work-outspecialists,&quot; who will take control of properties of failedSandamp;Ls, fix them up and sell them, or manage difficult loanportfolios.   Industry protests also spurred the agency to widen bidsolicitations for a nationwide computer system to track theRTC's vast real estate holdings. Initially, just 30 firmswere invited to bid. &quot;The word hit the street immediately,&quot;says Thomas Horton, in charge of the RTC contracting, &quot;and wehad complaints everywhere.&quot; This past Wednesday, the agencysent out solicitations to 204 firms.   The RTC, operating under procurement rules spelled out inlast year's Sandamp;L bailout law, can't just select the cheapestbidder or the most experienced bidder. The agency mustinclude women and minority contractors and take pains toallow every interested bidder at least a theoretical shot oflanding the work. The RTC had to hire, for example, anAmerican Indian consultant in North Dakota to help deal withcertain land in the Northwest. The agency must also screenout individuals who have contributed to past Sandamp;L losses.   &quot;It's obviously a contrived system,&quot; says Mr. Horton. &quot;Wehave to be fair and open, or we are accused of steering theseto inside favorites.&quot;   Under its new system, the RTC will send letters describingparticular contracts to every eligible bidder on its list ofpotential contractors. Those who respond that they haveinterest and experience will be put into a pool. From thispool, 30 are selected to bid on each contract, with women andminority contractors included, plus a mix of first-time andexperienced bidders. The final contract is awarded on priceand technical quality.   &quot;It's a dramatic improvement from the previous approach,&quot;says Mr. Fensterheim. &quot;But that doesn't mean they should giveup trying to get the best people, and eliminate theirrationality.&quot;   So far, 7,313 contractors are on the RTC's list ofpotential contractors, claiming expertise in one area oranother. The huge number, the RTC says, slows the biddingprocess, because too few are actually experienced atforeclosing on complex, and often fraud-ridden real estateloans.   &quot;Everybody and his brother is out there calling himself anasset manager,&quot; says Lamar Kelly, director of the RTC'sdivision of asset and real estate management. &quot;Frankly, weare looking very hard at these start-up firms to see if theyhave demonstrated experience in handling these problems.&quot;   This week, the agency will also begin awarding hugecontracts to manage the bulk of the RTC's residential realestate. The agency will solicit bids to manage and sellthousands of repossessed homes in San Antonio, Houston andDallas. The contracts will be worth millions over time, Mr.Horton says.   On Friday, the RTC selected Lowe Enterprises, a LosAngeles company, to manage one of the agency's largest singlereal estate assets, the Banning-Lewis Ranch, ColoradoSprings, Colo., a $250 million property stretching across 13miles. The contract is for $39,500 a month, and a sales pricepercentage that declines over time.</TEXT></DOC>
