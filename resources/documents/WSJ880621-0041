In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Stiegemeier said he met with Frank Feitz, ABI's president, June 15 to discuss a possible acquisition of ABI, either by Mr. Stiegemeier alone or with others. No specific terms were discussed or agreed upon, the filing said. ABI, based in Irvine, Calif., distributes telephone systems for commercial customers.    Mr. Stiegemeier said he is now in the process of determining the price, if any, that he intends to offer for the shares and whether to include other participants. He is also trying to determine the method and amount of financing for such an acquisition.    According to the filing, Mr. Stiegemeier holds 90,860 ABI common shares, or 5.4% of the common outstanding.    In May, ABI said it decided not to proceed with a pact to be acquired by a unit of TIE/communications Inc. after ABI's financial adviser withdrew its opinion that terms of the offer were fair.    Terms of the pact with Shelton, Conn.-based TIE, which makes and sells telephone systems, had called for ABI holders to receive for each share either 2.636 shares of TIE common stock, or $7 and one TIE share. In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, ABI closed at $10.375 a share, up $1.50. TIE closed at $2.50, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
