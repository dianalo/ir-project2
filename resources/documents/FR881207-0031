Purpose of This NoticeIn the course of administering the Clean Air Act, EPA often has been calledupon to interpret the law where Congress has left a gap that must be filled.But few of EPA's prior determinations have been so difficult, or threatenedsuch upheaval, as the judgment we must now make about the ozone and carbonmonoxide problems in the South Coast Basin that surrounds Los Angeles.Ozone is a pollutant with serious health effects that, as we are increasinglybecoming aware, may cause permanent long-term damage if breathed at certainconcentrations. The effects are unmistakable at levels commonly encounteredin the Los Angeles area, which has the worst ozone problem in the UnitedStates, suffering from both the highest levels and the most frequent violationsof the national ozone standard.CO reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to all tissues of the body, and,at certain levels, poses a threat to human health. The Basin frequentlyviolates the federal air quality standards for CO.EPA wants to_and must_do something constructive to remedy this unacceptablepublic health threat. But, in its present form, the law intended to addressthe problem cannot deal with it effectively. This is because the last statutorydeadline for a plan to meet the standard_December 31, 1987_has now passed,and Congress has given EPA no instructions as to what to do under thesecircumstances.EPA has acknowledged a duty under the Clean Air Act to develop a federalimplementation plan (FIP) to help the South Coast Basin attain the primarynational ambient air quality (NAAQS) standard for ozone and carbon monoxide(CO).\1\<NOTE/> But the Act does not specify the date by which such a planmust project attainment. Since the deadline has passed, and Congress hasnot extended it, must an EPA plan require immediate attainment? Or shouldit call for attainment within a period (three to five years) analogousto the relevant previous rounds of planning required by the statute (specifically,section 110 (a) and (e), and the second round of planning for areas thatreceived attainment date extensions from 1982 to 1987 under Section 172(a)(2))?Attainment of the ozone NAAQS appears to require, in the case of the SouthCoast Basin, extreme restrictions on the use of fossil fuels and the reactivehydrocarbons that are now essential components of many industrial, commercial,and consumer products and activities. It is for this reason that an immediateor a near-term attainment FIP for the South Coast, if determined to bestatutorily required, would raise serious questions of enforceability andpotential conflicts with other statutes. As a practical matter, immediateattainment is impossible and a five-year plan would impose requirementsso draconian as to remake life in the South Coast Basin.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>Coalition for Clean Air </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>CV No. 88-4414-H. (C.D. Cal.) In an Order dated September19, 1988, the Court affirmed that EPA has such a duty.The South Coast authorities estimate that an 80 to 90 percent reductionin volatile organic compound (``VOC'') emissions is necessary to attainthe ozone standard. Thus a plan that provides for attainment in the SouthCoast immediately or even within five years would have to prohibit mosttraffic, shut down major business activity, curtail the use of importantconsumer goods, and dramatically restrict all aspects of social and economiclife. Implementation and enforcement of such drastic measures may wellbe impossible, and could prevent satisfaction of the basic necessitiesof life_including food, shelter, and medical services. Such a plan wouldeffectively usurp many state and local government functions and would radicallyrestrict individual opportunity. Indeed, an immediate or a near-term attainmentFIP for ozone would destroy the economy of the South Coast, so that mostof the population would be forced to resettle elsewhere. Similar drasticconsequences would flow from a short-term plan to attain the CO standard.Given these consequences of short-term plans, should EPA instead allowa longer term for attainment_one that supports local efforts in makingprogress over a period such as the twenty years provided for in the planunder consideration by the South Coast Air Quality Management District(SCAQMD)? Such a course appeals to common sense, but is without precedentin the Act.A long-term FIP might appear to offer a more realistic (though still exceedinglydifficult) path to attainment, and would complement ongoing state and localefforts to develop a SIP. But it also raises significant issues. Such aFIP would require EPA to make difficult legislative-type decisions aboutthe projected pace and direction of technological and life-style change,over a long period of time. A long-term plan would have more gradual andless dislocating impacts than a short-term FIP, but would still have profoundimplications for much of the local economy, for some national and foreignindustries, and for the entire way of life in the South Coast Basin. Moreover,in either circumstance, EPA arguably must to some extent exercise legislative-typepowers that, while perhaps permitted by the courts (<T3>see Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. </T3>v. <T3>NRDC. </T3>467 U.S. 837 (1984)), are more appropriately exercised byCongress. Nonetheless, in the absence of legislative direction, EPA believesit may need to resolve several fundamental issues of legislative scopeto comply with its legal obligation to develop a FIP for the South Coast.The Agency believes that, in fulfilling this obligation, it should seekto act consistently with at least the key principles underlying the statute,while minimizing the extent to which EPA performs legislative-type decisionmaking.As discussed in detail below, this is a very difficult task. EPA officialshave repeatedly urged the 100th Congress to come to grips with this issueand to amend and extend the Clean Air Act. Their failure to do so leavesEPA with no course other than to press on and try to discern, as best theAgency can, what the prior enacting Congress would have intended us todo. Because the issues before us are of such moment and complexity, EPA wishesto explore them in a detailed and public fashion. To that end we are publishingtoday EPA's preliminary view of the problem it confronts, the approachesit might choose to solve that problem, and the consequences that are likelyto follow from that choice. B. Outline of Notice The Notice begins by setting out the legislative and regulatory historyof the Clean Air Act and its Amendments with respect to the control ofozone and CO, both nationally and in the South Coast Basin. This historyrecounts EPA's prior futile attempt to impose FIPs on the South Coast andother areas in the 1970's. It describes EPA's recent proposal on requirementsfor state plans in areas that, by the end of 1987, have not attained theair quality standards for these pollutants. The Notice then proceeds toidentify the perplexing technical, legal, and policy questions EPA confrontsin constructing a practicable and effective FIP for the South Coast. Itdescribes the severity of pollution problems in the South Coast_with respectto ozone, plainly the worst in the Nation, and with respect to CO, oneof the worst. Although air quality has improved as a result of the effortsof local governmental agencies, the ozone and CO problems have proved intractabledue to the environmental consequences of economic and population growthin a geographically enclosed region. Local authorities in the South Coasthave labored for years to put together an ambitious draft pollution abatementplan that is intended to provide for attainment of the standard for COin ten years, and for attainment of the standard for ozone in twenty years.The Notice outlines the draft South Coast plan, expected to be submittedto EPA in the spring of 1989. Next, the Notice considers the statutory provisions that define EPA's dutyto promulgate a FIP. It sets forth the applicable principles of statutoryinterpretation that govern our reading of these provisions and their legislativehistory. Included among the judicial maxims that guide EPA's interpretationare: (1) Where Congressional intent is unclear, EPA must construe the statutein accordance with its terms, history, and purposes, and may reach reasonableaccommodations among conflicting interests; (2) EPA should construe thestatute so as to avoid absurd results and impossibility; and (3) EPA shouldconstrue the statute to avoid conflicts with other statutes. The Notice proceeds to apply these principles in discussing three differentinterpretations of the post-1987 deadline for a FIP to show attainment.The alternative interpretations of the FIP deadline are: (1) Immediateattainment; (2) attainment within five years; (3) attainment over a longterm, but as expeditiously as possible without causing severe economicand social disruption. The Notice describes the legal and equitable argumentsfor and against each alternative, and outlines the type of FIP each deadlinewould require. The Notice recognizes that each of these alternative interpretations hassignificant strengths and weaknesses, and that none of them presents aneasy resolution of the vexing legal and environmental problems that besetthe South Coast. At this point, it appears difficult to project attainmentof the standards in the South Coast Basin, even under a plan stretchingover twenty years, and containing measures that require some serious economicand social dislocation. In filling the gap in the current statute, EPA must attempt to reconcileconflicting Congressional values embodied in the Clean Air Act, and eachof the interpretations advanced fulfills different of these values to varyingdegrees. The immediate and five-year FIP interpretations_while satisfyingan arguable Congressional desire for short-term attainment dates_wouldimpose health control measures that would disrupt daily life in the SouthCoast beyond anything Congress might have envisioned, or that would beimpossible to enforce, even with gargantuan efforts. The longer-term FIP approach, while mitigating economic disruption by offeringthe possibility of more realistic and workable requirements, representsa departure from EPA's prior interpretations of the Act, and arguably putsEPA in shoes that only Congress should fill. While any significant extensionof the attainment date beyond 1987 would necessarily reflect some legislative-typegap-filling by EPA, a longer-term plan might impose upon the Agency theresponsibility for making especially difficult legislative choices aboutthe direction and pace of technological, social, and economic change inthe South Coast.   EPA solicits comment on how it should interpret the Clean Air Act to providean appropriate attainment date for a FIP under the circumstances presentedhere. We seek comments on the legal interpretations we present, on whetherEPA should explore any alternatives that it has not considered, on whatEPA should conclude to be the most appropriate FIP attainment date underthe current Act, and on what form the FIP should take.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Statutory and Regulatory Background</ITAG>This section discusses the historical development of the Clean Air Actand how the South Coast has attempted to comply with its requirements.Included is a review of EPA's development of several short-term attainmentFIPs in response to the Act and litigation, and the subsequent failureof these plans because of political, judicial and public opposition. The federal government first became involved in the regulation of air pollutionin 1955 with the passage of the Air Pollution Control Act, Pub. L. No.84-159, 69 Stat. 322 (1955). This statute, as expanded in 1963 in the CleanAir Act, Pub. L. No. 88-206, 77 Stat. 392 (1963), provided technical andfinancial assistance to encourage the States to define and address theproblem of air pollution. When the States failed to respond adequatelyto this encouragement, the federal government increased its role, primarilyby the passage of the 1970 Clean Air Act. A. The 1970 Clean Air ActIn 1970, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to establish a joint Stateand Federal program to control air pollution. New sections 109 and 110of the statute directed EPA to establish in 1971 NAAQS for such pollutantsas photochemical oxidants (currently measured as ozone and therefore referredto here as ozone) and CO, and these sections called on States to submitby early 1972 ``State Implementation Plans'' (SIPs), providing for attainmentof those standards within nine months of promulgation of the NAAQS. Section 110(a)(2) of the 1970 statute specifies the requirements for theseinitial SIPs. It directs EPA to approve a SIP within four months afterits submission if, among other things, it ``provides for the attainment''of the standard ``as expeditiously as practicable but [subject to subsection(e)] in no case later than 3 years from the date of approval of such plan* * *.'' The law (section 110(a)(2)(H) also directs each State to reviseits SIP whenever the Administrator finds that it is ``substantially inadequate''to achieve the NAAQS or otherwise meet the requirements of the Act. Section 110(e) permits a two-year extension of the three-year atainmentperiod if the technology to attain within three years is not availableand the State has applied ``reasonably available alternative means'' ofattaining the standard in the interim. In the event a State fails to submitan approvable SIP or fails to submit a plan to promulgate its own implementationmeasures, section 110(c) directs EPA to make up this failure, by promulgatinga FIP. Finally, under section 110(a)(3), a State may revise its plan atany time, but EPA may approve the change only if the SIP continues to conformto the requirements of the Act. B. Implementation of the Act in the 1970's<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Implementation of the Act Nationally: 1970-1977</ITAG>In August 1971, EPA recognized that many States would find it extremelydifficult if not impossible to attain primary standards \2\<NOTE/> by 1975, that is, roughly within three years of the timetheir SIPs would be approved.\3\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the Agency bowed to reality and granted blankettwo-year extensions to all control regions that, even given the applicationof reasonably available technology, could not attain primary air qualitystandards by 1975. EPA also extended (or, as we shall see, tried to extend)another statutory deadline. Section 110(a)(1) required States to submit,by January 30, 1972, the transportation control portions of their plansfor controlling ozone and CO. EPA, following the statute, required transportationcontrol plans for all areas in which stationary source controls and federalemissions standards for new cars would not be sufficient to attain complianceby May 31, 1975. EPA proposed to move the deadline for submitting theseplans from January 30, 1972 to February 1973.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Section 109(b)(1), 42 U.S.C. 7609(b)(1) defines the primarystandards as ``ambient air quality standards the attainment and maintenanceof which, in the judgment of the Administrator, based upon such [air quality]criteria and allowing an adequate margin of safety, are required to protectthe public health.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ EPA arrived at the year 1975 by adding together: ninemonths (after the 1971 NAAQS promulgation) in which the SIPs were to besubmitted to EPA, four months for EPA to act on the SIPs, and three yearsfrom the date of approval in which to attain.EPA's efforts to read the law in the light of the real world problems ofimplementing it, however, were stymied in 1973, when the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held illegal EPA'sgrant of the one-year extension for States to submit the transportationcontrol portions of SIPs. <T3>See Natural Resource Defense Council</T3> (<T3>NRDC</T3>) v. <T3>EPA, </T3>475 F.2d 968 970-71 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The Court also orderedEPA to rescind its blanket two-year extension for NAAQS attainment. Furthermoreit held that the Agency could allow additional extensions only if the requestingStates had demonstrated under section 110(e) that, even given the applicationof reasonably available alternative technologies, they could not achieveair quality standards by 1975. <T3>Id.</T3> at 971. Thus, States were still required to produce SIPs showingattainment by 1975 in order to obtain an extension of the deadline to 1977.Finally the Court ordered EPA to promulgate the necessary plans under section110(c) by September 1975. The decision in <T3>NRDC</T3> gave EPA a broad mandate to develop transportation controlprograms to attain the standards by 1977. The obstacles to the States' attainment of air pollution control deadlinessoon grew even greater. Under an agreement with NRDC, in April, 1973, EPAissued ambitious guidelines regulating a broad range of non-point or ``indirect''pollution sources_including not only shopping centers and highways, forexample, but also residential and commercial developments. These guidelineshad the attention of NRDC and ultimately the courts, which, under the languageof the law, directed EPA to promulgate them. Few States followed them,however. Technical problems, political opposition, and legal difficultiescompelled the Agency to narrow the scope of these guidelines and to proposeits own indirect source review (ISR) program.EPA's attempt in its own ISR program to interpret the law to make it morepracticable, however, faltered once again. EPA lacked the resources necessaryto implement and to enforce its ISR program. The final regulations EPApublished in 1974, therefore, failed to offer the technical support necessaryfor carrying them out. Because it operated under short-term deadlines,the ISR Program, moreover, had to apply fairly severe remedies_and it couldnot wait for better ones to be developed. And so, bearing questionableenvironmental results, confronted by various legal challenges, and troubledby technical infeasibility, the ISR Program, for all its lofty ambitions,became the victim of the same problems that doomed the earlier ISR guidelines.Perhaps recognizing this problem, Congress, in section 110(a)(5) of the1977 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, prohibited EPA from conducting ISR(except for federally funded projects) and allowed the states to rescindpreviously published proposals. This was not the last obstacle to EPA's efforts to improve air quality.EPA's transportation control program proved no more edifying than its attemptat enforcing ISR guidelines. In light of the <T3>NRDC</T3> holding, states would not be eligible even for two-year extensionsunder section 110(e) until they submitted plans showing attainment by 1975.States therefore submitted such plans_whether or not for <T3>pro forma</T3> reasons_in which they endorsed costly and possibly unworkablemeasures that would, colorably, attain air quality standards by the 1975deadline. (The states might have considered that these measures, or manyof them, might be rendered superfluous in any case by 1977, when the fleetof emission-controlled cars began to take over the highways and cause lowerlevels of ozone and CO.) Accordingly, states may have begun to write SIPsthat they knew to be partly fictional in order to obtain the extensionsthey required to make realistic progress toward air pollution goals. When several states, rather than submitting SIPs they knew to be unworkable,balked at submitting plans showing attainment by 1975, EPA was forced topromulgate its own transportation controls programs for them. Thus, in1973, EPA proposed control strategies containing a combination of far-reachingmeasures, including parking restrictions, mandatory bus and carpool lanes,and expansion of mass transit. Some of these provisions, however, ran intoinsurmountable political opposition. In early 1974, for example, Congresspassed a provision, ultimately codified in the Energy Supply and EnvironmentalCoordination Act of 1974, prohibiting EPA from imposing surcharges on feesfor parking cars. By 1977, EPA found itself in a double bind. On the one side, the courts,as in <T3>NRDC,</T3> held EPA firmly to the deadlines that were explicitly statedor implied in the Clean Air Act. If the states did not submit plans toattain air quality standards by those dates, EPA would be required to prepareplans, programs, or guidelines to make up for this failure. Hence, EPA'sefforts at ISR review, transportation control programs, and the like. On the other side, in a series of cases challenging EPA's legal and constitutionalauthority to adopt various transportation controls and other measures,the courts found that EPA had overstepped its statutory and constitutionalauthority in telling states what to do to clean up their air. For example, in <T3>Brown v. EPA, </T3>521 F.2d 827 (9th Cir. 1977), vacated on mootnessgrounds in <T3>EPA v. Brown,</T3> 431 U.S. 99 (1977), the 1973 California transportationcontrol plan was challenged.There, the United States Court of Appeals forthe Ninth Circuit ruled that the Clean Air Act ``permits sanctions againsta State that pollutes the air, but not against a State that chooses notto govern pollutants as the Administrator directs.'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 839. The court ruled, in effect, that the Agency coulddirect States to improve air quality or to stop pollution within theirboundaries, but EPA could not require States to pass legislation that affectedthe polluting behavior of individual citizens. The plaintiffs in <T3>Brown</T3>, moreover, challenged the constitutionality of EPA's transportationcontrol regulations on Tenth Amendment and Commerce Clause grounds. <T3>Id. </T3>at 837-842. Although the court expressed serious misgivingsabout whether the regulations would pass ocnstitutional muster, it choseto rest its opinion solely on statutory grounds. <T3>Id. </T3>at 840. <T3>See also District of Columbia </T3>v. <T3>Train,</T3> 521 F.2d 971 (D.C. Cir. 1975) <T3>vacated </T3>431 U.S. 99 (1977) (Act did not support Administrator'sregulations, which required states to enact statutes).\4\<NOTE/> Other hastily prepared FIPs that included transportationcontrols were challenged and overturned for lack of adequate technicalsupport. <T3>See, e.q., Texas </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>499 F.2d 289 (5th Cir. 1974) <T3>cert. denied</T3> 427 U.S. 905 (1976) (Texas FIP); <T3>South Terminal Corp.</T3> v. <T3>EPA, </T3>504 F.2d 646 (1st Cir. 1974) (Boston FIP). Lacking judicialand political support, generating nothing but public outrage, and drainingresources, EPA's FIP efforts eventually failed. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ With respect to the state inspection and maintenance regulation,<T3>Brown,</T3> along with other cases from the Fourth and District ofColumbia Circuits, was granted <T3>certiorari </T3>by the Supreme Court. When EPA admitted that it lackedauthority under the act to force states to enforce EPA-promulgated transportationcontrol programs, the Court declined to rule on the program, as its rulingwould amount to an advisory opinion, and remanded the cases for considerationof mootness and ripeness. <T3>EPA</T3> v. <T3>Brown</T3> 431 U.S. 104 (1977). <T3>See also Brown </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>566 F.2d 665 (9th Cir. 1977) (holding EPA's inspection andmaintenance program for California invalid).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Implementation of the Act in California: 1970-1977 </ITAG>California submitted its SIP for ozone and CO to EPA in February 1972.In May of the same year, EPA Administrator William Ruckelshaus disapprovedthe plan because it failed to show attainment by the deadline stated inthe Act 1975. When EPA failed to promulgate a FIP under section 110(c)within six months of its disapproval of the SIPs for Los Angeles, a LosAngeles-based public interest group brought suit. In <T3>City of Riverside </T3>v. <T3>Ruckelshaus, </T3>4 E.R.C. 1728 (C.D. Cal. 1972), the U.S. DistrictCourt for the Central District of California ordered EPA to produce byJanuary 15, 1973 a plan adequate to bring Los Angeles_an area plagued withthe worst air pollution in the country_into attainment by 1975 (three yearsfrom adoption of the plan) or 1977 (if the governor requested a two-yearextension). Ruckelshaus obeyed the order by proposing a plan that included, among othertraffic control measures, a provision that would have required reducinggasoline supplies by 82 percent by the summer of 1977. 38 FR 2194 (1973).As Ruckelshaus explained to the citizens of Los Angeles, ``Faced with thechoice between my freedom and your mobility, my freedom wins.'' R. ShepMelnick, <T3>Regulation and the Courts: The Case of the Clean Air Act, at 331-22(1983). </T3>With the intention of drawing wide public and Congressionalattention to the dilemma presented EPA by the Clean Air Act, EPA held publichearings in 1972. The plan was decried by all concerned. On July 2, 1973, the Administrator proposed a revised plan that set forththree options. Under the first option, literal compliance with the Actwould be achieved through 100% gasoline rationing. Nothing else would doto meet the letter of the law. Under the second, gasoline consumption wouldbe limited to 1972-3 levels and other transportation control measures wouldbe introduced. Finally, under the third option, only existing control measureswould be implemented. Again, the plans were assailed as unduly restrictiveand unworkable.On October 12, 1973, the Administrator announced a third attempt at formulatinga plan for the Los Angeles area. 38 FR 31232. This third plan includedseveral specific and drastic transportation control measures. It requiredthe use of specified freeway lanes and surface streets exclusively by busesand carpools. In addition, by imposing a surcharge on commercial parkingrates, it called for a radical change in the Basin's parking rate structure.It also imposed initial annual surcharges on free parking spaces providedby businesses to their customers.The plan went further. Employers were to impose a charge on employee parkingspaces; they also were to provide employees with various other incentivesto use carpools and mass transit systems. Portions of the funds collectedwere to be used to support mass transit facilities. The final plan alsoincluded a provision stipulating that literal compliance with the CleanAir Act would require a further reduction of vehicle miles traveled, andthat gasoline limitations would be necessary. Commenting on the plan, theAdministrator asserted: ``The EPA does not believe that massive gasolinerationing is either socially acceptable or enforceable, and will work towardalleviating the necessity for such drastic control in 1977.'' <T3>See</T3> Chernow, Implementing the Clean Air Act in Los Angeles; theDuty to Achieve the Impossible, 4 <T3>Ecol. L.Q.</T3> 537, 553 (1975). (<T3>citing</T3> 38 FR 31232, 31237 (1973)).These transportation control measures pleased the public no more than theirpredecessors. Soon after promulgation of the plan, plaintiffs filed manysuits to enjoin the plan's enforcement, and the Administrator deferredthe effective date of its more extreme provisions. 38 FR 34124 (1973).Eventually, EPA's authority to promulgate gas rationing regulations wasupheld, <T3>see City of Santa Rosa v. EPA,</T3> 534 F.2d 150, 154 (9th Cir. 1976).Public outrage at the Ruckelshaus plan ultimately led to its withdrawalin 1976. In explaining his rationale for withdrawal of the plan, ActingAdministrator John Quarles stated: ``I realize that this revocation willrender the affected SIP defective as a legal matter, since such SIPs willno longer contain regulations which provide for NAAQS attainment. I amconvinced, however, that whatever benefits may be gained from keeping atechnically legal SIP on the books by retaining the gasoline rationingregulations are outweighed by the seriously disruptive social and economicconsequences of such regulations.'' <T3>See</T3> 41 FR 45565 (Oct. 15, 1976). The withdrawal went unchallenged.C. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977Congress in 1977 amended the Clean Air Act in response to persistent nonattainmentof the NAAQS for ozone and CO and in reaction to the failed FIP and SIPefforts of the early 1970's. The House of Representatives Report on a billto amend the Act (H.R. 6161) reviewed the history of the EPA Administrator'sinability to use section 110(c)(1) promulgations to achieve the statutoryobjectives. H. Rep. No. 6161, 95-294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., <T3>reprinted in </T3>4 Legislative History of the Clean Air Act Amendmentsof 1977, at 2748-55 (1978). The Report noted that ``this is a delicatearea of Federal-State relations. Clearly, a careful balance is requiredas a matter of wise legislative policy, if not as a matter of constitutionalrequirement.'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 2755.The Committee Report therefore concluded that the wisest course was toadopt ``an approach that is intended to involve the least possible intrusioninto State affairs consistent with the primary task of protecting publichealth.'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 4 <T3>Legislative History</T3> 2755. Noting that, ``as a practical matter,State and local governments are in a better position than EPA to resolvethose pollution problems, which involve millions of motor vehicles, throughinspection and maintenance programs and similar measures,'' the Reportstressed the need to induce States voluntarily to adopt and implement theirown transportation control programs. <T3>Id.</T3>Similarly, the Committee Report on the Senate bill (S. 252) stated thatthe transportation control aspects of the bill had been designed to takeinto account that ``[t]he Federal Government does not have and will nothave the resources to do an effective job of running the air pollutioncontrol programs of the State.'' S. Rep. No. 95-127, 95th Cong., 1st Sess.10 (1977), <T3>reprinted in </T3>3 <T3>Legislative History </T3>at 1384-85. The Senate committee noted that``transportation planning'', in particular, ``is a local political process''and that any amendments to the Act should create incentives for local planningand remedy the ``lack of local involvement in the process''. <T3>Id.</T3> at 3 <T3>Legislative History,</T3> 1412.Conceding that the plans had ``imposed vast economic and social costs forrelatively small improvement in the quality of the environment,'' CleanAir Act Amendments of 1977, H. Rep. 95-294, pp. 228-29, S. Rep. 95-127(GPO, 1977, p. 14), Congress extended the Act's deadlines and created anew Part D, a planning process to get the States to revise the SIPs forareas that were exceeding the standards.The new Section 107(d) required EPA, by roughly March 1978, to identifythose areas that in August 1977 were still experiencing NAAQS violations.The States were then required by January 1, 1979, to adopt and submit suchrevisions to the SIPs for these ``nonattainment'' areas that would meetthe requirements of Part D and the new section 110(a)(2)(I). Section 129(c).Under Part D, each revision was to provide for attainment of the relevantprimary NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable, but in general no laterthan December 31, 1982. Section 172(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 7502(a)(1). A revisioncould provide for attainment of the primary standards for ozone and COas late as December 31, 1987, if the State demonstrated that attainmentby the 1982 deadline was not possible, despite the implementation of allreasonably available control measures (RACM). Section 172(a)(2).In any event, each revision due in 1979 was to provide for the implementationof RACM and for ``reasonable further progress'' (RFP)_defined as annualincremental reductions in emissions sufficient in EPA's judgment to providefor attainment by the applicable deadline, including such reduction asmay be obtained through the adoption of ``reasonably available controltechnology'' (RACT). Sections 172(6)(3), 171(1).Each revision also was to have, among other things, a permit program forthe preconstruction review of major new sources of the relevant pollutants.Section 172(b)(6). As outlined by section 173 of the Act, the permit programwould allow construction even before attainment occurs, upon a determinationthat (1) the source would have state-of-the-art controls; (2) its emissionswould be offset by greater than one-for-one reductions elsewhere, or wouldbe accounted for in an approved demonstration of attainment by the applicabledate for the area in which the source was locating; (3) the applicant'sother sources in the state were in compliance with the SIP; and (4) thestate was carrying out the SIP.With respect to the areas with 1987 deadlines (<T3>i.e.</T3>, ``extension'' areas), each revision due in 1979 had to identifyany measures beyond RACM that would be necessary to assure timely attainment,and it had to continue commitments to adopt a motor vehicle inspectionand maintenance program. In addition, each state with an ``extension''area was to submit a supplemental revision before July 1, 1982, containingthose additional measures necessary to assure attainment in those areasby the end of 1987. Section 129(c).As part of the 1977 Amendments, section 110(a)(2)(I) required a constructionban that would operate against major new sources and major modificationsof existing sources of the relevant pollutants in each nonattainment areaafter June 30, 1979, ``* * * unless, as of the time of application of apermit for such construction * * *, such pain meets the requirements ofPart D * * *.''As further incentive for timely submission of Part D SIP revisions, Congressadded sections 176(a) and 316(b). Section 176(a) bars the Department ofTransportation from funding certain highway projects, and EPA from makingair program grants in an ozone or CO nonattainment area, upon a determinationby EPA that the State has failed to make ``reasonable'' efforts to submitSIP revisions for the area that meet Part D requirements. Section 316(b)authorizes EPA to withhold certain grants for sewage treatment constructionwhere an area has failed, among other things, to submit an adequate PartD SIP for the area.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Congress also added two other funding sanctions for failureto implement a SIP. First, it extended the discretionary withholding ofsewage treatment grants under section 316 to such failures. Second, itprovided in section 176(b) for a withholding of air grants for any areain which the State is not implementing an applicable SIP. Beyond thosefunding sanctions, the requirement in section 173(4) operates, in effect,as a ban on the construction of major new sources in the event that a Stateis not ``carrying out'' its SIP. This means that, even when the SIP fora designated nonattainment area has been approved and is adequate, thearea may become subject to a construction ban if it fails to carry outthe SIP.D. History of Regulatory Development Under Part D<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Implementation of Part D Nationally: 1978-1985</ITAG>The EPA began its administration of Part D with the promulgation in 1978of attainment status designations under section 107(d). <T3>See</T3>, <T3>e.g.</T3>, 43 FR 8962 (March 3, 1978); 43 FR 40502 (September 12, 1978).Then, on April 4, 1979, EPA published a notice describing in detail theprerequisites to EPA approval of the SIP revisions that Part D requiredthe states to submit in 1979 for areas that were designated nonattainment(44 FR 20372).On July 2, 1979, EPA issued an interpretive rule establishing that theconstruction ban in section 110(a)(2)(I) would begin to operate immediatelyin any designated nonattainment area that was not yet covered by an approvedPart D SIP (44 FR 38471 [now codified at 40 CFR 52.24(a) (1987)]. At thetime, EPA had yet to approve a Part D SIP for any ozone or CO nonattainmentarea, so the ban came into effect in all of them. Gradually, the statessubmitted for most of these areas the first round of Part D SIP revisionsthat were due at the beginning of 1979, and EPA approved or conditionallyapproved these revisions. Thus, by the end of 1982, most ozone and CO nonattainmentareas were free of the ban.With respect to areas, like the South Coast, that had received an extensionof the attainment date for CO or ozone to the end of 1987, EPA issued anew policy describing the criteria it would use to judge the supplementalSIP revisions that were due for such extension areas in mid-1982. 46 FR7182 (January 22, 1981). The Agency received 1982 SIP revisions from allextension areas and approved many of them as adequate to produce attainmentby the end of 1987. <T3>See</T3>, <T3>e.g.</T3>, 48 FR 51472 (November 9, 1983) (New Jersey, ozone); 50 FR25073 (June 17, 1985) (New York City, ozone and CO). EPA also disapprovedthe SIPs for some extension areas and imposed the construction ban undersection 110(a)(2)(I). <T3>See</T3>, <T3>e.g.</T3>, 50 FR 8616 (March 4, 1985) (Albuquerque, CO).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Implementation of Part D in the South Coast: 1978-1984</ITAG>In the initial round of section 107 nonattainment designations in 1978,EPA found the South Coast in nonattainment for both CO and ozone. Severalyears after EPA's July 2, 1979 imposition of the section 110(a)(2)(I) constructionmoratorium, California submitted and EPA approved the 1979 Part D SIP forthe area. As a result of that approval, on November 25, 1983, the Agencylifted the construction ban that it had imposed in July 1979. (48 FR 53114).As part of the initial round of Part D SIP planning, the State of Californiarequested that EPA approve an extension of the statutory attainment dateto December 31, 1987 for CO and ozone for the South Coast. EPA approvedthe request. The State then submitted 1982 updates for the ozone and COSIPs for the South Coast. Although these SIP revisions included controlmeasures that would produce expeditious progress toward attainment of theapplicable standards, the State conceded that the revisions did not demonstratethat the area would attain the standard by the statutory date of December31, 1987. As a result EPA proposed to disapprove the plan on February 3,1983. 48 FR 5074.In final rulemaking published July 30, 1984 (49 FR 30300), however, EPAapproved the emission control measures in the CO and ozone extension SIPs,on the ground that they strengthened the SIP. In addition, in that samerulemaking, EPA held open the question of whether the attainment and reasonablefurther progress (RFP) demonstrations in the South Coast SIP submittalsmet the requirements of Part D. In September 1984, a citizen named MarkAbramowitz filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for theNinth Circuit, seeking review of EPA's July 30, 1984 decision. <T3>See Abramowitz </T3>v. <T3>EPA</T3>, 832 F.2d 1071 (9th Cir. 1987).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. The Reasonable Extra Efforts Program: 1984-1987 </ITAG>Beginning approximately in 1984, EPA began to explore how it might addressthe likelihood that many extension areas, as well as some non-extensionareas that had already received SIP calls,\6\<NOTE/> would not attain the ozone and CO standards in the near termwith their existing SIPs and pending SIP revisions. In particular, EPAbegan to consider withholding disapprovals of the pending plan revisionsand deferring sanctions where, though the states had failed to demonstrateattainment of the standards by the end of 1987 (or even shortly thereafter),they had submitted commitments to adopt all control measures that becamereasonably available. EPA solicited comment on whether such an approach,as applied to the South Coast Air Basin and three other California (extension)areas, would be consistent with the Act. <T3>See </T3>51 FR 34428 (September 26, 1986) (soliciting comment on the``Reasonable Extra Efforts Program'' (``REEP'') for four areas in California).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Under section 110(a)(2)(H), 42 U.S.C. 7610(a)(2)(H), EPAmay call for a SIP revision whenever the Administrator finds that the planis ``substantially inadequate'' to achieve the NAAQS or in other respectsfails to comply with the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments. After reviewing the language and legislative history of the relevant provisionsof the Act,\7\<NOTE/> EPA concluded that the REEP approach, as well as a similarapproach called the ``Sustained Progress Program'' (``SPP''), would beinconsistent with the Act_both for extension areas that had not yet receivedapproval of their Part D SIPs and for areas that, though receiving suchapprovals, needed to revise their SIPs in response to notices of SIP deficiencyunder section 110(a)(2)(H). 52 FR 26404, 26.407 (July 14, 1987) (GeneralPreamble). With regard to applying REEP and SPP to areas without approvedPart D SIP's, EPA stated:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ This analysis appears in a memorandum of EPA's GeneralCounsel dated November 25, 1986. The evaluation in this memorandum is reflectedin the General Preamble discussed in the text below. <ITAG tagnum="21">On its face Part D * * * contemplates an entirely different planningprocess [from REEP], under which such an areas [sic] must develop withina set period a full plan to produce attainment by a fixed near-term deadline.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The only argument supporting REEP in the face of this statutory languageis the one sketched by EPA in its REEP proposal and by industry in itscomments, namely, that some extension areas could produce attainment bythe end of 1987 only by the application of measures that would tear theeconomic and social fabric of the areas and that the 95th Congress couldnot really have intended the areas to put such draconian measures intoenforceable form and actually begin to implement them. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The argument, however, misses the point * * *. In fact, the legislativehistory shows that the Congress set up the Part D system in order to forcecommunities and industry to do their utmost to bring about attainment asrapidly as possible and expected that a future Congress would change thecourse it had set, if necessary, to avoid any unacceptable consequences.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In sum, REEP and SPP would frustrate the purposes of Part D by abandoningupfront, complete planning for attainment by a near-term fixed deadlinein favor of iterative planning for progress alone. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">(52 FR 26404, 26408 col. 3 (July 14, 1987)). </ITAG>Based on this conclusion, EPA proposed to disapprove several pending ozoneand CO SIPs for extension areas that did not contain persuasive demonstrationsof attainment within such a short-term period, and to impose the constructionmoratorium in those areas. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>52 FR 26431 (July 14, 1987) (reproposal to disapproveCalifornia ozone and CO SIPs for the South Coast and Fresno; reproposalto disapprove California ozone SIPs for Ventura and Sacramento). On November 3, 1987, the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion in <T3>Abramowitz </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>the challenge to EPA's 1984 decision to approve control measuresin the 1982 South Coast SIP and to defer action on the plan as a whole.The court found that EPA had exceeded its authority by approving the SouthCoast control measures without finding whether California had submittedan adequate demonstration of attainment by December 31, 1987, and the Courtordered EPA to take final action to disapprove the relevant SIP provisionsforthwith. 832 F.2d 1071, 1079 (9th Cir. 1987). Pursuant to the court order,EPA took final action to disapprove those SIPs and to lay the groundworkfor imposing the construction ban under section 110(a)(2)(I). 53 FR 1760(January 22, 1988). The ban did not take effect until August 31, 1988,due to the sanctions freeze imposed by the Mitchell-Conte Amendment tothe 1987 Continuing  Resolution  (Pub.  L.  100-202).\8\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The Mitchell-Conte Amendment to the Budget ReconciliationAct of 1987 (Pub.

Formulation of Post-1987 Policy </ITAG>On November 24, 1987, EPA issued a proposed policy on how, after passageof the December 31, 1987 statutory attainment date, states should correcttheir remaining ozone and CO nonattainment problems. 52 FR 45044. The proposalreflected EPA's view at that time of how to apply Part D to state plansafter the statutory dates have passed. The Agency received over 2,000 commentson the proposal, and is still analyzing how those comments should affectEPA's final decisions on post-1987 ozone/CO policy. The Agency has notyet reached any conclusions on issues raised by the commenters. A summaryof relevant sections of the proposed policy is provided below. On its face, Part D (section 172(a)) calls for plans that ``provide forattainment'' of the standard by the stated date (December 31, 1982, orDecember 31, 1987). Because plans developed after 1987 cannot provide forattainment by either of these dates, under the strictest reading of PartD, a state (or EPA) could never develop a plan that meets Part D requirements,and hence could not actually satisfy the applicable requirements. But EPAstated its belief that Congress would have intended EPA in such circumstancesto select, in place of the elapsed dates, a subsequent date consistentwith the general principles of the Act and Part D. <T3>See Chevron, U.S.A.</T3> v. <T3>NRDC</T3>, 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Although it is not clear what subsequent date Congress would have intendedin these circumstances, EPA's post-1987 proposed policy referred to thehistory of the Act's planning requirements and suggested that Congresswould have provided EPA (and these areas) an additional period analogousto the three- and five-year periods set forth in section 110(a)(2)(A) andsection 110(e), respectively. 52 FR 45065. The Agency reasoned that, whenCongress in 1977 directed EPA to initiate a new round of planning for areasthat had failed earlier to produce adequate plans meeting the section 110requirements, it created new planning periods comparable to the section110 periods (three-to-five years from EPA's approval of the State plan),rather than shortening those periods and thereby demanding plans for immediateattainment. Section 172(a)(1) required the SIPs for nonextension areasto provide for attainment by the end of 1982, four years from the datethese submittals were due (January 1, 1979) (<T3>see</T3> section 129(c)). EPA stated in the policy proposal that, to be sure, Congress had provideda much longer attainment period for extension areas_from January 1, 1979to December 31, 1987, approximately nine years from the date the initialPart D SIPs were due. But the Agency then noted that Congress had set uptwo planning periods for these areas_one to apply all ``reasonably available''measures and a second to supplement those measures. Since one might assumethat most reasonably available measures should already have been implementedin areas such as the South Coast by now, EPA stated that post-1987 planningfor the area might be viewed as comparable to the second Part D planningperiod. That period spanned from the July 1982 submittal date (<T3>see</T3> section 129(c)) to the end of 1987, a period roughly consistentwith the three- and five-year periods in section 110. Based on analogy to sections 110 (a) and (e) and the second Part D planningperiod of three to five years, the November 1987 policy proposed that EPAapply the relevant construction moratorium (or leave it in place) in allareas whose new plans do not contain a persuasive showing of attainmentwithin three to five years after EPA action on the plan. Other sanctionswould not follow if the plan indicated reasonable efforts. These reasonableefforts would be reflected in a rate of progress that would bring (at leastpresumptively) an average annual emission reduction of at least 3% of thebase year inventory for the area, not including the reduction from certainbaseline control measures. The post-1987 proposed policy focused on how states should develop SIPsnow that the December 31, 1987 statutory attainment date has passed. Theproposal addressed FIPs only tangentially, and did not contain a detailedevaluation of the statute's FIP provisions. Nor did it describe how EPAmight construct a post-1987 FIP for the South Coast Basin. E. Recent and Current FIP Litigation As the December 31, 1987 attainment date approached, citizens groups beganto seek court action to compel EPA to promulgate FIPs for areas still lackingapproved Part D ozone and CO SIPs. The first such case was a suit by theArizona Center for Law in the Public Interest (ACLPI) to compel the Agencyto impose highway funding sanctions and promulgate CO FIPs for Phoenixand Tucson, two areas whose 1982 Part D CO SIPs had not received EPA approval.In August 1987 the United States District Court for Arizona held that,although EPA was not under a nondiscretionary duty to impose the highwayfunding sanctions, its 1986 disapproval of the CO SIPs for those areashad triggered a duty for the Agency to create FIPs. <T3>McCarthy</T3> v. <T3>Thomas,</T3> slip op. (D. Ariz. 1987). The court then set a schedulefor EPA to produce the FIPs or approve corrective SIPs for the two areas.EPA proposed to promulgate a CO FIP for the Phoenix area on May 16, 1988.53 FR 17378. The proposed FIP would have consisted of two measures that,together with the previously submitted SIP, would produce attainment ofthe CO standard within three years of FIP promulgation. Thus, the proposalwould have applied EPA's views on post-1987 SIP attainment to the FIP forPhoenix. EPA stated that, while the two measures in the proposed FIP couldnot be said to be clearly practicable to implement, their implementation<T3>might</T3> be practicable and hence the Agency could not find groundsto support a two-year extension of the attainment date under section 110(e).Subsequent to the FIP proposal, Arizona supplemented its SIP with new state-adoptedmeasures sufficient in EPA's view to remove the need for a FIP for thePhoenix area. Because the SIP as supplemented would produce attainmentwithin three years of SIP approval, EPA approved it. 53 FR 30220 (August10, 1988). The notice stated, however: <ITAG tagnum="21">Certain important qualifications apply to this analysis. First, EPAis here dealing with a situation in which attainment within 3 years isa practicable possibility given the size of the nonattainment problem andthe measures that the state has submitted. EPA currently has rulemakingand policy proposals outstanding which raise the question of whether EPAmust disapprove a SIP and thereby trigger a construction ban, even wherea state has failed to submit measures that would provide for attainmentwith 3 to 5 years <T3>and</T3> where attainment by means of any measures would be impossibleas a practical matter. See 52 FR 26404 (July 14, 1987) and 52 FR 45044(November 24, 1987). Thus EPA has yet to decide in final form what therole of impossibility is under the Act for the purpose of approval or disapprovalof SIPs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Second, EPA is not deciding in this notice of final action what itsobligations under section 110(c) to promulgate a federal implemention planare. Again, the role of the doctrine of impossibility is uncertain. Further,it is uncertain in any event that EPA must promulgate a FIP that providesfor attainment by a near term fixed date. EPA currently is exploring theseissues in connection with the ozone and CO SIPs for certain areas in Californiaincluding the South Coast Air Quality Management District. EPA does notintend by means of the discussion and analysis in this notice to expressa final view on these issues. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Id.</T3> at 30,227, n.l. Thus, the Arizona rulemaking did not purportto address what section 110(c) requires in relation to an area facing suchsevere nonattainment that attainment within three to five years would destroyits socioeconomic fabric. In early 1988, the Coalition for Clean Air and Sierra Club filed a complaintin the U.S. District Court in California to compel EPA to promulgate aFIP for ozone and CO in the South Coast Air Basin. Following some initialprocedural filings, the court transferred the case from the Northern District(San Francisco) to the Central District (Los Angeles). Just before thattransfer took effect, EPA had filed a response to the plaintiffs' motionon the issue of whether EPA has a duty to promulgate a FIP. EPA's responseacknowledged such a duty, which was affirmed by the court in an order datedSeptember 19, 1988. Today's Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking reflectsEPA's initial efforts to describe and solicit comment on how the Agencycan and should fulfill its obligation.The Agency is involved in similar litigation relating to ozone in othercities. A citizens group, Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, filed suit inthe U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to compelEPA to disapprove the 1982 Ventura County ozone SIP and write an ozoneFIP for that area. EPA published its disapproval of that SIP on October5, 1988. 53 FR 39087. The Sierra Club and the Environmental Council ofSacramento have filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern Districtof California to compel EPA to disapprove the 1982 Sacramento ozone SIPand promulgate a FIP. Finally, the State of Wisconsin has filed suit inthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin to compelEPA to disapprove the 1982 Illinois and Indiana ozone SIPs for the Chicagoarea and to create a FIP. EPA published its disapproval of those SIPs onOctober 17, 1988 (53 FR 40415) and November 18, 1988 (53 FR 46608). Noneof those three courts has ruled on the FIP issues.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. The South Coast Basin: Current Problems and Planning</ITAG>The South Coast Air Basin (Basin) consists of Orange County, and portionsof Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Riverside Counties. The Basin is boundedon the north by the San Gabriel Mountains, on the northeast by the SanBernardino Mountains, and on the east by the San Jacinto Mountains. Lyingoff the semi-permanent high pressure zone of the eastern Pacific Ocean,the region's climate is mild, tempered by cool sea breezes.A. Scope of ProblemAttainment of the NAAQS for ozone and CO is uniquely difficult for theBasin. Despite unprecedented air pollution control accomplishments by oneof the largest and most ambitious local air pollution control programsin the country, the Basin retains its position as the nation's worst ozonenonattainment area and is at or near the top rank of the worst CO nonattainmentareas.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Pollutants</ITAG>The two pollutants of concern in the context of this Notice are ozone andCO. Problems also arise with respect to oxides of nitrogen (NO<T2>x</T2>) and other pollutants.a. <T3>Ozone</T3>. Ozone is a secondary pollutant, formed primarily as a resultof the photochemical reactions between hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen dioxide(NO<T2>2</T2>) in sunlight. Ozone severely irritates the mucous membranesof one's nose and throat, impairs normal functioning of the lungs, andreduces one's ability to perform physical exercise. Individuals with healthrespiratory systems, observed while exercising under closely monitoredacute (1-2 hours) exposure conditions, suffered health effects and reducedphysical capacities in response to even relatively low concentrations ofozone. When ozone levels go higher, chest pains, coughing, wheezing, pulmonaryand nasal congestion, labored breathing, sore throat, nausea, and otherdysfunctions begin to occur.Emissions that react to form ozone come from hundreds of sources, includingmajor stationary sources such as refineries, power generating stations,auto assembly plants; and small stationary sources like dry cleaners, cornergas stations, bakeries, and auto body paint shops. Important sources ofozone precursor emissions include motor vehicles, the burning of fossilfuels generally, and consumer and industrial products such as paints andcleaning solvents.Air quality monitoring data show that of all areas in the country, theBasin has the highest peak ozone concentrations, and experiences the greatestnumber of days with ozone above the ozone NAAQS. To compare and characterizepeak ozone levels, EPA uses an ``air quality design value,'' which is thefourth highest monitored value recorded at a single air quality monitoringstation in the area over the past three years. The 1985-1987 design valuefor the basin is 0.35 parts per million (ppm). This value is nearly threetimes the NAAQS for ozone (0.12 ppm daily maximum one-hour average); thenext highest design value for the same period in another area is Houston's0.20 ppm, or only 60 percent of the Basin's design value. The estimatedannual exceedance of the ozone standard in the Basin for the same periodwas 143 days per year. No other area in the nation exceeded the ozone standardfor more than an average of 35 days per year during that period.b. <T3>Carbon Monoxide</T3>. CO is a colorless, odorless, and poisonous gasproduced by the incomplete burning of carbons in fuels. As much as 95 percentof the CO in the Basin comes from mobile sources, principally motor vehicles.CO binds chemically to hemoglobin, the substance in the blood that carriesoxygen to the cells, and thus reduces the amount of oxygen available tothe body tissues. CO weakens heart contractions, reducing the amount ofblood pumped, and thus the amount of oxygen available to the muscles andorgans. Such oxygen depletion impairs the functioning even of healthy individuals,and can be life threatening to those with heart disease. Exposure to relativelylow concentrations of CO can disrupt mental functions, reduce alertness,and impair vision.The Basin consistently violates the health-based federal air quality standardsfor CO. As a benchmark for comparison, EPA uses the second highest monitoredCO value occurring over an eight-hour period during a year. The Basin'ssecond high peak hour concentrations are approximately twice that of the9 ppm/8-hour CO NAAQS. During 1986, the Basin exceeded this standard on49 days.c. <T3>Other Pollutants.</T3> The Basin is the only area of the country thatviolates the NO<T2>2</T2> NAAQS. Due in large part to the formation of fine particulatefrom secondary aerosols, the Basin also has recorded the highest annualaverage fine particulate matter (PM-10) levels of any major urban area.Reductions in the principal ozone precursors, volatile organic compounds(VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NO<T2>x</T2>), are essential to the attainment of the NAAQS for NO<T2>2</T2> and PM-10. Nitrogen oxides can irritate the lungs, cause bronchitisand pneumonia, lower resistance to respiratory infections such as influenza,and cause pulmonary edema. Particulate matter can irritate or damage therespiratory system, cause acute respiratory illnesses, and increase thenumber and severity of chronic respiratory diseases.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Severity of the South Coast Attainment Shortfall</ITAG>The emissions reductions required to bring the Basin into attainment ofthe ozone NAAQS exceed those needed for other nonattainment areas. TheSouth Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and the Southern CaliforniaAssociation of Governments (SCAG) are now capping a four-year effort todevelop a new South Coast Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP). This planstrives for attainment of the ozone NAAQS in approximately 20 years (by2007) and attainment of the CO NAAQS in approximately 10 years by (1997).The proposed AQMP estimates that attainment of the ozone NAAQS will requirean 80 to 90 percent reduction in VOC emissions along with reductions inNOx emissions.The SCAQMD already strongly controls most of the industrial and commercialactivities which have been identified for regulation across the country.The massive emission reductions that are necessary to close the remainingattainment shortfall must, therefore, come mostly from previously unregulatedsources. These include small industrial, commercial or domestic sourcecategories and mobile source categoies not yet subject to emissions controlrequirements. Further reductions will also require the application of unprecedentedcontrol limits on already regulated existing sources, and the widespreadsubstitution of clean fuels in all source categories.Three additional factors make the task of achieving the NAAQS in the Basineven more formidable. First, the South Coast is the country's largest andmost diverse industrial area, dominated by small companies_pollution sourcesthat are particularly difficult to inventory and regulate. Over the next20 years, the South Coast's enormous projected growth will make it oneof the most populated areas in the United States. Currently, one in 18persons in the U.S. live in the six-county region covered by SCAG. Thisregion includes Ventura and Imperial Counties, as well as the four SouthCoast Air District counties. By the year 2010, one in every 15 personsin the U.S. will live in this area, as the population increases to 18,300,000.By the year 2010, population is projected to increase by 37 percent, employmentby 47 percent, vehicle miles traveled by 68 percent and vehicle trips by72 percent.Second, because of the widely scattered physical locations of jobs, services,entertainment, and housing, and the lack of developed or accepted masstransit alternatives, residents of the South Coast are intensely dependentupon private motor vehicles trips for commuting to work and for accessto essential services and entertainment. SCAG's recent Regional MobilityPlan (February 1988) predicts that today's level of traffic congestionwill progress to gridlock by 2010 and that ``there may not be enough money,land, or time to simply build our way out of the coming congestion'' (p.1). SCAG calculates that, absent significant changes in driving patterns,the average systemwide speed will drop from 35 miles per hour (MPH) to19 MPH during that period, with average morning rush hour speeds droppingfrom 31 MPH to 11 MPH. This congestion will dramatically increase per-vehicleemissions of CO and VOC, since tailpipe emissions of these pollutants arehigher at low speeds and, like running loss VOC emissions,\9\<NOTE/> increase with time on the road.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ So-called ``running losses'' are emissions of VOC releasedfrom points other than the tailpipe or crankcase, while an engine is running.They are distinguished from evaporative emissions, which are those VOClosses that occur when the engine is turned off. Running losses are nearlyall due to evaporation (and in extreme cases, boiling) of fuel from thefuel tank. This is especially apt to occur with high volatility fuels,at high ambient temperatures, and under driving conditions conducive tohigh fuel tank temperatures.Third, the peculiar meteorology and topography of the South Coast makethe area especially susceptible to the formation and persistence of highconcentrations of ozone in the spring, summer, and fall months. The coincidenceof protracted meteorological inversions, light onshore breezes, and highmountains to the east combine to trap air pollutants within the Basin andinhibit normal dispersion for periods of up to several days. Sunlight,a necessary factor in the photochemical reactions that produce ozone, isplentiful year-round; the Basin experiences more days of sunlight thanany other major urban area except Phoenix. The Basin has an additionalgeographical handicap to attainment: high levels of ozone and ozone precursorsare transported into the Basin from the urban areas to the north and, potentially,from the outer continental shelf petroleum development activities to thenorth and west.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Proposed South Coast Air Quality Management Plan </ITAG>The SCAQMD and SCAG publicly issued their proposed AQMP in September 1988.A series of public meetings was convened in July, and will continue untilthe SCAQMD Board and the SCAG Executive Committee adopt the Plan. Oncethe plan is adopted locally, it must be approved by the California AirResources Board (CARB) before submission to the EPA and a SIP revision.The plan addresses all four nonattainment pollutants: ozone, CO, NO<T2>2</T2>, and PM-10.Although the modeling analyses submitted with the draft plan are stillbeing revised, results from preliminary analyses indicate that VOC emissionreductions of 80 to 90 percent would be required to achieve the ozone NAAQS.The SCAQMD estimates that mobile sources account for approximately 50%of the Basin's VOC emissions; industrial and manufacturing account foranother 25%; and commercial, residential, and agricultural activities accountfor the remaining 25%.a. <T3>Outline of South Coast AQMP. </T3>The draft plan outlines the proposeddevelopment and implementation of more stringent controls on currentlyregulated sources; new stationary-source, area-source, transportation,land use, and energy measures; and additional mobile-source controls. Itidentifies schedules for adoption and implementation of the controls bynumerous local, state, and federal agencies, and it presumes new enablinglegislation.Appendices to the plan discuss near-term control measures, including 69specific controls on stationary and area source controls; 19 controls onmotor vehicles; 22 controls on transportation, land use and energy; and13 controls on other mobile sources (such as aircraft, pleasure boats,off-road motorcycles).The draft plan calls for a three-tiered approach to emission reductionsfrom stationary, area, and mobile sources. This approach is based uponestimates of the availability of technology and necessary lead time forthe adoption and implementation of new control measures.Tier I controls cover emissions for which the control technology is assumedavailable today and for which the necessary control measures can be adoptedwithin the next five years. The plan specifies an adoption schedule andan implementing agency for each control measure. Tier I measures include:a revised, very stringent new source review rule applicable to almost everynew or modified source; major NO<T2>x</T2> retrofit controls on refineries, utilities, and industrial boilersand turbines; substitute solvents and coatings and further emissions controlsfor most industrial VOC sources; installation of Best Available RetrofitControl Technology; transit improvements; freeway capacity enhancements;stricter NO<T2>x</T2> standards for light-duty vehicles, heavy-duty diesel trucks,and buses; bus electrification or clean fuel retrofit; truck delivery restrictions;out-of-Basin transport of biodegradable solid waste: emission standardson new pleasure boat engines; and control of emission from such sourcesas aerosol spray deodorants, marine vessels, livestock waste, and residentialgas water heaters.Tier II controls require significant advancement of technology and vigorousregulatory intervention. Research, development, and implementation arescheduled by 2003. The measures include: converting 40 percent of on-roadpassenger vehicles and 50 percent of off-road vehicles to clean fuels (<T3>e.g.,</T3> neat methanol, fuel cells, or electric power); converting70 percent of freight vehicles to methanol; converting all diesel transitbuses to methanol, liquid petroleum gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG)or electricity; maintaining vehicle miles traveled and the number of vehicletrips at current levels through growth management and increased ridesharing;restrictions on driving, licensing, and vehicle registration, if necessary;and reducing 50 percent of the remaining VOC emissions from mobile sources,solvents and coatings, and consumer products.Tier III programs are designed to bring about major technological breakthroughsto further reduce emissions of VOCs and NO<T2>x</T2>. Research, development, and commercialization are scheduledto be completed by 2007. The proposed strategies anticipate almost completeelimination of VOC from solvents and coatings, and a total on-road automobilefleet conversion to electricity. As a contingency, the plan discusses theremoval of high-polluting industry from the Basin. Tier III also relieson the replacement of industrial and commercial combustion units with electricpower generated outside the Basin.The SCAQMD Board is funding a multi-million dollar research and developmentprogram to advance the creation and application of technologies neededfor the Tier II and Tier III control programs.The plan also identifies the need for state and/or federal agencies tolower emissions standards on new jet aircraft engines; to control fugitiveemissions from marine vessel tanks and from outer continental shelf exploration,development, and production; and to limit emissions from pesticide application.b. <T3>Recent Legislation in California.</T3> Recent major legislative enactmentsin California have reinforced the SCAQMD's and ARB's powers to achievesignificant progress in the air quality of the Basin.In the fall of 1987, through the passage of Senate Bill (SB) 151 (Presley)the California State Legislature gave strengthened authority to the SCAQMDfor control of mobile source emissions. SB 151 imposes a state-mandatedlocal program requiring that SCAQMD's rules and regulations provide forindirect source controls and transportation control measures. The Billalso permits the SCAQMD Board to adopt regulations specifying the compositionof motor vehicle fuel for sale in the Basin. In addition, it gives theSCAQMD the authority to prohibit or restrict the operation of heavy-dutyvehicles on freeways and high volume highways during peak commuter travelperiods.\1\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ The SCAQMD has taken the following steps to exercisethis newly acquired authority:<ITAG tagnum="28">a. In January 1988, the SCAQMD approved a $30.6 million clean fuelsdemonstration program that will test cleaner burning fuels for both stationaryand mobile sources. The SCAQMD has already approved $6 million in 1988for such projects as a fuel cells demonstration project, electrificationof curing and drying plants, methanol projects for commercial boilers,new treatments for municipal solid wastes, alternative fuels for mobilesources (electrification, compressed LNG/LPG, methanol), and conversionsand retrofits for buses to methanol. The program is a demonstration ofthe SCAQMD's commitment to a shift from petroleum-based fuels to methanolas a long-term strategy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">b. Regulation XV, a trip-reduction/indirect-source rule, was adoptedby the SCAQMD Board in December 1987. This regulation requires all employersin the South Coast Basin who employ over 100 persons at any worksite topromote employee participation in ridesharing programs. The intent of RegulationXV is to reduce emissions from vehicles used for commuting between homeand the worksite.</ITAG>On September 30, 1988, the Governor of California signed Assembly Bill(AB) 2595 (Sher), ``The California Clean Air Act of 1988.'' AB 2595 furtherstrengthens the authority of local air pollution control districts, suchas the SCAQMD, to enact transportation control measures (TCMs) and regulateindirect sources. It requires these districts, with the cooperation ofthe Councils of Governments, to prepare comprehensive plan revisions toattain the federal and state ambient air quality standards. The Act establishesdifferent requirements for three classes of areas, depending upon the scopeof the nonattainment problem, but all areas are required to achieve atleast a five percent reduction in emissions per year. The most severe nonattainmentareas (those unable to attain by 1997) must include in their plan: (1)Permitting programs to achieve no net increase in permitted emissions;(2) TCMs to achieve an average commute ridership of 1.5 after 1999, andno net increase in vehicle emissions after 1997; (3) measures to achievethe use of a significant number of low-emission motor vehicles by fleetoperators; (4) measures to reduce average per capita ambient exposure tolevels above the standards by 25% by 1994; and by 50% in the year 2000.Finally, AB 2595 requires the ARB to adopt, by the end of 1992, consumerproduct VOC emissions regulations reflecting the maximum technologicallyfeasible control. It also requires the ARB to take, by the beginning of1992, all ``necessary, cost-effective and technologically feasible'' actionsto achieve a 55 percent reduction in VOCs, a 15 percent reduction in NO<T2>x</T2> and the maximum feasible reductions in CO from vehicular andmobile sources by 2000.c. <T3>Current Schedule for Adoption of South Coast AQMP. </T3>The currentschedule for adoption of the proposed South Coast AQMP calls for localadoption hearings by SCAG and the SCAQMD in December 1988, and for adoptionby ARB in the spring of 1989. If ARB adopts the plan, ARB would submitit to EPA for approval as a SIP revision soon afterward. The AQMP includesdetailed schedules for later adoption by the various responsible jurisdictionsof individual measures in the plan.If this draft plan is submitted to EPA as a SIP revision, it would precedeby at least two years the national submittal deadline for post-1987 SIPssuggested by EPA's post-1987 ozone/CO policy proposal. That proposal wouldrequire a plan to contain state and local control measures that providean annual reduction in emissions of at least three percent per year beyonda baseline of measures previously required or promulgated by EPA. The SouthCoast SIP would appear to be more stringent than this minimum ``reasonableefforts'' progress requirement in the proposed policy, provided the SCAQMDand the relevant governments supplement the plan framework with regulationssufficient to produce the projected emissions reductions.EPA's preliminary review of the South Coast plan suggests that such a planas the South Coast has developed, if adopted and implemented on schedule,would provide for: (1) The near-term application of currently availabletechnologies; (2) an ambitious commitment to the development and widespreadapplication of future technologies; (3) an aggressive program for the implementationof transportation control measures; and (4) useful proposals for new sourcereview and indirect source review.On the other hand, optimism over this plan must be tempered by realism.The plan provides for marginal attainment throughout the Basin, even thoughit evinces a readiness to adopt harsh measures. At this point, moreover,the South Coast plan must still be regarded as a blueprint for attainment.Much remains to be done before it will embody enforceable measures, andbefore its hoped-for emissions reductions can be counted upon. Moreover,because the plan is so ambitious_it mandates sweeping changes in establishedindustries_its impact on social and economic life in the Basin will beprofound, and may stand in the way of its thorough implementation.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. What Attainment Deadline Governs Post-1987 FIPs?</ITAG>EPA's current dilemma arises from the Clean Air Act's failure to be explicitabout the deadline by which a federal implementation plan for the SouthCoast_or for any area still subject to Part D of the Act_must show attainmentof the ozone standard mow that the Decemberr 31, 1987 attainment date inPart D has passed.\11\<NOTE/> To address the problem, we must first review the applicableprinciples of statutory construction.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ The impetus for this discussion is the FIP obligationEPA faces in the South Coast, an area that does not yet have an EPA-approvedPart D SIP. Most of the principles EPA describes however, logically applyalso to areas with approved Part D SIPS that failed to produce attainmentby the end of 1987.A. Principles of Statutory InterpretationThe Supreme Court recently outlined these principles in <T3>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council, </T3>467 U.S. 837 (1984). The firstquestion to ask is whether Congress:<ITAG tagnum="20">has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intentof Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, aswell as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intentof Congress.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Id. </T3>at 843. If there is no statutory language that directly speaksto the issue, then we must look beyond the immediate language to the statuteas a whole, and to the legislative history. Should we find expressed aspecific Congressional intention, our search is at an end. If, however,Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue_``ifthe statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue''_thenwe must proceed to construe the statute in accordance with its language,history, and purposes. Id. at 843-845, to 865.When the plain meaning of the language of a statute is sufficient to determinethe purpose of legislation, courts generally follow it. <T3>See United States </T3>v. <T3>American Trucking Association, </T3>310 U.S. 534, 543 (1940). But courtsalso have been willing to look beyond the plain language of the statuteto divine Congressional intent.<ITAG tagnum="21">When that meaning has led to absurd or futile results, * * * thisCourt has looked beyond the words to the purpose of the Act. Frequently,however, even when the plain meaning did not produce absurd results butmerely an unreasonable one ``plainly at variance with the policy of thelegislation as a whole,'' this Court has followed that purpose rather thanthe literal words.</ITAG><T3>Id. </T3>at 543 (footnote omitted). <T3>See also TVA </T3>v. <T3>Hill, </T3>437 U.S. 153, 184 n. 29 (1978). Conversely, when the legislativehistory, combined with the plain language, supports seemingly harsh orabsurd results, courts are unwilling to reconstrue statutes. <T3>Griffin </T3>v. <T3>Oceanic Contractors, Inc., </T3>458 U.S. 564, 575 (1978) (citing <T3>Crooks </T3>v. <T3>Harrelson, </T3>282 U.S. 55, 60 (1930)). <T3>See also Commissioner of Internal Revenue </T3>v. <T3>Asphalt Products Co., Inc., </T3>107 S. Ct. 2275, 2278 (1987).Beyond that, several courts have examined EPA's failure to perform a statutoryduty, such as issuing regulations or guidelines within a statutory period,in light of the Agency's argument that compliance with the deadline wasinfeasible or impossible. See, e.g., <T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>Train, </T3>510 F.2d 692, 712-13 (D.C. Cir. 1975); <T3>Sierra Club </T3>v. <T3>Thomas, </T3>658 F. Supp. 165, 170-173 (N.D.

When theagency can establish impossibility by demonstrating manpower, methodologicalor budgetary constraints, courts will not force the Agency ``to do an impossibility.''<T3>Sierra Club, </T3>602 F. Supp. at 899 (citing <T3>Maggio </T3>v. <T3>Zeitz, </T3>333 U.S. 56 (1948)).Along the same lines, courts also disfavor statutory constructions thatinfer broad agency powers to effect radical economic and social change.In determining not to interpret section 112 of the Clean Air Act to requireEPA to set a zero-emissions standard for hazardous air pollutants, theUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, <T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>824 F.2d 1146, 1154 (D.C.

The Starting Point: The Search for a Specific Congressional IntentAs stated earlier, the first step in our analysis is to see whether thestatutory language or the legislative history reveals a specific congressionalintent as to what attainment date applies to a post-1987 FIP for an arealike the South Coast. The leading statutory provision is section 110(c)(1).It defines not only the conditions that trigger EPA's duty to promulgatea FIP, but also the elements a FIP must include. It goes only so far asto indicate, however, that a FIP must satisfy ``the requirements of thissection,'' that is, section 110. First, EPA must promulgate a FIP for astate when a state fails to submit a SIP that ``meets the requirementsof [section 110].'' Moreover, the only escape from this obligation is if,prior to promulgation, the ``state has adopted and submitted a plan (orrevision) which the Administrator determines to be in accordance with therequirements of this section.'' Section 110(d) corroborates this generalguidance: it states that an ``applicable implementation plan'' is one ``whichhas been approved under subsection [110](a) or promulgated under subsection(c) and which implements the requirements of this section.'' Thus, it appearsthat Congress intended a FIP to be a complete substitute for an approvableSIP, or to form, together with a SIP that is not fully adequate by itself,a plan that is fully approvable under section 110.Section 110, in turn, impliedly incorporates for nonattainment areas therequirements of Part D. It does so by its reference in section 110(a)(2)(A)to the construction ban in section 110(a)(2)(I) and by that section's referenceto Part D. <T3>See also </T3>section 172(b)(1), 42 U.S.C. 7502(b)(1) (express recognitionthat the plan for a nonattainment area might be promulgated by EPA). Thusit appears that Congress intended an FIP for a nonattainment area to complywith the requirements of Part D. But when it comes to determining the appropriate date for a SIP or a FIPto show attainment, the last date specified in either section 110 or PartD is December 31, 1987. If the parenthetical reference in section 172(b)(1)to a plan ``promulgated by the Administrator'' incorporates the dates insection 172(a), and if EPA had been compelled to create a Part D FIP fora nonattainment area in, say, 1983, then EPA would have been required toissue an FIP providing for attainment by the end of 1987. This date isnow past, however, and it is impossible for areas without Part D SIP approvalto meet it. Moreover, the statute contains no explicit instructions asto what attainment date applies to FIPs adopted after 1987. Thus, the languageitself does not reveal a specific congressional intent as to what the attainmentdate for post-1987 FIPs should be. We must therefore look to the legislativehistory to discover whether Congress had such an intent. The history contains very little direct discussion of the attainment daterequirements for FIPs. Senator Muskie, one of the sponsors of the 1977Clean Air Act Amendments, spoke of FIP deadlines, but failed to make clearin his remarks whether FIPs were intended to adhere to the December 1987final date. Senator Muskie stated: <ITAG tagnum="21">[1982 Extension SIPs] must provide for attainment as expeditiouslyas practicable, but not later than the firm deadline of December 31, 1987.Where States do not submit adequate plans, the Administrator must promulgatehis own plan insuring attainment by <T3>firm deadlines</T3>.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">123 Cong. Rec. 26,847 col. 1 (August 9, 1977) (statement of Sen. Muskie),<T3>reprinted in </T3> 3 Leg. Hist. 355. (emphasis added). The Senatorfurther remarked that ``the Administrator will be required to promulgateplan revisions insuring NAAQS attainment by the <T3>appropriate deadlines</T3> where a State's plan is inadequate.'' 123Cong. Rec. 26,847 col. 2 (August 4, 1977) (Statement of Sen. Muskie), <T3>reprinted in </T3> 3 Leg. Hist. 356. Senator Muskie's omission of anyreference to the date by which an FIP must assure attainment, coupled withhis identification of the date by which an SIP must assure attainment,means that it is simply unclear whether he intended the FIP attainmentschedule to track, or to vary from, the SIP attainment schedule. Further,there is absolutely no discussion of what constitutes a ``firm'' or ``appropriate''SIP or FIP deadline after 1987. Thus we must look elsewhere in the historyto divine whether Congress had a specific intent with respect to post-1987FIP deadlines. The history reveals that Congress intended 1987 to be a firm deadline,and that Congress believed it would provide legislative relief if thatdate proved impossible for some areas to meet. First, there is evidence that Congress anticipated that it would be impossiblefor some areas of the country to attain the standards by 1982, and, forsome, even by 1987.

Rec. 18,038 col. 3 (June 8, 1977) (statement of Sen. Stafford),<T3>reprinted in </T3>3 Leg. Hist. 771. It is apparent from these passages that Congress understood that some areaswould find attainment by the end of 1987 impossible, and that Congress,arguably, did not intend to force the development of plans that would resultin attainment in those areas by the end of 1987.\12\<NOTE/> Nevertheless, Congress also wanted to force as much air qualityimprovement as possible. As a result, it adopted a strategy of (1) commandingthe creation of legal structures that, through tight deadlines and thethreat of enforcement, would pressure polluters and local governments todo their utmost, and (2) expressly recognizing that a subsequent Congressmight provide relief. Indeed, all explicit references in the legislativehistory to the prospect of relief from the 1987 deadlines are to reliefprovided by <T3>Congress.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ A further indication that Congress may have intendedthe requirement for attainment by 1987 to be more in the nature of an incentive(or threat) to induce the greatest effort possible may be inferred fromthe fact that the legislative history includes almost no discussion ofwhat types of measures the 1982 extension SIPs were to include to assureattainment by 1987. For example, the Senate Report included a lengthy discussionof the types of measures to be included in the 1979 SIPs, but stated onlythat the 1982 extension SIPs must ``contain [] the enforceable measuresneeded to achieve the standard by 1987.'' S. Rep. No. 95-127, 95th Cong.,1st Sess. at 39 (1977), <T3>reprinted in </T3>3 Leg. Hist. at 1413. Here, however, 1987 has come and gone, and Congress has provided no suchrelief. While the history reveals an intent that only Congress providerelief from the 1987 attainment date, it reveals absolutely no specificintent as to what should happen if Congress failed to provide such relief(or new direction) by the time EPA was faced with having to create a post-1987FIP. Since neither the language nor the legislative history reveals a specificintent as to post-1987 FIP attainment dates in these circumstances, thestatute contains a gap that, under <T3>Chevron, </T3>the Agency may fill by reaching a reasonable accommodationwith other aspects of the Act's language, history, purposes, and structure.\13\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Here, this task is not an easy one, since, as the Courtnoted in <T3>Chevron, </T3>``the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 are a lengthy,detailed, technical, complex and comprehensive response to a major socialissue.'' 467 U.S. at 850. As the Supreme Court has recognized, the statuterepresents Congress' effort to a reconcile competing interests. <T3>Id. </T3>at 863. C. EPA's Chevron Analysis: Description of the Act'sBasic Themes Some portions of the Act's language are useful to our analysis under <T3>Chevron </T3>of how best to fill the attainment date gap in the statute.For example, the requirement that plans ``provide for attainment'' (sections172 (a) and (c) and 110(a)(2)(A)) makes it clear that a post-1987 FIP musthave some fixed attainment date. The Agency concluded as much when it rejectedthe REEP concept in the July 14, 1987 <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Other language suggests that the post-1987 FIP attainment date should notbe so stringent as to end all significant economic activity in an area.For example, section 110(a)(2) of the Act appears to contemplate that pollutioncontrols would be consistent with significant continuing economic activity.Section 110(a)(2) calls for ``emission <T3>limitations'' </T3>and ``transportation controls'' (section 110(a)(2)(B));``<T3>regulation </T3>of the modification, construction, and operation ofany stationary source'' (section 110(a)(2)(D)); ``requirements for installationof equipment by owners or operators of stationary sources to monitor emissionsfrom such sources'' (section 110(a)(2)(F)); and ``periodic inspection andtesting of motor vehicles to enforce compliance with applicable emissionstandards'' (section 110(a)(2)(G)) (emphasis added). Moreover, sections172(b)(6) and 173 contain requirements for allowing new sources to constructin nonattainment areas. These requirements by their terms contemplate ongoingsocio-economic activity consistent with reasonable and acceptable programsto meet the goals of the law. Finally, the residual requirement that all plans provide for attainment``as expeditiously as practicable'' (sections 172(a) and 110(a)(2)(A)),if read in isolation, suggests that if the Act contains no uniform nationwideattainment date EPA might consider choosing a FIP attainment date suitableto the practicalities of attainment in each particular area_even if forsome areas that date were to extend far into the future. The Act's structure and the history of how Congress has addressed similarin the past suggest that fairly short attainment periods would be mostconsistent with the goals of the statute. First, the structure of Section110 and Part D is biased toward creation of plans to attain within relativelyshort periods of three to ten years. On the previous occasion when Congresswas able to address the problem, it did not require immediate attainment,or even shorten subsequent planning periods. Instead, in 1977, when Congressordered a new round of planning for areas that had failed to meet section110 deadlines, it extended planning deadlines for periods comparable toprevious section 110 periods. Moreover, the structure of the Act's planningprovisions and the history reveal that Congress was interested more inensuring the creation of <T3>plans </T3>for attainment by dates in the future than with forcingimmediate shutdowns and curtailments of driving. The legislative history ``plainly identifies the policy concerns that motivated''enactment of the statute. 467 U.S. at 863. Congress, in its considerationof the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, struggled to reconcile the goalof clean air with that of continued economic development.\14\<NOTE/> Congress sought to improve air quality, and to impose toughmeasures to do so, but also tried to minimize economic disruption, andforesaw that the target dates it set might prove too difficult for allto meet. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ Representative Waxman stated: <ITAG tagnum="28">We have struck a proper balance between environmental controls andeconomic growth in the dirty air areas of America. . . .

But during a colloquy in the Senate on a provision to exempt from highwayand air planning funding sanctions those areas making reasonable efforts,three Senators suggested that some states might avoid such dislocationand disruption by planning for attainment in the long term. Senator Stevensquestioned Senator Gravel about an area such as Fairbanks, Alaska, whichhas a naturally-caused problem with CO that is aggravated by ice and fogand CO emissions from cars. Senator Gravel reassured Senator Stevens thateven if the problem could not be solved ``by the year 2000, we still willnot get hurt.''<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Mr. Stevens: </T3>This means that the State of Alaska will not losethose funds if we cannot solve the ice-fog problem?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Mr. Gravel: </T3>If that happens, I will come to the floor of the Senateand slash my wrists * * *.</ITAG>Senator Muskie stated that it was ``reasonable'' to retain ``some sanctionsfor those jurisdictions which make no effort * * * to put together implementationplans * * *.'' 123 Cong.

Rec. 18020 col. 1 (June 8, 1977) (statement of Sen. Muskie)<T3>reprinted in </T3>3 Leg. Hist. 721. Thus, two clear strands of legislativepurpose are Congress' desire to avoid imposition of draconian measuresand to intrude as little as possible upon State and local initiatives.From this review of the Act's language, structure, history, and purposes,we can identify several themes, not all of which are consistent with oneanother. We see a desire for fixed deadlines limited to a decade or less,yet not so short as to cause the cessation of economic activity and growthin any area. We see a desire to attain the standards through practicablemeans,, but an acceptance (perhaps even desire) for a certain amount oftechnology forcing. Finally, the Alaska colloquy reveals little recognitionthat in severe nonattainment areas EPA would actually impose draconianmeasures.A review of these themes yields three possible answers to the FIP deadlinequestion, each of which offers a different means of reconciling ``manifestlycompeting interests.'' 467 U.S. at 865-66. These alternative solutionsare: (1) Immediate attainment; (2) attainment within five years; (3) attainmentin a longer term, but as expeditiously as practicable without causing severeeconomic and social disruption. In the next section, we will discuss eachof these alternatives in turn, summarizing the legal and equitable argumentsfor and against each. In doing so, we will also describe the type of FIPeach of the interpretations would impose.Selecting an interpretation that would prescribe a post-1987 attainmentdeadline for the South Coast has profound implications. The South Coastauthorities estimate that an 80-90 per cent reduction in VOC emissionsis necessary to attain the ozone standard. Consequently, any FIP for thearea would need to eliminate or severely limit practically every humanactivity that produces VOC emissions. Since a significant portion of theBasin's ozone problem, and almost all of its CO problem, is due to mobilesources, a plan aimed at attaining these standards in five years wouldhave to ban the sale or use of fossil fuels for cars and trucks, airplanes,boats, and trains. To achieve the necessary emission reductions, and stillallow the minimum essential vehicles_<T3>e.g., </T3>police cars, emergency response vehicles, and delivery trucksof food and medical supplies_a short-term FIP would have to prohibit entirelythe use of all non-essential pollutant-emitting vehicles, since even vehiclesburning relatively clean fuels, such as methanol, could still cause continuednonattainment.Thus, under a short-term attainment FIP, people would be forbidden to operateany private vehicle that was not ``emission-free''; only vehicles suchas bicycles or electric cars would be permitted. The development, on amass scale, of clean vehicles for private use, or of mass transit alternativesthat do not burn gasoline or diesel fuel, could not take place within fiveyears. Nor would there be any realistic opportunity to establish cleantransportation substitutes for aircraft, locomotives, marine vessels, andheavy-duty diesel trucks. If a short-term FIP were enforced, it would beimpossible for most people to commute to work, and for most forms of commerceto continue.As noted above, industrial and manufacturing facilities contribute aboutone quarter of the Basin's VOC emissions; consumer products and relatedservices account for another quarter. A short-term FIP would necessarilyprohibit almost all VOC emissions from manufacturing activities, and banall products with VOC emissions_for example paints, waxes, pesticides,auto antifreeze, cleaning products, lubricants, and suntan lotions. Theban would extend to the manufacture, sale, and use of any reactive hydrocarbon-basedsolvent, coating or solution.A short-term FIP would also prohibit refining, storage, transportationand combustion of fossil fuel. Southern California is the largest petroleumrefining and distribution area on the West Coast. Federally required shutdownsof the petroleum refining and trans-shipping operations in the South Coastwould have severe effects not only in the Basin, but in other areas aswell.Other major industries in the Basin_for example, auto asembly plants, furnituremanufacturing plants, printing plants, aerospace plants, semi-conductorplants and electronics plants_would be forced to discontinue or drasticallycurtail operations.A more detailed description of the elements and probable effects of a five-yearFIP is contained in Appendix A. But it is evident that a short-term FIPwould have catastrophic consequences. Only a FIP that forced emission reductionsgradually over a fairly long period could temper those consequences byallowing economic and societal adjustments.D. Analysis of Three Ways to Fill the Statute's Gap<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Interpretation 1: Immediate Attainment</ITAG>This interpretation is premised on the fact that the last deadline specifiedin the statute is now past, and nothing in the statute provides explicitauthority for EPA to extend it. Since it is impossible for EPA, as wellas any state, to fashion a plan that would produce attainment by this deadline,arguably EPA must do the next best thing, and prepare a plan demonstratingimmediate attainment (e.g., within 30 days of publication of the FIP in<T4>Federal Register</T4>).In the past, in a similar situation involving the Federal Water PollutionControl Act (FWPCA), EPA concluded that immediate compliance with lapseddeadlines is required. The FWPCA authorized EPA to issue permits requiringdischargers to achieve effluent limits based on the ``best practicablecontrol technology currently available'' (BPT) by July 1, 1977. But EPAwas unable to issue implementing guidelines or permits in time. Thus, inspite of good faith efforts, some companies found it impossible to meetthis deadline, and petitioned in court for EPA to grant extensions. Uponexamination of the legislative history, the United States Court of Appealsfor the Third Circuit found that the deadline ``was intended by Congressto be a rigid guidepost'' and ``an inflexible target.'' <T3>Bethlehem Steel Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Train, </T3>544 F.2d 657, 661 (3rd Cir. 1976) [citing portions of legislativehistory]. Thus the court concluded that Congress did not authorize EPAto deviate from the deadlines. The court stated that:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Union Electric Company </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>[427 U.S. 246 (1976)], appears to indicate that the SupremeCourt is willing to construe environmental statutes in a manner that mayimpose major burdens on polluters, and if the plain language of the applicablelegislation so indicates, relief from such hardships must flow from Congress.</ITAG>Indeed, in 1976, on the previous occasion that EPA was required to preparea FIP for Los Angeles, EPA and the Ninth Circuit regarded the statutorydeadline then applicable_May 1977_as absolute. The court upheld gas rationingregulations in a FIP aimed at meeting the deadline prescribed in the statute,observing that the Clean Air Act has permitted postponement of the initial1975 attainment deadline until 1977, if there was no reasonably availablealternative. But the court noted that:<ITAG tagnum="21">There is no comparable language contained in the requirements fordevelopment of the alternative plan after the extension has been granted.Thus, while Congress indicated its desire to take social and economic factorsinto consideration when granting extensions, the lack of comparable languageelsewhere indicates that those factors would not affect the implementationof the only plan available to meet the standards. <T3>South Terminal Corp. </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>504 F.2d 646, 675-76 (1st Cir. 1974).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>City of Santa Rosa </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>534 F.2d at 150, 154. The court expressed its concern withthe effects of its ruling, but concluded that only Congress could cometo the rescue:<ITAG tagnum="21">The situation in which petitioners find themselves is not an enviableone.

We sympathizebut we have no authority to alter the regulation.

That moment may well have arrived, but we cannot provide the desiredescape.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><T3>Public Citizen </T3>v. <T3>Young, </T3>831 F.2d at 1122.The argument in support of Interpretation 1_requiring immediate attainmentof the ozone and carbon monoxide standards_is that Congress set firm, fixedstatutory deadlines for SIPs and FIPs, and that, as the Court found inthe <T3>Santa Rosa </T3>and FWPCA cases, Congress intended to be the sole dispenserof relief from these deadlines.On the other side of the ledger, calling for immediate attainment is inconsistentwith past Congressional reaction when deadlines under the Clean Air Actwere missed. As stated earlier, Congress' reaction in 1977 to the failuresof 1970-77 was to create new planning periods, not to demand immediateattainment.Furthermore, the situation we confront here is different from what theNinth Circuit encountered in 1976 when it decided the <T3>Santa Rosa </T3>case and the Third Circuit encountered in <T3>Bethlehem Steel. </T3>First, unlike those cases, the statutory deadlinehas passed. And second, we are not writing on a blank slate. We now knowthat when Congress <T3>did </T3>consider the problem of the statutory deadlines in 1977, itdid <T3>not </T3>require immediate attainment.Another argument against requiring immediate attainment is that it is inconsistentwith a key element in the legislative history_the statements evincing aconcern with avoiding serious economic disruption.\1\\6\<NOTE/> Indeed, when Congress discussed the amount of economic hardshipit expected to result from the Act, it appears that it did not want toimpose harsh measures on those areas making reasonable efforts to improveair quality. For instance, Senators Muskie, Stevens, and Gravel, in theircolloquy concerning Fairbanks, Alaska, took the position that, as longas an area made reasonable efforts, even if it could not attain ``by theyear 2000'', a construction ban would be imposed, but otherwise, that area``will not get hurt''. 123 Cong. Rec. 18476. (June 10, 1977) (statementsof Sens. Gravel, Stevens, Muskie), <T3>reprinted in </T3>3 Leg. Hist. 1063. But, as explained below, the requirementof immediate attainment would, if enforced, to a cataclysmic event forLos Angeles, and far harsher than anything Muskie and the Alaska Senatorsseem to have anticipated or desired for any area under Part D.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ For example, Senator Muskie pointed out that:<ITAG tagnum="28">The advantage of the two-tiered approach, with a possible 10-yearextension for attainment, is to provide a longer time frame to plan forand phase in necessary controls so as to minimize disruption.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">123 </ITAG><T3>Cong.

Stafford),<T3>reprinted in </T3>3 Leg. Hist. 770.One could find further arguments against the immediate attainment optionby analogizing to the judicial doctrines avoiding absurd results, impossibilities,and conflicts between statutory provisions. As set forth earlier, evenwhere the meaning of a statute is plain (and here, as shown above, it isnot), if applying that meaning would lead to ``absurd or futile results'',a court may look ``beyond the words to the purpose of the Act'', and followthat purpose rather than the literal words, unless the legislative historyshows that Congress intended such results. <T3>United States v. American Trucking Association, </T3>310 U.S. at 543.<T3>See also TVA v. Hill, </T3>437 U.S. at 184 n. 29, Similarly, the courtsseek to avoid an interpretation that will result in a practical impossibility.<T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>824 F.2d at 1154. Here, where Congress does not appear tohave provided plainly and intentionally that FIPs produce immediate attainment,the case is even stronger for trying to avoid this outcome, and reachinga more reasonable accommodation among the conflicting statutory purposes.A FIP whose goal was instant attainment would have to prohibit immediatelyoperation in the Basin of nearly every fossil-fueled vehicle, prohibitalmost all industrial and commercial VOC emissions, curtail drasticallymost agricultural activities producing VOC emissions, and ban many consumerproducts containing reactive solvents. Such a plan would shut down majorbusiness activity, halt traffic, and dramatically restrict all aspectsof social and economic life. Implementing and enforcing such drastic measuresmay well be impossible, and could prevent satisfaction of the basic necessitiesof life_including food, shelter, and medical services.Enforcement of the FIP measures would begin upon the effective date ofthe FIP promulgation, usually 30 days following publication of the rulein the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> The disruptive consequences and enforcementdifficulties of immediate FIP prohibitions would be more extreme than FIPmeasures that could be phased in over a number of years. There would beno opportunity to transform or relocate industrial and commercial operations,or to identify and develop any alternatives to the existing transportationsystems. Even the development of effective emergency systems to providenecessary services and commodities to Basin residents might be preemptedby a FIP that required instant attainment. Consequently, the residentsof the area would face the destruction of daily life as they know it, andthe likely prospect of mass evacuation.\1\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ For similar reasons, EPA recently rejected immediateattainment as a criterion for measuring the SIP for carbon monoxide inMaricopa County, Arizona. In its final notice, EPA stated that the Actdoes not require SIPs to provide for attainment more quickly than the generalformulation in section 172(a)(2) (``as expeditiously as practicable''),provided that the three-to-five-years criterion that the Agency was applyingat the time was satisfied.<ITAG tagnum="28">53 FR 30,233 (August 10, 1988). EPA stated:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">If EPA were to adopt [the] position that post-1987 planning shouldprovide for attainment at the soonest time, many post-1987 non-attainmentareas would have to resort to draconian measures with drastic social andeconomic impacts_such as plant closings, gasoline rationing and mandatoryno-drive restrictions_simply because such measures are physically availableto bring about attainment. EPA does not believe that Congress, if it hadaddressed the post-1987 non-attainment situation now being faced, wouldhave required such a result, even after passage of the Part D dates. EPAbelieves that Congress would instead have regarded the ``as expeditiouslyas practicable'' requirement to be still in place, albeit bounded in situations,such as that of Maricopa County, by fixed attainment deadlines.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><T3>Id. </T3>at 30,233. <T3>See also American Lung Association </T3>v. <T3>Kean, </T3>18 Envt. L. Rptr. 20317 (D. N.J. 1987).Another difficulty with a plan calling for immediate attainment is thatit may conflict with other statutory requirements concerning enforcement.A literal interpretation of section 110(c)(1) would require, through section110(a)(2)(D), that the FIP include ``a program to provide for the enforcementof emissions limitations * * * as necessary to assure that [the NAAQS]are achieved and maintained.'' In addition, section 172(c), which appliesto extension areas, like the South Coast, would require an SIP submittedin 1982 to ``contain enforceable measures to assure attainment'' by theend of 1987. By extrapolation, the requirements of section 172(c) couldalso be read to apply to a FIP promulgated after 1987. One of the requirementsof section 110(a), applicable to SIPs, is that a plan must provide:<ITAG tagnum="21">Necessary assurances that the State will have adequate personnel,funding, and authority to carry out such implementation plan.</ITAG>Section 110(a)(2)(F)(i), 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(F)(i); 172(b)(7), 42 U.S.C.7502(b)(7). When EPA prepares an FIP, arguably it also must comply withthis section, and demonstrate that it, rather than the state, possessesmeans adequate to carry out the plan.But enforcing a federal plan calling for immediate attainment would behighly problematic. Implementation of such a plan would call for massiveand intrusive enforcement efforts_to halt traffic, shut down businessesand schools, and restrict gasoline_and could well require resources beyondthose available to EPA. Although the federal government as a whole mightbe able to call on the National Guard, state and local police, FBI, andcontractors, these enforcement efforts may require resources beyond whatthe federal government can muster, given its other responsibilities. Thus,although it may be possible to draft on paper a plan requiring immediateattainment, EPA may not be able to comply with section 110(a)(2)(F)(i)'smandate that EPA provide assurances that it can carry out such a plan.Arguably, EPA should avoid construing the FIP deadline term of the statutein a way that brings it into conflict with these enforceability requirements.<T3>Citizens to Save Spencer County v. EPA,</T3> 600 F.2d at 844.EPA's experience in Los Angeles in the 1970's when it attempted to imposean FIP containing gasoline rationing and other drastic control measures,dramatically illustrates the folly of enacting regulations that are virtuallyunenforceable. (See section II. D. 2, <T3>infra</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Interpretation 2: Attainment in Three to Five Years</ITAG>In EPA's November 24, 1987, ozone policy proposal, the Agency proposedan option other than immediate attainment. The Agency proposed the viewthat Congress intended EPA, in formulating FIPs for areas without approvedPart D plans, to provide, not necessarily for immediate attainment, butinstead for attainment as expeditiously as practicable within three tofive years. As noted above, section 110(c) specifies that an FIP must meetthe requirements of section 110. That section, in turn, contains the fundamentalrequirement that SIPs provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable,but within three to five years after approval. <T3>See</T3> section 110(a)(2)(A) and (E), 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(A) and(E). Section 110 also implicitly contains the 1987 attainment deadlinein Part D, but that deadline is arguably now a nullity by virtue of itspassage, and the only remaining guidance in section 110 is the three tofive year boundary. Since Congress intended that boundary to govern originalSIPs and arguably also SIP revisions in response to findings of inadequacyunder section 110(a)(2)(H), it arguably would have wanted the same boundaryto govern post-1987 SIPs, absent operative language to the contrary. Indeed,the basic pattern of Congressional behavior has been to allow attainmentdate extensions on the order of five years.As noted above, when Congress enacted the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments,it allowed in Part D two additional planning periods for extension areas_thefirst period, about four years, to apply all ``reasonable available'' measures,and the second, roughly three to five years, to supplement those measures.Since enough time has elapsed for the South Coast already to have adoptedall ``reasonable available'' measures, an analogy to the second Part Dplanning period appears most appropriate to the current situation. Followingthis reasoning, Congress arguably would have intended post-1987 FIPs toattain in three to five years.\18\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ EPA can only venture its best judgment as to what Congresswould have us do now. Setting and changing deadlines in the Act is a functionreserved for Congress.The strengths of this approach are that: (1) It is grounded in the languageof the statute and in a close analogy to the periods specified in bothsection 110(a) and Part D; (2) as we have noted above, it adopts an approachsomewhat akin to the approach Congress took in 1977 when attainment deadlineswere missed; and (3) it conforms to the elements of the legislative historyindicating Congress intended firm, near-term planning deadlines that forcedsome changes in technology and lifestyle.If these factors were sufficient to amount to a ``clear'' Congressionalintent that EPA create new three to five year planning periods, that wouldbe the end of the matter. <T3>Chevron, </T3>467 U.S. at 843. The Agency doubts, however, that thatis the case. The statute is ambiguous, and the evidence in the legislativehistory is, at best, conflicting. If EPA adopted this Interpretation, ratherthan Interpretation 1, it would be assuming authority to extend the 1987statutory deadline. As we noted above, Congress in the 1977 Amendmentsappeared to anticipate the need to provide relief from some of the laterdeadlines in the Act_and to reserve to itself the power to dispense suchrelief. But the legislative history also shows that Congress thought itwould confront this issue <T3>before </T3>the deadlines had passed_not after. For example SenatorDominici stated, after describing the two-stage procedure in Part D (whichcalls for submission of a plan in 1979, followed by a subsequent submission,if necessary, in 1982):<ITAG tagnum="21">I clearly understand that the result of the five-year part [1982 planto attain in 1987] may bring back issues to us in terms of attainment.But I believe this will give the opportunity for growth, yet assure thatwe are pushing with a maximum clean-up during that interim, <T3>and previous to the expiration of the five years, only Congress couldmake some judgment as to the next goal.</T3></ITAG>Transcript, Mark-Up, Clean Air Act Amendments at 15 (May 3, 1977), (emphasisadded).In addition, there is some evidence, as discussed above in connection withimmediate attainment, that Congress did not anticipate and therefore didnot intend to stimulate plans that would have catastrophic consequencesif put into effect. As explained above and in Appendix A to this notice,a three-to-five-year FIP for the South Coast would be nearly as draconianas an immediate FIP, given the extent of the pollution problem.Thus, one can raise two quite different objections to the five-year FIPinterpretation. The first objection is based on the elements in the legislativehistory indicating Congress' intent to be the sole authority for extensionof deadlines. This objection argues in favor of the immediate attainmentinterpretation, since it is premised on a lack of EPA power to extend thedeadline beyond the immediate attainment. The second objection, on theother hand, reads the relevant case law and history to confer upon EPAsome power to adopt a new attainment date, but holds that the consequencesof promulgating a five-year FIP are_as they were for immediate attainment_soharsh that Congress could not have intended them.As we noted in our discussion of an immediate attainment FIP, even wherestatutory language is plain, courts avoid constructions that lead to absurdor radically unreasonable results. There is even more reason to steer clearof such intolerable consequences when, as here, the statute itself doesnot command them and where a major theme of the legislative history isminimization of economic and social disruption.In terms of its destructive force on the economy of the South Coast, thereis little to distinguish a five-year FIP from one requiring immediate attainment.Such a plan must include restrictions and prohibitions that effectivelyprevent from operating within the Basin, in the fifth year, almost allfossil fuel-powered vehicles; eliminate almost all aircraft and marinevessels from the Basin; prohibit almost every industrial source from emittingany VOCs; dramatically reduce VOC emissions from commercial and residentialsolvents and fuel combustion; and substantially limit agricultural VOCemissions.\1\\9\<NOTE/> A five-year FIP would impose requirements so draconian asto remake life in the South Coast Basin. Under a five-year FIP, the populationwould effectively face a choice of resettling elsewhere, or living in almostcomplete dependence on the governing authorities for life's basic necessities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ A description of the types of measures that a five-yearFIP would include appears in Appendix A to this Notice.Moreover, as was the case for a FIP requiring immediate attainment, therewould be serious questions of enforceability and potential conflicts withother statutes. A five-year FIP, if enforced, would prohibit such essentialelements of daily life as transportation to work, school, ambulance service,and mail delivery. It inevitably would interfere with rights protectedby other statutes.One might content that the creation of a FIP that, when fully implemented,would produce absurd results, might not in itself be considered an absurdresult. This is so, the argument would go, because Congress could alwayslook at the FIP EPA has prepared, and ``veto'' it with new legislationbefore the FIP actually takes effect. But even if this is the case, onecannot discern in the legislative history a ``clear'' Congressional intentthat EPA go through the exercise of creating a five-year plan after 1987.Without clear instructions from Congress, and based on EPA's experiencein developing a FIP for Los Angeles in the 1970s, arguably EPA should notdevelop a plan that would impose dire consequences upon a major centerof economic and social activity. Such an effort would likely be futileand might also seriously undermine the local effort to adopt its own plan.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Interpretation 3: Longer-Term Attainment FIP</ITAG>To adopt an interpretation that leads to the harsh results discussed above,one must conclude that Congress intended to require quick attainment, nomatter what the cost or the consequences. But, one might argue, this visionof the Clean Air Act reads out important elements of the statute, and itslegislative history. One could also argue that, in the circumstances presentedhere, Congress would permit the Administrator to decide upon the earliestattainment date that would avoid such results, avoid a conflict withinthe statute, and carry out the technology- and lifestyle-change forcinggoals of the law.EPA might consider interpreting the statute to require attainment ``asexpeditiously as practicable'',\2\\0\<NOTE/> and by a fixed date. Moreover, other terms of the statuteoffer some implicit support for a longer-term attainment date, since, asnoted above, section 110(a)(2) and Part D criteria assume significant ongoingeconomic activity.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ This formulation corresponds to the goals set forthin sections 110 and 172 of the Act.The legislative history, as we have seen, also reflects deep concern withthe need to balance progress towards clean air with avoidance of severeeconomic disruption. It is therefore unlikely that this Congress wouldhave intended EPA to engage in a FIP process that would overwhelminglyintrude upon and transform a local area.The principal appeal of the longer-term FIP approach is that it providesthe best means of reconciling the twin but conflicting policies embodiedin the statute_that is, it would allow EPA to develop a plan that providesfor progress in air quality, but does not defeat itself with unworkableor preposterously severe requirements. This interpretation would requireattainment at the earliest date possible, but without the severe disruptionthat a shorter-term plan would produce. An outline of what a longer termFIP would include appears in Appendix A.Although the case before us is without direct precedent, we find supportfor this third approach in court decisions in analogous situations. Wherestatutes contain conflicting provisions, or conflicting statutory purposes,courts have held that EPA must harmonize these provisions as best it can,by giving effect to as much of the purposes of the conflicting provisionsas possible. <T3>See Citizens to Save Spencer County v. EPA, </T3>600 F.2d 844 (D.C.Cir. 1979); <T3>NRDC v. Train, </T3>510 F.2d 692, 712 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (allowing extensionsof statutory deadlines for EPA issuance of regulations when EPA demonstratedimpossibility; setting new deadlines by reference to the purpose of thestatutory provisions).As explained above, the requirement that a FIP ``provide for attainmentas expeditiously as possible'' and by a near-term date (section 110(a)(2)(A))may conflict head-on with the requirements in sections 110(a)(2)(D) and110(a)(2)(F) that such a plan be enforceable. Here, as in <T3>Chevron</T3>, this third interpretation could represent ``a reasonableaccommodation of manifestly competing interests * * *.'' 467 U.S. at 865-866.Another important aspect of a longer-term FIP is that it might help vindicateCongress' interest in reinforcing state and local responsibility for airquality. A longer-term FIP could complement, rather than ignore or undermine,ongoing state and local efforts to develop a SIP.Consideration of the long-term FIP interpretation raises important questionsabout how SIPs should be treated in similar circumstances: where the Act'sfirm deadline is past; Congress has failed to provide the relief it expectedto provide; and short-term attainment is impossible. Even if one decidedthat Interpretations 1 or 2 would be most appropriate for determining post-1987deadlines for SIPs, one might still argue that longer deadlines are permissiblefor FIPs. Where SIPs are concerned, the legislative history shows thatCongress explicitly contemplated that, at least prior to 1987, short termdeadlines would apply. The history arguably reveals a Congressional understandingthat, if these deadlines proved too harsh to meet, the major consequencewould be the imposition of a construction ban, a result that Congress addressedand did not find absurd. But the statute does not provide that the constructionban can be imposed as an alternative to writing the required FIP, and thelegislative history demonstrates that the promulgation of a short-termFIP for an area like the South Coast_either before or after 1987_receivedno attention when Congress amended the law in 1977.But one might also conclude that the better approach is one that treatsSIPs and FIPs equally. That is, if impossibility, absurd results, and thefailure of Part D to operate as anticipated, suggest that it would be an<T3>unreasonable </T3>accommodation of the Act's purposes for EPA to preparea near-term FIP, a state, too, should be relieved of the burden of preparingand enforcing a near-term SIP.In EPA's proposed ozone strategy, the Agency suggested a rationale forrequiring SIPs to demonstrate attainment within three to five years. 52FR 45050 (November 24, 1987). A variant of that suggestion would be toapply the three-to-five year date as a general rule, but to exempt statesfrom that requirement where they can make the same kind of showing thatInterpretation 3 argues would relieve EPA of its duty to prepare a short-termFIP. Under this approach, in circumstances where either SIP or FIP attainmentwithin a three- to five-year period would be impossible or lead to absurdresults, EPA would rely on the statutory requirement that attainment occur``as expeditiously as practicable'' to derive a fixed attainment date andto identify reasonable further progress. Sections 110(a)(2)(a) and 172(a)(1).A final ozone policy would identify what reasonable further progress wouldmean under these circumstances. A state that made the proper showings ofimpossibility or absurd results, and submitted a SIP that met all the elementsof the ozone policy, could then obtain EPA's full approval for its SIP,even if the attainment date extended beyond five years.\21\<NOTE/> Even if EPA were unable to fully approve such a state plan,it is not clear that the courts would demand that EPA impose a FIP in suchcircumstances. If EPA reasonably concluded that the SIP measures were asstringent as any plan EPA could justifiably issue, there would no pointin having EPA issue a FIP, since the FIP would merely duplicate the SIP.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\Under this rationale, an attainment deadline of three-fiveyears would be derived from the text of section 110(a)(2)(A) and by analogyfrom Part D; EPA would, however, read the Act as implicitly authorizinga long-term deadline where compliance with that statutory deadline wouldbe impossible or would produce absurd results. There is, however, anotherpossible rationale for a long-term attainment deadline in this circumstance.EPA could conclude that the Clean Air Act contains no uniform, nationwidedeadline applicable now to the South Coast and to the other areas thatfailed to attain the ozone or CO NAAQS by December 31, 1987. EPA wouldreason that the attainment deadlines in Part D (1982 or 1987 for an areawith extreme nonattainment) applied only to the SIP revisions for whichCongress also specified the submittal deadlines (respectively, 1979 and1982); that Part D does not authorize EPA to set a nationwide attainmentdeadline after 1987; and that section 110's deadline of three-five yearsapplies not to a plan revision developed after a SIP call or disapproval,but only to the initial SIP following NAAQS promulgation (or NAAQS revision).Under this rationale, a long-term deadline in the South Coast would satisfythe residual mandates, in sections 110 and 172, that attainment occur bya fixed date that is set, given local circumstances, so as to provide forsuch attainment ``as expeditiously as practicable.''The main objection to the longer-term FIP approach is that, like Interpretation2, it makes EPA, instead of Congress, the dispenser of relief from statutorydeadlines. Arguably, under the Clean Air Act only Congress is authorizedto make this kind of choice.\22\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\Under the rationale for Interpretation 3 set forth infn. 21, however, EPA would make this legislative choice for the South Coastunder its express authority to require or prepare plan revisions that providefor attainment as expeditiously as practicable. The FIP would not overrideany nationwide deadline since, under this rationale, those deadlines specifiedin the Act have expired or are inapplicable in this circumstance.ConclusionEPA here finds itself confronted by a most painful dilemma_one that clearlyneeds a Congressional solution. Absent action by Congress, however, EPAmust do its best to achieve a result most consistent with the language,history, and purposes of the Clean Air Act.If EPA interprets the Act to permit a FIP attainment deadline significantlybeyond 1987, it may stretch the boundaries of the statute in an unprecedentedway, and arguably assume legislative-type authority to direct the paceof technological, economic, and environmental change in the South Coast.The scope of any plan attempting to address the pollution problem in theSouth Coast must be equal to the enormity of that problem. Should EPA determineto prepare a long-term FIP for the South Coast, it would no doubt encountergreat practical difficulties in developing and implementing such a massiveplan.But EPA would also face serious legal and practical problems if it undertooka plan requiring immediate and short-term attainment. The immediate andshort-term FIP interpretations are arguably more in keeping with the originallapsed deadline, and with Congress' expressions of intent to be the providerof relief if deadlines proved too harsh. But these interpretations, ifimposed here, would wreak a level of economic and social disruption thatis likely beyond anything Congress would have imagined would be imposedwithout some mitigation.Thus, there appears to be no easy solution to the problem before us.

The discussionof the five-year FIP focuses on drastic prohibitions that would be requiredon transportation, industrial processes, and consumer products, as wellas out-of-Basin effects of refinery shutdowns, and other secondary effectsthroughout the country. The discussion of the long-term FIP considers severalapproaches to promulgating and implementing a longer-term FIP, perhapsin combination with the current South Coast planning process. EPA solicitscomments on these possible approaches. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">A. Five-Year Federal Implementation Plan </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">SCAQMD and SCAG estimate that the South Coast must reduce VOC emissionsby 80 to 90 percent to attain the ozone standard. A five-year attainmentplan for the South Coast, however, leaves little room for choice amongmeasures, insufficient lead time for the development of the necessary technologies,and hence no opportunity to minimize the most severe social and economicimpacts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">1. Likely Measures </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To achieve the extraordinary emissions reductions necessary for attainmentin the Basin within five years, any plan for the area must wrest substantialreductions from every controllable source of emissions. Such a plan mustinclude restrictions and prohibitions that effectively prevent from operatingwithin the Basin, in the fifth year, almost all reactive hydrocarbon-basedfuel-powered vehicles; eliminate almost all aircraft and marine vesselsfrom the Basin; prohibit almost every industrial source from emitting anyVOCs; dramatically reduce VOC emissions from commercial and residentialsolvents and fuel combustion; and substantially limit agricultural VOCemissions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Assuming that attainment of the ozone standard requires an 80 to 90percent reduction in VOC emissions, and using the draft SIP's 1985 baseyear emissions inventory, the following list of possible federal prohibitionsgives a partial example of a FIP that could bring the area into attainmentof the ozone standard. The fuel limitations applying in the ozone FIP tothe mobile source category should also reduce total CO emissions to a levelwhere attainment of the CO NAAQS throughout the Basin would be achieved.The list set out below represents one possible combination of control measureswith sufficient cumulative emissions reductions to attain the ozone andCO NAAQS. Such a potential FIP would achieve the required emissions levelby applying, in general, an across-the-board reduction to all controllablesource categories. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Full implementation of the FIP might be suspended until the fifthyear unless EPA determines that: (1) Inadequate progress is occuring underthe SIP, or (2) earlier implementation of particular FIP measures is necessary,as a practical matter, in order to ensure that all needed emissions reductionsare achieved by the end of the fifth year. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The FIP would apply within the Counties of Orange, Los Angeles, SanBernardino, and Riverside (alternatively, only within the nonattainmentportion of the counties) and within coastal waters extending 3 miles fromthe onshore county boundaries. The entire Basin must demonstrate attainmentat the end of the the fifth year. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The overhwhelming impacts of a five-year plan might be somewhat lessenedby phasing in implementation over the five-year period. For example, aphased five-year approach could progressively eliminate motor vehicle useof reactive hydrocarbon-based fuels in the Basin, such as at a rate of20 percent per year. A modest degree of prohibition on products, activities,and fuels might stimulate public awareness of, and committment to, lesspolluting options. Measures such as a prohibition on multiple car registration,a requirement for no drive days, and mandatory ridesharing at a more stringentlevel than currently required by the SCAQMD might foster some incrementaladjustments in vehicle dependency, by stimulating the development of additionalcommute alternatives, the elimination of unnecessary vehicle use, and therelocation of jobs and housing. However, EPA does not expect that suchadjustments could allow the great majority of residents of the Basin tocope with the ultimate fifth-year prohibition on essentially every formof private vehicle use, combined with the effective elimination of mostindustrial and commercial opportunities for employment in the Basin. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Fuel restriction for motor vehicles: </T3>The FIP would prevent thesale or use of any reactive hydrocarbon-based fuel in all classes of on-roadmotor vehicles, with the exception of certain vehicles and specified vehicleuses determined to be essential to the public interest. Depending on theemissions still remaining from the motor vehicle category as a result ofallowing this exemption, the FIP might need to require exclusive use inthe exempted vehicles of such low-emitting fuels as methanol, propane,compressed natural gas, or liquified natural gas in lieu of high-emittingfuels such as gasoline or diesel fuel. Since substantial emissions occurfrom motor vehicle traffic into the South Coast, the FIP restriction wouldneed to prohibit this traffic from entering the area. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Fuel restriction for other mobile sources: </T3>All other mobile sources(such as farm and non-farm equipment; boats and vessels; commercial andcivic aircraft; and railroads) would be prohibited from using any fossilfuel, unless the source fell into an exempt category, because it was vitalto the public interest. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Fuel restriction: </T3>The FIP would prevent the manufacture, transport,storage, sale, use, and disposal of any reactive hydrocarbon based fuelwithin the basin, unless exempted as essential to the public interest.The restriction would effectively prohibit refining, storage, and transportationof liquid and gaseous fossil fuels, and combustion of solid, liquid, andgaseous fossil fuels and resource recovery derived fuels. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Industrial and Commercial Solvent and Lubricant restriction: </T3>theFIP would prevent the manufacture, transport, storage, sale, use, and disposalof any reactive hydrocarbon based solvent, lubricant degreaser, surfacecoating, ink, adhesive, fountain solution, thinner, retarder, filler, surfactant,and resin. (Again, a partial exemption for uses in the public interestmight be allowed.) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Restriction on VOC emissions from manufacturing: </T3>The FIP wouldprohibit almost all VOC emissions from manufacturing activities, unlessEPA determined that attainment could be achieved through a less stringentrequirement. The FIP restrictions probably would need to be sufficientto reduce total VOC emissions from all manufacturing facilities by as muchas 90 percent from current SIP levels. Affected industries would includenot only manufacturers of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and rubberproducts, but also most small users of VOC-emitting raw materials. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Restriction on consumer product solvents and aerosol propellants: </T3>TheFIP would either prohibit all products with any VOC emissions or establishVOC limitations to achieve at least a 90 percent reduction from the levelof existing VOC emissions. Consumer products affected by this prohibitionwould include: paints and related products; health and beauty products;automotive polishes and lubricants; cleaners and waxes; and household andgarden pesticides. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; <T3>Restriction on pesticides and herbicides: </T3>The FIP would establishVOC limitations to achieve at least a 90 percent reduction from the levelof existing VOC emissions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Unfortunately, the full range of measures in the South Coast planare clearly not available in a five-year plan because of the time neededto develop or implement many of those measures. In order to accomplishattainment within five years, any control plan would drastically alterthe life of everyone in the Basin. Indeed, a five year attainment planwould eliminate practically any possibility of economic survival for mostresidents within the Basin, either because of the disappearance of jobsfrom the Basin or the inaccessibility of jobs to workers living withinthe Basin.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Typical, everyday life in the Basin generally consists of homelife,including recreational activities, time at work, and time traveling. Everyaspect of a person's life would be changed dramatically by a five yearplan. The following discussion will allow the reader to more clearly envisionthe sort of changes that will be necessary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Transportation.</T3> As described previously, a significant portionof the basin's ozone problem, and essentially all of its CO problem, aredue to mobile sources. Under a five-year plan, emissions from almost allvehicles must be eliminated by the fifth year in order to achieve the neededreductions from this emissions category. EPA believes that it is necessaryand appropriate to exempt from these restrictions, at least partially,certain classes of vehicles, such as mass transit buses, trains, and vans;police cars; emergency response vehicles; fire engines; garbage collectiontrucks; and delivery trucks of food and medical supplies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Any exemption for these vehicles, however, places an even greaterreduction burden on other sources of vehicular emissions. The only wayto realize such a reduction would be to prohibit entirely the use of allnon-essential pollutant-emitting vehicles, since even vehicles burningrelatively clean fuels, such as methanol, propane, compressed natural gas,or liquid natural gas, could cumulatively emit enough emissions of hydrocarbons,nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide to cause continued nonattainment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A plan that eliminated from the area every privately-owned vehicleexcept those that are completely clean (i.e., electrified vehicles) woulddeny access to employment to all but those capable of working at home orcommuting to work by mass transit, vanpool, electric vehicle, bicycle,or foot. Since the average home-to-work commute in the Basin is more than20 miles round trip, it is reasonable to assume that only a small fractionof the current work force would have the ability (either for physical reasonsor from critical time constraints) to commute by bicycle or foot. Furthermore,the opportunities to telecommute are not expected to increase dramaticallywithin five years, though they may develop significantly over the next20 years. All of those jobs heavily dependent upon the use of cars or trucks(including many of the services and trades) would be impossible to pursue,assuming that the FIP were unable to exempt or partially exempt these vehiclesfrom the fuel restriction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If the non-commute transportation modes of the residents of the SouthCoast were effectively limited by the FIP to mass transit, vanpool, bicycles,and foot, this severe restriction on mobility would drastically circumscribemost opportunities for shopping; health care; social, service and recreationalactivity; and general education and vocational training. Thus, the severelyrestricted transportation options of the five-year FIP would profoundlyand comprehensively diminish the quality of life in the area. This restrictionon the public's non-commute activities would contribute still further tothe general economic decline of the area by its extreme impacts on service,recreational, and commercial enterprises.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If a five-year attainment FIP were promulgated, greatly expanded masstransit systems could not be reasonably anticipated, since the generaleconomic decline of the area would, if anything, require cutbacks in publicsubsidies for transit operation and expansion. Expanded service would beparticularly unlikely if the plan needed to prevent mass transit vehiclesfrom burning high-emitting gasoline or diesel fuel. Even if these factorswere absent, it is clear that significant expansions to urban mass transitsystems require lead time for implementation beyond the five-year timeframe.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under any ozone attainment plan in the South Coast, electric vehiclesultimately may be the only feasible motorized alternative to a total dependenceon mass transit. There is no evidence, however, that more than a smallportion of public, private, or commercial transportation needs could bemet by electric vehicles within a five-year time frame. This is due tothe enormous costs of fleet conversion; the need to improve and perfecttechnologies; the lengthy construction period for developing electrifiedmass transit; the time requirements of vehicle manufacturers to redesign,retool, and produce significant numbers of electric vehicles; and the periodrequired for the electric utilities to construct or purchase adequate electricpower generation and distribution systems to meet the radically increaseddemands for electricity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A five-year plan would offer no realistic opportunity for clean transportationalternatives to aircraft, locomotives, marine vessels, and heavy duty dieseltrucks. Since significant emissions reductions appear to be necessary fromthese transportation categories, elimination of most commerce is likelyto result. For example, it is unlikely that the many industries dependentupon these transportation sources would be able to continue operation inthe Basin. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The five-year FIP would have national and possibly global implicationsif it did eliminate these current means of transportation, since the Basinincludes the most active commercial port area on the West Coast. In addition,air, truck, and rail transport into and through the Basin plays a criticalrole for industry, commerce, and communication in the Western United States.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Industry. </T3>Approximately a quarter of the Basin's VOC emissionscomes from industrial and manufacturing facilities. Industrial sourcesof ozone precursors and CO include both manufacturing facilities that usesolvents in their processes and other facilities, such as fossil-fuel firedboilers, turbines, internal combustion engines, and furnaces that emitozone precursors and CO directly as a result of the combustion process,manufacturing, fabrication, or assembly. In a five-year time frame thereis no viable technological or economic opportunity to eliminate emissionsfrom many if not all of these facilities without effectively requiringshutdown. The draft South Coast plan contemplates the eventual eliminationof combustion sources and an almost total replacement of solvent emissions.It envisions this change as taking place over 20 years through a processof forced technological advances (most prominently, in the area of solventcomposition and use), expanded energy conservation projects, and almosttotal electrification of the area, with all generating capacity locatedoutside of the basin. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In order to obtain the needed reductions from industry, a five-yearplan must not only secure an 80 to 90 percent reduction in VOC emissionsfrom existing industry, it must also prohibit economic growth of any kind.Remaining sources that are not currently operating at full capacity wouldbe prohibited from increasing production, because, to do so, they wouldgenerate more emissions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It would also be necessary to ban the use of reactive solvents incoatings, degreasing, and other uses or, at the least, apply restrictionsthat would achieve an additional 90% reduction in VOC emissions from industrialactivities. The largest contributor to point source VOC emissions are ofsurface coating operations whose emissions come from the evaporation ofthe solvent contained in the coatings. In a five-year time frame it willnot be possible for technology to totally replace solvent-based coatings;thus, it will be necessary to ban the use of coatings which cannot be changed.Major industries in the basin such as paint manufacturers, paint contractors,auto assembly plants, wood furniture manufacturers, can and coil coaters,paper coaters, printers, aerospace, and semi-conductor and electronicswill be forced to discontinue or drastically curtail operations, with theinevitable result of massive unemployment and the ripple effects of unemploymenton the area's economy. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Out-Basin Impacts of Refinery/Marine Terminal Shutdowns in the Basin</T3>.Southern California is the largest petroleum refining and distributionarea on the West Coast. Some of the refined petroleum products now producedin the Basin or produced elsewhere but imported into the Basin throughLos Angeles harbor are subsequently exported to markets outside the Basin.Thus, federally required shutdowns of petroleum refining and trans shippingoperations in the South Coast Air Basin would have severe effects not onlyin the Basin, but in other areas as well. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Virtually all of the gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and heatingoil used in Yuma, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; and the Imperial Valley ofCalifornia is shipped from the Basin via the Southern Pacific Pipelineand the Calnev Pipeline. There are no refineries outside the Basin whichcan supply these landlocked markets via existing pipelines. A shutdownin the Basin would therefore require that new pipelines be built or thatpetroleum products be shipped by tank truck on public highways or by railcar, resulting in much higher transportation costs. Even if refineriesin other areas could increase production to satisfy these markets (whichfortunately are relatively small), prices to consumers would increase substantially.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A portion of the petroleum products used in San Diego, California,also are delivered via pipeline from producers and/or marine importerslocated in the basin. San Diego presently receives shipments via vesselsas well, and these would presumably be increased at some cost for facilityexpansion. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A very serious situation would also develop in Phoenix and Tucson,Arizona and outlying areas that receive deliveries by tank truck from thesecities. About two-thirds of the refined products used in or distributedfrom these two large and rapidly growing urban areas come from the SouthCoast Air Basin via pipeline. The remainder now comes via pipeline fromEl Paso, Texas but the capacity of this pipeline is too limited to supplythe full demand. The four refiners with access to this pipeline (locatedin El Paso and Odessa, Texas and Artesia, New Mexico) may also lack sufficientprocessing capacity and/or crude oil supply to compensate for loss of productfrom Basin sources, even if transporting the additional volume to Phoenixand Tucson were not a problem. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, a number of military air bases in California and Arizonarely on Basin sources for their supplies of jet fuel. Costs would increaseand reliability of supply decrease if jet fuel had to be transported bytank truck from other refineries or ports. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Consumer sources. </T3>Almost a quarter of the VOC emissions in theBasin comes from the direct consumer use of certain products and relatedservices. Products affected by a prohibition would include paints, primers,varnishes, lubricants and silicones, hair sprays, car polishes and waxes,room deodorants and disinfectants, moth control products, personal deodorants,auto antifreezes, brake cleaners, engine starting fluids, all purpose cleaners,floor waxes, insect repellants, starch and fabric finish, rug and upholsterycleaners, aftershaves, animal insecticides, shaving lathers, perfumes,spot removers, adhesives, insect sprays, caulking and sealing compounds,window cleaners, herbicides and fungicides, suntan lotions, and many otheritems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Many of these products are also used by small businesses which provideconsumer services, such as drycleaners, painting contractors, automotiveand small engine repair shops, printers, barber and beauty shops, bakeries,exterminators, and home and office cleaning services. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In order to achieve the needed reductions from this category, a five-yearFIP would have to impose nearly a total ban on the use of these productsand related services. While a five-year time frame may be adequate to developand market some technological alternatives, there would certainly be manyproducts to which the public has become accustomed that would disappearwith such a ban. The repercussions from this action would be far-ranging,affecting the consumer and the industries involved. It is unknown at thistime whether alternative products can be found in the amount of time available.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A major exemption from this category would be hospitals, health carecenters, nursing homes, schools, child day care centers and other facilitieswhere high levels of cleanliness are required to protect the public health.Again, these exempted emissions would need to be offset by tighter restrictionson the remaining sources. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. <T3>``Multiplier Effect''. </T3>As the above consequences are encounteredover five years, there will be ``multiplier'' effects. As industries, autodealerships, service stations, and other enterprises close and are forcedto lay off thousands of people, the companies and employees will try torelocate outside the Basin. The relocation costs will be enormous. Thetax base of the Basin's jurisdictions will be depleted, so that those jurisdictionswill be hard pressed to provide necessary services (police protection,water and sewer treatment, primary and secondary education, health andwelfare benefits, etc.). Since the Basin will become an economically undesirableplace in which to live, housing prices will drop dramatically, and mostpersons forced to leave the Basin will be unable to sell their houses orbusiness, so they will suffer tremendous financial losses. The lendinginstitutions will be unable to resell those properties after the borrowersdefault on their mortgages, so many of them will also be forced out ofbusiness. If these institutions or their depositors are rescued by Federalinsurance agencies, the cost of doing so will be felt throughout the nation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Recreational activities for those remaining Basin residents wouldbe severely limited. Sporting events would be affected by the lack of transportationalternatives. Amusement parks, movie theaters, shopping malls, restaurants,and many other entertainment sources would be forced to close because patronswould be unable to drive to them as in the past. Many other weekend activitieswould be eliminated as a result of prohibitions against private vehicleuse. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">National companies with offices or plants in the Basin may be economicallyaffected so severely that they may go out of business altogether. Thiswould cause a dramatic drain on the national economy from higher unemployment,higher prices, product shortages, and higher taxes to offset lost revenues.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Many other ripple effects may result which cannot be anticipated atthis time. However, the above discussion provides a suggestion of the magnitudeof impact a five-year FIP would have on the South Coast and the entirecountry. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">B. Possible Approaches to Longer-Term FIP </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the body of this notice, EPA described the draft Air Quality ManagementPlan (AQMP) that the South Coast Air Quality Management District is developing.This plan contemplates attainment within roughly ten years for CO and twentyyears for ozone. The following discussion describes the relative rolesthat the South Coast and EPA are capable of playing in producing an adequateplan, and how EPA might coordinate its FIP effort with the current SouthCoast planning process. EPA discusses three approaches it might take tomeet its FIP obligation without undermining the state and local planningeffort, but in fact building on those efforts. EPA specifically requestscomments on all aspects of these options as well as identification of andcomments on any other FIP options that EPA should consider. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Option 1: </ITAG>The ``Reasonable Progress Backstop'' Approach <ITAG tagnum="21">This approach assumes that EPA's analysis of the South Coast planas finally submitted as a SIP revision allows the Agency to conclude thatthe 1997 and 2007 deadlines in the proposed South Coast plan satisfy the``reasonable efforts'' requirements of the Clean Air Act. It assumes furtherthat the South Coast AQMP includes a schedule by which the State wouldsubmit various measures in legally binding form after the date by whichEPA must promulgate its FIP. In that event, EPA could promulgate ``backstop''FIP control measures which would be triggered automatically upon EPA'sdetermination of a failure to achieve the progress in emission reductionsthat the AQMP schedule prescribed. The FIP backstop measures would consistof a predetermined sequence of control measures (possibly adjusted fromtime to time based on development of new control technologies) that couldbe implemented to eliminate any shortfall in the emission reductions requiredin the SIP. It is impossible to predict a complete list of measures thatmay be considered appropriate at that time, but the list would includeat least the kinds of prohibitions and limitations discussed in the previousdescription of five-year FIP options (e.g., limitations on industrial andcommercial activities, fuel sales or usage restrictions). The FIP backstopcontrol measures would be implemented only to the extent necessary to eliminateany shortfall in targeted SIP emission reductions, and would be rescindedif the state and local agencies adopted mitigating control measures oftheir own. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If EPA decides to promulgate FIP further progress targets that aredifferent from those included in the SIP, this could alter the size ofthe shortfall to be mitigated by the backstop measures. For instance, EPAmight use the targets set in its own post-1987 ozone and CO policy proposal.The proposed policy, which may be revised before final issuance, wouldrequire a three percent annual emissions reduction in actual emissionsfrom a fixed baseyear emissions inventory, exclusive of reductions attributableto Federally implemented control measures and certain other ``baseline''measures (see 52 FR 45066 and 45091). Alternatively, EPA could select anon-linear schedule extending from the emissions baseline to the allowableemissions level for the Basin, and reflecting EPA's estimation of expeditiousprogress based upon an ambitious schedule of developing and applying newtechnologies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EPA's proposed post-1987 policy allows compliance with the three percentminimum reduction through demonstrations every three years that a ninepercent reduction has been achieved (for the first five years, the proposedpolicy would allow a showing that a fifteen percent reduction has beenmet). The proposed South Coast plan shows future emissions levels onlyat the years 2000 and 2010, with interim year emissions levels identifiableonly through extrapolation. EPA invites public comment on whether, underthis approach, emissions levels should be promulgated, tracked, and enforcedon an annual basis, or whether the FIP might prescribe emissions levelson a less frequent basis (such as biennially or triennially). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under the various versions of this approach, the FIP could promulgatespecific basinwide emissions levels for interim years leading to eventualattainment. The emissions levels could be expressed as basinwide emissionsin tons per day representative of typical summer weekday conditions forozone and representative of typical winter weekday conditions for CO. Inthe case of ozone, the basinwide emissions could be prescribed for NO<T2>x</T2> as well as volatile organic compounds (VOC), if EPA concludesthat reductions in emissions of NO<T2>x</T2> (a precursor to ozone, along with VOC) are necessary or cost-effectiveto prescribe.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This approach requires that EPA keep close watch on the progress theSouth Coast achieves as it implements the SIP. The FIP might include aspecial provision requiring from the State timely annual reports on progressin achieving emissions reductions from individual control measures. TheFIP might also require the State to track basin-wide emissions increasesand decreases in accordance with detailed EPA instructions and then calculateactual emissions for the basin. EPA may also need to impose some specificrecord keeping and reporting requirements for sources, transportation agencies,and other jurisdictions to assist in monitoring activity levels. With orwithout these requirements for data collection, EPA would remain responsiblefor determining the emissions levels in the basin and whether, and to whatextent, surplus emissions exist.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Option 2: </ITAG>``SIP Backstop'' Approach<ITAG tagnum="21">The ``SIP Backstop'' option is similar to Option 1 but uses, as ameasure for progress, the State and local adoption schedule and implementationof control measures, rather than the annual emissions ceiling in the SIP.Under this option, backstop measures promulgated in the initial FIP (oras subsequently adjusted) would become effective automatically if the Stateand local authorities failed to adopt either the SIP rules or substitutecontrol measures with equivalent emissions reductions. As in Option 1,backstop measures would be rescinded if and when the State or local agenciesadopted mitigating measures on their own.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Option 3: </ITAG>SIP Approval in Lieu of FIP<ITAG tagnum="21">As discussed in the body of this notice, EPA believes that approvalof a state or local air quility plan is far preferable to EPA's promulgatinga FIP, and EPA strongly supports the South Coast AQMP development processnow underway. The proposed AQMP, however, relies heavily on the developmentof future technologies, funding mechanisms, governmental infrastructures,and long-term societal adjustments. Inevitably, many of the most significantAQMP measures are represented largely as commitments to develop in enforceableform over many years the rules, ordinances, and other implementation mechanismsnecessary for the success of the plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EPA intends to approve these state and local SIP commitments, at leastfor the purposes of making them federally enforceable, as soon as theyare adopted and submitted in legally binding form, and assuming that theyotherwise comply with other Federal requirements. EPA does not anticipatethat the state and local agencies will be able to submit most control measuresin fully developed and fully approvable form for many years.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed AQMP is not expected to meet initially allof EPA's existing requirements for proper adoption of measures, includingprovisions for legal authority, binding commitments, specificity of limitations,funding, scheduling, approval of appropriate governmental agencies, andmonitoring. As such, under EPA's current policies, full and complete approvalof the entire pending SIP in lieu of a FIP must be considered a romotepossibility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If, however, the State were to submit a complete, legally adoptedplan by the time EPA were to promulgate its FIP, then EPA could find thatthe SIP measures are sufficient to meet Clean Air Act requirements withoutadditional Federal measures. EPA would then be able to avoid any FIP actionand approve the State plan in full, under at least one of the legal theoriesdescribed in the test of today's notice (see footnotes 20 and 21 and accompanyingtext).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">C. Discussion of the Possibility of Other Types of Federal Measures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition to the relatively simple prohibitory FIP measures discussedabove, or the list of measures in the local plan, EPA could promulgatein the FIP, at least in theory, other types of federal initiatives thatmight expedite emission reduction progress in the Basin. These measureswould consist of rules that would supplement the existing and proposedstate and local regulations with particular measures applying specificcontrol technology requirements or embodying other available regulatoryapproaches.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As explained elsewhere in this notice, EPA generally believes thatthe responsibility for selecting and implementing air pollution controlmeasures rests principally with state and local agencies rather than withEPA. In addition, this notice also discusses the possibility that EPA maylack the authority and resources to promulgate and enforce many types ofregulations in a South Coast FIP, particularly those rules that would mandatesubstantial economic and social change. EPA considers most conventionalFIP control approaches to be difficult to implement under a FIP, even assumingfederal resources and authority sufficient for enforcement of regulationsthat require the compliance of thousands of sources or millions of residents.Such controls could also be expected to attract state and local opposition,rather than to enlist that level of support that is a prerequisite to successfulimplementation. However, we discuss below certain areas where EPA believesa limited active supplemental federal role is or may be possible and appropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">1. Currently Planned Federal Measures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EPA proposed to impose nationally two VOC control measures See 52FR 31162; 52 FR 31,274; (August 19, 1987): (1) Control of refueling emissionsthrough onboard vehicle control systems for gasoline fueled light-dutyvehicles and trucks and heavy-duty trucks; and (2) volatility regulationsfor gasoline and alcohol blends. Because of the current South Coast regulationimposing Stage II refueling controls at service stations, the first ofthese proposed national promulgations would not be expected to providesignificant emissions reductions within the Basin. EPA's proposed restrictionson gasoline volatility would contribute emission reductions beyond thoseidentified in the South Coast plan, and would therefore expedite progressin reducing ozone concentrations in the Basin.\1\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The most common measure of fuel volatility is the ReidVapor Pressure (RVP). RVP is a measure of the tendency of gasoline to evaporateat 100 degrees Fahrenheit. As RVP increases, evaporative hydrocarbon emissionsfrom gasoline related sources, i.e., motor vehicles and the gasoline transportationand distribution system, increase.<ITAG tagnum="28">California State law currently limits the RVP of gasoline in the SouthCoast Basin to 9 pounds square inch (psi) for the seven-month period, April1 through October 31. EPA has proposed national standards for RVP thatwould limit fuel for the period May 16 through September 15 to the followinglevels: 7.8 psi in Orange County and western Los Angles County, and 7.0psi in Riverside County, San Bernardino County, and eastern Los AngelesCounty (see 52 FR 31274 and 31315, August 19, 1987). The draft South Coastplan includes a measure to tighten the State standard to 8.0 psi. In theyear 2000, this would amount to reductions of 9.6 tons per day of VOC,16.5 tons per day of CO, and 7.4 tons per day of NO</ITAG><T2>x</T2>. The proposed plan also encourages EPA to work with the FAAto demonstrate and evaluate the potential for methanol-jet fuel use. Theplan estimates that significant additional reductions could result froma requirement for methanol fuel.<ITAG tagnum="71">2. Other Federal Measures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The South Coast plan assigns to either EPA or other federal agenciesthe following measures, because of legal constraints on the authority ofstate or local governments. EPA solicits comment as to whether these orother measures should be included in a FIP or another federal promulgationin the case of other federal agencies:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Lower Emissions Standards for Aircraft Engines. </T3>The proposed SouthCoast plan lists as one of the Tier I control measures lower emission standardsfor VOC and NO<T2>X</T2> from new jet aircraft engines. The plan's control measure (I-2)projects a 50 percent reduction in emissions for all pollutants.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under Section 231 of the Clean Air Act EPA has authority to promulgatesuch standards, but under Section 233 state and local governments are prohibitedfrom adopting standards of their own, although they may adopt and enforceEPA's standards. Because aircraft must circulate freely throughout theU.S. to serve their purpose, nationwide regulation would be needed to achievereductions in the basin.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At present, EPA standards for aircraft engines apply only to commercialjet engines. The standards exclude non-commercial aircraft and all piston-drivenengines. Engines smaller than a certain size are also excluded. There areEPA standards for VOC, smoke, and fuel venting, but not for NO<T2>X</T2> or CO. The VOC standards apply only for engines manufacturedafter 1983, although EPA has statutory authority to require retrofit ofengines manufactured previously. However, smoke standards apply to allin-use commercial jet engines, regardless of age, and the technology used,for smoke control on pre-1983 engines provides some degree of VOC control.The present standards were established by a rulemaking process that spannedeleven years, ending in 1984. The draft plan in effect proposes that thesecurrent exclusions be removed, and that more stringent standards for newlycertified engines be adopted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some degree of NO<T2>X</T2> control, more stringent VOC control, retrofit of 1983 and olderengines, controls on smaller engines, and controls on some non-commercialjet engines may be technologically feasible with adequate lead time fordevelopment, certification, production, and installation. However, theprevious rulemaking process surfaced several concerns about safety, costs,industry disruption, and unintentional disincentives for technologicalprocess that led EPA to adopt the standards as they now exist. The costand favorable emission reduction estimates contained in the draft planappear to be based largely on EPA analyses from about 1978, and apparentlyhave not been adjusted for inflation and aircraft fleet mix and usage changessince then. EPA's experience from having established the current standardsin the 1970's is that adoption of standards for jet engines is a processthat requires much more time than for most stationary sources or for motorvehicles. The time frame for implementation of new standards would mostlikely entend beyond five years, the typical period for Tier I controlmeasure implementation. Thus, new standards most likely would not playa role in a five-year FIP.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Controls. </T3>It may be possible toassist attainment in the South Coast basin by tightening federal controlson OCS emissions sources (primarily, petroleum exploration and development),or by negotiating agreements between the Department of Interior and stateor local agencies to allow for partial state or local regulation of OCSsources. The amount of ozone or ozone precursors affecting the South Coastbasin from OCS emissions is difficult to forecast. It is heavily dependentupon the scale, location, and form of future petroleum development, aswell as the type of emissions control applied.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">3. Potential Federal Measures Not Included in South Coast Draft Plan</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Lastly, there are a few potential measures that are not included inthe draft South Coast Plan. In theory, these measures could be in a FIPif they are not included in the final South Coast plan. EPA solicits commentfrom the public as to whether any of the following measures should be includedin the FIP. As stated above, EPA continues to feel that the state and localagencies are the appropriate level of government for selection and implementationof these potential measures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Wintertime Oxygenated Gasoline Blend Program. </T3>The use of oxygenatedgasoline blends to reduce the CO emissions from motor vehicles is a recentdevelopment in air pollution control strategies. The use of these fuelsduring the CO season (winter months) has been mandated for the Denver nonattainmentarea, and more recently, for the Phoenix and Tucson nonattainment areas.Oxygenated fuels reduce CO emissions because the air-to-fuel ratio is madeleaner, thus providing more oxygen which results in more complete combustion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Oxygenated blends are produced by adding an oxygenate in the formof aliphatic alcohols and/or ethers to gasoline. Blends currently on themarket include methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether (MTBE) blends, ethanol (``gasohol'')blends, and methanol/co-solvent blends.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">All alcohol-based oxygenates affect the volatility of the gasoline,i.e., its tendency to evaporate at various temperatures. Unless completelyoffset, these volatility changes may increase a vehicle's evaporative hydrocarbonemissions (i.e., fuel which evaporates and escapes to the air before itis burned in the engine). The use of oxygenated blends could increase hydrocarbonemissins from motor vehicles and possibly interfere with the attainmentof the ozone standard in the South Coast basin during those time periodswhen the ozone and CO seasons overlap. Additionally, the use of oxygenatedfuels results in increased NO<T2>X</T2> emissions (less than 10 percent) which could adversely affectthe attainment of the NO<T2>2</T2> standard and the PM-10 standard due to secondary aerosol formation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EPA requests comments on the following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) whether the promulgation of a wintertime oxygenated blends programis an appropriate CO control strategy for the South Coast basin given theimpact the program might have on other pollutants;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) if an oxygenated fuel blends program is promulgated, whether allblends should be subject to sufficiently stringent Reid Vapor Pressure(see discussion above) so that there is no increase in hydrocarbon emissionsdue to the use of these blends;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) whether an oxygenated blends program will impact the introductioninto the basin of alternatively fueled vehicles capable of using, for example,a fuel consisting of at least 85 percent methanol, compressed natural gasor liquid petroleum gas; and (4) whether an oxygenated fuels program wouldbe compatible with the draft plan's proposal to require electrificationof most motor vehicles in the basin by the year 2007.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Enhanced Inspection and Maintenance Program.</T3> California's currentInspection and Maintenance (I/M) program requires that gasoline-fueledmotor vehicles be subjected to a tailpipe emissions test for hydrocarbons(HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) in an idle or idle and 2500 rpm (1980 andnewer model year vehicles) mode and a tampering inspection biennially.Vehicles twenty years of age or newer and up to 8500 pounds gross vehicleweight are included in the program. Vehicles are tested at independentlyrun authorized stations. Vehicles receive waivers if they fail the emissionstest but cannot be repaired to the standards for $50 or less. Heavy dutygasoline vehicles are scheduled to be included in the program beginningin October 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In September 1988, the Governor of California signed legislation (SB1997, Presley) amending the repair cost ceiling to between $50 for 1971and older model year vehicles up to $300 for 1990 and newer vehicles, effectiveJanuary 1, 1990. The new law has the following additional provisions: 1966and newer vehicles will be subject to the program; new, more sophisticatedexhaust gas analyzers must be in place no later than January 1, 1992; andlocal air pollution control districts may request NO<T2>x</T2> testing which might be implemented by means of loaded mode testing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In order to obtain the maximum benefit from the I/M program, EPA mightpromulgate an enhanced I/M program which could require annual inspectionof all 1966 and newer gasoline fueled vehicles. Other potential enhancementscould include: (1) Inspections conducted at centralized facilities; (2)emissions testing of vehicles in a loaded mode as well as in the idle modecondition; and (3) measurements of NO<T2>x</T2> emissions as well as HC and CO emissions. Also all vehiclescould be required to be repaired to the standards, <T3>i.e.</T3>, there would be no limit on the amount the motorist mighthave to spend to bring the vehicles into compliance with the standards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Any centralized inspection facilities would be run by an independentcontractor or an agency under contract to EPA. EPA would maintain oversightover the program. EPA would hope that the program would continue to beenforced by registration through the California Department of Motor Vehicles.Although EPA may have the authority to assess fees for such a program,any monies generated would go directly into the U.S. Treasury and wouldrequire a Congressional appropriation to be returned to a federally promulgatedI/M program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>New Source Review (NSR) Program.</T3> While the proposed South Coastplan includes a new source review measure (F-8) tightening the existingNSR requirements for the permitting of new or modified emissions sources,it is not clear that the SCAQMD now contemplates, or will ultimately embody,NSR provisions comparable to the two discussed below.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">i. <T3>Prohibition on the Use of Shutdown Emission Reduction Credits.</T3>Relatively unmitigated minor source growth and the use of banked emissionscredits to offset stationary source growth in the South Coast severelyrestrict or eliminate potential NSR contribution to achieving air qualitygoals. While control technologies have gotten increasingly effective atreducing emissions from permitted sources, the use of certain types ofoffsets, often from shutdowns many years past, has neutralized possibleair quality gains. The SCAQMD and Region 9 agree that the current federalconstruction ban on major new or modified sources will have a negligibleimpact on the number and types of sources receiving permits in the SouthCoast Basin.\2\<NOTE/> The SCAQMD thresholds for the aplication of BACT/LAER andoffsetting are already significantly below federal levels and affect alarge proportion of sources within the basin. On the other hand, applicationsfor new or modified sources with emissions above the federal constructionban levels are extremely rare.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The Clean Air Act requires EPA to enforce a ban on constructionof major stationary sources and major modifications, following disapprovalof a nonattainment area plan (see discussion above on EPA's disapprovalof the South Coast SIP for ozone and CO). The construction ban regulationsapply only to new sources with the potential to emit 100 tons per yearor more of the relevant pollutant or pollutant precursor, and to modificationswith a net emissions increase of 100 tons per year for CO and 40 tons peryear of VOC. See 40 CFR 52.24.<ITAG tagnum="21">EPA could promulgate an NSR rule for the basin using the existingSouth coast offset threshold levels but prohibiting for use as an offsetor in the determination of net emission increase all Emission ReductionCredits (ERC's) derived from shutdowns prior to 1985. Thereafter, creditsfrom shutdowns would be available for use as ERC's (to the extent not otherwisedisallowed by federal NSR requirements) but only within a three-year periodfollowing the actual shutdown. In addition, ERC's would be available fromthe application of innovative or excess controls. These ERC's would notbe subject to the three-year restriction on use.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EPA's promulgation could also expedite progress toward attainmentby discounting all ERC's derived from shutdowns. The discount could providethat the calculation of shutdown credits assume that the source were controlledto a level equivalent to the best available retrofit control technology(BARCT), determined as of the date of permit application for the sourceintending to use the credit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">ii. <T3>Penalty for Failure to Obtain an NSR Permit.</T3> Sources constructingand operating in the basin without a permit may be considered to be emittingthe equivalent of uncontrolled and/or unmitigated air pollution. Many permitapplications in the SCAQMD backlog are for facilities that were constructedwithout a permit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EPA could promulgate a penalty for failure to apply for an NSR permit.The penalty should be substantial enough to act as a deterrent to sidesteppingthe regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Conformity Program.</T3> Section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act prohibitsfederal agencies from taking actions that do not conform to approved SIPs,and prohibits metropolitan planning organizations, such as SCAG, from approvingsuch actions. Strong conformity provisions in the South Coast would ensurethat federally funded and approved projects do not lead to further degradationof the Basin's air quality.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The 1982 South Coast SIP includes conformity requirements. Conformityprovisions are also included in the draft South Coast plan. SCAG has alsoformed a conformity working group, which includes EPA, to refine theseconformity provisions. The FIP would address any deficiencies that remainafter agency revision. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EPA will review the South Coast Plan according to, and base any neededFIP requirements on, previously published notices addressing conformity:45 FR 21590 (April 1, 1980); 46 FR 7182 (January 22, 1981); and 52 FR 45055(November 24, 1987). The elements needed for a fully effective conformityprogram include: (a) Conformity review procedures, (b) growth projectionsand a disaggregation process, (c) estimates of emissions for major federalprojects, (d) conformity review criteria (45 FR 21590), (e) specificationof information that must be provided for conformity determinations (growth,emissions, TCM consistency, modeling) and, (f) requirements for a findingof non-conformity if projects do not satisfy the review criteria or insufficientinformation is provided.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">D. Comparison of Five-year and Longer-Term FIPS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">How would the impact of the five-year FIP compare with that of theSouth Coast twenty-year plan? First, both plans envision roughly the samereductions, one within five, the other within 20 years.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The South Coast's proposed plan, however, pursues a technology forcingstrategy in order to establish clean alternatives to existing transportation,industrial, commercial, and domestic fuels, equipment, materials, and activities.The South Coast plan avoids much of the sudden and extreme social and economicdislocations that are unavoidable in a five-year attainment period, byallowing time for the development and practical application of the technologiesthat are required or encouraged by the proposed plan. These technologiesinclude, most notably, clean fuels or engines for mobile sources (withelectrification of most surface vehicles); nonreactive industrial, commercial,and domestic solvents; and further stringent controls for a viarety ofstationary and area sources of VOC or NO<T2>x</T2>. In addition, the South Coast plan seeks to minimize the technologicalburden borne by the transportation sector by providing a comprehensivevariety of transportation and land use control measures to reduce the existingdependency on private vehicle use, and to reduce future needs for additionalprivate vehicle trips to accommodate growth in population and employment.Most of these transportation and land use measures (such as provisionsfor jobs-housing balance or construction of new mass transit facilities)necessarily involve lead times of at least five years and, in some cases,more than 15 years, for full implementation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">1. State and Local Expertise</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EPA has not yet fully analyzed all features of the South Coast AQMP,and does not yet know if it is adequate to provide for attainment, or whetherit can be fully implemented within its projected timeframe. But the SCAQMDhas consistently been recognized as one of the nation's most comprehensive,progressive, and effective air quality control agencies, particularly withrespect to the development, application and refinement of effective controlsof ozone precursors, VOC and NO<T2>x</T2>. Their effort on the proposed AQMP, in conjunction with SCAG's,includes identifying and scheduling for adoption every feasible stationarysource, transportation, and mobile source control measure. The plan hasscheduled pilot studies, legislative needs, funding commitments, publicawareness programs, and implementation time frames.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EPA's involvement in the South Coast planning effort has primarilybeen to oversee and provide technical assistance to the state and localagencies. EPA has limited expertise in the specific approaches that wouldbe used to control emissions in the Basin. Much of EPA's regulatory approachto the control of emissions continues to be derived from the knowledgeand experience of the SCAQMD and the ARB in the control of stationary,area, and mobile sources.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EPA would be unable to implement many of the measures identified inthe South Coast draft plan. Many control strategies require commitmentson the local level and must be initiated by local agencies. These includeland use measures, incentive based transportation control measures (TCMs),and long-range transit planning. Because of the nature of these controlmeasures, and the fact that there are over 150 local jurisdictions in thebasin, local government coordination is essential.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EPA believes that air quality benefits are best achieved through afederal partnership with the state and local planning agencies to ensurethat all needed control measures are adopted, monitored, and enforced primarilyat the state and local levels. The SCAQMD, SCAG, ARB, and EPA have beenworking together successfully to refine control strategies included inthe draft plan to generate local support for controversial measures. Federalpreemption of the planning process, at the culmination of a uniquely ambitiousand resource intensive planning process, could jeopardize the extensiveefforts and progress of the state and local agencies and jurisdictions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">2. Federal Versus State/Local Resource Allocation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The staff and budgets of the local and state agencies responsiblefor solving the air pollution problems in the Basin far exceed currentlybudgeted federal sources. The staff levels in the fiscal year 1989 budgetsof the SCAQMD and the ARB are 900 and 670, respectively; this combinedwork force is more than 22 times the staff size (70) of the Air ManagementDivision (AMD) in the EPA Region 9 office in San Francisco. The Region9 office is responsible for directly implementing or overseeing the implementationof the Clean Air Act throughout the states of California, Arizona, Nevada,Hawaii, and the Pacific Islands. The approximate fiscal year 1989 budgetsof the three agencies are similarly proportioned:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="38">SCAQMD</ITAG>.....$75,000,000<ITAG tagnum="38">ARB</ITAG>.....$58,000,000<ITAG tagnum="38">EPA Region 9 (AMD)</ITAG>.....$3,500,000<ITAG tagnum="21">The imbalance of federal and state/local air pollution planning resourcesis still more extreme when the staff and budget of SCAG are considered.SCAG, which is the largest of the approximately 700 Councils of Governmentin the country, shares responsibility with the SCAQMD for preparation ofthe local air pollution control plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix B: Technical Issues</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">I. Developing the Federal Implementation Plan</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This Appendix is intended to provide a better understanding of thetechnical issues associated with the FIP process. The process of developingan implementation plan is similar whether the plan is to be promulgatedby the state, as a SIP, or by the federal government, as a FIP. Typically,states have been given only nine months to prepare and submit to EPA afully adopted and approvable plan. During this time, EPA must completeappropriate guidance, and the state must gather information, conduct ananalysis of the problem, select appropriate control measures, and writeand adopt a plan. Because the development of post-1987 plans is expectedto be more difficult than previous efforts, EPA, in its proposed policyto address continued nonattainment of the ozone and CO NAAQS, proposedto allow states two years to develop post-1987 ozone and CO SIPs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In order to produce a technically sound plan, the following typesof activities are required:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. development of data bases (inventories)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. determination of emission reduction requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. selection of control measures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. preparation of the FIP or SIP</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e. review and adoption of the plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">A. Development of Data Bases</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Current Emission Inventory.</T3> An emission inventory of air pollutantsand their sources is essential in identifying major contributors of aircontaminants. Sources of emissions are classified as either stationaryor mobile sources. Stationary sources are further divided into point andarea sources.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The most recent comprehensive inventory for the South Coast is forthe base year 1983. For the purposes of the South Coast draft plan, the1983 inventory was updated to create a 1985 base year emission inventory.The next comprehensive update is expected in 1990 for the base year 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A technical evaluation of the South Coast draft plan inventory andprojections has not yet been performed. However, some preliminary conclusionscan be drawn about the inventory. Stationary VOC sources in the South Coastinclude surface coating operations, consumer use products, petroleum processing,and industrial/manufacturing processes. The total VOC contribution fromstationary point and area sources comprises 48 percent of the inventory.For NO<T2>x</T2>, stationary point and area sources contribute 28 percent ofthe inventory. The major stationary NO<T2>x</T2> sources include electric utilities, petroleum refineries, andmanufacturing/industrial process. Stationary sources contribute only 4percent to the CO inventory and are mostly fuel combustion sources.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mobile source emissions are attributed to on-road vehicles (automobiles;light, medium, and heavy duty trucks; buses; and motorcycles) and othermobile sources (airplanes, ships, trains, and mobile utility equipment).On-road vehicles account for 46 percent of the VOC emissions, 59 percentof the NO<T2>x</T2> emissions, and 87 percent of the CO emissions in the South Coast.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Forecasted Emission Inventories.</T3> The 1985 base year inventoryhas been projected to create the baseline inventory for 2000 and 2010.The projected inventories take into account existing control strategiespresently in the South Coast, including the California and the FederalMotor Vehicle Control Programs (CMVCP) and (FMVCP), and anticipated stationaryand mobile source growth.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Due to existing efforts of local, state and federal air pollutioncontrol agencies, per source emissions of VOC, CO, and NO<T2>x</T2> in the South Coast are declining. The SCAQMD estimates thatper source emissions will continue to decline in the near future becauseof the effect of existing controls on air pollution sources. The majorreason for this steady decrease in per source emissions is the expectedturnover of vehicles in use due to the implementation of the CMVCP andthe FMVCP. As older cars, which have higher emissions, are replaced bynewer, cleaner burning cars, the associated emissions have decreased.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As noted above, however, the South Coast Basin is growing in populationat a remarkable rate. If the excess cumulative emissions caused by thisgrowth are not offset or mitigated, the South Coast will quickly beginto experience a net increase in emissions throughout the basin.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>FIP Emission Inventory.</T3> The FIP emission inventory would givean indication of what sources would be able to provide additional reductionsand would provide an overall baseline against which the adequacy of thecontrol strategy is judged. The FIP emission inventory would include VOC,NO<T2>x</T2>, and CO.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EPA would need to establish a base year inventory; a projected inventoryfor future years with no new control measures; and a series of projectedcontrol strategy inventories. This would involve the identification ofsources; data collection on stationary source production levels; estimationof traffic volumes; a calculation of emissions for each mobile and stationarysource category; and a determination of growth factors for each sourceor source category. This effect would require extensive cooperation fromthe SCAQMD, SCAG, ARB, and the California Department of Transportation(Caltrans) since these agencies are typically the source for emissionsdata.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the purposes of the greater than five year plan, EPA would usea 1987 base year emission inventory. This emission inventory is alreadyin preparation, and a final draft could be ready as soon as December 1989.Due to limited time, the five-year FIP would use the 1983 inventory.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To be consistent with EPA's proposed post-1987 policy, some revisionsto the South Coast's 1987 base year inventory are necessary. The inventorywould have to be revised to include all sources which emit more than 10tons per year. Also, the inventory area would need to be expanded to includesources within a 25 mile boundary of the Basin and additional source categoriessuch as treatment, storage, and disposal facilities of hazardous materialsand publicly owned water and sewage treatment facilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The projected inventory would take into account existing control measuresand expected growth in the South Coast. To be consistent with the proposedpost-1987 policy, EPA will project the inventory over five years (1992).The inventories would then be gridded in preparation as input into theUrban Airshed Model (see discussion below).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The quantified emission reductions from the federal control strategiesmust be allocated to each of the emission inventory categories to producea series of projected control strategy inventories. Initially, EPA wouldproject the emission reductions over the first five years, then updateevery three years. To remain consistent with the proposed post-1987 policy,an 80 percent control effectiveness factor would apply to the inventorycontrol categories.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed post-1987 ozone/CO policy give states one year to producea base year emission inventory. EPA's requirements under a FIP might rangebetween having to do an entire inventory to only having to do a part, dependingupon the selection of the base year and the status of any work alreadydone by the state and local agencies. EPA would have to rely heavily oncontractor assistance for all phases of inventory preparation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">B. Determination of Emission Reduction Requirements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Ozone Modeling. </T3>There are two modeling techniques recognized byEPA for ozone evaluations and demonstrations of attainment: the EmpiricalKinetics Modeling Approach (EKMA) and the Urban Airshed Model (UAM). UAMis the preferred model for ozone control strategy evaluations, but is morecomplex and expensive to run than EKMA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EKMA simulates the full range of atmospheric chemical reactions involvedin ozone formation, but employs a very simplistic treatment of transport,mixing, and dispersion of the reacting pollutant species. The advantagesof EKMA are: (1) That it requires only a limited amount of aerometric inputdata; (2) it does not require extensive computer resources; and (3) itcan provide a fixed VOC emission reduction target necessary to reach attainment.It cannot, on the other hand, be used to evaluate the impact of the spatialvariability of emissions, the spatial distribution of ozone, or multi-dayeffects during ozone episodes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The UAM is a three dimensional grid-based model which utilizes thesame set of chemical reactions as EKMA, but employs a much more rigoroustreatment of transport and dispersion. The primary disadvantage to usingthis model is that it is more costly. It requires detailed, three dimensionaldata, considerable effort to assemble and input the aerometric and emissionsdata, and extensive computer resources.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The aerometric and emissions database has been assembled and UAM analyseshave been performed by the SCAQMD. Therefore, EPA intends to base its controlstrategy and attainment analyses on UAM results. EPA would resort to anEKMA analysis only if, by Court order, EPA must promulgate the FIP in avery short time frame, or as discussed below, the SCAQMD modeling analysesor database are found unusable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Ideally, EPA would build upon the South Coast modeling efforts. Ifproblems are discovered with the model or the data, EPA, or an EPA contractor,will work with the SCAQMD and/or conduct the modeling itself. If seriousflaws are found in the SCAQMD's modeling analyses or input data, then EPAmay resort to an EKMA analysis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Two types of modeling analyses will be undertaken: sensitivity andcontrol strategy. Sensitivity analyses will verify that the model is accuratelydepicting the physics and chemistry of the basin and will provide a roughapproximation of the types and magnitudes of emission reduction necessaryto attain the NAAQS. The control strategy analysis will be more specificin terms of what types of input parameter changes are analyzed. It is importantto note that peak ozone concentrations will not react dramatically to individualcontrol measures. The analysis will evaluate the impact on ozone concentrationsof a large group of control measures, with a fairly large overall emissionreduction associated with them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some of the specific types of analyses which would be performed arethe following:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Attainment Demonstration. </T3>The primary analysis needed is the determinationof the level of emission reduction necessary to attain the ozone standard.The suggested approach, as outlined by EPA, is to determine the level ofVOC reductions, in the absence of NO<T2>X</T2> reductions, necessary to reach the standard. Then, if the VOCto NO<T2>X</T2> ratio in the nonattainment area is greater than 10 to 1, theeffects of NO<T2>X</T2> control on the maximum ozone concentrations will be evaluatedto determine the overall level of VOC reductions necessary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the case of the South Coast Basin, PM-10 and NO<T2>2</T2> ambient levels are also in excess of the standard. The SouthCoast draft plan proposes major reductions in NO<T2>X</T2> emissions as necessary particularly for attainment of the PM-10standard. EPA would need to take into account the NO<T2>X</T2> reductions required by the South Coast. Those reductions willaffect ozone attainment, and will make the ozone attainment analyses morecomplex.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Spatial Effects. </T3>The initial precursor reduction targets willbe based on an overall basin reduction level. When actual controls areimplemented, some controls may only apply to certain geographic locations.If certain source types are only located in one area of the basin, controlsapplied to those sources may have different effects on the ozone concentrationsthan similar controls applied elsewhere in the Basin.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Baseline Changes. </T3>As population patterns shift within the basin,the spatial and temporal distribution of emissions may change, especiallyvehicle miles traveled (VMT) and associated emissions. Such changes couldaffect the attainment demonstration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Maintenance of the Standard. </T3>The modeling must demonstrate maintenanceas well as attainment of the NAAQS. Future year projected inventories willbe used for this maintenance demonstration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Carbon Monoxide Modeling. </T3>CO impacts occur on both an urban scaleand a microscale. The overall buildup of pollutants on a large scale definesan urban scale impact, while high, but more transient, levels of pollutantsnear a roadway are considered microscale impacts. Most CO problems arethe result of a combination of both types of impacts; however, the CO nonattainmentproblem in the South Coast basin primarily involves a large urban scalecomponent. Therefore, an attainment demonstration for the basin will requireurban scale modeling.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Although the UAM was developed primarily for ozone applications, itcan also be used for evaluating relatively inert pollutants, such as CO.It has been successfully used for this purpose in Denver, Colorado, andPhoenix, Arizona. Because of the complex meteorology and disparate emissionpatterns in the South Coast basin, the model would be appropriate for usethere as well.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At this time, only proportional rollback procedures have been usedin the analysis of CO in the South Coast basin. Therefore, CO airshed modelingwill require assembling an appropriate aerometric and emissions database.EPA intends to construct the CO FIP attainment demonstration based on theUAM unless time and resource contraints disallow its use. In that event,EPA's analysis must use rollback modeling.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">C. Selection of Control Measures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Before being selected for inclusion in a plan, measures must be evaluatedfor their emission reduction potential, costs, technical and administrativefeasibility, and social and political impacts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The evaluation process is expected to take considerable time and resources,and will involve contractor assistance and the input of numerous outsideagencies and affected industries. The evaluation of measures is normallyperformed by the state and local agencies; however, under a FIP, EPA wouldassume this responsibility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The selection process is also typically handled by the state and localagencies, with little federal input aside from measures mandated by theClean Air Act, such as inspection and maintenance (I/M) or Reasonably AvailableControl Technology. Again, under a FIP, EPA would have the legal responsibilityfor selecting measures which are sufficient to accomplish the goal forattaining and maintaining the standard in the required time period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">D. Preparation of the FIP</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After all the data have been collected, analyses conducted, and measuresselected, EPA would assemble the results into a usable form. This entireprocess would be documented and represented in the form of selected measuresand regulations, and a description of how those measures will enable thestandard to be attained and maintained. This is the draft implementationplan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A major portion of the effort involved in preparing a plan would bethe development of the regulations needed to implement those selected controlmeasures which are in addition to measures currently approved. Regulationsneed to be technically defensible and legally enforceable. This will requireconsiderable effort, expertise, and time, especially for measures whichaddress less traditional source categories and controls.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">E. Adoption of the Plan</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The final state in the preparation of a plan is the process of publicreview, formal approval, and adoption or promulgation. The purpose of theadoption process is the same for a SIP and a FIP, that is, to provide allinterested parties an opportunity to examine the control strategy chosenas well as the technical and legal basis for the strategy, and to makethe plan a legally enforceable document. However, the process is somewhatdifferent for a FIP because of the necessity to conform to federal proceduralrequirements. EPA would be required to publish a summary of the FIP's demonstrationof attainment and draft control measures in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>provide for a public comment period, and holdformal public hearings. A final <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice would contain the final control measuresand responses to public comments. EPA regional offices are primarily responsiblefor drafting <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices, holding public hearings, and obtainingpublic comment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">II. Implementing a Plan</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After a plan has been prepared and promulgated, it must be implemented.Implementation is an ongoing process of administering programs to achieveand maintain compliance with the control measures set forth in the plan.The following activities are encountered in the implementation of a plan:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Source Permitting, Testing, and Inspection</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. Enforcement</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. Effectiveness evaluation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The implementation phase is critical, as it, along with the qualityof the planning effort, determines how effective the plan is. As in thecase of plan preparation, the responsibility for implementing a FIP restswith EPA. While EPA cannot legally require another agency to implementFIP control measures, it would hope that state and local air agencies wouldwant to be involved.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">A. Source Permitting, Testing, and Inspection</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The process of implementing the measures in a plan requires that thecompliance status of the various stationary and mobile sources be determined,corrected when necessary, and maintained. Ideally, a FIP would build fromthe existing state rules which have been approved, adding federal measureswhere necessary but leaving the state or local measures in place. Implementationwould then be shared between the state and local agencies and EPA. Compliancedetermination inspection could be a cooperative venture also; however,since sources subject to federal measures would be operating under federallyissued permits, enforcement actions probably would be carried out at thefederal level.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The task of determining compliance varies with the nature of the source.Stationary sources such as manufacturing facilities, industrial plants,and gasoline terminals require emissions testing and visual inspectionof stack emission points, probable non-stack or fugitive emissions points,and production and control equipment. Mobile source measures require notonly emission testing and visual inspection, as with an I/M program, butmore non-traditional techniques as well, in order to gauge compliance withcontrol measures such as reduced fuel volatility, oxygenated fuels, gasolinerationing, parking restrictions, and mandatory ridesharing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">B. Enforcement</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Enforcement is the process of compelling sources to comply, generallythrough actual or threatened legal action. As previously mentioned, enforcementof federal measures would mean that EPA would have the responsibility forinitiating action against sources operating out of compliance with thosemeasures. While EPA routinely conducts enforcement activities against largeemitters, these activities are limited. Under a FIP, EPA's enforcementrole would expand significantly in the affected area.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">C. Plan Tracking</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Essential to the FIP process is a program to monitor how measuresare being implemented and if emission reductions are occurring as scheduledand committee to assure attainment of the NAAQS. Reports on the plan'simplementation status must be timely and made public. EPA could promulgatea plan provision for such a tracking program. This program would includeemission quantification techniques, required resources, and time framesfor completing the analysis. Quarterly reports would document current controlmeasures development, adoption and implementation, and how they would providethe quantitative analysis necessary to document emission changes. Bothquarterly and annual reports would be distributed to the public. EPA wouldrescind this measure if the SCAQMD and SCAG adopt such a provision in theirSIP and show evidence of sufficient staff and financial resources for implementation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-28036 Filed 12-6-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
