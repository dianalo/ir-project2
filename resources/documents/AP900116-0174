Nearly a half-million furs and leather products, includingpurses, belts and women's shoes, were destroyed in 15 states inBrazil's largest burning of valuable skins in 20 years, saidFernando Cesar Mesquita, president of the Brazilian Institute ofthe Environment and Renewable Resources.   In Rio de Janeiro, troops with flame throwers torched about100,000 jaguar, crocodile, monkee, deer, cobra and wolf skinsvalued at $4 million as journalists, ecologists and federalauthorities watched.   ``This is to show people we mean business and to teach them torespect the environment,'' Mesquita said in a telephone interviewfrom Brasilia, the capital.   Most of the skins were confiscated from Brazilian and foreignships and planes destined for United States, Canada, Asia andEurope, he said.   In one raid, 70,000 skins were seized as they were unloaded atthe Narita International Airport in Japan, Mesquita said.   He said federal police are searching for a Japanese man believedto have arranged the shipment of 40,000 rare Amazonian animal skinsto Tokyo.   ``One of the problems is that it's sometimes difficult to knowthe difference between a lion skin and jaguar's,'' said Mesquita.``You don't know if what shows up in stores is contraband or not.''   He said the burning symbolized a renewed government effort tostop poachers and preserve Brazil's tropical forests and thevariety of plant and animal species unique to the jungle.   Since the late 1970s, at least 5 percent of the2-million-square-mile Amazonian rain forest has been cut and burnedby locals trying to make a living farming in the region, thegovernment says.   In that time, the number of animal, reptile and insect speciesthreatened by extinction has risen from 83 to 250, according to thelatest figures from last year, he said.   ``People need to know what is happening to our fauna,'' saidMesquita. ``Law enforcement is far below what is needed.''</TEXT></DOC>
