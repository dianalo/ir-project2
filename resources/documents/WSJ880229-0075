Yet the contractor dragged this charming man into court. &quot;Unfortunately, he cheated me out of $500,000,&quot; Mr. Lensi says.    Mr. Daly denies that, and accuses the contractor of vast cost overruns and shoddy workmanship. But Mr. Lensi isn't the only one unsettled by dealings with Mr. Daly, the chairman of Hemdale Film Corp. All over Hollywood, the soft-spoken, sadeyed Mr. Daly is described as a kind of cuddly barracuda who is murder to do business with, a man so loath to pay and so frequently sued that some have demanded escrow arrangements before dealing with him.    &quot;If John Daly was found murdered,&quot; fumes Tom Fox, who produced &quot;Return of the Living Dead&quot; for Hemdale, &quot;there would be 7,000 suspects.&quot;    That Mr. Daly -- who denies having ever cheated anyone -- runs a thriving movie business suggests the desperation lurking just beneath the surface in Hollywood. The former amateur boxer and British tax-shelter purveyor has made himself the local bank of last resort: Nearly every film project that is brought to him has been rejected by the major studios, and often the minor ones too.    As it happens, Mr. Daly has good taste, and many of his picks have artistic merit. He says he looks for passion, both in scripts and in people. With his instincts and a voracious appetite for work, he has made closely held Hemdale into perhaps Hollywood's foremost &quot;boutique&quot; movie company. When he has gotten into a scrap, he has shown an uncanny knack for landing on his feet.    At least until now. In January, Hemdale agreed to pay Vestron Video Inc. a whopping $15.7 million to settle allegations that it reneged on a contract to give Vestron the video rights to two hit movies -- &quot;Platoon&quot; and &quot;Hoosiers&quot; -- and instead resold them to a different firm for twice the price. The bitter legal fight also cost Hemdale a shot at going public.    Mr. Daly insists he didn't do anything wrong. But as Vestron executives see it, his use of litigation to play by his own rules finally backfired. When sued over business deals, Mr. Daly often countersues and ends up paying less in out-of-court settlements than he might have been contractually liable for.    Mr. Daly, who is 50, grew up in London, a high-school dropout who was the son of a boxer. While learning the insurance business in the 1960s he met David Hemmings, then a struggling actor, during a dart game in a London pub. The two pooled #100 and their names to found Hemdale, which prospered offering tax shelters and talent-management to the entertainment business.    Mr. Hemmings, who went on to star in &quot;Blow-Up&quot; and now is a producer as well as actor, later sold his interest. He says complaints that Hemdale doesn't always account for funds or pay on time depict &quot;a truthful pattern of behavior.&quot; Of Mr. Daly, who remains his friend, he says: &quot;I know a lot of people think of him as slippery.&quot;    About 10 years ago Mr. Daly moved Hemdale to Los Angeles, and today he works at the center of a vortex of ringing phones and fast-moving aides in a house-turned-office off the Sunset Strip. Though rich and increasingly powerful, he is unpretentious in appearance, and some friends say he goes out of his way to help people. Talent agent Robert Littman, for instance, tells of once getting an actor a role in a Hemdale film, only to lose the five-figure commission on a technicality to the actor's European agent. &quot;When John heard about it, he sent me the equivalent of the commission,&quot; Mr. Littman says.    &quot;I have John at my house at every dinner party I give,&quot; he adds. &quot;Except when I have people who hate him.&quot;    Mr. Daly clearly possesses the power of persuasion. Promoting the 1974 Muhammad Ali-George Foreman fight in Zaire, he got its government to put up most of the purse; Zaire ultimately lost more than $4 million on the fight, he says. In another example, such a normally savvy Hollywood veteran as David Knopf says he worked for Mr. Daly without getting a signed contract; now he is suing, claiming in court that Hemdale owes his firm $269,131 for marketing services on &quot;The Terminator.&quot;    Hemdale's biggest hit has been &quot;Platoon,&quot; winner of the Academy Award for best picture of 1986. Made for about $6 million, the scathing Vietnam drama grossed $138 million in the U.S. Its director, Oliver Stone (whose latest hit is &quot;Wall Street&quot;), praises Mr. Daly for taking chances on such risky films as his earlier &quot;Salvador,&quot; about terror in Central America. &quot;He's always been straight with me,&quot; Mr. Stone says. &quot;He gave me a shot on 'Salvador' when no one else would. He backed 'Platoon' to the hilt even when 'Salvador' wasn't a big hit.&quot;    Yet Mr. Stone acknowledges he wasn't paid for &quot;Platoon&quot; until last fall. Hemdale bought out his interest for an estimated $8.5 million after protracted negotiations.    Some say Mr. Daly has begun to fancy himself a creative expert as well as money man, refusing the right of &quot;final cut&quot; to directors. They cite &quot;Made in the USA,&quot; a Hemdale-backed film about a cross-country car-stealing binge by four youths from towns being wrecked by environmental polluters. Mr. Daly decided to edit it himself to stress the action and comedy, rejecting director Ken Friedman's own cut emphasizing the social consequences of pollution.    Critics who saw both at film festivals generally preferred the Friedman version, but Mr. Daly has remained adamant that his is the only acceptable one, and it will shortly be test-marketed in a few small cities. Mr. Friedman says he was upset enough by the changes to substitute a pseudonym for his name as screenwriter in the movie's credits, though he is retaining directing credit.    The film's producer, Charles Roven, has also found dealing with Mr. Daly unsettling. &quot;It's very difficult to pick your way through John's dialogue to find out what's real and what's not real,&quot; Mr. Rovwn says. &quot;I don't think he knows what the meaning of making a deal is.&quot;    Mr. Daly disputes that, though he concedes that a British justice once called him &quot;fundamentally dishonest&quot; -- and that wags in England used to refer to Hemdale as Hemlock. The truth, he says, is simply that his company is &quot;very sharp. We're passionate about the pictures, but we're not stupid.&quot;    One way or another, lawsuits often result. In one filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, Greencash Productions Ltd., which helped finance &quot;Living Dead,&quot; accuses Hemdale of concealing funds and of breach of contract. In another suit, &quot;Platoon&quot; producer Arnold Kopelson contends he and his companies are owed more than $25 million as their share of the profits. &quot;Terminator&quot; producer Barry Plumley sued for payment, then took a cash settlement &quot;rather than continue to hassle it,&quot; says his lawyer, James A. Dumas Jr., who adds that &quot;John Daly is just kind of a wild man.&quot;    Not everyone sues, of course. Jay Weston, a veteran producer, didn't. But after fighting with Mr. Daly over an unmade movie, he says, &quot;I can't ever entertain in my life wanting to do business again with Mr. Daly or Hemdale. It was one of the worst experiences I've had in 35 years in the film business.&quot;    Court papers in &quot;Platoon&quot; producer Kopelson's suit include a private investigator's report asserting that &quot;large amounts&quot; of money are transferred periodically from certain Hemdale bank accounts to the Bank of Zurich in Switzerland, which has strong bank-secrecy laws. Mr. Daly denies having any Swiss accounts and insists all the suits have been groundless. He dismisses Mr. Kopelson in particular as &quot;stark, raving mad.&quot; He says Mr. Kopelson isn't owed anything like $25 million and contends the producer's real aim is to force Hemdale to buy out his interest on favorable terms. Mr. Kopelson denies that.    The battle over video rights to &quot;Platoon&quot; has been Mr. Daly's biggest and most costly. It cost Hemdale a chance to go public by merging with a shell company, and it may have reduced the film's value on videocassette, since the picture was out of the public eye for months.    The dispute goes back to August 1985, when Hemdale signed a contract giving Vestron exclusive U.S. video rights to &quot;Hoosiers,&quot; a film about a small-town basketball coach. In April 1986, Hemdale signed a second contract granting Vestron video rights to &quot;Platoon.&quot; Vestron agreed to pay Hemdale about $6 million for both.    But once it was clear &quot;Platoon&quot; would be a hit, Vestron executives allege in their suit, Mr. Daly and his aides at Hemdale began to balk at turning over the pictures. Vestron chairman Austin Furst said in a sworn deposition that Hemdale treated the whole thing as a joke: &quot;The attitude being taken was one of frivolity and hilarity.&quot; He testified that Hemdale's negotiating style was to obscure the matter with an ever-changing list of issues and players.    While putting off Vestron, Mr. Daly went ahead and sold the disputed video rights to Time Inc.'s HBO Video for $15 million. Mr. Daly contends he was justified in breaking his agreement with Vestron because it had failed to make an $825,000 payment by the due date; Vestron says it was entitled to the films first. But Mr. Daly concedes that if Vestron had been willing to renegotiate the pact on more favorable terms, he would have turned over the films. (The settlement provides -- besides the $15.7 million payment -- that Home Box Office will distribute the two movies until September, when Vestron gets the rights back for 10 years.)    For all his disputes, Mr. Daly is often described as the most cordial of men. &quot;Living Dead&quot; producer Fox, while describing Mr. Daly as &quot;the most degrading person to do business with,&quot; gets practically smarmy on the subject of his personal attributes. Mr. Daly, he says, is &quot;charming, lovely -- the nicest guy in town.&quot;    &quot;There is nobody more charismatic or a better salesman than John Daly,&quot; adds former Hemdale executive Mark Siler. &quot;He just oozes charm.&quot;    No one can argue with Hemdale's success. Thanks mainly to &quot;Platoon,&quot; Hemdale earned $7.1 million on revenue of $46.3 million in the first half of 1987. For all of 1986 it earned $2.3 million on revenue of $20.9 million. And its &quot;The Last Emperor,&quot; has just been nominated for nine Academy Awards, including best picture. Mr. Daly's latest coup came when Tri-Star Pictures, now part of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., agreed to distribute 15 Hemdale films over the next three years. Tri-Star president David Matalon says his company hasn't had any problems with Hemdale and doesn't expect to.    Mr. Daly says his continuing success is proof his critics are wrong. &quot;If people don't want to deal with us, they don't have to,&quot; he says. &quot;But the phone never stops ringing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
