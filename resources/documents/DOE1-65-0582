Based on the known lanthanide chalcogenide halides,they focused their investigation on the sulfur-based compounds. Consistentwith the scarcity of transplutonium elements, they developed an originalmicroscale preparation of the ternary compounds AnSI (An = {sup 242}Pu,{sup 243}Am, {sup 248}Cm). The reaction scheme is: An{sub 2}O{sub 3}(or AnO{sub 2}) {yields} AnBr{sub 3} {yields}AnI{sub 3} {yields} AnSI.All products are examined by X-ray powder diffraction and solid statespectroscopy.</TEXT></DOC>
