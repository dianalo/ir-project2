(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Multiscan HG Sony has a remarkable reputation for sharp televisions as wellas video and Macintosh monitors based on the amazing Trinitron picture tube,which uses in-line guns and a mask with vertical slots rather than circulardots.andP;  In the PC community, reaction to Sony's monitors has been moreequivocal, though the 13-inch Multiscan HG may change that.andP;  This $1,095color display proved to be an excellent choice for presentation graphics andcolor desktop publishing, though less desirable for CAD.andM;More compact than its Sony predecessors with similar screen sizes, theMultiscan HG's pale-beige plastic case tapers toward the rear, measuring 14by 13,75 by 16 inches (HWD), including the built-in tilt/swivel base.andP;  Its50-MHz bandwidth pushes its resolution limit to 1,024 by 768 pixels,interlaced or noninterlaced; it accepts horizontal frequencies in the range28 to 50 KHz and vertical frequencies of 50 to 87 Hz.andP;  It is compatible withIBM's 8514/A display adapter.andM;Only analog inputs are accepted by the lonely 9-pin D connector on the unit'srear panel; it will lock to images based on either separate sync, compositesync, or sync on green.andP;  The input lines are permanently terminated.andP;  Theinput cable is optional; a 48-inch 15- to 9-pin cable costs $25.95.andM;Trinitrons look and test differently than ordinary dot matrix picture tubes.andO;The slotted design means that nothing limits the spread of horizontal lines,while vertical lines bump into the mask area between the slots.andP;  As a result,horizontal lines are apparently brighter than vertical lines--an effectvirtually invisible on images with an illuminated background, but readilyapparent on CAD wireframes.andP;  Trinitron tubes also differ from conventionalscreens in that they are curved in only one dimension.andP;  The Trinitron face iscylindrical rather than spherical, though nevertheless quite convex.andM;On our tests, the Multiscan HG drew wide lines (over 20 mils) despite havinga very fine, .26-mm.andP;  dot pitch.andP;  Subjectively, however, the Multiscan HGlooked sharp; the wider lines smooth over the separations between pixels.andM;Controls on the Multiscan HG are minimal.andP;  Brightness and contrastthumbwheels are located under the left-front edge of the screen, a power-onpush button on the right.andP;  On the left side is a recessed panel for thehorizontal and vertical size and positioning controls, as well as a switchmarked &quot;Lock/Adj.&quot; &quot;Lock&quot; sets the Multiscan HG for full IBM 8514compatibility with image sizing determined by sync polarity.andP;  Slide theswitch to &quot;Adj&quot; and you can fine-tune the size of any image using thecontrols.andM;Documentation is scant: ten pages in English duplicated in French.andP;  Althougha timing chart is included, the pin-out of the proprietary 9-pin videoconnector is not documented.andP;  In fact, the bulk of the thin manual is devotedto a listing of the control functions and instructions for using thetilt/swivel base.andP;  Sony warrants the Trinitron tube for two years and theother Multiscan HG parts for one.andP;  Labor is covered for only 90 days.andP;  TheJapan-made monitor is FCC Class B certified.andM;Trinitron monitors have a look all their own, onw that defies quantification.andO;If you do desktop publishing, you'll probably love this Sony.andP;  For otherapplications, you may prefer a bigger screen that gives equal light tovertical and horizontal lines.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
