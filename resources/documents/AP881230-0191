(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For students working in a miniature factory atthe University of Missouri-Rolla, the future of American business isnow.   ``When our students go into industry, they will havestate-of-the-art knowledge'' that will affect decisions aboutexpanding the role of robots and automated machines in theworkplace, said Sema Alptekin, designer of the futuristic businesslaboratory.   Ms. Alptekin is a mechanical and industrial engineer who directsthe university's computer-integrated manufacturing and packaginglaboratory.   The lab, established two years ago at a cost of $120,000, is theonly project of its kind in the state, and one of the more advancedsuch programs in the country.   Tom Akas of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers said Ms.Alptekin has created ``a model for similar laboratories ... Studentscan see how the factory of the future operates.''   The Society of Manufacturing Engineers has recognized Ms.Alptekin as an Outstanding Young Manufacturing Engineer.   In her lab, a conveyer belt at waist level carries parts fromstorage shelves to a robot that dominates the room like a silent,4-foot metal sentry. The robot is a V-shaped, jointed arm on apivoting base. The arm can be fitted to allow it to grasp, lift andturn objects of differing sizes to suit a variety of tasks. Therobot then swivels to place parts in position at the automated latheor milling machine.   The entire factory would fit inside a basketball half-court. Themachinery is of the type used to make small parts in metal cuttingshops, Ms. Alptekin said.   Students learn to program a computer and automated machineslinked to it in a complete manufacturing operation _ retrieving rawmaterials from the storage shelf unit, which can be programmed tosupply appropriate parts from its inventory; lifting and placing theparts in position with the robot's arm; and shaping parts intofinished products at the lathe.   Students using the lab have designed and produced engraved keychains and intricate mazes and puzzles out of plastic and plexiglass.   But the product is less important than the process. Ms. Alptekinsaid former students have entered fields as disparate as aviationand financial consulting.   In the factory of the future, according to the university'smodel, human chatter will be replaced by the click-clack of machines.   ``Ours is quite unique, it's totally integrated,'' Ms. Alptekinsaid, referring to programming that allows components such as theautomated storage system to ``talk to'' the computer that controlsthe manufacturing process, informing it about the availability ofparts.   Ms. Alptekin said it is this aspect that sets the lab apart evenfrom industries where robots and automated machines have becomealmost commonplace. There, she said, robots perform specific tasksin ``islands of automation,'' but human workers remain responsiblefor keeping inventory and coordinating different aspects of theproduction line.   Ms. Alptekin said automation is widespread in the automobileindustry, but she would like to see it expanded.   ``It should be used in any industry,'' she said. ``It's difficultto justify economically, but if quality is the concern, then it canbe easily justified.   ``At least our students will be aware of the enhancements anddevelopments in this area, and when they make decisions as engineersand managers, they will take this into consideration,'' she said.   A master's candidate analyzed the existing system with an eye toaltering it to create a new product. Ms. Alptekin said the studentidentified what new production components were necessary anddetermined how they could be integrated into the system.   A doctoral candidate is developing computer software that willallow the system to diagnose itself. The system could be programmedto recognize when a component is not working, and then decide toswitch to manufacturing a product that does not involve the disabledcomponent, much as human managers would react.   Graduate student Bob Borchelt said the equipment he is using ison the cutting edge of manufacturing.   ``Truthfully, I can't say that I was expecting this level ofexpertise,'' he said. ``I know that our lab is one of the best ofits kind in an educational institution.''   The lab, like the entire engineering management program, calls oncomputing, mechanical, electrical and chemical skills _ and teamwork.   ``For us, for managers, the entire system is important,'' Ms.Alptekin said.   Ms. Alptekin said she is continually fine-tuning the lab. Thispast year, the original robot was replaced with one able to performmore tasks. She now is considering purchasing a robot with visionsophisticated enough to act as an inspector.   The university spent $30,000 to upgrade lab equipment in 1987. Anestimated $60,000 to $70,000 was earmarked in 1988.   International Business Machines Corp. recently pledged $1.2million in computer equipment and software to the university as partof an IBM program to aid 48 college-based robotics labs across thecountry.   ``Studies show that there's a severe national shortage ofinstructional materials in this growing and critical area,'' saidAndy Russell, a spokesman for IBM. ``IBM will benefit because wewill be helping to train the (computer-integrated manufacturing)workers and decision makers of today and tomorrow.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for AMs Monday Jan. 2</NOTE></DOC>
