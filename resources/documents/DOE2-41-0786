Details are presentedon the fuel properties of such slurries, potential supplies and reserves,and potential consumption. It is estimated that adding 1.1 billion tonsof coal to present proven oil reserves will extend oil resources by 7years at 1970 rates of consumption. Adding the total recoverable 4.5billion tons of high-rank western coal to the oil that is assumed tobe recoverable will extend the oil resources by 30 years. Also discussedare a number of strategies to conserve oil resources, some offering improvedefficiency, with which the coal-in-oil concept must compete. These includeuse of the combined gas turbine/steam cycle in thermal power generation,coal gasification, coal liquefaction, fluidized-bed coal combustion,improved combustion processes, and magnetohydrodynamic power. 1 ref.,5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
