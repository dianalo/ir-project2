No. 07/172,409, filed Mar. 24,      1988, now abandoned. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAR>  The present invention relates to novel pharmaceutical preparations adapted      for intranasal administration and to a process for preparing such      preparations. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  While non-invasive medication, such as oral or rectal administration of a      drug is undoubtedly most convenient to the patient, parenteral drug      delivery is usually regarded as being the most effective. In particular,      drugs which are inactivated in or poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal      tract and drugs which are subject to extensive first pass hepatic      metabolism following oral administration are usually administered      parenterally. </PAR><PAR>  There are obvious inconveniences associated with parenteral drug      administration, such as the need for sterile delivery devices, pain and      irritation caused by reiterated injections and the potential risk of      infection. Therefore, alternative means of drug delivery, equalling      parenteral administration in the sense that first pass metabolism is      circumvented, have been sought. One such potentially promising alternative      is drug administration via the nasal route. However, just as is the case      with other methods for non-invasive medication, the bioavailability of a      drug after intranasal administration is largely, unpredictable, depending      inter alia on the chemical nature of the drug. </PAR><PAR>  Thus it is known that progesterone and propranolol are absorbed from the      nasal cavity in a manner providing blood levels almost equal to      intraveneous administration. </PAR><PAR>  Other examples of intranasal formulations of pharmaceutically active agents      with molecular weights up to about 1 kD are known, for example      compositions containing ergopeptide alkaloids dissolved in aqueous ethanol      administered as aerosols (Swiss Patent No. 636,011), salts of      pharmaceutically active amines with fatty acids (Canadian Patent No.      988,852) and catecholamine suspended in a fatty acid (or ester) emulsified      with polyoxyethylene (European Patent Publication No. 0 160 501 A). </PAR><PAR>  Over the last decades a variety of (mainly synthetic) polypetide drugs have      been developed. In general, polypeptides have been administered      parenterally due to incomplete absorption from and digestive instability      in the alimentary canal. This is probably the reason why in particular      studies of the nasal delivery of polypeptides have been intensified during      recent years. It has been found that while some smaller polypeptides (up      to about 10 amino acid residues) may be reasonably well absorbed      intranasally from simple aqueous formulations, generally the nasal      bioavailability of larger polypeptides becomes both incomplete and      variable, and increasingly so with increasing molecular weight (for      review, see L. Illum: Archiv for Pharmaci og Chemi 94 (1987), 127-135). </PAR><PAR>  With a view to overcoming the disadvantages encountered particularly with      nasal delivery compositions containing larger polypeptides, the additional      incorporation of a variety of biocompatible absorption promoting agents or      so-called enhancers has been devised. </PAR><PAR>  In this respect reference is made to European Patent Publication No. 0 111      841 A, disclosing the absorption enhancing effect of a bile acid and to      U.S. Pat. No. 4,476,116, using chelating agents such as EDTA. </PAR><PAR>  Nasal formulations adapted to insulin delivery would naturally be highly      preferred by the insulin dependent diabetic patient to the presently      available preparations for parenteral administration provided that the      insulin is absorbed to a reasonably effective and constant extent from the      nasal cavity. A variety of absorption enhancing agents, mainly      surfactants, have been devised for such formulations. </PAR><PAR>  Ionic as well as non-ionic surfactant enhancers, such as bile acid salts      and polyoxyethylene higher alcohol ethers are disclosed in British Patent      No. 1,527,605 while the use of a specific polyoxyethylene higher alcohol      ether, namely polyoxyethylene-9 lauryl ether is described in: R. Salzman      et al., New England J. of Med. 312 (1985), 1078-1084. Other enhancers, for      example salts of taurodihydrofusidic acid, are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.      4,548,922. </PAR><PAR>  The chemical structure of enhancers known heretofore deviate considerably      from those of known constituents of cellular membranes, including those of      the nasal cavity. This feature could possibly explain their general      proneness to cause nasal irritation or even permanent damage to the nasal      membrane, particularly during chronic administration. On this background      enhancers more akin to other physiologically occurring surfactants, such      as phospholipids could be contemplated. However, according to the data      disclosed in British Patent No. 1,527,605 (supra) the phospholipids in a      commonly supplied long chain lecithin mixture have no detectable      absorption promoting effect in insulin containing nasal formulations. </PAR><PAR>  It has now surprisingly been found that medium chain length      phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines substantially promote      the intranasal absorption of pharmaceutically active compounds, in      particular of polypeptides, without damaging or irritating the nasal      mucosa. The intranasal absorption is further enhanced from formulations      wherein a fatty oil, for example a vegetable oil, is admixed with the      phospolipid. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  According to its first aspect the present invention provides a preparation      for intranasal administration comprising a pharmaceuticaly active agent      and an absorption enhancing system comprising at least one phospholipid of      the general formula I      ##STR1##      wherein R' and R&quot; are identical or different, each selected from the group      consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkylcarbonyl, alkenylcarbonyl and      alkadienyl-, alkatrienyl- or alkatetraenylcarbonyl containing up to a      total of 14 carbon atoms, provided that both R' and R&quot; are not hydrogen,      and R'&quot; represents a hydrophilic moiety selected from the group consisting      of 2-(trimethylammonio)ethyl, 2-aminoethyl, 2-carboxy-2-aminoethyl,      2,3-dihydroxypropyl and pentahydroxycyclohexyl, thus comprising      phosphatidyl derivatives of choline (lecithins), ethanolamine, glycerol,      serine and inositols, respectively. Optionally, but preferably, the      absorption enhancing system also comprises a fatty oil in admixture with      the phospholipid(s). </PAR><PAR>  According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a      process for making a preparation for intranasal administration, which      method comprises dispersing at least one phospholipid of the general      formula I, optionally, but preferably admixed with a fatty oil, in a      liquid or solid diluent together with the pharmaceutically active agent      either in solution or in a powdery state, which diluent may optionally      comprise ancillary pH-buffering, preserving and osmotic pressure      controlling agents. </PAR></BSUM><DETD> <PAC>  PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS AND DETAILED DESCRIPTION THEREOF </PAC><PAR>  A preferred subclass of compounds of formula I is compounds, wherein R' and      R&quot; are each alkylcarbonyl. A further preferred subclass of compounds of      formula I is compounds, wherein R'&quot; represents 2-(trimethylammonio)ethyl,      such compounds being known as lecithins. A still further preference is for      compounds of formula I, wherein R' and R&quot; each represent alkylcarbonyl or      alkyl with from about 4 carbon atoms, preferably not more than 12 carbon      atoms. The most preferred subclass of compounds of formula I is compounds      wherein R' and R&quot; each represent nonylcarbonyl. </PAR><PAR>  A preferred preparation of this invention is one containing a mixture of      two phospholipids of formula I, preferably in proportions by weight of      from 1:10 to 10:1, more preferred from 1:2 to 2:1. One of these two      phospholipids may conveniently be a compound wherein R' and R&quot; both are      octanoyl, decanoyl or lauroyl. The other of these two phosphollipids may      conveniently be a compound wherein one of the two substituents R' and R&quot;      is hydrogen and the other of the two substituents R' and R&quot; is octanoyl,      decanoyl or lauroyl (dodecanoyl). </PAR><PAR>  Examples of preferred compounds of formula I are: </PAR><PA0>  dioctanoyl L-.alpha.-phosphatidylcholine, </PA0><PA0>  dioctyl-O-L-.alpha.-phosphatidylcholine, </PA0><PA0>  didecanoyl L-.alpha.-phosphatidylcholine, </PA0><PA0>  didecyl-O-L-.alpha.-phosphatidylcholine, </PA0><PA0>  decyl-O-L-.alpha.-lysophatidylcholine </PA0><PA0>  dilauroyl L-.alpha.-phosphatidylcholine, </PA0><PA0>  lauroyl L-.alpha.-lysophosphatidylcholine. </PA0><PAR>  The preparation of a number of compounds of formula I has been described,      e.g. by E. C. Robles and D. Van Den Berg: Biochim. Biophys.Acta 187      (1969), 520-526, H. K. Mangold and F. Paltauf (Eds.) in: Ether Lipids,      Chapter 3, Acad.Press 1983. Other compounds of formula I can be prepared      by analogous methods. </PAR><PAR>  The fatty oil optionally incorporated into the absorption enhancing system      of this invention is preferably a vegetable oil, more preferably soybean      oil, peanut oil, coconut oil, maize oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, or      mixtures thereof. </PAR><PAR>  In another preferred embodiment of this invention the pharmaceutically      active agent is a polypeptide. One group of preferred polypeptides is      insulin and insulin derivatives, e.g. insulin modified by chemical or      enzymatic methods or by recombinant DNA technology, or mixtures of such      insulins, proinsulin and glucagon. Other preferred polypeptides are      parathyroid hormone, parathyroid hormone antagonist, calcitonin,      vasopressin, renin, prolactin, growth hormone, thyroid stimulating      hormone, corticotropin, corticotropin-releasing factor, follicle      stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, chorionic gonadotropin, atrial      peptides, interferon, tissue plasminogen activator, gammaglobulins, Factor      VII, Factor VIII, growth hormone releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone      releasing hormone, somatostatin and cholecystokinins. </PAR><PAR>  The preparation of this invention may be liquid, e.g. adapted for      administration as a spray or a solid, e.g. a powder acceptable for      snuffing. Liquid preparations, such as those based on aqueous      formulations, will usually include ancillary agents, for example a      pH-buffering system, preferably a buffer such as phosphate, citrate or      acetate buffers, a preservative and an osmotic pressure controlling agent,      e.g. glycerol or sodium chloride. Powder formulations may contain the      pharmaceutically active agent and the absorption enhancing system in      admixture with nasally acceptable powdery diluents or mixtures thereof,      e.g. cellulose or derivatives thereof, for example cellulose ethers or      sodium carboxymethylcellulose, starch, a long chain fatty acid or a salt      thereof, e.g. aluminum stearate, an organic polymer, e.g. of an acrylic      acid derivative or inorganic vehicles, such as talc or diatomaceous earth.      Supplementary addition of water-absorbing polymers, for example      polyethylene glycol or polyvinyl pyrrolidone may be desirable to improve      adhesion of the powder formulation to the nasal mucosa. </PAR><PAR>  Preferred liquid preparations are those in which the diluent is water. Such      preparations may be prepared by dispersing the absorption enhancing system      in the aqueous medium containing the pharmaceutically active agent and      ancillary agents, the dispersion being conducted by any method usually      employed for suspension or emulsification, e.g. ultrasonic treatment.      Adjustment of the aqueous phase to neutrality (i.e. to pH in the range      from about 6.5 to about 8) may be accomplished in any of the preparatory      steps. Preferably, microemulsions are prepared in which the size of the      dispersed particles or droplets is of the order of 10 nm, thereby      facilitating their passage across the nasal mucosa. Such microemulsions      may be sterilized by filtration. The content of phospholipid of formula I      and of fatty oil in preferred formulations of the present invention is in      the range of from 0.01 to 10%, preferably from 0.5 to 5% (w/v), and      0.01-50%, preferably from 0.1 to 10% (w/v), respectively, of the      preparation. Due to the fact that proteases and peptidases are associated      with the nasal mucosa (see R. E. Stratford and V. H. L. Lee: Int. Journ.      Pharmaceutics 30 (1986), 73-82) it may be desirable to incorporate      biocompatible protease and peptidase inhibitors into polypeptide      containing formulations. </PAR><PAR>  The concentration of the pharmaceutically active agent in the preparations      of this invention will of course depend on the particular agent chosen, on      its efficacy, on a comparison of its bioavailability by nasal      administration and by other routes of administration, for example      parenteral injection, and on the desired frequency of administration      combined with the desired single dosage of the formulation. Such      pharmacological data can routinely be obtained by the skilled artisan from      animal experiments, for example in terms of index values, such as those      estimated for insulin preparations in the examples hereinafter provided. </PAR><PAR>  Taking insulin as an example, its concentration in the preparation of this      invention may be in the range of from about 5 to 1000 international units      (I.U.) per ml, preferably from 50 to 500 I.U. per ml. </PAR><PAR>  The insulin preparations of this invention preferably contain bovine,      porcine or human insulin. </PAR><PAR>  An exemplary mode of preparing the insulin preparations of this invention      wherein the diluent is water comprises dissolving insulin, for example      crystalline zinc insulin, for example the highly purified grade of insulin      disclosed in British Patent No. 1,285,023, in water in the presence of an      acid, for example hydrochloric acid. An aqueous solution of a      preservative, for example phenol, an alkyl phenol, such as cresol, or      methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, is prepared separately, optionally also      containing an agent rendering the solution isotonic, such as sodium      chloride or glycerol. Furthermore, the preservative solution may contain a      buffering agent, such as sodium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium acetate      or TRIS (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane) and a protease inhibitor. The      resulting preservative solution is then admixed with the acid insulin      solution followed by addition of a base, for example a sodium hydroxide      solution, to adjust the pH value to neutrality. The phospholipid of      formula I, optionally in admixture with the fatty oil, may be added to the      insulin solution as a solution or an emulsion which is prepared by      dissolving or suspending the phospholipid of formula I in water and and,      if necessary, subjecting any suspension to an ultrasonic treatment before      mixing with the insulin solution. Alternatively the phospholipid solution      or emulsion may, if desired, contain the buffering agent and preservative.      After mixing, the pH value of the insulin preparation may be readjusted to      neutrality. Finally, the resulting insulin solution is made up to the      calculated volume by addition of water. </PAR><PAR>  The preparations of this invention may be used in any dosage dispensing      device adapted for intranasal administration. The device should be      constructed with a view to ascertaining optimum metering accuracy and      compatibility of its constructive elements, such as container, valve and      actuator with the nasal formulation and could be based on a mechanical      pump system, e.g. that of a metered-dose nebulizer, or on a pressurized      aerosol system. The aerosol system requires the propellant to be inert      towards the formulation. Suitable propellants may be selected among such      gases as fluorocarbons, hydrocarbons, nitrogen and dinitrogen oxide or      mixtures thereof. </PAR><PAR>  Further details of practising this invention are furnished by way of the      following examples which, however, should not be construed so as to      imposes any kind of limitation to the scope of this invention. </PAR><PAR>  The insulin starting material used in Examples 1-12 contained about 20 to      30 .mu.g zinc per mg nitrogen. </PAR><PAR>  Soybean oil and peanut oil were purified grades corresponding to those of      U.S.P. XXI and N.F. XVI, respectively. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  772 mg of human insulin were dissolved in 40 ml of 0.02M hydrochloric acid      and 1.6 g of anhydrous glycerol were added. Furthermore, distilled water      was added to 80 ml. The pH value was adjusted to 7.4 with a 0.2M sodium      hydroxide solution 1.0 g of didecanoyl L-.alpha.-phosphatidylcholine was      dissolved in 2 ml of ethanol (96%) and were via a hypodermic syringe      injected into 10 ml of distilled water.
