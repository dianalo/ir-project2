The Moody's downgrades -- which hurt Salomon's prestigeand are likely to raise its borrowing costs -- are the firstMoody's has imposed on a major Wall Street securities firm in1 1/2 years. But Salomon stressed that its &quot;overallliquidity&quot; remains strong and that its backup fundingcapabilities remain sufficient to finance the firm'soperations.</LP><TEXT>   Still, the Moody's action is significant becausesecurities firms depend on billions of dollars in short-termloans to finance their daily operations. Lenders' confidenceand continued funding are vital to their survival.   Meanwhile, Missouri's secretary of state announced anational commission to investigate the bond scandal and itsimpact on bond investors. Among its other legal worries,Salomon probably will have to pay millions of dollars insettlements to retain its brokerage licenses in some states,government lawyers say.   Moody's downgrade affects $7 billion of Salomon'slong-term securities and $6.6 billion in commercial paper.The senior debt rating was downgraded to single-A-3 fromsingle-A-2, dropping the firm below all its major competitorsexcept American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman BrothersHoldings Inc. (also single-A-3) and PaineWebber Group Inc.(recently upgraded to Baa-1). Salomon's rating for commercialpaper-or short-term IOUs used to finance daily operations --was downgraded to Prime-2 from Prime-1.   Moody's said it was concerned about the &quot;legal, financialand business consequences&quot; arising from Salomon's admissionthat it repeatedly submitted unauthorized bids in customers'names at several Treasury market auctions in the past ninemonths. Salomon Chairman John Gutfreund and three other topexecutives resigned after the firm disclosed they had learnedof a single unauthorized bid and failed to tell thegovernment for months.   There could be further downgrades, said Moody's, which iskeeping the Salomon ratings under review. Of particularconcern &quot;is the nature of any criminal charges&quot; and civilactions that may be brought against the firm and its SalomonBrothers Inc. securities unit, Moody's said.   Responding to the Moody's downgrade, Salomon yesterdaysaid the action &quot;will have no significant impact on thefirm's overall liquidity, which remains strong. It may,however, marginally raise our cost of borrowing.&quot; Moody'snoted that Salomon has &quot;professional financial management,adequate capital and healthy liquidity.&quot;   One reason Salomon believes it has sufficient funding isthat commercial paper has long been a small part of itsfinancing. Its $6.6 billion in commercial paper outstandingworld-wide, down from $7.7 billion about two weeks ago,represents less than 6% of the firm's $120 billion in fundingobligations.   The firm has about $1 billion in commercial paper comingdue in the next week, but it isn't any longer issuing suchpaper.   Instead, Salomon is replacing its maturing commercialpaper largely with repurchase agreements backed by securitiesthat Salomon owns, particularly government bonds. That is aless desirable funding strategy because it is far lessflexible and is even shorter-term than commercial paper.These &quot;repos&quot; now account for about $100 billion, or 83% ofthe firm's financing, people familiar with the firm said.   If Salomon replaced all its commercial paper world-widewith more-expensive repurchase agreements for a full year, itwould cost the firm as much as an additional $6.5 million,including operating costs, Salomon officials said.   &quot;The fact is, we haven't had a funding problem and wedon't intend to have a funding problem,&quot; said Donald S.Howard, Salomon's chief financial officer. Added anotherSalomon executive: &quot;It will increase our borrowing costs, butwe're worried about availability -- not price.&quot;   Salomon's other funding alternatives include tapping bankcredit lines and drawing down the $2 billion commercial paperbackup funding the firm has never used. However, a quarter ofthat $2 billion in funds has to be refinanced in September.Salomon so far hasn't been forced to liquidate any of itsassets, but it is expected to pare its balance sheet in thenext few weeks, Salomon executives said.   Despite the importance of the ratings change, analystsnoted that Salomon already has been paying more for itsborrowing since the scandal hit.   &quot;Lenders are already rethinking their commitment withSalomon and customers are already rethinking their tradinglimits,&quot; said John Keefe, a brokerage analyst with LipperAnalytical Securities Corp. &quot;It's already in themarketplace.&quot;   Salomon shares, which had plunged 31% since the scandalbroke Aug. 9, edged up 12.5 cents, to $25.375 a share, inlate New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday. It was thefirst session since the scandal broke that volume didn't topone million shares.   &quot;Everybody did expect this, and that's why the stockwasn't negatively affected,&quot; said Guy Moszkowski, brokerageanalyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. &quot;On thecommercial-paper side, it will have an effect, but not anenormous earnings effect,&quot; the analyst said.   The last securities firm to be downgraded by Moody's wasMerrill Lynch andamp; Co. in January 1990. At the time, Merrill wasdowngraded a notch to single-A-2, which put in on the samelevel as Salomon and several other securities firms. However,Salomon has fallen below Merrill and those other firms withyesterday's downgrade.   Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., another major credit-ratingagency, is also expected to downgrade Salomon's ratings.After the scandal broke earlier this month, Sandamp;P changed thefirm's outlook to negative from stable. Sandamp;P last weekannounced that a downgrade was &quot;probable.&quot;   Government lawyers said that the national commission toprobe Salomon Brothers, announced yesterday by Missouri'ssecretary of state, Roy Blunt, was unusual and couldintensify public pressure on the securities firm. &quot;States arelooking for any possible legal and financial recourse theymay have against Salomon,&quot; Mr. Blunt said. Texas yesterdaybecame the latest state to suspend business with Salomon;Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Connecticut, California andColorado also suspended dealings with the firm in recentweeks.   State securities regulators are also gearing up toinvestigate the firm. As previously reported, the securitiesregulators are expected to organize a task force similar tothe one that helped win $4 million in state settlements fromcollapsed Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   &quot;We owe investors and taxpayers an explanation of the manyquestions that surround the Salomon scandal,&quot; said Mr. Blunt.&quot;Clearly, our investigation will look into any possibleeffects Salomon's practices will have on its broker-dealerlicense&quot; in individual states, Mr. Blunt said.   As expected, Congress set a hearing on the SalomonBrothers scandal for next Wednesday, with Salomon's interimChairman Warren Buffett as the opening witness. Otherscheduled witnesses are Federal Reserve Vice Chairman DavidMullins, New York Fed President Gerald Corrigan, TreasuryAssistant Secretary Jerome Powell and Securities and ExchangeCommission Chairman Richard Breeden.   ---   Michael R.
