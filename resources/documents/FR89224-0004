Theregulation is consistent with the Group III document, ``Control of VolatileOrganic Compound Emissions from Air Oxidation Processes in the SyntheticOrganic Chemical Manufacturing Industry'' (EPA-450/3-84-015).Specifically, Regulation 6.38 requires the use of combustion to reducethe total organic compound emissions to 98 percent by weight or to 20 ppmby volume, or maintenance of a total resource effectiveness index value(TRE) greater than 1.0. The TRE is calculated in accordance with AppendixH of the CTG. Final compliance with the regulation must be demonstratedno later than December 31, 1987.On September 1, 1988 (53 FR 33826), EPA proposed to approve Jefferson CountyAir Pollution Control District Regulation 6.38, ``Standard of Performancefor existing air oxidation processes in synthetic organic chemical manufacturingindustries''.
