Recession, slow air-travel growth and a significantshortage of airline capital for the purchase of new aircraftwill combine to force more carriers to defer or cancelorders, executives of two large leasing concerns agreed ininterviews at an industry conference here. They added thateconomic hardship also may lead more airlines to modify oldjet engines in the existing fleet to run more quietly as acost-cutting alternative until better times arrive.                                                                                                          International Lease Finance Corp., a unit of AmericanInternational Group, New York, projects that Boeing Co.,Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium and McDonnell DouglasCorp. will have to cut production 10% overall in 1993. Thatwould slash total deliveries for the three big concerns to540 from the 600 they would produce at present rates.   And GPA Group PLC, a big Irish leasing concern, predictsthat all makers' deliveries of jetliners with more than 100seats will tumble to 619 in 1994, from last year's 834. The619 number is nearly 17% below what Boeing forecasts for theindustry that year.   GPA and International Lease -- both large-scale customersof the plane manufacturers, but companies that don'tnecessarily suffer in an airline slump when many carrierschoose to lease rather than buy new aircraft -- agreed thatnarrow-body jetliner sales will continue to be hardest hit.Boeing recently announced it would slash production atRenton, Wash., of its popular line of 737s to 14 a month from21, and the company has attributed some of the thousands ofjobs cuts planned for this year to slowdowns in commercialjet orders. Many of McDonnell Douglas's recent layoffs at itsLong Beach, Calif., jetliner operations have reflected itsown slowdown at the MD-80 narrow-body line.   &quot;We do not think that Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglascan sustain their previous levels of announced productionrates,&quot; said Steven Udvar-Hazy, president of InternationalLease, based in Beverly Hills, in an address this week at theannual Speednews aerospace-industry supplier conference.   Mr. Hazy, allowing that a sharp economic upturn couldchange his prediction, said the reason he believes moreproduction cuts are on the way is that &quot;so far only some ofthe very large airlines have announced major deferments andcutbacks&quot; in their fleet-growth plans. Others, he said, aresure to adopt the cost-cutting kicked off in recent months byleaders AMR Corp. and UAL Corp., parents of American Airlinesand United Airlines.   Kenneth Holden, the chief strategist for GPA, saiddeliveries of jumbo jets will be stable, but deliveries ofnarrow-bodies will decline by 42% to 370 in 1995, from the633 delivered by all makers in 1991. That fact, he added,&quot;isn't yet recognized in the announced plans of the majorairframe manufacturers.&quot;   Mr. Holden said it is possible the manufacturers areholding back on disclosing planned cutbacks because &quot;it's asensitive matter&quot; with workers, suppliers and airlinecustomers. He declined to address GPA's financial prospectsdirectly, noting that the leasing company is constrainedbecause it plans a public stock offering of as much as $1billion in June.   The jetliner manufacturers, for their part, generally makea secret of their production plans. David Sepanen, directorof marketing projects at Boeing, said that Boeing and othermanufacturers appear simply to disagree with the leasingcompanies over the strength of future demand.   An Airbus spokeswoman declined comment on the leasingcompany estimates. Airbus said it is producing just under 14jets monthly, and hasn't scaled back production.   A McDonnell Douglas spokesman said production of MD-11widebody jets has been steady, and will remain at 40 aircraftannually. Production of narrow-body MD80s has fallen to 90from 140 last year year as a result of a slackening ofdemand. He said that generally, 5,000 of 15,000 job cuts inLong Beach in recent years can be attributed to the weakeneddemand.   The leasing firms generally predict that deliveries of newplanes will firm after 1995 as air-travel improves. Airlinescan use &quot;hush-kits,&quot; at a cost of $3 million to $5 millionper plane, to modify engines and meet new noise restrictions,thus postponing the retirement of several hundred jets foryears. But the inefficient jets still would have to bereplaced eventually, International Lease's Mr. Hazy said.Another 1,500 old jetliners are likely to be retired in thenext three years, shoring up demand for new planes.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
