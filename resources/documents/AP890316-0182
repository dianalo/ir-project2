Eugenio Vides Casanova said in a television interview.   There was virtually no traffic on the streets as the guerrillatransport ban took effect at midnight Wednesday. Officialsdiscovered tiny, sharp three-pronged devices scattered on citystreets early Thursday.   The army said it was providing protection for travelers on 80percent of the country's highways but acknowledged late Thursdaythat the traffic ban was 90 percent effective.   ``It is not support for the ban, but fear that kept the buses offthe highways,'' said an army spokesman on usual condition ofanonymity.   There were no additional reports of armed rebel activity late inthe day. Most businesses in the capital were open, but customerswere few.   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the umbrellacoalition of five groups fighting the U.S.-backed government,decreed the ban after the failure of negotiations over its offer toparticipate in the election.   ``The FMLN has no right to prevent the people from voting,''declared Fidel Chavez Mena, candidate of the incumbent ChristianDemocratic Party.   Guillermo Ungo, candidate of the leftist Democratic Convergence,condemned the rebels for engaging in violence after having offeredto join the political process.   ``They want to jump in bed but still remain a virgin,'' saidUngo, whose alliance maintained close links with the FMLN and givesvoters the opportunity to vote for a leftist presidential candidatefor the first time since 1979.   The other top candidate is Alfredo Cristiani of the conservativeRepublican National Alliance, or Arena. Polls show Cristianigathering the largest share of Sunday's vote, but there is a highpossibility for error due to the reluctance of many people to givetheir views.   In a statement released in Mexico City, the guerrillas said theelection was an attempt to legitimize the war and to ``justifycontinued U.S. arms shipments and aid.''   The statement said the election would be a fraud in which themilitary would control ``the votes and the results.'' However, therebel statement also said working for Ungo was a ``valid option.''   Francisco Merino, Arena's vice presidential candidate, said therebel ban and the wave of violence ``are an illogical mistake of theFMLN.''   ``They had been given an opportunity to show their sincerity inthe proposal for peace. Their leadership is showing that they haveno intention of paying attention to this call we and the people andthe international community have made on them,'' Merino said.   Nearly 1.8 million voters are registered to vote for presidentand vice president. In addition to the top three, there are fourminor party candidates. If no candidate receives more than 50percent on Sunday, the top two vote-getters will face each other ina runoff.   The winner will take over the presidency from Jose NapoleonDuarte, the incumbent Christian Democrat, on June 1.   The FMLN on Thursday urged all government election officials toquit their jobs, and their guerrillas attacked a coffee storagefacility and sabotaged electrical power lines. One soldier waskilled and four others wounded during a rebel attack, the armedforces press office said.   Appealing for calm, Vides Casanova said, ``We are going to hearsome bombs, and we are going to see sabotage and they will make us abit nervous.''   Vides Casanova acknowledged the rebels were capable of causingdisruptions and referred to guerrilla sabotage during elections in1982 and 1985.   ``It is easy to disrupt electricity or to throw a bomb. They havedone that in the past,'' he said. The rebels boycotted previouselections this decade, saying the voting was little more than partof a U.S.-designed counterinsurgency strategy. Still, as many as 75percent of eligible voters went to the polls in 1985.   The guerrillas offered to take part in elections if they werepostponed and other guarantees were put in place, but negotiationswith the political parties and the government stalled.   The army provided trucks under military escort to transportcapital residents, while a few private pickup trucks volunteeredtheir services.   Eight armored vehicles escorted a four-truck convoy carryingpassengers along a highway from San Salvador to towns to the east.   ``The armed forces are here to protect you from the terrorists ofthe FMLN,'' a loudspeaker blared as the convoy departed a busterminal.   Previous bans have been effective because the guerrillas sabotageor burn vehicles that violate it. Reports from the countrysideindicated the ban had virtually paralyzed traffic outside thecapital.</TEXT></DOC>
