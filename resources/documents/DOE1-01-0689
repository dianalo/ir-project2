<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-01-0689 </DOCNO><TEXT>Ferritic stainless steel, hereafter called HT-9, is a prospective candidatematerial for the first wall of a fusion power reactor because of itshigh resistance to irradiation swelling due to 14 MeV neutrons. The largeincrease of the transition temperature has been proven to be in a rangeof 50/sup 0/C even for a neutron fluence of more than 50 dpa. However,since it is magnetized in a magnetic field, it experiences magnetic stressdue to magnetization when it is used in the field. The magnetomechanicalbehaviour is not simple because its relative permeability is very high({approx_equal}1000) and the B-H curve is nonlinear and followed by saturationof the magnetization. Beam-plates of HT-9 and mild steel were providedto carry out tests on the magnetomechanical behavior and compare it tothe theoretical prediction. The theoretical prediction of the mechanicalbehavior was made for the configuration of the beam-plate based on non-linearnumerical analysis of magnetization. The field distribution of the finitespecimen is very different from that of an infinite specimen. It is alsofound that the deformation is proportional to the squared field for avery small applied field and increases monotonously to a peak. For aspecimen with small inclination to the incident field, the deformationdecreases very rapidly after the peak.</TEXT></DOC>
