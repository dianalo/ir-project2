The 1986 law, while lowering rates and raising exemptions, bars achild from taking any exemption if he or she can be claimed as adependent by a parent or someone else. In many cases it reduces thestandard deduction for dependents. And it requires any dependentwith interest, dividends or other unearned income totaling as littleas $501 to file a return.   Each personal exemption means a $1,950 reduction in 1988 incomesubject to taxation. For most taxpayers, that is a saving of $292.50in taxes; for those in the 28 percent tax bracket, it is a saving ofup to $546.   Five tests must be met for you to claim a person as yourdependent:   _ The dependent must be a resident or citizen of the UnitedStates or a resident of Canada or Mexico.   _ He or she must not have filed a joint return with a spouse.   _ The dependent must be your child, grandchild, parent,grandparent, brother, sister, nephew, niece, uncle, aunt, son- ordaughter-in-law, parent-in-law, brother- or sister-in-law, or anyperson who is a member of your household and lived with youthroughout the year.   _ The dependent's gross income for 1988 must have been less than$1,950. This does not apply to your dependent child who either wasunder 19 at the end of the year or was a full-time student.   _ You must have furnished more than half the dependent's supportduring the year. (There are exceptions if you are divorced.) Supportincludes foot, lodging, clothing, education, medical care,transportation, toys, pocket money, etc.   If all those conditions are met, you may take an exemption for adependent. But that dependent cannot take an exemption on his or herpersonal tax return _ even if you don't actually claim it.   So, how are your family's taxes affected if your 17-year-olddaughter had a part-time job and a small savings account last year?She earned $2,500 in the job and $200 interest.   You, the parent, are allowed to claim her as a dependent. Forthat reason, and because her gross income exceeds $500, she mustfile a return as well. Her standard deduction is her total earnedincome or $3,000 (the usual standard deduction for a single person),whichever is smaller. Since her earned income _ wages, tips, feesand the like _ was $2,500, that also is her standard deduction.   She should file the simplest form, 1040EZ. Only $200 of herincome would be taxable and her tax liability (from the tax table onpage 37 in the instructions) would be $32.   In the unlikely event that your daughter had itemized deductionsexceeding $2,500, it would be to her advantage to itemize ratherthan take the standard deduction. She then would have to file Form1040 and Schedule A, rather than 1040EZ.   If she had no unearned income _ such as interest and dividends _she would not have to file a return unless her earned incomeexceeded $3,000. But she should file to get a refund of any incometax that was withheld from her earnings.   In any case, the standard deduction for a person who can beclaimed as a dependent of another may not exceed $500 of thedependent's earned income _ whichever is greater.   The real complications occur when your child is under 14 and hasunearned income of more than $1,000. In that case, some of thechild's income will be taxed at your, presumably higher, maximum taxrate. You should read the instructions for Form 8615, which may haveto be attached to your child's return.   This new provision is aimed at deterring the avoidance of tax bya parent's shifting of income-producing property to a child.   Remember that you must list on your tax return the SocialSecurity number of any child age 5 or older whom you claim as adependent.</TEXT></DOC>
