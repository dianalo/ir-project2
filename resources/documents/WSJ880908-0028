Traders generally expect weakness today not only in junk bond prices, but also in stocks subject to takeover bids that need junk bond financing. They speculate that some pending junk bond issues might have to be postponed to let the market settle down.    &quot;I wouldn't be surprised if the market was made a little more tentative,&quot; said Raymond Minella, managing director in charge of high-yield finance at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;But I wouldn't expect any major movement one way or another.&quot;    Yesterday's announcement of the charges crossed newswires after 4:30 p.m. EDT, too late to affect bond prices much. Some traders said bids dried up after news. But others said there wasn't time to get a meaningful reading.    The question is of more than academic interest to investors in mutual funds and other money managers, which Drexel estimates hold 30% of the high-yield bonds outstanding. Drexel says insurance companies own 30%, pension funds 15%, and savings and loans hold 8%.    Other brokerage houses have moved in to compete with Drexel in the junk bond market in recent years. Many junk dealers and investors argue the greater diversity will protect them if the charges lead to Drexel's being barred from the business or if Drexel faces some financial penalty that would hurt its ability to buy and sell bonds.    At First Boston Inc., which ranks second to Drexel this year in public junk bond underwritings, high-yield research director Robert Long said, &quot;The market has anticipated this because of all the publicity.&quot; He predicted the reaction would be milder than that following the first disclosure that Drexel was under investigation.    Institutional investors and rival securities dealers weren't predicting a calamity yesterday; their livelihoods depend on the market's health. But they did acknowledge the threat of disruption posed by the charges against Drexel and its junk bond chief, Michael Milken, who pioneered the use of the bonds for takeovers and for more routine financing by companies with speculative-grade debt securities.    The junk market has already weathered three crises in the past two years, gradually rebounding each time over a period of weeks or months. The first case was the bankruptcy-law filing of LTV Corp. in mid-1986. The second was the November 1986 disclosure of the federal probe of Drexel following arbitrager Ivan Boesky's insider-trading guilty plea. The third was last October's stock market crash.    As it became clear that the crash wouldn't trigger an immediate recession, a rebound in junk bond prices this year made them the best performing class of bonds through the first half of 1988. They have also outpaced corporate bond returns since 1981, according to First Boston.    After each of the earlier crises, dealers and investors were reassured by the absence of a general rush for the exits, particularly among individual investors in mutual funds, who some had feared might dump their holdings.    Mutual fund expert Michael Lipper of Lipper Analytical Services Inc. said yesterday, &quot;Unless (Drexel is) suspended from making markets, there shouldn't be a pricing issue.&quot;    But the junk bond arena, like all markets, depends on confidence. In this case it isn't a question of whether the issuers can keep making their interest payments and avoid the rash of defaults widely predicted to occur in the next recession.    Instead, the Drexel case raises the question of liquidity -- whether investors can easily sell bonds when they want to without being forced to accept a steep discount. The possible absence of Drexel as a bidder has raised fears that such discounts would rise.    &quot;I worry about liquidity long term,&quot; Mariel Clemenson, head of high-yield research at Donaldson, Lufkin, andamp; Jenrette Securities Inc., said yesterday after the charges were announced.    Many investors have taken comfort in the stepped-up activities in the high-yield market of other rival dealers including Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., Salomon Brothers Inc. and Donaldson Lufkin.    They reason that even though Drexel pioneered the market and retains the most extensive network of buyers, these newer entrants would step in and make more bids on the larger, more widely held issues.    &quot;If there are bonds that are affected, it will be the smaller issues where Drexel is the principal trader,&quot; said one corporate bond analyst at a major dealer.    In a typical comment yesterday, Howard Marks, who manages $900 million of high-yield bonds for Trust Co. of the West in Los Angeles, said, &quot;The market has had a year and three quarters to prepare for this news. I don't want to prejudge the situation, but I think the days are long gone since a problem for Drexel would have been a big problem for this market.&quot;    However, the rival brokerages have lost some ground this year after making steady inroads since Drexel's Mr. Milken virtually invented the market in the early 1980s. In 1984, Drexel held a commanding 68% of the market for new public junk bond issues, according to IDD Information Services Inc. By 1987 that share had slipped to 40%. But this year Drexel has rebounded to 50% through Tuesday, according to IDD.    Out of $16.97 billion in junk bonds sold publicly this year, IDD says First Boston has been the lead underwriter for 14%, Morgan Stanley 8.2%, Salomon Brothers 7.2%, Donaldson Lufkin 4.6%, and Merrill Lynch 4%.    Most brokerage firms wouldn't say what contingency plans they have in this situation, apparently to avoid seeming too eager to profit from another firm's problems.    &quot;We have been devoting a lot of resources to the high-yield market for three or four years,&quot; said Merrill's Mr. Minella. &quot;This doesn't cause us to change anything.&quot;    He said Merrill's market share has fallen this year because leveraged buy-outs trailed off in the first few months of 1988 as corporate managements paused to assess the economy's strength. &quot;We have a huge backlog (of planned junk bond offerings) now, in excess of $2 billion.&quot;    ---               The House That Junk Bonds Built   1935 -- Burnham andamp; Co. is founded in New York by I.W.
