This reduction was made possible inpart by anticipated savings from further cuts in the accessfees charged by local telephone companies. Another factor isa change ATandamp;T is making in directory assistance: ATandamp;T said itwill eliminate the free call to interstate directoryassistance now offered each month, saying only one in fourresidential customers use directory assistance during athree-month period. The price of a directory assistance callis 60 cents.   When the July 1 decrease takes effect, a 10-minutedirect-dialed call anywhere in the continental U.S. will cost$1.53 or less, compared with the current $1.58 or less.
