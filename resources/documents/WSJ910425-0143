Everyone, that is, except a succession of TreasurySecretaries and a gaggle of prominent economists.Periodically over the past 15 years or so, such experts havedeparted from the common understandings of common men todeclare that what this nation needs is an unsound currency.They have urged a cheap dollar in order to make imports moreexpensive and exports cheaper, exorcising the demon tradedeficit.</LP><TEXT>   Such voices have been happily if uncharacteristicallymuted in 1991, even though the dollar gained more than 19%against the German mark in only two months. Yes, TreasuryUndersecretary David Mulford voiced some concern about the&quot;rapidity&quot; of the surge, and the world's central banks haveoccasionally and ineffectually intervened against thegreenback. But these challenges have been to the speed of themovement, not its direction.   And yes, Treasury Secretary Brady has again called on theFederal Reserve to lower interest rates. But his position hasconsiderably more credibility with a rising dollar than itdid with a falling one. With the dollar strong in theforeign-exchange markets, with this strength confirmed by agold price sinking toward $350, and with a recession underway, we ourselves can see a case for the Federal Reserve tocreate dollars somewhat more rapidly.   Yet the dollar will not be in equilibrium until it reachespurchasing power parity -- the exchange rate at whichequivalent quantities of two currencies can purchase the samebasket of goods. By any reasonable estimate of PPP, thedollar remains undervalued even at its new levels. A newestimate by the Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. economics department, forexample, sets PPP at 150 yen and 1.90 marks, againstyesterday's rates of 137.90 yen and 1.67 marks.   The theoretical significance is that a PPP exchange rateis transparent in cross-border economic decisions. Purchasesand investments will reflect real economic values, just asthey do within one nation with one currency. This lets theprice mechanism work in allocating resources to best uses,maximizing efficiency and production across borders.   Then too, the PPP equilibrium has an inherent pull of itsown. Currencies can deviate from PPP for extended periods, asthe dollar has since January 1986. But a misaligned ratecreates opportunities for arbitrage in traded goods, and theflow of goods creates financial pressures back toward the PPPrate. This pressure can produce a surge when somethinghappens to change expectations, as happened with the dollarthis year.   The dollar surged with a change in political prospects.President Bush's victory in the Gulf War became increasinglyobvious, and at least some measure of economic bounce nowseems likely. Meanwhile Europe and Japan are finding thatthey are not entirely immune to the U.S. recession. The markin particular has developed a queasiness of its own.   The Bundesbank, indeed, has to be listed among thecasualties of German reunification. It turned out to be notsuch an independent central bank after all, as politicalarguments overrode financial ones in setting a one-to-oneexchange rate with the old East German currency. As the bankno doubt understood, this set East German wages at levelsthat can't be sustained by East German output, withunemployment the natural result. The slack in the Germaneconomy put the mark under pressure.   In early February, the Bundesbank tried to offset thispressure by raising interest rates, just as the Fed wascutting its discount rate, and to the great displeasure ofGermany's European partners already feeling recessionaryimpulses. Aside from failing to protect the mark, thissignaled that Bundesbank policy would hew to narrow domesticGerman concerns, with no thought of the wider EuropeanCommunity.   The dollar's new surge has demonstrated that it has nosubstitute as the world currency. This should be food forthought for American policy makers. As possession of theworld's dominant military force gave the U.S. specialresponsibilities in policing the Persian Gulf, so managementof the world's dominant currency gives the U.S. specialresponsibilities for the stability of the world financialsystem. Like the Bundesbank and the German government, theFed and the U.S. government have tended too much to purelydomestic concerns -- in seeking to depreciate the dollar forexport advantage, and before that in breaking up the BrettonWoods monetary system that produced unprecedented worldprosperity from 1945 to 1973.   Here too the dollar's current surge is portentous. Yes,the fundamentals of the U.S. and German economies havechanged. But have they changed by 19% over two months? Dothey change by 2.3% in one day, as the exchange rate did onsome days? These swings wipe out or reverse the margins onwhich economic decisions must be made, and American policymakers ought to be thinking whether an increasinglyintegrated world economy can ever return to the pre-1973growth rates under a system that allows and even encouragesthem.</TEXT></DOC>
