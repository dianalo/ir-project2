In the early years, the desperately poor Asian nation was recovering from a ruinous war, but today its economy is booming and the American defenders are a resented reminder of past dependency.    As many U.S. and Korean officials see it, the issue isn't the American military presence so much as it is a command structure, dating from the war, that gives a U.S. Army general operational control over the bulk of South Korea's ground forces. As a result, Seoul's military leaders must seek permission from the American brass when they want to call those forces into action.    &quot;For national pride, it isn't good for a foreign general to be in charge,&quot; says Lee Shin Bom, an opposition leader exiled by the government of President Chun Doo Hwan in 1983.    Revision of the command structure is &quot;inevitable,&quot; predicts Gen. Edward Meyer, a retired U.S. Army chief of staff. He says the most logical change would place all ground forces in South Korea under the control of a Korean general. But he doesn't expect any change until after the national elections and Summer Olympics next year. Neither country wants a nasty squabble over the military pecking order to spoil the games. More important, some U.S. and Korean officials worry that a more independent military might be used to enforce acts of political repression by Seoul's current government.    Yet, as South Korean opposition leaders struggle to free the country from dictatorship and move toward democracy, the U.S. role as commander and supporter of Korea's armed forces may become a growing source of tension between Washington and Seoul. &quot;Korea has put up with a very difficult situation, having their forces under the operational control of a foreigner,&quot; says William H. Gleysteen, the U.S. ambassador to South Korea from 1978 to 1981. &quot;In the Korean psyche, this is an element of their dependency and their resentment.&quot;    Technically, all U.S. and the bulk of South Korean troops are under the control of the United Nations Command that led the 1950-53 war against communist North Korea and its ally, China. But the head of the U.N. forces is always the commanding general of the 40,000 U.S. troops stationed in Korea. In 1978, the Korean government gained a more prominent role in defense planning with the formation of a Combined Forces Command, which brought together U.S. and South Korean military officers in a single structure. Although military tactics are jointly organized and planned, the Korean military still remains subordinate to the U.S. commander.    The U.S. military is viewed as a constraining influence in a country given to armed repression, but it hasn't always been able to keep Korean troops out of politics. In 1979, Chun Doo Hwan, then a general, siezed power in a military coup. In 1980, Korean troops called in by President Chun put down a student uprising in Kwangju, killing about 200 people. The U.S. claimed its control didn't cover the use of the particular South Korean troops used to quell unrest at Kwangju.    The Korean government has direct control over the feared &quot;black beret&quot; special warfare troops and several paramilitary groups used to quash internal unrest.    The role of the U.S. military poses a paradox for the Korean opposition. Reformers see a fully independent military as the hallmark of South Korea's new self-sufficiency. But so long as the Chun government -- or any other repressive regime -- holds power, they are willing to put up with American paternalism as a check against politically directed excesses.    &quot;In principle, they feel that some day the command structure should be transferred to a Korean general,&quot; says Mr. Lee. The problem, he says, is that the opposition feels that the time isn't ripe for such a change, &quot;because under this kind of military dictatorship, that would be very dangerous.&quot;    But Gen. Meyer believes that if the South Korean army has greater responsibility for countering the threat from the North, it &quot;will be less inclined to want to get involved in politics.&quot; Still, a military restructuring designed to appease South Korean nationalists might be perceived in North Korea as a weakening of the U.S. commitment. The harshest critics of the Chun regime are genuinely worried about fostering such a perception. An aide to Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) says: &quot;They're very practical people. They know that without our help, North Korea would invade and they couldn't stop them.&quot;    But Korea's military is tending to assert its independence. For example, Korea plans to buy a new fleet of anti-submarine helicopters, but has made it clear that it may shun the U.S. model -- and thwart the advice of the U.S. Navy -- by giving the order to British or French suppliers, both of which have made cheaper proposals.    In the end, tensions over the military command structure would lessen under a freely elected, civilian government. That would help free the Korean military from unsavory political associations, and ease the guilt-by-association resentment directed at the U.S. military. Inevitably, greater command authority would flow to the Korean military leadership, and the U.S. could progress from being a supreme protector to something more akin to an ally. </TEXT></DOC>
