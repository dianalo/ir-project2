Activity remained subdued, however, with many participants reluctant to trade on a day departing Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan, his nominated successor, testified before the U.S. Congress.    Although none of the comments made by Messrs. Volcker or Greenspan had much effect on the market, the testimony seemed to confirm a continued cautious Fed approach with restraint on monetary policy, one economist with a U.K. bank said.    Meanwhile, secondary Euroyen issues recovered a bit of the ground lost in previous sessions after the Japanese government market closed little changed. Longer-dated issues were said to have gained about 3/8 point.    Elsewhere, General Motors Acceptance Corp.'s $250 million offering of 8%, two-year Eurobonds, launched Monday, was said to have eased after encountering muted demand in Tokyo overnight.    Earlier Tuesday, GMAC (Australia) Finance Ltd. issued 40 million Australian dollars ($28 million) of 13 3/4%, two-year Eurobonds at 101 3/8 to yield 12.93%.    The lead manager, County Natwest Ltd., said that there was some strong initial retail demand but that it expects the issue will take a few weeks to place because of the oversupply of Australian dollar bond paper in the market.    However, the issue is priced attractively, and the GMAC name is highly recognizable to retail investors who buy Australian dollar bonds, dealers said. </TEXT></DOC>
