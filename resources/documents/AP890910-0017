But six months after it was formed,the rebel Cabinet is feuding openly and has yet to move onto Afghansoil.   The guerrillas, many headquartered in the Pakistani frontier cityof Peshawar, predicted the Marxists wouldn't last more than a fewweeks after Soviet combat forces withdrew from Afghanistan inFebruary.   But the ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, whichcontinues to recieve massive Soviet aid, has held its ground.   The Communists are defending Kabul, the capital, and other keyAfghan cities. The insurgents, called mujahedeen or Islamic ``holywarriors,'' still control much of the countryside.   But to the dismay of their sponsors, some rebel groups haveengaged in bitter internal disputes.   The Afghan Interim Government was formed Feb. 24 in Islamabad byan alliance of seven mujahedeen groups based in Pakistan, thetemporary home of some 3 million Afghan refugees.   Assuming the Communists' imminent defeat, the interim governmentwas meant as a transitional administration to oversee theestablishment of an Islamic republic of Afghanistan.   The interim government pledged to move inside Afghanistan andhold elections for a parliament within 6 months in ``liberatedareas'' and in refugee camps in Pakistan. The parliament was todraft an Islamic constitution and vote on whether to replace theinterim government.   None of that has happened.   The rebels fought in March to the suburbs of Jalalabad,Afghanistan's third-largest city just 40 miles from the Pakistanborder. But they stalled under withering artillery fire and aerialbombardment.   Then in July, the traditional enmity between two of the mostpowerful rebel groups led to a massacre in northern Afghanistan.   Guerrillas of the fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islami group allegedlyambushed and murdered 32 commanders of the more liberalJamiat-i-Islami party. There are unconfirmed reports of hundredsmore dead in subsequent clashes between the two groups.   The United States expressed its disappointment. ``The recentlyreported internecine fighting is discouraging, since resistanceunity and cooperation is of paramount importance,'' said PeterThomsen, the U.S. special envoy to the rebel government.   Naim Majrooh, an Afghan intellectual living in Peshawar, said thetension isn't based on ideology.   ``It's a moral struggle among the ranks, a physical struggleamong the parties and an ego struggle among the (mujahedeen)leaders,'' Majrooh said.   Most observers believe the parties of the rebel government areunited only in their hatred of the Kabul government of PresidentNajib.   Fundamentalist parties want to replace the Communists with astrict Islamic order while others favor a more liberal regime. Somewant to fight for a total military victory, while others areprepared to talk peace. Several parties are based primarily onpersonal loyalties.   The rebel government does not include the Iran-based alliance ofeight mujahedeen groups, called The Council of Islamic Coalition ofAfghanistan. The coalition is predominantly Shiite Moslem, while thePakistan-based rebels are mainly Sunnis.   Shiites were estimated to make up about 17 percent ofAfghanistan's pre-war population of 15 million. The Pakistan-basedrebels claim the Shiites have demanded a disproportionately largerepresentation in the government.   Thomsen said on a recent visit to Pakistan that the Iran-basedguerrillas remain ``essential'' if the rebel government is torepresent a broad sampling of Afghans.   The fighting between the Hezb-i-Islami and Jamiat-i-Islamiparties has widened the rifts within the guerrilla government itself.   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, the moderate president, has publiclycalled the leader of the Hezb-i-Islami, Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, a``killer'' who is ``destroying Afghanistan.''   Hekmatyar, who serves as foreign minister, has suspended his rolein the government for its failure to hold elections.   Pakistan is anxious to see an end to the war, which broke outafter the Communists seized power in Kabul in a 1978 military coup.Soviet forces intervened in December 1979 to replace one Communistgovernment with another, then sent in more than 100,000 Red Armysoldiers to help fight the insurgents.   Moscow finally withdrew its troops between May 15, 1988, and Feb.15, 1989, after managing only to fight the mujahedeen to a stalemate.   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, in a recent interviewwith The Associated Press, indicated she shares the U.S. view thatthe rebel government, with all its problems, is still the onlyalternative to what both countries view as an illegitimategovernment in Kabul.   ``It would make us much happier if accusations andcounter-accusations did not take place. But we feel that in thegiven context, the Afghan Interim Government is the best frameworkthere is for a political settlement in the country,'' Ms. Bhuttosaid.   Mujahedeen leaders have attributed their recent military problemsto a lack of U.S.-supplied weapons and a change from guerrillatactics to conventional warfare.   ``We haven't received any new weapons for eight months,'' saidMasoud Khalili, a spokesman of the Jamiat-i-Islami group.   Thomsen insists Washington still stands firmly behind themujahedeen despite the anti-American sentiments of some of thefundamentalist Moslem rebel leaders, notably Hekmatyar.</TEXT></DOC>
