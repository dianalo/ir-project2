Naomi Knickerbocker, 19, is the only child of reporter JaneDornacker, 39, who was killed in 1986.   Miss Knickerbocker's attorney, James Molesky of Oakland, Calif.,said a court fight might have gained his client more money, but saidshe wanted to dispose of the matter because, she said, her mother's``tragic death has been most difficult and painful'' for her.   The settlement was approved Dec. 14 by Manhattan Surrogate CourtJudge Marie M. Lambert. It was disclosed on Friday.   Ms. Dornacker, who came to New York from San Francisco, wasbroadcasting a traffic report for WNBC radio when the helicopter inwhich she was riding crashed into the Hudson River.   As the chopper plunged toward a pier, listeners heard Ms.Dornacker scream at the pilot, ``Hit the water! Hit the water!''   Ms. Dornacker's body was pulled from the submerged helicopterabout 10 minutes later.   Spectrum Helicopters of Ridgefield Park, N.J., owners andoperators of the crashed aircraft, will pay $250,000 of thesettlement. The remaining $75,000 will be paid by Enstrom HelicopterCorp. of Menominee, Mich., manufacturers of the chopper, and theFormsprag Industrial Power Transmission division of Dana Corp.,makers of the helicopter's failed transmission.</TEXT></DOC>
