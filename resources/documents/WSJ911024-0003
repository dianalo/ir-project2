The agency made the decision in spite of new estimatesshowing the bank deposit insurance fund is running out ofmoney faster than expected. The FDIC's new figures, whichreflect the limp economic recovery, continuing problems withreal estate, and rising bank failures, forecast that the fundwill have a $2.6 billion balance at year end and fall into adeficit of $9.6 billion next year. In June, the agencyprojected a $3.2 billion balance at year end and a $3 billiondeficit at the end of 1992.</LP><TEXT>   Congress is currently preparing to vote on a banking billthat would boost the FDIC's borrowing capacity by $70billion, to ensure that the agency can continue to protectdeposits in failing banks. The loans would be paid backgradually by the banking industry, which currently supportsdeposit insurance with a premium of 23 cents for each $100 ofdomestic deposits.   The FDIC considered a premium increase at the request ofSen. Donald Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.Last week, in response to an FDIC admission that economicconditions were draining the insurance fund faster thanexpected, Mr. Riegle (D., Mich.) suggested that the banksshould pay higher premiums to head off the need for apossible taxpayer bailout of the fund.   But the American Bankers Association said a premiumincrease on Jan. 1, the next legal opportunity to boost thefee, would hurt banks and the economy. &quot;Raising premiums willreduce credit availability and slow the economic recovery,&quot;the ABA argued in a lengthy analysis it sent to the FDICboard, as well as to Congress and the White House. &quot;In turn,the slower recovery will result in additional bank failuresand an even greater burden on the Bank Insurance Fund.&quot;   On Tuesday, the four members of the FDIC board ofdirectors agreed unanimously that now isn't the right time toboost the premium. Every one-cent increase in the premiumwould cost banks about $250 million annually. &quot;While it'sapparent that a premium increase may be necessary, the staffwork isn't complete&quot; to give a clear picture of what impactan increase would have on the health of the banking industryand the insurance fund, asserted Alan Whitney, FDIC Directorof Corporate Communications.   William Taylor, a Federal Reserve Board official who isabout to become chairman of the FDIC, agreed with thedecision. Under the law, the FDIC must announce a premiumincrease by Nov. 1 if it is to take effect on Jan. 1.   The Board's decision means Mr. Taylor won't have to facethe difficult challenge of balancing congressional pressurefor a higher premium with economic arguments against hittingbanks with an additional cost now. Bush administrationofficials expressed concern that a premium increase wouldaggravate a credit crunch they believe is choking therecovery.   But the new Bank Insurance Fund estimates that the FDICsent to Congress yesterday make it clear that Mr. Taylor isinheriting severe problems from his predecessor, L. WilliamSeidman. The agency expects that bank failures willaccelerate to 200 next year from 137 this year -- 103 havefailed so far in 1991.   That projection is based on an assumption that &quot;economicconditions affecting the value of bank assets (particularlyrealestate markets) neither deteriorate further nordramatically improve,&quot; and it shows the fund falling to adeficit of $18.3 billion by the end of 1993, according to aletter FDIC Vice Chairman Andrew C. Hove wrote to Sen.Riegle.   A more pessimistic projection shows 239 bank failures nextyear, driving the fund $14.1 billion into the red in 1992 andto a deficit of $28.9 billion in 1993. The agency didn'trelease the number of banks it expects to fail in 1993.   Mr. Hove told Mr. Riegle that the new borrowing authorityshould be enough to enable the FDIC to meet its needs, but hewarned that if economic conditions worsen and more banksfail, the new authority &quot;could ultimately proveinsufficient.&quot;   Sen. Riegle said, &quot;The administration must take a veryclose look at the FDIC's new projections and decide whether agreater margin of safety should be provided&quot; by seekinghigher borrowing authority for the FDIC. In the meantime, hesaid, &quot;The FDIC can increase the margin of safety -- andreduce the risk of a direct taxpayer bailout -- by raisingbank insurance premiums now.&quot;   The proposal to boost FDIC borrowing authority by $70billion is part of a sweeping banking bill that is currentlythe object of intense negotiations in Congress. Lawmakersmust approve the borrowing authority in order to protectdeposits. At the same time, Congress is likely to tightenbank regulation and reduce the scope of federal depositinsurance. Lawmakers are also likely to allow banks to branchnationwide, but it's unclear whether Congress will adopt aproposal that will also allow banks to enter the securitiesbusiness.   Last night, some members of Congress who have supportedbroad reform were threatening to change their position inopposition to a compromise between the chairmen of the HouseBanking Committee and the Committee on Energy and Commercethat they said didn't go far enough.   Today, House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) will meetwith a group of bankers and bank lobbyists who worry that thebanking bill the House is likely to take up next week doesn'tdo enough to allow banks to compete with securities andinsurance firms.</TEXT></DOC>
