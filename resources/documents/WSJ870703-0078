JamesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The passage of the nation's toughest and most comprehensive AIDS legislation by Illinois lawmakers reflects a political backlash against the more moderate policies urged by public-health officials.    The package of Illinois legislation, which awaits Gov. James Thompson's signature, is already stirring controversy. One bill, which Gov. Thompson supports, requires mandatory testing of all marriage-license applicants. Illinois would be the first state to require such tests.    The measures also would require testing of hospital patients between the ages of 13 and 55, and that health workers notify school officials about children diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Sexual partners of those carrying the virus would be traced and notified, and infected people viewed as threats to public health would be quarantined by court order.    The radical measures swept through the Illinois legislature by a wide margin late last week and early this week, despite protests by the state's own public-health officials and intense budget pressures. The bills reflect politicians' concern about the rapidity of the spread of AIDS, particularly in cities like Chicago.    &quot;Apparently, political expediency has prevailed over common sense and the advice of the public-health establishment in the U.S.,&quot; says Thomas B. Stoddard, executive director of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York, an organization concerned with AIDS and gay rights.    &quot;In Illinois, we've declared that the legislature is tired of waiting for the public-health authorities to respond to something they should have responded to all along,&quot; said Penny Pullen, an Illinois senator and one of the sponsors of the legislation.    Lawmakers and public-health officials nationwide are taking a close look at the legislation, which lands square in the middle of the national debate over AIDS testing and control policy. Currently, mandatory testing applies only to military recruits and many foreign-service officers.    Thirty-five states have considered pre-marital AIDS testing. Texas recently passed a law that would require pre-marital testing if the AIDS virus reaches a specified level in the state's population, and South Carolina is considering a pre-marital-testing bill.    Last year, California rejected mandatory pre-marital testing in favor of giving educational information to anyone applying for a marriage license; Virginia took similar steps this year. Utah recently passed a law banning common-law marriages if a partner tests positive. Other states, including Michigan, are mulling contact-tracing laws.    Critics of the Illinois bills, including public-health officials, civil libertarians, Chicago Mayor Harold Washington and gay-rights leaders, fear the move could signal the start of a larger political backlash against the moderate policies recommended so far by medical groups. Illinois legislators have &quot;set a very dangerous and sorry example for the other states,&quot; says Mr. Stoddard of the gay-rights group.    The critics note that the Illinois legislation contradicts guidance from the Centers for Disease Control, the surgeon general and, to some extent, the American Medical Association. Public-health specialists generally oppose mandatory testing and keeping lists of names of those testing positive in favor of voluntary, anonymous testing and education. They view the testing of certain low-risk groups, such as marriage-license applicants, as a waste of resources.    The measures also are opposed as discriminatory, counterproductive and costly. The legislation would violate privacy rights, foster discrimination against homosexuals and frighten away from testing members of high-risk groups, critics maintain. Furthermore, testing and contact-tracing could put heavy pressure on state budgets. It costs $80 to $100 for each sexual contact traced in Illinois, says Harvey Grossman of the American Civil Liberties Union. And the basic AIDS antibody test, the Elisa, costs as much as $30 each; an entire screening, including confirmatory testing, costs about $140.    &quot;People who are talking about costs just don't understand what's coming down,&quot; says Ms. Pullen, the state senator. She argues that there already have been substantial costs, and that &quot;prudent protection measures need to be taken now in order to prevent us from having to suffer&quot; more in the future.    The Illinois AIDS bills do have some positive aspects, the critics concede. In particular, the measures would create stricter standards of confidentiality to protect AIDS sufferers. Anyone breaching confidentiality would be subject to criminal rather than the current civil penalties.    In general, legislators are &quot;expressing frustration that this disease won't lend itself to a quick fix in any form,&quot; says Renslow Sherer, chairman of the Illinos AIDS Council and head of AIDS services at Chicago's Cook County Hospital. &quot;It's a fearful problem and legislators are responding the only way they know how -- by passing laws.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
