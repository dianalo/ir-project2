That's the magic of the &quot;debt payment story,&quot; which hasseized hold of investors' imagination this year. They knowthat some buy-out companies going public could show profitgains even in a slow economy, just by using money from astock sale to pay debt and cut their interest bills. And inusing the debt payment story last week to pull off a wildlypopular $70 million stock sale, Boston's famous off-pricefashion retailer and its underwriters at Goldman Sachs gotaway with several things that tend to trouble investors whenthey're in a more cautious mood.</LP><TEXT>   Notably, there were stock sales by Filene's Basementinsiders and LBO partners; 31% of all the money raised wentto insiders, including Filene's Basement's two topexecutives, who sold almost 15% of their shares. There weresluggish sales at established Filene's Basement stores in thefiscal year ended Feb. 2, 1991, and a profit dive in thelatest quarter. And there were strong warnings in the stockprospectus that tight lending agreements might curb Filene'sBasement's plans to keep growing by opening new stores.   Did anybody give a hoot about Filene's Basement's insiderselling or bleak New England sales? No. In last week's hotmarket, underwriter Goldman increased both the size and priceof the offering. The indicated offering price was $11 to $13but the retailer sold 4.8 million shares at $14.50. Even thatwas too low.   Some 6.5 million Filene's Basement shares traded in thenext three days as the hot money types unloaded them athigher prices. The stock closed Friday at 17 5/8, down 5/8,putting the company's value at $325 million. That's aboutdouble the price that Filene's Basement fetched overall in aJuly 1988 leveraged buy-out from Federated Department Stores.   The 19th century founders of the original Filene'sdepartment stores -- Filene's Basement now is totallyseparate -- would have been amazed to see how fast thecompany's value has soared. &quot;Only in a hot market&quot; could thishappen, says one money manager. Shares of RJR Nabisco,Duracell International and other LBO companies going publichave recently been big winners.   &quot;Investors are on this (earnings) momentum kick,&quot; says NewYork money manager John Gordon of Deltec Asset Management.While the best profit is &quot;legitimate earnings growth fromoperations,&quot; he says, some LBO companies that are sellingstock will have an extra &quot;built-in earnings growth if theykeep paying debt.&quot;   Indeed, bulls in some cases are paying higher prices forshares of LBO companies than for others that never piled ontoo much debt. And for the time being, investors seem to beignoring the risk that a company's growth might stall ifbusiness doesn't pick up.   Goldman won't comment on any aspect of the offering, but aFilene's Basement executive says investors have been tolerantof retailers that are struggling in weak states; they knowthat everybody in the Northeast has been having problems, hesays, &quot;but we think we're holding our own.&quot; The company iscutting long-term debt to about $43 million from almost $78million.   In this market, too, says Robert Long, who runs FirstBoston's junk-bond research, &quot;people are willing to lookthrough to the assets&quot; of a company; they &quot;aren't overlydistracted&quot; by such things as insider selling. Most Filene'sBasement insiders who sold shares in the offering were notthe main LBO partners but were associated with formerjunk-bond house Drexel Burnham Lambert, which assisted in the1988 buy-out. Filene's Basement's chairman, Samuel Gerson,and president, Mone Anathan III, sold stock for &quot;liquidity,&quot;says a person close to Filene's Basement.   The retailer has a nice niche in retailing discountdesigner and brand-name clothes and it's consideredwell-managed. But investors today are paying about 34 timesFilene's Basement's profit (excluding special items) of 52cents a share in its latest fiscal year. Dress Barn, anotherwell-known off-price retailer, costs roughly half as much.   Of course, new stocks are sold on forecasts of earningsfar down the road. &quot;In all these deals, no one is looking attrailing earnings -- except you people in the press,&quot; saysone investment banker. One investor who thinks Filene'sBasement could show per-share profit of 85 cents in thecurrent fiscal year and maybe $1.20 in the fiscal year endingin early February 1993 says that on future earnings, &quot;you'repaying in line with Dress Barn&quot; if you buy Filene's Basementtoday.   This money manager, who didn't buy Filene's Basementshares, adds, &quot;But who knows what happens in February 1993?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
