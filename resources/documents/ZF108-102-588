 LasVegas has been called a Disneyland for adults, but that's not being fair toDisney.andP;  Disney theme parks try to stimulate your brain.andP;  The neon jungle ofLas Vegas strives to overwhelm it.andP;  And so does COMDEX.andP;  In mid-November,COMDEX Fall '89, the 10th anniversary edition, drew around 125,000 people,compared to last year's 110,000 and 1987's 100,000.andP;  In five days, over 1,700exhibitors presented more microcomputer products than anyone could truly seein a month.andP;  To increase the challenge, COMDEX strews exhibits all over town.andO;Battling endless traffic jams to move among dozens of hotels, 10 exhibitsites, and numerous meetings by taxi or shuttle bus amplified the frenzy.andO;Locals complained that COMDEX attendees didn't patronize restaurants, seeshows, or gamble much.andP;  So Las Vegas compensated where we were mostvulnerable.andP;  Since there was at least one computer person for every bed insouthern Nevada, many hotels doubled their rates for COMDEX attendees (oursdid).andP;  A favorite COMDEX pastime was playing &quot;my hotel is worse than yourhotel&quot; (if you enjoy mice, holes in the wall, gum on the headboard, stuckcloset doors, and random maid service, we nominate one room at the Sahara).andM;If COMDEX symbolized anything, it was that the new decade will be differentfrom the last one.andP;  According to COMDEX, 80486-based systems will soon raisemicrocomputers to mainframe performance (minis are already dead, they say).andO;With everyone networked (another COMDEX assumption) the client/serverapproach will be the standard database architecture.andP;  EISA (Extended IndustryStandard Architecture) computers finally appeared to challenge IBM's MCA(Micro Channel Architecture), though Intel simultaneously revealed a bug thatputs the 486 back to &quot;coming soon&quot; status for a few months.andP;  Database userswill be well served by the ever-improving performance of network-oriented PChardware.andP;  For example, Everex and Storage Dimensions combined to introduce a386/33 computer system optimized for use as a Novell file server.andM;More and more people claimed OS/2 is coming--really.andP;  With about one percentof PCs running OS/2, the marketplace hasn't agreed so far.andP;  To force theissue, Microsoft and IBM announced an agreement to stub off Windows, killingits prospects to provide many OS/2 capabilities under DOS.andP;  By mutualagreement, only OS/2 will be multi-tasking, an ability many DOS users neednow.andP;  Meanwhile, Quarterdeck offers an alternative.andP;  They announced a new,improved version of its DOS-based multi-tasking DESQview.andP;  But if the trendtowards graphical interfaces continues, Windows and ultimately OS/2Presentation Manager may have the last laugh.andP;  Users may not, since everystep towards bit-mapped screens is another load of dirt on the grave of themajority of PCs.andP;  In the OS/2 world, computers that use 8088, 8086, andslower 80286 processors, and systems with less than 8M of RAM, have no placeat all.andP;  (OS/2 takes 4M to load, 8M to do anything useful.andP;  Microsoft didpromise to fit OS/2 into 3M, and maybe even 2M, &quot;real soon now,&quot; so maybeyou'll only need a 6M 386.)andP;  The future of any 286-based computer is at risk.andO;Computers sporting 386SX processors were everywhere at COMDEX, and may be theentry-level platform of 1990.andM;Laptops, everywhere at COMDEX, continue to grow in power and shrink in size.andO;The most attention was garnered by Atari and Poqet, who offered palm-sizedcomputers, proving there is such a thing as &quot;too small to be usable.&quot;andP;  TinyPCs are intriguing, but more important news is that you can have as muchdatabase development power as you need in a briefcase-sized 386 with ahandle.andP;  If portability is what you want, why own a desktop computer at all?andO;Color, you say?andP;  You can plug a standard color monitor into any good laptop.andO;And several vendors were eager to show their newer-than-new laptops withcolor screens.andP;  By next year they might even be affordable.andM;Database softwareandM;COMDEX is a multi-level show.andP;  A lot of the really fun stuff is shownprivately in suites and meeting rooms.andP;  Some of these prototype productsbarely run, some become dead-ends, while a few eventually are released.andP;  Weoften see the best database software behind closed doors.andM;By spring we should have the new crop of DOS-based dBASE language productsall up and running: dBASE IV 1.1, Clipper 5.0, and FoxPro/LAN 1.0.andP;  (Forinformation about FoxPro, see the extensive feature in this magazine.)andM;Likewise, the dBASE language continues to penetrate the UNIX world.andP;  WordTechSystems demonstrated their new SCO XENIX version of Quicksilver/UNIX, aproduct they claim runs more than twice as fast as SCO FoxBASE+.andP;  FoxPro maybe ported to UNIX in 1990.andP;  Ashton-Tate was rumored to be close to releasinga UNIX version of dBASE IV.andM;Ashton-Tate: The sequelandM;dBASE IV 1.1 made a welcome--but unfinished--appearance at COMDEX.andO;Ashton-Tate showed a dBASE that was significantly faster, with better memorymanagement, improved network support, easier installation and setup,conditional indexes, user interface refinements, and much improveduser-defined function capabilities.andP;  The programming language has beenexpanded with commands like: SAVE/RESTORE SCREEN, REPLACE FROM ARRAY, SETMESSAGE TO andless;screen positionandgt;, and KEYBOARD buffer stuffing.andP;  It's possible totune performance externally, specifying how memory is shared by anapplication and dBASE overlays.andP;  An integrated disk cache option usesextended or expanded (EMS) memory.andP;  Owners of version 1.0 will receive dBASEIV 1.1 free.andP;  And, in case you're wondering, for the moment, the dBASEProfessional Compiler is still &quot;under development.&quot;andM;One reporter had the pleasure of seeing the Ashton-Tate booth from the insideout.andP;  Ashton-Tate invited 18 dBASE-compatible independent software vendors toexhibit their wares.andP;  His particular product was a dBASE-compatible codegenerator.andP;  The experience was sad, indeed.andP;  During his stay, he talked to ahandful of people (three in three hours on the first day of the show) evenremotely interested in dBASE.andP;  One couldn't help but wonder if dBASEprogrammers still look to Ashton-Tate single-handedly for their developmentneeds.andM;dBASE IV, Ashton-Tate, $795, (213) 329-8000.andM;Borland: Revving upandM;Last year Borland showed Data Based Advisor their new Paradox-SQLconnectivity technology, but no product's appeared.andP;  This year, Borlandshowed something more immediately available, the new Paradox database engine,a C library of over 70 functions to access Paradox tables.andP;  Borlanddemonstrated networked computers running a C application, Quattro Pro,Paradox, and Sidekick Plus, all simultaneously sharing common data.andM;The Paradox Engine, Borland International Inc., $495, $295 for registeredusers, (408) 438-8400.andM;Nantucket: Free to be you and meandM;dBASE language programmers who don't want to use the Paradox PAL language canstill take advantage of Borland's technology, thanks to Clipper 5.0.andP;  The newClipper will make it possible to separate applications from the databaseengine, and even to access multiple database engines simultaneously within anapplication.andP;  Though not yet released, Nantucket was able to demonstrateClipper 5.0.andP;  Their Database Driver Series for Clipper offers a driver forParadox files and SQL drivers for Microsoft SQL Server (the one marketed byAshton-Tate), Gupta's SQLBase, and Novell's NetWare SQL.andP;  The Paradox driverallows standard Clipper applications to talk to Paradox tables as if theywere dBASE DBFs.andP;  On a network, the same data can be simultaneously used byother Paradox-compatible programs from Borland and others.andP;  Nantucket seesthis ability to uncouple the front and back ends as Clipper 5.0's majorstrength.andP;  User-defined commands (UDCs) and replaceable database drivers willopen up applications.andP;  If you don't like what they give you, create your own.andO;The drivers will be available soon after Clipper 5.0 ships.andP;  And whateverhappened to the promised Clipper 5.0 release date of Sept. 15?andP;  Nantucketpresident Larry Heimendinger explained that &quot;the product wasn't late; theannouncement was early.&quot;andM;Clipper 5.0, Nantucket Corp., $795, (213) 390-7923.andM;Novell: Strung upandM;Novell dramatically demonstrated the expanded power of NetWare 386 with anexhibit of 250 networked computers.andP;  Novell gave database developers a forumto present early looks at NetWare Loadable Modules (NLMs).andP;  Designingsoftware as an NLM creates a new form of client/server architecture.andP;  NLMsrun on the server, using the server's CPU and RAM, as extensions of NetWare.andO;NLMs range from e-mail services, like cc:Mail, to real-time backup systems todatabase engines, mostly SQL-based, like XDB-Server.andM;A dBASE connection is coming from John Matze.andP;  In the second quarter of 1990,his company, MCCS Software, will release the RoadRunner connectivity series,a dBASE PRG to C code translator, an NLM or VAP server engine to access dBASEand Novell Btrieve files simultaneously, and a dBASE III-compatibleinterpreter front end to access the RoadRunner Engine.andP;  Novell's NetWare SQL(and the NetWare SQL-based FoxServer-FoxPro engine) will also run as anNLM--though only with NetWare 386.andP;  For some firms, that may be the catch.andO;The benefits of the NLM approach are available to those who can justifyspending $8,000 just for NetWare 386, plus the 386 hardware to handle it.andO;NetWare 286 (which costs from $600 to $3,300 and runs on a 286 or 386) usesNLM's noncompatible predecessor, the Value Added Process (VAP).andP;  According toseveral people developing Novell add-ons, converting software to NLM formatis easy.andP;  Writing a VAP is so complicated that few have ever appeared.andP;  (Somenew NLMs may also have VAP versions.)andM;FORCEfulandM;When you hear terms like &quot;variable declarations,&quot; &quot;include files,&quot; &quot;unsignedintegers,&quot; &quot;symbolic debugger compatibility,&quot; &quot;conditional compilation,&quot; and&quot;native code generation,&quot; you probably yawn and think you've heard anannouncement for yet another C compiler.andP;  This time it's the introduction ofFORCE, the dBASE-language compiler from Sophco, Inc.andM;We remember the introduction of FORCE III back at COMDEX/Fall '87.andP;  Theproduct's finally selling.andP;  What have they got?andP;  The company's removed theone ever-nagging feature of dBASE that makes compiler writers jump out oftheir skin--macro/text substitution using the andamp; construct.andP;  Agreed, this is anice feature in the language.andP;  But with the newer compilers on the market,there are fewer reasons for using it (like array simulation).andP;  You couldargue that the pluses outweigh the negatives if it's removed (the andamp; slowsdown a compiler to ridiculously low levels).andP;  On top of that, they've thrownin features and extensions like the ADDITIVE keyword used with SET FILTER TOand SET RELATION TO.andM;Should you make the switch to FORCE?andP;  We can think of two reasons for doingso (though, remember, this isn't a review of the product): First, as theproduct's billing goes, FORCE is &quot;the first native-code compiler for thedBASE language.&quot;andP;  Sophco really means that the resulting EXE file doesn'tblindly include the massive runtime code that both Clipper and Quicksilverdo.andP;  A one-line program that displays a message to the screen like:andM;?&quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;andM;is only about 2K with FORCE, compared to 156K using Clipper.andM;Second, because of this reduced overhead, the executables built by FORCE runat speeds in the league of C programs.andP;  Sophco publishes benchmarks againstClipper, in which FORCE outperformed Clipper in various tests, includingINDEXing, SKIPping, SEEKing, and non-I/O related activities.andM;FORCE, Sophco, Inc., $695, (800) 922-3001 and (303) 444-1542.andM;CscapeandM;Raima's db VISTA III, a C function library for database management, adds anew twist with its support of Microsoft Windows 2.0 memory managementstandards.andP;  This lets you develop &quot;well-behaved Windows applications.&quot;andO;Before the end of the year, a new version of the db VISTA database enginewill be released that also supports dynamic link libraries.andP;  Stronglypositioned in the Windows market, db VISTA III will support Windows 3.0 andOS/2 Presentation Manager.andM;db VISTA III, Raima Corp., $695 and up, depending on operating system, (206)747-5570.andM;Multiuser dBASEandM;Cykic Software released version 3.0 of its multiuser dBASE compiler,MultiBase.andP;  The new version lets you run dBASE apps with up to 30 users froma single 286.andP;  Terminals are connected through serial ports and standardcables.andP;  The company touts its software as being especially useful for dBASEaccounting work.andM;MultiBase, Cykic Software, $899, (619) 297-0182.andM;fileProgressandM;The Small Computer Company announced filePro Plus 4.0, scheduled for shipmentby the time you read this.andP;  filePro crosses hardware boundaries and runs onDOS, OS/2, UNIX/XENIX, AIX, ULTRIX, VMS, and SUN OS.andP;  New features includemethods for creating pop-up windows that will appear the same to users nomatter what platform they're using.andP;  Also new is the &quot;fuzzy scan&quot; technologyin its browse function.andP;  Fuzzy scan is a patented phonetic searchingtechnology from Proximity Technologies of Friendly Finder fame.andM;filePro, The Small Computer Company, Inc., $990 to $40,000 depending onsystem, (914) 769-3160.andM;An old friend returnsandM;One of the earliest database managers we ever tried was Advanced DB Master,from Macon Systems, Inc.andP;  Well, the product's still around, and we just got alook at its latest release, version 4.0.andP;  This multifile, table-driven systemlets you create applications by making selections from menus.andP;  You can evendefine your own menus to drive it.andP;  It uses the hierarchical structure formaintaining multiple key fields and handles extremely large databases throughan interesting (and fast) compression scheme.andM;Reporter-at-largeandM;We've always been a big fan of dBASE accounting software.andP;  First, you can buythe source code and modify it if it doesn't conform to the way you doaccounting.andP;  Second, if the stock system fails to supply you with the reportsyou need, then you can define reports with report writers built into dBASE orsome third-party report writer.andM;That's where On Top from Automation Resources comes in.andP;  It's report writerand query processor that compliments SourceMate's AccountMate library.andP;  It'salso a nice stand-alone report writer.andP;  Users and developers can easilydefine new reports and queries with it.andP;  Instead of making users deal withthe often terse dBASE field names to define a report, On Top uses the moremeaningful English field descriptions stored in a data dictionary configuredby the developer.andP;  Query results can be printed, displayed, or written to anASCII file.andP;  You can execute On Top from the DOS prompt or from within adBASE application using the RUN command (its size is 273K).andM;If you're already using a dBASE accounting system, On Top may be a goodaddition.andP;  If you're a developer, On Top might be nice to include with yourapplication to give users added flexibility when it comes to reporting.andM;On Top, Automation Resources, $349, (800) 289-9290.andM;The Randamp;R Relational Report Writer from Concentric Data Systems has beenconsistently viewed as the premier report writer for dBASE developers.andP;  Heck,Ashton-Tate liked it so much, they added its familiar &quot;band&quot; technology todBASE IV.andP;  Now they're trying to top themselves with the Randamp;R Code Generator,which steals from dBASE IV.andP;  Now you not only get the reports that the reportwriter spits out, you also get the dBASE source code for the programs thatprint them.andP;  You just give the code generator the name of the Randamp;R report andan output file name and, presto, you have a program, fully operational anddebugged, nicely structured, with comments.andP;  Randamp;R Code Generator writes codefor dBASE IV, Clipper, FoxBASE+, dBXL, and Quicksilver.andM;Randamp;R Relational Report Writer, Concentric Data Systems, Inc., $149, (508)366-1122.andM;VantagePoint by DataAccess is described as a SQL report writer for DataFlex.andO;After sitting through a long demo of the product, we'd say they've done agood job.andP;  Using an integrated SAA/CUA interface, you define your reportssimply by choosing options--including setting up relations.andP;  VantagePointgenerates the SQL commands.andP;  You can run the commands as-is or modify them.andO;You can even enter ANSI SQL commands in a special &quot;SQL window.&quot;andP;  VantagePointannounced it will ship in the first quarter of 1990.andM;VantagePoint, DataAccess Corp., $295 single user, $595 multiuser, (800)451-FLEX.andM;dBASE's dictionaryandM;Lamaura Development Limited, a UK firm, demoed their Data Dictionary for thedBASE language.andP;  The program holds the characteristics of databases withinapplications in a central location for easy maintenance, fast documentation,and automatic creation of data tables.andP;  The Data Dictionary also works onnetworks.andP;  You may remember the company, if you've ever heard of SOS Help!, aClipper add-on library that lets developers produce context-sensitive helpfor Clipper systems.andP;  The company's seeking U.S.andP;  distribution, so until thatproblem is solved, you've got to call the UK for more information.andM;Lamaura Data Dictionary, Lamaura Development Ltd., U.K., (011) 44-0707 43278,$350 single user; about $900 multiuser; about $1,800 for 25 users; about$2,700 for a 99-user system.andM;Painless EXTRACTionandM;We discovered this useful developer's utility while hanging around theAshton-Tate booth.andP;  Someone walked up and showed it to us (who says you needa booth to get attention?)andP;  EXTRACT is sort of a &quot;reverse report generator.&quot;andO;It takes reports as ASCII text files and writes some or all of the data intoDBF, WK1, delimited, or SDF format files.andP;  You begin by defining what thereport looks like using its report description language.andP;  You can code thelanguage or have EXTRACT generate it through a very slick menu-driveninterface.andP;  Then you let EXTRACT have at it.andP;  The program scans through thereport, picking up key pieces of data and building the requested type ofoutput file.andP;  If you choose an ASCII delimited file, you can import it intoany software that supports that format (which is most these days).andP;  And itseems quick.andP;  Not only can you process columnar-style reports but EXTRACT canscan through files containing payroll checks, customer statements, and evenBBS log files.andM;During the import process, you can set up EXTRACT to automatically &quot;code&quot;certain fields, so you can have a customer code inserted into the databaseinstead of the customer name that appears on the report.andP;  You can also writedata to multiple output files from a single report.andP;  This means it cansupport multi-file database organization, since data appearing on a reportmay need to go to different databases.andP;  Second, you can use EXTRACT to take areport generated from a flat-file data manager and turn the data loose in amulti-file database system.andM;Since EXTRACT reads ASCII files, mainframe data is also within reach.andP;  Justtake a report generated by a mainframe and use EXTRACT to build the databasesfor processing on your PC.andM;EXTRACT, Datatrope Corp., $279, (213) 477-8055.andM;CAUSE and EFFECTandM;CAUSE The Professional Programmer, a database application developmentenvironment and CASE tool from Maxem, seems to be going strong.andP;  A catalog of17 EFFECTS (CAUSE applications) was introduced at COMDEX.andP;  The targetapplication areas for the new applications include accounting, education,real estate, and sales management.andP;  A new package, appropriately namedNetEFFECT, gives the CAUSE environment multiuser capabilities and includes adatabase server application installed on the network server hardware.andP;  CAUSEis available for both DOS and Macintosh environments.andM;CAUSE $295, NetEFFECT $99.95, EFFECTS $29.95 to $99.95, Maxem Corp. (602)491-2466.andM;Windows and SQLandM;SQL continues to be the buzzword of the year as Coromandel announced a SQLlibrary for Microsoft Windows called WinSQL/API.andP;  Based on the client/serverarchitecture, this library includes data definition language and datamanipulation language statements that can be embedded in C applications.andP;  Aprecompiler translates the SQL statements into Windows Dynamic Data Exchangecalls.andP;  This means a SQL call (distinguished by an EXEC SQL prefix) generatesa DDE message to the server.andP;  The server then processes the query or updateoperation and returns the results to the client.andM;WinSQL/API, Coromandel Industries, Inc., $495 introductory, (718) 997-0699.andM;Access SQLandM;Also jumping on the SQL bandwagon is Software Products International withAccess SQL, a database management system using client/server architecture.andO;This Microsoft Windows-based SQL system should be available by the time youread this.andP;  Access SQL is targeted at the corporate user who has littletechnical experience or knowledge of SQL.andP;  It lets users build seamless entryforms that accept and direct data to multiple databases.andP;  Access SQL comeswith the typical development aids such as table definition functions, networkadministration utilities, and import/export capabilities.andM;Access SQL, Software Products International, $1,595 for one to four users,(619) 450-1526.andM;And more windowsandM;Precision Software announced their release of Superbase 4 Windows, a formdesign, application development, and multi-file database management systemfor Windows.andP;  Naturally, you can use all the those unique little Windowsymbols in your apps, as well as macros, function keys, and reportingcapabilities through SQL-type clauses.andP;  The program lets you report on bothSuperbase and DBASE files simultaneously and comes with its own run-timeversion of Microsoft Windows.andM;Superbase 4 Windows, Precision Software, $695 single user; $995 five-1ser LANPack, (800) 562-9909 or (214) 929-4888.andM;Plain vanilla SQLandM;Quadbase Systems, the company that brought us the dBASE/SQL query tool,dQUERY, announced Quadbase-SQL, a development environment for C programmers.andO;The package includes a SQL database engine, a display management subsystem,an embedded SQL preprocessor for C, and a development toolbox.andP;  The SQLfunctions supported by Quadbase-SQL are fully compliant with the ANSI SQL-86level 2 standard.andP;  The software directly accesses dBASE IV (including indexfiles), Lotus 1-2-3, Symphony, FoxBASE+, and Clipper files.andP;  The new dQUERY3.0, which uses the same SQL engine, is included with Quadbase-SQL.andM;Quadbase-SQL, Quadbase Systems, Inc., $795, (408) 738-6989.andM;SpellCheckerandM;It was good to see Jake Geller of Fox andamp; Geller fame back in the fray with hislatest developer's aid, SpellCode.andP;  As programmers we rather liked the ideaof a spell checker for programs.andP;  SpellCode takes another step towardspelling bliss by correcting your data too.andP;  It can go into a DBF with itsmemo field attached and spell check them.andP;  SpellCode isn't just for dBASEfolks either.andP;  In addition to its English dictionary it has special keyworddictionaries for all the major development languages (C, BASIC, FORTRAN,Paradox, and others).andP;  Its personal dictionaries, that enable you to add tothe vocabulary, are a nice touch.andM;SpellCode, Geller Software Labs, Inc., $49.95, (201) 746-7402.andM;VP-Expert/SQLandM;From their small, no frills booth, Paperback Software demonstrated their newentry into the SQL database market, a SQL interface for their expertdevelopment system, VP-Expert.andP;  VP-Expert already had database hooks to DBFfiles, but now it offers the capability to interface with SQL databases.andO;VP-Expert uses the Gupta SQLBase database server.andP;  And you don't have to knowSQL to use the SQL engine.andP;  VP-Expert/SQL generates the SQL commandsautomatically.andP;  In debug mode, you can preview the generated SQL commands asthey're sent to the SQLBase server.andP;  The company currently includes a freecopy of the single-user version of SQLBase with a purchase of VP-Expert/SQL.andM;WallSoft: Touch andamp; GoandM;New from WallSoft Systems is U12 Touch andamp; Go, a non-programmer's version ofthe U12 Developer's Release.andP;  It doesn't contain a template compiler.andP;  Touchandamp; Go comes with a library of standard templates, developed by RytekInternational, which allow non-programmers to generate a variety ofcustomized applications with multiple files, multiple users, pop-up scrollingwindows, and table loopups.andP;  The company representative I spoke to reportedthat source code for the templates wouldn't be included.andP;  Touch andamp; Go supportsdBASE III PLUS, dBASE IV, FoxBASE+, FoxPro, Quicksilver, dBXL, and Clipperand will ship &quot;sometime after the first of 1990.&quot;andM;WallSoft also announced a set of C templates for U12.andP;  These C templatesincorporate the dBASE functions from the Code Base 4 C library from SequiterSoftware.andM;U12 Touch andamp; Go.andP;  WallSoft Systems, Inc., $395, (212) 406-7026.andM;SkyFAXandM;We found SkyFAX from Skyworld Technology, a Hong Kong-based company, veryinteresting.andP;  SkyFAX, described as &quot;the dBASE compatible fax board,&quot; is ahalf-length expansion board for IBM and compatible PCs.andP;  Its accompanyingsoftware allows you to merge data from dBASE III PLUS or dBASEIV data fileswith letters, then fax them from your computer.andM;SkyFAX, Skyworld Technology Ltd., $399, (408) 446-9392.andM;OnCmd and CandM;A new collection of C routines for developers using the OnCmd dBASE IIIPLUS-compatible interpreter/compiler for the QNX operating system surfacedduring the show.andP;  It's now available for DOS.andP;  The OnCmd ApplicationProgramming Interface (API) allows direct access to OnCmd database files fromC programs.andP;  OnCmd, described as a compiler, is really a pseudocodeinterpreter with Clipper-style extensions to the dBASE language.andP;  OnCmd hasbeen around since 1987.andP;  QNX is a special purpose, high-performance platformfor developing software in real-time environments.andM;OnCmd C Routines, On Line Data, $550, Canada, (519) 579-3930.andM;Picture showandM;We rather like image database software.andP;  The thought of having pictures toenhance textual data stimulates our creative juices.andP;  PictureWare now offersPicturePower 3.1, which supports Super VGA (SVGA) boards for prividingphotographic quality images.andP;  The new version also has an enhanced internaldatabase manager that allows for easy querying.andP;  Iths compatible with dBASEIII PLUS, Clipper, FoxBASE+, and any database or application capable ofmaking C language calls.andM;Included with the new PicturePower package is PPACCESS, an interface modulethat gives you access to PicturePower's forms and picture databases fromwithin dBASE-language applications.andP;  PPACCESS makes it simple to add picturefields to databases.andP;  Just create a character field with the letters DBP atthe beginning of its name (like DBP EMPLOY) and include it in the databasestructure.andP;  Next, create a display form using PicturePower's form creationprogram, and have PicturePower capture the pictures (a process that requiresa video camera and an image capture/display board) and add them to thedatabase.andM;PicturePower, Pictureware, Inc., $1,995, (215) 667-0880.andM;What about next year?andM;Is COMDEX getting too big, too spread-out too crowded, too disorganized, tooeclectic?andP;  Yes, but what's the alternative?andP;  For those who hate crowds, thenext COMDEX, the junior-grade Spring edition, appears in Atlanta from June 3to 6.andP;  It's half the size, and nowhere near as tacky as Las Vegas.andP;  ButCOMDEX is still COMDEX.andP;  We'll see you there.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
