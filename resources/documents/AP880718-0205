Anglican Bishop Trevor Huddleston, president of theAnti-Apartheid Movement, led Christians, Buddhist monks, a rabbiand a Moslem scholar in prayers for Mandela at London's St. JamesPiccadilly Church.   A cake with 70 candles was on display and the 400 worshiperssigned a 70-square-foot birthday card. Also present were 25activists who had marched about 600 miles from Glasgow, Scotland.   Britain's Anti-Apartheid Movement said it left 25 boxes of cardsin the lobby of the South African Embassy on Trafalgar Square afterguards refused to accept them for relay to South African PresidentP.W. Botha.   The boxes were kicked back into the street and then put in atrash bin, said Karen Talbot, an Anti-Apartheid Movementspokeswoman.   Embassy counselor Henry Raubenheimer said the embassy onlyaccepted petitions that came by mail. ``They (the campaigners) saidthey didn't want to take the boxes back and they couldn't liearound so we put them in the dustbin,'' he said.

Special Committeeagainst Apartheid, said in New York: ``How many more black SouthAfricans ... will serve undefined jail terms before the worldstands up to proclaim that enough is enough?''   In Santa Barbara, Calif., where President Reagan is vacationing,the White House pres office said Mandela ``is widely recognized asthe embodiment of black aspirations in South Africa.''   ``While he and other political leaders remain in prison, SouthAfrican government plans for political reform are not likely togain any significant support from the black community,'' thestatement said.   ``We renew our appeal to the government of South Africa torelease Nelson Mandela and the other political prisoners.''   In Lusaka, Zambia, where the African National Congress has itsexile headquarters, thousands of students marched and burnedeffigies of President P.W. Botha of South Africa, President Reaganand Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain. The students wantharsher U.S. and British economic measures imposed against SouthAfrica.
