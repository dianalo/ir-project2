McCANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Air Line Pilots Association has told itsUnited Airlines members they have difficult choices ahead amidreports the union and the carrier are considering plans including anemployee-owned stake in the company.   ALPA Chairman Rick Dubinsky said in a letter to union membersTuesday that United's parent, UAL Corp. _ which has received a $5.4billion, $240-a-share takeover proposal from investor Marvin Davis _undoubtedly will be bought out by somebody.   ``In fact, whether you like it or not, you and all the otheremployees are going to help pay for it,'' Dubinsky said. ``The onlychoice is whether we buy it for someone else or ourselves.''   He said United pilots may have to ``act rapidly, decisively andconclusively to assure our survival and prosperity,'' notingacquisition by an outsider likely would mean a leveraged buyout thatcould saddle the company with loads of new debt.   ``We must watch this situation very closely, insuring that wehave all the information we need to make the difficult choices thatare inevitable,'' Dubinsky said.   UAL stock closed $4.25 lower at $254.25 a share on the New YorkStock Exchange.   Several news reports indicated ALPA and UAL officials met duringthe weekend to discuss a plans for either a management-employeebuyout or recapitalization that would put a big enough block of UALstock in an employee stock ownership plan to help block any hostiletakeover attempt.   Spokesmen for UAL and ALPA refused to comment Tuesday on whethermeetings were held during the weekend or on reports of the purportedplans.   ``There's nothing out there to make me feel tremendouslyuncomfortable,'' said John Peterpaul, vice president of theInternational Association of Machinists, referring to the reporteddiscussions on a buyout plan. ``We're sitting here watching it.''   The Machinists union represents mechanics at United and otherairlines. The third union representing United employees, theAssociation of Flight Attendants, did not return phone calls seekingcomment.   Dubinsky said in his letter that the level of contribution to anyESOP plan by the pilots would depend on the number of employees andemployee groups participating.   ``Depending on the declared interest of the other employees, wemay need a great level of participation or a slight level,'' hisletter read. ``It would make good sense for you to be financiallyprepared for the worst.''   United's pilots in the past have expressed an interest in buyingthe company, and in 1987 proposed a $4.5 billion plan to buy theairline from its then-parent Allegis Corp. Last week ALPA officialssaid its advisers were being consulted about the Davis bid.   In addition to Davis, New York-based Pan Am Corp. has expressedinterest in a possible merger with UAL.   Louis Marckesano, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.,said a deal involving UAL management and its employees wouldeliminate fears in Congress and the Department of Transportationthat the airline would be stripped of valuable assets, as mighthappen with a leveraged buyout.   A leveraged buyout is an acquisition financed mainly by borrowedfunds that are repaid with the target company's cash flow or thesale of its assets.   ``With that kind of plan, you would assure continuation of UAL asa strong airline,'' he said, referring to a management-labor buyout.``It would create labor peace, which would be pretty important inthe future.''</TEXT></DOC>
