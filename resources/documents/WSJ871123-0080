However, the eight-year struggle over the 6.8 million shares between Mr. Hilton and a foundation set up by his late father Conrad Hilton is likely to continue, although IRS officials couldn't be reached for comment on whether the agency would appeal. It also is uncertain how the court decision might affect a probate court decision last year against Mr. Hilton that was based on the IRS ruling.    Conrad Hilton, founder of the hotel chain, bequeathed the shares to the foundation named for himself that was primarily to benefit Roman Catholic nuns world-wide. In court documents, Barron Hilton has claimed that an option in his father's will supersedes the foundation bequest, giving him the right to buy the shares.    Mr. Hilton claims the right to pay $165 million for the shares, representing their value at the time of his father's death in 1979. The market value is about $477 million, based on the $70.125-a-share closing stock price in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday.    The IRS rulings, made in January and February of 1986, allowed the foundation to convert to a so-called public support organization, permitting it to avoid a legal limit of 20% on the number of Hilton shares it could hold. The rulings helped pave the way for an April 1986 probate court ruling that awarded the disputed shares to the foundation.    Mr. Hilton has appealed the probate court ruling. Meanwhile, the disputed shares remain in the Conrad Hilton estate. </TEXT></DOC>
