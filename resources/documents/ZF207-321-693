 The research center will helpthe service make the best use of its supercomputers and parallel systems overthe next five years.andM;The contractor also would set up a multiuser environment with new and usedhigh-performance computers and a network connecting the center to local andremote sites.andP;  In addition, the contractor will provide consultants to helpArmy scientists &quot;more productively use supercomputers and other advancedarchitectures,&quot; program documents said.andM;Although similar projects exist in other defense and civilian agencies, theArmy center will focus its research in areas of special interest to the Army,a project document said.andP;  It said the center will permit the Army, ratherthan other government organizations, to direct research into areas importantto the service.andM;Patty Cannan, a contract specialist working on the project, said she couldnot estimate the value of the contract.andM;Col.andP;  Arthur Phaup, project manager for the Army's supercomputer program,said service officials expect to have four supercomputers in operation by theend of the year.andP;  At a pre-solicitation conference last month at the ArmyLaboratory Command (ALC) in Adelphi, Md., Phaup said the service will installthis year a Class VII supercomputer at the Army Corps of Engineers WaterwaysExperiment Station in Vicksburg, Miss.andM;The service currently has three Cray Research Inc. supercomputers inoperation.andP;  A Cray X-MP/48 and a Cray-2 have been installed at the BallisticResearch Laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Md.andP;  Anothercray-2 was installed at the Tank-Automotive Command in Warren, Michigan.andM;Phaup said the contractor will help Army researchers use the four machinesbetter by sharing its academic expertise.andM;Col.andP;  Robert Walker, deputy commander of ALC, said more than 25 academicorganizations have expressed interest in the program.andP;  Patricia Silsby, acontracting officer on the project, told vendors their bids would be due inApril and a contract will be awarded late in August.andM;A program document said the service will use supercomputers to meet its&quot;grand challenges,&quot; including efforts to defeat advances in Soviet armor,improve U.S.andP;  armor, increase air defense, get nuclear artillery on thebattlefield, adopt a chemical defense plan and improve conventionalmunitions.andP;  The document said high-speed supercomputers with vast memory willbe &quot;an essential ingredient&quot; needed to meet these challenges.andP;  The centerwill &quot;ensure that the Army's supercomputing competence and performance&quot; keepsup with the emerging supercomputer technology.andM;The document said the contractor will research how best to use powerfulcomputers as a tool for designing and calculating the effects of weaponssystems as well as for target identification and machine vision.andP;  Other areasof focus will include armor and anti-armor design, biomedical research,complex battle management and large-scale combat simulation.andM;It said scientists do not yet completely understand the underying problemsthey will encounter in many of these areas.andP;  &quot;Obtaining such understanding ispart of the research problem&quot; the contractor will address, it said.andM;To get its research into the hands of the Army supercomputing community, thecontractor also will be required to publish its research, conduct symposiumsand establish a fellowship program to train students in research important tothe Army.andM;The RFP also calls for acquisition of UNIX-like high-performance computers tosupport the service's research environment.andP;  Systems will be installed at thecontractor's facility in either a local or distributed configuration.andP;  Thecontractor will provide a local area network in addition to gateways toconnect the center to Army laboratories and other universities and governmentagencies.andP;  A high-speed network, operating at more than 10M per second, willconnect the systems to the low-speed LAN, operating at no more than 10M persecond.andM;The RFP also calls for gateways to the Defense Data Network, the ArmySupercomputer Network, the National Science Foundation Network, the AdvancedResearch Projects Agency Network and dial-in modem service.andM;The contracotr will conduct seminars and courses to instruct Army users onthese systems.andP;  It also will set up a hotline to answer users' questionsregarding programming languages, mathematics programming codes and libraries,engineering applications, system libraries, editors and graphics andanimation packages.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
