Rept 99-256, accompanying the fiscal year 1986 AppropriationsAct, the Committee requested FAA to report on various alternative policyoptions that might accelerate the modernization of the commercial aircraftfleet so as to reduce aircraft noise levels still adversely affecting manymetropolitan areas. FAA's report, dated April 11, 1986, listed a numberof options that could encourage or require replacement of noisier Stage2 aircraft with quieter, more modern Stage 3 aircraft but offered no recommendationas to whether the federal government should take steps to achieve thatobjective:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A number of events occurred in the two years since that report, <T3>Alternatives Available to Accelerate Commercial Aircraft Fleet Modernization,</T3>was completed that suggest that it should now be updated. Technology forthe reengining of Stage 2 aircraft to Stage 3 noise levels has been advancedand additional communities have felt the need to impose local noise regulationsin the absence of any national program of noise relief. Most importantly,debate as to the appropriate ``useful life'' of Stage 2 transport aircraftfor noise or safety reasons has been reopened by the recent Aloha Airlinesincident involving an older B-737 aircraft.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The committee directs the FAA to update its past report within ninemonths and, after consultation with interested parties, to discuss whetherpublic policy in both aircraft noise abatement and aviation safety mightbe advanced by imposing a deadline, to be determined through rulemaking,for operations of older Stage 2 aircraft in the fleet.</ITAG>In response to this direction, the FAA has decided to open a public docketto afford all interested parties an opportunity to present their viewson the subject.<T3>Issues:</T3> The FAA seeks information on workable and practical alternatives(and combinations thereof) to best achieve the ends described by the Committee.The FAA also invites the submission of any available corroborative datawhich demonstrates the efficacy of these alternatives.No reasonable linkage between limiting operation, for noise abatement purposes,of Stage 2 airplanes with the safety of aging airplanes has been established.Inspection and structural repair and replacement actions are being implementedto assure safety of aging aircraft without imposing useful life limits,but the FAA is also continuing to study the aging aircraft issue and maybe developing further programs and recommendations on this matter.Among the alternatives that might be considered are those described inthe following paragraphs. They are included only to stimulate considerationof a wide range of possible alternative actions and, as such, do not themselvesrepresent proposals or suggestions from the FAA. The public is invitedto submit additional alternatives.<ITAG tagnum="84">Possible Alternative Areas for Consideration</ITAG><T3>Policy Options.</T3> Should a national program to accelerate the phaseout of Stage 2 aircraft be developed? If so, should the program be linkedto a program which bars further limitations on Stage 2 aircraft operationsduring the phase-out period at:All U.S. airports?All international airports?All non-noise-sensitive airports?How should the accelerated phase-out be coordinated with the restrictionson operational limitations?<T3>Technology Options.</T3> What is the economic and technical feasibilityof retrofit and/or re-engining programs for various current Stage 2 airplanes?What progress has been made in the development of noise abatement technology,and could that technology support aircraft noise standards more stringentthan Stage 3?<T3>Regulatory Options.</T3> If a policy were adopted for limiting furtheroperation of Stage 2 aircraft, how might such regulations be crafted? Forinstance, such actions might include setting age limits for specific aircraftor engine types, limiting the number of operating cycles, or simply settingone or more specific date(s) for cessation of operations. Other regulatoryoptions might include limitations on future production or import (registration).If further study shows a need for more costly inspection and maintenanceprograms to assure safety of older aircraft, how would the economics ofthose programs affect decisions on early phase out of Stage 2 aircraft?<T3>Financial Options.</T3> Should any financial incentives be consideredto support accelerating the conversion of U.S. fleets? If so, would incentives,such as, depreciation or investment tax credits for quite Stage 3 aircraft,Federal or local noise fees and surcharges, or establishment of a NoiseTrust Fund to underwrite new aircraft purchases be appropriate? Under whatconditions would the economies of operation of Stage 3 aircraft compensatefor the added capital cost of early replacement?<ITAG tagnum="6">J.E.
