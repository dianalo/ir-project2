There is a profound ironyand lesson in this, because Christmas celebrates the coming of aSavior who was born without a home.   There was no room at the inn for the holy family. Weary oftravel, a young Mary close to childbirth and her carpenter husbandJoseph found but the rude shelter of a stable. There was born theKing of Kings, the Prince of Peace _ an event on which all historywould turn. Jesus would again be without a home, and more than once;on the flight to Egypt and during his public ministry, when he said,``The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but theson of man hath not where to lay his head.''   From his very infancy on, our Redeemer was reminding us that fromthen on we would never lack a home in him. Like the shepherds towhom the angel of the Lord appeared on the first Christmas Day, wecould always say, ``Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see thisthing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known untous.''   As we come home with gladness of family and friends thisChristmas, let us also remember our neighbors who cannot go homethemselves. Our compassion and concern this Christmas and all yearlong will mean much to the hospitalized, the homeless, theconvalescent, the orphaned _ and will surely lead us on our way tothe joy and peace of Bethlehem and the Christ Child who bids uscome. For it is only in finding and living the eternal meaning ofthe Nativity that we can be truly happy, truly at peace, truly home.   Merry Christmas, and God bless you!   @s@ Ronald Reagan</TEXT></DOC>
