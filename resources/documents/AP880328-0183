Information Minister Ali al-Shaer quoted Fahd as telling hisCabinet at a regularly scheduled meeting, ``Saudi Arabia will goahead with its ratified defense programs and will pursue itsIslamic mission and Arab duties.''   Shaer said the Cabinet reviewed ``solidarity'' with the kingdomexpressed by most Arab governments after ``repeated Israeli threatsto strike at the missiles that the kingdom has bought to defend itssoil and sacred shrines.''   Saudi Arabia confirmed last week it bought CSS-2 missiles, witha range of 2,200 miles, from China, but said it would not putnuclear warheads on them.   It said it wanted to diversify its arsenal.   The kingdom's shipping lanes have been menaced by spilloversfrom the Iraq-Iran war. Iran accuses Saudi Arabia of aiding Iraqand has made threats against the kingdom.   The Washington Post said last week Israel might carry out apre-emptive strike against the missiles.   Yossi Ben Aharon, a top aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ofIsrael, warned that Israel had the reputation of ``not waiting tillpotential dangers become a reality.''   He was apparently referring to Israel's 1981 pre-emptive strikeagainst a nuclear reactor under construction in Iraq.   Saudi Arabia, like most Arab countries, is technically at warwith Israel. Support received by Saudi Arabia after the Israelithreats included a message from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,whose country is the only Arab nation to make peace with Israel.   The state-run newspaper Al-Ittihad in Abu Dhabi, capital of theUnited Arab Emirates, reported Monday that Fahd would visit Egypton April 4 to discuss the Israeli statements with Mubarak. Itquoted diplomatic sources in Cairo.   There was no official confirmation from Cairo or Riyadh.</TEXT></DOC>
