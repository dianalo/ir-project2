Hart left the campaign last May after disclosure of hisrelationship with model Donna Rice but then rejoined it inDecember, declaring, ``Let the people decide.''   Today in Denver, as he withdrew again, he said the people hadhad their say: ``Clearly I should not go forward.''   Hart failed to win any delegates in the primaries and caucuses,polled no more than 5 percent of the vote in any of the SuperTuesday primaries and lost his eligibility for further federalmatching funds.   ``My friends and supporters have given the word `loyalty' newmeaning,'' he said. ``They've toiled tirelessly in an uphillfight.''   Dole said today in remarks to Illinois Farm Bureau leaders, ``Iwant to make certain you understand I am in this race.'' Pressreports had noted he had taken his television ads off the air inIllinois and had drastically cut his campaign staff after beingbeaten by Vice President George Bush in 16 Super Tuesday contests.   Noting those reports, he said today, ``It's hard to focus on theissues sometimes because the press won't let us do that. They wouldrather write about how many staff you reduced your numbers by. Inever thought that a campaign was a jobs program.''   In Peoria, Robertson said, ``I'm in it until New Orleans (siteof the Republican National Convention). It looks overwhelming forone of the Republican candidates, but Goliath was prettyoverwhelming as well. We're going to win.''   Five days before the Illinois primary, Democratic candidatesparticipated in a televised forum Thursday night, but in contrastto many of their joint appearances, not a cross word was exchanged.   It was ``all sweetness and light,'' said Illinois Sen. PaulSimon after the forum sponsored by WLS-TV and the Roosevelt Centerfor American Policy Studies.   Simon greeted people eating breakfast today at the Golden NuggetPancake House on the North Side of Chicago and predicted theDemocratic convention would need at least two ballots to choose itspresidential nominee.   ``I think I have as good a chance as anyone,'' he said.   Then Simon stopped by the Polish National Alliance where hereceived the endorsement of the Polish Daily Zgoda, a Polishlanguage newspaper.   A Washington Post-ABC News poll published today but conductedWednesday, the day after the Super Tuesday primaries and six daysbefore Illinois votes, said Vice President George Bush had thesupport of 58 percent of Republicans.   On the Democratic side, Simon was backed by 38 percent of thelikely voters surveyed and Chicago-based Jesse Jackson had supportof 33 percent. The figures for Simon and Jackson were well withinthe 8 percentage point margin of error.   In Alaska, Democratic officials said today that Jackson finishedfirst in the state's precinct caucuses, posting a narrow victoryover Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in a nonbinding preferencepoll, 34.9 percent to 31 percent.   Uncommitted caucus delegates ran a close third, with the othercandidates far behind.   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York ended his presidential bid onThursday and said the idea of being the Republican candidate forvice president was ``a very flattering and awesome thought.''   Kemp declined to endorse any of the surviving candidates _ Bush,Dole and Pat Robertson _ describing them all as ``Reaganconservatives.''   Dole scotched rumors that he was about to join Kemp on thecampaign sidelines.   ``Bob Dole's no dropout,'' he said in a statement issued inWashington and Illinois. ``I'm in this one to win.''   Bush beat Dole in all 16 Super Tuesday primaries and now has 705national convention delegates compared to 165 for the Kansassenator.   Dole did not say whether he would remain in the race if he losesto Bush in Illinois but an aide said, ``I think it's clear to Dolethat it's do or die.''   Dole canceled all television commercials in Illinois and ordereddeep layoffs in his staff. An aide said the campaign wasconsidering airing a 30-minute paid broadcast in the closing hoursof the campaign.   One bright spot for the Kansas senator was the endorsement ofthe Chicago Tribune which said that Bush's identification withPresident Reagan, while a big help in Republican primary contests,might be a handicap in the general election.   ``Nowhere have the Republican candidates asked or answered thekind of harsh questions the Democrats surely will raise in Novemberabout the Reagan administration, whose colors Mr. Bush has beenable to wave more furiously than anyone else,'' the newspaper saidin an editorial headlined, ``Why Illinois Should Pick Dole.''   Robertson, who also had a disappointing day on Super Tuesday,also ordered deep staff cuts.   ``We want to stay lean and mean,'' he said, declining to givethe number of employees laid off.   The vice president also was campaigning in the state in advanceof Tuesday's primary. Illinois voters will elect delegates and alsoexpress their preferences in a beauty contest on the ballot.   Bush told a Governors Club luncheon in Chicago that he was``tired of being embarrassed'' by scandals involving governmentofficials and he called for establishment of a White House ethicspanel.   Bush has refused, however, to criticize any administrationofficials, including Attorney General Edwin Meese III, who havecome under investigation by grand juries.</TEXT></DOC>
