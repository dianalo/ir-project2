(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A long-time political activist saidWednesday he has been the target of three break-ins in as manyweeks and believes they were politically motivated.   Chris Wood, who has been active in the Vermont RainbowCoalition, the Vermont Committee on Southern Africa and the VermontCentral America Non-Intervention Network, said the break-insoccurred this month at his home, former office and current office.   He and a spokeswoman for a New York group that defends the civilrights of activists said the break-ins fit the pattern of more than100 similar burglaries at homes and offices of activists andjournalists around the country and abroad.   In all three break-ins, Wood said, a crowbar or other flatinstrument was used to pry open a door, ``papers were shuffledaround'' and nothing of value was stolen.   Wood said he suspected the FBI was involved, but Ray McElhaney,an FBI spokesman in Washington, said, ``I don't think there havebeen any break-ins involving the FBI. ... I have no statementregarding the allegations of this person in Montpelier, Vermont.''   ``We're now monitoring more than 120 break-ins around thecountry of this type,'' said Alicia Fernandez of the MovementSupport Network, which is affiliated with the Center forConstitutional Rights.   She said that the motives for the break-ins _ in which nothingwas stolen but files were rifled _ appeared to intelligencegathering, harassment and intimidation.   McElhaney said the FBI had launched its own investigation intoallegations of politically motivated break-ins but determined thatjurisdiction for the burglaries rested with state and local police.   Montpelier police officer Kenneth Roberts said he, too,initially thought the break-ins were politically motivated, butthat other recent break-ins with similar modes of operation hadsince led him to believe otherwise. He said it was unusual forbreak-ins to occur without anything being stolen, but that it hadhappened on at least two other instances in the city recently.   Wood's allegation came the same day The Boston Globe reportedthat confidential CBS News memos stolen from the home of a reporterbased in Costa Rica had turned up in files released by the FBI inresponse to a subpoena.   Free-lance reporter Tony Avirgan told the lobe that his home wasbroken into in 1985 and about a year later, during a time when hewas investigating on assignment from CBS an assassination attemptagainst a dissident Contra leader. Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif,chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee that oversees the FBI,said the documents indicate that the FBI ``could have been gettingthe fruits of political burglaries and break-ins.''   A spokesman for the FBI said the bureau had no comment on howthe reporter's documents ended up in its possession.</TEXT></DOC>
