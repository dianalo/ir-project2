(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Pittston Coal Group Inc. hasrejected an offer by the governor to mediate negotiations in anattempt to end the 2{-month-old United Mine Workers strike.   West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton issued the invitation Fridayto UMW President Richard Trumka and Paul Douglas, head of PittstonCoal Group's parent company, to mediate the strike talks.   The UMW accepted the offer within hours of Caperton's speech at aNational Coal Association meeting, but Douglas declined theinvitation Friday night, asking the governor instead to urge UMWleaders to halt the strike.   Douglas said Pittston could not accept a condition Caperton hadset for the talks at his mansion. The governor had asked coalcompanies to promise not to ship coal for Pittston while it isengaged in the negotiations.   ``Such interference with business relationships can play noconstructive role in any attempt to resolve the dispute, and is, infact, counterproductive,'' Douglas said.   Douglas also said collective bargaining mediated by the FederalMediation and Conciliation Service, from which the UMW withdrew June7, was the proper forum for resolving the strike.   Caperton set three other conditions for the talks _ that bothsides negotiate in good faith, that more than 44,000 miners in 10states end wildcat strikes and that legal action against the unionbe dropped.   ``The UMWA welcomes Gov. Caperton's offer to play a positive rolein ending this dispute,'' Trumka said. ``As I have repeatedly said,I am ready to go anywhere at any time to meet with Paul Douglas andhis management team to negotiate a mutually beneficial end to theunion's dispute with Pittston.''   About 1,900 UMW workers in Virginia and West Virginia went onstrike against Pittston on April 5 when the company imposed acontract after 14 months of fruitless negotiations. It requiresovertime and Sunday work and cuts medical benefits to retirees.   After a June 11 rally at the West Virginia Capitol, whichCaperton attended, wildcat strikes began spreading through coalcountry, idling 44,000 workers in 10 states.   The walkout continued mostly unabated Friday, despite severalcompanies winning back-to-work court orders against UMW memberswhose contracts forbid sympathy strikes.   U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp in Charleston postponed separatehearings for five companies who asked that the UMW and its membersbe held in contempt for ignoring back-to-work orders.   Union lawyer Chuck Donnelly said the judge suggested thepostponement because of the logistical problems of 18 separatehearings in one day and indicated he wanted to give the UMW andPittston time to consider Caperton's proposal.   A federal court in Virginia's Western District issued an orderFriday finding UMW members at Island Creek operations there incontempt for defying a back-to-work order. Any union member whoignores the court's order and fails to report to work beginningMonday will be fined $100 a day.   A federal judge in Indiana signed an order Friday directing UMWleaders to appear at a hearing next week to answer contempt chargesfor refusing an order to return to work.   Back-to-work orders also are being sought by companies in Alabamaand Pennsylvania, and Consolidation Coal Co. has said it plans toseek similar legal action in Illinois and Ohio.   About 100 miners returned to work in St. Clairsville, Ohio, andno new walkouts were reported Friday.   In Johnstown, Pa., roving pickets turned away about 600 UnitedSteelworkers members at a Bethlehem Steel Corp. plant that makesrailroad coal cars, the company said. Bethlehem Steel ownsBethEnergy Mines.   The estimated number of miners involved in unauthorized walkouts,according to union and industry officials, are: West Virginia16,000; Illinois, 8,500; Pennsylvania, 6,900; Alabama, 5,000; Ohio,2,560; Kentucky, 2,325; Indiana, 1,750; Virginia, 755; Missouri,350; and Tennessee, 200.</TEXT></DOC>
