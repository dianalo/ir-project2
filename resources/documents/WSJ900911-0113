Both commodities initially tumbled as traders digestednews from the Helsinki, Finland, summit. Although the SovietUnion at that meeting threw its support behind the U.S.stance against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, it failed topledge military support to the effort. Without that extramilitary might, a protracted stand-off seemed to traders tobe more likely than a war that might disrupt the flow of oilfrom the Middle East. As a result, war jitters evaporatedagain for the moment and along with them some of the warpremium buoying prices.</LP><TEXT>   Also putting early pressure on prices was an offer bySaddam Hussein to provide free oil to Third World countriesstarved for oil as a result of the Iraq-Kuwait embargo. Butthe offer was later discounted by traders who concluded thatfew nations would risk sending tankers to Iraq to pick up oilin violation of the embargo.   Then late in the trading day, after the close of the goldmarket, rumors of new Middle East troop movements caused oilprices to snap upward. Traders began buying oil contracts onunconfirmed reports that Iraqi soldiers might be massing onthe Jordanian border -- a move that they reasoned could bringIsrael into conflict with Iraq since Jordan is all thatseparates the two countries.   In Washington, a Pentagon official said the U.S. hasn'tseen any signs of threatening Iraqi troop movements nearJordan. The official said some Iraqi troops may have beenmoved during training exercises, though.   The price for crude for delivery during October jumped by$1.26 to $31.30 a barrel, climbing almost as much as it hadfallen during earlier trading. Heating oil and gasolineprices rose as well.   Volatility appeared to be the dominant trading feature,showing &quot;how precariously balanced the oil market is,&quot; saidLawrence Goldstein, president of Petroleum Industry ResearchFoundation.   Although the market focused mostly on Middle East action,product prices also received some support from remarks madeby Calvin Kent, head of the Energy Department's EnergyInformation Administration. He told a congressional hearingin Washington that gasoline stocks were only 5.9 millionbarrels above minimum operating inventory levels. If and whenthat level is reached, there could be shortages of gasoline,he told the lawmakers.   Because gold trading ended just as the most volatilerumors were surfacing, those prices missed most of the rallythat saw oil prices rebound.   Gold for December delivery ended with a loss of $11.20 anounce at $384.80, after swinging over a $10 range. Decembercontracts were under pressure from the start in reaction tothe Helsinki summit, but some demand for contracts developedbecause Saddam Hussein was scheduled to make a televisionspeech at 11:00 a.m. EDT. As a consequence, the Decembercontract rose to $391.60 an ounce, which was $4.40 belowFriday's close.   But according to analysts, there was none of thebelligerency they feared in the Iraqi leader's statement andDecember plunged to its low of the day of $381.60 an ounce.   Peter Cardillo, director of futures research for JesupJosephthal, New York, observed that the Helsinki conference,a strong dollar and weakness in platinum prices allcontributed to the price plunge in gold, which at its low wasshowing a loss of $14.40 an ounce.   The dollar rose against all foreign currencies except theyen. Prices of all platinum contracts plunged their dailypermissible limit of $25 an ounce and then recovered onlyslightly with the October contract settling at $457.50 anounce.   About 20 minutes before trading in precious metals ended,the oil rebound began, carrying gold with it. But goldtraders in the spot market apparently were unconvinced by theadvance in oil prices because gold in the noncontract marketdidn't continue to climb.   Oil traders and analysts predict that oil prices willlikely decline today unless the validity of rumors that droveyesterday's market is confirmed.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Grain futures prices rallied in heavytrading yesterday on a forecast of cold weather and rumors ofinternational events. &quot;These markets are just very nervousfor any kind of news,&quot; said Daniel Basse, director of marketresearch for AgResource Co., Chicago. &quot;This kind of pricemovement is unusual just before harvest.&quot; Traders continuedto speculate that the U.S. may offer an aid package to theSoviet Union for purchase of U.S. commodities, possiblyincluding wheat, soybean meal and corn. The prevailing rumorwas that President Bush may announce such a package when headdresses Congress tonight. Any such increase in demand forgrain is likely to push futures prices higher. Meanwhile, oneChicago weather forecaster's prediction of chilly weather anda possible frost this weekend in the upper Midwest alsoserved to drive prices higher. The soybean crop is stillvulnerable and poor weather could reduce yields, analystssaid.   A third factor exerting upward pressure on pricesyesterday was rumored movement of Iraqi troops along theJordanian border. Speculation that Iraq may invade Jordancaused crude oil prices to rise sharply. That raisedinflationary concerns for grains, the production of which isheavily dependent on petroleum products.   A report released after the close of trading yesterdayshowed a 6% reduction in the amount of soybeans in thecurrent crop thought to be in good condition, lendingcredibility to previous worries that hot weather in theMississippi Delta growing region might damage the crop there.The report may push futures prices higher today. In addition,an important U.S. Agriculture Department crop productionreport is due out after trading tomorrow. Analysts said thatreport would be very closely watched.                                                                                                          COTTON: Futures prices ended lower after fluctuatingwidely. The most active December contract settled at 72.06cents a pound, down 0.88 cent, after trading over a range of1.55 cents. The soonest-to-expire October contract was off1.08 cents to 72.58 cents, with a trading range of 1.40cents. Selling developed in early trading following a reportthat indicated yields of cotton being harvested in southernMississippi, a major cotton-growing state, were better thanexpected, an analyst said. The crop had experienced aprolonged drought during the growing season and there hadbeen concern about reduced production, he said. As pricesreached their day's lows, traders who had sold short beganbuying back contracts to offset their positions. That buyingtouched off a strong rally, which helped to partly recoverthe early losses, according to the analyst.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices declined. The most actively tradedDecember contract ended with a loss of 2.05 cents a pound at$1.2830. Some traders decided to take profits followingFriday's rally of more than seven cents a pound on concernover production problems in various areas of the world, ananalyst said. A comment in Paris by the Peruvian energy andmining minister that he expected the strike at Minero Perumine in Peru to end this week was also a price-depressingfactor, the analyst said. The Peruvian strike entered itsfourth week yesterday. A dealer noted that despite thesetback in futures, prices of the spot or soonest-to-expirecontracts on both the Commodity Exchange in New York and theLondon Metal Exchange widened to greater premiums over moredeferred contracts. This action, he said, reflected acontinuing tightness of supplies of copper for deliveryagainst futures on the exchanges.</TEXT></DOC>
