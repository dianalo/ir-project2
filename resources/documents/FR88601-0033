Since thattime, the Agency has reviewed numerous comments on the proposal and testimonyfrom the legislative hearings and the cross-examination proceedings. Asa result of this process EPA has updated the data base and analyses thatwill be used to support the final rule.On April 1, 1988, EPA placed the following documents in the public rulemakingdocket: the Asbestos Exposure Assessment, the Asbestos Modeling Study,the Nonoccupational Asbestos Exposure Report, and the Regulatory ImpactAnalysis (53 FR 10546). EPA allowed interested persons until May 31, 1988,to comment on these four documents, which were primarily updates of documentspreviously released for public comment in conjunction with the January29, 1986 proposed rule.On May 4, 1988, four additional documents were placed in the public docket:the Health Hazard Assessment of Non-Asbestos Fibers, the Review of RecentEpidemiological Investigations on Populations Exposed to Selected Non-AsbestosFibers, the Durable Fiber Exposure Assessment, and the Durable Fiber IndustryProfile and Market Outlook (53 FR 15857). These documents updated the factualinformation on fibers that are substitutes for asbestos. The Agency establishedJune 14, 1988 as the deadline for public comment on these four latter documents.EPA has received several requests for an extension of the comment periodon the grounds that, among other reasons, the time period for comment wasinsufficient in light of the amount of information in these documents.The Agency believes the time allowed for comment is adequate and reasonablein view of the nature of these records, but in the interest of receivinginformed comment, EPA has decided to extend the comment period to June30, 1988 on all documents related to the asbestos ban and phase out rulewhich were recently placed in the public docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 763</ITAG>Environmental protection, Hazardous substances, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Asbestos.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 26, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Charles L.
