<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-06-1060 </DOCNO><TEXT>In recent years, there has been a rapid growth in the number of wind turbinesconnected to the Danish electricity supply system. As of January 1987,the total number was 1197 with an aggregate output capacity of 73 MW.In 1986, the total electricity generation was about 120 GWh. As a by-productof this technological achievement, a valuable amount of experience hasbeen gained and insight provided into many actual and potential problemsof connecting wind turbines to the Danish grid system. The presentionwill include an overall description of the Danish electricity systemand an overview of the technical and economic key figures. Then the technicalgrid interface problems are reviewed, together with the present accountingrules for sales of privately wind generated electricity to the localelectric utilities. Finally, the overall effect on the electric systemat increasing levels of wind power penetration is described.</TEXT></DOC>
