This hasstimulated the growth of high current density solid state batteries withprolonged life for specialised application. The paper describes the recentinvestigations on the electrical conduction in two phase systems withparticular reference to AgI and CaF/sub 2/ based composites and offersexperimental evidence for the presence of high density of point defectsin the interfacial regions. The enhancement of conduction due to thepresence of a second phase is considered to be due to the contributionof these defects to the total conduction.</TEXT></DOC>
