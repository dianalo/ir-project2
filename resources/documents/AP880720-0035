(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jessica Hahn should return the $150,000trust fund she received from the PTL ministry in exchange for hersilence over her sexual encounter with former PTL President JimBakker, a federal bankruptcy judge ruled Tuesday.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds entered the judgmentTuesday against Ms. Hahn and a Los Angeles lawyer who administeredthe trust fund, Scott Furstman.   PTL had sued the two in April, claiming that Ms. Hahn broke heragreement with PTL by talking about her December 1980 meeting withBakker at a hotel in Clearwater Beach, Fla.   Last year, after the PTL scandal broke and Bakker resigned, Ms.Hahn sold her story _ illustrated with semi-nude photos _ toPlayboy magazine for a reported $1 million.   Ms. Hahn, who recently moved out of the Playboy Mansion in LosAngeles and now lives in a hotel there, never replied to the suit.She and Paul Roper, her representative in the 1985 transaction,have said they did not realize the money was PTL's, rather thanBakker's personal money.   Furstman, a lawyer PTL hired in 1985 to help in dealings withMs. Hahn, had responded that he would not contest PTL's claim.   Under the judge's order, PTL will receive $160,000 _ includingprincipal and accrued interest _ from a $150,000 trust fund it setup for Ms. Hahn in February 1985. Furstman will return $39,000 of aretainer PTL paid him to administer the trust fund.   After Bakker resigned in March 1987, it was revealed that Bakkerand his wife, Tammy, had received millions of dollars in salariesand bonuses from PTL. The TV ministry foundered as donationsdwindled, and PTL filed last year for bankruptcy reorganizationwith $130 million in debts.   The Hahn transaction, as well as other of Bakker's financialdealings at PTL, also are the object of a federal grand juryinvestigation in Charlotte into possible tax fraud.   An IRS report filed in bankruptcy court last December said PTL'spayments related to the Hahn incident included the $150,000 trustfund; a $115,000 payment given to Roper, who gave $20,000 to Ms.Hahn; $85,000 in legal fees to Furstman; and $10,000 paid to Ms.Hahn in 1984 for her signature on a statement absolving Bakker ofwrongdoing.   Under the agreement with Ms. Hahn, she was to receive monthlyinterest from the trust fund for 20 years, after which time shewould receive the $150,000 principal.   She did receive interest payments from May 1985 until PTLstopped the payments in March 1987. Her tax returns indicate shereceived $10,000 in 1985. She doesn't have to repay that money.</TEXT></DOC>
