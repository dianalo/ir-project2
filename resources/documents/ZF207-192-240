''The speedis really good,'' he said.andM;To date, Sun, which sells primarily to scientific and engineering markets,has relied on its 386i workstation to satisfy commercial markets.andP;  TheSPARCstation 1, based on Sun's proprietary Scalable Processor Architecture(SPARC), now joins the 386i in that market.andP;  A ''486i'' is expected to beintroduced later this year.andM;DOS-emulation software from Phoenix Technologies Ltd. of Norwood, Mass.,andO;makes it possible for Sun's Unix machines, including the SPARCstation, to runMS-DOS applications.andM;Software vendors, including Autodesk Inc., WordPerfect Corp. and FrameTechnology Corp., have ported existing programs to the SPARCstation and thelatest version of its Unix operating system, SunOS 4.0, which runs on alleight machines.andM;Lotus Development Corp. will move its 1-2-3 spreadsheet to the SPARCstation,but no date has been set, according to company officials.andM;In addition to the SPARCstation 1, Sun's new products are:andM;the five-slot pedestal SPARCstation 330 and the 12-slot pedestal 370, both16-mips workstations for ''power'' Unix users, priced from $30,000 and$41,000, respectively.andP;  They run full-motion video and sound.andM;SPARCserver 330, 370 and 390 network servers, which are priced at $29,000,$62,000 and $72,000, respectively, based on memory and storage capacity.andM;the Desktop Sun 3/80 (a 3-mips machine) and the ''deskside'' Sun 3/400 familyof 7-mips computers, starting at $6,000 and $41,000, respectively.andM;the GX and GXP graphics boards, offering 24-bit color and acceleratedgraphics.andP;  They will not be sold separately.andP;  The addition of GX and GXPgraphics boards adds anywhere from $8,000 to $10,000 to the price of asystem.andP;  The boards are now available for all machines.andM;----------Additional reporting by Evan O.
