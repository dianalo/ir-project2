A mathematicalmodel has been developed for the drilling action of a tricone bit whichgives quantitative predictions for torque, given the bit geometry andthe force-penetration relationships for the individual indentors. Theresults of the model are substantiated by a number of laboratory experimentsconducted on a fully instrumented bit. Using this device the detailsof the indentor motion can be analysed and the forces acting on certainof the indentors can be obtained while drilling. The detailed mathematicalmodel can be simplified to a field interpretation model in which thetorque response is described in terms of a contribution from the gougingaction of the bit teeth and a contribution associated with the indentingaction of the teeth. The relative magnitude of these two contributionsdepends on the lithology being drilled and the wear state of the bit.The interpretation model has been verified through extensive use in thefield, examples of which are documented elsewhere.</TEXT></DOC>
