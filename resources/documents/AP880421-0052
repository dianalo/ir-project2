On Wednesday, it achieved another success, negotiating apeaceful end to the hijacking of a Kuwait Airways jetliner.   Neither Algeria nor Kuwait provided any details of the deal thatended the hijacking, setting free the 31 remaining hostages.   But some evidence indicates the outlines of the deal thatKuwait's official news agency said assured the nine hijackers safepassage to Tehran or Beirut may have been worked out in Cyprus morethan a week ago.   Interior Minister Hedi Khediri, asked about the fate of thehijackers, replied, ``That is strictly Algeria's affair.''   The hijackers had demanded that Kuwait release 17 pro-Iranianterrorists jailed for the 1983 bombings of U.S. and Frenchembassies in Kuwait. Kuwait steadfastly refused.   Algeria was criticized for striking deals in the 1970s. Theworld media dubbed the nation a ``sanctuary for hijackers,'' andfor a while it adopted a policy of not accepting hijacked planes.   But in 1981, the North African nation gained prestige formediating the release of the American hostages held in the U.S.Embassy in Iran.   Algeria also was involved in negotiations that led to the end ofthe 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner with 145 people aboard. Thehijackers had killed a U.S. Navy diver.   The non-aligned nation is a strong believer in secretnegotiations and in mediations it adheres to another country'swishes to the letter.   Khediri declined to disclose any details of the bargaining inthe Kuwaiti hijacking, which began April 5 on a flight from Bangkokto Kuwait.   Before the plane landed in Algiers from Larnaca on April 13,Cypriot officials told reporters it was allowed to take off onlybecause Algeria had given formal assurance all the hostages wouldbe released.   The hijackers had killed two passengers in Larnaca.   Algeria promptly denied the claim, apparently to avoid arousingthe suspicion of the hijackers in delicate maneuvering at Algiersairport.   Aided by the revolutionary credentials it gained in its bittereight-year war of independence with France, Algeria is well placedamong Moslem countries in mediating between moderate governmentsand fundamentalist Islamic extremists.   In this case, it set up a top-level negotiating committee,personally supervised by Khediri and divided into two teams, onefor contacts with the Kuwaitis and the other for liaison with thegunmen.   Algerian officials shuttled seemingly unperturbed between thetwo sides.   Khediri himself was the first Algerian to board the plane onApril 13. After talking to the hijackers for 30 minutes, heannounced they had promised to ``refrain from all violence while onAlgerian territory.''   Various Algerian negotiators went to and from the plane day andnight for six days. Several times, hooded hijackers climbed downfrom the plane to talk to Algerian negotiators in a Soviet-built,yellow, Niva hatchback car.   When the hijackers had something new to say, they would call onthe jet's radio, ``Yellow car, please.''   When the Algerians wanted to talk to the hijackers or send thema message, they would ask, ``Can the yellow car come to the plane,please?''   Extreme politeness was observed in all these exchanges. Therewas never any discussion of substantive issues since conversationswith the control tower were monitored by reporters. The yellow carwas the negotiating vehicle.   When the hostages finally emerged from the plane at 6 a.m.Wednesday, the hijackers were gone.</TEXT></DOC>
