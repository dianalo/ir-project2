But when workers wouldn't join, organizers renamed themselves the Workers' Marxist-Leninist Party. Even with the new name, party leader Sandor Petres expects tough going. He admitted to Hungarian Radio that he couldn't name a single effective working communist country anywhere in the world, but obviously he and his colleagues intend to fight to the bitter end, even if it is no longer feasible to use that C-word. </TEXT></DOC>
