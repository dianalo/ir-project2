It consists of three exons of which thefirst, approximately 560 nucleotides in length, is noncoding althoughevolutionarily conserved. The c-myc gene product is translated from exons2 and 3. The transcripts have a size of 2.4 and 2.2 kb that are synthesizedunder the direction of two promoters, P1 and P2, respectively. Normalc-myc RNAs and their 62-64 kDa polypeptide products are highly unstablein vivo. The c-myc protein has been localized within the nucleus andhas been proposed to contribute to a cell's competence to enter and progressthrough the cell cycle.</TEXT></DOC>
