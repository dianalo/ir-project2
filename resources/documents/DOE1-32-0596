In addition, the &quot;missrate&quot; associated with the radiographic detection of lung nodules is approximately30%. A computerized scheme that alerts the radiologist to possible locationsof lung nodules should allow this number of false-negative diagnosesto be reduced. The authors are developing a computer-aided nodule detectionscheme based on a difference image approach. They attempt to eliminatethe camouflaging background structure of the normal lung anatomy by creating,from a single-projection chest image, two images: one in which the signal-to-noiseratio (SNR) of the nodule is maximized and another in which that SNRis suppressed while the processed background remains essentially thesame. Thus, the difference between these two processed images shouldconsist of the nodule superimposed on a relatively uniform backgroundin which the detection task may be simplified. This difference imageapproach is fundamentally different from conventional subtraction techniques(e.g., temporal or dual-energy subtraction) in that the two images whichare subtracted arise from the same single-projection chest radiograph.Once the difference image is obtained, thresholding is performed alongwith tests for circularity, size and growth in order to extract the nodules.It should be noted that once an original chest image is input to thecomputer the nodule detection process is totally automated.</TEXT></DOC>
