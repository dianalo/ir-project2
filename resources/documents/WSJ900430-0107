Mr. Rose, formerly senior vicepresident for marketing in the motion-picture division, wasindicted on one count of filing a false 1984 tax return.   The indictment accuses the men of receiving kickbacks ofmoney, goods and services from various companies doingbusiness with Paramount. The kickbacks allegedly includedfree use of a summer home on Fire Island in New York for Mr.Weaver and the purchase of a MercedesBenz for Mr. Rose.   The indictment says that the two men failed to report thekickbacks as income on their tax returns. Avraham Moskowitze,the assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting the case, declined todisclose the total value of the alleged kickbacks.   The indictment also alleges that between 1978 and 1984 Mr.Weaver extorted kickbacks from companies doing business withParamount by threatening that Paramount would withhold itsbusiness if the kickbacks weren't made.   In a statement, Mr. Weaver, who now runs his own marketingcompany, Gordon Weaver Enterprises, said the allegations were&quot;unsupported&quot; and &quot;utterly lacking in credibility.&quot; Hisattorney, Robert Fink, said, &quot;These allegations are six yearsold. . . . As the statute of limitations on these charges wasabout to run out, there was a rush to indict.&quot;   Gerald Walpin, an attorney for Mr. Rose, said, &quot;When allthe facts come out, this won't be considered anywhere near amajor charge against Mr. Rose.&quot; He declined to comment whenasked whether Mr. Rose denied the allegations.   A spokeswoman for Paramount declined to comment.   According to the indictment, Mr. Weaver and Mr. Rosereceived the kickbacks from Spiros Associates and FilmlandProduction, two New York companies that did business withParamount. The indictment says that Mr. Rose asked Filmlandto provide him with the Mercedes-Benz in April 1983. He alsois accused of receiving about $2,260 from Filmland inNovember 1983 to pay for a party for his daughter.   The two men are to be arraigned in federal court inManhattan Thursday. If convicted, Mr. Weaver would face amaximum fine of $700,000 and a prison sentence of up to 17years. Mr. Rose would face a maximum fine of $100,000 and asentence of up to three years.</TEXT></DOC>
