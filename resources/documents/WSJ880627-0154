Greenberger (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LATAM </CO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Following up his fruitless travels promoting Arab-Israeli peace, Secretary of State George Shultz is off this week to Central America on yet another futile mission: to reassure allies of Washington's interest and commitment in the region when both actually are wanning.    Mr. Shultz's trip to El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica may be designed to show that even in the final months of the Reagan administration, the secretary remains deeply engaged in the region. In reality, the secretary has few cards to play. He is taking the trip mostly because it was urged on him by congressional Republicans &quot;to counter a certain feeling that the administration is turning away from Central America,&quot; says a senior administration official.    Peace talks between the Nicaraguan Sandinistas and the U.S.-backed Contras are deadlocked, and Congress, in an election year, isn't interested in revisiting the contentious issue of Contra aid. At the same time, fragile civilian governments in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, once heralded as showcases of President Reagan's foreign policy, suffer from economic ills or the mounting threat of military coups, and the administration appears incapable of dealing with either.    Moreover, senior U.S. officials worry that the failed effort to oust Gen. Manuel Noriega, Panama's dictator, showed the region that coup-plotters have little to fear from the U.S. And Mr. Shultz will have difficulty making the case that the administration is interested in nurturing democracy now that Congress has slashed U.S. economic assistance to the four nations he will visit by nearly 25% this year.    &quot;Up until now, a lot of U.S. influence over the region has come from the belief that the U.S. could or would ultimately use military force,&quot; says Susan Kaufman Purcell, director of the Latin America Project at the Council on Foreign Relations, a private organization that studies foreign policy issues. &quot;Now, if the stick has disappeared, it hasn't been replaced by a credible carrot. It isn't clear why forces in these countries that oppose U.S. policy should pay attention.&quot;    One reason Mr. Shultz's mission is unlikely to produce any lasting results is that he isn't planning to visit the one country in the region that he says is the source of Central America's problems, Nicaragua. Senior officials say they don't expect a surprise trip to Managua similar to the presidential-election-year visit Mr. Shultz made in 1984.    Ironically, the absence of such a meeting will hurt the administration's chances of winning support for more Contra aid from so-called swing voters among moderate congressional Democrats. The White House is expected to submit to the lawmakers soon a proposal for more aid for the rebels. At times in the past, the swing voters have held the balance of power on the issue.    &quot;It's unbelievable to me that we'll talk to (Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev about arms control but adamantly refuse to negotiate with a neighboring country about the removal of foreign military advisers only several hours' flight-time from our border,&quot; says Rep. James Slattery, a moderate Democrat from Kansas.    Elsewhere in the region, political problems are brewing anew. In Guatemala, the two-year-old elected government of President Vinicio Cerezo put down a military coup last month, but ultraconservatives continue to criticize the government relentlessly. Hostility to the U.S. is building in Honduras, which fears it will be left hosting 10,000 armed Contras who ultimately will be abandoned by Washington. In El Salvador, the government of ailing President Jose Napoleon Duarte is mired in corruption and faces a strong electoral challenge from the far right party that has had links to death squads.    If all this wasn't bad enough, Mr. Shultz's task suffers further because he goes to the region with little popular backing in the U.S. for Central America. After almost eight years, Ronald Reagan, the most popular president in a half-century, hasn't succeeded in interesting the U.S. in the region's problems.    The Sandinistas will outlast Mr. Reagan. And with the right-wing forces that ceded power to democratic governments in the early Reagan years stirring again, the U.S. appears headed toward another of its periodic bouts of indifference toward its southern neighbors. That may end only when the next left-wing revolution rears its head. </TEXT></DOC>
