Foreign Ministry spokesman Eugenio Castro said in a telephoneinterview the meeting will be held Monday and Tuesday. He refused togive further details.   Officials in Washington could not be reached immediately forcomment.   In February, the presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala,Honduras and Costa Rica agreed to the peace proposal, which includesfreeing hundreds of former Nicaraguan national guardsmen and freeand open elections in that country.   As part of the agreement, the leaders said they would draft aplan by May 15 to disband the 11,000-member rebel force fightingNicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.   Most of the rebels, known as Contras, fled to border bases inHonduras after U.S. military assistance ended last year.   The Sandinistas and the Contras signed a provisional truce inMarch 1988.   Castro said two senior diplomats and two army colonels willrepresent the Honduran government at the Washington talks. He saidContra leaders Adolfo Calero, Aristides Sanchez, Roberto Ferrey andEnrique Bermudez will represent the rebels.   Honduras has reluctantly tolerated Contras in its territory since1981, when the rebels _ with U.S. assistance _ started battling theSandinistas.   The presence of rebel supply and training bases along the borderwith Nicaragua has soured relations between the two countries, andthere have been frequent clashes between soldiers from the two sides.   On Saturday, the Nicaraguan Defense Ministry accused Hondurantroops of attacking the Nicaraguan border post of Murupuchi, 110miles north of Managua, the Nicaraguan capital. It said the post wasattacked 13 times in February and this was the sixth in March.   A Defense Ministry news release in Managua said Honduran troopsopened fire on the post with automatic weapons and mortars but didnot say when the attack took place or give other details.   There was no immediate public response from the Hondurangovernment.   As part of the peace initiative, the Sandinista government saidFriday it will free this month 1,984 former members of oustedPresident Anastasio Somoza's national guard.   Nicaraguan security chief Lenin Cerna said the guardsmen will befreed after the National Assembly formally approves a pardon requestfrom President Daniel Ortega.   Cerna said the guadsmen, who were jailed after the Sandinistasoverthrew Somoza in a 1979 revolution, will be free to leave thecountry.</TEXT></DOC>
