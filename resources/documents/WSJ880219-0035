The year-earlier quarter's net loss was $197.5 million for the parent of Pan American World Airways, which also posted a narrower net loss for all of 1987.    Separately, the 4,800-member Transport Workers Union said it wouldn't support a Teamsters-led strike against the airline. The pilots, flight attendants and flight engineers, which recently have agreed to labor concessions, already have indicated that their members aren't likely to support such a strike. The Teamsters, representing 4,300 reservationists, ticket agents and other workers, have threatened to strike after a cooling-off period that ends at midnight EST Saturday. The TWU and Teamsters still are in contract talks with the carrier.    If a strike is called, Pan Am has said that it has trained replacements for the Teamsters and intends to continue to operate a full schedule of flights.    Also, Pan Am said that at the end of the fourth quarter, it had about $250 million in cash on hand. While Pan Am is in the midst of the slow winter season, Julius Maldutis, analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc., said he doesn't see &quot;any severe liquidity pressures on Pan Am at this point. But a protracted strike by any one labor group could undoubtedly hurt Pan Am.&quot;    Results in the latest quarter reflected unexpected increases in expenses, Pan Am said, including a rise in fuel costs to $148 million from $100 million; $34.6 million in foreign-exchange losses primarily related to yen-denominated debt; $42 million for increased allowances for inventory obsolescence, uncollectable receivables and costs associated with its frequent-flier program; and an $18 million provision to settle an age-discrimination suit, to be paid over the next three years.    Fourth-quarter revenue rose 9.8% to $877.1 million from $798.6 million. For all of 1987, Pan Am's net loss narrowed to $265.3 million from $462.8 million; analysts and sources close to the company had predicted a 1987 loss of about $150 million. Revenue climbed 18% to $3.59 billion.    &quot;A loss of this magnitude underscores the urgent need for Pan Am to lower its current operating costs and revitalize its marketing and revenue generating programs,&quot; said Thomas G. Plaskett, who last month was named chairman and chief executive officer.    Pan Am said that fourth-quarter expenses also included adjustments affecting commission expense, outside maintenance services and vacation accruals. A Pan Am spokesman added that these adjustments reflect Pan Am's actual expenses better than previous estimates.    Andrew B. Kim, analyst for F. Eberstadt Fleming, called the write-offs and adjustments &quot;a new president's syndrome. . . You're supposed to do this to get the books in shape.&quot; He said that the &quot;real damage&quot; in the fourth period was the $34.6 million foreign-exchange losses compared with a $1.7 million gain in the 1986 period.    Pan Am's failure to cut labor costs during 1987 also depressed results. For the year, Pan Am said, labor expense rose 9.4% to $1.09 billion.    Mr. Kim said: &quot;If you look at the numbers. . .Pan Am's labor costs went up 12% in the fourth quarter year over year and TWA's (labor costs) declined by 3%. That is the issue that Plaskett has to deal with to get the labor costs down.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
