It is urgent,'' he said.   Outgoing Premier Jacques Chirac thanked Iran for its help infreeing the French hostages. He said the Islamic Republic hadintervened to get them out of Lebanon and announced that diplomaticrelations between France and Iran, broken last July, may bereestablished.   Nine Americans and three Britons are among the 18 foreignersstill held captive by pro-Iranian Shiite extremists in Lebanon. TheU.S. and British governments have said they will not negotiate withterrorists.   Kauffmann spoke to 250 reporters, a former American hostage andrelatives of hostages at a packed news conference in a Left Banktheater.   ``There was a consensus among the French that they wanted tofree their hostages, and they supported what their government didto get us out,'' he said.   Kauffmann, 44, and diplomats Marcel Carton, 64, and MarcelFontaine, 45, were freed May 4 in Beirut. They had been held by thepro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group Islamic Jihad for three years.   Interior Minister Charles Pasqua oversaw negotiations that ledto their release. A fourth French hostage, Michel Seurat, died incaptivity.   Kauffmann said he believed all nine of the American hostages andthe three British hostages were still alive.   He was flanked by his wife, Joelle, and the head of thecommittee of journalists who pressured the government for hisrelease. Kauffmann writes for the weekly news magazine L'Evenementdu Jeudi.   Kauffman refused to discuss the status of the foreign hostages.He said that doing so could put them in danger or cause them tolose the small privileges that make life bearable: the few booksand cigarettes they are sometimes allowed.   Former American hostage David Jacobsen sat in the front rowbeside Jill Morrell, fiance of British television journalist JohnMcCarthy, 31, kidnapped April 17, 1986.   Peggy Say, sister of American journalist Terry Anderson, thelongest-held hostage, spoke to Kauffmann and the other two Frenchhostages. Fontaine shared a cell with Anderson for several months.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was seized in west Beirut March 16, 1985.   ``I have never tried to tell my government exactly what to do,''said Mrs. Say. ``But I think that after more than three years, theycould, perhaps, take some pointers from the French and follow theleads and initiatives the French government has provided.''   Mrs. Say met earlier in the day with Pasqua.   During the two years that Pasqua and the government of Chiracwere in office, 10 French hostages were freed in Lebanon. No Frenchhostages are believed to remain in the hands of the kidnappers.   Asked what the American government was doing to secure herbrother's release, Mrs. Say replied, ``I'm not exactly sure,because they don't share that with me.''   ``All they tell me is that there continues to be quietdiplomacy, although I'm not sure what that means. After all thistime, I have to wonder if quiet diplomay is a code word for nodiplomacy.''   She said that after her meetings with the three former Frenchhostages she was reassured about her brother's physical condition.``Terry's Marine Corps training is standing him in good stead. Heis surviving.''   But, she said, it was also clear that he was angry.   ``He feels betrayed by his own government and by the people hewas in Lebanon to serve. I'm sure that when he gets out _ and Ibelieve he will _ it will take a long time from him to recover fromthis.''   Before the news conference, Joelle Kauffmann said her husbandwould be checking back into Val-de-Grace military hospital torecover from exhaustion. The three hostages spent 48 hours in thehospital for physical examinations after they arrived in Francelast Thursday.   Kauffmann said fellow hostage Michel Seurat became ill inSeptember 1985 with what Kauffmann believes was cancer. On Dec. 28,Seurat said goodbye to Kauffmann and was taken to another, cellwhere he died.</TEXT></DOC>
