In a republic, the citizens are the ruling class. They are the permanent and the principal rulers. All other offices that are set up by the constitution are secondary.&quot;    That affirmation of each citizen's political responsibility, which ranges from awareness to voting, is true, realized by too few nowadays, acted upon by even fewer, and thus is in grave danger of lapsing into an abstract idea. It is stated in Mortimer J. Adler's admirably compressed book, &quot;We Hold These Truths: Understanding the Ideas and Ideals of the Constitution&quot; (Macmillan, 288 pages, $16.95). In addition to its concise exposition, more than a third is occupied by the full texts of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States of America and annotated excerpts from historical documents -- statements from the Constitutional Convention of 1787, items from &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; and from anti-Federalist writings.    Also included is Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, which Mr. Adler justly calls, in its terse reaffirmation, the third part of &quot;our American testament.&quot;    In 1976 we celebrated the bicentennial of our Declaration of Independence with a blend of due solemnity and hype. This summer we will observe the 200th anniversary of the Constitutional Convention that drafted the document under which our government functions.    Mr. Adler clarifies some minor confusions about these national anniversaries. The Declaration of 1776 used the phrase, &quot;the United States of America,&quot; but that political entity did not yet exist except as a gleam in the eyes of the signers. The later Articles of Confederation did not &quot;constitute&quot; a new nation, hence the convention of 1787. Ratification of the proposed Constitution by the required two-thirds of the 13 states did not occur until 1788. George Washington did not take office as the first president of that new nation until 1789, before which, it can be argued, it had not existed fully and formally. It is more accurate to say of all these occasions that we have come 200 years from the crucial two decades of our emerging national existence, the 1770s and 1780s.    Lincoln's Gettysburg Address reasserts the life of that &quot;more perfect union&quot; for which the Constitutional Convention has striven. Yet present or future carelessness, irresponsibility, or stark ignorance of the very core of our federal union still could result in the slow death of its great ideas. That is why Justice Harry Blackmun, of the U.S. Supreme Court, says in a Foreword: &quot;The Constitution is what we live by in this nation. Too many of us know too little about it.&quot;    Former Chief Justice Warren Burger will be coordinator of public observances of the Constitution this summer. Some programs on public television will be linked to Mortimer Adler's book. &quot;We Hold These Truths&quot; is the most succinct, accessible publication about the Constitution for those concerned -- which should include everybody, but won't -- about the meaning of American political freedom.    There is no total freedom. Anarchy, which theoretically would be such, is an oppression in which all civic protections vanish. Mr. Adler emphasizes &quot;rightful authority,&quot; tracing that concept back through Aristotle to such ancient codifiers of civil law as Solon. He pursues the progression from domestic government (the family) to that of the city -- the Greek &quot;polis,&quot; from which we derive &quot;politics.&quot; The city expands to all forms of larger states. &quot;Rightful authority&quot; is a difficult thing to attain or maintain. In our own pursuit of it, &quot;The American Constitution created the first federal republic in the history of the world.&quot;    Like all human designs it was not perfect. Mr. Adler traces the history of its 26 amendments, emphasizing especially the first 10, our Bill of Rights. The Constitution remains imperfect and must ever be so, though it is the best so far in history. Mr. Adler's final chapter, &quot;What Remains to Be Done?&quot; inevitably is so debatable that he casts it as a series of questions, not answers. Notable also are his three reasons for opposing the idea of a new constitutional convention. One is the current distorting trend toward single-issue politics. Related to that: The original convention's work was conducted in secrecy, even though the subsequent long debate over ratification was properly public. Such procedural secrecy would be impossible today though it had much to recommend it in the original working process.    Some will be offended by Mr. Adler's third reservation, though I believe he is right. Compared with 1787, &quot;the much larger number of citizens in our present population are not nearly as well educated. Their minds are not as well cultivated and their characters not as well formed.&quot; Even if a good revised draft constitution were presented for ratification, &quot;our present citizenry . . . would not have the kind of schooling that enabled them to understand its provisions and to appraise their worth. The vast majority would not even be able to read intelligently and critically the kind of arguments . . . published in current periodicals in the years 1787 and 1788.&quot;    Reading this important little book will help one understand why &quot;a radical reform of basic schooling in the U.S. . . . is an indispensable prerequisite for making the degree of democracy we have so far achieved prosper, work better, or, perhaps, even survive.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
