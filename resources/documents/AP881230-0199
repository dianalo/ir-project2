Avery bought Uniroyal Chemical for more than $700 million fromUniroyal Inc. in 1986 in hopes of creating a large, multinationalchemical company, Jerry Hostetter, an Avery spokesman, said Thursday.   However, Avery abandoned the idea early this year after it foundthat the plan was too expensive to carry out, he said.   Avery said in a statement late Thursday that the investor group,which also includes Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., would pay $240million to $250 million in cash for Uniroyal Chemical as well as theassumption of the division's $560 million in debt.   Avery said that if it reached agreement with the group, the dealwould require the approval of its board, shareholders andbondholders, and would also require financing commitments. Drexelwould arrange for the financing, Avery said.   Avery also announced plans earlier this year to dispose of itscoal subsidiary. Without the chemical and coal divisions, ``inessence, it would only be an investment company,'' Hostetter said.   He said Avery, with $45 million to $55 million in cash, wouldconsider other acquisitions or the possible liquidation of the firm.   Avery's stock closed at $3.18} in over-the-counter tradingThursday, up 6\ cents from Wednesday.   Uniroyal Inc. sold off the chemical division along with its otherassets after the company _ at one point one of the world's leadingrubber producers _ went private in a leveraged buyout.   Uniroyal Chemical had 1988 sales of $734.2 million, up from$590.5 million last year, Avery said.</TEXT></DOC>
