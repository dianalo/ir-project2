 It was scheduled, disastrously, immediately following atypically leaden dormitory lunch, making it more often than not an occasionfor blissful slumber.andP;  One interruption to this thrice-weekly doze apparentlyoccurred during a discussion of William James' illustration of the principleof pragmatism.andP;  James had provided his readers with the homey example of aman attempting to get a good look at a squirrel as it climbs a tree trunk.andO;I'm still not certain I fully grasped James' conception of pragmatism, but Icertainly took to his illustration.andM;Squirrels, as most of us have observed, hate to be watched while they'rescurrying up a tree trunk, and have cleverly figured out that an effectiveway to prevent observation is to put the trunk between themselves and theobserver.andP;  Not willing to be thwarted in this manner, James' resolute humanattempts to follow the spunky rodent by circling the tree, but to noavail--the creature continues to move so as to keep the trunk between itsefland the bothersome intruder.andM;James intended this tale to spotlight the total irrelevance of any semanticrumination over whether the man could be said to have gone round thesquirrel.andP;  While I'm not unappreciative of James' point, I like his littlevignette because it seems to illustrate an important aspect of intellectualproperty law that's easy to lose sight of.andM;To a passerby observing the scene, the positions of man and squirrel wouldappear to be constantly changing.andP;  One moment the human is on the north sideof the trunk, and the animal on the south, while seconds later theirpositions are reversed.andP;  But a common thread connects the actions of man andbeast, regardless of their positions at any given time with respect to thetree: their respective interests, which at all times remain the same, arefundamentally opposed to one another.andP;  The man is determined to get to lookat the squirrel, while the animal is equally determined to elude his view.andO;No matter how their positions change relative to the tree, the man wantssomething the squirrel won't let him have, and this opposition defines therelationship between the two.andM;A squirrel guarding its visage isn't all that different from an individual orcompany trying to protect what it considers its valuable intangibleattributes.andP;  In column past we've often discussed various aspects of what areusually considered the three most basic legal concepts for protection ofintangible--or, as its generally termed, intellectual--property: copyright,patent, and trade secret.andP;  Recently we focused on a group of intellectualproperty concepts that is in a sense illustrated by the man-and-squirrelpredicament; these include trade and service marks, trade names, and arelated group of concepts we will now examine.andM;The concepts discussed thus far as part of this current series of columns(see &quot;Rules of the Game&quot;, Vol.andP;  8, Nos.andP;  1 and 2, as well) greatly differfrom our familiar copyright, patent, or trade secret.andP;  The laws regardingeach of those &quot;basic&quot; concepts operate to prevent a person from appropriatingyour intellectual property and presenting it as his or her own.andP;  By contrast,the more obscure group of legal concepts we will consider here operate toprevent someone from palming off his or her product or service as yours,thereby cashing in on your right to be the only commercial exploiter of suchintangibles as your good name and reputation.andP;  To refer once again to ourexample--by shifting to this aspect of intellectual property protection, youand your adversary have in effect circled around to opposite sides of thetree.andM;When litigants make this change in position, the rules also changefrequently, but just as with the man and the squirrel, the fundamentalconflict between the parties involved remains the same.andP;  In the legalcontext, conflict arises because one of the parties perceives him- or herselfas possessing a vested intangible property right that the other does not wishto recognize.andP;  Whether the battleground is tradesecret law or trademark law,it's still right to property versus the right to make use of concepts andideas freely--a conflict that is unlikely ever to be completely resolved inthe US.andM;The issues at stake usually become clouded as we move away from the three&quot;basic&quot; intellectual property concepts of copyright, patent, and trade secretbecause at first glance other concepts in this category don't seem to bearmuch relation to one another--or even to intellectual property.andP;  Thisconfusion stems from the fact that &quot;intellectual property&quot; is an amorphousconcept; indeed, it may be simplest first to define it by what it's not.andO;Obviously it's not tangible property, like a plot of land.andP;  Having said that,though, the matter becomes more complicated, since intellectual property mayreside in tangible objects, like a book or a computer chip.andP;  Consider apromissory note, which, like paper money, has value not for the paper and inkthat constitute its tangible aspect, but by virtue of the symbolic value weassign it.andP;  Yet neither notes nor currency are ordinarily considered toconstitute intellectual property.andP;  No, intellectual property is somethingmore elusive: an expression, a concept, a secret, &quot;good will&quot;--even, as we'llsee shortly, a style.andP;  In one way or another, the legal concepts we willaddress in this column concern the protection of this kind of property.andM;It's easy to see that a trademark used to distinguish a product from similarproducts marketed by competitors might constitute a valuable asset.andP;  But doesBette Midler's style of singing?andP;  Yes indeed.andP;  However, the legal pathwaythat leads to this conclusion is not easily traced.andM;In 1985, Midler was approached by Ford Motor Company's advertising agencyabout performing her 1973 song, &quot;Do You Wanna Dance&quot;, in a Mercury Sabletelevision commercial.andP;  When she declined on the basis of her longstandingpolicy not to promote commercial products, the agency hired Ula Hedwig, aformer backup singer for Midler, who performed what was termed &quot;a more thancredible imitation&quot; of Midler's rendition.andP;  Ms.andP;  Midler responded in 1987 byfiling a lawsuit against the agency and Ford that relied both on a Californiastatute prohibiting unauthorized use of another person's &quot;name, voice,signature, photograph or likeness&quot;, and on the application of generalCalifornia common law property rights.andM;The federal trial judge assigned the case was unable to find any legalprinciple in these California laws that would prevent imitation of Midler'svoice, and granted a summary judgment in favor of the defendants.andP;  The 9thCircuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled differently, though.andP;  Theappellate judges decided that under California law Midler has a common lawproperty right to the use of her &quot;persona&quot;, ruling thatandM;.  .  .when a distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known andis deliberately imitated in order to sell a product, the sellers haveappropriated what is not theirs....andM;Before reaching their conclusion that the lawsuit should proceed, the judgesfirst had to address the application of the First Amendment of the USConstitution.andP;  They ruled that a reproduction of a likeness or sound isprotected under the First Amendment if it is &quot;informative or cultural&quot;, butnot if it merely &quot;exploits&quot; the person portrayed.andP;  The judges also recognizedthat under the federal copyright laws, which exclusively govern liability forunauthorized reproduction of music, a voice cannot be copyrighted.andP;  Since theCalifornia statute prohibiting use of a person's voice doesn't precludeimitations of it, the appellate judges decided that Midler's common lawproperty right to her persona provided the only basis for the lawsuit.andM;This was basis enough, as it turned out.andP;  The suit returned to the trialcourt, where a jury awarded Midler $400,000 against the advertising agency.andO;(Ford had in the meantime been dismissed as a defendant.)andM;As we know, state laws are not uniform across the US, so it shouldn'tsurprise us that actor Woody Allen was unsuccessful when he attempted toinvoke New York laws that bear some similarity to California's laws inlawsuits he filed against Allen look-alike Phil Boroff.andP;  Boroff's likenesshad been appearing in magazine advertisements, accompanied by a disclaimer,set in fine type, stating that this was a celebrity look-alike.andM;Allen finally did obtain an injunction, however, not under New York laws butunder a provision of the federal Lanham Act--the same statute that providesfor federal registration of trademarks.andP;  This section of the federalenactment prohibits &quot;a false designation of origin, or any false descriptionor representation&quot; used &quot;in connection with any goods or services&quot;.andP;  Theinconspicuous disclaimer in the ads picturing Boroff, the New York courtruled, was insufficient to prevent people from getting the impression thatAllen was endorsing the defendant's products.andM;Woody Allen's ultimate triumph is grounded in a legal doctrine that's acommon element in our group of &quot;non-basic&quot; concepts that are used to protectintellectual property: the likelihood that the public may become confused.andO;Indeed, &quot;likelihood of confusion&quot; is a central theme of many trade-name andtrademark lawsuits, and it figures prominently in many of the legalcontroversies that fall within that grab-bag legal category, unfaircompetition.andM;Just ask Borden, Inc., which wanted to market its plastic yellow lemon-shapedcontainers of juice--ubiquitous in the US--in Britain.andP;  &quot;Nothing doing&quot; wasthe recent ruling from the House of Lords, which functions as Britain'sSupreme Court in such matters.andP;  It seems that Borden's RealLemon container isconsidered to bear a more than passing resemblance to that long used by a UKbrand, Jif, and, in the words of Lord Bridge of Harwich, &quot;Housewives buyingplastic lemons in supermarkets do not read the labels but assume thatwhatever they buy must be Jif.&quot;andM;Though Borden's partisans have expressed something akin to outrage, I reallydoubt that the result would have been different had equivalent proceedingstaken place in a US court, with Borden seeking to keep Jif out of theAmerican market.andP;  For as we have seen, the likelihood-of-confusion principleis a fixture of US law as well, and lies at the heart of many of ourintellectual property controversies.andP;  Developers and vendors of clonesoftware ought always to bear this in mind.andM;Glenn Groenewold is a California attorney who devotes his time to writing andlecturing on computer law.andP;  He also has served as an administrative lawjudge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
