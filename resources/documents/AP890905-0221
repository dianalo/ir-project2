The International Energy Agency said in its Monthly Oil MarketReport that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pumpedabout 21.6 million barrels of oil a day last month _ up 200,000barrels from a revised July figure of 21.4 million and 2.6 millionbarrels a day higher than last year.   The IEA estimate also is about 2 million barrels more than the19.5 million-barrel ceiling set by OPEC when it met in June.   Other sources have put OPEC's August production at between 21.5million and 21.7 million barrels. Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, arespected trade newsletter, estimated OPEC's July output at 21.8million barrels.   Too much oil last year led to a price drop of more than $5 in WTIfrom $18.52 on April 18, 1988, to the year's low of $12.60 on Oct.5. While higher demand has kept prices from falling as dramaticallythis year, prices have weakened and analysts say they could continueto do so before they recover.   By October, consumers could see a slight decline in retailgasoline prices _ about 2 cents to 3 cents, said William Veno,director of oil market analysis for Data Resources Inc.   ``The majority of the higher output came from Iran, which hadexperienced a decline in July,'' the IEA report said.   The 13 OPEC nations agreed in June to try to keep output undercontrol and prices near a target of $18 a barrel. But despite thepromises, the cartel's supply has remained strong, depressing pricesfrom their highs of last spring.   The average price of a basket of the seven OPEC-monitored crudesregistered $16.44 a barrel at the end of August, compared with $18last spring.   Prices for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark brand,have been running in the range of $18 to $19 a barrel, but otherU.S. crudes have been weaker. WTI, which a growing number ofanalysts say does not represent the market, had been up to $24 abarrel in April.   Paul Mlotok, head of energy research at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. inNew York, said OPEC's production seems to have stabilized. ``They'vekind of found their level and the market is pretty much absorbingit,'' he said.   Higher demand this year _ about 1 million barrels a day more _ isone reason prices haven't fallen further, Veno said.   Moreover, lower U.S. production and oil rig accidents in theNorth Sea and elsewhere have lowered world oil output and enabledOPEC to pump more oil without serious repercussions, said Veno.   ``In order for them not to undermine prices further andprecipitate a collapse, OPEC will have to hold production at about21.6 million barrels,'' Veno said. While fourth-quarter demand isexpected to grow, North Sea and other non-OPEC production also isexpected to grow as repairs are completed, he said.   An OPEC monitoring panel will meet in Geneva, Switzerland, onSept. 23 to analyze the market and decide whether to raise thesupply cap to around 20 million barrels a day in the last quarter ofthe year.   The United Arab Emirates produced 1.8 million barrels a day inAugust, well above its OPEC-set ceiling of about a million barrels,the IEA reported.   Kuwait's output last month was estimated at 1.6 million barrels aday, up from its target of a million barrels.   Nigeria pumped about 1.8 million barrels a day last month, higherthan its 1.4 million-barrel quota.   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, produced 4.8million barrels a day, about the same as its target.   Iran and Iraq both pumped at their quota levels of 2.8 millionbarrels a day, according to the report.   The report noted that Iraq was nearing completion of a pipelinethrough Saudi Arabia that would increase its capacity to export oilto about 3 million barrels a day.   The output of other cartel members in August was at or near theirtargets:   Indonesia, 1.2 million barrels a day; Venezuela, 1.7 millionbarrels; Algeria, 700,000 barrels; Ecuador, 300,000 barrels; Libya,1.1 million barrels; Qatar, 400,000 barrels; and Gabon, 200,000barrels.   The Paris-based IEA is an arm of the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development, made up of Western nations, includingthe United States, Japan, France, Britain and Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
