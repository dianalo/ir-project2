After several months' interruption, Iran resumed shipping free oil to Syria a few days ago. Saudi Arabia has countered with a tacit offer of even more free oil if Syria moves away from supporting Iran in its war against Iraq, according to Arab diplomatic sources.    The Iranian-Syrian accord, struck in Tehran between the two countries' oil ministers, provides Syria with 20,000 barrels of free oil a day, valued at more than $1 billion a year at current prices, and an additional 40,000 barrels of oil a day at a slight discount.    That is financially attractive for Syria, whose own oil production of light crude, which it needs to feed its refineries, is rising from a current level of 60,000 barrels a day to an expected 120,000 barrels a day by year-end, according to the well-informed Middle East Economic Survey.    But Arab industry sources asserted yesterday that Iran's gesture has been quietly countered by an enticing Saudi offer of anywhere from 20,000 to 50,000 barrels daily if the Syrians cool their support for Iran in the Persian Gulf fighting. Saudi Arabia has given financial support to Syria for some time but appears to be escalating its efforts to break the deadlock that has kept the Iraq-Iran war going into its seventh year with no end in sight.    Arab sources said the Saudi move is part of a coming significant effort by Arab moderate regimes, led by Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, to rally Arab ranks on several issues. These include the long-simmering differences between Algeria and Morocco and Egypt's estrangement from the Arab world over its peace with Israel.    The Saudi move, Arab sources noted, comes after several recent snags which have arisen in Iran's relations with Libya -- its only Arab supporter besides Syria -- over Iran's policy in Lebanon and its determination to continue the war against Iraq.    Iran previously had an even bigger oil arrangement with Syria. That crumbled last year, however, as the two countries disagreed over Syria's policies in Lebanon, where Iran maintains strong ties and a significant measure of control over a million Lebanese Shiite Moslems, whose militants Iran supports.    Although the new Iranian-Syrian deal was struck in return for an understanding that the government of President Hafez Al-Assad won't waver from its support of Iran, Arab diplomatic and oil industry sources say the usually mercurial Syrian president may be inclined to accept the Saudi offer.    One reason is that the concerted effort by Arab moderates to bring about a conciliation between the two rival regimes of Baghdad and Damascus seems to be making headway.    Although Jordanian authorities denied it, a number of Arab and Western sources assert that a secret summit meeting took place on April 27 between the Iraqi and Syrian presidents under Saudi and Jordanian auspices in a location joining the borders of Iraq, Syria and Jordan. It isn't the first such encounter. Last year, Syrian and Iraqi officials also met at the borders, prompting Iranian anger and a cutoff of the oil aid.    Arab moderates, led by Saudi Arabia with the strong support of other Arab Gulf states plus Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia, are attempting to convince Syria's president that Iran's war is an assault not only on Iraq but also on the Arab nations.    This sentiment manifested itself first during the summit meeting of Islamic heads of state in Kuwait in January as waves of Iranian armed troops escalated their attacks on the Iraqi port city of Basra. The pan-Arab feeling strengthened when Iran escalated its threats to Arab tankers sailing the Persian Gulf by boarding many ships and stationing surface-to-surface missiles along its shoreline aimed at Kuwaiti ports and Gulf shipping. </TEXT></DOC>
