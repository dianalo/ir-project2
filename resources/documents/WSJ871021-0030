As previously reported, the convenience store concern is in the process of going private through a $4 billion leveraged buy-out led by the three sons of the company's founder. Before the company announced its plan to go private in July, its stock traded heavily and the price climbed amid rumors that a potential acquirer was considering a bid.    In May and June, Southland issued news releases saying it didn't know the reason for its stock's activity. But after the buy-out was disclosed, the company said in SEC documents that Canadian investor Samuel Belzberg had approached Southland about possibly acquiring the company. Southland said it didn't disclose the talks because Mr. Belzberg never made a bona fide offer.    A lawyer for Southland couldn't be reached for comment on the SEC's action. The investigation, which Southland called a &quot;private order of investigation,&quot; was disclosed in proxy materials filed with the commission.    As previously reported, closely held Thompson Co. already has purchased about two-thirds of Southland's common shares through a tender offer and has scheduled a special shareholders' meeting for Nov. 5 to complete the purchase. Thompson is offering $61.32 a share in cash and 0.6672 share of a new preferred stock for each share still outstanding.    A spokeswoman for Southland said Southland is evaluating the current market drop but hasn't proposed any changes in the offer.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Southland closed at $47, down $12.50. </TEXT></DOC>
