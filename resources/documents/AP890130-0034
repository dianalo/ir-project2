WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pope John Paul II today warned againstexcessive use of lay people in priestly functions and said theVatican is studying the entire question of non-ordained ministries.   In a 196-page document on the role of the laity in church andsociety, the pope also urged women to play a greater role in thechurch _ though not as priests _ and said the Vatican was tighteningcontrol over lay movements and organizations.   The 42,000-word document, entitled ``The Lay Members of Christ'sFaithful People,'' is the pontiff's response to issues raised byRoman Catholic bishops from around the world at the 1987 synod onthe laity at the Vatican.   The synod, which convenes every few years to advise the pope onvarious issues facing the church, was dominated by the women's issueand the question of non-ordained ministries. These include lector,acolyte and altar server _ people who assist during Mass.   During the synod, U.S. bishops made proposals to open upnon-ordained ministries to women. Others, especially Africanbishops, opposed the idea.   Under church law, women are barred from those functions. But inthe United States and some other countries, women and girlssometimes fill those roles informally, without installation.   In his document, the pope disclosed that a commission had beenformed to study the entire question of lay ministries. Until thecommission completes its work, he urged local churches not to act ontheir own, saying they should ``faithfully respect'' the currentregulations.   The pope said the distinction between clergy and laity issometimes blurred, leading bishops to criticize the``too-indiscriminate use of the word `ministry'...the lack ofobservance of ecclesiastical laws and norms...and the tendencytowards a `clericalization' of the lay faithful.''   He said there have been abuses of the church law allowing laymento carry out certain functions in ``situations of emergency andchronic necessity,'' such as lack of priests or deacons. Thesefunctions include presiding over liturgical prayers, conferringbaptism and distributing communion.   The pope said pastors should exercise ``maximum care'' inassigning these roles to lay people.   A senior Vatican official said the pope appeared to be firing``warning shots'' indicating there could be more controls overnon-ordained ministries rather than a decision to open them to women.   ``He's certainly not saying, `Hold on girls, your time iscoming,''' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.``The statements tend more toward a restrictive presence of laypeople in ministries.''   The pope devoted 17 pages to the role of women but broke no newground in his position, most recently set out in his document ``Onthe Dignity of Women'' issued in September.   He condemned all discrimination against women but reaffirmed thatthey cannot be ordained as priests.   The pope praised the ``decisive'' role that women have playedthroughout the history of the church, adding, ``It is necessary thatthis history continue, indeed that it be expanded andintensified....''   John Paul said women can play a greater role in decision-making,noting that church law allows them to serve on various diocese-levelcouncils. At the same time, he noted that some bishops had expressedconcern that focusing on women would neglect the role of men.   ``In reality various sectors in the church must lament theabsence or the scarcity of the presence of men, some of whomabdicate their proper church responsibilities, allowing them to befulfilled only by women,'' the document says.   The pope also addressed the bishops' concerns about laymovements, which have become more vocal in recent years, especiallyin Europe and Latin America.   The pope said there is a need for ``clear and definite criteriafor discerning and recognizing such lay groups,'' includingguidelines calling for ``strong and authentic communion'' with thepope and conformity to church teaching.   He said the Vatican is preparing a list of officially approvedassociations.   The document touched on many of the pope's familiar themes,urging lay people to work for peace, justice, human rights andreligious freedom and to combat secularism, atheism and abortion.</TEXT></DOC>
