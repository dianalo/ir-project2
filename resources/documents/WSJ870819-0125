Now 86, the ageless Mr. Berger, who also has written books on impeachment, the death penalty and executive privilege, is celebrating the bicentennial of the Constitution with another volume on our founding charter.    This time he writes about federalism, not the most exciting subject. Observers of all political persuasions agree that the federalism of two centuries ago is either dead or pretty close to death. Especially since the New Deal, Washington has made a habit of usurping state authority, and now conservatives and liberals alike join hands in the continuing national power grab. Rarely a month passes that federalism does not suffer some defeat or other. Consider the relatively new federal statute that tells the states to raise their legal drinking ages to 21, or else lose millions of dollars in federal highway funds -- a law upheld by the Supreme Court this year.    If Mr. Berger has not picked a best-selling topic for our time, at least he has chosen one that would have appealed to the Founding Fathers. Federalism -- the distribution of power between the federal government and the states -- was the key issue of the Constitutional Convention. During the bicentennial certainly someone should dust off this topic, and few are better suited for the task than Mr. Berger, who specializes in amassing historical evidence and following the argument where it may lead.    &quot;Federalism: The Founders' Design&quot; (University of Oklahoma Press, 232 pages, $16.95) is worth reading not just out of bicentennial interest. It is especially worth reading because the Constitution is our fundamental law, and federalism is an integral part of it. If we are to take the Constitution seriously as law, we must take its principle of federalism seriously and be willing to apply it to our political life. Obviously the first step in this direction is to grasp the founders' original design.    James Madison, to whom Mr. Berger dedicates his book, wrote in &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; that the jurisdiction of the national government would extend &quot;to certain enumerated objects only&quot; and leave &quot;to the States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects,&quot; and also that &quot;the general powers are limited&quot; and &quot;the States, in all unenumerated cases, are left in enjoyment of their sovereign and independent jurisdiction.&quot; Two years after the Constitution was ratified, the 10th Amendment was added to it, as Mr. Berger says, &quot;to put the obvious beyond peradventure.&quot;    Mr. Berger does not leave the issue of federalism simply at the level of general theory. Much of his book examines specific parts of the Constitution that, in the view of some scholars, politicians and judges, enable the federal government to intrude at will upon the states.    Thus, Mr. Berger inquires into the original intent of the &quot;necessary and proper,&quot; the &quot;supremacy,&quot; and the &quot;general welfare&quot; clauses, and also the &quot;commerce&quot; clause, the provision most often used to invade the domain of the states. In each instance he rejects -- correctly in my view -- interpretations that conduce to unlimited federal power. For example, Mr. Berger concludes that the necessary and proper clause was designed specifically to authorize the employment of means to carry out enumerated powers, not to imply new ones. And he argues that the commerce clause was framed in order to prevent &quot;internecine exactions&quot; between the states, not to facilitate federal regulation of intrastate matters, as has so frequently occurred.    Perhaps the most compelling chapter concerns a 1985 Supreme Court opinion, written by Justice Harry A. Blackmun, which held that municipal mass transit is governed by federal minimum wages and hours standards. Justice Blackmun's opinion refused to enforce the terms of the 10th Amendment, making only passing reference to it, and basically left protection of the prerogatives of the states in the hands of Congress -- a fox guarding the hen house indeed! Mr. Berger exposes the weaknesses of Mr. Blackmun's argument, and bluntly criticizes the court for its unwillingness to apply the 10th Amendment: &quot;It abdicated a duty the Constitution imposes.&quot;    &quot;What is to be done?&quot; That is the question Mr. Berger asks in conclusion, and there are many who will say that at this stage in our history nothing can be done, that federalism has no substantial constituency, neither in the federal government, including the judiciary, nor in the states. &quot;This monograph, I have been told,&quot; he writes, &quot;is a quixotic undertaking.&quot; One must hope not. &quot;Federalism: The Founders' Design&quot; merits attention from those involved in litigation on the often difficult questions federalism presents. Equally, it deserves careful consideration by policy makers at all levels of government and in both branches.    ---   Mr. Eastland is director of public affairs for the Justice Department. </TEXT></DOC>
