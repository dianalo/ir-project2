Armedwith foreign passports and drawn by well-paying jobs, manyHong Kong people living abroad have started a flow of reverseemigration.   The number of returnees is dwarfed by those leaving theBritish colony. But in Canada, for example, where some105,000 immigrants have arrived from Hong Kong since 1986,there is increasing talk in the Chinese community aboutfriends who have returned or are planning to move back toHong Kong.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I have many old friends who have returned to their familybusinesses in Hong Kong,&quot; says Andrea Eng, president of theHong Kong Canada Business Association. &quot;They are going backbecause Asia is experiencing so much economic growth, andthere's also a shortage of manpower in Hong Kong.&quot; There alsois a sense that it's easier to accumulate wealth quickly inHong Kong, says Ms. Eng.   There are 35,000 to 40,000 Canadian citizens living inHong Kong, the largest Canadian community in Asia, saysGeorge Yuen, chief information officer of the Hong KongEconomic and Trade Office in Toronto. But &quot;it's verydifficult to keep track&quot; of how many are emigrants who havereturned. &quot;People move to and fro&quot; for different reasons, andsome may have returned on extended vacations to visitrelatives, he says.   The number of emigrants returning to Hong Kong isestimated at about 6% of the number who leave each year. Ofthe 62,000 people who left Hong Kong in 1990, nearly 29,000settled in Canada, according to the Ministry of Employmentand Immigration Canada. Last year's flow to Canada dropped toabout 20,000.   For its part, the Hong Kong government tries vigorously tolure back former residents to help offset a chronic laborshortage. It advertises civil-service job vacancies in majornewspapers abroad. In December, the government, inpartnership with Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp. and theHong Kong Institute of Personnel Management, opened arecruitment office in Toronto. The agency, a branch of HongKong IPM Manpower International Ltd., targets all Canadianswho are looking for employment in the colony, not just thosewho had left Hong Kong.   Toronto has a sizable population of Hong Kong emigrants,many with professional qualifications. IPM intends to openoffices in Vancouver, another city attractive to Hong Kongemigrants, and in Australia, the U.S. and Singapore.   With emigration from Hong Kong expected to reach recordlevels in 1994, IPM expects the rate of returnees to HongKong to peak a few years after that. That is based on theassumption that a majority of emigrants will be settling inCanada and will qualify for citizenship after three years.Reverse emigration from the U.S. is less significant thanfrom Canada, in part because it takes longer, five years, foran immigrant to obtain U.S. citizenship.   One of the more visible signs of a growing interest intapping the emigrant pool is an increase in the number ofjob-vacancy ads placed by Hong Kong companies inChinese-language publications in Canada. &quot;Several {Hong Kong}companies have been advertising in business magazines here,&quot;says Ms. Eng of the Hong Kong Canada Business Association.   A joint advertising campaign was launched late last yearby several Hong Kong higher-education institutions aimed atrecruiting academics to teach in Hong Kong, says Ernest Yin,chief financial officer at Caldwell Partners International, aToronto executive search firm. In addition, he says, &quot;There'sa very significant demand for qualified individuals,particularly in the fields of finance, manufacturing andengineering.&quot;   Other factors contributing to the reverse flow ofemigrants is the shrinking job market in recession-hit Canadaand the frustration experienced by many new settlers whenthey find that their professional qualifications aren't fullyrecognized by Canadian companies. Says Joseph AuYeung, adirector of Toronto's Mandarin Club: &quot;Opportunities, bothbusiness-wise and job-wise, are bad here.&quot; In moving to HongKong after becoming citizens, many of the returnees will beable to &quot;get back the seniority and benefits&quot; they had intheir old jobs, he says.   Many immigrants come to Canada with the intention ofstaying, says Joseph Fung, a program director at the UnitedChinese Community Enrichment Services Society in Vancouver.But for professionals, &quot;reestablishing themselves in a newsociety isn't easy,&quot; says Mr. Fung, whose organizationprovides counseling services to newly arrived Hong Kongfamilies. Although many people have reduced expectations intheir job searches, &quot;there's difficulty even in getting ajunior-level position. After a few years of struggling, theymight go back,&quot; he says.   While the number of returnees to Hong Kong is growing, themajority of Hong Kong emigrants still seem committed tostaying in Canada, as indicated in a survey by IPM. Thesurvey, released last May, found that 57% of respondents saidthey probably wouldn't return to Hong Kong, while 17%intended to return. The rest were undecided.   The main reasons cited by respondents for wanting to stayin Canada was the quality of education, better livingconditions and Hong Kong's uncertain political future.Reasons cited by respondents who intended to return wereadaptation difficulties, the cost of living in Canada, andthe fact that they already had gained Canadian citizenship.</TEXT></DOC>
