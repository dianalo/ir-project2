Drawing on her experience as the first lady in Manila, she threwa party.   It featured Filipino food and entertainment, including Mrs.Marcos' own soprano rendering of ``God Bless America.''

The 100-plus guests also included court personnel, and friendsand relatives who had sat every day in the courtroom, lending moralsupport to Mrs. Marcos as the government tried to prove her andKhashoggi guilty of fraud and obstructing justice.   Khashoggi stayed only briefly. He said he was flying later toSaudi Arabia to make a long delayed visit to Islam's holy shrinesin Mecca.

Mrs. Marcos said during the party that she has been ordered bythe U.S. Justice Department to face grand jury questioning inanother criminal proceeding, one involving a lawsuit by the currentPhilippines government against Westinghouse Electric Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
