Strongemission correlates with a disturbed morphology for the galaxy, and thereis an indication that in tidally disturbed galaxies the emission is moreconcentrated towards the galaxy centre than for non-disturbed galaxies.One explanation of the results is that massive star formation is triggeredby gravitational interactions between spiral galaxies falling onto thecluster.</TEXT></DOC>
