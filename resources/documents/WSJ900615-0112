Bulkeley   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/15/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A5C</SO><CO>   GD UTX</CO><IN>ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)</IN><LP>   Two new reports point to more tough economic times aheadfor much of the Northeast.   Chief executive officers of midsized companies in NewYork, New Jersey and Connecticut have turned more pessimisticabout the economy, with the majority expecting a recession in1991, according to a survey sponsored by National WestminsterBancorp., a New York-based unit of National Westminster BankPLC, London.</LP><TEXT>   And the New England economy -- already battered by a realestate collapse and the shrinkage of many of the region'scomputer companies -- is expected to suffer from a cutback inthe defense budget over the next five years. Those cuts couldcause a 1% to 2% job loss in the region, according to asoon-to-be-published article by Yolanda K. Henderson, aneconomist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.   Two-thirds of the 550 chief executives in the NatWestsurvey said the national economy worsened over the past year,while only 6% saw improvement. The proportion of themexpecting a recession in the coming year rose to 54% from 44%a year ago.   But the executives were more upbeat about their ownindustries than about the overall economy. Nearly 60% saidthey expect business to be better next year, only slightlylower than last year's 63%. As for the current year, 49% saidbusiness has improved from 1989 levels. The report sampledcompanies in 50 industries with annual sales ranging from $5million to $250 million.   The discrepancy between the executives' national and localoutlooks seemed more psychological than economic, said PeterA. Radford, NatWest's chief economist. &quot;They feel they havemore control and more knowledge about customers and orderbooks, so they have more confidence about their own economythan the national economy,&quot; he said.   However, Mr. Radford said, views across the tri-stateregion are more diverse this year than last. Officials in NewYork City were the most pessimistic, while those inWestchester County, just north of the city, were the mostoptimistic in the latest survey. The readings were reflectedin a business confidence index, measuring the degree ofexecutive optimism in several areas including expansion,borrowing, hiring and relocation.   That index was highest in Westchester, with a reading of95, down from last year's 101 but much higher than New YorkCity's 75. Last year, the city reading was 93. The index uses1988 as a base level of 100. Mr. Radford said New York Cityand New Jersey readings probably were depressed by news oflarge state and local budget deficits.   The survey also found that companies in the region areoperating at 78.4% of capacity, down from 81.6% a year ago. Adownward trend was also noted in expansion plans: 55% of theofficials said they expect to expand in the next two years,down from 58% a year ago.   The executives said major drawbacks in the tri-state areainclude rising health care costs, state and local taxes,crime, cost of office space, and drugs in the workplace. Themajor benefit cited was the sizable local market for goodsand services.   Ms. Henderson, the economist at the Federal Reserve Bankof Boston, writes in an article to be published this summerthat defense contracting amounts to about 8% of the NewEngland economy, compared with 5.9% nationally, so defensecuts will have a disproportionate effect.   Moreover, she writes, defense spending will probably becut more sharply in New England than in other regions becausethe region has a disproportionate share of procurementrevenue, and procurement is likely to be slashed more thanother areas of the defense budget such as personnel ormaintenance.   Connecticut, where 7.5% of all goods and services producedare for military use, is likely to be hit especially hard,she says in the article, citing the state's aircraft andsubmarine contracts in particular.   General Dynamics Co.'s Electric Boat division makessubmarines in Connecticut, and United Technologies Corp.'shelicopter and jet engine operations are in the state aswell.   Massachusetts, where more of the procurement revenue comesfrom missile and electronics work, probably won't be hit ashard, she writes.   In terms of employment, she projects that if defensespending is cut by $4.1 billion over five years as proposedby President Bush, the region would lose 57,000 jobs, or 0.9%of its non-agricultural work force. Sharper cutbacks favoredby some in Congress would result in losses of as many as134,000 jobs or 2% of the work force. Moreover, she said,these jobs are typically relatively highly paid and held byexperienced workers who will have a difficult time findingother suitable jobs.   &quot;These projected slowdowns in defense-related activitiesare far from devastating, but they will feel burdensome inthe context of simultaneous weakness in the real estate,financial services and computer industries,&quot; Ms. Hendersonwrites.</TEXT></DOC>
