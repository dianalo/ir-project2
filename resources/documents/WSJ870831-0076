Mr. Sofer, whose cooperation with federal authorities was disclosed last month, will pay nearly $2.5 million in proceeds under the agreement, these people said. The agreement covers any possible action against him by both federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission, these people said.    In return, Mr. Sofer is expected to furnish evidence against, among others, Nahum Vaskevitch, a former managing director in charge of mergers and acquisitions in Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s London office.    Mr. Sofer's New York attorney, Stanley Arkin, declined comment.    Gerald Harris, a New York attorney representing Mr. Vaskevitch, declined to comment on Mr. Sofer's reported agreement.    In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint in federal court here, charging that Mr. Vaskevitch leaked confidential information about numerous transactions to Mr. Sofer. The agency further charged that Mr. Sofer traded in securities on the basis of this information and also spurred others to do so. The SEC alleged that the scheme generated more than $4 million in illegal profit. </TEXT></DOC>
