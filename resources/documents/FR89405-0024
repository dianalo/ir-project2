Background</ITAG>A detailed discussion of the regulation which implemented the use of civilpenalty moneys and explains the Post Act Reclamation program may be foundat 53 FR 16016, May 4, 1988.Congress, in the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act for fiscalyear 1989 authorized the Secretary of the Interior to utilize money collectedpursuant to the payment of civil penalties under section 518 of the Actto reclaim lands adversely affected by coal mining practices after August3, 1977, to remain available until expended (Pub. L. 100-446). The appropriationslanguage provides in part:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * Provided, That notwithstanding any other provision of law, theSecretary of the Interior, pursuant to regulations, may utilize directlyor through grants to States, moneys collected in fiscal year 1989 pursuantto the assessment of civil penalties under section 518 of the Surface MiningControl and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1268), to reclaim landsadversely affected by coal mining practices after August 3, 1977, to remainavailable until expended. * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Final Rule</ITAG>The reader is referred to a detailed discussion of 30 CFR 845.21 at 53FR 16016, May 14, 1988, for an explanation of the rule implementing Pub.L. 100-202, which allows use of civil penalty money for reclamation ofpost 1977 sites.The present regulation amends 30 CFR 845.21(a) to implement the intentof Congress which authorizes the use of civil penalties collected in Fiscal1989 until such funds are expended.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Procedural Matters</ITAG>Federal Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  The DOI has determined that this document is not a major rule under thecriteria of Executive Order 12291 (February 17, 1981) and certifies thatit will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial numberof small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq</T3>. This rule does not distinguish between small and largeentities. These determinations are based on the findings that the regulatoryadditions in the rule will not change costs to industry or to the Federal,State, or local government. Furthermore, the rule produces no adverse effecton competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or theability of United States enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets.  National Environmental Policy Act  OSMRE prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for the May 4, 1988 regulation(53 FR 16016) that implemented the use of civil penalty moneys for postact reclamation. OSMRE determined at that time that there were no significantadverse impacts on the quality of the human environment that required preparationof an environmental impact statement within the meaning of section 102(2)(C)of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).A ``Finding of No Significant Impact'' (FONSI) was issued and includedin the OSMRE administrative record at the address specified previously(see ``<T2>ADDRESSES</T2>''). OMSRE has examined the rule being adopted here anddetermined that the analysis included in the EA prepared for the May 4,1988, rule remains applicable. OSMRE has prepared a FONSI for the finalrule reaffirming the finding that there will not be any significant adverseenvironmental impacts.  Administrative Procedure Act  This regulation is exempt from the public notice rulemaking requirementsof the Administrative Procedure Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). Noticeand comment on the regulation are unnecessary since the regulation merelyadopts without policy alternatives a technical change provided by Congressin the Agency's Appropriation Act for FY '89.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Author  </ITAG>The principal author of this rule is Raymond E.
