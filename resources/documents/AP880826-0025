The Reagan administration's Office of Management and Budgetprojected Thursday that the fiscal 1989 federal deficit would comein just under the $146 billion target set in the Gramm-Rudmanbalanced budget law.   Under that legislation, if the budget office determines that thered ink will exceed $146 billion, spending on defense and domesticprograms must be slashed automatically by whatever amount isnecessary to shrink the deficit to $136 billion.   ``In that case, congressional overspending will triggeracross-the-board cuts that slash high priority programs every bitas much as lower priority programs,'' President Reagan warned fromLos Angeles, where he is vacationing.   OMB estimated that, including programs enacted through Aug. 15,the fiscal 1989 deficit would be $144 billion. When figuring inprograms signed into law over the last few days, the amount of redink grew to $145.3 billion, just $700 million below the $146billion budget-cut trigger.   White House budget chief James C. Miller III noted that whenlawmakers return from their summer recess next month, they plan toconsider a collection of popular bills _ including hunger relief,anti-drug programs, welfare reform, child care and a minimum-wageincrease _ that would boost the deficit beyond $146 billion.   Miller told reporters that if those bills were enacted,lawmakers would have to find compensating savings elsewhere or facethe automatic cuts, which are ``something I don't think anybody intheir right mind'' wants.   House Budget Committee Chairman William H. Gray III, D-Pa., saidhe believed spending would be kept under control.   ``It's clear that Congress and the president are going to haveto walk a fiscal tightrope in the coming weeks, but I believe wecan maintain our balance and avoid crippling, across-the-boardcuts,'' Gray said in a prepared statement.   Lawmakers are considered unlikely to set off the Gramm-Rudmanprocess of spending cuts and risk the wrath of voters angry becausetheir favorite programs have been slashed.   On Aug. 19, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the 1989deficit at $153 billion, an amount that would trigger $17 billionin cuts. That projection, which serves only as a guideline forlawmakers, was based on more pessimistic economic assumptions thanthose used by the administration.   Fiscal 1989 begins Oct. 1. OMB's final, binding calculation ofnext year's projected deficit is due Oct. 15.   The OMB estimates the deficit for the current fiscal year at$152.3 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
