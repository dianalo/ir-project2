(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Army crews Wednesday retrieved thelast eight bodies of 17 soldiers killed when two helicopters on anight training mission collided, then plunged 250 feet to theground and caught fire.   The UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters from Fort Campbell spewedwreckage for hundreds of yards and charred the partially wooded,gently rolling site six miles from the choppers' air field Tuesdaynight.   ``One aircraft is located in the trees. One aircraft is right onthe edge of a clearing,'' said Maj. Randy Schoel, Fort Campbellspokesman.   It was the worst Army aviation disaster since 248 soldiers basedat Fort Campbell were killed in 1985 in the crash of a charteredplane in Gander, Newfoundland, Schoel said.   The Blackhawk, one of the newer helicopters used by the Army,Air Force and Marine Corps, has been grounded four times in threeyears. Last summer officials said about 40 people had been killedin crashes of the helicopter since 1978.   ``I would say now there is no indication of any mechanicalfactor'' in the crash, said Chief Warrant Officer Joe Adams of theinvestigation team from the Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, Ala.``We are looking at human and environmental factors. The humanfactors might include some restriction of vision.''   Four bodies were taken from the wreckage of each helicopterWednesday, Schoel said.   Schoel said the crash occurred on the western Kentucky-Tennesseeborder during a ``routine night mission,'' and left no survivors.   ``Obviously, there's an element of risk in everything we do. Wetrain up to a standard that reduces that risk to an absoluteminimum,'' Schoel said. ``Yes it can be, but it's not necessarily,more dangerous to fly at night.''   The helicopters were flying at 92 mph air speed and about 250feet from the ground when they collided, Schoel said. One of threehelicopters flying in formation was hit by a fourth, said WilliamHarralson, deputy public affairs officer at the fort.   ``There were three aircraft in formation, if you want to sayducks in a row, headed east, and another who was flying solo, hitone of those,'' said Harralson. ``There can be 10 or 12battalion-sized groups working at Fort Campbell at one time.''   ``We have been told by the tower that the weather was good,'' hesaid.   The solo helicopter carried four servicemen; the 13 others werein the other aircraft.   Adams said the weather was good, which in military terms meansvisibility of better than a mile and a cloud ceiling of at least500 feet.   One helicopter crashed on the Tennessee side of the border, theother in Kentucky. Although the soldiers were carrying personalweapons, such as M-16 rifles, the helicopters were not armed,Schoel said.   One of the other Blackhawk helicopters returned to the airfield; the other landed at the crash site.   ``They witnessed the accident. They were providing statements tothe investigators, and the decision was made not to make them flyit back,'' Schoel said.   A team from the Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, Ala., wascalled to investigate. A safety expert from Sikorsky Aircraft inStratford, Conn., the helicopter's manufacturer, also sent a safetyexpert.   The Army identified three of the dead as Staff Sgt. Charles L.Shirley, 21, of Arkansas; Sgt. Dennis Sabot, 28, of Iowa; and Spec.4 Samuel A. Hintz, 23, of Ohio, all from the 2nd Battalion, 502ndInfantry. Home towns were not provided. Names of the other victimswere withheld pending notification of relatives.   The Army's fleet of 820 UH-60s was grounded twice in May 1987,once for inspection and once because of a design flaw. The entirefleet also was grounded in April 1985 and March 1986 after fatalcrashes. In 1985, the Army identified a defect in the main rotorassembly and ordered it corrected.   Army Undersecretary James R. Ambrose said in November he hadconfidence in the Blackhawk. Noting news reports that radio andmicrowave towers on the ground can interfere with the aircraft'selectronic control systems, he said no safety hazard had been found.   ``The Blackhawk has a safety record at least four times betterthan the aircraft it replaced,'' said Bob Stangarone, a spokesmanfor Sikorsky, a division of United Technologies.   Stangarone noted the Army has shown its confidence in theBlackhawk by awarding Sikorsky multiyear contracts for thehelicopter.   The Blackhawk is designed primarily as a utility and assaultaircraft and is used in air assault, air cavalry and medicalevacuation, said Maj. Phil Soucy, a spokesman for the Army inWashington.   Soucy said there had been no move by safety investigators toground the Blackhawk fleet as a result of the accident.   The helicopter normally is operated with a crew of three and cancarry 11 combat-equipped soldiers.   Fort Campbell was the home base of 248 soldiers killed Dec. 12,1985, when a chartered jet bringing them home for Christmas frompeacekeeping duties in the Sinai Peninsula crashed in Gander,Newfoundland.</TEXT></DOC>
