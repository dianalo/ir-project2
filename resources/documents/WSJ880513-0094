The women strongly believed a new brand of roach killer sold in little plastic trays was far more effective and less messy than traditional bug sprays. Yet they had never bought it, sticking stubbornly with their old sprays.    To try to understand this contradiction, the researchers asked the women to draw pictures of roaches and write stories about their sketches. What McCann-Erickson hoped to do was probe the women's subconscious feelings about roaches. Before advising a client on developing a new insecticide, the agency wanted to know how people really relate to roaches.    According to Paula Drillman, the agency's director of strategic planning, the roaches in the pictures were all male, symbolizing men who the women said had abandoned them and left them feeling poor and powerless. &quot;Killing the roaches with a bug spray and watching them squirm and die allowed the women to express their hostility toward men and have greater control over the roaches,&quot; Ms. Drillman says.    McCann's figure drawings are a sign of advertisers' growing use of research techniques borrowed from psychology and other behavioral sciences. To sell products in the 1980s, people on Madison Avenue increasingly feel they must put consumers on the couch and play shrink.    &quot;We're using a whole battery of psychological techniques -- some new and some old -- to understand the emotional bond between consumers and brands,&quot; says Ms. Drillman. &quot;You have to sell on emotion more than ever because it's a world of parity products out there. The days of having a competitive edge and a special product benefit are long gone.&quot;    The disastrous failure of new Coke in 1985 also has spurred advertisers to pay more attention to consumers' emotional ties to products and rely less on standard focus group interviews and taste tests. &quot;Brands are not just commercial products we buy and use; they're our companions in life as well,&quot; declares Rosalinde Rago, director of advertising research at the Ogilvy andamp; Mather agency.    The Foote, Cone andamp; Belding ad agency is using picture-sorting studies more often nowadays. What researchers do is give consumers stacks of photographs of people's faces and ask them to sort out who might be the typical users of certain brands. Each face represents a different emotional reaction to a product.    In addition to figure drawings, McCann-Erickson also is asking consumers to write newspaper obituaries for brands. The agency's researchers say they learn a lot about a product's image depending upon whether people describe the brand as young and virile and the victim of a tragic accident, or as a worn-out product succumbing to old age.    Advertising researchers are especially fascinated with the right brain/left brain concept. For instance, the N.W. Ayer agency tells people to draw shapes with their left hands to show their reactions to new product ideas. &quot;Since the right hemisphere of the brain is visual, symbolic and emotional and it controls the left half of the body, this technique taps into perceptions better expressed as images rather than words,&quot; says Fred Posner, a senior vice president at Ayer.    All this psychological analysis harks back to the 1950s, when ad agencies first became enamored of social scientists and motivational research. Back then, it seemed quite sinister. In his book &quot;The Hidden Persuaders,&quot; Vance Packard cautioned: &quot;With all this interest in manipulating the customer's subconscious, the old slogan 'let the buyer beware' began taking on a new and more profound meaning.&quot;    Today, ad agencies' psychological research is even more pervasive and sophisticated, but not nearly as controversial. What criticism there is comes mostly from within the advertising business itself. &quot;The subconscious techniques of clinical psychologists have yet to prove their utility,&quot; says Peter Kim, the head of the consumer behavior department at the J. Walter Thompson ad agency. &quot;I'm really skeptical about these psychoanalysts who talk about people's phallic stage in relation to their car purchases.&quot;    But other agency research executives insist that verbal techniques alone simply aren't sufficient. They maintain that people aren't able to express many of their feelings in words, either because they're not conscious of them or because they're uncomfortable sharing them with a stranger conducting the interview.    That's why the McCann-Erickson ad agency resorted to stick-figure sketches in research on its American Express Gold Card account. Focus group interviews hadn't made clear consumers' differing perceptions of gold-card and green-card holders.    The drawings, however, were much more illuminating. In one set, for example, the gold-card user was portrayed as a broad-shouldered man standing in an active position, while the green card user was a &quot;couch potato&quot; in front of a TV set. Based on such pictures and other research, the agency decided to market the gold card as &quot;a symbol of responsibility for people who have control over their lives and finances.&quot;    While psychologists on McCann's own staff analyze consumers' drawings, some agencies prefer to consult with psychoanalysts in private clinical practice. &quot;We don't want psychologists who specialize in market research,&quot; says Penelope Queen, director of planning and research at the Saatchi andamp; Saatchi DFS Compton agency. &quot;We prefer practicing doctors who do true psychoanalysis with patients and really know what makes people tick.&quot;    Saatchi recently brought in therapist Samuel Cohen to tap people's innermost feelings about cold medicine. The agency expects the psychoanalysis to inspire it when it creates ads for a new over-the-counter medicine. Part of Mr. Cohen's session with a New York City travel agent went like this: &quot;I see a gurgling waterfall and hear a woman's voice saying, 'You're safe from the pain,'&quot; the man says, describing an imaginary dream to Mr. Cohen. &quot;It's a sensual, mysterious voice, not like my mom's. Mom was always there for me, but I didn't crave her as a child.&quot;    And just what do the shrink and the agency's researchers make of the travel agent's imaginary dream about cold medicine personified as an alluring siren? The waterfall, it seems, represents the soothing effect of the cold medicine, while the seductive woman reflects his desire to be coddled by someone. The woman, however, can't be his mother because he doesn't want to regress to his childhood.    This doesn't exactly rank up there with Sigmund Freud's &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams.&quot; But Saatchi believes so strongly in psychoanalysis that it keeps seven practicing clinical psychologists on retainer to study consumers' emotional responses to the brands it advertises -- everything from Wrangler jeans to Molson beer.    Saatchi credits the psychological research with helping to inspire one of the agency's funniest, most talked about campaigns -- its Philips light bulb commercials. The light bulb is an undeniably boring product. But the agency's consulting psychologists found much more there than meets the eye.    &quot;When a bulb burns out, it is far more than a momentary annoyance,&quot; says Regina Kelley, a research executive at Saatchi. &quot;For that instant when the switch is hit and nothing happens, the consumer is reminded briefly but powerfully about how much he depends on his light bulb to meet his security need.&quot; Thus were born some comical Philips ads in which the light bulb fizzles at particularly awkward moments.    Saatchi also used its psychological probe last year to try to win some new business -- the $200 million Burger King ad account. In the presentation to Burger King executives, Ms. Queen, Saatchi's research director, certainly embellished the hamburger eating experience. She discussed how fast-food restaurants fulfill basic human needs for immediate oral gratification (especially important to demanding baby boomers), regression to a carefree, childlike state, and dependency on someone else. (&quot;People look to fast food almost as a surrogate mom,&quot; she says.)    She further noted that McDonald's, through such marketing gimmicks as the Ronald McDonald clown and kiddie playgrounds, created a nurturing atmosphere that satisfied many of those needs. Burger King, on the other hand, came off as aggressive, masculine and distant in the agency's psychological research.    For example, when a psychologist asked a female bank employee to describe the two fast-food chains as animals in cartoons, she characterized McDonald's as a cute, friendly baby chick and Burger King as a sly, unfriendly cat. The woman also proposed that a Burger King ad might feature aliens from outer space, an image the psychologist found rich with subconscious meanings. &quot;The alien suggests that she feels a certain distance from Burger King,&quot; the psychologist says. &quot;It's not a fun place, not quite like home like McDonald's is for her.&quot;    But Burger King executives didn't buy the psychoanalysis: The account went to N.W. Ayer, not Saatchi.    ---                  The Mind of a Roach Killer   The McCann-Erickson ad agency asked women to draw and describe how they felt about roaches. The agency concluded from the drawings that the women identified the roaches with men who had abandoned them and thus enjoyed watching the roaches-men squirm and die. That's why, the agency figured, that women prefer spray roach killers to products that don't allow the user to see the roach die.   &quot;One night I just couldn't take the horror of these bugs sneaking around in the dark. They are always crawling when you can't see them. I had to do something. I thought wouldn't it be wonderful if when I switched on the light the roaches would shrink up and die like vampires to sunlight. So I did, but they just all scattered. But I was ready with my spray so it wasn't a total loss. I got quite a few ... continued tomorrow when night time falls.&quot;   &quot;I tiptoed quietly into the kitchen perhaps he wasn't around. I stretched my arm up to the light. I hoped I'd be alone when the light went on. Perhaps he is sitting on the table I thought. You think that's impossible? Nothing is impossible with that guy. He might not even be alone. He'll run when the light goes on I thought. But what's worse is for him to slip out of sight. No, it would be better to confront him before he takes control and 'invites a companion.'&quot;   &quot;A man likes a free meal you cook for him, as long as there is food he will stay.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
