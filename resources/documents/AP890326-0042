He entered this country legally, so he must leave. Had heentered the country illegally, he could stay. Now it is too late tobecome an illegal alien and stay. So he really is an illegal alienand must go.   Don't laugh. Jack's not. Nor are his wife and four children. Ortheir friends. Or the townspeople.   ``This is a Catch-22 bureaucratic boondoggle,'' said DonnyBrown, editor of the Snyder Daily News.   Some call it the French Fiasco.   After selling their small, three-star hotel in Paris, thevacationing Pointeaus entered the United States in 1981 on touristvisas. They liked what they found. In 1982, they obtained aninvestor's visa and bought a motel in the San Franciso area.   When his night clerk was slain, Pointeau sold the motel andmoved his family to this West Texas oil town of 12,000. ThePointeaus purchased a 50 percent interest in a motel for $212,000.Pointeau's wife, Francoise, and the couple's four daughters becamehonor students in school. Pointeau joined the Rotary Club.   Now, the family must sell or surrender their motel and pack uptheir possessions. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Servicein the fall told Pointeau, 52, that the family will be deported byApril 26.   INS officials pointed to a series of alleged shortcomings butthe most critical seemed to be that Pointeau's investment was not``substantial'' and that his enterprise was marginal.   ``The regulations do not define what is substantial,'' the INSconceded, but the agency noted that some consular offices use$250,000 as a ``point of departure.''   Pointeau said he appealed to the Lubbock immigration office forhelp but was told, ``There is nothing we can do for you because youare legal.''   Rep. Charles Stenholm, a Texas Democrat, introduced legislationdesigned to rescue the family but got only a polite rebuff and aconcession that immigration laws need changing.   Referring to the recent pardon for many illegal aliens, Stenholmaide Marc Lubin said: ``What's ironic about this is that if he hadnot been here legally, if he had not renewed his visa each time, hewould have been granted amnesty.''   Attorneys say the Pointeau affair may not be all that uncommonin the wake of a recent get-tough edict by immigration officials.   In September, a petition circulated in Snyder protesting the INSaction picked up 1,837 signatures. Earlier this month, a citizensgroup pledged $3,000 to retain an attorney and pay filing fees fora lawsuit to delay deportation.   ``Now I know what is the spirit of Texas,'' Pointeau said lastweek in his disjointed English, which he speaks with a liltingFrench accent.   When Pointeau headed for Snyder and bought a stake in the motel,the town was riding the crest of an oil boom. Even after the boomwent bust, Pointeau dutifully renewed his investor's visa each yearand kept his motel afloat with hard work and modestly successfuloutside business ventures.   Meanwhile, the four children, who now range in age from 13 to21, were excelling at school.   So was Mrs. Pointeau, who graduated with high honors from anearby college and is on the verge of obtaining a master's degreein French literature. ``She will not be able to graduate if we haveto leave,'' Pointeau said.   ``Year after year, it became fact that we all were living inAmerica and that the children were receiving an eduation for afuture life in this country,'' Pointeau said. ``After having livedhere for years, we all started dreaming about becoming U.S.citizens.   ``Easy to say, tough to accomplish.''   After years of temporary visa renewals, the immigration officein Dallas notified Pointeau that another extension was being denied.   Friends believe Pointeau can buy more time with the federallawsuit.   ``We won't let this die,'' said restaurant owner Randy Perkins.``This is a great cause to fight for.''</TEXT></DOC>
