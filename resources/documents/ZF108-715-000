 They can rely on rules of thumb and past experience.andP;  They can play itsafe and add excess capacity.andP;  Or they can model the network, and reach anoptimal solution without jeopardizing the existing net.andM;To many, modeling the network before altering it is a radical idea--eitherunheard of or unnecessary.andM;&quot;As the demand on networks is increasing, the concept of network modeling andnetwork capacity planning is a new phenomenon in the data center,&quot; said EricHo, product manager at BGS Systems, Inc., Waltham, Mass.andP;  &quot;Many businessesare being consolidated and, as a result, networks are getting bigger and morecomplex.&quot;andM;Network modeling tools are used for network evaluation, performance tuningand capacity planning.andP;  They look at the existing network and how it willevolve and handle traffic loads.andM;Most network modeling tools are for IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA)networks, although a few are geared to local-area networks (LANs).andP;  Pricesrange from under $1,000 for some PC-based products to $30,000 and up forthose products that run on IBM mainframes.andM;Generally, users will also need a performance monitor or measurement tool togather the data necessary to build the model.andP;  Most network modeling toolshave some reporting capabilities.andP;  They can also be used for capacityplanning to project network growth and evaluate how that growth will impactnetwork performance.andM;Network modelers are potentially valuable to a wide range of users who havesome degree of responsibility for their networks.andP;  Typical users of modelingtools include network performance analysts, network planners and managers,protocol designers, capacity planners, systems engineers and systemsadministrators.andM;Most network modeling tools are based on queuing theory, a discrete eventmodeling technique.andP;  Queuing theory uses mathematical formulas into whichusers plug in certain characteristics--such as the number of terminalsconnected to a line and the type of messages traveling over the line--topredict response times.andM;A few products allow users to simulate their networks.andP;  Simulators mimic areal system by tracing network events and reacting to them.andM;USER SKEPTICISMandM;Some users are skeptical of the ability of existing tools to provide themodeling they need.andP;  They may also lack the skills to use a modeling tool.andM;&quot;People don't plan,&quot; said Jeff Erwin of dwb Associates, Inc., an engineeringand consulting firm in Beaverton, Ore.andP;  &quot;Nobody understands networks yet.andO;Analyzers spew forth information, and nobody knows what it means.andP;  Peoplearen't that systematic about putting a network together.&quot;andM;Many users feel that they are managing their networks just fine without doingany modeling.andP;  However, some realize that they could be on the brink oflosing control--if not today or tomorrow, someday soon.andM;Jonathan Peterson, a programmer/analyst at Barclays Bank PLC in New York,does much of the bank's PC network planning.andP;  The net runs off a largepacket-switching X.25 network.andM;The U.K.-based bank's network is based on Ethernet.andP;  It has thousands ofnodes and 20,000 users worldwide, linking all U.S.andP;  and worldwide operations.andO;The network comprises a mix-and-match of hardware and software from differentvendors.andM;Ethernet runs on top of DECnet and SNA, which in turn connect to the X.25network and leased lines.andP;  The network's PCs are a mix of IBM PS/2s, ATs, XTsand some Wang machines.andP;  &quot;We planned the network in this way to use themixture of equipment sitting in different areas,&quot; Peterson said.andM;The main processors are Wang, IBM and lots of DEC machines.andP;  There are alsosome Unix workstations.andP;  Bridges and gateways do the protocol conversion toallow different vendors' equipment to share files.andM;Peterson's only tool for network planning in this complex environment is pastexperience.andP;  &quot;We make a good guesstimate before installing hardware on thenetwork.andP;  For instance, we know by rules of thumb that we need a certainamount of network bandwidth for electronic-mail users.andP;  We also know how muchtraffic given departments will generate.andP;  Whatever we estimate, we double ortriple it.&quot;andM;Peterson does not worry that this may lead to a surfeit of capacity.andP;  &quot;Userswill fill up whatever we give them,&quot; he said.andM;Nevertheless, he is open to suggestions for improvement.andP;  &quot;If we canstreamline and find a better way that would save money and time, I'dcertainly consider it.andP;  The ideal tool would sit on the network and then tellme the optimal way to lay it out.andP;  If a tool could do some analysis based ontraffic patterns and make recommendations, that would be great.&quot;andM;NETWORK MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENTandM;Network modeling tools are available now that purport to do just that.andO;Although the number of tools out there is small, they are not easilycategorized.andP;  Modelers may be part of another network tool, such as a networkperformance monitor, analyzer, capacity planner or even a design tool.andM;&quot;Modeling tools are part of a full network management environment,&quot; saidJerry Howard, president of Quintessential Solutions, San Diego.andP;  &quot;With theproper types of tools, the cost of networks can be reduced by 20% to 40%.andO;But the issue is performance, not cost.andP;  What's going to happen when the loadincreases?&quot;andM;Quintessential offers a suite of network design tools that can also be usedto model existing networks, Howard said.andP;  &quot;Typically, networks are alwayschanging, and you need to manage those changes.&quot;andM;Network Performance Analyzer, based on an analytic queuing model, evaluatesnetwork performance by analyzing message characteristics, protocols,propagation delay and host processing times.andP;  It allows users to play&quot;what-if&quot; games to determine effects upon performance when adding devices orapplications.andP;  Alternating between the analyzer and two design tools--CircuitDesigner and Network Designer--allows users to fine-tune their networkmodels.andM;Quintessential's products run on both IBM PC and Unix-based platforms.andP;  Theyare geared to wide-area networks only, but the vendor plans to expand to LANdesign and analysis by the second half of the year.andP;  &quot;The various protocolsand operations of LANs are different, but equally complex,&quot; Howard said.andM;Bill Kelly, senior telecommunications analyst at Covia in Denver, has beenusing all the Quintessential modules for about a year.andP;  Covia's networkhandles data and voice applications for United Airlines, and provides theApollo computer reservation system to 11,000 travel agencies, encompassingsome 65,000 terminals in the U.S.andP;  alone.andP;  They use the Unix versions, whichrun on Sun-3 or Sun-4 workstations.andM;&quot;There's a lot of potential for cleaning up networks,&quot; Kelly said.andP;  &quot;We hadbeen really struggling with performance analysis, relying on spreadsheets andrules of thumb.andP;  If you're looking at networks strategically, that'sdangerous.&quot;andM;Several products are available for modeling SNA networks, often as part of anetwork monitor or performance analyzer.andM;&quot;Network modeling is a method for capacity planning,&quot; said Bill Conner,senior vice president of development at Legent Corp., Pittsburgh.andP;  &quot;You canpredict the impact of proposed changes to a system without actually makingthose changes.andP;  It helps the organization cost-effectively plan for thefuture and meet its service-level objectives.&quot;andM;Last fall, Legent added a modeling and recommendations component to itsNetspy SNA performance monitor, running on IBM mainframes under MVS or VM.andO;The modeling and recommendation halves complement each other, but they can beused independently.andM;SOME TUNING HINTSandM;Using data collected by the monitor, the recommendations component givesEnglish-language tuning hints for improving the performance on the boundarylines of SNA networks.andP;  Boundary lines connect network control programs(NCPs), which are resident in the front-end processors.andP;  &quot;Handling thebackbone [connections between the host and NCP] is mathematically morecomplex, but it's a direction in which we hope to head,&quot; Conner said.andM;The modeling side can then be used to predict the impact of thoserecommendations.andP;  Or, one can use the modeler to play &quot;what-if&quot; gamesunrelated to recommendations--for example, to project the impact of addingnew applications to the network.andM;The Southern National Bank of North Caroline in Charlotte uses Natspy'smodeling and recommendations component to model its SNA network, which coversover 100 branch locations with at least that many automatic teller machines(ATMs) in North and South Carolina.andM;&quot;Modeling and recommendations is a nice little feature,&quot; said systemsprogrammer Ken Grady.andP;  &quot;In a network monitoring situation, we might haveresponse times not being what they should be.andP;  We can pull up the line andcheck out utilization, comparing it to other lines in the network withadequate response time.andP;  What would recommendations suggest?&quot;andM;The modeler can then be used to check those recommendations.andP;  &quot;We can see ifit reflects what recommendations says, if, for example, adjustments to linespeed would result in improved response,&quot; Grady explained.andM;The CA-ISS/Three capacity planner from Computer Associates International,Inc., Garden City, N.Y., uses expert system technology to providerecommendations for SNA networks, said Ken Ballou, product marketing managerfor performance management products.andP;  The expert system can suggest upgradesor downsizing, taking into account least cost, latest technology andpreferred vendor.andM;CA-ISS/Three comprises a mainframe component, the Analyzer, which runs on IBMmainframes under MVS, and a PC component, the Capacity Planner, which runs onIBM PC/XTs and up.andP;  The Analyzer gathers performance data from a performancemonitor such as CA-Mazdamon.andP;  That data is then modeled by the CapacityPlanner's analytic queuing model.andM;According to Ballou, users can also enter their service-level objectives intothe models; for example, a two-second response time.andM;&quot;The expert system will tell you what configuration changes to make to reachthem, taking into account growth issues and increasing online transactions,&quot;Ballou said.andP;  &quot;This allows you to look at the possibilities of redistributingyour workload, make changes in the network configuration and see how onechange affects another portion of the network.&quot;andM;Jerry Howe, vice president of systems technology at KCM Computer Consulting,Inc., Greenbelt, Md., started using ISS/Three a few years ago to modelcomputer systems.andP;  &quot;We used the Analyzer to gather data, which we used tocreate a model and thus a baseline of performance.andP;  By increasing growthfactors, you can see what increased resource requirements will be.&quot;andM;Howe said he plans to use the tool for network modeling within the year.andO;&quot;It's the same process.andP;  It will make our models more complete to add networkinformation, such as response time and the number of terminals and users.&quot;andO;As network traffic increases, ISS/Three can be used to recommend when tochange the speed of the line and when to add more equipment to maintainacceptable response times, Howe said.andM;Successful network modeling requires some projections of the organization'scomputing requirements, Howe added.andP;  &quot;Each organization has a differentapproach that needs to be tailored to business requirements.andP;  If you don't,your results will be off.&quot;andM;BGS Systems offers Bestnet Boundary and Bestnet MSNF for modeling SNAnetworks.andP;  &quot;Traditionally, most companies overconfigure their networks,&quot; saidBGS' Eric Ho.andP;  &quot;They buy high-speed lines and pay for excess capacity on thenetwork, but it comes to a point where high-speed T-1 lines won't solvenetwork problems anymore.andP;  Bandwidth management becomes a problem requiring amodeling tool.&quot;andM;Ho describes the two tools as &quot;an integrated solution for host and networkmodeling.&quot;andP;  They run on IBM mainframes under MVS and VM.andP;  Bestnet Boundaryanalyzes and predicts response times, utilizations and throughput of SNAboundary networks.andP;  Bestnet MSNF is an upgrade to Boundary.andP;  MSNF looks atthe whole network with the backbone and boundaries tied together, includingthe traffic between cities and different regions.andM;Both products have two components.andP;  Capture/SNA takes existing data from aperformance monitor and combines it with configuration information toautomatically generate a network model.andP;  Best/1-SNA evaluates the informationprovided by Capture and answers &quot;what-if&quot; questions about the impact ofnetwork changes.andM;&quot;Capacity planning is a decision-support tool,&quot; said Tony White, who ismodeling development engineer at Technetronic Inc., Ottawa, Ontario.andP;  &quot;If youdon't model, you have to either guess, set up a controlled environment and dobenchmarks, or develop simulations.&quot;andM;Technetronic recently introduced the Explicit Network Capacity Planner, whichruns on an IBM PC/AT or PS/2.andP;  A host product, the Network PerformanceAnalyzer, used in conjunction with the PC-based Auto Pro-filer, allows theuser to extract data from the host and automatically download it to the PCand input it to the Capacity Planner.andM;Using the Capacity Planner as a standalone tool requires another tool toaccess performance records.andP;  Like the other SNA network modelers, theCapacity Planner allows users to test alternative network configurations andanswers &quot;what-if&quot; questions.andM;&quot;Network modeling helps users make a more efficient use of existingresources, plan intelligently for new purchases and investigate manypossibilities for improvement,&quot; White said.andP;  &quot;This helps them improve networkresponse time and make end users more productive.&quot;andM;LAN TOOLS LAGandM;Even fewer tools are directed toward local-area network users--a result ofthe relatively recent ascent of LANs in many organizations.andP;  For smallerLANs, the need to model the network is not even an issue.andP;  &quot;Most people arenot using the full bandwidth of their networks,&quot; said Erwin of dwbAssociates.andP;  &quot;Adding another server or more users is not a problem.&quot;andM;However, large organizations with complex LANs comprising many hundreds orthousands of nodes and multiple LANs tied together confront the loadingproblems that network modeling can help solve.andP;  Still, users are skepticaldespite the burgeoning size of their networks.andM;&quot;The need for connectivity doesn't stop,&quot; said Cheryl Currid, director ofapplied information technology at Coca-Cola Foods, Houston.andP;  &quot;Ninety-sixpercent of our computers are attached to LANs.andP;  Now, we're going from the LANand expanding out to pushing packets over long-distance wires.&quot;andM;The network, a mix of PCs and Unix-based machines, encompasses thousands ofusers nationwide.andP;  The multiple LANs are attached to one another, and are inturn linked to the IBM mainframe WAN.andM;&quot;We didn't use any modeling tools for building our system.andP;  We built it onepiece at a time,&quot; Currid said.andP;  &quot;A modeler might pull some efficiencies out,but why go through the effort for marginal gains?andP;  The cost of retooling istoo great,&quot; she said.andM;A small department of LAN administrators regularly monitors the network.andP;  &quot;Onthe local side, we very infrequently exceed bandwidth capacity.andP;  However, wehave exceeded the number of devices and not missed a beat.andP;  There was noperceptible difference in response time.andP;  Users didn't know, even though wewere way out of spec.&quot;andM;Nevertheless, Currid said she might be interested in a modeling tool.andP;  &quot;Willthe network someday just stop?andP;  I believe in keeping an eye open for newideas.&quot;andM;The Industrial Technology Institute in Ann Arbor, Mich., an outfit that doesresearch and development for OSI networks, has come up with one of those newideas.andP;  ITI maintains close ties with large manufacturers, developingtechnologies with seed money they provide.andP;  ITI then turns the technologyover to a vendor to commercialize.andM;&quot;LANs are most of what we work on.andP;  There's not enough understanding ofnetwork management and why you need it,&quot; said research scientist CeliaJoseph.andM;The Institute recently developed Metasan, a Unix-based network modeling tool(Figure 1).andP;  &quot;Metasan is applicable to any type of network function and couldalso be generalized to a WAN,&quot; Joseph said, even though the protocols andproblems encountered will differ.andM;Metasan is unusual in that it uses neither queuing theory nor simulation tomodel networks.andP;  Rather, it enables users to construct models based onstochastic activity networks (SANse, which are used for reliability analysis.andO;SANs are an extension of Petri nets, which permit the representation oftimeliness (realtime requirements, fault tolerance, degradable performanceand parallelism in a single model.andM;&quot;Most queuing models assume everything works right,&quot; Joseph said.andO;&quot;Stochastic models can see the real world, where things break.&quot;andP;  According toJoseph, this is because stochastic models include failure rates.andM;Models developed with Metasan consist of descriptions of network structureand desired performance and solution options to be used in the evaluationprocess.andM;Another vendor, CACI Products Co., La Jolla, Calif., sells several networksimulation tools.andP;  &quot;Models benefit users by reducing their risk,&quot; said PaulGorman, director of sales for the communications group at CACI.andP;  &quot;Modelinggives them a way to think through the system before going to the time,trouble and expense of building the network.&quot;andM;CACI's flagship product, Network II.5, was repackaged last year with a newuser interface to focus on local-area networks.andP;  Dubbed Lannet II.5, it canbe used as a standalone tool to predict LAN performance or as an interface toNetwork II.5.andM;&quot;You can do a quick and dirty model on Lannet and use Network for moredetail,&quot; Gorman said.andP;  Ethernet, token bus, and token-ring protocols arebuilt into the product.andM;ANIMATING THE LANandM;Lannet II.5 displays an animation of the proposed LAN, showing systembottlenecks and changing levels of utilization.andP;  It also produces reportsshowing utilization, throughput and message loss.andM;For modeling wide-area voice and data networks, the vendor also offers ComnetII.5.andP;  All CACI's products are written in the company's Sanscript language.andO;A version is available for virtually any hardware platform.andM;Internetix of Upper Marlboro, Md., offers two network modeling products forLANs, Lansim and SoftBench (Figure 2).andP;  Lansim models the major LANprotocols, including Ethernet, token bus, token ring, FDDI, TCP/IP andothers, through the transport layer (layer 4) of the OSI model.andM;&quot;Lansim is a bottom-up simulation, a detailed model of traffic flows,&quot; saidAndrew Jazwinski, president and CEO of Internetix.andP;  &quot;SoftBench is ananalytical model that lets you compute throughput and delays.andP;  It includespacket and message size, but it can't model actual traffic.andP;  You might useSoftBench first for planning, then, once you've looked at the fundamentaltrade-offs, use the simulator.&quot;andM;Both products are PC-based.andP;  SoftBench runs on 286 PCs and up.andP;  Lansim needsa 386 machine with a 387 coprocessor.andM;J.L.andP;  Smith, member of the senior technical staff at the Pascagoula,Miss.-based Litton Data Systems division of Litton Industries, is usingLansim to help create a proposal for LANs for naval vessels.andM;&quot;We recognized that we needed some simulation.andP;  We need to know if thenetwork equipment we've proposed will do what the customer needs it to do,&quot;Smith explained.andP;  &quot;We use the simulation to see if we have to take correctiveaction.&quot;andM;Litton has been using Lansim for just a few months.andP;  &quot;In the past, thenetworks we proposed were so simple, the answers were obvious,&quot; Smith said,&quot;but this is a new field.&quot;andP;  They're developing fiber-optic networks for theships, and want to be able to exploit the fiber.andP;  &quot;This takes a lot of therisk out of venturing into a new business area.&quot;andM;Comdisco Systems, Inc., Foster City, Calif., offers Bones (Block-OrientedNetwork Simulator).andP;  Using a hierarchical building-block approach, Bonesprovides a graphical environment for describing and simulating communicationsnetworks.andP;  It includes a user-extendable model library and analysis tools.andM;&quot;Users want the latest and greatest technologies on their desks, but theyhave no idea how they will plug and play together.andP;  Before getting to thatpoint, we say, simulate it and save a lot of money,&quot; said Tomm Sanford,director of network consulting.andM;Bones, running on Sun-3 and Sun-4 workstations, starts at the bottom withcommunications links and network control structures to build the networksimulation.andP;  &quot;The hard part is building the simulator and collectingstatistical traffic,&quot; Sanford said.andP;  &quot;Then, take your traffic and run itthrough the simulator to get an idea of where bottlenecks would be.andP;  Then gointo a 'what-if' scenario: What do various variables do to my traffic?&quot;andM;Bones can be used in conjunction with other analyzers and systemadministration tools.andP;  &quot;You can automatically add new systems to thesimulation and have an updated map of the network,&quot; Sanford said.andP;  &quot;You canmove workstations and applications around to be more efficient.&quot;andM;Racotek Corp., Minneapolis, used Bones to model a data network on top of atrunked radio system for voice.andP;  The network allows communications betweenmobile units and communications controllers, explained Dr. Isaac Shpancer,director of research at Racotek.andM;&quot;The model we developed is very accurate, and we were able to develop it in afew weeks,&quot; Shpancer said.andP;  &quot;By conventional methods, it would have taken acouple of months to half a year.&quot;andM;Racotek used Bones to verify protocols and relay times, as well as parameterslike network congestion and billing schemes, Shpancer said.andP;  In the future,the company plans to use Bones to model a multisite radio system.andP;  Thecompany is also working with a large radio manufacturer to model its radionetwork.andM;SORTING OUT THE ISSUESandM;It is clear that as networks of all kinds become more widespread andincreasingly complex, more expertise will be necessary to manage them.andO;Network modeling tools can help.andM;&quot;Users need tools to sort out the issues.andP;  Networks are now being used forcomputing rather than simply a wire to transmit data,&quot; said Internetix'sJazwinski.andP;  &quot;If the network is 20% loaded, you don't need a tool.andP;  If it's40% to 60% loaded, then you're starting to have serious problems.andP;  Intuitionwon't help you.andP;  You have to plan.&quot;andM;Francett is a freelance writer based in Bloomfield, N.J.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
