The tests, designed to determine whether the engines' fan disks contain imperfections, will very likely cost the airlines a total of &quot;$10 million or more,&quot; according to Anthony Broderick, the FAA's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance. Most affected would be United, a unit of UAL Corp., which has 141 of these engines, and American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., which has 147 such engines.    Other U.S. and foreign airlines have an additional 199 of the engines, which includes spares.    Only the engines on DC-10-10s, the kind of aircraft that crashed in Iowa July 19, will have to be tested. There are three CF6-6 engines made by General Electric Co. of Fairfield, Conn., on each DC-10-10, which is made by McDonnell Douglas Corp. In the Iowa accident, the tail engine blew apart, apparently severing the plane's hydraulic lines, which control most major plane movements. After struggling to control the plane, the pilots crashed into a cornfield while attempting an emergency landing. One hundred eleven people were killed.    A spokesman for GE, the giant electrical products, financial services and broadcasting concern, said, &quot;It is premature to comment.&quot;    Safety investigators suspect the engine broke up after the fan disk, a 300-pound hunk of titanium that holds the fan blades, failed. Such a disk failure could have been caused by imperfections or cracks in the titanium. But federal officials can't be sure because they haven't been able to find the disk pieces among the tall corn.    But in extensive testing of engine disks made from the same titanium ingot as the one on the United plane, GE and FAA engineers have found a tiny crack in one of the disks. Mr. Broderick said he doesn't know whether the crack relates to the accident, but added that it is so small, it probably doesn't have safety significance.    In any case, the FAA is planning to require airlines to test all DC-10-10 engines, using the latest technology. However, the plans could change if the agency uncovers information that calls for a different course of action.    Under the expected order, which will probably be issued this month, the airlines would have to remove the engines from the aircraft, take them apart, and put the three-foot-wide disks into a water chamber where they would be bombarded with ultrasonic waves. A computer would then analyze whether there are any &quot;echoes&quot; and what they mean.    The testing, besides being expensive, could be disruptive for the airlines. The FAA estimates it will take 40 hours to test each disk. </TEXT></DOC>
