Why we didn't is a questionpeople are reviewing throughout the NORAD system right now,&quot; Niemann said.;   The Defense Department referred questions to NORAD.;    NORAD has notdetermined if radar picked up the MiG at any point during its flight, Niemannsaid, but he said it might have taken as little as eight to 10 minutes to flythe 90 miles from Cuba to Key West.;    If the plane came in at only a fewfeet above the sea level, Navy aerostat balloons and other radar equipmentcould have been confused by choppy waves, according to military experts.;   Lt.
