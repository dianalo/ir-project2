In over-the-counter trading, Waldbaum Class A shares were quoted at $49 bid. The acquisition has an indicated value of $287.1 million based on Waldbaum's 5,743,000 common shares outstanding, which include Class A and Class B shares.    Montvale, N.J.-based Aandamp;P, an acquisition-hungry supermarket chain with 1,100 stores in 25 states and Canada, had said the partnership on Wednesday purchased all the 3,142,000 Waldbaum Class B shares. Those shares were held by members of the Waldbaum family, including the founder and chief executive officer, Ira Waldbaum, who will continue running the 141-store chain.    Aandamp;P will finance the new partnership, APW Partners, in exchange for a majority interest in the venture. The partnership, which includes Mr. Waldbaum, has formed APW Supermarket Corp. to make the tender offer for Waldbaum Inc. shares. The tender offer covers both Class A and Class B shares.    The company's common stock last year was redesignated Class A, and Class B shares with 10 times the voting power but a lower dividend were created as an anti-takeover measure and to ensure Waldbaum family control of the company. The Waldbaum family's Class B shares purchased Wednesday were a controlling interest.    The Waldbaum acquisition likely will strengthen Aandamp;P's presence in the Northeast. Waldbaum's stores are in New York City, Long Island and Westchester County in New York, as well as Massachusetts and Connecticut. Aandamp;P has been on the prowl for acquisitions this year; in the summer it acquired 91.5% of the shares of Shopwell Inc., with 53 supermarkets in the New York area, and last month was spurned by Delchamps Inc. after offering $160 million for that Mobile, Ala.-based supermarket chain. </TEXT></DOC>
