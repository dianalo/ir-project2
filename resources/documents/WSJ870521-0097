But Novato, Calif.-based Fireman's Fund said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it didn't intend to take over Alexander.    Fireman's Fund, an insurer which is 27%-owned by New York-based American Express Co., said the stake is &quot;for the purpose of investment in the ordinary course of business and not for the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control&quot; of the company.    &quot;I tend to believe them,&quot; said Gerald Lewinsohn, who follows Fireman's Fund for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.    Alexander, the world's second largest insurance broker, said in a statement that it &quot;intends to carefully monitor Fireman's Fund's activities in the Aandamp;A shares.&quot;    Alexander's shares jumped $3 a share to close at $25.50 in composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange. American Express shares rose $1.375 to close at $32 on the Big Board, and Fireman's Fund shares rose 87.5 cents to close at $34.875.    In its filing, Fireman's Fund said it owns 3,834,900 Alexander common shares, including 1,954,700 shares purchased from April 13 through May 13 at $23.47 to $28.07 a share.    Fireman's Fund owns 10.9% of Alexander's approximate 35.2 million common shares. However, Alexander also has about 4.8 million Class A common shares owned by Canadian holders, and about 1.5 million Class C shares, owned by shareholders in the United Kingdom. Both classes, which were established for tax reasons, carry voting and economic rights equal to the common shares, making Fireman's Fund's total voting stake 9.2%.    Fireman's Fund said it is seeking clearance from federal regulators to boost its holding to more than 15% of the common shares. Fireman's Fund said it intends to purchase additional common shares &quot;in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.&quot; It hasn't decided how many shares it will acquire, the SEC filing said.    A Fireman's Fund spokeswoman said the Alexander investment is consistent with the firm's investment strategy. The firm's investment experts &quot;buy large blocks of stock when they decide to go for something,&quot; she said.    Mr. Lewinsohn, the analyst, said that while Merrill Lynch hasn't been bullish on Alexander in the short term, it believes the stock over a period of a few years could turn out to be a &quot;cheap&quot; buy for Fireman's Fund.    Still, one source close to the situation noted that this investment is &quot;much closer to home&quot; for Fireman's Fund than its previous passive investments, indicating that Fireman's Fund could opt to seek to acquire Alexander at some time in the future.    Joan Zief, a Merrill Lynch analyst who follows Alexander, added that &quot;I'm not sure this is the right time&quot; for someone to want to take over Alexander. She said the firm has had a problem controlling costs during periods when premium growth has slowed revenue.    She also noted that the company has been plagued by litigation problems stemming from its acquisition of a British insurance broker, Alexander Howden Group, in 1982. Alexander bought the Howden firm in 1982 for $300 million, but found problems in the company that led to a $40 million charge and a string of lawsuits.    An Alexander spokesman declined to comment.    In 1986, Alexander earned $43.2 million, or $1.05 a share, after a loss of $7.3 million in 1985. The 1986 results included a loss of $24 million from discontinued operations, while the 1985 period included a loss of $52 million from discontinued operations. </TEXT></DOC>
