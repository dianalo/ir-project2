Thus, radiographic imaging techniques are essentialin helping to make appropriate treatment decisions. Although nonspecific,the chest radiograph is useful to augment interpretation of the radionuclideventilation perfusion (V/Q) scan and to identify other abnormalitieswhich may account for the patient's symptoms. In comparisions of pulmonaryperfusion and ventilation radionuclide images, regions of mismatch areidentified and correlated with the chest radiograph. The number and sizeof these mismatched regions allow a classification ranging from normalto high probability of pulmonary embolus. Unfortunately, a majority ofpatients will have a combination of scintigraphic and radiographic findingswhich fall into the moderate probability or indeterminate categories.In order to increase diagnostic certainty in these patients, as wellas in patients in whom the results of the V/Q scan are not consistentwith the clinical suspicion, or in those with a high-probability scanbut in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated, pulmonary arteriographymay be necessary. This should be performed with selective injectionsinto the region of the highest probability as judged from the V/Q scan.Careful technique and pulmonary artery pressure measurements will minimizecomplications from this invasive procedure. Correlation of angiographicfindings with V/Q scans and a protocol for examining these patients arepresented.</TEXT></DOC>
