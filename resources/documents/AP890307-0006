Local military and civilian officials say this town of 12,000people that is 230 miles north of Manila became a rebel strongholdafter the former president fled to Hawaii in the 1986military-civilian uprising that propelled Corazon Aquino to power.   ``In the time of Marcos, they were only in the mountains,'' MayorFelicito Tamayo said of the rebel New People's Army. ``Now they havebeen able to reverse that. It's as if the timing was great _Communists entering and Marcos leaving.''   Marcos town is about 10 miles south of Sarrat, where the formerpresident was born 71 years ago. The town's 13 outlying hamlets,most named for members of Marcos' family, have become gateways forguerrillas to slip down from the mountains into populous areas ofIlocos Norte province.   ``They just pass through,'' said Melecio Duldulao, 45, chief ofthe hamlet of Imelda, named for Marcos' wife. ``Occasionally, whenthey come at lunchtime, we ask them to join us. But that's all.''   Tamayo said the rebels have killed civilians, seized privateproperty for their ``revolutionary agrarian reform'' and have forcedbusinesses to pay protection money, or what they call``revolutionary taxes.''   On March 1, army troops raided a 14-acre rebel training camp lessthan two miles from the town. The camp, which was abandoned,contained obstacle courses and a makeshift clinic.   Tamayo said the rebel activity has created a climate of fear inthe town which civilian and military officials appear powerless tostop.   ``By 6 p.m., you should have already eaten and gone home,''Tamayo said. ``Then make sure all the windows are closed.''   Townspeople say they try to remain neutral in the conflict butfind themselves increasingly drawn into the cycle of violence.   ``Cory arrived and the New People's Army arrived,'' said HelenAbrigado, wife of a town official. ``We are really having a hardtime. We are afraid. If we see the (rebels), we get scared. When wesee the military we also get scared.''   Duldulao said the rebels began infilrating his hamlet, about amile east of the town center, in 1984. Four years later, they killedArtemio Manguma, leader of the village security volunteers and asuspected military informant, he said.   Several months later, rebels tied up Duldulao in front of hiseight children but released him after his wife, Milagros, convincedthem he had no links to the military.   ``They have organized in the (village) level,'' said Brig. Gen.Bayani Fabic, northern Luzon commander. ``They have organizedeconomic committees and are already collecting taxes.''   The army's 45th Infantry Battalion operates in the area, andFabic has stepped up intelligence-gathering operations against theshadow governments, which he considers the principal threat.   ``To us, the armed component is easy to control,'' Fabic said,referring to armed guerrillas. ``But to uproot the politicalstructure of the shadow government, that is a very tedious process.''   Rev. Rock Bonoan, a spokesman for Roman Catholic archdiocese,said the church plays a leading role in mediating between themilitary and the rebels. He said priests often must defendparishioners accused by the military of sympathizing with therebels, whose insurgency is 20 years old.   ``Most of them are victims in this war,'' Bonoan said. ``Peopleare branded Communist rebels even before they become one.''   Last May, gunmen who Bonoan said were believed to be soldiersmassacred a family of five in the nearby town of Vintar. No one wasarrested, he said.   ``That has added to the people's dissatisfaction anddemoralization with the government,'' Bonoan said. ``They have lostconfidence in the government.''</TEXT></DOC>
