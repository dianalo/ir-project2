This was, in part, due to very unusual location and symptomatology,lack of a primary site, and the unusual age of presentation. It was onlyafter other metastatic bone lesions were detected and biopsied that thediagnosis of neuroblastoma could be made. A discussion is presented regardingthe staging, prognosis, and current imaging modalities used to diagnoseneuroblastoma.</TEXT></DOC>
