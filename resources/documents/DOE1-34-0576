The ATLAS superconductinglinac consists of an independent-phased array of 45 superconducting niobiumresonators of the split-ring type. The linac has been operating in itspresent form since 1985, on a 24-hours per day, 5 days per week schedule.An upgrade of the ATLAS system is currently under construction the positive-ioninjector (PII). The PII system will consist of an ECR positive-ion sourcemounted on a high-voltage platform injecting a very-low-velocity superconductinglinac. The completed system will provide for the acceleration of beamsof mass up to uranium, and will replace the tandem electrostatic acceleratoras the injector for ATLAS. The status of resonator development for thesuperconducting linac is reported in this paper. Accelerating gradientsin the existing ATLAS linac are currently limited by excessive heatingand rf loss in the fast-tuning system associated with each superconductingresonator. Development of an upgraded fast-tuning system is also reportedhere. 7 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
