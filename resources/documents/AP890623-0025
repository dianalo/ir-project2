RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court struck a blow againstorganized crime and drug dealers by letting the government seizeassets which defendants wish to use to pay their lawyers, thenation's chief law enforcement officer says.   But attorneys groups said a pair of high court rulings Thursdayundermines the nation's system of justice _ tipping the balanceunfairly in favor of prosecutors.   The court, in two 5-4 decisions, upheld the constitutionality offederal laws that permit the confiscation of money and property frompeople accused of crimes _ even if it means they cannot afford alawyer.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the rulings are ``a notablevictory in the government's war on drugs. As the court put it,Congress did not write this law to rewrite the old adage that `crimedoes not pay' to read `crime does not pay except for attorneys'fees.'''   But Scott Wallace of the National Association of Criminal DefenseLawyers said, ``We see these cases as a national tragedy. TheClarence Darrows of today and tomorrow are going to go into someother area of the law.''   American Bar Association President Robert Raven, head of thenation's largest lawyers' organization, said, ``The Supreme Court'sdecisions today seriously weaken our criminal justice adversarialsystem and impede a person's basic right to retain counsel of his orher choice.''   He said the ABA will ask Congress to amend federal law to shieldlegal fees from confiscation.   As it sped toward the expected end of its 1988-89 term next week,the court also:   _Narrowed a century-old federal law by giving cities importantnew protection against big-money damage awards when they are accusedof violating people's civil rights.   In the latest in a string of setbacks for civil rights activists,the court said an 1866 law may be used to sue a city only if it canbe proved the alleged civil rights violation was part of an officialmunicipal policy. The court ruled against a former Dallas highschool football coach who said he lost his job because he is white.   _Ruled 6-3 in a free-speech case from New York City thatcommunities may impose regulations aimed at keeping down the volumeat rock concerts.   _Upheld a $200,000 libel award against Harte-HanksCommunications, but the decision did not appear to weakensignificantly the news media's protections against such lawsuits.   In the legal fee cases from Virginia and New York, the court saidthe rights to due process and a lawyer's help are not violated whenthe direct or indirect proceeds of allegedly illicit activities areconfiscated.   At issue were forfeiture provisions of key federal crime-fightinglaws, the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Act and the RacketeerInfluenced Corrupt Organizations law.   The rulings also left states free to enact or enforce similarlaws.   The decisions said a criminal defendant's assets may be frozenbefore trial if there is probable cause to believe they wereobtained illegally. Defendants who are acquitted may keep or recovertheir assets.   In one case, a law firm was denied $170,000 in legal fees forrepresenting Christopher Reckmeyer in 1985. He pleaded guilty inVirginia to charges stemming from what prosecutors said was his roleas kingpin of a multimillion-dollar drug operation.   Reckmeyer was sentenced to 17 years in prison and ordered toforfeit all proceeds from the drug deals. That included a parcel ofland the government sold for $5.3 million. The seizure of his moneyleft him without funds to pay the law firm.   In the second case, the government appealed a ruling that wouldhave allowed Peter Monsanto access to assets worth $400,000 to helphim pay his lawyers.   Monsanto was convicted in New York City of charges he headed aheroin-selling ring.   The jury had ordered Monsanto to forfeit to the government ahouse in Mount Vernon, N.Y., valued at $335,000, a $30,000 apartmentin the Bronx and $35,000 in cash. But a federal appeals court saidMonsanto could use the assets to pay his lawyers.</TEXT></DOC>
