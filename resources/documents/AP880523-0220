Each state's water lawvaries, but generally the people have access to all of America'snavigable streams, unlike in England where almost all sports watersare privately owned.   ``Fishing regulations are still evolving from colonial times,when we rejected the English ways but created a vacuum,'' said PaulSchullery, an associate editor of Country Journal in Harrisburg, Pa.   ``Over the years the laws have become enormously tangled. Thecatch and release philosophy only started about 50 years ago. Thehatchery approach is increasingly under fire, especially by flyfishermen who put a higher aesthetic value on wild trout.''   Until the Civil War, America's rivers and streams were chockfull of wild fish.   ``A guy could take home a hundred trout from one day's fishing,go back and do it again the next day, and nobody noticed,'' saidSchullery. ``After the war there was an explosion in recreation andtravel with expansion of the railroads. The country grew up, andgrowing access to the nation's waters began emptying the streams offish.   ``People realized they had to do something about it and thenatural course was to begin stocking them with hatchery supplies.In a lot of places there would have been no fish left withouthatchery fish, but now it's a big bureaucracy.''   Hard-core fly fishermen disdain hatchery-raised trout, claimingthat only wild ones are tough fighters with pretty rainbow-coloredscales and have a firm texture and pink tint to their flesh.Besides, they say, fish raised on hatchery chow taste mushy.   Defenders counter that without the government's extensivestocking efforts, thousands of anglers would never experience thethrill of landing a fish at all.   Many New England states, as well as New York and Pennsylvania,have long supported sports fisheries with public money, a financialcommitment that migrated slowly westward with the population.   Since 1950, federal money also has been earmarked to improve andmaintain fish habitats, upgrade fishing and boating access andconduct research.   In 1984, the Wallop-Breaux Fund, named after Sen. MalcolmWallop, R-Wyo., and Rep. John B. Breaux, D-La., who introduced themeasure in Congress, quadrupled the amount returning to the states.   The money comes from taxes on tackle, motors, boat fuel andimport duties on sports fishing equipment and pleasure craft.   This year Washington will give back through state fish and gamedepartments more than $155 million in user fees to improve hobbyfishing. The funds are distributed on the basis of land and waterarea and the number of fishing licenses issued by each state.   The 1986 Department of the Interior survey indicated 6.4 millionAmericans were fly fishermen. John D. Randolph, editor of FlyFisherman magazine, estimates 500,000 of those are hard-coreanglers, with another million described as ``serious.'' The restare presumed to play at it.   Trout Unlimited has 450 U.S. chapters and is affiliated withgroups in Canada, Japan, France, New Zealand and the Soviet Union.Its stated mission is to ``protect and enhance the cold-waterfishery of North America.''   In the past four years it has spent $700,000 on 135 projects toimprove fish habitat and water conservation. The``Embrace-A-Stream'' program, which aims to get local communitiesinvolved in improving their own natural resources, has been hailedas innovative and effective.   But lately TU has been casting its organizational net fartherafield.   Last year it signed two agreements with the Union of Hunting andFishing, a 2.7 million-member group which controls 85 percent ofall land and water resources in the Soviet Union. TU said theagreements call for exchanging research and management programs,technical assistance and sportsmen.   TU reports the Soviets and Americans are working out details toallow U.S. anglers to fish for arctic char in Siberian waters andvisit rivers running into the Caspian Sea, where 40-pound browntrout lie in wait.   In 1987, a small Soviet delegation fished Colorado waters. Unionchief Alexander Ulitin said:   ``We should put Reagan and Gorbachev together in a bass boat andspread the papers out on the bottom. Then things would be better.''   For as President Herbert Hoover once said:   ``Fishing ... brings meekness and inspiration, reduces ouregotism, soothes our troubles and shames our wickedness. It isdiscipline in the equality of men _ for all men are equal beforefish.''</TEXT><HEAD>Next: Jet Set Fly Fishing</HEAD><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE></DOC>
