It leads to a method which is linear in space complexityand NlogN in expected time complexity. The implementation is straightforwardand can therefore be used to handle large sequences with relative ease.Of particular interest is that several sequences can be treated as asingle sequence. This leads to an efficient method for finding dyadsand for finding common features of many sequences, such as favorablealignments.</TEXT></DOC>
