The Federal Emergency Management Agency has responsibilityfor ensuring the adequacy of offsite emergency plans at nuclear powerplants and has periodically conducted surveys to determine whether emergencyplanning zones residents have received basic emergency planning information.However, FEMA has not assessed whether the public actually knows whatto do in the event of an emergency. GAO believes it is appropriate thatFEMA do this. This report provides information concerning the actionsthat utilities and FEMA take to notify EPZ residents of the proceduresto be followed if a nuclear accident occurs.
