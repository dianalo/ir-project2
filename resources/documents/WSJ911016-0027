The quarter's pace of downgrades -- 3.2 for every upgrade-- was below last year's average pace of 4.4, the highestsince World War II, Moody's said. But it's still double therate in 1983, the first year of the last recovery, theratings agency said. The record for downgrades was set in the1990 fourth quarter, when the ratio was 6.3 to 1.</LP><TEXT>   In this year's third quarter, the ratings of 96 U.S.companies were lowered, affecting $57 billion of debt, whilethose of 36 corporations were increased, affecting $14billion.   But John Lonski, senior economist for Moody's, warned that&quot;a decided improvement in credit quality has not yet beenestablished.&quot; Nevertheless, he predicted credit qualityeventually will be enhanced as companies reduce the debt ontheir balance sheets and &quot;lenders remain significantly morerisk-averse than they were in the 1980s.&quot;   Among industrial companies, the ratio of downgrades toupgrades fell to 2.2 to 1 from 5.6 to 1 last year. Utilities,meanwhile, saw eight downgrades to three upgrades.   Mr. Lonski said the greatest shift was seen amongcompanies with speculative-grade ratings, a category that hadseen an avalanche of downgrades in the past. The 2.5-to-1ratio is a sharp improvement from the preceding threequarters, Moody's said, when downgrades led upgrades morethan 6 to 1.</TEXT></DOC>
