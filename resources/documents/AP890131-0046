The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which had lost64.05 points at the end of the morning session, closed 13.80 points,or 0.04 percent, higher at 31,581.30.

The currency opened at 129.59 yen andmoved between 129.05 yen and 129.63 yen.   The dollar's lower opening in Tokyo followed a decline in NewYork Monday when traders who had bought dollars Friday sold forprofit taking, dealers said. The dollar closed at 129.30 yen in NewYork Monday, down from last Friday's finish of 129.43 yen.   ``In Tokyo, market players were not making any major moves exceptfor some position adjustments, and many of them remained on thesidelines trying to determine the future of the dollar-yen rate,''said Minori Takeuchi of the Chemical Bank.   However, she said, the currency's slight loss Tuesday morning didnot signal a reversal in the trend toward a stronger dollar. Tradingwas also thin because of the lack of market-affecting news, Ms.Takeuchi said.   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei index, the market's mainbarometer, opened lower despite gains in the Dow Jones industrialaverage in New York.   Traders said institutional investors were cautious due tofluctuations in the dollar-yen rate on foreign exchange markets.   Trading was directionless in the absence of majormarket-affecting incentives, said one trader with a major securitiesfirm in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
