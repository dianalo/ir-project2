Administration officials dismiss West European warnings of bold Soviet proposals on conventional weaponry or tactical nuclear weapons, but worry that the U.S. will be ill-prepared if they come. &quot;We can't get the administration and the allies together enough to come up with our own initiative,&quot; one official complains.    State officials press hard for progress on a strategic-arms pact, but the Joint Chiefs campaign to slow things down, fearing a hasty deal could undermine the U.S. strategic position. The Strategic Defense Initiative and mobile missiles remain major issues, as do sea-launched cruise missiles; the U.S., which has a clear advantage in SLCMs, doesn't want to include them.    &quot;It's easier to be flexible on what we don't have -- mobiles and SDI -- than weapons we have, like and don't want to give up,&quot; says a Shultz adviser.    REPUBLICANS STRUGGLE to recoup from damage after the trade-bill veto.    Their push for a revised bill stripped of the plant-closing provision has little chance. While Democratic chairmen Rostenkowski and Bentsen favor such a move, Wright and Byrd drag their feet to preserve the veto as a campaign issue. Democrats consider a plan to pass a separate plant-closing bill they'd deliver to Reagan around Labor Day, prompting another embarrassing veto.    Sen. Quayle's bill for voluntary plant-closing notification attracts many Republicans but won't pass. &quot;This is just a way to fill in the political vacuum,&quot; acknowledges GOP Rep. Madigan. Hoping to blunt charges of being anti-worker, Senate Republicans try to talk up more job-search aid for displaced employees.    BUSH MOVES to address the GOP gender gap but faces big obstacles.    His poor poll standing is due largely to the party's weakness among women; GOP pollster Wirthlin shows Republican strength among women runs 20 points lower than among men. Bush adds two women aides to address women's issues and plans a big push on child care, stressing a menu of choices for parents while attacking Democrats for pushing big-government solutions.    But the right wing warns Bush not to go too far on child care, and he faces credibility problems. He has no women in his inner circle, while Dukakis has not only campaign manager Estrich but also a number of others, including his top foreign-policy aide and his convention manager.    GOP Rep. Marge Roukema meets on women's issues with Bush's senior aides but laments that they &quot;were not very responsive.&quot;    DEMOCRATS WORRY that Speaker Wright's problems could neutralize the ethics issue this fall, as Bush and the GOP start to hammer at him in hopes of deflecting attention from Meese. Despite House Democrats' public backing of Wright, one Democrat with ties to him acknowledges that &quot;the speaker has become a serious embarrassment.&quot;    BUSH SURROGATES will step up Dukakis-bashing as the Massachusetts governor nears the Democratic nomination. They'll target his opposition to capital punishment and stand on drug sentencing, as well as national-security issues. Governors such as Sununu of neighboring New Hampshire will play a large role. &quot;You always use those who know him best,&quot; he says.    SILVER LINING: Despite Dukakis's big national edge in the polls, Bush continues to hold steady leads in most Southern states. A survey in South Carolina gives the vice president a 12-point edge there. Bush strategists say a solid Southern base enables the campaign to focus its resources elsewhere and makes a comeback easier.    REPUBLICANS BRISTLE at a new Dukakis national-security aide: Graham Allison, dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and a former close adviser to Caspar Weinberger at the Pentagon. The Republicans regard Allison as a turncoat and grumble that he is angling for a senior job such as national-security adviser.    TAKING STOCK: The White House response to the crash draws sharp criticism.    Wary of another crash that could open them up to charges of inaction, Senate Republicans take aim at the presidential working group on market reform. &quot;It troubles me that so many good people can come up with so little,&quot; says Heinz; D'Amato chides: &quot;We'd be darn fools to say all is well.&quot;    The lawmakers hoped the group would at least provide the appearance of addressing small investors' concerns. But insiders say its form, which requires a consensus among the heads of the SEC, CFTC, Fed and Treasury, makes agreement on tough issues all but impossible. SEC Chairman Ruder dissents on several major points, and CFTC Chairman Gramm on others.    Administration free-marketeers privately criticize New York Stock Exchange trading structures as archaic but aren't willing to take on the Big Board publicly in an election year.    MINOR MEMOS: Texas Sen. Gramm, who last year bitterly attacked federal financing of a weed center in North Dakota, pushes to establish a &quot;plant stress&quot; lab in Lubbock. . . . Oliver North will be the main attraction at a fund-raiser next week for a GOP House candidate in Orange County, Calif. . . . Newsmakers? In the middle of Wednesday's Dukakis-Jackson debate, journalistic panelists managed to slip in a plug for the book one of them wrote. </TEXT></DOC>
