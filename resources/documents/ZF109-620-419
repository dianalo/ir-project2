(a phonetic text-retrieval algorithmbetter than Soundex) (tutorial)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Philips, Lawrence.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Soundex is the most popular algorithm used for data bases whenusers need to be able to search on a name even if they are unsureof its spelling.andP;  The program attempts to retrieve names thatsound like the one a user enters.andP;  Soundex maps groups ofconsonants to single digits.andP;  It saves the first letter andeliminates any vowels after the first letter.andP;  Soundex, however,returns some choices that sound nothing like what is entered andsometimes does not locate names that sound similar such as Stephenand Steven.andP;  There is also no reason to map sets of letters tonumbers.andP;  The Metaphone algorithm constructs a phoneticized andcoded spelling.andP;  It also ignores vowels after the first letter buttries to apply common English pronunciation rules.andP;  Zero is usedto represent the 'th' sound and the letter X is used for the 'sh'sound.andP;  Usually only the first four letters of phonetic spellingsare used.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     AlgorithmsData BasesSearch StrategyPhoneticsType-In ProgramsTutorial.andO;Feature:   illustrationtableprogram.andO;Caption:   The 16 consonant sounds, exceptions and transformations.
