Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CMAFC FDS </CO><IN> TNM RET RFD </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Robert Campeau said Ralphs Grocery Co. management will have an &quot;equity participation&quot; in the unit following Campeau Corp.'s $6.6 billion acquisition of the supermarket chain's parent, Federated Department Stores Inc.    Mr. Campeau, chairman and chief executive officer of Campeau, said the company would &quot;create a financial structure with the cooperation of Ralphs' management. We remain committed to continuing Ralphs' successful performance and management style, as well as supplying ample resources for its future growth and expansion.&quot;    Since Toronto-based Campeau began trying to take over Federated, several groups reportedly emerged with offers to buy Ralphs outright, including the 129-store chain's management, and Dublin, Calif.-based Lucky Stores Inc., a competing supermarket chain that is now the target of an unsolicited takeover attempt by American Stores Co.    A spokesman for Compton, Calif.-based Ralphs said &quot;we're enthusiastic about Mr. Campeau's intent to jointly continue operating Ralphs.&quot;    Mr. Campeau didn't specify what percentage stake Ralphs management would hold in the company. Jonathan Ziegler, a supermarket analyst with Sutro andamp; Co. in San Francisco, said the stake will likely be a minority one as &quot;Ralphs management probably won't be able to put in a big chunk of equity.&quot;    Officials of Ralphs and Cincinnati-based Federated declined to elaborate on Mr. Campeau's announcement, which came after a meeting he had here with Ralphs management. But individuals close to the companies said Ralphs would likely operate as a subsidiary of Campeau with its own debt and equity, separate from the combined department-store operations of Federated and Campeau's Allied Stores Inc.    Mr. Campeau said earlier this month that he expected to raise about $1 billion for the Federated acquisition through a &quot;leveraged acquisition&quot; of Ralphs by a separate subsidiary of Campeau.    As previously reported, Campeau launched an unfriendly $47-a-share bid for Federated in January, but eventually faced a competing offer from R.H. Macy andamp; Co. After a series of sweetened offers, Campeau won earlier this month when Macy dropped out but agreed to buy Federated's I. Magnin and Bullock's operations, two West Coast department-store units, for $1.1 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
