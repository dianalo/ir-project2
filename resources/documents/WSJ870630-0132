The dividend is payable Aug. 5 to stock of record July 7.    The maker of electronic parts said the board's decision wasn't the result of any materially adverse change in business conditions or any actions taken by its banks or creditors.    David K. Sentman, treasurer of CTS, said the company has paid a 25-cent quarterly common share dividend for the past six years. But he said a recent agreement between CTS and Dynamics Corp. of America, Greenwich, Conn., gave Dynamics three seats on the seven-member CTS board. &quot;The directors believed the dividend rate was too high and that shareholders would be best served by increasing the company's cash flow,&quot; Mr. Sentman said. He said the board's decision was unanimous.    Dynamics, which makes electronic parts and air conditioning equipment, was unsuccessful earlier this year in its efforts to take over CTS. Mr. Sentman said the dividend reduction wasn't related to the takeover attempt. </TEXT></DOC>
