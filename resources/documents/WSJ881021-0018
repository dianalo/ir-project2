In Tokyo, expectations of lower interest rates brought share prices higher in strong trading. The Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 96.88 points to 27390.55, after gaining 151.69 Wednesday. The Tokyo stock price index of all issues in the first section, which rose 9.51 Wednesday, gained another 5.73 to 2123.90. First section volume totaled about one billion shares -- passing that level for the first time since Oct. 5 -- up from about 600 million shares a day earlier.    In early trading in Tokyo on Friday, the Nikkei index jumped 191.74 points to 27582.29 in the first 15 minutes.    More investors believe the Bank of Japan's moves to ease credit will lower interest rates. This spurred the market on Thursday and kept trading strong, until late afternoon profit-taking cooled the momentum.    Clearer signs that the so-called triple merit of low interest rates, low oil prices and the low dollar will continue caused the volume to rise so high, brokers said, especially in the nonmanufacturing sector.    Investors have been hesitant to trade, because Emperor Hirohito's medical condition is casting some uncertainty on whether growth in consumer spending will continue strong. Analysts expect the Japanese to restrain themselves during the mourning period following his death.    Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone closed at a record low after the subscription price was fixed Wednesday at 1.9 million yen in the third public offering of 1.5 million of the government's NTT holdings. The shares fell 20,000 yen to 1.95 million yen ($15,311), up from an intraday low of 1.94 million yen. Subscribers may buy at the fixed price again Friday. Though volume was thin, traders said some of the selling appeared to be from investors taking advantage of the difference between the price in trading on the exchange and the price of the third tranche.    Nonmanufacturing-sector stocks, such as brokerages and real estate gained, as did oil and nonferrous metals. Steel shares remained high. Stocks in the service industry declined, influenced by the Recruit Cosmos stock trading scandal.    Among steelmakers, NKK was up 16 yen to 794 ($6.23) and Kobe Steel gained 12 to 648. Mitsui Mining andamp; Smelting rose 28 to 593, Furukawa gained 28 to 715 and Sumitomo Metal Mining rose 70 to 1,270. Among heavy industrials, Mitsui Engineering andamp; Shipbuilding rose 14 to 681.    Keihin Electric Express Railway rose 80 to 1,570 and Keio Teito Electric Railway was up 40 at 1,220.    Mitsui Real Estate rose 50 to 2,600.    Traders said focus has returned to land-asset holding issues yet again, and some saw the gains among railways and real estates as owing more to the effect of this theme than interest rates. This also pushed some construction stocks higher.    In London, share prices finished an uneven session slightly firmer, propelled by a late-afternoon rally, amid selective buying of takeover-related stocks.    The Financial Times 100-share index closed 1.8 points higher at 1864.3, also its best level for the day. The 30-share index dipped 0.7 to 1512.5. Volume was a relatively healthy 612.7 million shares, compared with 609.3 million a day earlier.    The market continued to focus on corporate news, including Lloyds Bank's agreement to take a majority stake in Abbey Life and developments in the Elders-Scottish andamp; Newcastle and Minorco-Consolidated Gold Fields takeover battles. And heavy trading in Lonrho kept market players guessing. U.K. money supply figures reported at late morning failed to influence the market much, despite their coming in at the high side of expectations.    Australia's Elders was reported to be buying Scottish andamp; Newcastle at its 400 pence ($7) bid price. The shares closed at 400.50. The Elders bid values the U.K. brewer at #1.6 billion ($2.8 billion).    Traders said the market was somewhat surprised by Lloyds Bank's agreeing to take a 57.6% stake in Abbey Life in return for Abbey's acquisition of five Lloyds financial-services businesses. The news had been foreshadowed by the suspension of trading in Abbey shares Wednesday. Lloyds surged 11.5 to 340.5, while Abbey remained suspended at 294.    Lonrho rose 5 to 379. Traders said there was suspicion that Bond Corp. of Australia continued to build on its holding. On Tuesday, Lonrho reported parties connected to Bond had acquired slightly more than a 4% stake in the British overseas trader.    Consolidated Gold Fields surged 52 to #12.72 on rumors that a friendly suitor would emerge Friday to rescue the company from hostile suitor Minorco.    In Frankfurt, share prices closed lower across the board in moderately active trading. The DAX index fell 9.16 points to close at 1295.21.    Equities tumbled in the morning on what brokers called an expected technical downward correction after the market had hit a new 1988 high Wednesday. In addition to profit-taking, brokers said, Wall Street's day-earlier loss and a weaker West German bond market contributed to the declines.    Retailer ASKO tumbled 68.50 marks to 900 ($496.35) after Deutsche Bank announced the placement of 300,000 shares from the present capital increase after major shareholders chose not to exercise their rights. The announcement, which baffled the stock market, was seen by many as a sign that ASKO's 866 million-mark share offering is in trouble.    Among other retailers, Horten eased 3 to 208 and Kaufhof slid 1.80 to 426.    Chemical issues fell. Degussa fell 4.50 to 374.50, Schering slid 4 to 561 and Bayer was off 2.40 at 308.50. BASF moved up 40 pfennigs to 281.40 marks.    Financial shares had heavy losses, following a newspaper report that the Bonn government plans to reduce tax credits given to banks for creation of loss reserves on loans to developing countries. Favorable tax treatment has allowed West German banks to build up massive loan-loss provisions. In the absence of reliable information, many investors chose to dump banking shares, but even these issues ended above their lows, brokers said. Deutsche Bank dropped 8.50 to 536.50, Bayerische Hypotheken andamp; Wechselbank lost 8 to 377, Dresdner Bank slid 7.50 to 304 and Bayerische Vereinsbank declined 7 to 378.    Stock prices closed higher in Stockholm, reversing recent declines, as takeover news and corporate earnings buoyed the market. Equities finished lower in Paris and Amsterdam, and were mixed in Zurich, Brussels and Milan. In Paris, gains of the two previous sessions eroded in moderately active trading.    In Asia, stocks closed higher in Singapore, Sydney and Seoul, were mixed in Wellington, and ended lower in Hong Kong, Taipei and Manila. Volume in Seoul surged to a record. The Sydney market climbed for the fifth consecutive session. Taipei's decline was the 18th in a row.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                   % This                         Oct 19       Oct 18       Year    U.S. ................ 255.1        257.2      + 11.1    Britain ............. 563.5        561.6      +  9.3    Canada .............. 366.4        366.8      +  4.5    Japan .............. 1272.3       1265.5      + 24.5    France .............. 404.5        398.3      + 40.2    Germany ............. 203.2        201.6      + 29.8    Hong Kong .......... 1924.3       1924.3      + 17.0    Switzerland ......... 168.1        166.9      + 19.4    Australia ........... 312.9        311.3      + 20.7    World index ......... 464.2        463.9      + 13.8</TEXT></DOC>
