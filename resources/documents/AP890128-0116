Though they smiled and chatted amiably, there was muchfinger-pointing during an unprecedented two-day meeting among livingofficials involved in the crisis, said one participant.   ``I am not sure all people have learned all the lessons from the1962 crisis,'' Theodore Sorensen, who was special counselor toPresident Kennedy, said in the session at a trade union center insouthwest Moscow.   Although he didn't name names, Sorensen said some speakers stillwere overly concerned with ``national self-interest'' and``justification,'' blaming everyone but themselves for letting thesuperpower showdown get out of hand.   ``There is plenty of blame to be shared by all countriesrepresented here today,'' said Sorensen, now a New York lawyer.   Among those around the table were former Defense Secretary RobertMcNamara and former National Security adviser McGeorge Bundy on theAmerican side.   The Soviet side included former Foreign Minister Andrei A.Gromyko and Anatoly F. Dobrynin, former ambassador to Washington.Gromyko and Dobrynin did not speak in the public session Saturdaythat ended the meeting.   For the first time, Cubans joined their superpower colleagues indiscussing the crisis. Their delegation was headed by Politburomember Jorge Risquet, who proposed another review session be held inCuba.   The focus was on October 1962, when the Soviets deployed nuclearmissiles in Cuba and the United States imposed a naval blockade onthe island and demanded and obtained the rockets' removal.   Bundy, now a New York University history professor, said theUnited States and the Soviet Union should have been more open abouttheir intentions. The Soviets have said they sent nuclear missilesto Cuba because they feared a U.S. invasion of the island. Bundysaid Washington never had any such plan and was guilty of ``a deepfailure of communication.''   ``It led you to do something we would never even think of,''placing missiles in Cuba, Bundy told the Soviets. The incidentshowed the danger of excessive secrecy in military matters, he said.   ``There are still some who think secrets are their safety. Moreoften than not, it is the other way around.''   In a plea for more openness, Scott Armstrong of aWashington-based research group that obtained declassified U.S.government documents about the Cuban missile crisis, appealed to theCubans and Soviets to release their files.   Armstrong, of the National Security Archive, pointed to threetrunk-loads of U.S. documents placed on a nearby table.   Risquet said his island had had enough of bullying by thesuperpowers and wanted opinions of small countries such as his to berespected.   Sergo Mikoyan _ who was executive secretary to his father, formerFirst Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan _ said even in disputesinvolving small countries, the superpowers should know ``it isimpossible to assume that a regional conflict will remain regional.''   Vitaly V. Zhurkin, who heads a new Soviet institute studyingEurope, said the Cuban missile crisis was unavoidable because of thesuperpowers' approach to resolving conflicts at the time. But, hesaid, the threat from both sides has been reduced because bothrecognize that nuclear weapons are not needed and that the economiesof both no longer can sustain an arms race.</TEXT></DOC>
