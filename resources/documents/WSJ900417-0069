But the chance of becoming disabled for more than threemonths is far greater than the chance of dying beforeretirement, actuaries say. Accidents, heart attacks,complicated pregnancies, cancer and even &quot;stress&quot; (which cantranslate into alcoholism and mental disorders) all taketheir toll on people's ability to carry on with their normalwork lives.   While most employers do provide short-term disabilitycoverage that pays 100% of salary, things can get tough afterit runs out in three to six months. Many employers'longer-term group disability plans are difficult to qualifyfor, pay little and limit benefit payments to only a fewyears. Social Security and state disability payments don't govery far for formerly well-paid professionals.   The answer may be supplemental coverage. &quot;It's a coveragethat's so much more needed than life insurance, but peopledon't buy it,&quot; says Michael Murray, a professor of insuranceat Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.   Though these disability contracts are costly and complex,there are ways to make the process easier, and new ways tocut costs significantly.   The first step is to take a look at your group coverage.Most plans pay 60% of base salary while the employee isdisabled. But since that doesn't include things like bonusesand profit sharing, the actual benefit may be 40% or less ofan employee's total compensation. In addition, many grouppolicies don't provide coverage for longer than two to fiveyears and don't provide for cost-of-living increases.Benefits are almost always taxable.   Many group plans also have strict definitions of&quot;disability,&quot; which would reduce the chance of qualifying.Typically, employees are considered disabled only if theycan't perform the &quot;main functions&quot; of their regularoccupations. Some plans are even stricter: After two years,they consider employees disabled only if they can't performany occupation for which they &quot;may be suited by education ortraining.&quot; The more subjective the criteria, the more controlthe employer has over payouts.   Even if your group plan seems adequate, it may make senseto look into individual policies anyway. In an environment ofmergers and buy-outs, &quot;executives who change jobs, or getsmitten with the entrepreneurial bug&quot; need individualpolicies, says Andrew Reid of Randamp;D Insurance Services in PaloAlto, Calif.   If you decide to buy supplemental coverage, start bylooking for policies that aren't cancellable and guaranteedrenewable, which means that the insurance company can't raisethe premiums or cancel the coverage. Also, look for thosethat provide coverage until age 65 or longer.   Next, choose options that tailor the policy to your needs,says Lawrence Mintzer, president of Mintzer InsuranceServices, an insurance consulting firm in Newton, Mass. Thetwo most important riders, he says, are a cost-of-livingoption, which would increase benefits with inflation, and anoption to increase coverage as income rises -- without amedical examination.   One of Mr. Mintzer's clients is a patent attorney whopurchased an individual policy with an option to increasebenefits without taking a medical exam. Soon after that, hehad back problems that required surgery. Though he wasn't outof work long enough to collect disability, his insurabilitywould have been crippled if he didn't already have thepolicy. &quot;It's unlikely that he would have been able to get anindividual policy after this,&quot; says Mr. Mintzer.   It's also a good idea to select a policy with a &quot;residualbenefit&quot; option. This pays a partial benefit that wouldsupplement your income if you could return to work, but wereunable to earn as much as you had been making before becomingdisabled.   How much supplemental coverage you need depends on severalfactors, including the other resources you have to fall backon -- things like retirement savings plans, investment incomeand income from a working spouse. Keep in mind that benefitsfrom individual disability policies will go further thanthose from company-paid plans because they are tax-free.   Insurance agents will work with you to arrive at anappropriate supplemental amount. But insurers make itdifficult to get coverage for more than 70% of one's salary,since they feel that paying more would encourage malingerers.   The first thing they look at is the benefit limit in anemployee's group policy. Consider an executive with a basesalary of $100,000 and a bonus of $50,000. Assuming her groupplan pays a maximum benefit equal to 60% of base pay, shewould receive $5,000 a month from it. In her case, an issuermight write a policy that would pay $2,440 a month, whichcombined with the group coverage would bring the totalmonthly benefit to $7,440, or 60% of the executive's totalcompensation.   Peace of mind like that doesn't come cheap, however.Fortunately, there are ways to lower premiums.   Most insurers offer discounts of 10% to 15% for people whodon't smoke. Choosing a longer period before receivingbenefits also will save money. If you're coordinatingcoverage with your group plan, you might choose to wait aslong as one to two years.   Some companies now offer &quot;adjustable-rate disabilityinsurance,&quot; which costs less than ordinary &quot;level premium&quot;policies in the early years. With adjustable-rate policies,the premium increases 8% to 10% a year until it reaches thelevel-premium rate in seven years or more. At that time, itcan be converted to a level-premium policy.   Another way to lower premiums is to get a policy from oneof the few mutual insurance companies that pay dividends ondisability insurance. (A mutual insurance company, unlike apublicly traded one that distributes dividends tostockholders, distributes its excess earnings in the form ofdividends to policy holders.)   These dividends may reduce premiums significantly.Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., Milwaukee, forexample, reduces premiums by 10% on policies that have beenheld for two years, and can make subsequent reductions of 1%a year.   Saving money also depends on not buying coverage you don'tneed. One of the most popular options is the &quot;own-occupation&quot;rider. This will pay full benefits if you can't perform yourstated occupation, but are still able to work at a related,though lower-paying job. For example, a surgeon who cannotperform surgery could work as a general practitioner andstill receive full benefits.   That sounds good, but it may not be worth the extra costfor most white-collar professionals, says Richard Kirtland,director of marketing at General American Life Insurance Co.,St. Louis. The residual rider would probably cover the lossof income, he says. The own-occupation rider is &quot;really amarketing-driven thing.&quot;   ---                How Some Policies Compare:                                                                                                          A sampling of annual premiums for disability insurancepolicies                                                                                                                            AGE 35        AGE 45       AGE 55                                                                                                                    MONTHLY INSURER     BENEFIT  (Elimination Period 1 year/90 days)*                                                                                                        Adjustable Rate Disability Policies**                                                                                                        General    $5,000  $803/1,008     $1,363/1,625 $2,517/3,228 American   $2,500  $417/519       $731/869     $1,339/1,713                                                                                                        North- western    $5,000  $939/1,123     $1,862/2,229 $3,335/4,212 Mutual     $2,500  $491/588       $953/1,143   $1,667/2,106 Level Premium Policies#                                                                                                        Paul       $5,000  $1,4871/1,874 $2,349/2,895  $3,274/4,125 Revere     $2,500  $784/966      $1,207/1,499  $1,652/2,077                                                                                                        General    $5,000  $1,254/1,578  $1,934/2,309  $2,648/3,396 American   $2,500   $892/1,077   $1,294/1,496  $1,536/1,898                                                                                                          Note: Premiums are nonsmoker's rates for policiesguarnateed renewable and noncancelable until age 65.
