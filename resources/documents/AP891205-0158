Negotiations to evacuate the guests, including about 215Americans, bogged down just as a power failure plunged the Makatishopping and commercial district into darkness.   Lt. Col. Rafael Galvez, a rebel leader, and TourismUndersecretary Rafael Alunan, the government negotiator, agreed toresume talks Wednesday.   Dempsey Pagan, an American businessman based in the Philippines,said people in nearby condominiums were running out of food. Hesaid some dashed across Ayala Avenue at great risk to buy suppliesat the only open supermarket, opposite the Intercontinental Hotel.   The rebels might be able to hold out ``forever,'' he said,because ``the government cannot really bomb this place. In order tokill the rebels, you have to bomb the whole of Makati, and theyknow the government cannot do that. They have the financial centerof the country by the neck.''   Ronald Manthey, a lawyer from Dallas, said: ``We're just trying... to figure out what we can do to get out of the financialdistrict and this hotel.   ``The rebels will not directly stop us from leaving the hotel.But the rebels have very strong armament positions around the hoteland are in constant fighting with the government forces, which havealso surrounded the entire district.''   In Washington, the Bush administration expressed concern for theAmericans and said ``some uncertainty'' remained about their status.   ``You can be assured that the Pentagon has contingency plans foreverything,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater toldreporters, but he would not say what military steps the UnitedStates might take.   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said: ``We greatlyappreciate the restraint demonstrated so far by the Philippinegovernment forces, in light of our expressions of concern about thesafety of Americans.   ``We hope that such restraint will continue on both sides, andthat agreement can be reached on arrangements to safely evacuateinnocent civilians.''   About 15 male guests were in the Intercontinental lobby whenjournalists entered with government negotiators seven hours afterthe guests were supposed to have been evacuated Tuesday morning.   About 20 journalists were driven to the hotel in an armoredvehicle captured by the rebels in fighting Sunday.   ``What nobody in this hotel can understand is why, wheneverybody is clamoring for a cease-fire, the government seems toignore the pleas,'' said a 24-year-old Briton, who asked that hisname not be used.   Evacuation was delayed by sporadic automatic weapons fire asloyalist advanced against the estimated 400 rebellious army ScoutRangers holed up in more than 22 buildings.   About 50 pieces of luggage were lined up in the lobby, ready forloading into two dozen buses waiting to evacuate 350 guests, mostof whom waited in their rooms.   Dim lights powered by the hotel generator shone in the lobby andin a bar and restaurant on the ground floor. Two security guards inblue uniforms stood at the front desk.   Some guests asked the journalists about conflicting reports ofevents on television and radio, their only sources of informationbecause newspapers had not been available since Sunday, the dayafter rebels moved into the district.   Carroll Greathouse of Stamford, Conn., said the hotel managementhad been ``superb'' and the rebels ``behaved admirably.''   ``The Rangers have conducted themselves as gentlemen with a lowprofile, although they're upstairs on the roof,'' he said.   Allan Campbell, 61, of Lancaster, Pa., and Peter Butler, 64, ofWashington, D.C., sat in a fourth-floor corridor talking with otherguests. They said they were with a Dallas-based company named IPACthat had recruited 1,300 Filipinos to work at the U.S. naval baseon Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.   The rebels seemed ``genuinely interested'' in getting theforeigners out of the hotel, they said.   Campbell described the long delay in evacuation as ``very, veryfrustrating,'' and Butler said: ``Nobody seems to know what's goingon and communication is very poor.''   He said a rebel captain had a long talk with them, making therebel case against President Corazon Aquino.   In an impromptu news conference, Lt. Col. Galvez expressed thehope that Filipinos would understand the ``pure intentions'' of themutineers.   ``We also do not want bloodshed and we hope this will all cometo an end soon. We are willing to stop all of this,'' he declared,but said the rebels wwould not surrender.   Peter Sheldon, 50, of Australia said the previous four days hadbeen ``pretty harrowing.''   Guests were told to go to the corridors when they heardshooting, he said, and ``we don't know who we are hostages for, forthe rebels or for the soldiers.''</TEXT></DOC>
