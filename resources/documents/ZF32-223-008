(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>2 If 33-MHz 80486 machines are supposed to be today's powerhouses, withtowering performance matched by equally towering price tags, then NationalMicro Systems has missed the mark.andP;  Oh, it got the performance part of theequation right, but there is nothing towering about the $4,999 price of itsFlash 486-33 tower computer, complete with 8MB of RAM, an ESDI 300MB harddisk, a 1.2MB floppy disk drive, a Super VGA display subsystem, one paralleland two serial ports, a game port, and DOS 3.3.andM;You might expect that the company has accomplished this price-cutting featwith some severe corner-cutting, but there is no evidence of that.andP;  Thefairly standard tower enclosure provides front-mounted power, reset, andturbo buttons.andP;  Three half-height drive bays are accessible through the frontpanel, but these account for less than half of the possible drive expansion.andO;Five more half-height bays hide behind the front panel, giving you room forenough storage devices to handle most network needs should you choose to makethe Flash 486-33 a file server.andP;  If you do fill all of the drive bays, you'llprobably need to upgrade the power supply, but the 230-watt DVE unit suppliedshould get you more than half the way there.andM;National Micro Systems hasn't pinched on the motherboard either.andP;  It's an AMIVoyager board that relies heavily on discrete components in place of thehighertech large-scale integrated devices sometimes used as the processorchip set and cache controller.andP;  That is possibly the only concession tocost-effectiveness, but it hasn't cost anything in performance.andP;  On ourtested unit, the board was populated with 8MB of 70-nanosecond RAM backed by128K of 25-ns.andP;  cache SRAM, a combination that fell right in line with thememory and processor benchmark test scores of the other machines we reviewedin this roundup.andM;There's no scrimping on expansion with the Voyager board, either.andP;  While themotherboard memory tops out at 8MB, a proprietary slot will accommodate amemory expansion card to bring the system to its maximum of 24MB.andP;  There arealso two 8-bit and six 16-bit slots.andP;  Five of the eight remain open aftervideo, disk controller, and parallel/serial boards are inserted.andM;System BIOS shadowing is always enabled on AMI Voyager boards, and video BIOSshadowing can be set through the standard CMOS setup routine.andM;Perhaps the most surprising feature at this price level is the Maxtor 300MBESDI hard disk and UltraStor controller.andP;  PC Magazine Labs' suite of disktests takes little advantage of the controller's 32K buffer, but even so, thepair managed to finish with above-average performance speeds.andM;National Micro Systems has also tossed in a 16-bit Ahead Wizard Super VGAcard and a TVM 3a multiscanning monitor.andP;  While neither of these  is ahousehold name, they proved slightly better-than-average performers on ourvideo tests.andP;  What's more, the appearance of text and graphics isspectacular.andM;National Micro Systems has bunched together a typical collection ofthird-party technical manuals, but as is often the case, there's practicallyno user documentation.andP;  Fortunately, NMS does provide phone support to helpyou through your questions.andM;Service is a definite plus, with the company offering help through phonediagnostics and parts shipping.andP;  National Micro Systems covers the Flash486-33 for 15 months on parts and two years on labor.andM;Normally, midlevel managers end up with something on the declining edge oftechnology as their computer systems.andP;  The Flash 486-33's price is a morethan reasonable excuse to put an end to that.andP;  Its FCC Class A rating willconfine it to offices, but it's a class A machine that should make a greatworking tool, whether on someone's desktop or as a server.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
