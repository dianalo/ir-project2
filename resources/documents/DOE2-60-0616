<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-60-0616 </DOCNO><TEXT>A microscopic model of ionization and Coulomb capture inelastic processin collisions of slow particles M/sup -/({mu}/sup -/, {pi}/sup -/ etc.)with hydrogen molecules is developed for the first time. Muon slowing-downtime (t/sub s/) is calculated from the initial energy E/sub 0/=2 keVup to the final energy for the hydrogen at 0.25 Torr pressure. The obtainedvalue of t/sub s/=780 ns is in a satisfactory agreement with experimental(670 ns) one obtained by other authors under the same conditions. 4 refs.;4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
