In issuing its opinion, the SEC cited Mr. Antoniu's &quot;lack of remorse.&quot; It quoted the former investment banker as stating: &quot;I pleaded guilty as part of a cooperation agreement to resolve this problem. Nobody at that time and since has been able to clearly explain to me whether I committed a crime and what the crime was.&quot;    Mr. Antoniu couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Antoniu, a graduate of the Harvard Business School, worked in the corporate finance department of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. from 1972 until 1975, and then in the acquisitions department of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc. until July 1978, when that firm learned he was a target of an SEC investigation.    Mr. Antoniu pleaded guilty to securities fraud in 1980 and, after cooperating with prosecutors, was convicted in 1982. He was fined $5,000 and was sentenced to 39 months' probation, and to a 30-day prison term that was later suspended. The SEC later moved to bar him from working for any brokerage firm, and he appealed the decision. Most recently, he was president and chief executive of Sport-About Inc., a Minnesota-based franchiser of sporting-goods stores, and was the subject of a front-page profile in The Wall Street Journal last month. </TEXT></DOC>
