A recently announced plan by the Social Security Administrationand the Internal Revenue Service to correct the records ``is acruel hoax and a charade,'' Kenneth L. Blaylock, president of theAmerican Federation of Government Employees, told two House Waysand Means subcommittees.   The union represents 700,000 workers, including 60,000 at theSocial Security Administration.   Government auditors agreed that the chances of clearing updiscrepancies of past years look bleak.   However, the IRS-Social Security agreement ``should result inmore employees' Social Security-covered earnings being properlyreported to and recorded by SSA,'' said Joseph F. Delfico, seniorassociate director of the General Accounting Office.   Blaylock's account of the extent of the records problem wasconsiderably worse than estimates by GAO auditors.   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated theproblem could cost about 10 million beneficiaries an average of $17a month. The union put the number of affected retirees as high as40 million and estimated the loss at up to $50 a month.   The problem grows out of the dual reporting of employee earningsby employers, once a year to the Social Security Administration andonce a quarter to the IRS.   For a variety of reasons, those reports do not always match.Between 1978 and 1984, employers reported $58.8 billion less toSocial Security than they did to the IRS.   As a result, the IRS has turned over to Social Security trustfunds more than $7.7 billion in payroll taxes that are not creditedto the account of any worker and, thus, cannot be paid in benefits.   The IRS and Social Security headquarters announced a plan lastmonth for preventing such discrepancies in the future and forattempting to clear up the 10-year backlog of errors.   GAO surveyed what SSA had done to correct 3.5 million employerreports that make up the 1978-83 backlog and found that as of June10, ``most of the differences in employer reports to the twoagencies have not been resolved and likely will not be.''   ``Most employers SSA contacted either have not responded, are nolonger in business or no longer have the necessary records,'' GAO'sDelfico told the subcommittees.   Another 2.1 million employer reports for 1984 through 1986 arebeing checked as well.   Landis Neal, executive director of the National Committee toPreserve Social Security and Medicare, told the subcommittee thatSSA is giving up too easily on many employers that are responsiblefor the backlog of earlier years.   ``SSA now claims that is has `resolved' almost all of the 3.5million cases of missing or discrepant employer wage reports thataccumulated between 1978 and 1983,'' Neal said. ``What SSA means,however, is that it considers these cases closed.   ``Unfortunately, for hundreds of thousands of these cases, theagency made no effort to correct the records because the amountinvolved was, in its view, `too small','' Neal said.   Norman Goldstein, chief financial officer of SSA, urged workersto use a new government form to make sure that their own SocialSecurity earnings records are correct. The form, SSA-7004, isavailable in Social Security offices or by calling 1-800-937-2000.</TEXT></DOC>
