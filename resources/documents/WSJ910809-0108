Edward Markey, chairman of a Housesubcommittee that will take up the Bush administration'sbanking bill next month, is pushing for changes that wouldsharply boost the Securities and Exchange Commission's powerover banks.   &quot;Banks that have securities powers should be regulated bythe SEC,&quot; Mr. Markey (D., Mass.) wrote in a memo toDemocratic members of the House Energy and CommerceCommittee's Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance.</LP><TEXT>   The administration's proposal to modernize the bank lawswould scrap the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act separating banks andsecurities firms, tighten bank regulation, bolster the bankdeposit insurance fund, and allow banks to combine withcommercial companies. The banking committees in the House andthe Senate have passed versions of the administration'sproposal. But in the House, the Energy and Commerce panelmust consider portions of the bill that will pit banks, whichwant to offer new financial services, directly againstsecurities firms and insurance companies.   The Commerce panel and its finance subcommittee are moresympathetic to the interests of securities firms than tobanks. Because they oversee the SEC, they're also interestedin expanding the agency's power in order to enhance their owninfluence.   Mr. Markey's comments on the banking bill reflect thisstance. Still, some of his proposals, outlined in a four-pageconfidential memo, go beyond what committee Republicans andsome Democrats are likely to support. He would establishstrong &quot;firewalls&quot; between banks and securities affiliates&quot;to ensure the integrity of the securities markets, toprotect investors, and to preserve the safety and soundnessof the banking system.&quot; He wants to give the SEC strong powerto enforce bank activities in the securities field.   In addition, he said &quot;no securities entity should bepermitted to affiliate with a bank unless that bank and allof its affiliates use mark-to-market accounting procedures.&quot;That would force many banks to write down the value oflong-term loans and other assets to reflect current marketvalue. SEC Chairman Richard Breeden backs this change, whichbanks resist as too disruptive.   Mr. Markey also opposes the Treasury proposal to allowcommercial companies to purchase banks, although some membersof his panel are toying with the idea of letting suchcompanies buy failing banks as a way to bring more capitalinto the banking system. He said the panel should considerrolling back current laws that allow commercial concerns,such as American Express Co., General Electric Co., MerrillLynch andamp; Co. and others, to own limited-service banks.   He also wants to regulate bank dealings in derivativesecurities, such as foreign-currency swaps, options andfutures.</TEXT></DOC>
