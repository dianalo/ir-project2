The committee action on the bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 represents a high-powered maneuver to revive the stalled waste program. Nuclear power advocates succeeded in advancing the bill by effectively narrowing the search for a site for a national nuclear waste dump to just a few states. Nevada would be left as the most likely location for a permanent underground repository, and Tennessee is widely seen as the leading candidate for a temporary &quot;monitored retrievable storage&quot; facility in the East.    Senators from both of those states bitterly protested the legislation, but they lost, on votes of 19-6 and 17-8 respectively, as their previous allies decided to support the plan after winning concessions. Site selection in the Northeast would be put off until at least the year 2110. And Oregon, home of the committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Mark Hatfield, won protective legal provisions as well as separate language to keep the Hanford military plutonium production reactor, located across the border in Washington state, closed down through the fiscal year.    In an effort to appease critics, $100 million would be paid annually to whichever state is chosen as the site for the permanent repository, and $50 million would go to the state that accepts the planned temporary facility. The money would come from anticipated savings resulting from narrowing the site selection process, but Sen. Harry Reid (D., Nev.) labeled the plan a &quot;political answer to a scientific problem.&quot;    Serious opposition to the plan remains in the House, but yesterday's vote was a major victory for Sen. Bennett Johnston, a nuclear power advocate who championed the plan in the appropriations panel and in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which he chairs. The energy panel approved a similar package in late July, but by winning in the appropriations committee, the Louisiana Democrat will gain more leverage and a better chance of getting the measure to the Senate floor.    The legislation will be the first of the 13 annual appropriations bills to move to the full Senate. While the Energy Department has been publicly neutral on the new nuclear waste plan, Sen. Johnston said the administration backs the measure. The current effort to find a national nuclear waste dump is stalled by lawsuits and controversy, and when the department last year tentatively proposed three Western sites -- in Texas, Nevada and Washingtonit provoked election-year opposition from some of President Reagan's closest friends.    Instead of requiring the Energy Department to pursue tests at all three underground locations, as previously envisioned, the new plan would require the department to invest in just one site -- most likely the Yucca Mountain area in Nevada. The department could proceed with construction only if the results prove successful. But if the Nevada site passes muster, the cost alone of conducting subsequent tests elsewhere -- almost $2 billion per site -- could influence the department to favor the Nevada site.    The new plan would require the department to start over again with the less costly process for selecting the site for the temporary waste-storage facility in the East. That would give opponents of the Energy Department's current first choice, Oak Ridge, Tenn., a partial victory by delaying for about a year final selection of a site. But critics of the Energy Department fear the plan would do nothing to prevent the department ultimately from choosing the Tennessee location.    Separately, Energy Department officials said the agency will be looking for a new manager for the nuclear waste program. Ben Rusche, who headed the controversial program while it encountered strong resistance from the states in recent years, has decided to resign soon, the officials said.    The underlying appropriations bill would represent a 6.3% increase in new budget authority for federal energy and water programs, or more than $949 million above the current fiscal year. The Energy Department's share of spending on the Strategic Defense Initiative -- the administration's research into anti-missile defense systems -- would be held at slightly below the current level, but the department's overall defense activities would rise $267.5 million. The increase would include $25 million toward the construction of possibly two new reactors to produce such materials as tritium needed in the manufacture of weapons. </TEXT></DOC>
