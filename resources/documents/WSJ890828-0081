The CFTC also said its preliminary review of the exchange's July 11 emergency action to avert a soybean squeeze turned up no evidence of insider trading on the part of the directors.    The vote was 16-1, with three directors not voting, to order Ferruzzi, an Italian grain merchant, to liquidate its dominant position in the July soybean futures contract. None of the directors who voted had a personal stake in July soybeans, according to the agency's report. Six directors were affiliated with commodity firms that held short positions or had customers holding predominantly short positions in the July contract. One of the six affiliated directors, however, recused himself from voting because he had a personal position in the contract.    &quot;We don't see any smoking guns, based on what we've looked at,&quot; said Andrea Corcoran, the CFTC's director of trading and markets. The affiliated directors &quot;represented they didn't have any control or influence over the trading activities of their firms.    &quot;It doesn't look like anyone was in a position to profit on advance knowledge of the board's order,&quot; she added. But the CFTC staff plans further interviews with the affiliated directors and with exchange officials.    The report didn't identify the affiliated directors.    Many farm groups pressed for the conflict of interest investigation because soybean futures prices acted suspiciously a few hours before the Board of Trade's directors took action against Ferruzzi.    On July 11, a late selling wave swept the price of the July contract sharply lower. Only later, after trading had ended for the day, did brokers learn of the CBOT's move. Many traders have speculated that information about the impending move seeped into the market. When trading resumed the next morning, prices plunged on news that Ferruzzi would have to sell contracts covering more than 20 million bushels.    That July 12 price plunge benefited traders who had a short position in the July futures contract, which in market parlance describes traders who had earlier sold futures contracts requiring them to deliver soybeans in July at designated grain elevators. These traders profited because they could buy back contracts for less than they sold them for, thus allowing them to end their delivery obligation and pocket the price difference.    The CFTC said it scrutinized soybean trading from July 3 through July 12 and found that no traders appeared to be taking new short positions in advance of the liquidation order. &quot;Indeed, most traders maintained practically identical positions during the review period,&quot; the report said.    Nonetheless, the agency's disclosure of affiliated directors' votes is likely to fuel the debate over the exchange's ability to regulate itself. A CBOT spokesman said the exchange will issue a statement on the CFTC report today.    David Swanson, chief executive of Ferruzzi Group's Central Soya Co., said that the Milan-based conglomerate believes the report &quot;indicates a potential conflict of interest among some directors.&quot;    He also challenged the report's conclusion that the exchange's emergency action was necessary to avoid disorder in the soybean market as the July contract expired.    Ferruzzi didn't &quot;plan to, and would never, take any action disruptive to the market,&quot; he said. Ferruzzi believed on July 10 that &quot;it had an adequate number of working days before the contract expired in which to crush soybeans, purchase soybeans and continue to export soybeans, all of which would have brought Ferruzzi below the hedging level set for us by the CFTC.&quot;    CFTC officials will be grilled Sept. 8 when they present their preliminary findings to the Senate Agriculture Committee. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), the committee chairman, emphasized the importance of questioning the affiliated directors further. &quot;The public will not tolerate self-dealing or conflicts of interest by exchange director or insiders,&quot; he said Friday in a statement. </TEXT></DOC>
