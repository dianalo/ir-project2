 There were 155exhibitors, up from 143 last year.andM;In a challenge to Toshiba's DynaBook computer, several other firms unveiledtheir notebook-sized computers.andP;  Japan's personal computer giant NECexhibited its 98 NOTE computer, which has an A4 file size and weighs 2.9kilograms (6.4 pounds).andP;  NEC contends the machine's embedded V30microprocessor runs the same programs as NEC's PC-9800 series personalcomputers.andP;  However, NEC only had one prototype at the show which show-goerscould view but not touch, making it impossible to verify this compatibilityclaim.andP;  The presence of this prototype led some to criticize NEC forattempting to play &quot;catch up&quot; with Toshiba, which is supplying its notebookcomputer to Fuji Xerox on an OEM (original equipment manufacturing) basis.andO;The critics were also skeptical about NEC's claim that it will ship workingmodels by the end of November, even though it could not provide anoperational prototype for the show.andM;At the opposite booth, IBM Japan revealed its IBM 5499 Online Note whichRicoh produces for it.andP;  The machine features the same A4 size, 2 kilogramweight (4 1/2 pounds), an internal modem which enables the machine tocommunicate online with PS/55 series personal computers or host systems, anda 3.5 hour battery life.andP;  Ricoh also exhibited the notebook-sized computerunder its brand name of Mr. MyTool.andM;Front-runner Toshiba, occupying a booth designed to look like the inside ofan airplane, allowed show-goers to get first-hand experience with its popularDynaBook computer and showed several new programs for the popular machine.andM;Elsewhere, Fujitsu exhibited the PQ/XT pocket computer which is compatiblewith IBM PC/XT and developed by U.S.-based Poqet Computer, which it partiallyowns.andM;There were several prototype color laptops which drew the most attention fromthe crowd.andM;Hitachi exhibited two prototype color laptop computers.andP;  One is a 32-bitcomputer with a 10-inch TFT (thin film transistor) color LCD (liquid crystaldisplay) screen with 640 by 480 pixels, which the firm claims provides aresponsive, high-speed, vivid display.andP;  This machine will be sold in overseascountries.andP;  Another is an 80386SX-based computer with an STN (super twistednematic) color LCD screen capable of displaying 8 or 16 colors.andP;  It runsJapanese OS/2 or Microsoft Windows.andM;Matsushita Electric Industrial showed a sample of its Panacom M color laptopcomputer with a 16-color LCD screen with 640 by 400 pixel resolution and a 20megahertz 80386 microprocessor.andP;  A two-megabyte 3.5-inch floppy drive and a40-megabyte hard drive are built in the machine.andP;  Matsushita claims that themachine is compatible with its M series personal computers.andM;Ricoh also exhibited prototypes of its two MyTool color laptop machines.andP;  Onehas a 32-bit microprocessor and a TFT active matrix 10-inch display.andP;  Anotheris a 32-bit machine with a simple matrix 10-inch screen capable of displaying16 colors in 640 by 400 pixels.andM;Furthermore, Mitsubishi Electric revealed its AX-based color laptopprototype.andP;  This machine has a TFT active matrix 10-inch LCD screen.andM;At the NEC booth, a large crowd gathered around its PC-9801 LX5C color laptopmachine with a backlit STN color LCD screen capable of displaying 8 colorsand an 80286 microprocessor.andP;  The machine is the first color laptop computerreleased in Japan.andM;On the other hand, Sharp revealed two transportable workstations with theworld's first backlit 14-inch color DST (double super twist) LCD screen.andO;Both machines have an 80386 microprocessor and a 40-megabyte hard drive, andare compatible with an IBM PC/AT.andP;  One of them, without Japanese languagefeatures, weighs only 13.5 kilograms (29 pounds).andM;The show also featured several machines based on Intel's top-of-the- line80486 microprocessor.andP;  Kyocera unveiled a prototype of what it calls &quot;SuperPersonal Computer&quot; 486AX machine.andP;  The embedded i486 processor includes acache memory and a mass coprocessor, runs at 25 megahertz, and operates dataat 17 MIPS (million instructions per second).andP;  Moreover, the 32-bit EISA(extended industry standard architecture) bus fully exploits the power of themicroprocessor.andM;At the IBM Japan booth, many visitors came to see IBM's 80486-25MHz UpgradeKit, which upgrades an IBM 5550-V machine to a 486 machine class, and whichincludes an 8-kilobyte cache memory and a cache controller.andM;Electronic organizers were also popular at this show.andP;  At the NEC booth, bigcrowds gathered around its prototype &quot;new-generation&quot; hand-held organizer.andO;This marks the firm's first entry into the electronic organizer market.andP;  Thenew machine has several features for its size: phone directory, name card,scheduling, clock, world clock, calendar, calculator, spreadsheet, memo pad,day table, simple mapping, and montaging.andP;  NEC claims the attached bar codereader will serve a wide variety of applications.andP;  The machine has aninternal serial interface which enables data exchange or program transmissionbetween machines or between it and a personal computer or a word processor.andO;Also, it has a standard QWERTY-type keyboard, and a large-for-its- size LCDscreen with 160 by 64 pixels.andM;At the another booth, Casio exhibited its Super Electronic Organizer whichhas the same features with NEC's but without simple mapping and montaging.andO;The machine uses an optional IC (integrated circuit) card to runapplications.andP;  Elsewhere, Japan's electronic organizer giant Sharp showed itsWizard machines which now have a great number of IC card-based applications.andM;There were also several other new machines caught people's attentions.andM;Sanyo's &quot;palm-size word processor,&quot; called Electronic Stationery, has a16-bit microprocessor, measures 197 by 111 by 24 millimeters, and operatesfor about seven hours with a full alkaline battery charge.andP;  The displayadopts an STN LCD screen with 240 by 136 pixels.andM;NEC's PC-H98 Model 70 attracted huge crowd, with its original 32-bit bus NESA(new extended standard architecture) designed to tap the full power of theembedded 386 microprocessor.andM;NTT Data Communications Systems, a subsidiary of NTT, exhibited itsmultimedia station TAO, which includes such features as a multifunctionalphone, facsimile, word processor, personal computer, CAPTAIN (character andpattern telephone access information network system) terminal, and onlineterminal.andP;  The machine is operated by the simple touching of the 14-inchcolor display.andM;Nippon Kokan exhibited its &quot;personal supercomputer&quot; for scientific technologycalculations.andP;  The 386SX processor operates data at 15 million FLOPS(floating point operations per second).andM;Among the foreign products, the Macintosh Portable and IIci from AppleComputer and the Next Computer from NeXT drew a respectable audience.andM;Fujitsu exhibited its much-hyped FM-Towns computers, which has yet to attractmuch interest.andM;All in all, Newsbytes found this year's Datashow to be the best ever held.andM;(Ken Takahashi/19891026)</TEXT></DOC>
