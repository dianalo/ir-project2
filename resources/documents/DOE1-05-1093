Solutionsto the carbon dioxide problem are particularly difficult because adverseeffects will be felt by future generations, but remedial action and sacrificesmust be made by present generations. Decisions regarding the problemwhich affect both the immediate and long-range future must be made deliberatelyor by default in perhaps only 15-20 years, before we are reasonably confidentwith our knowledge of the problem and before we know whether it will,in fact, occur. Much of the uncertainty involves projections of futureenergy use, and scientific knowledge of the carbon cycle and the environment.</TEXT></DOC>
