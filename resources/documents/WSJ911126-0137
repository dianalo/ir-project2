The proposed sale emphasizes the strikingly differentstrategies taken by the two energy-based concerns. Tennecobegan diversifying beyond its oil and natural gas roots inthe late 1960s, and it has been struggling. Enron, a Houstonconcern, continues to grow as an integrated energy company,and it's turning big profits despite low gas prices.</LP><TEXT>   Tenneco's natural gas liquids business is a burgeoningenterprise that's building a plant in La Porte, Texas, toproduce an automobile gasoline additive expected to sell wellas new federal clean air requirements take effect.   But the proposed divestiture is part of the more than $1billion of planned asset sales unveiled by Tenneco inSeptember. Such sales are the conglomerate's latest attemptto make good on a 1988 turnaround promise by James L.Ketelsen, the company's chairman and chief executive officer,who is gradually giving up the reins to Michael H. Walsh. Therestructuring was announced within days of Mr. Walsh's beingnamed president in September.   Tenneco's natural gas liquids business accounted for about10% of its gas-pipeline unit's third-quarter revenue of$422.3 million. Quarterly pretax profit at the unit fell 17%to $17 million.   Mr. Walsh said selling the gas liquids business&quot;constitutes the key element of the company's non-core&quot;divestiture strategy &quot;and is a cornerstone of the overallaction plan.&quot;   But some analysts have wondered recently just which ofTenneco's assets really are its core for the future. Thecompany's most troubled unit -- the J I Case farm andconstruction equipment business -- accounts for the biggestchunk of sales: 37%. Tenneco also has interests inshipbuilding, automotive parts, chemicals and packaging.   Tenneco hopes the current shedding of assets producesbetter results than the drastic 1988 restructuring thatjettisoned $7.6 billion in oil and gas properties to pay downdebt and concentrate on other operations.   But the disparate batch of remaining units keeps hittingsnags. For the nine months, Tenneco's net loss was $706million, or $5.87 a share, compared with net income of $431million, or $3.34 a share, a year ago. The loss includedrestructuring charges of $472 million, or $3.86 a share.Revenue fell 5.7% to $10.1 billion.   For Enron, liquid natural gas is a core strategy. Thenatural-gas pipeline company has put increased emphasis ongas liquid -- whose price moves more closely with that ofcrude than with natural gas. Crude prices have been steady,while natural gas prices hit five-year lows during thesummer.   John Olson, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., said theacquisition shows Enron's &quot;perception that the price ofnatural gas will remain depressed relative to crude oil.&quot; Headded that the move shows &quot;Enron has a real vision of whereit fits in the gas business.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
