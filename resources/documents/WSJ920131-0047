The bond market's bellwether security, the 30-yearTreasury bond, finished about 3/8 point lower, a loss ofabout $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The priceof the benchmark bond was quoted late at 102 11/32 to yield7.78%, down from Wednesday's closing price of 102 24/32 toyield 7.75%.</LP><TEXT>   Since peaking at 107 7/32 to yield 7.39% on January 8, theprice of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds has fallennearly five points, a loss of nearly $50 for each $1,000bond. The sell-off has resulted from a number of factors,including hedging activity related to a deluge of newcorporate debt and uncertainty about the future of monetarypolicy. Another factor is fear about how President Bush'sproposals for economic growth will affect business activityand the size of the nation's ballooning federal budgetdeficit.   Steven Ricchiuto, bond market analyst at Barclays de ZoeteWedd Securities Inc., says that too much supply is the mainproblem with the bond market.   &quot;Supply is what's plaguing the market,&quot; said Mr.Ricchiuto. &quot;You have new corporate bonds, mortgage-backedsecurities and new municipal bonds. Add to that theTreasury's {quarterly refunding of the federal debt} thatwill soon take place and you end up with,&quot; a very nervousmarket, he said. &quot;No one wants to be aggressive in front ofsupply.&quot; The Treasury will announce details of the quarterlyrefunding next week. Analysts expect the federal governmentto sell between $38 billion and $40 billion of securities.   In trading yesterday, the market opened slightly lowerthen staged a modest rally in late morning. But by earlyafternoon, prices had begun to erode, a pattern that isgrowing all too familiar.   &quot;Every morning we try to rally, but when we get to earlyafternoon, sellers come into the market. We just can't seemto hold the gains,&quot; said Leonard Santow, a director at Griggsandamp; Santow Inc., a financial advisory firm.   Hardest hit yesterday were intermediate-term securities,especially those with maturities between five years and 10years. These securities, &quot;got slaughtered,&quot; said Mr. Santow.The latest 10-year Treasury note ended at a price of 101 8/32to yield 7.30% compared with 101 22/32 to yield 7.24% onWednesday. The latest five-year notes ended at 99 to yield6.46% compared with 99 9/32 to yield 6.405%.   There were two explanations for the sharp sell-off in theintermediate sector. Traders said that many investors,fearful that the market may slide further but not ready toturn completely bearish, are reshaping their portfolios totake a defensive posture. They are doing this by adopting the&quot;barbell&quot; strategy, selling intermediate-term securities andheavily weighting their portfolios toward long-termsecurities and short-term securities.   That way, &quot;you are long in case the market rallies and youhave a lot of cash in the case the market comes down. That'sone way a cash account can hedge,&quot; said an analyst at oneprimary dealer.   Mr. Santow believes that comments from White House BudgetDirector Richard Darman may have battered intermediate-termsecurities. Mr. Darman told Congress that theadministration's new budget proposals assume a shift from thesale of longer-term debt to lower-yielding, shorter-termsecurities.   The remarks massacred intermediate-term securities, saidMr. Santow, because investors are assuming that if theTreasury reduces the amount of 30-year bonds it sells it willfill in the gap by increased sales of intermediate-termsecurities. (Of course, that would not explain why prices of10-year notes declined so sharply, since the Treasury isn'tconsidering raising the auction size of that maturity.)   Meanwhile, bond market participants continued to debateprospects for further easing of monetary policy as they lookahead to the next meeting of the Federal Open MarketCommittee, beginning Tuesday. The FOMC is the FederalReserve's arm for setting and executing monetary policy.   Some economists are looking for a further easing inmonetary policy, although there is widespread disagreementover how soon.   Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities AmericaInc., believes &quot;the chances of the Fed easing monetary policynext week are quite low&quot; after its aggressive one-point cutin the discount rate to 3.5% last month. &quot;Having just easedso substantially at the end of December, the Fed will holdsteady for a while,&quot; Mr. Moran says. But, he adds, &quot;we willget one more easing of Fed policy,&quot; likely before the end ofthe first quarter.   However, the Fed &quot;is probably closer to easing than isgenerally perceived,&quot; argues F. Ward McCarthy, managingdirector of Stone andamp; McCarthy Research Associates. &quot;In theFed's parlance, the Fed will continue to be alert to signs ofeconomic weakness,&quot; and will be quick to ease in response tocontinued sluggish economic activity, he adds.   The latest economic data appear to support the view heldby many market participants that the economy has yet torespond much to the most recent cuts in interest rates.   Yesterday morning, the Commerce Department reported thatdurable goods orders fell 5.0% in December, far surpassingthe 0.7% decline estimated on average by economists polled byDow Jones Capital Markets Report.   And in another sign of an ailing labor market, initialclaims for state unemployment insurance rose 24,000 in theweek ended Jan. 18, in contrast with the 1,000 drop that hadbeen the average forecast.   However, some Fed officials warn that indications ofeconomic weakness don't justify quick fixes by Congress andthe Bush administration.   One such speaker was E. Gerald Corrigan, president of theFederal Reserve Bank of New York, who appeared yesterday atthe New York State Bankers Association's mid-winter meeting.&quot;Perhaps nowhere is that temptation to find shortcuts moredangerous than in regard to fiscal policy, especially in anelection year,&quot; he said.   Any changes in fiscal policy, &quot;should be surgically neatand clean,&quot; should &quot;give particular emphasis to the almostdesperate need to rebuild the stock of productive plant andequipment in this country, and, above all, any changes mustnot do further damage to the deficit outlook for theintermediate term,&quot; said Mr. Corrigan.   Separately, the Treasury market didn't react appreciablyto news that the M2 measure of money supply surged $16.1billion in the week ended Jan. 20, significantly more thanthe $7.5 billion jump that economists surveyed by Dow JonesCapital Markets Report had forecast.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds   Nearly $900 million of new debt hit the corporate market,although about twothirds was offered by a single borrower,the Federal Home Loan Banks.   In the secondary market for corporate bonds,investment-grade issues slumped, posting losses of 1/8 to 1/4point. High-risk high-yield bonds, however, ended littlechanged in a lackluster trading session.   The Federal Home Loan Banks, which provides a flexiblecredit reserve for member savings institutions, sold nearly$600 million of debt securities in four offerings.   The largest issue, $255 million of three-year notes, waspriced to yield 5.69% through underwriter Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.Additional notes in five-year, seven-year and 10-yearmaturities were brought to market through differentunderwriters.   Proceeds from the offerings will be loaned to the agency'smembers to extend mortgages to consumers.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage securities prices ended lower, but losses weretempered by dealer purchases for collateral for a long lineof planned real estate mortgage investment conduit deals.   In secondary trading, Government National MortgageAssociation 7.5% securities for February delivery were down10/32 at 96 30/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Gold 7.5%securities were off 6/32 at 96 1/32, and Federal NationalMortgage Association 7.5% securities were 7/32 lower at 9526/32.   In the area of Remic new issuance, a $500 million FreddieMac deal, series Gold 1222, backed by Freddie Mac Gold 8%mortgage securities, was offered by Donaldson, Lufkin andamp;Jenrette Securities Corp.   In addition to Remic issuance, mortgage securities marketplayers await the next round of prepayment statistics. Thatkicks off with Monday's unveiling of Freddie Mac figures forthe mid-December to mid-January period.   The statistics, along with coming Fannie Mae and GinnieMae figures for all of January, are expected to confirm thatthere was no letup in the mortgage refinancing spree that haspersisted for weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
