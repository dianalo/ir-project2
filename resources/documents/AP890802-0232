CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   What started as a small, ridiculed but exuberantreligious experience in America around the start of the century hasswelled into a worldwide Christian phenomenon.   Called the Pentecostal or charismatic movement, it is one of thefastest growing forces in modern church life, spawning youngdenominations and stimulating old ones.   ``There is no question but that it is revitalizing Christianityacross the world, particularly the older forms of Christianity,''said the Rev. David B. Barrett, a top authority on religiousdemographics.   A large, influential branch of that movement in America, theAssemblies of God, marks its 75th anniversary at its conventionAug. 8-13 in Indianapolis, bustling and confident.   ``God has been very good to us and we're grateful for it,'' saidthe Rev. G. Raymond Carlson of Springfield, Mo., the denomination'sgeneral superintendent.   ``There is enthusiasm, growth, awakening everythere,'' he addedin a telephone interview. ``We feel the future is very bright. Andthat's not just puff.''   Barrett, a British Anglican, editor of the World ChristianEncyclopedia, now working for the Southern Baptist Foreign MissionsBoard in Richmond, Va., said the world's Pentecostals-charismaticstotal 353 million.   That includes 184 million Pentecostal church members, 23 millionof them in North America; 133 million ``charismatics'' in mainlinechurches, 44 million in the U.S., and 30 million ``third wave''renewalists, 12 million in the U.S.   ``It's happening on a vast scale,'' Barrett said in a telephoneinterview. ``The movement has a strong moral and ethical side. Fromevery point of view, it's a major and positive development.''   The Assemblies of God, with more than 2.1 million U.S.adherents, has grown 66 percent in the last decade from just under1.3 million, putting it among the nation's 10 largest Protestantdenominations.   Its missionaries have planted overseas branches, totaling anadditional 16.2 million.   With headquarters in Springfield, Mo., it has 18 U.S. colleges,including a seminary, and runs several health-care facilities. ItsGospel Publishing House turns out an average of 24 tons ofreligious literature a day.   In surmounting the downfall in sex scandals of two of itsprominent TV ministers, Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart, thedenomination gained widened respect for its principled handling ofthe matter.   It firmly revoked ministerial credentials when disciplines wererejected, although in doing so it gave up large revenues, including$12 million annually from Swaggart's former ministry.   But supportive ``response has been far greater,'' Carlson said,noting that contributions to worldwide ministries were up 9.9percent to $284 million for the last biennium.   ``We made our decision, not on the basis of money, but on thebasis of what Scripture teaches,'' he said. ``I've been so gratefulthat we've heard from many denominational leaders in appreciationfor our reinforcing the credibility of the church in the world.''   While the Assemblies of God has kept growing, in contrast tomainline membership declines, the gains have slackened lately.``There are ebbs and flows,'' Carlson said.   Asked if the denomination at its 75-year mark might besuccumbing to institutional cumbersomeness, sapping its initialspontaneity and enthusiasm, Carlson said:   ``I don't think so. We keep talking about that, warning againstit and listening to the counsel of the word of God, reminding thechurch not to lose the fervor that the Holy Spirit loosed in it.''   The Indianapolis convention is to launch the denomination's mostambitious evangelism program, ``Decade of Harvest.''   It envisions winning 5 million people to Christ, opening 5,000new churches, and training 20,000 new ministers in the next decade,with 1 million ``prayer partners'' praying daily for it.   ``We've tried to keep evangelism alive,'' Carlson said. ``A lotof people think that glossolalia (speaking in `tongues') is ourmain doctrine, but it's not. Rather it's the message of Christ'ssalvation. He meets the needs of humanity.''   However, speaking or singing in ``unknown tongues'' is ahallmark of the Assemblies of God and other Pentecostals as well asthe charismatic incursion in mainline Protestantism and RomanCatholicism.   Founded at a convention in Hot Springs, Ark., in 1914, theAssemblies of God stemmed from heightened spiritual experiences insmall groups across the United States, beginning in 1901.   Other Pentecostal denominations also arose from thetongues-speaking revival, sometimes ridiculed as ``holy rollers.''   But that changed as the denomination matured, Carlson said.``We've moved across the tracks. Our congregations build nicerbuildings, and we reach into the upper middle class.''   Tongues-speaking, considered a sign of baptism by the HolySpirit, derives from apostolic times, first experienced 50 daysafter Christ's resurrection at Pentecost in Jerusalem, anddescribed in early Christian congregations.   Historic churches shunned such practices, contending they endedwith apostolic times, but such experiences have spread throughProtestantism and Catholicism as the ``charismatic movement.''   ``It has touched most mainline denominations,'' Carlson said.``It's had a great deal of impact.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Friday AMs, Aug. 4</NOTE></DOC>
