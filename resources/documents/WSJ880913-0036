(AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   United Auto Workers members voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike against Caterpillar Inc. in a move that a UAW official said is routine during contract negotiations.    The members of UAW Local 974, which represents about 10,000 of the construction equipment maker's employees in the Peoria area, voted Sunday in favor of allowing their negotiators to call a strike if it is deemed necessary, said Stan Valentine, assistant director of the local's community action program.    UAW members who work for Deere andamp; Co., based in Moline, Ill., also voted overwhelmingly over the weekend to authorize their negotiators to call a strike if necessary, said Bill Casstevens, the UAW's secretary-treasurer in Detroit. The union represents 13,500 active Deere workers and 3,500 people laid off by the maker of farm, industrial and garden equipment.    In each case, the vote was about 95% in favor of the strike authorization, the union officials said separately.    Deere officials and union negotiators began contract talks on Aug. 3 and were scheduled to resume talks this week.    At Caterpillar, contract talks are continuing, Mr. Valentine of the union local said. Strike-authorization votes are &quot;something that's customarily done&quot; during contract talks, he said. &quot;It gives the bargainers an edge, knowing their people are backing them,&quot; he added. &quot;It does give our bargainers the feeling that people are behind them and gives them the authorization to call a strike if things don't work out and the talks break down.&quot;    Mr. Valentine said Local 974 represents about half of Caterpillar's UAW workers nationwide. He said that other locals also took strike-authorization votes, but that he wasn't certain of the results. </TEXT></DOC>
