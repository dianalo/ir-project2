(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ames Department Stores Inc., which filedfor federal bankruptcy protection last week, on Monday replaced itschief executive officer with a merchandising veteran likely to trimstaff and close stores to revive the ailing discounter.   Stephen L. Pistner, former chairman at Montgomery Ward andamp; Co. andpresident at Dayton-Hudson Corp.'s Target discount stores, wasnamed by the board of directors to replace Peter B. Hollis, whoresigned as CEO and vice chairman.   Pistner also will become chairman if his appointment is approvedby a New York bankruptcy court.   Pistner, 58, is known as a decisive, intelligent businessman whopioneered the concept of power departments _ stores within storesthat specialize in particular kinds of merchandise like clothing ormajor appliances, said Howard Davidowitz, chairman of a New Yorkretail consulting firm.   ``He's a hard-nosed businessman and a very well-respectedretailer who will probably use an ax rather than a butter knife onAmes,'' said Alan Millstein, publisher of a monthly newsletter forretailers and manufacturers.   ``It's a very courageous act on the part of the board,'' addedMillstein, who said the appointment will also assuage creditors andsuppliers who are nervous about the company's ability to pay itsbills.   In a brief interview from New York, Pistner said he would notclose stores or make other major decisions until he evaluates thecompany. He said it would take a good 18 months to put it on moresolid financial footing.   Ames, based in Rocky Hill, Conn., filed for protection fromcreditors last Wednesday, listing $1.44 billion in liabilities and$1.66 billion in assets. It posted a $228 million loss for thefiscal year ended Jan. 27 and owes $14 million to its largestcreditor.   The nation's fourth-largest discounter, Ames operates more than600 stores in 20 states and employs 55,000 people. It has annualsales of more than $4 billion.   Experts trace its problems to the 392-store Zayre chain, whichAmes bought in 1988 for $788 million.   Some experts said Hollis must bear some of the responsibilityfor Ames' problems because he presided during the Zayre acquisition.   ``It was time to take Hollis out of the job because Hollis was afinancial man but didn't understand the merchandising that wasnecessary to attract customers to the stores,'' said Walter Loeb, aNew York-based retail consultant.   Davidowitz agreed: ``It's very important for creditors becausethe old management simply had no credibility. The creditors havebeen hurt very badly, and when people are hurt they want a pound offlesh and they also want to see new faces.   ``Steve is a known quantity. He's been successful in retailingfor a long time in visible major jobs.''   Pistner joined Dayton-Hudson in 1970, taking responsibility forits Target chain in 1973. He was named president and chiefoperating officer of Dayton-Hudson in 1977.   He left in 1971 to become president and chief executive ofMontgomery Ward. He left Montgomery Ward in 1985 to become chairmanof McCrory Corp., the variety store business owned byRapid-American.   Pistner left McCrory in 1988 and has spent the last two yearspursuing business enterprises, including a joint venture in theSoviet Union that he would not disclose.</TEXT></DOC>
