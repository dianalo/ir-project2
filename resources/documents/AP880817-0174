GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of anti-government protestersagain took to the streets of Burma's two largest cities Wednesday,demanding an end to 26 years of one-party rule and rigid socialism,diplomats and media reports said.   Student leaders in Rangoon made speeches before about 5,000protesters who rallied outside Rangoon General Hospital. It was thelargest demonstration in the capital since last week's bloody riotstoppled hard-line President Sein Lwin, diplomats in Rangoon said.   Japan's Kyodo News Service, in a dispatch from Rangoon, saidthere were reports of an orderly demonstration involving nearly10,000 people in Mandalay, Burma's second-largest city. The reportcould not be independently confirmed.   Also, the daughter of late Burmese independence leader Aung Sanissued a statement calling for a caretaker government that wouldlead to a multiparty system Burma has not had since 1962, accordingto a Rangoon-based Western diplomat.   The daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi, lives in Cambridge, England, butis visiting her mother in Rangoon, the diplomat said. Burmesemarchers have carried pictures of her father, who was assassinateda year before Burma achieved independence from Britain in 1948.   In Washington, a U.S. State Department official said tension wasrising in Burma before emergency political meetings scheduledFriday that may select new leaders to replace Sein Lwin.   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said securityforces did not try to interfere with Wednesday's Rangoon rally.During last week's disturbances, security forces repeatedly firedon protesters who refused to disperse.   State-run Radio Rangoon says at least 95 people were killed and240 wounded last week in the largest demonstrations since 1948.Western diplomats say they believe hundreds were killed but saythey have no evidence.   The crowd in Rangoon, which included several Buddhist monks,also held a Buddhist ceremony in front of the hospital to mournthose killed by security forces.   Sein Lwin resigned as state president and party chairman afteronly 17 days in power. He had succeeded Ne Win, whose 1962 militarycoup ended democracy in Burma and instituted one-party rule.   A senior Western diplomat said Wednesday a military coup waspossible if army commanders believe leadership changes do not meetpopular calls for reform. He reported rumors of dissension withinthe military, which may not support the government if streetprotests resume.   During last week's rioting, security forces in at least twotowns were reported to have sided with demonstrators.   The Rangoon Lawyers' Council on Tuesday lodged an unprecedentedformal protest with the government over the security forces' firingon peaceful protesters.   The letter demanded multiparty rule, lifting of the state ofemergency in Rangoon and other cities, release of detainees, a haltto use of force by security personnel, an independent investigationinto the shootings, and disclosure of information on casualties.   A copy of the text was received Wednesday by a foreign embassy.   ``It's considered significant in that many prominent people havesigned it,'' a diplomat said.   State-owned Radio Rangoon meanwhile said 52 more people arrestedin last week's riots were released Wednesday. The radio said 51were freed Tuesday in Rangoon while 30 people were released Sundayin Pegu, 45 miles northeast of Rangoon.   Several prominent figures arrested July 29-30 still are beingheld. They include the country's leading dissident, Aung Gyi, andSein Win, the Burmese correspondent of The Associated Press.   In Washington, the State Department said U.S. military trainingwill continue for Burmese officials because it does not believe thetrainees were responsible for last week's shootings. The $260,000program is the only U.S. aid granted to the isolated Asian country.</TEXT></DOC>
