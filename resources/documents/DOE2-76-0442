Theformed ozone was measured by an ultraviolet absorption ozone detector.A part of the formed ozone was decomposed during irradiation. The decompositionof ozone is mainly caused by radical reactions of OH and HO/sub 2/ withozone, and the rate of decomposition can be estimated easily by computercalculations. It is therefore possible to use this method as a gas phasedosimeter with a correction for the decomposition. The dose rate obtainedby this method was in good agreement with that of the nitrous oxide dosimeter.</TEXT></DOC>
