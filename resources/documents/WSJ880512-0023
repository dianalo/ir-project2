Production and maintenance workers, who make up the largest part of the roughly 60,000 workers covered by the pact, gave their agreement 55% support. Chrysler's unionized engineers voted 65% in favor of their version of the contract, while the company's unionized office and clerical workers voted 80% in favor of their agreement. Results from Chrysler's parts depots weren't available immediately.    The tentative agreement was reached last week and was patterned after agreements reached last year with Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. Ford workers gave the contract 70% approval; GM workers gave it 80% approval.    Chrysler workers supporting the pact said they liked new job-security provisions, which curb the number of reasons for layoffs, restrict the transfer of work to other companies, and ban any new plant closings.    Workers said they also appreciated a return to the same bargaining cycle as the other two auto makers for the first time since Chrysler's financial crisis in 1979.    Several factors depressed the Chrysler margin of approval. Many workers said they didn't think the contract offered enough money. It doesn't offer any base wage raises in its 28-month term.    While workers stand to get a $1,000 ratification bonus, some rank-and-filers complain that will be largely offset by another provision in the contract diverting certain cost-of-living-adjustment payments. The union leadership agreed to the diversion to bring Chrysler wages in line with the other auto makers.    In addition, some local unions said they were upset that the contract does nothing to save four parts plants slated for closing.    Chrysler workers traditionally are the most militant in the industry. The rank-and-file and their representatives have rejected two contracts negotiated by the leadership this decade.    The smaller-than-expected margin of approval could have disturbing implications for Chrysler. The auto maker is counting on improving relations with the union to get changes in work rules to increase quality and productivity. The vote could indicate some hostility toward management and such changes.    Chrysler, however, said in a prepared statement that it was &quot;pleased&quot; by the ratification and &quot;will continue to pursue joint efforts with the union to improve Chrysler's competitiveness.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
