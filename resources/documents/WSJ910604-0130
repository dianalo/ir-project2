Chief executive pay has risen faster than inflation andprofits for years. But now there's a recession, andcompensation packages are soaring even as earnings aresagging and unemployment is up.</LP><TEXT>   The $64 billion California Public Employees RetirementSystem last month voted its 1% stake in ITT Corp. against there-election of directors to protest Rand V. Araskog's pay.Mr. Araskog's compensation more than doubled in 1990 tonearly $9.7 million, although ITT profit rose only 3.9% andits stock price dropped 18% during the year.   A survey reported at a May 15 Senate hearing found thatthe average annual compensation of 200 big-company chiefexecutives, including salary, options and bonuses, was $2.8million. Is that too much? Here's what people from variouswalks of life think about the princely sums garnered by manyU.S. corporate chieftains:                                                                                                          SEN. CARL LEVIN   Michigan Democrat                                                                                                          &quot;During the 1980s, American CEO pay rose dramaticallywhile corporate profits in general went down. The federalgovernment is part of the problem,&quot; says the senator, whowill introduce a bill today giving stockholders a bigger sayin executive pay. &quot;The government ought to get offstockholders' backs and allow them to voice their objectionsto huge pay increases for poor performance.&quot;                                                                                                          WALTER WRISTON   Former Chairman and CEO, Citicorp                                                                                                          &quot;There is a giant ratchet effect&quot; when boards set theirchief executives' pay, says the General Electric Co.compensation committee member. Surveys &quot;come into thecompensation committee and they say, `Oh, our fellow is onlyin the third quartile' . . . so they jack it up.&quot;   But federal action isn't needed because &quot;what is happeningnow is that the market is working. There are people standingup and screaming at stockholder meetings&quot; about soaringcompensation.                                                                                                          RAND V. ARASKOG   Chairman and CEO, ITT                                                                                                          &quot;1990 happened to be a spectacular year for me. It is notgoing to repeat in '91. . . . But all I can tell all of youis, I feel I earned it,&quot; Mr. Araskog said in May at theannual meeting. He said his 1990 pay included long-termincentives tied to the company's performance over the pastthree years and rose as income targets were exceeded.   He also said the hullabaloo about hefty executivecompensation ignores richly rewarded baseball players andentertainers. &quot;CEOs are, for some reason, being singled out-- because they can be singled out -- for a type of criticismthat doesn't go with the rest of the American system.&quot;                                                                                                          MITCHELL FROMSTEIN   Chairman and CEO, Manpower Inc.                                                                                                          Mr. Fromstein was paid $1.96 million last year. Inprofessional baseball, he says, &quot;the average pitcher whopitches twice a week for two hours each time is makingsomewhere up close to $2 million a year. I work between 70and 80 hours a week and when I took over the company {in1976}, it was making under $2 million a year {pretax}. It'snow making somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million.&quot;   Perhaps that pitcher's team &quot;is in last place and ithasn't won a game in 2 1/2 weeks. . . . I don't give up homeruns when I am pitching. I win games.&quot;                                                                                                          PAUL MOLITOR   Player, Milwaukee Brewers                                                                                                          &quot;I don't think it's quite fair&quot; to compare chiefexecutives' pay with what athletes and actors earn. &quot;A CEO isin charge of a corporation, while an entertainer or athleteis someone out there who is doing something that's serviceoriented. A lot of the way we are compensated is determinedby fan reaction.&quot;   Mr. Molitor makes about $3 million a year. How much time aprofessional athlete puts in &quot;isn't what is appropriate,&quot; hesays. &quot;It goes back to supply and demand and how well theteam is doing.&quot;                                                                                                          JOHN RATZENBERGER   Actor, &quot;Cheers&quot;                                                                                                          At big corporations, chief executives &quot;are always takencare of,&quot; says Mr. Ratzenberger, who makes more than $1million a year from &quot;Cheers&quot; and serves as the unpaid chiefexecutive of a company he co-founded in 1989. &quot;I take issuewith them comparing themselves to actors. I am sure not toomany lived in an abandoned building for two years,&quot; as hedid. &quot;I find that CEOs in this country are a bunch ofwhiners.&quot;                                                                                                          PETER DRUCKER   Management Guru                                                                                                          &quot;There is no correlation between company performance andCEO pay. When you look at it, the people who earn the mostmoney have earned it in companies that have done prettypoorly.&quot;   The situation demoralizes middle managers. Theirbitterness &quot;underlies a great deal of the turmoil and thewillingness of people to jump ship. Then, top managementcomplains, `Where has the loyalty gone?'&quot;                                                                                                          MAKOTO UTSUMI   Japan's Vice Finance Minister                                                                                                          For International Affairs, In Japan, the chief executiveof a major company earns about 17 times more than the averageworker. &quot;By my tentative, hypothetical calculations, at oneAmerican company, what the chairman receives annually isabout 150 times what the skilled workers at the same companyget. In another company, the calculation is about 40 or 50times. . . . This not only has a very detrimental orcounterproductive effect on the morale of employees but alsoaffects the savings of the corporate sector. . . .Fundamentally, the U.S. should decide whether that isproductive.&quot;                                                                                                          FRED KARNAS   Executive Director,   National Coalition for the Homeless                                                                                                          American chief executives &quot;get big salaries andremuneration for departures in the millions and millions ofdollars. I think everybody does deserve a living wage. . . .But when it gets to that figure, in essence it is theft.&quot;                                                                                                          JAMES KLINIKOWSKI   Former senior engineer,   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.                                                                                                          &quot;It's almost inconceivable to me that people could makethat much money,&quot; says Mr. Klinikowski, who earned $45,000 ayear when ATandamp;T laid him off in 1990 at age 59. &quot;What do theydo with it? I am here struggling to make my medical insurancepayments, and I have no job prospects right now.&quot;                                                                                                          BEN COHEN   Chairman, CEO,   Ben andamp; Jerry's Homemade Inc.                                                                                                          &quot;I don't believe anybody is worth the kind of money&quot; thata lot of CEOs make, &quot;even if they're directingmultibillion-dollar corporations,&quot; says the ice cream maker'sco-founder, who earned $100,000 last year because the companylimits its top salary to no more than seven times the pay ofthe lowest-paid permanent worker. (He also owns about aquarter of the company's stock, but it doesn't pay adividend.)   The bigger issue is that &quot;the rich are getting richer, thepoor are getting poorer.&quot; How can CEOs, athletes and actorsdemand millions when &quot;people aren't getting their basic needsmet and are starving?&quot;   ---   Marcus W.
