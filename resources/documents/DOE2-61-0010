Depending on the type of interaction and the intrinsicproperties of each species, it is possible to consider the simulationof a mixing layer, the propagation of a constant-density chemical reactionfront, or the propagation of a reaction front accompanied by heat releaseand a change of density. The report shows that it is possible to carryout realistic simulations of nonstationary two-dimensional constant-densityreactive flows. It examines the destabilization of a shear flow (Kelvin-Helmholtzinstability) with the formation of coherent structures and vortex coalescence.It also examines the effect of these structures on the reaction ratewhen the flow rate is moderate, high, or very high with respect to diffusion.When the flow rate is very high, a very substantial increase of the reactiontime (25-fold) is observed with an intermittence phenomenon.</TEXT></DOC>
