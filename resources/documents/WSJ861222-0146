GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/22/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FORGNEXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A quiet, six-month-old State Department campaign to dissuade businesses from paying ransom to terrorists who kidnap executives has become another casualty of the Iran affair.    In a brochure distributed last summer to U.S. multinational corporations, the State Department says it &quot;strongly urges American companies and private citizens not to pay terrorist ransom demands,&quot; because this only &quot;increases the danger that others will be taken hostage.&quot;    Shortly after the Iran disclosures, Ackerman andamp; Palumbo Inc., a Miami security consulting firm, warned its clients by wire that the &quot;perception that U.S. has shipped weapons to Iran in return for release of American hostages in Beirut may spur new abductions of Americans by those out to obtain like concessions from the U.S. government, or cash from private American companies.&quot;    The Iran arms shipments &quot;sure make it harder to convincingly jawbone corporate executives&quot; about not dealing with terrorists, concedes an official associated with the State Department's counterterrorism program. &quot;Now is not a very good time to beat the drums on this.&quot;    Convincing companies to follow such a policy is, at best, a difficult task. Corporations argue that unless they make every effort to win the release of kidnap victims, it won't be easy to find executives willing to work in relatively risky areas, such as Latin America and the Mideast. Companies also fear lawsuits from family members of kidnap victims if the families think strenuous efforts weren't made.    The department launched its campaign against what it calls &quot;commercial terrorism&quot; in the belief that the prevailing corporate attitude was undercutting the government's stated no-ransom, no-negotiations policy. Indeed, the report of the Vice President's Task Force on Combating Terrorism, published in February, recommended that the Justice Department consider proposing legislation that would make ransom payments to terrorist organizations illegal. (The recommendation hasn't been acted on.)    Last year there were 67 terrorist attacks -- including kidnappings -- against American business facilities or personnel abroad, about one-third more than in each of the previous two years, the State Department says. Although Mideast terrorism receives the most media coverage, Latin America, where 35 of the attacks took place, holds the highest risk for American firms. In most cases, the kidnappings are for financial, not ideological, reasons.    On Dec. 10, 1985, for instance, three executives working at a pumping station on an oil pipeline project in Colombia, near the Venezuelan border, were kidnapped by members of the Popular Liberation Army, a small Marxist group. A day later, according to U.S. sources, one of the three was returned with a message demanding $10 million ransom for the other two, John Geddes, a Fluor Corp. employee and Edward Sohl, a Bechtel Group Inc. executive.    After months of negotiations a $2.2 million ransom was paid, the sources said. Mr. Geddes was returned June 2, but Mr. Sohl had died of a heart attack.    U.S. terrorism experts are disturbed by signs that Latin American terrorist groups, which once had little to do with one another, have begun to coordinate activities. For example, the M-19, a Colombian group, has been training members of the Ecuadoran AVC terrorist group and also is involved in helping &quot;Red Flag,&quot; a Venezuelan group, according to U.S. sources. M-19 also has organized &quot;The Americas Battalion,&quot; a multinational terrorist organization fighting in southern Colombia.    The U.S. experts say that along with the closer coordination comes a terrorist grapevine that can spread the word quickly about American companies that are willing to pay ransoms. &quot;It's a very serious development,&quot; says one U.S. official. He notes that Latin America, with its vast amounts of territory that has never been under any national government's control offers fertile ground for terrorist activities.    And some experts fear that the Reagan administration may now have sent the signal that Americans are fair game. &quot;I think there's a perception that Americans are kidnappable now,&quot; says Mike Ackerman, of Ackerman andamp; Palumbo. &quot;I'll be very surprised if we don't have a flurry of kidnappings now.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
