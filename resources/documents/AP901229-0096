(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Mario Cuomo, who had scrapped plans fora fancy inauguration because of his state's tight budget, says henow plans a modest swearing-in ceremony.   ``It won't be a big public ceremony,'' said the Democratgovernor, who begins his third four-year term on New Year's Day.   Last month, Cuomo canceled plans for a traditional publicinauguration, a move he estimated would save the state about$70,000, and planned a private inauguration instead.   Cuomo changed his mind last week, saying an inaugural ceremonyis ``a nice tradition'' although not legally necessary since he wascontinuing in office.   Cuomo and Lt. Gov. Stan Lundine will be sworn in Mondayafternoon at the New York Court of Appeals building by Chief JudgeSol Wachtler, and the ceremony will cost nothing, the governorsaid.   Earlier this month, Cuomo and the state Legislature approved apackage of spending cuts to help eliminate a projected $1 billiondeficit. The governor also is laying off 2,000 state workers by theend of the fiscal year on March 31.   When he announced he was canceling the traditional inauguration,Cuomo said he wanted to ``avoid the expense it would necessarilyentail.''   Past inaugural ceremonies included rousing gospel choirs andIndian chiefs in traditional dress.</TEXT></DOC>
