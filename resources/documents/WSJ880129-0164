The gathering, a forerunner to a top-level ministerial meeting scheduled for March 18 in West Germany, is expected to end today without movement toward a solution, the European official said.    The U.S. has complained that state aid to Airbus from the British, French, German and Spanish governments gives the consortium an illegal competitive advantage over U.S. aircraft manufacturers. European officials counter that U.S. aircraft builders receive indirect subsidies through U.S. government defense contracts. </TEXT></DOC>
