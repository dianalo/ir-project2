The thrust by 70 Israeli soldiers and militiamen of the SouthLebanon Army followed an attack by three Palestinian and leftistLebanese factions on Israel's self-designated ``security zone''along the border, police said.   An Israeli army spokesman said the militiamen killed the threeguerrillas and that Israeli forces in a separate operation detaineda number of suspects.   Guerrillas armed with automatic weapons targeted a joint patrolof Israelis and the mainly Christian militiamen on the zone'snorthern edge, said a police spokesman who cannot be identified inline with standing regulations.   Two hours later, 13 armored personnel carriers rolled out of thebuffer zone to counterattack suspected guerrilla hideouts around thevillages of Zillaya and Dellaya in the foothills of Mount Hermon,the spokesman said.   The South Lebanon Army gave the bodies of the three guerrillas tothe International Red Cross just before the incursion force withdrewinto the zone at midday without suffering any casualties, thespokesman said.   He said Israeli helicopter gunships strafed Zillaya and Dellayain repeated runs for an hour after the withdrawal.   In Jerusalem, an army spokesman indicated there were two separateoperations by Israeli troops and the 2,500-strong South Lebanon Army.   He said the militia killed three guerrillas armed with rocketpropelled grenades, bombs and personal weapons in the Hasbaya areain what appeared to be the clash that followed the Palestinianassault.   He denied Israeli troops were involved in this operation in theeastern sector of the security zone, a six- to 10-mile area justnorth of the border that Israel carved out in 1985 as a bufferagainst guerrilla forays.   The spokesman said a combined Israeli force of infantry,artillery and tanks launched a ``preventive'' attack north of thezone against guerrilla bases of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, orParty of God, near the villages of Klea and Zillaya in the morning.   He said the area has been used by Hezbollah to prepare and launchattacks on the security zone.   The raiding force, he said, detained an undetermined number ofsuspects. He reported no casualties from that raid.   Before the pullback, the Israeli force distributed leafletswarning the population against collaboration with guerrillas.   In Beirut, the Fatah-Revolutionary Council faction headed byPalestinian terrorist Abu Nidal said two of its guerrillas werekilled and a third was slightly wounded in a clash overnight withthe South Lebanon Army east of the southern port of Sidon.   A communique from the group said the clash flared at the villageof Saffarin near Jezzine, the largest Christian town in southLebanon that forms the northern tip of the security zone. Jezzine is15 miles east of Sidon, provincial capital of south Lebanon about 25miles south of Beirut.   Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh refugee camps house the bulkof the Palestinian guerrilla forces in Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
