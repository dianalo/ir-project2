The MG feedstock,delivered by Samatec was obtained from a new run of smelting experiments.The upgraded feedstock has a boron and phosphorus concentration of 2.5ppmw and 5.5 ppmw, respectively. The aluminum concentration is around60 ppmw. From this feedstock ingots of first directional crystallizationhave been obtained with a resistivity of about 0.06 Ohm x cm. Some ofthese ingots have been re-crystallized again obtaining 2 ingots of secondcrystallization with a resistivity of 0.2 Ohm x cm. Selected wafers cutin different positions along the growth axis from the first and secondcrystallization ingots are now available for epitaxial growth. 1 fig.,3 refs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
