The firm, unrelated to U.S.-based Pan American Airways, is a sole proprietorship of Reynold Anselmo. The U.S. entrepreneur is a former partner in one of the biggest Spanish-language television networks in the U.S.    The government ruling removes the major obstacle to Pan American's U.S.-U.K. service. It requires British Telecommunications PLC, Britain's main phone company, to connect U.K. subscribers to Pan American's satellite at customers' request. A British Telecom spokesman said the company doesn't oppose dealing with Pan American provided &quot;there is sufficient demand from U.K. customers&quot; for the Pan American service.    Pan American won a U.S. license last year in a Reagan Administration effort to inject some competition into the heavily regulated market for international satellite services. Intelsat, an international consortium controlled by governments, currently owns all commercial trans-Atlantic communications satellites. Breaking that monopoly, Pan American Satellite plans to launch the first private communications satellite over the Atlantic this May.    The British decision was &quot;the first crack&quot; in the general European opposition to Pan American's plans, Fred Landman, the company president, said in a telephone interview yesterday. Most European governments fear Pan American's service might take revenue from their national phone companies and so haven't granted it rights to connect with their countries. But Britain's Conservative government has been pushing phone deregulation and last month began easing restrictions on some other U.K. satellite services.    Pan American's Mr. Landman said &quot;a cross-section&quot; of British and U.S. multinationals, which he declined to identify, have expressed interest in his company's service. He expects the service, available in July, will generate up to $400 million in revenue over the satellite's scheduled 12-year life -- provided other European governments also approve the service. </TEXT></DOC>
