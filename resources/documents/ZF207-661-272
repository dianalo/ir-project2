 PC users lobbying for affordable online access to governmentinformation were badly singed early this year when the departing Reaganadministration issued a controversial proposal to block government agenciesfrom providing that access.andM;The proposal, in effect, restricted federal agencies to acting aswholesalers, selling data to private companies that in tum sell it to thepublic at a substantial profit.andP;  The agencies were also prohibited fromdeveloping their own information systems that would compete with privatesystems.andM;For private database information behemoths such as Knight-Ridder and DowJones, which had feared a plunge in profits, the proposed Revision to BudgetCircular A-130 was cause for a celebration.andP;  These companies buy govemmentdata on magnetic tapes at cheap prices, load it onto mainframes, and letsubscribers dial in-to the tune of as much as $1.5 billion a year in revenue,according to an estimate made by government information authority MatthewLesko.andM;But for the public it was an outrage.andP;  Within weeks, hundreds of protestletters flooded the Office of Management and Budget, the agency that hadissued the proposal.andP;  Everyone from farmers and librarians to patentattorneys and heads of nonprofit organizations demanded their right toinexpensive online access to government information.andP;  The commissioner of thegovernment's own Bureau of Labor Statistics registered a complaint.andP;  And morethan 40 public-interest organizations, ranging from the Consumer Federationof America to the National Education Association, fired off protests as well.andM;The letters called the govemment's electronic information policies&quot;misdirected&quot; and &quot;disturbing&quot;and those were the polite comments.andP;  In thisattempt to whittle down the federal bureaucracy by farming outresponsibilities to the private sector, the protesters said, theadministration was going too far.andP;  They claimed that this policy wouldprevent users from reaping the benefits of new technology.andP;  In an age whenour society's long-held goal of &quot;an informed populace&quot; suddenly appearedwithin reach, the govemment balked and appeared to be heading in the oppositedirection.andM;&quot;Instead of taking advantage of the technology to improve public access, theadministration's approach is going to throw up barriers,&quot; said Jaia Barrett,assistant executive director of the Association of Research Libraries.andP;  &quot;If[the proposal] had been in effect when the photocopier was invented,&quot; claimedone letter, &quot;(government agencies] would have been prohibited from sellingphotocopies to the public.&quot;andM;The coalition of PC users who sprang into action resembled the alliance of&quot;online lobbyists&quot; who last year successfully defeated a proposal by theFederal Communications Commission to raise the price of modem communications.andO;But this time the stakes were higher and the opposition was more formidable.andO;They would have to face the lobbying firepower of one of the most influentialspecial-interest organizations in Washington: the trade associationrepresenting the database companies, the Information Industry Association(IIA).andP;  THE IIA IS A POWERHOUSE OF POLITICAL CONnections and rhetoric, twovital elements of policymaking in the nation's capital.andP;  Founded in the late'60s, the association lobbies for the political interests of more than 800high-tech information companies, including publishers, database companies,telephone and telecommunications companies, and financial informationcompanies.andM;From giants like Dun andamp; Bradstreet to tiny startups, IIA members share severalgoals.andP;  One is to protect their intellectual property rights, such ascopyrights, to the information they sell.andP;  Another is to keep the govemmentout of the online information business.andM;According to the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, the IIAregisters a half-dozen individuals as lobbyists, including members of its ownstaff and hired guns at prestigious D.C.andP;  law firms.andP;  And although the IIA'slobbying budget weighs in at under $100,000-a trifle compared with that ofthe National Rifle Association or the tobacco industryits actual influenceoutstrips its size and budget, according to Marc Rotenberg, Washingtondirector of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.andP;  Rotenbergnotes that the IIA represents an industry with a 20-plus percent annualgrowth rate and a strong trade surplus.andP;  &quot;It is viewed as one of theindustries where the United States can prosper internationally,&quot; he says, &quot;amarket that people would like to see succeed.&quot;andM;Not surprisingly, economic growth is a mainstay of the IIA's arguments.andP;  Theassociation claims that govemment involvement in online publishing will scareaway private-sector investors in the electronic information market, whichcould stunt the growth of this fledgling industry.andP;  As chief IIA lobbyist KenAllen says of this pro&quot;If that happens, the public's gonna lose.&quot;andM;The IIA also claims that government electronic publishing would constitute&quot;subsidization,&quot; costing taxpayers too much and setting the stage forautocratic govemment controls.andP;  The added costs would include capital outlaysfor computers and data communications equipment much like those the privatecompanies already have and use to provide dial-up access.andM;The IIA's opponents retort, however, that these costs would be only a tinyfraction of what the govemment already spends to collect its information.andO;They argue also that govemment information traditionally has been considered&quot;a public good&quot; and paid for by tax dollars.andP;  Public-interest proponentsinsist it should be conveniently available to as many citizens as possible.andO;And they see the database companies as trying to manipulate the politicalsystem to nurture a golden goose.andM;&quot;It's a lazy way of doing business,&quot; says Rotenberg&quot;Online vendors shouldmake their money by improving on government information, not by being granteda monopoly.&quot;andP;  AT ABOUT THE TIME THE PROTEST LETTERS BEgan to arrive inWashington, two things happened to boost the PC users' chances to overtum theproposal.andP;  George Bush became President.andP;  And George Mickelson stepped intothe fray.andM;George Mickelson is the governor of South Dakota.andP;  When someone on his stafftried to get information from a Department of Agriculture database, he wastold that it would cost hundreds of dollars to obtain the data, which wasavailable online through a contractor (the Martin Marietta Corporation).andM;Shortly thereafter, Mickelson contacted his friend Senator Tom Daschle(D-South Dakota) and voiced a complaint: if taxpayers have already paid forthe USDA to compile the information, why should they have to pay again toretrieve it?andM;Mickelson's office quickly received a low-cost account on the Department ofAgriculture's database.andP;  And Mickelson's concerns began making the rounds onWashington's Capitol Hill, where they resonated with the growing discord overthe govemment's electronic information policies.andP;  Phone calls were made.andO;Hearings were planned.andM;In early April the Bush administration shelved the Reagan proposal.andP;  Yetlittle changed.andP;  Although agencies could now theoretically provide onlineaccess, they were not being encouraged to do so.andP;  The agencies had no centralcoordination or technical support to help them publish online information ina costeffective way.andM;There was no sign that the administration would depart from Reagan'seight-year legacy, which made it difficult for the public to obtain officialinformation-especially computerized information.andP;  In the mid-'80s, the Reaganadministration tried to restrict access to several government databases onthe grounds that public access to certain unclassified information, ifsearchable by computer, could compromise national security.andP;  This effortfollowed allegations that the Russians were soaking up vital technical datathrough publicly available databases.andM;The Reagan administration also claimed that computerized information was notcovered by the Freedom of Information Act of 1966, which guarantees publicaccess to most govemment records.andP;  Throughout the Reagan presidency, theadministration was accused of dragging its feet on Freedom of Information Actrequests.andP;  Critics suggested that the govemment had something to hide, suchas a record of lax enforcement of so-called liberal laws.andM;Clearly, new president or not, it seemed unlikely that the government wouldsuddenly swing open the doors, making it cheap and easy to dial up anddownload government information.andP;  But the Bush administration could notafford to continue its predecessor's steadfastness.andP;  HEARING Room 2247 OF THERayburn House Office Building is small and unspectacular, far from theglamour and glitter of the high-ceilinged Iran-Contra hearing chambers.andP;  Butthat didn't bother the standingroom-only crowd that packed the room one daylast May for the first in a series of hearings on the access question held bythe House Government Information Subcommittee.andM;Dr.andP;  Alan Westin, professor of public law and government at ColumbiaUniversity, warned the subcommittee that &quot;the United States is in danger ofbecoming an information autocracy.andP;  .  .  .  The lords of the new informationage will be the financially and technologically well-endowed.&quot; He added thattrying to fmd govemment information the old-fashioned way, by calling upagency officials and sifting through drawers of microfiche and reams ofpaper, can be about as frustrating as &quot;a game of twenty questions.andM;Also testifying was Jerry Berman of the American Civil Liberties Union, whonoted that the government's computerization agenda has a lot to do withideology.andP;  Social service agencies such as the Department of Health and HumanServices, he explained, have gotten short shrift in the rush to computerize.andO;Business-related agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission havecarried off most of the computerization funding.andP;  Berman urged that 'thegovernment make &quot;public need&quot; the basis of its information policies, and thatit seriously consider the creation of an &quot;electronic information safety net.&quot;andM;Berman also noted the sharp contrast between two cuff ent computerizationprojects that had been described earlier in the hearing.andP;  The first, a $50million system at the Securities and Exchange Commission, will hold filingssuch as corporate profit statements and ownership records.andP;  Dubbed EDGAR, thedatabase will be accessible at &quot;market rates,&quot; most likely in the $50- to$125-per-hour range, through private broker Mead Data Central, which isfunding the &quot;dissemination subsystem&quot; under a contract with the government.andO;In contrast, the Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory(TRI) will be available online directly from the govemment, at below-marketrates of $18 to $25 an hour.andP;  Mandated as part of the 1986 Superfund law,this system will contain local and regional data on chemical emissions,designed to help citizens and reporters find out exactly which chemicals havebeen released into their communities and by which companies.andP;  The EPA is alsoconsidering waiving fees and holding training programs to encourage thepublic to use the information and to help them interpret it.andM;Public-interest advocates point to TRI as a model for future govemmentinformation systems, noting that private companies can still buy TRI onmagnetic tape and resell it online.andP;  But the database companies claim thatthe govemment is already adding so many &quot;fancy enhancements&quot; to TRI thatthere would be little reason for anybody to buy a commercial version of thedata.andP;  They warn that if the government extends this precedent to otherprojects, reworking raw data for consumption by end users, it will snuff outprivate sector efforts and thereby stifle diversity and creativity.andO;Public-interest lobbyists disagree, insisting that government publicationshave always incorporated such &quot;enhancements.&quot;andM;&quot;Where the line is drawn [between raw data and useful information] is notthat clear,&quot; says Marc Rotenberg.andP;  &quot;Is punctuation value-added in a sentence?andO;Do you pay extra for capitalization? This is the kind of discussion that hasevolved.andM;&quot;The IIA has tried to dictate the terms under which a govemment agency cangive out information.andP;  That's a problem.andP;  I think the government has anobligation to provide basic and useful information to people who ask for it.&quot;andO;OTHER QUESTIONS STILL NEED ANSWERS.andP;  How much, for example, will publiconline access actually cost taxpayers, once the information is already inmachine-readable form? The IIA says the costs are high and better borne byexisting private providers.andM;&quot;The government doesn't need to reinvent the wheel every time there's a needfor a new information service,&quot; says IIA lobbyist Ron Plesser.andP;  &quot;We don'twant the govemment to be a subsidized database for the big corporate users orfor the Japanese.&quot;andM;Also, since some government databases are imagebased rather thancharacter-based, how win people who lack sophisticated display equipmentaccess the data? Should users be able to download entire databases so thatthey can analyze the data offline, or should they be permitted simply tosearch through the information online? If the government scales usage feesaccording to certain criteria, who will decide who qualifies for whichcategories?andM;&quot;These decisions require a case-by-case approach,&quot; says the IIA's Ken Allen.andO;&quot;Each agency must be responsible for its own policies.&quot;andM;Public-interest advocates are opposed to a caseby-case approach.andP;  They insistthat the &quot;citizen empowerment&quot; model apply across the board, through mandatedguidelines for all federal databases.andM;Although Congress is scheduled to debate the online access issue this year,it's likely that it will commission more experiments like the EPA's ToxicRelease Inventory database rather than impose acrossthe-board accessrequirements.andP;  At any rate, the Bush administration seems to have gotten themessage from the blizzard of protest this spring.andP;  In early June, theadministration announced its intention to overhaul its regulations on onlineinformation access, incorporating many of the letter writers' suggestions anddemands.andM;&quot;It's a dramatic flip-flop .andP;  .  .  a more balanced approach,&quot; says JaiaBarrett, &quot;but I don't think we can now assume everything's going to be OK.andO;The new proposal recognizes that govemment information in all formats is apublic asset.andP;  But we need these principles fixed in law so the situationdoesn't flip-flop again when the personalities change.&quot;andM;The tide seems to be turning in favor of affordable online access togovernment information.andP;  The IIA, realizing that the cards are stackedagainst it, is backing off, according to the ACLU's Berman.andP;  &quot;They tookadvantage of the Reagan momentum,&quot; Berman says, &quot;and they had their way.andP;  Butnow they can see that they can't fight the online access movement anymore.andO;They're fighting apple pie.&quot;andM;The Government Has the FactsandM;Want to adopt a wild buff o get a photograph of your favorite glacier? Needthe latest details about Americans imprisoned in foreign countries? Curiousto see how the crude you've struck in your backyard stacks up against thecompetition from Saudi Arabia?andM;The U.S.andP;  govermnent maintains over 400 computerized databases, according toInformation USA, which publishes the Federal Database Finder (available for$125 from Information USA, P.0.andP;  Box 15700, Chevy Chase, Md.andP;  20815;301-657-1200).andP;  Many of these databases are also available online throughcommercial database broken.andP;  Others, containing classified or protectedinformation such as Social Security numbers or household incomes, areavailable for searches only through U.S.andP;  agency personnel.andM;Financial, technical, and bibliographic researchers willing to spend a fewhundred dollars for the facts they need can get catalog from the majorbrokers: KnightRidder's Dialog Information Services (800-334-2564), Mead DataCentral (800-2274908), and BRS Information Technologies (800468-0908).andM;Charges for information can be steep.andP;  Facts about water resources from theDepartment of the Interior, for example, can cost $84 an hour (not includingtelecommunications charges); occupational safety data from the NationalInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health costs $66 an hour.andP;  At $30 anhour, the ERIC educational resources database from the Department ofEducation seems a real bargain.andM;The National Library of Medicine's MEDLARS is available for about $20 anhour.andP;  This collection includes citations and abstracts from more than 5million medical journal articles.andP;  Subscriptions are available directly fromthe National Library of Medicine (8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Md.andP;  20894;800-638-8480), and even nonsubscribers can request searches at more than2,000 universities and hospitals across the country.andM;Information USA recommends that researcher on a tight budget get helpdirectly from the U.S.andP;  agency that produces the relevant database (contactthe Federal Information Center in a major city near you).andP;  Often, agencypersonnel can obtain the information at a cheaper rate and mail theresearcher the results of the search.andP;  Teachers and other people who needinformation for noncommercial uses may be able to get the data for free.andM;Alternatively, researchers can try talking a local university or library intobuying a copy of a specific database on magnetic tape or diskette.andP;  Pricesrange from less than a hundred dollars to thousands, depending on thedatabase.andP;  Some of the largest informationgenerating agencies, such as theBureau of the Census, have also started to sell information on optical disc,in CD-ROM format.andM;Access to a few databases is free, except for the cost of a long-distancemodem call.andP;  These information sources are typically highly specialized andoften turn out to be PC-based bulletin board systems (BBSs) cultivated byonline enthusiasts in the government.andP;  Unfortunately, the governmentpublishes no official listing of these BBSs.andP;  Reseuchen can get an informalfisting, however, from the Department of Commerce's Economic Bulletin Board(202377-3870; available 24 hours a day; 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity).andM;Researcher will find information that ranges from the mundane to the exotic:meteorological data, for example, from the National Oceanographic andAtmospheric Administration's Climate Assessment Bulletin Board (voiceinformation is available at 301-7638071), and the latest figures on housingstarts, textile exports, and lumber consumption from the Department ofCommerce's Economic Bulletin Board.andP;  In the near future, some of thebetter-funded and more popular databases may join these fledgling BBSs in thefree-access column.andP;  -DLM  Loopholes in the Freedom of Information ActandM;'.&quot;Fundamental to our way of life is the belief that when information .andP;  .  .andO;is systematically withheld by those in power, the people soon become ignorantof their own affairs, distrustful of those who manage then; and eventuallyincapable of determining their own destinies.&quot;andM;These words were uttered not by founding father James Madison, whoimmortalized a similar quote in 1822, but by President Richard Milhous Nixonexactly 150 years later.andM;Through two centuries of American political evolution, the concept of thepublic's &quot;right to know&quot; has remained a cornerstone of our constitutionaldemocracy.andP;  But today it is under the gun, according to lobbyists for bothpublic and private interests.andP;  These advocates, in a rare show of politicalagreement, accuse recent conservative administrations of usingcomputerization as an excuse to flout information-access laws and revert tothe days of government secrecy.andM;Each year about 500,000 citizen requests for government information aresubmitted under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which guaranteespublic access to federal records except for national security and othersensitive data.andP;  Since the act's passage, in 1966, FOIA requests have playeda major role in exposing government scandals like the Iran-Contra affair,harassment of public figures like Martin Luther King, and lax enforcement oflaws like the Superfund for toxic waste cleanup.andP;  The FOIA has also enabledmany individuals to obtain the contents of their FBI files.andM;In the past few years, the government has refused-or delayed interminably-agrowing number of FOIA requests on the grounds that the act does not apply tocomputerized records, or that retrieving the information would require costlycomputer programming.andP;  In some cases agencies have supplied the requestedinformation in unwieldy printouts rather than on diskette-the functionalequivalent of paying off a $1,000 debt with unrolled pennies.andP;  In a fewextreme situations, agencies have informed requesters that their desiredinformation &quot;does not exist,&quot; claiming that the computerized information doesnot constitute a &quot;record&quot; as defined by the &quot;right to know&quot; law, which waslast rewritten in 1974.andM;In short, many FOIA requesters are finding that &quot;information once availablehas gone down the black hole of a government computer,&quot; as the ACLU's JerryBerman put it at a recent Congressional hearing.andP;  Some have taken theirbaffles to the Supreme Court and to Congress, with mixed results.andP;  What theywant is a complete rewrite of the Freedom of Information Act to apply the oldprinciples to the new technology.andP;  One bill to do just that has already beenintroduced in the current session of Congress by Representative Bob Wise(D-West Virginia).andM;To let your elected representatives know how you feel about this issue, writeto them in care of the U.S.andP;  Senate, Washington, D.C.andP;  20510, or the U.S.andO;House of Representatives, Washington, D.C.andP;  20515.andP;  -DLM</TEXT></DOC>
