 I don'tconsider that the review matched the otherwise high standards set by PC Useras a quality publication offering accurate and informative comment on eventswithin the computer industry.andM;The reviewer, Marc Joffe, has levelled criticism at the product in a numberof areas which I feel is unwarranted and which may mislead readers as to thequality and usefulness of the product.andP;  This indicates perhaps that thereviewer didn't properly understand the product under review.andM;In particular the reviewer cites the security system as 'Probably the mostirritating aspect of Lamaura,' and states that the use of DOS environmentvariables 'adds to the misery.'andP;  He then states that 'all of this might workon a LAN, but it's a pain on a stand-alone machine.'andP;  As is clearly stated inthe manual, these features aren't present in the single-user version.andO;Personally, I'm very much in favour of the security system and needless tosay I find it hard to believe the reviewer's claims that he wouldn't beworried by the prospect of junior programmers wreaking havoc with his datastructures! a system might be able to perform such a task.andP;  Also, the userprogram can only be used to define tables and can't be used as stated, tocreate them.andM;Although a very subjective matter, I would contend that the system is 'userfriendly', and would question what the reviewer considers to be 'standard leyassignments.'andP;  I find the mnemonic keystroke assignments perfectly acceptableunder the circumstances.andM;Furthermore the reviewer implies that a data dictionary ought toautomatically correct design flaws.andP;  I'd be interested to hear an explanationof how a system might be able to perform such a task.andP;  The Lamaura DataDictionary does maintain full referential integrity, a feature not alwaysfound in data dictionaries, but no mention is made of this fact.andM;Finally, the data dictionary function contained within both UI Programmer andFoxView can't perform in the manner that the Lamaura Data Dictionary does.andO;The fact that Nantucket UK markets both the Lamaura Data Dictionary and UIProgrammer would suggest that Nantucket doesn't view the two products ascompetition for each other.andM;Justifiable criticism of a product is one thing, but I don't feel that thereview given to the product was representative.andP;  Tony Whitter ManagingDirector Comcare ManchesterandM;DICTIONARYandM;DISAGREEMENTSandM;I was interested to read the review of the Lamaura Data Dictionary in issue125, but feel that the review was misleading at best.andM;Firstly, I must disagree with Mr Joffee about the user interface.andP;  I wasstruck by how pleasant the user interface was when I first started thepackage up.andP;  The Data Dictionary is written in Clipper and is aimed at theClipper/dBase market.andP;  As such, the keystrokes, apart from being the de factostandard in PC applications, are second nature to Clipper/dBase programmers.andM;Mr Joffe also makes a point about the security system being acceptable for aLAN environment but not in a single-user environment.andP;  This is just one ofthe points which indicates that the review was poorly researched as thesingle-user version has no security system.andM;Lastly, I'm surprised that Mr Joffe compares the Lamaura Data Dictionary tothe data dictionary in the UI Programmer.andP;  The data dictionary in the UIProgrammer is similar to the Lamaura Data Dictionary in name only as thepurpose of each is significantly different.andM;Overall, I'm surprised that PC User would print such an inaccurate review andI'm alarmed at the damage which will result to a product which addresses areal need in the Clipper/dBase language.andP;  For such a product I'd have likedto have seen a significantly longer and more accurate review.andP;  Guy SmithCapella Software NottinghamandM;Marc Joffee replies:  The letter writers have one valid point: I was NOTaware that I was reviewing a multi-user version as the disks aren't labelledas such.andP;  Unfortunately, I operated on the assumption that I was working withthe single-user version, and, as a result, unduly criticized the package'ssecurity system.andM;As far as the user interface is concerned, I gave a concrete example in thereview, ie F2 is frequently used in situations that most programs reserve forthe Enter key.andP;  The more substantive criticism, that neither screen promptsnor a keyboard template are provided go unanswered.andM;I stand by the comparison to Foxview and UI Programmer.andP;  As I stated in thereview, both of these programs contain a Data Dictionary that does most ofwhat Lamaura does (I don't see this denied anywhere in the letters).andP;  Inaddition, they provide applications generators and screen painters.andP;  I wouldfind it difficult, if not impossible, to imagine a development team usingboth Lamaura and either Foxview or UI.andP;  I think the fact that Nantucketmarkets both UI and Lamaura is immaterial.andP;  Lotus markets both 1-2-3 andSymphony, but that doesn't imply that users should consider using both.andM;I'm criticized for stating that the Data Dictionary doesn't perform databasedesign nor catch design flaws.andP;  I felt it was necessary to include thiscomment, not to demean the package, but to make users aware of what it doesand doesn't do.andM;AMSTRAD...ARE YOUandM;SERIOUS?andM;Amstrad computers and especially the PC2286/PC2386 models have been thesugject of much publicity over the last year and I'd like to relate my ownpersonal experiences.andM;Far from being anti-Amstrad, I've previously owned a PC1512 and a PC1640 withno significant problems.andP;  This led me to choose a PC22386 when looking for apowerful PC.andM;Having heard rumours of hard disk problems, I waited until these problemswere admitted and fixed.andP;  This also happened to coincide with a large pricecut, so I went out and bought a PC2386.andP;  The dealer assured me that it wasthe fixed version.andM;Firstly, I had to change the monitor due to blank spots on it, then I foundthe floppy disk drive couldn't read or write 1.44Mb floppy disks.andP;  The entiresystem was replaced by the dealer at which point I noticed the new system wasdifferent.andM;I'd initially been supplied with the model that had a fault in the hard diskcontroller.andP;  However, the replacement seemed to be satisfactory although oneof the expansion slots was now used up by the plug-in, Western Digital diskcontroller card.andM;Shortly afterwards, the hard disk failed to boot up and gave 'not ready'errors.andP;  I called Dictaphone (who spend their time in swapping over failedAmstrads for new ones).andP;  This also started me thinking about what exactly'new' meant.andM;However, on this occasion, fiddling with the cables fixed the problem and Icontinued for another month when it happened again.andP;  The dealer changed thehard disk drive over for another one and my PC was once more operational.andM;Subsequently, I had numerous data errors on disk which I suspected were dueto a defective low-level format.andP;  Amstrad refused to advise me on how torenew the low-level format.andM;Using the Spinrite II product cured all my hard disk data problems, I now hada working system; but was it new?andP;  With Amstrad recalling all those systemsand Dictaphone replacing other faulty ones, what exactly is a new system?andM;I strongly object to paying the full price for a computer if it contains usedparts, especially hard disk drives, since these do wear out and every singleminute of use is one minute nearer their inevitable demise.andM;Hard disks can be damaged by careless knocks and also by not parking theheads before each power off.andP;  This wouldn't concern me but for the fact thatit's highly probable that I've bought a used computer from Amstrad.andM;Amstrad has answered this with various carefully worded phrases such as 'nofaulty parts have been reissued' and 'all units are sent from the warehousewith new drives'.andP;  This is being economical with the truth and the companyhas NOT stated that 'no-one has been supplied with a used system'.andM;Amstrad had better decide whether it's a serious computer manufacturer ornot.andP;  If so, it must provide information on its systems openly and exerciseproper quality control and, of course, sell only new computers.andM;Finally, I'd like to mention the delays with OS/2.andP;  This clearly indicatespoor IBM AT compatibility and Amstrad has only just released version 1.1 at atime when it will shortly become obsolete in the shadow of the improved 1.2version.andP;  Peter A Toogood Horsham SussexandM;Amstrad replies: Naturally we regret that Mr Toogood was supplied in thefirst instance with a PC 2386 model from the older batch which wasn't fittedwith the Western Digital controller.andP;  We note, though, that the service andsupport facility afforded by Dictaphone eventually diagnosed any subsequentdifficulties and that Mr Toogood now has a machine, running to specification,without having had to resort to returning the machine to the supplyingdealership -- as most other manufacturers require the customer to do.andP;  Ouron-site service, of course, obviates any likelihood of damage in transit.andM;We believe that the supply of on-site maintenance is an integral part ofAmstrad's proper and professional approach to selling PCs.andP;  Mr Toogood'sexperience is not a typical one, but his particular difficulties have beenaddressed and resolved by the proper service agency.andM;So far as Microsoft OS/2 is concerned, we note that Amstrad shipped initialcopies of the product in the third quarter of 1989.andP;  No difficulties incompatibility were encountered in the port.andP;  This version is likely to remaincurrent at least until the third quarter of this year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
