In the bearish exception, the only big exchange to close lower was Tokyo, after a short-lived opening jump. The U.S. dollar's slump in currency dealings to a new post-World War II low against the yen sparked profit-taking in the heavy industry, marine transportation and financial sectors, while export-led electrical stocks managed to close mixed.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks, which fell 109.53 points Monday, dropped 79.55 to 22846.73. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index fell 0.84 to 1844.55. First section volume was estimated at 480 million shares, up from 300 million a day earlier.    In early trading Wednesday in Tokyo, stock prices rebounded. The Nikkei index rose 29.42 to 22876.15 at the end of the morning session.    One trader described comparatively small losses on the export side Tuesday as further signs Japanese investors are reacting favorably to &quot;rationalization&quot; measures against the strong yen's effects. But a senior trader for a Japanese securities house said, &quot;The recent rise in electrical makers was due to foreign buying, and the absence of steeper losses Tuesday only shows such investors don't want to sell while the yen is moving higher.&quot; He emphasized the favorable foreign exchange trend for these market participants.    Among export-led electricals, Alps, a consumer electronic parts maker, rose 40 points to 1,730 ($13.53). Oki Electric Industry rose 3 to 730. But Sony fell 100 to 4,850 on currency-induced profit-taking. Chip maker Kyocera dropped 20 to 5,000.    Toyota fell 20 to 1,790. But Nissan Motor rose 10 to 766 on bargain hunting and investor beliefs in improving fundamentals; likewise, Honda rose 20 to 1,280.    In heavy industry issues with a shipbuilding emphasis, Kawasaki Heavy Industry eased 5 to 255.    Among financial shares, non-life insurance stocks were sold. Taisho Marine fell 10 to 1,040. Banks were weaker. Mitsubishi Bank slipped 10 to 2,920. Dai-Ichi Kangyo eased 10 to 2,950.    Certain specialty steel shares contradicted the market trend on the instigation of big brokerage houses. Tokyo Steel soared 390 to 3,350, on speculation about an increase in demand for its products under an expanding domestic economy.    The bearish performance of Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone shares also chilled trading. NTandamp;T has served as a sentiment weather vane for the market lately, portending, according to some observers, whether general share prices can or can't be primed for a rally. NTandamp;T slipped 10,000 to 2.32 million yen a share.    Japan Air Lines rose 500 to 14,400, one day after the government set a discounted price of 13,400 yen a share on slightly more than 48 million additional JAL shares being sold to the public this week.    London share prices finished higher but below their best levels in active trading, bolstered by Wall Street gains and cautious optimism that U.K. equities are underpriced at current levels.    The Financial Times 30-share index was up 19.6 points at 1332.0. Volume jumped to 667.7 million shares from 338.4 million shares a day earlier. The 100-share index was up 17.4 at 1670.0.    Equities also got a boost from the recent pickup in takeover activity, dealers said, which seems to confirm that current share prices are a good value and likely to move higher in coming weeks. Britoil, facing rival bids by British Petroleum and Atlantic Richfield, was bid up 21 pence to 392 ($7.21) ahead of Wednesday's expiration of BP's 300-pence-a-share tender offer. BP has said it would revise its offer to top Arco's bid of 350 pence a share. One analyst said bidding for Britoil could go as high as 450 pence.    Also in the oil sector, Premier Consolidated Oilfields said it holds a 4.95% stake in Tricentrol, a British oil and gas company that is the target of a hostile takeover bid from the U.K. unit of France's Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine. Premier wouldn't say whether it is considering a takeover bid for Tricentrol. But one analyst noted Premier wasn't obligated to announce its holding of less than 5% and thus was more likely &quot;advertising&quot; its stake to see what buying interest it might draw. Tricentrol rose 6 to 172. But a sharp drop in crude oil prices depressed shares of some oil companies involved in exploration and production, an analyst said.    In Frankfurt, share prices ended broadly higher in lively trading, boosted by the day-earlier rally on Wall Street, the dollar's slight rise in currency dealings, and oil prices' sharp drop after the end of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting. The fall in oil prices was viewed as keeping inflation down and perhaps easing pressure on the dollar.    Chemical shares paced the market on hopes that lower oil prices will improve the industry's profit margins. Bayer surged 9.40 marks to 266.40 marks ($163.43), Hoechst climbed 8.40 to 261 and BASF was up 8 to 258.40.    Auto stocks also were significantly higher, with Bayerische Motoren Werke surging 22 to 456, Daimler-Benz rising 10 to 612 and Volkswagen gaining 4.70 to 226.80.    Electronics group Siemens advanced 9 to 376.50. Among steel and machinery issues, Mannesmann soared 8.50, or 8%, to 115, and Thyssen moved ahead 5.50 to 109.50. MAN and Hoesch added 2.50 each to 129 and 97.50, respectively. But Kloeckner Humboldt-Deutz, reeling from heavy losses in its agricultural machinery lines, fell 2 to 79.    Stocks also closed higher in Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Milan, and ended mixed in Brussels, where the market sought a direction amid the political uncertainty that followed last Sunday's general election.    Share prices closed higher in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Manila.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                      % This                                 Dec 14    Dec 11      Year U.S. ........................... 225.6     219.3     - 1.1 Britain ........................ 496.7     495.5     - 0.2 Canada ......................... 353.7     345.4     + 6.2 Japan ......................... 1091.9    1100.3     +15.5 France ......................... 288.9     283.8     -29.2 Germany ........................ 157.5     156.8     -39.4 Hong Kong ..................... 1450.5    1411.7     - 8.5 Switzerland .................... 138.4     138.4     -31.1 Australia ...................... 233.3     232.8     -11.6 World index .................... 403.7     398.5     +13.2</TEXT></DOC>
