<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-26-0299 </DOCNO><TEXT>We describe the performance of the Intelligent Gateway Processor (ITP)as a technical and cost-effective tool for inter-connectivity among heterogeneousresources on geographically distributed networks. The IGP software hasbeen evaluated by several federal agencies and is now operational onover 100 UNIX-based computers from 14 different vendors in the NATO countriesand in the United States. We then discuss the IGP capabilities, especiallythe flexibility and extensibility of the table-driven, interpreter-basedsystem that permits the development of a unified approach to the managementof scientific and technological information. This includes the automatedinteractive access to the large bibliographic databases worldwide, theextraction of relevant sets, compilation into a neutral data exchangeformat, and trend analysis of emerging technologies by statistical meansand time-resolved pattern recognition. The expanding availability ofnumeric factual databases in science and engineering now also makes itpossible to evaluate the leading Chemical Information Management Systems(CIMS) which provide specialized interfaces to the chemical bibliographiesand the nomenclature and structures of substances. We review four ofthe powerful and sophisticated commercially available CIMS in anticipationof their integration with gateway technology: MACCS and DATACCS fromMolecular Design Limited in San Leandro, California, the DARC systemfrom Telesystemes Questel in Paris, France, and the CENTRUM interfacefor the machine-aided preparation of chemical reports and graphics fromPolygen Corporation in Waltham, Massachusetts. The IGP software had beenunder development since 1975 by the Technology Information Systems Program(TISP) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and is now licensedto industry. 51 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
