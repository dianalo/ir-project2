The commentators have askedthe Department to take action which would prevent, with respect to a specifictransaction, both participation in a Department program and receipt ofdrawback.In view of the comments that the Department has received with regard tothe drawback concerns, the public is invited to submit comments generallyon this issue. Comments are specifically invited on the economic and programmaticimpact, if any, on exports of U.S. agricultural commodities and the Department'sexport programs: (1) Of the current system under which exports under theseprograms may benefit from duty drawback; and (2) if program participantswere required to agree, as a condition of program participation, that theywould not claim duty drawback with respect to U.S. agricultural exportsunder these programs. The Department also invites comments with respectto the extent that duty drawback is now being claimed on exports made underthe above programs.The proposed revision would apply to the following export programs:(1) 7 CFR Part 17-Sales of Agricultural Commodities Made Available UnderTitle I of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954,as amended.(2) 7 CFR Part 1493-Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Export Credit GuaranteeProgram (GSM-102) and CCC Intermediate Export Credit Guarantee Program(GSM-103).(3) Export Enhancement Program (EEP).(4) Sunflower Oil Assistance Program (SOAP).(5) Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP).Each person submitting suggestions or comments is requested to includehis/her name and address and give reasons for the comments or suggestions.Copies of all written communications will be available for examinationby interested persons in Room 4503, South Building, U.S. Department ofAgriculture during regular business hours.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, on December 2, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard E.
