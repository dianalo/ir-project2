(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Hand scanners go head-to-head: Upgrades, new models enter fieldandM;More gray levels, better editingandM;By Mary Jane WestlandandM;A year ago, we reviewed two pioneering hand-held scanners for the Macintosh:LightningScan from Thunderware Inc. and ScanMan from Logitech Inc.andP;  Both ofthese scanners have been upgraded to capture more gray levels, and both haveimproved editing features.andP;  There also are several newer entries in thehand-held scanner market, including The Complete P.C.andP;  Inc.'s The CompleteHalf-Page Scanner/400 and three models from Marstek Inc., the Mars 105, 128and 800.andM;LightningScan 400.andP;  Like the other hand-held scanners reviewed here,LightningScan 400 from Thunderware is a SCSI device.andP;  Scanning is done toRAM, so the more memory you have, the larger the image you'll be able tocapture.andM;All the scanners we looked at have convenient external SCSI ID settings, butonly the LightningScan has external termination as well.andP;  Externaltermination makes SCSI chain problems easier to deal with.andM;LightningScan's scanning software consists of an application, ThunderWorks,and a desk accessory, LightningScan, which differ slightly in capabilities.andO;The DA does not allow printing and includes no editing tools, but it doestrue-gray conversion and can flip or rotate selections.andM;Except for the Mars 128 scanner, all the units reviewed scan a 4-inch-widestrip, with scan length limited by available RAM.andP;  Resolution choices forthese range from 100 to 400 dpi, and scan modes are line art and three graydither patterns.andP;  These dithers are defined by a 6-by-6-pixel matrix and canbe converted to true grays.andM;With its new Join feature, ThunderWorks also can splice two scanned stripstogether for a final image wider than 4 inches.andP;  All settings for resolution,scan mode and brightness are made on the scan head and are automaticallypolled by the scanning software.andP;  This allows you to change settings inmidscan for special effects.andM;As with all these scanners, the unit is aligned over the artwork by lookingthrough a window on the scanner head and squaring up an edge with the artworkbelow.andP;  The LightningScan package includes SnapGuide, a two-part gadget thatallows you to align its straight edge with a vertical guideline on youroriginal for a straighter, squarer scan.andP;  The addition of rear wheels alsomakes pulling in a straight line easier than with the original LightningScan.andM;Scanning speed for all the scanners ranged from about 3 inches per second at100 dpi to 0.7 inches per second at 400 dpi.andP;  LightningScan includes ascan-speed indicator light on the top of the scan head that flickers whenyou're pulling too fast to accurately capture an image.andP;  In most cases, youget sufficient warning to slow down before losing data.andM;While you're scanning, an on-screen gauge indicates how much RAM remains.andP;  Ifyou're going to use the Join feature, neither of the two scans should takemore than half the RAM available.andM;ThunderWorks includes a full range of editing tools.andP;  Dithered gray imagescan be converted to 37 levels of true-gray information and edited at 256levels of gray.andP;  Grays for editing are chosen from a palette or picked upfrom the image itself.andP;  Brightness, contrast and gamma curve can be adjustedin the gray-map editor.andP;  There are also 13 filters for image enhancement.andM;Editing can be done in any view, from 25 percent to 800 percent.andO;Unfortunately, you cannot edit in one view and watch your progress inanother.andM;Because it allows you to capture images wider than 4 inches, the Join commandis essential for optical character recognition work.andP;  When joining scans, theright-hand image can be moved and stretched with special tools (an importantfeature, since it's nearly impossible to produce perfectly parallel scans).andM;ThunderWorks saves and opens a wide range of formats.andP;  You also can open morethan one document at a time.andM;The documentation includes a good tutorial, with a photograph forexperimenting with gray-scale scanning and a good discussion of gray-scaleediting and dither options.andP;  Technical support at Thunderware has always beenhelpful.andM;ScanMan Model 32.andP;  Logitech has upgraded its ScanMan by adding rear wheelsand the capability to capture 32 levels of true-gray information.andP;  ScanMannow also does gray-scale editing, and the software has been improvedtremendously.andM;Software consists of a Startup document (INIT), ScanMan Driver, andapplication and DA versions of the ScanMan software.andP;  You can scan and editfrom either the application or the DA, but the DA version will not print.andO;The DA also will not work with MultiFinder; it requires more RAM thanMultiFinder normally allots to DAs.andM;Resolution (100 to 400 dpi), mode (line art or three dithers) and brightnessare set on the scan head.andP;  A scan-direction feature lets you scan from top tobottom, left to right or right to left without having to rotate the imageafter scanning.andM;Resolution and brightness are polled automatically by the scanning software.andO;Scan Line Art and Scan Gray are separate commands that yield very differentresults.andP;  Some interesting special effects can be achieved by mixing andmatching these modes.andP;  Scan Gray with line-art mode, for instance, yields ahigh-contrast image rendered in gray and white that can be manipulated withthe gray-scale editing tools.andP;  A 32-level, true-gray image results when adither pattern is chosen and the Scan Gray command is used.andP;  Dithered imagescan be obtained with a dither mode and the Scan Line Art command.andM;Alignment of ScanMan is the same as for LightningScan.andP;  ScanMan does notinclude a gadget like SnapGuide, but its scan head has been redesigned with aflatter edge to allow you to pull against a user-supplied straight edge.andM;A scanning-speed indicator light on top of the scanner works much likeLightningScan's.andP;  In addition, ScanMan has an on-screen gauge for monitoringthe RAM available to complete a scan.andM;Basic editing tools are included in a tear-off menu.andP;  The paintbrush has 30brush shapes and 32 true or dithered grays.andP;  Brightness and contrast can beadjusted on gray-scale images after they've been scanned.andP;  Editing can bedone in any view, from 25 percent to 800 percent.andM;(At press time, Logitech announced Version 2.1 of the ScanMan software, whichis said to include scan &quot;stitching&quot; capabilities similar to ThunderWorks'Join command as well as improved editing tools.)andM;ScanMan saves and opens MacPaint, PICT and TIFF formats, but only onedocument can be open at a time.andM;The documentation is excellent.andP;  It has detailed explanations and power-usertips.andM;Half-Page Scanner/400.andP;  The Complete P.C.'s The Complete Half-PageScanner/400 (CHPS/400) was first released for the IBM PC, and unfortunatelythe software shows it.andP;  Everything functions reliably, but several featuresthat Macintosh users have grown to expect are missing.andP;  However, the unitworks with both Macs and PCs; if you buy either unit, you can upgrade it towork with the other computer.andM;The unit's SCSI ID is set externally.andP;  Termination is internal, however, andonly one SCSI port is provided, so the scanner must be the last device inyour SCSI chain.andP;  This could be a problem if you have other internallyterminated SCSI devices.andM;CHPS includes an INIT that serves as a driver and a scanning application,SmartScan.andP;  There is no DA version of SmartScan.andM;Scan length is adjustable up to 14 inches, with total image size limited byavailable RAM.andP;  Resolution (200, 300 or 400 dpi) and brightness are set onthe scan head.andP;  Scan modes are line art or three halftone dithers.andP;  Halftonescan be converted to four, 16 or 256 true grays after scanning, and resolutionalso can be reduced during gray-scale conversion.andP;  Resolution reductionincreases image processing and printing speeds and reduces the size ofgray-scale images displayed on the screen while not affecting the size of theprinted version of the image.andP;  There's also a scaling feature that willresize the image by a percentage or by dimension.andM;The resolution setting on the scan head and in SmartScan must match, or CHPSwill not work.andP;  SmartScan automatically polls the hardware for brightness andmode; we wish it also polled for resolution.andM;With CHPS, image size must be defined before scanning.andP;  However, there is nofeedback on required vs.andP;  available RAM while you're setting up the scansize.andP;  Once the scan size and resolution are defined, SmartScan calculatesthe amount of RAM needed.andP;  If there is insufficient RAM, you get an errormessage but no clue as to what size or resolution scan would fit intoavailable RAM.andM;CHPS has a fairly flat edge on the scan head, which makes it possible to usea thick object such as a book to aid in scanning straight.andP;  An extra rollerin the back of the scanner also helps.andM;There's a scanning-speed indicator on the SCSI interface, but it doesn't seemto give as much warning of potential data loss as LightningScan's andScanMan's, making it more difficult to recover in midscan.andM;SmartScan's editing tools and features are rudimentary at best.andP;  There is notool palette with icons; rather, the tools are simply named in a menu, andthe keyboard shortcuts are decidedly non-mnemonic.andP;  Editing tools work onlyin line-art mode.andM;For editing gray-scale images, there are five filters: Smooth, Lighten,Darken, Detect Edges and Sharpen.andP;  Brightness can be adjusted only via thefilters, and contrast and gamma curve cannot be adjusted at all.andM;There are three views: Fit in Window, Dot for Dot and Fat Bits.andP;  No line-artmode editing can be done in Fit in Window.andP;  All the line-art editing toolsand gray filters work in Dot for Dot view.andP;  Only the pencil works in FatBits, and Fat Bits view is not available in gray-scale mode.andP;  You can openmultiple views of the same document, and editing done in one window canusually be viewed in another by forcing that window to refresh.andM;SmartScan saves in all the major file formats but opens only PICT and TIFFfiles.andM;We found technical support hard to reach, but the company did return our calland attempted to solve problems we had converting dithered scans to grayscale.andP;  The Complete P.C.andP;  also has a fax line and a 24-hour bulletin boardfor tech support.andM;Mars 105.andP;  The Mars 105, 128 and 800 from Marstek are all driven by theScanLink SCSI interface and software.andP;  Mac and IBM PC interfaces for thesescanners can be purchased separately.andP;  The Mac versions of these unitsinclude the scanner, SCSI interface, Marstek scanning software and DigitalDarkroom.andM;The ScanLink software that drives these scanners has been ported from the PCplatform, and it shows in the worst way.andP;  There is not a single keyboardshortcut, the Delete key doesn't function as the Clear command, Undo isn'talways enabled, Paste doesn't work the way it does in other Macintoshprograms, and the software's just plain ugly.andP;  The Marstek hardware, on theother hand, looks like it's been carefully designed and manufactured.andO;Thankfully, Silicon Beach Software's Digital Darkroom, an excellent product,serves as the image-editing software.andM;The Mars 105's scanning modes are the same as those of the other scannerswe've looked at: line art or three dithered gray patterns for 16 ditheredlevels of gray.andP;  ScanLink cannot convert dithered gray information to truegray scale.andP;  Resolution choices are 200, 300 or 400 dpi.andM;Resolution, scan mode and brightness are set on the scan head.andP;  However, thesoftware requires you to manually poll the scan resolution before scanning.andO;If you then change the resolution on the scan head, the software will crash.andO;You also have to set the scan width and length before scanning, and youcannot stop before you've reached the full length.andM;Alignment of the scanner with the original is similar to that of the otherscanners mentioned.andP;  While Mars 105 ships with a metal scanner guide thatfits into a groove in the scan head, we found a book to be more reliable.andM;The Mars 105 has no scanning-speed indicator to warn you of an impending dataoverflow and consequent image distortion.andP;  Even worse, while the scanningspeeds noted in the Mars specifications matched those of the other scanners,only rarely were we able to pull the scanner slowly enough to avoid overflowdistortions.andM;ScanLink includes no editing tools.andP;  Scan manipulations are limited to thestandard Cut, Copy, Paste, Rotate, and vertical and horizontal flip.andO;However, Paste works only if you first have a target area selected.andP;  If theimage on the Clipboard is of a different aspect ratio than the target area,it will be distorted to fit into the target.andP;  And if the pasted image isn'tpositioned correctly, you can't move it.andP;  You cannot Undo the Rotate command.andM;Views include Fat Bits, Full Size and Actual Size.andP;  Zoom In goes to a maximumof 800 percent (the same as Fat Bits), and Zoom Out goes to 6.25 percent.andO;Editing can be done only in Full Size view.andM;ScanLink's manual claims that it saves in MacPaint, PICT, TIFF, EncapsulatedPostScript and PostScript formats.andP;  However, we were unsuccessful at savingin either MacPaint or EPS formats.andP;  The manual also claims that ScanLink canopen files of any type, but we could open only TIFF files.andM;ScanLink's documentation is poorly written.andP;  Explanations of important setupsteps are skimpy, and too much is left for users to figure out on their own.andO;There are even several serious errors.andP;  We were able to reach tech support,but while the company was aware of the bugs we reported and said they werebeing worked on, it could offer no work-arounds.andM;Mars 128.andP;  The Mars 128 uses the same SCSI interface and software as the Mars105, but Mars 128 can scan images up to 5 inches wide.andP;  However, there is abug that consistently causes a one-eighth-inch black stripe to appear downthe right edge of any image scanned at full width, effectively reducing thefull scan width to 4.85 inches.andP;  The Mars 128 is also significantly harder tohold because of its extra width.andM;Mars 800.andP;  The Mars 800 uses the same SCSI interface and software as theother Marstek models.andP;  It has essentially the same scan head as the Mars 105with some electronics added to boost scanning resolution and the number ofdither patterns available.andP;  DIP switches on the bottom of the scanner can beset to choose between groups of resolutions: 100 to 400 dpi or 500 to 800dpi.andP;  Once the resolution group is chosen, the actual resolution is set onthe side of the scan head.andP;  Two other DIP switches set one of four dithermatrices.andP;  The dither pattern is then chosen with the mode switch on the sideof the scanner.andP;  Twelve different dithers are available, with up to 64dithered gray levels.andP;  Another DIP switch allows you to set the scanner toscan in inverse mode, rendering a negative of the original image.andP;  The sameone-eighth-inch black stripe that we got with the Mars 128 appeared down theright side of each of our full-width, 4-inch-wide scans with the Mars 800.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Thunderware and Logitech have improved their hand-held scannersto the point where they are several lengths ahead of the others in the race.andO;With its just-released new software, ScanMan catches up to LightningScan inthe only areas in which it lagged behind: image-editing features and thecapability to join scans.andP;  Both companies also provide excellent support.andO;Image quality on the two units was comparable, and we'd recommend either forpurchase.andM;The CHPS/400 places a distant third, but at least it's still in the race.andO;Editing features in SmartScan are extremely limited, and gray-scale scanquality is poor in comparison with LightningScan and ScanMan.andP;  But the unitis good enough for &quot;position art,&quot; at least; we were able to get consistentlyusable images from it.andP;  With the purchase of an additional interface, thisscanner can be used in mixed PC and Mac environments with either computer.andO;And this is the lowest-priced unit.andP;  We look forward to further improvementsto the SmartScan software.andM;The Marstek scanners never made it out of the starting gate; we can'trecommend any of them in their current incarnations.andP;  In addition to the bugsalready mentioned, we suffered numerous crashes and scan distortions.andM;Mary Jane Westland is a graphic artist, trainer and writer in Southborough,Mass.andM;Thunderware's LightningScan 400 tied for first in the hand-held scanner racewith its external SCSI termination, Join command, capability to convert graydithers to 37 levels of true gray and edit in 256 levels of gray, redesignedscan head with rear wheels, and SnapGuide aid to straight scanning.andM;Logitech's ScanMan Model 32 was LightningScan's equal, with the capability toscan and edit 32 true-gray levels; a redesigned scan head with rear wheelsfor straighter scanning; scan direction and transparent/opaque selectionfeatures; and extensive options for saving, printing and copying.andP;  Both thetop contenders had excellent scan quality.andM;The Complete P.C.'s The Complete Half-Page Scanner/400 can be driven by bothMacs and IBM PCs and compatibles with the addition of an interface kit andwas the least expensive of the scanners reviewed.andP;  However, it had internalSCSI termination, unclear scan-head markings, rudimentary editing tools andonly one SCSI port.andM;Marstek's three models, the 105, 128 and 800, all use the same ScanLinksoftware ported from the PC version.andP;  ScanLink proved extremely unreliableand produced unacceptable results.andP;  The 128 scans up to 5 inches wide,compared with 4 inches for all the other models tested, but the extra widthmakes it hard to hold.andP;  The Mars 800 has scan resolutions up to 800 dpi, butsuffers from the same software problems as the other Mars units.andP;  Evenexcellent image-editing software (Digital Darkroom from Silicon Beach isincluded) cannot redeem these products.andM;Logitech Inc.andM;ScanMan Model 32: $499andM;6505 Kaiser Drive, Fremont, Calif.andP;
