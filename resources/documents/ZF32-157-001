Van NameandM;and Bill CatchingsandM;With the withdrawal of 3Com Corp. from the PC LAN operating system business,two products now dominate the powerful and expensive end of the market fornetwork software: the latest versions of Novell Inc.'s NetWare 386 andMicrosoft Corp.'s LAN Manager.andM;PC Week Labs examined LAN Manager 2.0 and NetWare v3.11 to see which is thebetter choice for network buyers.andM;Not surprisingly, there was no clear winner.andP;  The product that's right for agiven organization will depend on that organization's individual price,performance and feature needs.andM;If price is paramount, LAN Manager is the right choice.andP;  Performance is atoss-up, with each better in some situations.andP;  NetWare, however, is moremature overall, and its many options give it a slight edge in total features.andM;Budget-conscious buyers will find LAN Manager's low entry price appealing: Afive-user version costs only $995.andP;  An unlimited-user license runs muchhigher, at $5,495, but that price is small compared with $12,495 for a250-user NetWare license.andM;Even NetWare v3.11's cheapest version, a 20-user package, is expensive, at$3,495.andP;  In addition, many of NetWare v3.11's most important new features,such as support for Macintoshes, come in separately priced options.andM;Performance is a different story entirely.andP;  PC Week Labs' tests showed thateach product can beat the other in certain situations.andM;In simple file-copying tests, LAN Manager won, with a 20 percent to 35percent edge over NetWare v3.11.andP;  In tests in which PC Week Labs varied thesize of data requests to simulate the data flow of such other applications asdatabase servers, the results were more mixed.andM;On a lightly loaded network with requests of 128 and 1,024 bytes, NetWare wasabout two-thirds faster than LAN Manager.andP;  The two were neck-and-neck in PCWeek Labs' eight-station test, which simulated a network of 64 to 160 users.andM;When PC Week Labs cranked the test up to 16 stations that simulated the loadof 128 to 320 users, however, NetWare emerged the winner.andP;  Its performancedegraded linearly, while LAN Manager's dropped precipitously.andM;LAN Manager did a better job on the one- and eight-station tests withrequests of 4,096 bytes, staying even with NetWare.andP;  Once again, however,with 16 stations, LAN Manager's performance dropped severely.andM;These tests suggest that for very large networks, NetWare v3.11 will be thebetter choice, while for small to medium networks, the right buy will dependheavily on the intended applications.andM;With performance fairly close for all but very large networks, other factorsare likely to weigh more heavily in purchasers' decisions.andP;  For manypotential buyers, one of the most important points will be NetWare'smaturity.andP;  Although version 2.0 of LAN Manager is much more solid thanearlier versions, it is still the less mature product.andM;LAN Manager's relative immaturity was apparent during PC Week Labs' tests.andO;While NetWare exhibited no problems whatsoever, LAN Manager had many smallbut annoying difficulties.andP;  Notable problems included an XCOPY-related bug,inadequate documentation on using Novell Inc./Anthem Electronics Inc.andP;  NE3200adapters in the server, problems handling large loads while running with twoprocessors in the server, and the need for buyers to obtain a new driver fromMicrosoft to let Novell/Anthem NE2000 adapters work in 486-based clients.andM;Microsoft provided fixes for all but the multiprocessor problem, but buyersshould still allow some time for shaking out potential difficulties.andM;These problems aside, LAN Manager competes well with NetWare v3.11 when itcomes to features.andP;  Both products have a wide array of impressivecapabilities.andM;One key concern of LAN administrators is the protection of their data.andP;  Bothproducts address this concern with features such as support foruninterruptible power supplies, disk mirroring, drive duplexing, andautomatic remapping or &quot;hot fixing&quot; of bad file sectors.andM;While NetWare has traditionally led in this area, LAN Manager has added somenew data-protection wrinkles of its own.andP;  A useful one is its ability toduplicate user-specified, critical files on multiple servers at predefinedintervals.andM;Both products also have good basic security systems.andP;  They can protect files,encrypt passwords, create groups for resource access and delegate some partsof LAN administration to different users.andM;Administrators with only one server will find the two products comparable.andO;LAN Manager has a slight edge in ease of use, because all of itsadministrative functions are available through one program, but NetWare'smanagement tools are also good.andM;When it comes to managing multiple servers, however, LAN Manager leads.andP;  Itlets administrators group multiple servers to form a &quot;domain.&quot; Administratorscan manage that domain much as if it were a single server.andP;  All the serversin a domain share user IDs, groups and resources.andM;NetWare's counterpart to LAN Manager's domain facility is the NetWare NameService, a fairly new $1,995 option.andP;  That option, however, is not ascomplete or well integrated into the overall product as LAN Manager's domainmechanisms.andM;Managing the server is only one job of network administrators.andP;  Another keytask is setting up client workstations, and here NetWare wins.andP;  All anadministrator has to do to give a client access to the network is copy a fewfiles onto the client's disk.andP;  LAN Manager, by contrast, has a lengthy,although attractive and not difficult, menu-driven client installationprocedure.andM;The two products have one key difference, and its importance is hard togauge.andP;  The OS/2 operating system underlying all LAN Manager servers runsapplications in a CPU ring less privileged than that of OS/2 itself, whileNetWare applications run in Ring 0 with NetWare.andM;This obscure-sounding technical difference has potentially majorconsequences.andP;  It is possible for one NetWare server program, or NetWareLoadable Module (NLM), to interfere with another by writing to a section ofRAM that the other is using; LAN Manager's design prevents this problem.andP;  Abadly behaved NLM therefore could conceivably crash the server.andM;Exactly how important this design difference is, however, depends a greatdeal on what the server will be doing.andP;  If it will be providing only basicfile and print services, then the difference is likely to be a moot point.andO;If it will be running other server-based software (OS/2 programs or NLMs),however, the difference might matter; for NetWare users, it will depend onhow well the NLMs were written.andM;Both vendors also cite potential differences between the two designs in theperformance of client/server applications.andP;  Not enough server applicationsare yet available for either platform, however, to make a clear call in thisarea.andM;Some of Novell's own NLMs make NetWare v3.11 the winner when it comes tolinking to the non-PC world.andP;  For example, a NetWare server can also serveMacintosh clients with NetWare for Macintosh v3.0, an NLM that costs between$895 and $1,995.andP;  The base NetWare v3.11 product also includes TCP/IPsupport, and buyers can purchase NetWare server support for Unix Network FileSystem (NFS) clients for $4,995.andM;NetWare v3.11 also comes with two other notable features: Novell's Btrievedata manager NLM and an E-mail Message Handling Service.andM;Both products have large and generally good documentation sets.andP;  The manymanuals for each product have hundreds of pages explaining everything frominstallation to maintenance to everyday use.andP;  The main area in which bothcompanies should improve their manuals is performance tuning.andM;Both vendors also offer extensive technical support, but at high prices.andO;Novell's plan is both less expensive and more flexible, however.andM;</TEXT></DOC>
