Three fluvial units within the sequencecan be delineated in the basin. Volcanic pebbles are abundant in themiddle fluvial unit, in a zone that forms a crude time line. A pronouncedthickening of sandstone in the Westwater Canyon Member north of Gallup,once believed to be the apex of a large alluvial fan, is now thoughtto merely reflect a greater accumulation of sediment in response to downwarpingof the basin in that area. Provenance studies suggest that highlandsthat contributed detritus to Westwater Canyon streams were located severalhundred kilometers to the west and southwest of the San Juan basin, andthus fan apices would also have been several hundred kilometers upstream.The fluvial units recognized in the basin may well be coalesced distalfan deposits, but are probably best interpreted as vertically stackedbraided steam sequences. Facies changes in fine-grained interbeds ofthe Westwater Canyon probably have greater significance in terms of localizingore than any special attribute of the fluvial sandstones themselves.Uranium ore generally occurs in sandstones that are interbedded withgreenish-gray lacustrine mudstones. Pore waters that were expelled fromthese mudstones are thought to have been the source of the pore-fillingorganic matter (humate) associated with primary uranium ore in nearbysandstones.</TEXT></DOC>
