Mr. Kinnear is also a top-notch negotiator, oilman and administrator. In his spare time, he goes hunting and raises orchids.    With the possible exception of gardening, Mr. Kinnear will need all those skills to bring the nation's third-largest oil company through the crisis caused by the dramatic 1986 drop in oil prices, tumbling earnings, layoffs -- and looming over all -- by the staggering $12 billion-plus damage judgment to Pennzoil Co.    Texaco's very existence is threatened by the judgment, awarded after Houston-based Pennzoil persuaded a Texas jury a little more than a year ago that New York-based Texaco improperly derailed Pennzoil's attempt to acquire Getty Oil Co. If current appeals in Texas courts and the U.S. Supreme Court fail, Texaco could likely be forced into bankruptcy court, or faced with paying whatever out-of-court settlement Pennzoil demands.    And even after the Pennzoil matter is disposed of, Texaco may become a takeover target if its depressed stock price doesn't recover quickly. &quot;Texaco is trading at only 56% of its appraised net worth, whereas the average major oil company is trading at 83%,&quot; says Arthur Smith, president of John S. Herold Inc., a Greenwich, Conn., petroleum research firm.    Mr. Kinnear concedes that Texaco is being battered by its Pennzoil difficulties. Legal expenses are monstrous. Financial flexibility is reduced to the point where Texaco can't fix a major weakness -- dwindling oil reserves. The company &quot;hasn't been able to get its commercial-paper market going&quot; and endures &quot;increased borrowing costs,&quot; Mr. Kinnear says. Major banks that once were eager to do business now aren't. To raise $500 million to $600 million, for instance, the stock of some subsidiaries has been pledged to banks. But if Texaco spends that money, bank liens automatically will be placed on some Texaco assets, says Richard Brinkman, chief financial officer.    &quot;We have to put the Pennzoil matter behind us,&quot; says Mr. Kinnear. &quot;I'd like to settle it. I continue to think it's possible, but it just hasn't happened yet.&quot;    Top Texaco executives hope that Mr. Kinnear, a strong proponent of settling expensive litigation out of court, will smooth the way. Several years ago, Mr. Kinnear resolved a complicated $200 million lawsuit with Borden Corp. through out-of-court arbitration in which lawyers for both sides argued the case before Mr. Kinnear and a top Borden officer, who then negotiated an exchange of contractual services that favored both parties. &quot;He's a very aggressive but reasonable negotiator . . . but I loved working with him,&quot; says Robert Gutheil, a former Borden executive who sat across the table from Mr. Kinnear in the negotiations.    Karen Berndt, a senior Texaco attorney, explains a favorite Kinnear negotiating gambit: &quot;He'll let the lawyer be the bad guy and nix a proposal. He'll play the good guy.&quot; Adds Mr. Gutheil: &quot;You make a proposal, and he'll sit there for 10 minutes in silence&quot; to see if he can shake his opponent into countering his own offer.    &quot;I never had a disagreement with him that couldn't be worked out,&quot; says Oscar Wyatt, who as chairman of Coastal Corp. has bargained hard and often with Mr. Kinnear. &quot;We always walked away friends.&quot;    But a Borden-style arbitration or any other resolution isn't imminent. And Mr. Kinnear has refrained from exploiting a personal connection in the dispute: He has hunted bird and deer with Pogo Producing Co.'s chairman, William Liedtke Jr., brother of Pennzoil's chairman, J. Hugh Liedtke. But &quot;he's got his own company to run (Pogo Producing), and this is a matter between Texaco and Pennzoil,&quot; he says.    Settlement talks are at a stalemate. &quot;There has to be a mutual willingness to settle,&quot; Mr. Kinnear says. &quot;Since December 1985, Texaco has made Pennzoil four offers. After making a number of offers, there's no point in continuing to make offers.&quot;    In his zeal, Mr. Kinnear often becomes exasperated. &quot;He's impatient for results,&quot; says Richard Dickinson, senior vice president of manufacturing and marketing for Texaco U.S.A. &quot;If there's a problem, he bird-dogs you, asking you what you're doing every time he sees you. And you can't duck him. He'll track you down.&quot;    Initially, there was speculation that neither Mr. Kinnear nor Alfred DeCrane, the other leading contender for the top job, would succeed John K. McKinley, that the board might reach outside for a new leader. But at Mr. McKinley's behest, the board chose a successor from inside. When top executives at Texaco were summoned to the boardroom late one Friday in October and told that Mr. DeCrane was chairman and Mr. Kinnear president and chief executive, some were baffled. Had the race for Mr. McKinley's corner office ended in a tie? &quot;We just congratulated both of them,&quot; says one.    &quot;The company was pushing the perception that the two were a team,&quot; says Mark Gilman, analyst for E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. But it soon became clear who was boss.    Mr. Kinnear quickly told colleagues: &quot;I'm going to be running the show.&quot; When Mr. DeCrane came by to offer congratulations, &quot;I'm sure Al was disappointed, but he didn't express it to me,&quot; Mr. Kinnear recalls.    Although Mr. Kinnear says he intends no radical changes at Texaco, he had picked a team of aggressive young executives and designated the company's first chief financial officer even before he took over Jan. 1. He intends soon to visit and review every Texaco operation with an eye toward cutting costs.    He also plans &quot;a sharper focus&quot; on marketing, accelerating the installation of &quot;System 2000&quot; gasoline stations that emphasize increased gasoline sales rather than services. &quot;Marketing has already become a battleground among major oil companies,&quot; says E.F. Hutton's Mr. Gilman. &quot;It's one of the few areas for an oil company that has growth potential.&quot;    On experience alone, Mr. Kinnear is well-suited to lead the charge in marketing. His first big career break at Texaco came in 1959 when he was chosen to carry the Texaco name to Hawaii. There, local businessmen -- except for one Coca-Cola salesman -- didn't take the pleasant, young, crew-cutted Texaco man seriously at first. &quot;I'd call the phone answering service just to have someone to talk to,&quot; he recalls. But within three years, the Hawaiian Islands were dotted with 33 Texaco stations -- and each of them was equipped with a Coke machine. </TEXT></DOC>
