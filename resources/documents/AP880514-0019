KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Senate leaders appear satisfied enough withverification measures worked out in Geneva to open debate next weekon the U.S.-Soviet medium-range missile treaty.   But Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said he will notformally schedule that debate until three Senate committees holdhearings and approve the agreement.   ``I want to hear what the chairmen and ranking Republicanmembers of these committees have to say following these hearings,''Byrd said. ``They are the experts in this field.''   Some senators said there is now at least a chance the Senatewill consent to the ratification of the treaty by the timePresident Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev convenetheir Moscow summit on May 29.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is set to testify before theForeign Relations Committee on Monday afternoon on the agreement hereached this week in Geneva with Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze. The Armed Services and Intelligence committeesannounced they will hold a joint private meeting late Mondayafternoon.   Following a 90-minute luncheon briefing Friday by White Housenational security adviser Colin Powell, Byrd said he and otherSenate leaders were told the agreement removes a roadblock and is aforward step.   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas quoted Powell assaying Byrd's decision last week to postpone Senate action on thetreaty ``did make a difference'' in Geneva.   Negotiators addressed concerns in the Senate that the Sovietswere backing away from effective implementation of the on-siteinspection provisions of the treaty.   Other senators who attended the briefing also said the resultsof the Geneva talks seem constructive.   ``I'm optimistic we can move ahead,'' said Sen. Claiborne Pell,D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.   ``I think at this moment there is more optimism for the passageof this treaty than at at any other time during this longprocess,'' said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the ranking GOP member ofthe Armed Services Committee.   Warner said the Soviets changed their position to meet U.S.objections on every issue that was raised.   Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-range NuclearForces treaty, providing for the total elimination of U.S. andSoviet mid-range missiles, at their Washington summit last December.   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the Armed Services chairman, said he nowhopes that the treaty can be ratified in the 15 days that remainbefore the summit.   Opponents of the treaty were not satisfied, and Sen. JesseHelms, R-N.C., said he would offer ``something like a dozen''amendments to the pact.</TEXT></DOC>
