RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The very authority by which independentcounsel Lawrence E. Walsh brought indictments Wednesday againstfour major participants in the Iran-Contra affair is beingchallenged in a constitutional battle before the Supreme Court.   But a Supreme Court decision striking down the so-called specialprosecutor law would not necessarily invalidate the indictmentsreturned against former national security adviser John M.Poindexter, fired White House aide Lt. Col. Oliver L. North,retired Air Force Maj. Richard V. Secord and his business partner,Albert Hakim.   Attorney General Edwin Meese III had given Walsh a back-upappointment in the Justice Department in an attempt to shield theIran-Contra inquiry from legal attacks that the special prosecutorlaw improperly takes power from the president and confers it uponthe federal judges.   However, the status of Walsh's investigation is further blurredbecause he began his work before the back-up authority wasconferred. The targets of the investigation are expected to arguethat the initial absence of the supporting authorization taints theentire inquiry.   The Supreme Court will hear arguments April 26 in theconstitutional challenge to the special prosecutor law. Eightjustices will decide the outcome. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy hasremoved himself from consideration of the case without explanation.A decision is expected by July.   A panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washingtonruled, 2-1, in January that the independent counsel provision ofthe Ethics in Government Act of 1978 is unconstitutional.   The law authorizes a federal court to appoint a specialprosecutor when the attorney general recommends an independentinvestigation of a high-ranking administration official accused ofa crime.   The appeals court ruling came in the investigation of formerJustice Department official Theodore B. Olson on charges he lied toCongress.   Alexia Morrison, the independent counsel investigating the Olsoncase, appealed to the Supreme Court. Ms. Morrison did not receiveback-up authority from Meese and her investigation would be endedif the high court declares the special prosecutor lawunconstitutional.   Two other inquiries by independent counsels also could beaffected by the court's ruling.   The perjury conviction of former White House aide Michael K.Deaver could stand or fall on the outcome. The investigation thatled to the illegal lobbying conviction of former White House aideLyn Nofziger had back-up authority similar to that conferred in theIran-Contra case.</TEXT></DOC>
