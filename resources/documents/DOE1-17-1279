<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-17-1279 </DOCNO><TEXT>We introduce a dual-fiber-bundle description of the gauge theory of electromagnetism.Using this, and requiring particles to obey the wave equation in thefive-dimensional fiber bundle, we show that the existence of a givenunique radius for the compact fifth dimension breaks the duality transformationinvariance of the theory. One of the reasons for the possible existenceof magnetic monopoles is the very pretty duality invariance of Maxwell'sequations achieved if magnetic currents are present. Since we show thatthis duality transformation invariance is broken if we try to extendit to the fiber bundle formulation, the existence of Dirac magnetic monopolesbecomes somewhat less compelling theoretically.</TEXT></DOC>
