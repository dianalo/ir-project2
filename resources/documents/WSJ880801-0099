Zooming past these buildings, giant Mercedeses overtake giant BMWs on speed-limitless autobahns. They ferry executives to spacious suburban homes or to spas for their six-week annual vacations.    But in tandem with prosperity has come a national epidemic of inertia. Dynamism has given way to complacency, rebuilding has been replaced by conserving, adapting is being shunned in favor of comfort, risktaking now abhorred in search of safety.    West Germany is stuck.    When begged by other industrialized nations to grow faster to help bolster the world economy, Germany says it can't. When asked by its Common Market partners to help cut farm subsidies, Germany says it won't. When most of its trading partners cut income taxes, Germany says it will trim them in 1990, and meanwhile it sharply raises taxes on gasoline and tobacco. When French or British or Italian companies form alliances to get ready for the borderless Europe of 1992, German companies say they are strong enough to stand alone.    This is particularly bad right now for the rest of the world. The U.S. is pushing Germany to harness its huge trade surpluses, contribute more in some way to European defense, and to give more aid to the Third World. Germany's trading partners want more access to closed parts of its economy, such as the multibillion-dollar market to supply the government with telephone equipment. Mostly, the Germans say no.    But being stuck is also bad for Germany, the third-biggest capitalist economy. The U.S., despite its huge trade and budget deficits, continues to create jobs. German unemployment has been stuck at over 8%, or more than two million people, since 1983. After encouraging consumer spending, Japan is booming at an incredible 11% growth rate for the first quarter. German growth has been stuck at around 2% since 1980. Most of the industrialized world has stepped up population growth a little in recent years. Germany's population has been dropping.    Companies in Great Britain, France, Italy and Spain are all building momentum to get ready for 1992, when trade barriers in Europe are to be dismantled. German companies are sticking with what they have. Domestic investment has dropped from 9% of output in the mid-1970s to 5 1/2% in 1985.    Can even a successful economy tread water? &quot;Certainly not,&quot; says Thomas J. Kuhnke, senior vice president for J. P. Morgan G.m.b.H. in Frankfurt. &quot;But there is a lack of awareness here that relatively speaking we're being left behind, that others are overtaking us.&quot;    Some are becoming aware. Chancellor Helmut Kohl recently warned of eventual cutbacks in the welfare state and possible social unrest unless the nation's shrinking pool of workers agrees to put in longer hours in the 1990s. A handful of top businessmen warns that 1992 poses a challenge too real to ignore and an opportunity too good to miss. In perhaps the one clear sign of movement, a few German companies are beginning to buy foreign companies or to forge inter-European alliances.    Will this be enough? Many Germans, who love to worry, are worried. The approach to problems here is &quot;a strange mixture of confidence and fear,&quot; says Goetz Hoffmann von Waldau, a Frankfurt executive recruiter. 'The whole thing is to be safe. We did so much rebuilding after the war that we now want to keep it all.&quot;    Adds Albrecht Matuschka, a management consultant in Munich: &quot;We have it too good. We can still do it, instead of just patting our fat bellies. But right now the German economy, judged against its potential, is doing a lousy job.&quot;    Some fear that continuing to operate below potential could lead to major problems. &quot;Germans are very, very slow to react to change,&quot; says Henri Deegenaar, chairman of Defi, a French investment company. &quot;They will have a tremendous demographic problem in 25 years: How can your economy grow when you have no people? In the very long term it makes more sense for a company -- German or British or American or French -- to go where the people are, like Spain or Italy.&quot;    Social stagnation is also causing problems. German companies pay the highest wages in Europe for the shortest workweek. They suffer almost no strikes. But labor costs are getting out of hand.    The government is trying to maintain the scope of its generous health benefits while squeezing costs. One proposed law would cut the prices pharmaceutical companies would get for their drugs by more than 30%, slashing their profits. (Drug prices are regulated here.) The government also may permit foreign drug concerns to enter the market.    Drug companies are fighting the proposal. &quot;With lower prices we won't be able to maintain research and development spending, and we're not going to find as many new drugs,&quot; complains Otto May, director of health politics for Boehringer Ingelheim G.m.b.H., a big pharmaceuticals maker. &quot;I asked the health minister if it was true that he had 25 letters of thanks on his desk from U.S. drug companies,&quot; Dr. May says. &quot;He said it wasn't true. I said 'Maybe it's 27 letters?'&quot;    The lack of dynamism has already meant lost business. Take financial services. A few years ago, German authorities allowed trading in new financial instruments and deregulated the capital markets. &quot;It was a great moment,&quot; Mr. Kuhnke of Morgan recalls. &quot;Everybody felt Frankfurt would establish itself as the No. 2 center in Europe after London.&quot;    Removal of a stock-transaction tax would have kept Frankfurt competitive with less-regulated London. But authorities wouldn't remove it. Now, the budget-conscious government wants to impose a 10% withholding tax on interest on savings accounts and bonds.    &quot;The mood is now entirely changed,&quot; Mr. Kuhnke laments. &quot;It's no longer a question of Frankfurt's being No. 2. The question is: Will we be No. 4 or No. 5 or No. 6?&quot;    Changes are being forced on Germany, though. The European Community's plan to break down internal trade barriers by the end of 1992 means that Germany no longer will be able to bar British beer or French sausages because they don't conform to its protectionist purity laws. Even the notoriously chauvinistic Bundespost, the state postal and telecommunications monopoly, may eventually have to buy some digital switches from U.S. suppliers.    Many U.S. multinationals have long operated in Germany through subsidiaries that follow local rules and customs. International Business Machines Corp.'s IBM Deutschland employs 30,000 Germans, although it had to go to court to get approval for them to work on Sunday. But soon, under the umbrella of the 1992 reforms, smaller U.S. companies may be able to operate more freely here, to buy German companies without interference, or to set up joint ventures on more favorable terms.    But critics contend that while the threat of 1992 could help knock some German companies off dead center, it won't by itself solve deep-seated political and economic problems. The U.S., Japan and other European countries have been sweeping away regulations and outdated work restrictions. German economic success has helped add them.    German workers now enjoy 30 workdays a year of paid vacation. Unions are fighting for a 35-hour week at 40-hour pay. Mr. Matuschka, the consultant, is a polio victim. He says laws designed to protect the handicapped (they can't be fired) actually prevent even naturally sympathetic employers like himself from hiring them.    Years ago, the retail clerks' union successfully pushed for laws that force all shops to close at 6:30 p.m. and bar them from opening on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. A reform that recently passed after three years of debate will let stores stay open until 9 p.m. on Thursday nights beginning next year. But the stores have to cut 2 1/2 hours from another day of the week.    Regardless of how late the stores stay open, it's hard to see what Germans have left to buy. While Japan needs more bridges and houses, Germany's road, rail and air transport systems are less than 40 years old. Its office buildings and dwellings are also largely postwar. While Americans put up with planned obsolescence, Germans enjoy sturdily built washing machines and cars that don't need to be replaced every two years.    &quot;My family has four cars,&quot; says FranzJosef Trouvain, chief economist for Deutsche Bank. &quot;Am I supposed to buy a fifth car?&quot;    Because of such saturation, German officials argue, cutting already low interest rates or pumping up a budget deficit that is already a higher percentage of their economy than the U.S. deficit, would lead to rampant inflation. Germans dread that more than anything.    Once such factors are understood, many here say, much of what happens makes more sense. German caution shouldn't be taken for inaction. Most companies have had units for years in other European countries. More than 50% of German exports go to the European Community.    Some companies are acting. Volkswagen AG two years ago bought Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles, or SEAT, a Spanish auto maker, as one move toward a pan-European auto company. Deutsche Bank, once the embodiment of caution, bought Bank of America's Italian unit and part of a Spanish bank, and says it wants to be the first truly pan-European bank.    As their contribution to national caution, German companies tend to accumulate cash. Siemens AG, the electronics giant, has $13 billion in cash on its books. The companies all say they will invest when conditions are right. &quot;For most German companies 1992 is already here,&quot; says Reinhard Fischer, an analyst for Banque Paribas Capital Markets in London. &quot;The others are doing a lot of strategic planning and less talking than their French and Italian counterparts. They will wait and wait and wait and when they come they will come massively.&quot;    Some see the threat of easier access to the German market from outside as a powerful motivator. &quot;What's starting to get people off their comfortable behinds is that they see others getting ready to move in,&quot; says Achim Stoehr, a director of the consulting firm Arthur D. Little International Inc. in Wiesbaden.    The French are targeting certain industries such as publishing and telecommunications, and building up German-sized companies, in a bid to dominate the European market for those products. The Italians are seeking alliances and joint ventures. And though hostile takeovers remain virtually unheard of here, Mr. Stoehr says he is currently doing studies of German acquisitions for two big British companies.    Some here are confident that German companies not only will hold their own at home, they will be able to further exploit more-dynamic markets abroad. &quot;The really common Common Market will give cash-rich German companies something to buy, more places to expand outside of Germany,&quot; says Mr. Trouvain of Deutsche Bank. &quot;They have the weapons and the ammunition and they will use them.&quot;    ---            West Germany: A Statistical Portrait                      Birthrates    (Live births per 1,000 population, 1986)                 United States     15.5                 France            14.1                 United Kingdom    13.3                 Japan             11.5                 Germany           10.2                    Savings Deposits    (Per capita, in 1986 U.S. dollars)                 Japan             $27,303                 Germany           $12,288                 United States      $9,733                 France             $6,207                 United Kingdom     $5,818                       Hours Worked    (In manufacturing industry, per employed person per year)                         1986    1985    1980    1970       Japan             2,133   2,148   2,140   2,252       United States     1,966   1,959   1,918   1,930       United Kingdom    1,901   1,905   1,897   2,101       France            1,662   1,663   1,768   1,930       Germany           1,633   1,646   1,706   1,885                       Labor Disputes    Working days lost per year per 1,000 employees                         1986    1985    1980    1970       United States      121     82      230     941       United Kingdom      89    301      531     489       France              32     41       96     110       Japan                6      6       25     118       Germany              1    1.6        6       4   Source: Institute of the German Economy.</TEXT></DOC>
