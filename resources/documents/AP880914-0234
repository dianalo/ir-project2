Perelman has sold his 15 percent stakein TW Services Inc. for about $137 million, the latest in a stringof asset sales by the billionaire takeover strategist.   Perelman, who is chairman of Revlon Inc., sold 7.23 millionshares of TW Services, a major food services company, for $19apiece on Tuesday, according to Revlon vice chairman Donald Drapkin.   Last Friday, Perelman's MacAndrews andamp; Forbes Group Inc. agreed tosell its Technicolor Holdings Inc. film processing business toBritain's Carlton Communications PLC for $780 million.   In addition, Perelman reportedly has agreed to sell hisConsolidated Cigar Corp. to a leveraged buyout group for $125million.   The moves, which reportedly have raised Perelman's takeoverwarchest to about $2 billion, have fueled speculation that theaccomplished takeover strategist was looking for major targets.   Perelman, who acquired Technicolor in 1982, won a bittertakeover fight for Revlon in 1985 and has made several,unsuccessful overtures to Gillette Co. since late 1986.   He has developed a reputation as a builder rather than aspeculative corporate raider, boosting profits at Revlon andTechnicolor during his stewardship of those companies.   The sale of a 15 percent chunk of TW Services also has raisedspeculation that the food services company might be a takeovertarget. Stock in TW, which operates the Denny's and Hardee's fastfood chains among others, rose $1.62{ to $20.62{ a share in heavyNew York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday.   Drapkin said Perelman was supportive of TW management, and hadnot sold his TW shares to the company.</TEXT></DOC>
