This paper describes theimplementation of an effective audit program at Pacific Northwest Laboratoryfor their licensing-related Randamp;D work. The performance of an audit isdestined for mediocrity and perhaps failure (from the auditee's viewpoint)if the audit team is comprised solely from the ``Audit Group.'' Employeesview personnel from the ``Audit Group'' with distant suspicion becausethe Audit group is not involved in the day-to-day technical work, theAudit Group is not subject to the cost and schedule pressures of thetechnical work, and often the auditors are not strong technically inthe area being audited. Many of the employees in an Randamp;D organizationhold advanced degrees have become nationally and internationally knownand respected for their work. For these and other reasons the employeessometimes do not hold the Auditors' opinions in the same high regardas they hold the opinions of peers in their profession. Adding a personwho is technically competent in the area being audited and who is respected(both for technical and managerial competence) by the group being auditedadds validity to the audit, the audit team, and the audit report. Employeessee the technical person as sympathetic to their pressures and understandingof the problems of doing Randamp;D work. Responses to the audit report aretimely and more complete when the problem is identified by or supportedby a peer.</TEXT></DOC>
