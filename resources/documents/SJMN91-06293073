If more rehearsal was obviously needed to achieve hisgoals on the program, and if he was cautious to the verge of being tentative,there was still no quibbling with Balter's rise in the East Coast concertworld of late.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HIGH-POWERED CELLIST GIVES DRIVE TO A MODESTVEHICLE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Classical Music Review  </MEMO><TEXT>     The biggest excitement of the moment focused on the major Europeanprize-winner Gustav Rivinius as soloist. Having Rivinius play the low-keyHaydn Cello Concerto in C major is something like hiring a four-engine jet toget to Milpitas. Clearly Rivinius has immense control and technical gifts, andhis 1712 Grancino cello has the power to project through the entire Center forthe Performing Arts. You wished desperately for him to sub one of the grandconcertos that would be a proper challenge.;   The new young artist was amarvelous breath of fresh air on stage, especially given the overdose ofrepeat soloists of recent years.;   You could wish for more, yes: someornaments added to the skeletal slow movement, for instance; or perhaps a moredemanding cadenza (solo display section) than the one taken from an anonymous18th-century source. But Rivinius brought things off with a fine flourish inthe brilliant, virtuosic rapidity of the finale.;   The Haydn cello concertois a late discovery, first identified as echt-Haydn by musicologist OldrichPuckert in the Czech National Library 30 years ago. The concerto turned out tobe one of Haydn's more arresting early works, full of wit and brio.;   Theconcert ended with Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5 (1937), created duringan ugly period of artistic repression in the USSR. It was one of the mostastute -- and most moving -- of modern symphonies, seemingly toeing thecensors' line, yet actually doing quite the opposite. After his censure andperiod of silence, Shostakovich wrote the piece and was reported to havesubtitled it, &quot;A Soviet Artist's Reply to Just Criticism&quot;; Joseph Stalin'scommunists swallowed the bait.;   The symphony is a tragic work by anymeasure, running against Soviet dictates of optimism, folk music, andavoidance of formal structures. Fortunately, the audience at the premiere wasdeeply moved, even to tears, and the work was viewed as unmistakably Russian.;  Balter and the orchestra surely need more time to get reacquainted and togel as a team. They showed the potential at last in the two closing movementsof the Shostakovich. After taking very slow tempos throughout the symphony,Balter boldly injected a highly passionate, emotionally charged texture,bringing out all the pathos and irony of Shostakovich's best-known symphony.It was grandly riveting.;   The orchestra reciprocated, and there were keensolos by the unflappable Concertmaster Byung-Woo Kim and by the compellingflutist Maria Tamburrino Cleve -- enough to make one forget lack of polishelsewhere in the ensemble.; SAN JOSE SYMPHONY, Alan Balter guest conductor,Gustav Rivinius soloist.
