In addition,the staff has developed some potential project alternatives, and requestscomments from the public on these alternatives. Public meetings will be held on August 18, 1988, as described in the notice.Interested agencies, officials, and members of the public are invited toreview and comment on the new information and proposals that have beendeveloped since the DEIS was issued. The public meetings are to be heldat the Holiday Inn Convention Center, 1350 Blue Lakes Boulevard North,Twin Falls, Idaho 83301. The first meeting will be held from 1:00 p.m.to 4:00 p.m.; the second meeting will be held from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.For further information, contact Kathleen Sherman at (202) 376-9527. <ITAG tagnum="84">New Circumstances </ITAG>Implementation of Comprehensive Planning <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission: Electric Consumers ProtectionAct of 1986 (Amended the Federal Power Act) </ITAG>(a) Amended section 10(a)(A) of the Federal Power Act requires the Commission,in its hydropower licensing decisions, to consider, among other things,the extent to which the proposed project is consistent with a comprehensiveplan (where one exists) for improving, developing, or conserving a waterwayor waterways affected by the project that is prepared by: (i) An agency established pursuant to Federal law that has the authorityto prepare such a plan; or (ii) The State in which the facility is or will be located. (b) In Order No. 481-A, Order on Rehearing, issued April 27, 1988, theCommission found that the Northwest Power Planning Council's Columbia RiverBasin Fish and Wildlife Program and the Northwest Conservation and ElectricPower Plan are comprehensive plans. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Northwest Power Planning Council (NWPPC): Protected Areas </ITAG>(a) The NWPPC is proposing to amend the Columbia River Basin Fish and WildlifeProgram and Northwest Conservation and Electric Power Plan to incorporate``protected area'' designation to protect critical fish and wildlife habitatfrom new hydroelectric development; the final rule is expected to be implementedin August, 1988. (b) A proposed protected area within the reach of the Snake River includedin the DEIS, begins at Vinyard Creek located at the headquarters of TwinFalls reservoir, and extends to the mouth of the Snake River; proposeddesignated protection is for wild resident fish habitat, wintering waterfowl,and bald eagles. (c) The proposed Milner and Star Falls projects are upstream of VinyardCreek, so they would not be affected by the proposed rulemaking, however,the proposed Auger Falls project is within the designated reach. (d) The Twin Falls project would not be affected by the proposed protectedareas designation, according to the NWPPC's draft rule dated May 2, 1988,which states that the proposed amendments would apply only to new hydropowerprojects, not to existing dams. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. State of Idaho: Comprehensive State Water Plan/Interim ProtectedRivers (effective July 1, 1988) </ITAG>(a) Designates a portion of the Snake River within the study area as aninterim protected river, pursuant to section 42-1734H of the Idaho Code,which includes the Star Falls and Auger Falls project sites. (b) The proposed Milner project is upstream of the designated reach. (c) The existing Twin Falls project is not affected because any designationof waterways as interim protected rivers or protected rivers does not affectthe operation or relicensing of hydropower projects, including but notlimited to the expansion of capacity which does not enlarge existing boundariesor project impoundments. Proposed Amended Star Falls Application <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Proposed Schedule for Filing </ITAG>(a) The amended application is scheduled to be filed on November 17, 1988,as stated by letter from the applicant to the Commission dated June 30,1988, which proposes Alternative 1 as described in their filing of April1, 1988, and described below.(b) The proposed schedule includes appropriate agency consultation underandSection; 4.38 of the Commission's regulations.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Proposed Changes in Project Configuration and Operation</ITAG>(a) Project features would be moved away from Star Falls by moving thedam upstream, and by using a buried penstock instead of an open canal,to reduce impacts to visual quality and cultural resources.(b) The dam, would be higher than originally proposed, and the reservoirwould be capable of storing and releasing water to enhance conditions forwhitewater boating downstream of the project, including the 14-mile-longMurtuagh reach which ends at the Twin Falls reservoir.(c) The buried penstock would be on the north side of the river, so wetlandson the south side of the river that would have been crossed by the opencanal which was originally proposed, would not be disturbed by projectconstruction.(d) The powerhouse would be located on the north side of the river, andwould be placed in an excavation about 20 feet below the surrounding terrain.(e) No excavation in the river channel would be made for the tailrace,so rapids below Star Falls used by whitewater boaters which would havebeen excavated for the tailrace at the original powerhouse location, wouldnot be affected.(f) The bypassed reach between the dam and the powerhouse would be shorterwith the new proposed configuration, so the length of river, and relatedaquatic resources, that would be affected by reduced flows from projectoperation would be less when compared to the original project configuration.<ITAG tagnum="84">New Information Since the Deis was Issued</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Filing by the applicant for the Milner Project (March 31, 1988)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. New Proposals </ITAG>(a) Minimum flow for fisheries are proposed to be 58 cfs leakage from thedam during the irrigation season, and an additional 92 cfs during the non-irrigationfor a total of 150 cfs.(b) Upland habitat would be developed and donated to Idaho Department ofFish and Game.(c) New proposals for recreation include: Building an interpretive centerwith picnic facilities; building additional water ski dock(s) on Milnerreservoir; further development of public facilities at a Bureau of LandManagement Wildlife Habitat Management Area; building a kayak launch; anddeveloping a communication network to quickly inform kayakers of flow conditionsbelow Milner dam.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Information Previously Unavailable to the Staff</ITAG>(a) Operations and physical constraints of Milner reservoir with respectto releasing flows for whitewater boating were described; releasing theflows over the dam at levels recommended in the DEIS is not possible underpresent spillway gating conditions, and if providing flows for whitewaterrecreation required the dewatering of irrigation diversions on weekends,as much as 5 days thereafter would be required to re-regulate irrigationdeliveries to 450,000 acres.(b) Information on project economics was provided, including the cost ofbuilding a new dam without the project, and an economic analysis of lostirrigation water to provide staff-recommended flows for fisheries and whitewaterrecreation.(c) Information was provided concerning water rights and the implementationof state water law with respect to flows which may be diverted from theSnake River if the proposed Milner Project is not built.Filing by the Applicant for the Twin Falls Project (March 31, 1988)<ITAG tagnum="81">1. New Proposals</ITAG>(a) The applicant proposes two alternative plans for flows to be releasedover Twin Falls; Plan A would provide 140 cfs during daylight hours onweekends and holidays all year, and Plan B would provide 140 cfs duringdaylight hours on weekends and holidays from September to March and provide140 cfs during daylight hours daily from April to August.(b) A small weir would be constructed at the top of the falls to directthe water over both sides of the falls, to create a similar visual impressionfrom a flow of 140 cfs, as is seen with flows of 300 and 500 cfs.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Information Previously Unavailable to the Staff</ITAG>(a) A series of photographs were presented which show Twin Falls at 80cfs, 140 cfs, 300 cfs, and 500 cfs, and a graph showing the number of viewersseeing flows of 140 cfs or more under existing conditions, the projectas originally proposed, and with Plans A and B described above.(b) Graphs showing average monthly and average daily visitor use at theproject were presented.(c) Results of a cooperative study with the Bureau of Land Management wereprovided, which concerned the effects of construction activities on nestingraptors, conducted on the Snake River Birds of Prey Natural Area in associationwith the reconstruction of the Swan Falls dam spillway.(d) Results of electrofishing efforts at Shoshone Falls, located downstreamof Twin Falls, were presented to further characterize the fish speciespresent in the study reach.(e) Actual operations and maintenance costs, insurance costs, and tax estimatesbased on historical local costs and current federal tax statutes were providedto more precisely estimate project costs.Water Quality Data (To Be Analyzed in the Supplement to the DEIS)1. Water quality data filed jointly by all four applicants on September29, 1987, includes: Diel dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature data forthe Milner, Star Falls, and Twin Falls projects collected July 27-29, 1987,and August 24-26, 1987; DO and other water quality parameters for all fourprojects collected July 30, 1987, and August 26, 1987; and sediment analysesfor pesticides, heavy metals, and PCB's for samples collected above Milnerdam, above Star Falls, and above Twin Falls on August 26, 1987.2. Water quality data filed September 29, 1987, which was collected forthe Snake River as required by the NPDES discharge permit for the J.R.Simplot Company and Ore-Ida Foods, Inc.; this includes temperature andDO profiles for Milner reservoir on May 29, 1987, June 10, 1987, June 24,1987, July 28-29, 1987, August 10, 1987, August 24, 1987, September 7-8,1987, and September 21-22, 1987 (this information was filed by RalstonAssociates, a consultant which collected the data filed jointly by theapplicants).3. Water quality data filed March 31, 1988, by Idaho Power Company whichprovided a comparison of DO measurements in Milner reservoir and Twin Fallsreservoir collected in 1983; this filing also included a partial DO andtemperature profile for Twin Falls reservoir collected during June to September1983.<ITAG tagnum="84">New Staff Alternatives</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Milner Alternative</ITAG>(a) In order to provide power generation from project-specific mitigativeflow releases and increase the operating range of the project, a smallturbine would be installed at the dam in addition to the 44 MW turbineat the powerhouse location proposed by the applicant.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Auger Falls Alternative</ITAG>(a) In order to reduce impacts on visual quality and recreation, preventraptor collision with the transmission line, and minimize impacts on sturgeonhabitat in the pool below the powerhouse from blasting for the penstocktrenches and powerhouse, an underground powerhouse and transmission linewould be constructed, and tunnels would be used to convey water from thecanal to the powerhouse instead of surface penstocks.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Comprehensive Water Block (CWB)</ITAG>(a) Since the Snake River is a regulated system, an objective of the CWBis to ensure that water will be available to provide project-specific mitigativeflows to be set by license articles.(b) Another objective of the CWB is to maximize consistency with the StateWater Plan and minimize potential conflicts with existing water rights.(c) The licensees could potentially lease water for the CWB from the WaterSupply Bank, described in Policy 4B of the State Water Plan, which alsostates that use of the Water Supply Bank created by Idaho Code 42-1762shall be encouraged.(d) It is the staff's intent to recognize the physical limitations of thesystem so that flows for project-specific mitigation would be releasedso as to minimize interference with irrigation operations and also minimizethe potential for flooding of low-lying areas.(e) Flows to be released for project-specific flow requirements could beaccounted for when the water is released from American Falls reservior,and measured below Milner dam.(f) The CWB could be an accounting mechanism for the licensees, to equitablyshare the responsibility for providing mitigation flows, since water whichis released for American Falls reservoir would flow through all the proposedprojects.<ITAG tagnum="6">Lois D.
