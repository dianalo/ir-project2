JeffersonStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CSCCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   Computer Sciences Corp. said it formally protested a California Department of Health Services decision to award a $122 million contract to a competitor because of concerns about Computer Sciences' &quot;tenacity and perseverance&quot; and ability to perform.    Earlier this month, the department indicated that it would give the five-year contract for processing Medi-Cal claims to General Motors Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems Corp. unit, even though the EDS bid was $2 million higher than that of Computer Sciences. EDS also scored lower than Computer Sciences in a bidding evaluation by state evaluators, a department spokesman said.    Medi-Cal is California's version of the health services program for the poor known nationwide as Medicaid.    Acting as a lobbyist for EDS in the contract bidding was David Swoap, who served from 1983 to 1985 as secretary of the state's Health andamp; Welfare Agency, which oversees the Department of Health Services. Mr. Swoap said his San Francisco-based government relations firm represents EDS on a number of issues.    In Dallas, a spokesman for EDS declined to comment on Computer Sciences' action.    Stan Rosenstein, project manager for the state's Medi-Cal Procurement Project, said officials determined that Computer Sciences &quot;wasn't a responsible bidder,&quot; based on the price structure of its bid and &quot;performance problems we've had in the past with them.&quot;    The computer services concern, based in El Segundo, Calif., has processed MediCal insurance claims for the state since 1978 and remains under contract until next September. Mr. Rosenstein said the company's performance problems have included delays in processing claims and paying medical providers. Computer Sciences also has been &quot;consistently late&quot; in providing certain quality control products, he said, resulting in some incorrect payments to providers and incorrect reporting to the state. And the company has failed to set up sufficient toll-free telephone lines to handle inquiries from providers, he added.    A Computer Sciences executive, however, said the state hadn't previously complained about its performance and had encouraged the company to bid on the new contract.    Arthur B. Sims, a Computer Sciences vice president, said state officials &quot;made a mistake&quot; in passing over his company for the contract. &quot;They're attempting to justify it by using this nonperformance issue as a screen,&quot; he said.    Mr. Sims acknowleged that the company &quot;has made minor mistakes&quot; in its nine years of work for the state, but said Computer Sciences &quot;has consistently delivered a high level of service.&quot; Computer Sciences, with revenue of $1.03 billion in fiscal 1987 ended April 3, holds a large number of federal information technology services contracts and serves as fiscal intermediary for New York state's Medicaid program.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Computer Sciences shares fell 87.5 cents, to close at $54.25.    The final California contract won't be awarded until the state Department of General Services hears Computer Sciences' protest. That process could take as long as 60 days, the company said.    A GTE Corp. unit that also bid on the contract hasn't filed a protest with the Department of General Services, Mr. Rosenstein said. Spokesmen for GTE, a Stamford, Conn., telecommunications company, couldn't be reached for comment late yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
