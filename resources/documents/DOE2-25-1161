The hydraulicprops (M-87 um) were modernized by increasing the outside diameter ofthe cylinder from 194 mm to 203 mm and by applying thermal treatmentof the steel to strengthen the prop. An increase in nominal load bearingcapacity from 800 kN to 1300-1400 kN was achieved with a strength reserveof 1.86 relative to the admissible value.</TEXT></DOC>
