The legislation was offered by Senate Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell of Maine ``to express to the government of China theconcern which the American people feel about the continuingprosecution of Chinese students and workers who support thepro-democracy movement,'' Mitchell said.   It calls on Bush to make sure the leaders of China understand``that until they recognize the Chinese people's legitimate desirefor democracy, human rights and justice, that relations between ourtwo countries will remain strained.''   The sanctions amendment was attached to pending legislationauthorizing $4.66 billion for the State Department and alliedagencies during the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1.   Reacting to the Senate action, White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater told reporters in Paris, ``We feel that the United Stateshas imposed sanctions that are meaningful and that adequately conveyour sense of condemnation of the events that occurred in China. Wealso believe that we need to be mindful of long-term relationshipswith that country as we move forward.''   He said there is a ``fair degree of unanimity'' among the UnitedStates' summit partners on the issue.   He said the administration would consider the legislation ``butgenerally speaking, we think we have taken the right course, thatthat has been recognized by other nations of the world. We feel it'salso supported and recognized by the American public.''   Mitchell noted that while the amendment requires the president tosuspend certain trade programs, it also has a provision which``gives him the flexibility to cease any suspension or termination... if he finds it in the security interest of the United States todo so.''   The measure adopts several sanctions adopted earlier by the House.   These include six-month suspensions of trade insurance by theOverseas Private Investment Corp. and the use of U.S. funds tosupport trade with China.   Other sanctions include the suspension of export of satellitesintended to be launched by China and the suspension of nuclearcooperation until the president can certify China is not involved innuclear proliferation.   The Senate also adopted a series of non-binding suggestions inwhich they urged Bush to take stiffer steps. He should, the Senatesaid:   _Direct the Export-Import Bank to immediately postpone approvalof applications for financing American exports to China.   _Instruct U.S. representatives at international financialinstitutions to oppose all loans to China.   _Review the advisability of continuing to extend to Chinamost-favored-nation trade treatment.   _Review all trade agreements between the two countries.   _Review commercial agreements governing Chinese-Americancooperation on satellite launches.   _Review the Chinese-American agreement on the peaceful uses ofatomic energy.   _Consult with U.S. allies at the upcoming economic summit inParis on adopting a collective economic response to repression inChina.   _Review high technology exports to China.   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas endorsed theamendment, saying the Chinese government has ``shown no signs ofrelenting'' in its persecution of those who took part in or appearedto encourage the pro-democracy demonstrations.   ``They are still sliding down a very slippery and dangerousslope,'' Dole said.
