The study, in which 19 patients were treated at a Chinese cancer clinic, was too small to prove that the treatment is better than conventional bladder cancer therapies. But it significantly enhances the credibility of a new approach to fighting cancer, called photodynamic therapy, which is beginning to come of age as an anti-cancer weapon.    The study was conducted by U.S. researchers at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital, the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo, N.Y., and by Chinese researchers in a town about 550 miles west of Beijing in Henan province. A report on the work appears in this week's New England Journal of Medicine.    Photodynamic therapy involves the injection of a special &quot;photosensitizing&quot; drug that is preferentially absorbed by tumor cells. When exposed to bright, but nonburning, laser light of certain colors, the drug generates toxic chemicals that kill cancer cells.    In the study, researchers said the treatment eradicated tumors in nine of 19 patients; tumors were significantly reduced in nine of the remaining 10 patients. The therapy's main side effect was that patients were not able to stay in the sun for about a month after treatment because of the possibility of severe sunburns caused by lingering traces of the photosensitizing drug.    Chinese doctors are especially interested in photodynamic therapy because it is a &quot;one-shot therapy,&quot; said George R. Prout, a Massachusetts General Hospital urologist who helped conduct the study. The therapy requires a single-laser treatment about three days after patients are injected with the photosensitizing drug. In a country with few cancer centers and limited transportation, that is a big advantage over conventional anti-cancer therapies, which typically require months of periodic treatments, he said.    Photodynamic therapy using a drug called hematoporphyrin -- which has been approved for experimental use in humans in the U.S. -- has been tested in this country as an anti-cancer therapy since the mid-1970s. Although some early tests of the treatment were promising, the therapy has several drawbacks that have slowed its development. One is the necessity of shining light on targeted cancer cells, which means the therapy is of little use against large, thick tumors, or ones that are buried within tissues.    However, the development of fiber optics -- flexible light-conducting tubes that can transmit laser light -- has enhanced the therapy's potential uses. In the recent study in China, researchers threaded such tubes into patients' bladders through their urinary tracts. Several U.S. research groups are testing photodynamic therapy using a similar approach against tumors in the bronchial tubes of the lungs, bladder cancer and some other cancers.    Photodynamic therapy promises some advantages over alternatives in certain cases, said Bryan Shumaker, a urologist who is testing the therapy with bladder-cancer patients at Detroit's Henry Ford Hospital. For example, he said, a photodynamic therapy variation in which the bladder's entire inner surface is blanketed with laser light may wipe out nascent tumors that are too small to be detected. And the development of injectable, light-emitting chemicals may enable activation of the photosensitizing drug against tumors almost anywhere in the body.    Mice being tested with such treatments literally glow in the dark, Dr. Shumaker said.    U.S. clinical studies of photodynamic therapy currently are suspended because the only supplier of the photosensitizing drug, Johnson andamp; Johnson's Photomedica Inc. unit -- is being sold to Quadra Logic Technologies Inc. of Vancouver, B.C. &quot;We put the project on hold so we could gather together the existing data&quot; on photodynamic therapy for Quadra, a Photomedica spokesman said. Supplies will probably resume in December or January, when Photomedica's proposed sale to Quadra is expected to be completed, he added. </TEXT></DOC>
