The delicate operation, involving federal agents, local policeand even the American Red Cross, unfolded in an unlikely setting: aquiet block in the New York City borough of Queens that includeswarehouses, tenements and humble houses with a view of the EmpireState Building across the East River.   ``It's an old-fashioned neighborhood; most of the residents arehardworking, blue-collar or middle-class people,'' said residentJohn O'Sullivan at a nearby coffee shop. ``Drugs are not within ourvernacular.''   But in a raid on a three-story warehouse last Friday, drugagents found cocaine.   On top of the cocaine packages in the sealed drums were sixinches of a powdery substance, which police soon learned containeda 98 percent concentration of sodium hydroxide _ a chemical used inlye that can eat through concrete. In comparison, said Lt. DougReed of the Police Department's hazardous materials unit, draincleaner has about a 4 percent concentration of sodium hydroxide,known as caustic soda.   The authorities finished recovering the cocaine this morning,cataloguing 10,648 pounds of the drug, said Rick Mercier, a U.S.Customs special agent. Police and Customs officials estimate thecocaine's street value at $80,000 a pound.   It could be the largest seizure to date in New York, and one ofthe five largest cocaine seizures in the nation's history,according to DEA spokeswoman Mary Cooper.   The investigation, begun by U.S. Customs, soon included federaldrug agents, city police, county police and emergency medicalsquads. The Red Cross fed 80 workers on Wednesday night alone.   Police working inside the warehouse wore oxygen masks, 40-poundtanks, and protective suits, the sleeves sealed with tape to twopairs of gloves. The gloves were changed when the chemicals atethrough them, about twice an hour.   The teams worked around-the-clock on the painstaking process ofopening the drums, decontaminating, repackaging, removing thecocaine _ except on Sunday, when New York Marathon runners streamedright past the cordoned-off warehouse.   As it was decontaminated, the cocaine was placed in asemi-trailer truck. Eventually, the truckload will be driven to anincinerator at an undisclosed location.   Mercier said the cocaine could be tainted, despite the plasticthat surrounded it in the drum. It wasn't clear whether any hadmade it onto the streets.   Sodium hydroxide can irritate the skin and respiratory tract andcause blindness. The damage is compounded when it's smoked orinjected.   Investigators were searching for five suspects, believed linkedto the Cali drug cartel. The New York Times reported that policewere searching for Juan Martinez, head of a company called theAranal Corp., which rented the warehouse.   In a simultaneous raid last Friday, agents found thousands ofdrums of sodium hydroxide in a Philadelphia warehouse leased byAranal Corp. Mercier said he had no immediate word of cocaine inthe drums there.</TEXT></DOC>
