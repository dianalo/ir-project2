Unlike the glimmerings of a turnaround in other parts of the computer industry, nearly all the personal-computer heavyweights are registering impressive sales gains. International Business Machines Corp. said it set first-quarter personal-computer sales records. Analysts estimate that IBM sold as much as 80% more of its high-performance PC-AT machines than it did a year ago. Tandy Corp. logged a 62% gain in unit sales of its IBM-compatible computers, strengthening its position as the second-largest supplier of such machines. And Compaq Computer Corp., a maker of more upscale IBM-compatibles, expects its first-quarter sales to have grown by at least 39%.    That's not all. Sales of Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh computers, currently the industry's hottest-selling model, were up at least 30% in the March quarter, helping the company become so cash rich that it was able to declare its first cash dividend this week. Likewise, companies supplying electronic parts to manufacturers and software to users are visibly benefiting from robust personal-computer sales. Moreover, since business picked up late last year, prices of several high-tech stocks, notably Apple and Microsoft Corp., have nearly doubled.    &quot;There's no doubt about it, the industry is alive and well,&quot; says Rod Canion, the president and chief executive of Compaq. &quot;Earlier in the year, we would have predicted growth of about 20% for the industry this year, which isn't a bad number. Now, we're looking at the 25% to 30% range.&quot;    Of course, an unexpected recession or adverse interpretation of the new tax legislation could put a damper on capital spending by large businesses, which account for the bulk of personal-computer purchases. That could cause the projected surge in sales to falter this year. But most analysts and industry experts think it would take a severe recession to stop sales growth altogether.    As of now, IBM, Apple and Compaq all are fanning customer enthusiasm with recent flashy additions to their product lines. Also, personal-computer dealers finally have learned that direct sales methods for marketing large computer systems to business customers are the best way to sell them little computers, too.    Meanwhile, software advances and hardware improvements have recently made personal computers more powerful and easier to use, and thus that much more useful. And, finally, prices have dropped to the point that a fully equipped personal computer can be had for little more than the price of a fancy typewriter, $750 or thereabouts.    Consequently, the machines have come to be considered indispensable office fixtures, rather than executive playthings. &quot;It's happening even faster than many of us thought it would,&quot; says William Gates, the chairman and chief executive of Microsoft, whose 42% stake in the company made him the industry's first billionaire, at least on paper. Microsoft, a software company based in Redmond, Wash., that is best known for supplying the operating-system software for IBM and compatible personal computers, saw its own sales and profit nearly double in the quarter ended March 31.    In contrast, 1985 and most of 1986 marked a painful rite of passage for the young personal-computer business, which, in just a decade, has grown into a $46 billion industry (if software and accessory sales are included). After years of annual growth rates exceeding 62%, expansion abruptly slowed to less than 15% in 1985 and edged up only slightly, to 18% in 1986, as capital spending by big businesses stalled.    &quot;In any other business, that kind of growth rate wouldn't alarm anyone,&quot; says Grant S. Bushee, the executive vice president of Infocorp, a Cupertino, Calif., market-research firm, which expects unit and dollar sales world-wide to increase by 22% this year. The company expects unit sales in the U.S. to grow by 25%. &quot;For the personal-computer business, though, {the slowdown} was a disaster, because expectations were so high that such heady growth would just go on and on.&quot;    The decline in personal-computer sales growth coincided with a more dramatic slump in markets for mainframe computers and contributed to the semiconductor industry's worst downturn ever. Stock market values of many personal-computer companies took a beating along with the shares of their high-tech brethren. Jon Shirley, Microsoft's president and chief operating officer, says the personal-computer industry, which was still growing, was associated unfairly in people's minds with the serious slump in the mainframe and semiconductor industries.    The slower sales growth for personal computers also triggered a shakeout among personal-computer dealers that thinned their ranks by more than a third. And, as if that weren't enough, last year personal-computer prices were driven down by the many clones of IBM's standard-setting PC line of computers. IBM-compatible machines costing as little as one-third as much as IBM's computers by the end of last year had a 75% share of a market that IBM virtually owned in 1984.    &quot;The waters were pretty muddy for a while,&quot; concedes Bruce Burdick, who operates eight ComputerLand Corp. franchised stores in the Kansas City area that so far this year are posting sales gains of about 50%. &quot;The public didn't know what to buy or who to buy it from . . . and the low-cost clones confused everybody.&quot;    As it turned out, the dealer shakeout may have been the best thing that ever happened to the industry. Not only did it weed out weak dealers who couldn't pay their bills or adequately support customers after the sale, but it also forced survivors to reexamine how to sell small computer systems.    Most of them turned to variations of the so-called &quot;outbound&quot; direct sales approach for large business customers that IBM, Digital Equipment Corp. and other big computer concerns have used for years. According to a survey by Oakland, Calif., computer retailing consultant Chad Hill, 85% of all personal-computer dealers now have outbound sales forces. &quot;To sell to business customers, you have to know their business and people so you can tailor the system to their needs,&quot; says Mr. Hill. &quot;You can't do that sitting in a store.&quot;    That formula has worked wonders for Businessland Inc., a chain of 94 dealers based in San Jose, Calif. According to David Norman, Businessland's president and chairman, the direct-sales strategy has enabled the company to grow at a 50% annual rate since its founding in 1982, despite the recent shakeout among dealers. Furthermore, Mr. Norman says, Businessland has been able to defy the industry trend of plummeting retail prices. &quot;Our average system costs $6,500 today, compared with $5,500 a year ago,&quot; he says, largely because Businessland encourages customers to buy computers decked out with special features allowing communication, networking and fancy printing.    ComputerLand, which actually saw sales slide in 1984 and 1985, was able to turn around last year as it focused more on selling &quot;turnkey systems&quot; that bundle everything a customer needs to, say, put out a newsletter, or set up payroll and accounting for a small business.    &quot;All that adds up to higher margins for us, because we're able to package a lot of add-ons and sell support and training,&quot; says Gary Gapp, a ComputerLand senior vice president.    Dealers are only part of the rebound in personal-computer sales, of course. Price and performance improvements, as well as more powerful software, have made machines much more than the &quot;expensive paperweights&quot; they once were called. Besides driving down prices, the makers of IBM clones also advanced standards of performance by adding features IBM hadn't thought of, such as portability, smaller size, faster processing speed and snazzier graphics capabilities.    That has been Compaq's formula for success, and it is epitomized by its Deskpro 386, currently the fastest and most powerful IBM-compatible machine on the market. Compaq designed the computer around Intel Corp.'s most-advanced microprocessor -- a $300 piece of silicon called the 80386. And Compaq did it a full year before IBM will deliver its first 80386 machine. Analysts estimate that Compaq, which doesn't disclose unit sales, has sold about 35,000 of the machines, which are priced from about $7,000 to $9,500. Mr. Canion says they continue to sell well, even now that IBM has unveiled its own version.    With IBM's announcement earlier this month of its second generation of personal computers, however, it has taken the initiative again in setting a standard for others to emulate in high-performance machines designed around Intel microprocessors and Microsoft operating system software. The new Personal System 2 series of products also shows how IBM thinks personal computers will function in relation to larger computers.    There is bound to be some buyer confusion over the two software standards the new machines define, and over compatibility. Many potential buyers will be disappointed that Microsoft's new operating system to tap the new IBM machines' full power won't be available until the middle of next year.    Still, most analysts believe that in the long run -- 1988 and beyond -- the new computers will only invigorate the industry. &quot;These computers will be able to keep up with changes in the technology for a long time to come,&quot; predicts Stewart Alsop, the publisher of PC Letter. &quot;And the fact that the old PC standard will be allowed to survive is good news for the existing clone makers who have a clear vision of their place in the market.&quot;    Software advances, too, have driven computer sales lately, and particularly Apple's Macintosh, which languished for two years after its introduction, in part because there were few powerful business programs that would run on it. That all changed last year with Apple's introduction of a beefed-up Macintosh Plus at about the same time better software became available. And Apple's own recently announced Macintosh SE and Macintosh II products should enable it to maintain its 30% growth in Macintosh unit sales. Indeed, John Sculley, Apple's chairman and president, told analysts this week that the company was counting on more than doubling its revenue, to at least $4 billion by 1990. &quot;I think he's being a bit conservative,&quot; says John Maxwell, an analyst for Dillon Read andamp; Co.    J. Douglas Way, a chemical engineer from Portola Valley, Calif., had been wanting to buy an Apple Macintosh computer to use at the office and finally ordered his this month. What made him buy now? For one thing, he says, &quot;It was easier for me to justify to my management,&quot; now that Apple has introduced two models that can be modified to run programs written for IBM and compatible personal computers. Also, &quot;there's a lot of excitement among technical people because these machines are becoming the equivalent of a mainframe on your desk. Now you can do real work on your own machine.&quot;    All the industry growth is having ripple effects throughout support industries, especially those that supply parts and software. Seagate Technology and Miniscribe Corp., two makers of disk drives for personal computers, have seen profits explode by more than 150% in recent quarters. And chip makers such as Chips and Technologies Inc., which makes sets of chips that most clone-makers use to build IBM-compatible machines are riding the wave as well.    And then, of course, there is Intel, the Santa Clara, Calif., maker of most of the microprocessors used in IBM and compatible personal computers.    According to Jean-Claude Cornet, the general manager of the microprocessor division, demand is such for its 80286 chip -- the heart of IBM's high performance PCAT and three of its new PS/2 models -- that Intel could well ship four million of the chips this year -- as many as it has shipped in the past three years combined. At prices ranging from $30 to $80 each, depending on speed and quantity, &quot;that's a significant part of our revenues,&quot; Mr. Cornet says. Indeed, extra chip sales generated by the personal-computer boom are a big reason the company, which had run up $173.2 million in losses in 1986 on revenue of $1.27 billion, was able to show a small operating profit for the first quarter ended March 28, as revenue shot up 41%.    Microprocessor chips aren't Intel's only contribution to IBM's computers. Adds Mr. Cornet: &quot;In most of the new IBM computers, there are 29 Intel products besides the microprocessor.&quot;    Of course, there are some losers among all the winners. For one thing, much of the sales gains of IBM, Tandy and Compaq, came at the expense of other makers, such as American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Inc., Tandon Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., as well as other less-known companies that made a splash but that now are losing the battle for dealers' shelf space.    And while the home computer market is still an elusive target of personal-computer makers, plunging prices for IBM clones have made life more difficult for companies like Commodore International Ltd. and Atari Inc., which keep trying to crack that market. Ironically, even though Commodore had returned to profitability in recent quarters after a disastrous 1985 and early 1986, the maker of the Amiga personal computer abruptly ousted its chief executive and senior U.S. management within the past week, apparently dissatisfied with their performance.    Both IBM and Apple have let their dealers know that they are expecting stronger commitments of time and resources if dealers are to remain eligible to sell new products carrying higher price tags and dealer profit margins. Meanwhile, Japanese personal-computer makers, which have only recently begun to make inroads in the U.S. market, will be hurt at least temporarily by the punitive duties recently imposed by the Reagan administration.    Indeed, although the industry is only a decade old now, it is mature enough that, as it enters another period of breakneck growth, the chances for an upstart to carve out a piece of the market are slimmer than ever.    &quot;The surge in sales is good news, but for many of us, much of the excitement in the industry is gone now, even with all these new products,&quot; says Richard Shaffer, the publisher of Technologic Computer Letter, a trade publication. That, he says, is because &quot;what we really wanted to know all along was who would win, place and show.&quot; With IBM, Apple, Tandy and Compaq accounting for about three-fourth of all the computers sold during the first three months of this year, Mr. Shaffer concludes: &quot;The horse race is over.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
