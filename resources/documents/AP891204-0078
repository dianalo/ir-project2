A rebel spokesman said the trapped foreigners would be freedTuesday but he said this did not mean the mutineers were giving uptheir fight to oust President Corazon Aquino.   ``We pledged our lives to this cause. We will hold the line tothe last drop of our blood,'' said the spokesman, Capt. Alfred Yen.   Two bombs exploded in the city, injuring two people. It wasunclear if they were related to the coup attempt, which beganFriday and has killed at least 70 people.   Hundreds of Americans and other foreigners were pinned down inhomes and hotels in the post Makati district, where forces loyal toMrs. Aquino contained the mutineers to 22 buildings.   Rebels shot at anyone venturing outside.   ``Literally, we're in the middle,'' said Barbara Julich, a NewYork businesswoman trapped in the Intercontinental Hotel. ``(We're)now low on food. There are babies in the building, and there is nobaby food, and the mothers are hysterical.   ``We saw were a group of nuns trying to walk where the tanksare. They were eventually shot at and took cover.''   At least three people were reported slain in Makati today and 15wounded, including one American, by rebel snipers and in fightingbetween rebel and loyalist forces.   Earlier, spokesmen for the Makati Medical Center said 10 peoplewere killed. They said the discrepancy was due to an error inrecords.   Government troops forced the surrender of more than 600 rebelsSunday, and Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said the coup attempt hadbeen crushed but that it would take several days to complete``mopping up operations.''   This is the sixth and most serious coup attempt against Mrs.Aquino.   Insurgents seized Makati on Saturday, trading fire withgovernment troops and sending bystanders racing for cover.Government forces appeared reluctant to attack for fear of killingforeigners.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Huchel said about 215 Americanswere believed trapped in three hotels in the wealthy district. Anundetermined number of others were believed trapped in luxuryapartments.   Hospital sources identified the American wounded as JeromeWeissburg, who they said was hit in the arm by glass when a bulletshattered the window of his room at the Peninsula Hotel. They didnot know his hometown.   Yen telephoned news organizations in Manila and said foreignerswould be free to leave hotels at 10 a.m. Tuesday (9 p.m. ESTMonday), to dispel any ideas they were held hostage.   The foreigners will be taken to Manila's airport aboard shuttlebuses, Yen said.   At least 70 people have been killed and more than 500 woundedsince mutineers seized several military installations and bombedthe presidential palace Friday, according to the Red Cross.   U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for counterattackingloyalist forces later that day.   On Sunday, loyalist troops fought off a furious attack by therebels on the military headquarters at Camp Aguinaldo, and about600 mutineers surrendered.   About 400 rebels were still occupying Mactan Air Base in Cebu,350 miles south of Manila. Their leader refused to give up andthreatened to blow up the base's planes.   Officials arrested one coup participant who approached thedefense chief with a grenade during a news conference.   Also today, an explosion occurred in the compound of the CentralBank, the equivalent of the Federal Reserve. There were no injuries.   A second bomb went off in the Ermita entertainment district,damaging an unoccupied minibus and shattering windows. Two womenwere injured by flying glass.   In the morning, the estimated 390 rebel holdouts in Makati _members of the army's First Scout Ranger Regiment _ refused appealsto surrender and fired at soldiers and civilians who approachedtheir strongholds.   The mutinous soldiers claim Mrs. Aquino, swept to power in a1986 military-civilian uprising that ousted President FerdinandMarcos, has failed to deal effectively with the country's Communistinsurgency and economic problems.   One of the coup leaders was Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, acashiered lieutenant colonel who once supported Mrs. Aquino butlater led an August 1987 attempt to overthrow her. He remained atlarge.   The city's international airport reopened today but domestic airservice was indefinitely postponed. Schools were closed butgovernment employees were ordered to return to work except in theMakati area.   Officials reported shortages of food and fuel from interruptionscaused by the fighting.   More than 10,000 people fled their homes to escape the fightingand were housed in schools, churches and other refugee centers.   Most provincial garrisons did not join the mutiny, but therewere indications of widespread support among junior andmiddle-grade officers.   In Manila, guards arrested an army sergeant who tried to bomb anews conference held by Ramos and military chief Gen. Renato DeVilla, an official said today. Sgt. Romy Aquino (no relation to thepresident) was moving toward the officials with a grenade whenarrested Sunday afternoon, said Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo, chief ofthe military's Civil Relations Service.</TEXT></DOC>
