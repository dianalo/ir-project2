The suit for the first time had raised the question ofwhether a reporter's promise of confidentiality is legallyenforceable and whether a newspaper that breaks that promiseis protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</LP><TEXT>   The case against the Minneapolis Star Tribune and the St.Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch had gone to the U.S. SupremeCourt, which ruled in 1990 that the suit didn't violate thenewspapers' First Amendment rights. It was then returned tothe Minnesota Supreme Court which decided the case on statelaw issues.   First Amendment lawyers had mixed reactions to the stateSupreme Court decision. Some predicted the ruling wouldencourage similar suits in every state and give sources a newtool to manipulate the news. Other lawyers called the rulingdisappointing but said it would have little impact on therelationship between reporters and their sources.   Writing for a unanimous court, Judge John Simonett ruledthat Dan Cohen, a public relations executive, was entitled to$200,000 in damages because he had relied on promises ofconfidentiality from reporters at the Minneapolis paper,owned by Cowles Media Co. and the St. Paul paper, owned byKnight-Ridder Inc. Mr. Cohen sued the newspapers after theybroke a promise not to identify him as the source ofembarrassing information about a candidate for Minnesota'slieutenant governorship in 1982.   &quot;In reliance on the promise of anonymity, (Mr.) Cohenturned over (documents) and, when the promises to keep hisname confidential were broken, he lost his job,&quot; JudgeSimonett said.   Jane Kirtley, executive director of The ReportersCommittee for Freedom of the Press in Washington, a watchdoggroup, said the ruling is bad news for reporters because now&quot;every state court will have to deal with whether itsconstitution or state statutes&quot; protect reporters from breachof contract actions filed by sources.   Noting that the state high court suggested that thenewspapers could have referred to Mr. Cohen as &quot;someone closeto the opposing gubernatorial ticket,&quot; Ms. Kirtley said thedecision &quot;smacks of the courts being super editors.&quot; She saidthat unidentified sources might sue reporters if readersguessed their identity. &quot;This really could turn into a realnightmare,&quot; Ms. Kirtley said.   Bruce Sanford, a First Amendment specialist at Baker andamp;Hostetler in Washington, said he fears the decision willprompt sources to ask reporters to write stories a certainway or make other demands that encroach on a newspaper'seditorial integrity.   Mr. Sanford says about six similar suits have been filedsince 1988, when a jury awarded the damages to Mr. Cohen.   But Paul Hannah of the St. Paul law firm Hannah andamp; Zenner,which represented the St. Paul Pioneer, argued that the smallnumber of similar pending suits shows that the ruling willhave little impact. The Minnesota Supreme Court ruling, heargued, is a fact-specific opinion &quot;which will probably nothave much precedential&quot; value.   &quot;These are difficult cases to bring,&quot; Mr. Hannah added.&quot;You need a very specific, provable promise.&quot;   In a prepared statement, the Minneapolis Star Tribunesaid, &quot;We are obviously disappointed in the decision, but werespect it.&quot;   ---   TEST DRILLING FOR DIAMONDS in a state park is permissible,court rules.   A federal appeals court in St. Louis ruled that commercialuse of a public recreation area isn't prohibited so long asit is temporary and &quot;minimal.&quot;   In a 2-1 decision, the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals threw out a lower court decision that had stoppeddiamond test-drilling in the Crater of Diamonds State Park inArkansas. A lower court had permanently enjoined the testing,accepting the argument of the Sierra Club and others that thetesting was a &quot;conversion of use&quot; of the park fromrecreational to commercial purposes.   Under the Federal Land and Water Conservation Act, publicrecreational lands that receive funds provided for by the actcan't be used for purposes unrelated to public recreation.The lower court ruled that the drilling was a conversion ofuse and that by allowing the drilling to take place, thefederal Interior Department was acting arbitrarily andcapriciously.   But the appeals court noted that the testing at issue inthe case would only involve drilling 30 holes to a depth of1,000 feet in an area of about 50 feet by 100 feet for aperiod of about 12 weeks. The Interior Department's decisionto allow such minimal and temporary non-conforming use &quot;in noway ushers in a parade of horribles culminating in full-blowncommercial mining,&quot; the appeals court ruled. &quot;The park'spurpose is by no means turned nonrecreational.&quot;   A partner in one of the mining companies that haveprovided funds for the drilling said he hopes the testing cannow proceed. Limited drilling was done before the lower courtissued its injunction in August 1990 and demonstrated that alarge formation or &quot;pipe&quot; exists in the park, said JeanBoulle, a partner in the Arkansas Diamond Development Corp.   But an attorney for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fundsaid he and other attorneys involved in the case willdetermine whether to ask the appeals court for a re-hearingof the case or ask the lower court to consider other issuesin the case. &quot;The controversy will continue,&quot; said JimStanley, the Sierra Club lawyer.   Opponents of the drilling worry that the appeals courtruling may lead to similar conversions of public lands.   ---   CLIENTS ARE GETTING BILLED more frequently for legal work,study shows.   Billing cycles have become shorter in each of the pastfive years, according to a study by Hildebrandt Inc., aSomerville, N.J. consulting firm. Six years ago a heftyamount of legal work, 46.2%, remained unbilled for at least90 days after the work was performed by attorneys. Last year,bills sent after at least 90 days fell to 28.1%, the studyshowed.   Lawyers familiar with the move to bill and collect feesfaster attribute it only partly to the effect of therecession on cash-hungry law firms. In recent years, lawfirms have increasingly tried to run themselves likecorporations.   Michael E. Phenner, managing partner of the Chicago lawfirm Hopkins andamp; Sutter, noted that 20 years ago many law firmsbilled their clients only once a year. In the 1980s, theymoved to quarterly and often monthly billing. &quot;It comes downto better communication with the client,&quot; Mr. Phenner said.   Clients, for the most part, have welcomed the change inbilling frequency because it makes it easier to budget legalcosts and stay on top of what their lawyers are doing. Thereare fewer surprises and arguments over prices.   General Motors Corp. has pushed aggressively for shorterbilling cycles. The Detroit auto maker's vice president andgeneral counsel, Harry J. Pearce, recalled once waitingseveral years for a bill from a law firm. The laggard lawfirm, which he declined to name, was fired. &quot;That makes ithard to question the completeness or incompleteness&quot; becausememories have faded, he said. The company feeds billing datainto a computer program that projects yearly legal costs.   Large law firms of more than 300 lawyers handling complexlitigation take slightly longer than smaller law firms tochurn out bills, said David Jarcik, who watches lawdepartment finances for Motorola Inc. in Schaumburg, Ill.Nevertheless, he added, most large firms usually send billsevery month or month and a half.   Maryellen Cattani, senior vice president and generalcounsel for American President Companies Ltd. in SanFrancisco, said she was recently taken aback when a firm tookthree months to send a bill. &quot;It's just kind of odd,&quot; shesaid. &quot;It really is out of the normal course.&quot;   ---   HIGH-LEVEL PERSONNEL MOVES expected at the JusticeDepartment.   President Bush is expected to nominate George Terwilligerto be deputy attorney general, the department's No. 2 job.Mr. Terwilliger has been holding the post in an interimcapacity. A career prosecutor and former U.S. attorney fromVermont, he has advised Attorney General William Barr on suchpolitically sensitive matters as the BCCI case and theHaitian refugee situation.   Meanwhile, speculation has increased that James Rill,assistant attorney general in charge of the AntitrustDivision, will leave by year end. Lawyers familiar with thedivision predict that once Mr. Rill completes a revision ofthe unit's internal merger-enforcement guidelines, he willreturn to private practice. Mr. Rill, who has tried to revivea division slashed nearly in half during the Reaganadministration, said he has no immediate plans to leave.   There are also openings for the posts of assistantattorneys general in charge of environmental and tax matters.The post on the environment was supposed to go to New Yorklawyer James Benkard, but his expected nomination has beenstalled for months. Conservative activists at the WashingtonLegal Foundation take credit for blocking Mr. Benkard, whomthey consider too sympathetic to environmentalists. Mr.Benkard said he is still a candidate but expressedfrustration over the delay.</TEXT></DOC>
