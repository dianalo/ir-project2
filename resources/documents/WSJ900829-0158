ManvilleForest Products Corp., a unit of Manville, will operate theunit.   A spokeswoman declined to give terms or details. Visypackhad 1989 sales of about US$140 million.</LP><TEXT>   Manville said its debt covenants required that the companyreinvest proceeds from the sale of its refractory ceramicfiber business in foreign operations. Manville sold therefractory fiber business to Morgan Crucible Co. in June.Terms weren't disclosed, but the company reported asecond-quarter gain of about $20 million from the sale.   Visypack is the first major acquisition Manville has madesince the company became embroiled in debate over the fundingof the Manville Personal Injury Trust. It indicates that thecompany will proceed with its plans to grow by acquisitionand capital improvements.   The trust, which was set up to pay the company'sasbestos-related health claims after Manville emerged frombankruptcy-law protection in 1988, has run short of cash.Some plaintiffs' attorneys have suggested that instead ofemploying its $1 billion of cash and unused credit lines toexpand its businesses, Manville should give some of the moneyto the trust as a prepayment of its obligations.   Company officials have argued that the company's growthand vitality are in the long-term interest of the trust --which owns about 80% of Manville's stock on a fully dilutedbasis -- and its beneficiaries. That growth would be stymied,Manville executives argue, if the company's assets are usedto pay off trust obligations early rather than buildoperating units.   Visypack, a dominant carton maker in Australia, adds tothe company's growing portfolio of overseas paper productsoperations. Manville acquired DRG Cartons Ltd. of Bristol,England, in April and Fiskeby Board AB of Norrkoping, Sweden,in June. The company also owns two paper mills and threecontainer plants in Brazil.</TEXT></DOC>
