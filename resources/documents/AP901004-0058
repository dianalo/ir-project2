Gayer made public on Wednesday a letter from FBI DirectorWilliam Sessions to a congressman saying that ``the issue ofhomosexual conduct by employees of the FBI raises serious policyconsiderations'' involving ``public trust and confidence.''Sessions also wrote that he was unaware of any openly homosexualagents.   A federal magistrate ordered Wednesday that Sessions must saywhether he had anything to do with revoking Buttino's securityclearance.   Buttino, 45, was fired in June after 20 years with the FBI. Hissecurity clearance, required for all agents, had been revoked theprevious month.   In papers seeking to dismiss his suit, the Justice Departmentsaid Buttino's clearance was lifted not because he was homosexual,but because he had lied repeatedly to FBI investigators and placedhimself in a position that was vulnerable to coercion.   Buttino said those explanations are a pretext for ananti-homosexual policy that the FBI is unwilling to acknowledge. Hetold reporters Wednesday that he has learned through contacts inWashington that the FBI investigates and dismisses 50 homosexuals ayear.   The only lie he told - in hopes of saving his career - was todeny initially to investigators in 1988 that he had written aletter to another person that indicated his homosexuality, Buttinosaid. The letter was forwarded to the FBI by an anonymous person.   Buttino said he met with investigators two months later andvolunteered that he had written the letter and that he washomosexual.   Buttino's lawyer sought permission to question Sessions aboutthe FBI's policies and about the director's meeting early this yearwith Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House JudiciarySubcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights.   Edwards later sent Sessions a letter mentioning that they haddiscussed Buttino's case and asking about the FBI's policies onhomosexuals.   U.S. Magistrate Wayne Brazil said he had seen no evidence in thecase that would justify requiring the Sessions to submit toquestioning.   But Brazil said Sessions must submit a sworn statement inwriting within 30 days saying whether he had any involvement in thedecision to revoke Buttino's clearance.   Gayer gave reporters Sessions' Sept. 6 letter to Edwards inwhich the director denied that homosexual conduct was automaticgrounds for firing.   ``However, where sexual conduct, whether homosexual orheterosexual, reflects a lack of judgment or discretion or asusceptibility to undue influence or duress, the granting orretention of a security clearance would not be consistent with theinterests of national security,'' Sessions wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
