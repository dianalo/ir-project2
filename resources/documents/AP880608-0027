The NSF said scientists at the government-funded NationalSuperconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State Universitysucceeded Monday in bending a narrow, high-energy beam of neonnuclei so that it flew out of the cyclotron cleanly and hit astainless steel target.   That success, the NSF said, means the K800 cyclotron is readyfor a series of atom-smashing experiments that could guidephysicists to fundamental rules governing subatomic matter. It ishoped the studies eventually will lead to a better understanding ofthe forces directing cosmic events, such as the explosions ofstars, or supernovas.   The energy of the test beam fired this week was 360 millionelectron volts, but the machine is capable of accelerating nucleito energies approaching 8 billion electron volts. By comparison,the world's second most powerful heavy-ion cyclotron, GANIL inCaen, France, has accelerated beams to energies of 4 billionelectron volts.   The U.S. test means that precision beams of heavy nuclei can nowbe directed into laboratories at the East Lansing, Mich., facilityfor use in further experiments, the NSF said.   Scientists generated the K800 cyclotron's first high-energy beamin February, using its superconducting magnet to accelerateelectrically charged helium and carbon nuclei in a tight spiral.Within the 7-foot-diameter confines of the cyclotron's magneticfield, the nuclei gradually attained a speed of more than 60,000miles per second. The latest test succeeded in targeting a beamconsisting of the cores of heavier atoms, opening the door to awider array of discoveries.   ``The K800 is unique for both the intensity and the uniformityof the beam of nuclei it can generate,'' said Henry G. Blosser, whooriginated the superconducting accelerator concept and whoco-directs the facility along with MSU physics professor Sam Austin.   Blosser said the machine, for which construction began in 1980,``can accelerate a beam of nuclei of even the heaviest naturallyoccurring element, uranium, to speeds that will lead to nuclearreactions that have never been observed before.''   ``In comparison with pre-1980s cyclotrons, it's like being ableto accelerate cannon balls instead of BBs,'' he said.   When a heavy nucleus in the cyclotron beam approaches thenucleus of a target atom with sufficient speed to overcome theirelectrical repulsion _ or about 20,000 miles per second _ thenuclei can come together and overlap for an instant. Theoverlapping nuclei might fly apart almost unchanged, might ejectneutrons and protons to form a more stable combined nucleus, ormight even break up into a number of medium-sized fragments.Scientists expect more than 30 nuclear particles to be emitted insome of the more violent collisions.   A complex array of electronic radiation detectors linked tocomputers will record the outcome of the collisions. Physicistshope that by studying the effects of temperature, pressure andenergy of impact, they will be able to define fundamentalrelationships governing nuclear matter and reactions, similar tothe thermodynamic and quantum mechanical equations that have beenestablished for chemical reactions among molecules.   Austin said the collisions of heavy nuclei will lead ``toextremes of density and temperature as great as those that causestars to explode, and which occurred in the `Big Bang' that createdthe universe.'' Experiments with the new cyclotron may possiblyeven lead to the creation of new, heavier atomic elements, he said.   While cyclotrons and other particle accelerators are designedand operated primarily for physics research, the chemical isotopesand radioactive elements that can be produced are also used inmedical research and treatment.   The NSF has supported cyclotron research at MSU since 1961. Anearlier model, the K500, went into operation in 1982 and has beenhost for more than 275 scientists from 47 institutions. It was thefirst superconducting cyclotron in the world, using, like thesister K800, titanium-niobium alloy magnets which lost allresistance to electricity when chilled with liquid helium to minus450 degrees Fahrenheit, near absolute zero. The 1988 operatingbudget for the entire laboratory is $7.1 million.</TEXT></DOC>
