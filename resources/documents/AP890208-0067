The state ``explicitly considered sex'' when it overhauled itscivil service classifications in 1930-31, said William Dickens, alabor economist who was the first witness at the trial Tuesday.   Dickens, an associate professor of economics at the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley, cited a 1930 report recommending the state``pay somewhat higher for those occupations filled predominantly bymen.''   Dickens was the leadoff witness for the California StateEmployees Association, which is suing the state on behalf of 60,000to 70,000 past and present female employees.   Deputy Attorney General Richard Tullis defended the state's wagesystem, calling California ``a very progressive state.''   U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel, hearing the case withouta jury, is limiting testimony in the first phase of the trial to theintent and effects of state policies in the 1930s, when the currentwage system is said to have originated.   The union must prove that when the state's Civil ServiceCommission reclassified jobs and pay scales it deliberately setwages for women at a lower rate than for men.   It must then prove that that early policy accounts for pay gapsexisting at least through the 1970s.   Lawyers for the state deny it ever had a policy of intentionalpay discrimination and say any trace of bias was eliminated in areorganization of job classifications in 1937-38.   Dickens said the changes in state pay classifications in 1937-38were no more than an attempt to ``refine the system,'' while leavingthe basic structure in place.   State lawyers say damages in the case could run into the billionsof dollars, an estimate the union calls highly inflated.</TEXT></DOC>
