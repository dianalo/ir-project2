<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-91-0437 </DOCNO><TEXT>A study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the installationof two cogenerators to cover demand during the normal operating cyclesof a plant producing particle board. A computer program, VAN (net presentworth) was used in the analysis of three scenarios: 8% annual inflation,0% inflation with no fuel price variation and 1% reduction in electricityrates, 0% inflation with fixed costs. Interest rates were set at 7%.The method employed in this real case, cost-benefit analysis, a practicalexample indicating relevant reference parameters and technical alternatives,was designed as a rapid, accurate and efficient approach in the analysisof other, similar, feasibility studies.</TEXT></DOC>
