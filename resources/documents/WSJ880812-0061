The No. 1 auto maker said in March it would discontinue the model, but didn't set a date until this week.    Separately, the eight major U.S. auto makers expect to build 98,658 cars this week, up 19% from the revised count last week and 25% ahead of the same period a year ago. But year-to-date auto production is expected to fall 5% to 4,308,144 cars from 4,536,169 a year earlier.    Ford Motor Co.'s Wayne, Mich., car-assembly plant is scheduled to work overtime tomorrow and Chrysler's Toledo and St. Louis No. 2 assembly plants will work two overtime shifts next Saturday.    ---           This    Last    Yr.
