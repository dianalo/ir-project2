CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   These days are ``a time of special grace,'' saythe U.S. Roman Catholic bishops. They say changes in Eastern Europesignal not only new freedoms for peoples but enable conversion ofarms budgets to enhancing life and peace.   That theme was sounding in many religious circles.   With the fading of the Cold War, the Global Mission MinistryUnit of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) applauded moves for mutualtroop reductions and hailed the surge ``for freedom, for truth''and international concord.   It should replace ``East-West competition with a new partnershipfor peace and justice _ in Europe and the world,'' the Catholicbishops said.   Curbing the arms race and putting a greater share of resourcesinto easing social ills and improving the lot of the poor has beena longtime plea of most mainline churches.   The changed circumstances accentuated that cause.   The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America's social-actioncommission says the ``new opportunities for peace'' open the wayfor redirecting military expenditures to humanitarian purposes.   Representatives of major Protestant and Eastern OrthodoxChurches in the the National Council of Churches were expected tospeak out on the matter at a meeting May 16-18 in Pittsburgh.   In one of several recent statements on social policies urgingthe shift of arms spending to alleviate human needs at home andabroad, the 53-bishop board of the U.S. Catholic Conference said:   ``We thank a providential God for the grace-filled time in whichwe live _ for the advent of a new era.'' Declaring that ``this newmoment'' has swept away years of ``stultifying controls'' inEastern Europe, the statement added:   ``We see signs of a deeper movement of the Spirit; a reassertionof the transcendent, of a deeper understanding of the full meaningof what it is to be human.''   Americans have ``an historic opportunity to assist'' the newlyfreed peoples in rebuilding their societies,'' the mid-Aprilstatement said, adding:   ``With a reordering of national priorities, we will be able todo our part in this region of the world while at the same timemeeting other unmet human and social needs both at home and in thedeveloping world.''   The Presbyterians, in a statement proposed for their generalassembly in June, said they rejoiced at the crumbling of ``barriersbetween East and West'' and added:   ``We give thanks for the strong and courageous leadership of themany Christians who were at the forefront of the movements forfreedom, for truth, for human rights. ...   ``We strongly support moves in your country and ours for troopreductions in Europe, those of the United States, the Soviet Unionand those of your individual countries.''   Bishops of the Catholic conference, in another statement putbefore the House and Senate budget committees in late March, notedthat they have long urged less military spending and ``greaterinvestment in human needs,'' adding:   ``These concerns take on added urgency given the dramaticchanges'' in the world, ``the pressing needs of new democracies,and the continuing reality of hunger, homelessness and poverty inour own land and around the world.''   The bishops specifically questioned going ahead with theStrategic Defense Initiative, called ``Star Wars,'' the stealthbomber and MX missile, saying many experts consider them of``dubious'' value.   Military outlays can undermine human welfare, the bishops said,adding, ``We see the tragic consequences of misplaced priorities inour shelters and soup kitches, in our hospitals, parishes andschools.''   In a letter to members of the congressional committees,Archbishop Roger Mahony of Los Angles, chairman of an internationalpolicy committee, and Bishop James Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, headof a domestic policy committee, said:   ``We can support democracy abroad and fight hunger andhomelessness at home. We can also address the problems ofinadequate health care and education in our own land.''   But that demands cutting unnecessary spending, including reducedmilitary expenditures ``in light of the diminishing threat'' and``transition to an economy less dependent on military spending,''the bishops said.   Abroad, they said, ``a major shift from military assistance toeconomic aid ... is essential if we are to meet our internationalmoral obligations.''   The federal budget was termed ``not just a fiscal blueprint, butalso a moral document'' reflecting the conscience of America aboutits responsibilities.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs May 11.</NOTE></DOC>
