Gordon Crovitz appropriately expresses outrage over thecriminal-justice system's lax treatment of Brian Lawrence(&quot;Time to Apply the Lessons of Iraq to Criminals at Home,&quot;Rule of Law, op-ed page, Jan. 23). Unfortunately, hiscriticism exemplifies the common perception that there is azero-sum game between law enforcement and protection ofindividual rights.   Mr. Lawrence's rap sheet displays, above all, theinability of the system to deal with his and others' numerousoffenses. Overload in the courts, the prisons and theprosecutors' offices leads to plea bargains for sentencessuch as &quot;conditional discharge&quot; and &quot;time served.&quot;Ironically, the lack of resources in the system also leads totransgressions of individual rights, as suspects learn thatthey will fare better by plea bargaining than by sitting injail until time for a trial is found.</LP><TEXT>   By allocating more resources to the system we can betterfulfill societal expectations of adequate punishment, as wellas societal ideals of procedural fairness. Mr. Crovitz'sattack on individual rights diverts attention from thisfundamental problem of resource allocation.   It is far from clear that vagrancy laws or elimination ofthe exclusionary rule will do anything but exacerbate theproblem. It is more clear that such measures beckon to thedays of rounding up the usual suspects, illegal violations ofthe sanctity of the home and such brutality as involuntarysubjection to the stomach pump. When Mr. Crovitz writes ofapplying the lessons of Iraq to our criminal-justice system,surely he does not mean adopting Iraqi standards of fairtreatment.   Mark D. Robins   Chestnut Hill, Mass.   ---   I'll concede that the &quot;judicial experimentation&quot; of the1960s may have some responsibility for the situation DistrictAttorney Robert Morgenthau accurately describes as &quot;At thispoint we're closer to anarchy than to respect for the law.&quot;But Mr. Crovitz misses a key point.   If the people of this nation wish to &quot;insure domestictranquility,&quot; it will be necessary to do exactly what we'redoing in respect to Iraq. Specifically, it will be necessaryto assign billions of dollars and thousands of bodies to a&quot;war against crime.&quot; Mr. Crovitz suggests that judges simplylock &quot;away career criminals until they were too old to strikeagain.&quot; That solution sounds great, but where will thesefelons be housed, especially in a state such as Californiawhere, on Nov. 5, 1990, the voters disapproved bond issuesfor new prisons, jails and juvenile facilities?   If and when the citizenry becomes truly concerned aboutcrime in the streets, we're going to need more policeofficers to answer those calls that now go unanswered, moreprosecutors to appear in those courts that are now withoutprosecutors, and more probation and parole officers tomaintain surveillance over the thousands of offenders, mostlyconvicted felons, who wander about our streets committing newcrimes.   If and when the citizenry wishes to &quot;insure domestictranquility,&quot; it will be necessary for the federal governmentto protect our borders against the deluge of drugs enteringour country and which are responsible, directly orindirectly, for 80% of the crime.   It may be convenient to place the blame with the&quot;domestic-policy elite of judges,&quot; but it's also simplistic.Order will be restored to our communities, along with respectfor the law, only when the taxpayers are willing to investmassive funds and to commit themselves to something otherthan &quot;lip service.&quot;   Robert E. Keldgord   Chief Probation Officer   County of Sacramento   Sacramento, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
