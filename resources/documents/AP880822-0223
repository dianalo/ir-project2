Little ideas that the imagination can pick up and handle. Theshow for the most part leaves the panoramic views to ``Nova'' andother ambitious programs that try to bring science to the public.   ``A lot of people make the mistake of imagining that science istoo tough for them to get,'' says John Angier, one of the twoexecutive producers of the science program hosted by Peter Graves.   ``Anybody can get science. It's about the world and how theworld works. To watch `Discover,' there is no need to know anyscience. We always make sure whatever background you need is rightin the story.   ``We emphasize human interest. We do a medical story through theeyes and experience of an individual. We follow the progress of apatient over a long period of time.''   Graham Chedd, Angier's partner, says, ``People tend to think ofscientists as dull, boring or whacked out. There are crazies outthere. There also are articulate, interesting people doing weirdand wonderful things. All they want to do is find out aboutsomething or other. We're one of the few places they canconsistently tell their stories on TV.''   Chedd continues, ``I don't want to knock `Nova' but they onlyget to do 10 or 12 new productions a year. They have to pick bigsubjects. We turn out 20 to 25 new stories; we can pick little onesif we like.''   ``Discover'' has five shows in a season, monthly, starting inOctober.   Angier studied physics and likes animal and aviation stories.Chedd, who studied biology, prefers space and medical stories. Theymake an eclectic team, poring over academic, scientific and medicalresearch journals, fishing in deep waters for scientific game ofall sizes.   ``A sub-part of a story published in a journal may become ourstory,'' Chedd says.   When they heard about some guy in western Massachusetts who wasdoing lightning research, they sent their people there, then westto a mountain in New Mexico which has the most lightning in thecountry.   While in New Mexico, one of them happened to run into peopledoing a dinosaur dig, looking for a 140-foot seismosaurus, anotherstory lead for ``Discover.''   Chedd and Angier, both born in England, met through ``Nova,''which Angier calls ``the granddaddy of science broadcasting in thiscountry.   ``I was one of the first producers on that. I came from the BBC.Graham was our first science editor. He was doing something for theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science in Washingtonand started advising us on science content.''   They formed Chedd-Angier Production Company in 1980 in Boston.   ``We went along to the publisher of Discover magazine andsuggested to him a TV companion and that we make it. To ouramazement, he listened to us,'' Angier says.   The TV show mentions the magazine and the magazine mentions theshow, but stories in the two are different.   ``Discover'' started life in 1981-82 as a commercial TV programto be syndicated. ``It was a fabulously expensive way ofdistributing,'' Angier says. ``That's why our series eventuallymoved to public television.''   Chedd says the audience for ``Discover'' has consistently grown.   ``Independent production companies in the documentary field areusually a free-lance producer with an assistant,'' Angier says.``We're relatively unusual in that we have 35 people working,including 10 to 15 producers. In Hollywood there are giants, butthey're usually entertainment. As far as I know, there's no othercompany like ours.''   Chedd-Angier also does stories for ``Nova'' and scienceproductions for corporations. They currently have in production 26half-hour educational shows about statistics, at the first-yearcollege level.   GTE, which is underwriting ``Discover'' for the fourth season,sends several million free teachers' guides and activity sheets toschools which use the show in science teaching.   Chedd-Angier also is working on a 10-part series on the globalenvironment and planning an eight-part series about molecularbiology and genetic engineering, both with WGBH in Boston for 1991.   Both men still do some on-site producing for ``Discover.''   ``I was doing a story about the recovery of Mount St. Helens,''Angier says. ``It turns out one of the chief ways in which natureis rebuilding itself there is by means of gophers. They dig throughthe hard core of ash and bring soil to the surface and plants cangrow in it.   ``I said to a scientist working there, `What we need is to get ashot of gophers digging. How on earth are we going to do this?'   ``He said, `They'll dig because they dig all the time.'''   Angier pessimistically bet him a case of beer that the gopherswouldn't cooperate with the cameras. He discovered that one reasongophers are such good diggers is that they are always practicing.They got nothing for their ``Discover'' appearance, but thescientist got his beer.   ``He was right. We got all the shots we wanted.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Sept. 4</NOTE></DOC>
