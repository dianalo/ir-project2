 It was a close call, but he'd pickeda machine and a company that were winners, and he felt pretty good about it.andM;Then came &quot;The Big Price Cut.&quot; A week and a half after his 1,500-plusnotebooks were paid for.andM;The price dropped so sharply that even though other vendors were also cuttingtheir prices, the machine he'd chosen was an even clearer winner at its new,low price.andP;  Or would have been, if he'd paid that price, or anything like it.andM;So he called up his stalwart corporate rep at the vendor -- a man who hadbecome a fixture in his office during the evaluations.andP;  A man who would &quot;doanything to make this deal go through.&quot; A man who promised that &quot;I'll be atyour side as long as you own these machines.&quot;andM;Well, not quite.andP;  Because what my friend wanted was some money back.andP;  Surely,he said, the rep knew this price cut was coming.andP;  Nope.andM;Surely, the rep could get the company to adjust its per-machine price on thebuy, giving his company some cash back -- the difference, across 1,500-plusmachines and including the quantity discount he'd gotten, was around amillion bucks -- or at least a big credit, against which he'd happily takemore machines.andP;  Nope.andM;Surely, he ...andP;  Nope.andM;A deal was a deal.andP;  Besides, Mr. By-Your-Side said, my friend should know&quot;prices are always dropping in this business.&quot;andM;OK, a deal is a deal.andP;  The price had been set a month and a half before thecut.andP;  The machines had been delivered over the following three weeks.andP;  Thecompany had paid the vendor's bill within 10 days.andP;  The deal was done.andP;  Fini.andO;Over.andM;Two questions arise: How would you feel if you bought 1,500 notebook PCs, anda few weeks later your boss picks up The Wall Street Journal and reads thatthe price on those machines just fell by a million bucks?andP;  Do you think myfriend is going to deal with that vendor again?andM;It was a stupid response from a PC manufacturer not known for doing stupidthings.andP;  Some kind of price accommodation should have been made.andP;  Thelong-term value of a customer exceeds, always, the value of any one sale.andM;But my friend wasn't very smart, either.andP;  Because if he'd negotiated just alittle harder, he could have built some price protection into that contract.andM;I began recommending to corporate clients about three years ago that theydemand price protection in large-scale PC buys.andM;And why not?andP;  Dealers get price protection: If a supplier drops the price onunits a dealer has in stock during the first 30 to 60 days (often longer)after the goods are delivered, that supplier makes good the difference to thedealer.andP;  Otherwise, dealers wouldn't stock much: They know prices are goingto fall, and they can't afford to get pinched in the middle.andM;That's nothing new.andP;  It's been a staple of many industries for a long time.andM;So why shouldn't large national-account customers get at least as goodtreatment as storefront retailers?andP;  Especially in a time when PC prices arein free-fall?andP;  Particularly when corporations routinely buy 25 to a 100 timesas many units as most retailers?andM;At first, vendors laughed at my clients who asked for price protection intheir procurements.andP;  But not for long: The guys who laughed didn't get thedeals.andM;Now, many corporations demand, and get, fixed-period price protection onalmost all their multiple-unit PC purchases.andP;  With those few lines still soldonly through retailers, manufacturers have to back up the dealer, to makesure it sticks.andM;Vendors hate this.andP;  One national-accounts rep told me I was &quot;ruining thebusiness&quot; by suggesting his company treat a client of mine this way.andM;Big deal.andM;If you're not demanding price protection on your purchases, you're wastingmoney.andP;  Ask for a guarantee that for, say, 90 days after delivery, you'll berefunded an amount equal to the percentage discount off the old list price,should list prices fall.andM;And start sleeping a little better.andP;  You don't ask, you don't get.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
