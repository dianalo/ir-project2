(Cover Story)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Nass, Richard.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The cost of reduced instruction set computer (RISC) workstationsis still significantly higher than the cost of microcomputers in1991 but a new chip set design by Tera Microsystems Inc promisesto reduce that gap.andP;  The new chip set uses 50 percent fewer chipsthat other scalable processor architecture (SPARC) workstationchip sets.andP;  SCU and IOC chips will sample late in the quarter;production begins in the 4th quarter.andP;  The laptop suitableconfiguration will be priced at $400 each in lots of 5,000.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Tera Microsystems Inc.
