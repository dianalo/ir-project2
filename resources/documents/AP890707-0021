But even before Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir bowed to pressureon his right and set tough conditions for elections on the West Bankand in Gaza, the outlook for success was not bright.   The Palestine Liberation Organization, whose implicit support isessential, had denounced the plan as a ploy to block a Palestinianstate.   Other Arabs were less than enthusiastic as well. And while theBush administration supports Shamir's approach, it does so only onpractical grounds.   After decades of frustration, the idea is to get Israelis andArabs to talk about the future of the territories on the theory thatnegotiations develop their own momentum, leading sometimes tostartling results.   Under President Jimmy Carter's persistent mediation, forinstance, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin agreed at Camp Davidin 1978 to give up all of Sinai, its airfields and his country'sonly oil resources in exchange for peace with Egypt.   Begin, like Shamir, had the reputation of being a hard-liner. Butfor the sake of peace with the largest Arab country Begin gave upall the land and forced Israeli settlers to abandon their homes andtowns in the desert.   The State Department may have had this history in mind when ittried Thursday to smooth over the conditions Shamir agreed to a dayearlier in Tel Aviv at the nudging of Ariel Sharon and other Likudhard-liners.   Seeking to draw a distinction between a political party'sdeclaration and a government position, spokesman Richard Boucheremphasized that the election plan was approved in May by the IsraeliCabinet.   He said the United States was dealing with the Israeligovernment, and not with a political party whose partisandeclarations do not advance the peace process, ``particularly ifthey appear to be more restrictive or impose conditions.''   The U.S. spokesman urged Palestinians to participate in theelection after fleshing out the details with the Israelis.   But in Tunis, where the PLO has its headquarters, a spokesmansaid Shamir's terms slammed the door on the peace process. ``Theseefforts now face total failure,'' Ahmed Abdul-Rahman said.   The elections would produce Palestinian leaders to negotiate fiveyears of local self-rule for the 1.4 million Arabs who live on theWest Bank and in Gaza. At the conclusion of this trial period,Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinians would work out an overallsettlement.   Theoretically, all options would be open.   But Shamir has again ruled out a Palestinian state _ a position,not incidentally, the United States also takes.   He also ruled out yielding territory or stopping Jews fromsettling in the areas. Moreover, the elections would be held onlyafter violence ceased.   The PLO response was to threaten an escalation of the attacks onIsraeli forces that have claimed 546 Arab lives since December.   ``This is the only answer to intransigence,'' Abdul-Rahman said.   Even so, the State Department is banking on Palestiniansaccepting the election plan partly out of a desire to gaininternational acclaim _ a move that would be especially dramatic inlight of Shamir's hard-line conditions.   That would require a turnabout by the PLO.   Six months of semi-recognition by the United States have notproduced such concessions from Yasser Arafat's organization. Havingdeclared his acceptance of Israel's right to exist and repudiatingterrorism, the chairman evidently concluded that was as far as hewas prepared to go.   Where does this leave the Bush administration?   Apparently in the same tough spot its predecessors occupied,trying to find a formula for negotiations in the face of stiffresistance in the Middle East.   And yet, Carter's experience at Camp David and theEgyptian-Israeli peace treaty are evidence that long odds can beovercome.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Schweid has covered U.S. diplomacy in theMiddle East since 1973.</TEXT></DOC>
