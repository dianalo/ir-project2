The 564-page bill was approved on a 91-8 vote two months afterPresident Bush called for emergency legislation to stop thehemorrhaging of the federal Sandamp;L insurance fund from the failure of500 thrifts, more than 200 of them in 1988, and another 350 at ornear insolvency.   The legislation reprsents the biggest government financialrescue in history, dwarfing five times over the combined costs ofthe New York City, Penn Central, Chrysler and Lockheed bailouts ofthe 1970s and early 1980s.   The administration praised the Senate's action, particularlyafter it rejected an alternative financing scheme to put theimmediate $50 billion taxpayer share of the bailout on this year'sbudget and create the potential for the biggest federal deficit inthe nation's history.   ``The Senate deserves a great deal of credit for actingswiftly,'' said Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. ``In fending offamendments to the financing mechanism, the Senate has upheld theintegrity of the Gramm-Rudman (deficit reduction) process. We alsoapplaud the Senate's efforts to maintain strong capitalrequirements.''   The Bush plan avoids swelling the budget deficit by creating anew quasi-government corporation to issue $50 billion in 30-yearbonds. The savings and loan industry will pay off the principle onthe bonds but tax dollars will be used to pay virtually all of the$4 billion to $6 billion annual interest costs.   Democrats had contended those interest costs could be reduced$150 million a year or by a total of $4.5 billion over the 30-yearlife of the bonds through direct borrowing by the Treasury.   Similar Sandamp;L legislation is moving through the House but at aslower pace. Final congressional action is expected before July.   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, had threatened to delay passageand force the Senate to cut short its 11-day recess for Passover ifit did not adopt a tougher capital standard and mandate that banksand Sandamp;Ls provide a series of free and low-cost consumer services.   After lengthy negotiations, members of the Senate BankingCommittee agreed to make Sandamp;Ls have at least 1.5 percent so-called``tangible'' capital in relation to their total loans that could beseized in the future before federal insurance funds are tapped topay off depositors in failed thrifts.   Bush's proposal would have required Sandamp;Ls to double theircapital-loan ratio from the currently required 3 percent to 6percent by 1991. But it would have allowed thrifts to meet the newrequirements entirely through the use of an accounting techniquethat allows non-money ``good will'' as capital.   The new 1.5 percent requirement for ``tangible'' capital _ cash,stocks and property that could easily be converted to cash _ alsowas adopted by the House Banking Committee's financial institutionssubcommittee last week.   But the House panel weakened other capital requirements inBush's proposal, according to consumer group critics.   The Senate Banking Committee's chairman, Sen. Donald Riegle,D-Mich., promised Metzenbaum speedy hearings and efforts to writebills to address changes in banking laws sought largely by consumergroups.   Among them are measures that would require banks and Sandamp;Ls tocash all government checks, provide low-income people with low-costchecking and publish data on their lending for improving low-incomeneigborhoods and loans to minorities.   ``It isn't all that I would like in the bill, but we've come toan understanding,'' Metzenbaum said just before the vote.   The bill tracks the proposal presented in February by Bush,pledging $157 billion over the next 10 years _ two-thirds of itfrom taxpayers _ to cover depositors against losses and calling forwidescale reforms.   Chief among them was that Sandamp;L owners be required to effectivelydouble their own investment to remain in business. Because manyoperators of failed Sandamp;Ls had little of their own money at risk,they had little incentive to refrain from making risky loans usingfederally insured deposits, according to Bush.   The package includes money to pay for some $38 billion committedlast year to close or subsidize the mergers of more than 200 Sandamp;Ls,$50 billion to be spent over the next three years for rescuing 350more institutions and $33 billion to handle new insolvenciesexpected to arise before the year 2000.   To fulfill Bush's promise of ``never again,'' the legislationalso effectively replaces the agency that oversees federallyinsured thrift institutions, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,which has been widely criticized as being too close to theindustry, with a new regulatory authority to be established underthe Treasury Department.   The Sandamp;L deposit insurance program would be transferred to theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp., which now guarantees bankdeposits. Both programs guarantee depositors against losses up to$100,000 each.   And the legislation establishes a new agency, the ResolutionTrust Corp., to dispose of some $400 billion in real estate andother property that is falling into the government's hands throughdefaults on bad loans made by failed Sandamp;Ls.   The package also increases from $10,000 a day to $1 million aday the possible fines for Sandamp;L operators convicted of fraud, whichhas been cited by government auditors as the single biggestcontributor to the crisis, and provides $50 million to the JusticeDepartment to pursue criminal charges.   Earlier Wednesday, the Senate rejected on a 61-38 vote an effortaimed at the bank board's chairman, M. Danny Wall, who has beenwidely criticized as minimizing the escalation of Sandamp;L problems lastyear.   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., complained that Wall's reassuringcomments, as late as one month before the presidential election inNovember, amounted to ``an intravenous shot of morphine that wouldhave numbed anyone to the crisis.''   Wall was an aide to Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the bankingcommittee's ranking Republican and former chairman, for 17 yearsbefore assuming the top Sandamp;L regulatory post in July 1987.   The administration and Garn want to guarantee Wall the right toserve out his term through June 1991. Graham would have requiredBush to reappoint him, forcing a likely confirmation fight with theSenate.   On passage of the bill by the Senate, all the no votes were castby Democrats: Sens. Max Baucus of Montana, Bill Bradley of NewJersey, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, James Exon of Nebraska, ErnestF. Hollings of South Carolina, Robert Kerrey of Nebraska,Metzenbaum, and David Pryor of Arkansas. Sen. Albert Gore Jr.,D-Tenn., did not vote.</TEXT></DOC>
