The confidential data, first reported in the New York Times yesterday, indicate that the Big Board's specialists failed to boost their capital to keep pace with the growth of trading during the bull market of the 1980s. The data also show that the Big Board's specialist firms were highly profitable even last year, amid the biggest stock market crash since 1929.    In 1987, according to the stock exchange's reports, the 54 specialist firms had a pretax return on equity of 38%. In 1986, the data indicate, their pretax return was 39%.    Richard Grasso, a New York Stock exchange executive vice president who becomes the exchange's president today, disputed those figures, saying they overstate specialists' profitability and take it out of context. After adjusting for expenses and subtracting out profits from other lines of business such as arbitrage and trading in other stocks, he said, the firms had pretax returns on equity of 27.6% in each of those two years.    Specialists earned a total of $369.3 million before taxes in 1987, according to the documents, despite a loss of $88.3 million in the fourth quarter, which included the October market crash. Total equity ownership, or net worth of the specialist firms, fell by $145 million in the fourth quarter to $923.1 million.    The exchange's specialist firms make markets in their assigned stocks. In order to maintain orderly markets, specialists normally buy stock when there are too few buyers and sell stock when there aren't enough sellers.    Mr. Grasso also said those figures shouldn't be compared with rates of return in most businesses. &quot;The specialist is turning his capital at an enormous velocity -- once every 1.1 days,&quot; he said. &quot;There's no comparability to, say, an industrial company.&quot;    Others had a somewhat different reaction. Securities and Exchange Commission member Charles Cox, an economist, said, &quot;That's the kind of numbers that make you sit up and take notice. I'm not saying there's anything wrong, but it does make you kind of sit up and say: Wow, I'd like to be a specialist.&quot; But, he added, &quot;I'd like to take a look at how the numbers are calculated before reaching any conclusions or making any policy judgments.&quot;    An academic expert on the markets who has reviewed the data, and who is generally hostile to the specialist system, argued that the specialists' failure to add to their capital in proportion with trading has damaged their ability to make an orderly market.    Agriculture Committee aides said the release of the data wasn't planned. Nonetheless, the move tends to serve the interests of the committee, which oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and since the crash has been seen as an ally of the Chicago futures markets against New York.    Disclosure of the information aids the Chicago markets in their effort to shift the focus of the debate over post-crash market changes toward the structure of the stock exchanges and away from the impact that futures trading has on stocks.    In February, SEC Chairman David Ruder asked Congress to give his agency jurisdiction over stock-related futures trading, which would reduce the authority of the Agriculture Committee.    The data on the specialists' financial positions tends to support the argument made at a hearing earlier this year by Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), that &quot;the specialists' capital eroded significantly as a percentage of daily value&quot; of trading in recent years.    When asked at the hearing by Sen. Leahy whether that would &quot;impede the ability of the specialists to lean against a downward trend,&quot; Mr. Ruder said it would, but noted that in recent years, an &quot;informal system&quot; developed under which specialists on the floor of the exchange were backstopped by the capital of the major Wall Street brokerages. </TEXT></DOC>
