Inland also said it plans to buy back as many as one million of its 33.5 million common shares outstanding to satisfy obligations under existing employee benefit and stock option plans.    The steel producer and operator of materials service centers said the redemption price for the 1.5 million Series B preferred will be $52.85 a share, plus 39.58 cents a share in accrued and unpaid dividends to Dec. 1. Each share of the preferred can be converted into 1.33 shares of Inland common before the redemption date.    Inland said its Series B preferred has become a relatively costly source of funds as such dividends aren't a tax-deductible expense. The company said its net operating loss carry-forward for tax purposes is expected to be exhausted shortly.    Inland's common closed yesterday at $39.75, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
