The recession weakened demand for commodities, causingprices to decline. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of21 futures prices sank to 204.68 Aug. 20, the lowest levelsince February 1987. The index ended 1991 at 208.08, down6.5% from a year before. Hardest hit were commodities used byindustry, such as copper, silver, platinum, and oil.</LP><TEXT>   But most of the drama last year was provided by the formerSoviet Union, where fast-changing events sent commodityprices swinging widely. Russia, the largest republic in thenew commonwealth, is a major producer of commodities, and thewhole commonwealth will continue to be a major buyer. Theupheaval affected markets as diverse as oil, gold and basemetals, grains, cotton, and sugar.   The Gulf War jolted commodity markets early in 1991-goldand oil prices plunged when Operation Desert Storm began.During the brief war, commodity prices declined but reboundedas the war's outcome became clear, raising hopes for an earlyrecovery from the recession. But the rally lasted only aslong as the victory euphoria and by midyear prices hadresumed their decline.   Energy                                                                                                          Going into 1992, many oil economists and analysts arebeginning to review -- and, in some cases, reduce -- earlierprojections on oil prices. But generally the outlook still isfor some firming of prices during the winter, a seasonalweakening in the second quarter, and then a fairly strongsecond half.   The expected result would be a 1992 average in crudeprices equal to, or perhaps exceeding, the 1991 average levelof just under $22 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate, orWTI, the U.S. benchmark crude. &quot;Basically, we look for a flatoil market with the first half the most problematical,&quot; sumsup Michael Rothman, a senior energy futures analyst in NewYork for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. He suggests a 1992 price rangefor WTI of $19 to $25 a barrel.   William Edwards, a Houston energy pricing specialist, isamong those still bullish on the price outlook for the earlymonths of the new year. &quot;If we have a normal winter, we willsee WTI in a $20-$24 range,&quot; he says, &quot;but, if there is asevere winter, we will see it at $25 to $30.&quot;   However, many oil analysts are beginning to hedge bycutting their price estimates in the wake of the surprisingbearish bias in oil markets since early November. Whileactual circumstances haven't changed much recently,perceptions have. As a result, the pricing correctionexpected in the spring may have come early, some suggest.   In any event, oil prices -- previously expected to remainfairly firm through the winter -- fell $4 to $5 a barrel,with WTI dropping from near $24 a few weeks ago to less than$19. It ended 1991 at $19.12 a barrel, and some suggestfurther sharp declines are likely this year. &quot;Petroleumproduct prices will continue soft while crude prices willfluctuate over the year in the range of $12 to $25 a barrel,&quot;says Norman Higby, a Menlo Park, Calif., energy forecaster.   Before the new bearish wave swept through oil markets, itwas generally believed that sluggish world oil demand wouldrise steadily through 1992, pushing prices higher. It wasassumed the economy of the U.S., the world's biggest oiluser, was rebounding from recession. Also factored in were acold winter and further rapid declines in oil exports fromthe former Soviet Union.   Demand did begin reviving some in the just completedfourth quarter and still is expected to rise further in 1992.But the International Energy Agency and others are revisingearlier forecasts to trim the size of the expected 1992demand increases, mainly because of the slowness in economicrecovery in the industrial nations. Meanwhile, the winter hasbeen relatively mild so far. Also, despite the political andeconomic turmoil there, Soviet oil exports have held steady.As a result, European and U.S. inventories of gas oil andheating oil have increased to burdensome levels.   From a fundamentals perspective, according to the DowJones International Petroleum Report, continued high crude&quot;availabilities&quot; in the physical market, slow economic growthand the lack of any severe weather in either the U.S. orWestern Europe can be expected to keep downward pressure oncrude values in the near term. &quot;Looking six months ahead, weare in for a period of sustained weakness,&quot; agrees PeterGignoux, the director of Shearson Lehman Brothersinternational energy desk in London.   Among the other uncertainties in the oil markets are theoutput levels of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries, now near capacity, and the issues related to theAugust 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. Except for Iraq,whose oil exports remain embargoed by the United Nations,OPEC has been producing flat out at more than 24 millionbarrels a day, the highest level since before the PersianGulf crisis began. Kuwait's output is recovering faster thanhad been expected after being closed by the Iraqi invasionand is now expected to reach the emirate's old OPEC quota of1.5 million barrels a day, perhaps as soon as the end of1992.   Iraq now claims it could quickly export as many as 1.5million barrels a day if allowed by the U.N. So far, Iraq hasrejected the restrictive terms of the U.N.'s proposedemergency sale of Iraqi oil. But Iraqi and U.N.representatives will meet in Vienna in early January to talkabout it, and some oil market participants look for Iraqi oilto begin pouring into world oil markets soon.   These factors contributed to the recent oil-pricedeclines, which included a drop in the average of the OPECbasket of seven crudes from close to $21 in early November --the base price targeted by many of the oil exporters -- tonearly $17 a barrel in late December. That, in turn, spurredsome oil ministers to call for an emergency OPEC conference,ahead of the scheduled Feb. 12 meeting, to set new outputcurbs to prop up prices.   Also, the price decline has led to a dilemma foroil-market participants. &quot;We are looking at a market that isfundamentally adequately supplied, but there is no sparecapacity,&quot; says Paul Mlotok, an oil economist with MorganStanley andamp; Co. in New York. &quot;If anything goes wrong insupplies,&quot; he adds, &quot;there will be a big spike upward inprices. But in the second quarter, when demand drops, OPECwill have to hold two million barrels a day off the market.&quot;                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          Very tight stockpiles of wheat and corn are setting thestage for what could be the most volatile year in the tradingpits since the U.S. drought in 1988.   The impact on prices from routine speculation about badgrowing weather or export deals will be amplified becausethere is little cushion in supplies. The U.S. wheat stockpileby June 1 is expected to be half of the June 1991 level. U.S.corn stockpiles have shrunk about 70% since the drought.   So far, however, odds favor a large corn harvest thisyear. Moisture conditions are good throughout much of theMidwest and farmers are expected to plant 2% to 4% more acresthis spring. Based on average yields, the fall corn harvestcould range as high as 8.5 billion bushels, up roughly onebillion bushels from the 1991 harvest.   The outlook for U.S. crop exports remains lackluster. Theformer Soviet Union is a major buyer but its purchases dependon credit guarantees from the Agriculture Department. Armedwith surplus wheat stockpiles, Europe and Canada are expectedto be tough competitors again this year.   The range that grain prices might trade within this yearis unusually wide. Richard A. Loewy, president of AgResourceCo., Chicago, says the price of a bushel of U.S. wheat couldpossibly be as low as $3 and as high as $5. Some analysts arepredicting that a bushel of corn could range from $1.80 to$3.50.   Soybean prices figure to be the steadiest of the majorcrops this year. U.S. stockpiles are adequate in the wake ofa larger-than-expected U.S. harvest.                                                                                                          Precious Metals                                                                                                          Gold, silver and platinum all ended 1991 substantiallylower than a year earlier: Gold declined 10.2%; silver 7.4%;and platinum 17.1%.   The recession was partly to blame for damping industrialdemand. And, with inflation under control, there was noreason for investors to buy precious metals as a hedgeagainst inflation.   Gold and platinum were also hurt by the former SovietUnion's troubles. Gold prices fell to the lowest level infive years on fears the republics, desperate for cash, wouldsell massive quantities from reserves. Also, when it becameclear the Soviet Union's inability to service its debt wasgrowing, traders worried that the country would default on&quot;swap&quot; credit arrangements, forcing banks to sell millions ofounces of gold held as collateral. Platinum came underpressure for similar reasons.   Some of those fears were allayed when the leadingindustrial nations agreed to a debt-relief package for thecountry, which took some pressure off its immediate need forcash. And revelations by a Soviet official that the country'sgold reserves are a fraction of what had been thought has ledtraders to believe the Soviet Union, or its successorconfederacy, might not have any more gold left to dump in theworld market. So, the reformed republics are likely to haveless impact on the markets this year.   Last year was also a time of soulsearching for goldinvestors who began to doubt the metal's traditional role asa haven investment. Two major world events -- the Gulf Warand the Soviet coup attempt -- presented prime opportunitiesfor gold to attract money from investors who worried aboutthe safety of paper assets during times of chaos. Butinvestors ignored gold, leaving traders to wonder whethergold these days is anything more than raw material forjewelers.   Not even the Federal Reserve's big interest rate cut justbefore Christmas could breathe life into the precious metals.As the stock market soared to records in response to the Fedaction, gold, silver, and platinum prices remained in thedoldrums.   As long as the stock market continues to do well, goldwill do poorly, says James Kneafsey, president of CambridgeFinancial Management, a Cambridge, Mass., institutionalinvestment firm. That's partly because the frenzy in stockshas drawn investment interest away from relatively weakperformers such as the precious metals, he says.   Gold, silver, and platinum will need a much strongereconomy to revive industrial demand, Mr. Kneafsey says. Goldjewelry demand and industrial uses of silver and platinum aresensitive to the economy.   And, at least for gold, inflation needs to rise to exciteinvestors, he says. If the annual increase in the consumerprice index rises above 4.5% to 5%, interest in gold may perkup, he says.   Higher inflation and a stronger economy are both possibleas the election approaches, he adds, as politicians scrambleto rev up the economy.                                                                                                          Livestock and Meats                                                                                                          An expanding cattle herd is likely to weaken prices, afteran overall price decline of about 10 cents a pound in 1991.   Cattle supplies rose last year, as ranchers throughout theU.S. expanded their herds roughly 2%. In addition, lastyear's tepid prices prompted many feedlot operators to holdcattle back and fatten them to unusually heavy weights, about1,163 pounds for the average head compared with 1,126 poundsin 1990.   As a result, analysts say, a backlog of beef could swampprices on the cash and futures markets in early 1992.   After that, the fate of beef prices rests largely on thehealth of the national economy. Consumer demand for beef, themost expensive meat, has plunged as shoppers worried aboutthe economy spurn steaks and roasts for less expensiveproducts. It will take renewed demand to pull beef prices outof their doldrums, says Dan Vaught, livestock analyst forA.G. Edwards andamp; Sons, St. Louis.   Hog farmers, meanwhile, are likely to increase porkproduction to the highest levels since 1980, when a record 91million hogs were slaughtered. Though demand for relativelycheap pork products isn't as weak as for beef, analystsexpect the surge in pork supplies to push the cash market forhogs as low as 35 cents a pound in the spring. After that,prices can be expected to rally a bit, but probably not above50 cents a pound.   There are hopes that the restructured Soviet Union willbuy large quantities of U.S.-subsidized pork bellies andother fatty pork cuts this year. Such purchases could help tobalance the negative price effects of increased porkproduction.                                                                                                          Copper                                                                                                          The red metal fared better than it should have last year,considering the economy was weak and the prices of other basemetals were depressed. But copper prices were held aloft bysqueezes in the London Metal Exchange that traders say wereengineered by Yasuo Hamanaka, Sumitomo Corp.'s chief trader.Mr. Hamanaka has said his trading is not speculative but isdirectly related to meeting customers' copper needs.   Last month, the London Metal Exchange stepped in withtrading limits that averted a potential squeeze and pricestumbled below $1 a pound. For the year, copper ended 18.3%lower.   Copper's fundamental outlook isn't encouraging. Demand hasbeen dismal in North America and Asia, says William O'Neill,senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch, and will probablycontinue to be sluggish into the first quarter and perhapsthrough the first half. Whether demand picks up later in theyear will depend on how well the economy is faring, he says.                                                                                                          Cotton                                                                                                          After a wild year, the cotton market is expected to becalmer this year.   Prospects of shortages and planting delays caused byweather problems sent prices in May to their highest levelsince 1980. But as the dust settled across the Cotton Belt,traders realized just how much cotton had been planted-thelargest crop since the 1930s and the second largest in U.S.history. As estimates of the crop size rose during the year,prices fell. From the highs of the year to the lows, pricesdropped almost 40%. Cotton ended the year down 24%.   Prices were also dragged lower by competition from foreigngrowers, particularly the Soviet Union. The reformedrepublics probably will continue to aggressively sell theirgrowths, says Sharon Johnson, cotton specialist at CargillInvestor Services in Atlanta. Demand will remain static untilthe U.S. economy picks up, she predicts.                                                                                                          Sugar                                                                                                          Weak demand, in part because the Soviet Union wasn'ttaking its usual amount, hurt prices last year and maycontinue to this year.   Cuba's crop is expected to be smaller because of machineryand fuel problems. But much of what it does produce will addto world supplies because of the problems of its biggestcustomer, the former Soviet Union.   Harri Schwartz, analyst at Cargill Investor Services,thinks the Soviet republics will iron out their difficultiesand return to the market. And Cuba's harvesting and shipmentproblems may turn out to be worse than expected, reducing itscrop even further, he says. In addition, current low pricesare likely to attract buyers seeking to rebuild stocks, hesays. All this adds up to higher prices of 12 cents to 14cents a pound, he predicts.                                                                                                          Coffee                                                                                                          Producer countries tried vainly last year to find a way toboost low coffee prices through various schemes. Brazilstarted the ball rolling by temporarily halting export salesin March, explaining it was considering a return to aninternational quota system. The move sent prices briefly to$1 a pound. Separate attempts led by Colombia to develop anagreement among producers to withhold a percentage of coffeeexports lifted prices during the late summer and again inDecember.   But neither a quota system nor retention plan emerged fromthe International Coffee Organization meetings in Septemberor December. And although producers continue to talk,analysts are skeptical any solutions will be found this year.Coffee ended the year 12.4% lower.   Where politics failed, nature may succeed in pushingcoffee prices higher. Unusually dry weather in Braziltriggered speculation that the crop will be smaller thanexpected and helped to support prices late last year. Pricesthis year will hinge on the size on the Brazilian crop, saysJudith Ganes, senior analyst at Merrill Lynch. If the cropcomes in at the higher end of current estimates, prices couldslip. But a crop at the lower end of the range could pushprices up toward $1 a pound again, she predicts.                                                                                                          Cocoa                                                                                                          For the first time in eight years, demand is expected tobe greater than production. This result should supportprices, but upside potential will be limited by the lingeringpresence of large world stocks, says Ms. Ganes of MerrillLynch. She predicts prices would trade at $1,200 to $1,550 aton this year.   But Mr. Schwartz of Cargill thinks prices could rise evenhigher. Unlike other crops whose planted acres are adjustedeach year according to prices, cocoa trees don't allow forthat type of flexibility and it will take years to increasethe crop, Mr. Schwartz explains. He expects prices will riseto $1,400 to $1,600 a ton. If traders build expectations forseveral years of deficit into the price, cocoa could riseperhaps as high as $1,900 to $2,000.                                                                                                          Orange Juice                                                                                                          A fairly quiet year was suddenly jolted to life after anOctober estimate of the Florida orange crop by the governmentfell far short of industry expectations. Prices soared fromthe range of $1.20 a pound to about $1.70 over the ensuingweeks.   Prices could go even higher early this year if a freezedevelops in the next few weeks in Florida and reduces thealready small crop. But if one doesn't come along,disappointed speculators will probably send prices down to$1.55 a pound, perhaps even $1.35 by the end of this month,predicts Celeste Georgakis, senior analyst at CargillInvestor Services.   Another big unknown is the size and timing of theBrazilian crop. Dry weather this past autumn might havereduced the crop size, and will probably delay the harvest byone to two months, Ms. Georgakis says.</TEXT></DOC>
