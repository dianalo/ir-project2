Keeps Steaming Ahead Amid Political Turmoil</HEAD><BYLINE>By SUSAN MOFFAT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Despite political turmoil, Japan Inc. is going fullsteam ahead.   The governing party this week installed its third prime ministerin three months after its worst election defeat in decades, butJapan's economy is booming and corporate profits are reaching newhighs.   Japanese business leaders, who are pouring more investment intofactories at home and abroad, welcomed the new prime minister,Toshiki Kaifu, as they did the last one just 69 days earlier.   ``We hope he will carry out the political reforms which peopleare expecting,'' said steel magnate Eishiro Saito, head of Japan'sbiggest association of industrialists.   Local media for months have criticized the sex and moneyscandals of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party as politicsunworthy of a great economic power.   But some observers say the contrast between Japan's lean, meanprivate enterprises and its swampy politics shows that the countrycan run itself well despite a vacuum in political leadership.   ``The impact of recent political problems on the economy hasbeen quite small,'' said Hiroshi Uchida, senior analyst at FirstBoston (Japan) Ltd. ``In this country, economic fundamentals aremuch more important than who becomes prime minister.''   In an editorial today, the Japan Times dismissed the LDP'srecent internal turmoil as ``a sort of tempest in a teacup or apolitical burlesque.''   For more than three decades the conservative Liberal DemocraticParty has been the faithful partner of the bureaucracy and of bigbusiness in creating Japan's famed economic growth and social andpolitical stability.   The bureaucracy gave the system brains, business provided thebrawn and the LDP contributed consensus-building and politicallegitimacy.   An influence-peddling scandal growing out of those close tieshas seriously damaged the LDP and virtually paralyzed Parliamentfor more than a year, but the private sector is charging ahead withnew investment. Economic coordination at the bureaucratic levelproceeds largely as usual.   Analysts said that isn't surprising because in Japan careerbureaucrats, not politicians, draft most laws and develop andimplement policies.   Also, huge companies like Toyota are so rich they don't evenneed bank loans, analysts said, and have long outgrown a need torely on the government.   Many Japanese businessmen don't even seem to fear the prospectof a Socialist government, which could emerge through a coalitiongovernment after lower house elections due by next summer. Someeven said it would teach the LDP a useful lesson.   ``I don't get a sense of high anxiety'' about a Socialistgovernment, said Japanese business expert James Abegglen. ``Nothingthey put forward is particularly alarming.''   ``You have to remember the Socialist Party of Japan is to theright of many right-wing parties in other countries,'' said ChrisRussell, head of equity analysis at Jardine Fleming (Securities)Japan. ``The policies of a Socialist government wouldn't be thatdramatically different from the LDP.''   The Socialists don't advocate nationalizing industries orsweeping redistribution of income, and would have trouble movingthe entrenched bureaucracy toward radical change even if theywanted to, he said.   There are some concerns a victory by the protection-mindedSocialists could worsen trade friction with the United States, andpolitical uncertainty has dampened stock market activity for months.   But the stock market surprised analysts by jumping up, not down,after each major setback for the pro-business Liberal DemocraticParty.   When Noboru Takeshita resigned in disgrace and when a majorparliamentary defeat forced his successor Sousuke Uno to step downin rapid succession, the market shot up.   Market analysts say investors were relieved of uncertainty andreassured that business could go on as usual. When it comes to thestock market, Russell said, ``politics is a non-issue.''</TEXT></DOC>
