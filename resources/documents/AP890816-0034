Mario Cuomo, unsuccessful in abid for federal approval to tear down the Shoreham nuclear plant,still insists the new plant on Long Island will not open.   ``No matter what their intent is, they're not going to be able toopen this plant,'' Cuomo said Tuesday after a nearly one-hourmeeting with President Bush.   But Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore said the plan to teardown a completed nuclear power plant before it produces anycommercial electricity was ``an upside-down energy policy thatdefies any kind of logical description.''   Bush, according to Moore, wants the Shoreham plant ``mothballed''so it can possibly be resurrected later.   ``I don't think anything was done to change the governor's mind.I don't think anything was done to change the president's mind,''Moore told reporters outside the White House after the meeting.   Cuomo said ``the most productive part of the meeting is that the(energy) planners would get together'' sometime later to discussenergy policy. The governor also said he will continue to pursuecourt challenges to the federal government's authority to intervenein the Shoreham case.   Cuomo declined to characterize Bush's reaction to hispresentation, but said it was a positive sign that the presidentagreed to the meeting.   At issue is New York's plan to dismantle the $5.5 billionShoreham plant as part of its agreement with the Long IslandLighting Co., which would sell the plant to the state for $1. Inexchange, LILCO gets guaranteed rate increases of about 5 percentfor a decade.   Although the deal has been approved by the state and LILCOstockholders, the U.S. Department of Energy has said it will try toprevent the deal by opposing transfer of Shoreham's license.   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must approve the transfer andthe Energy Department has tried to slow that process by asking thecommission to order its own environmental review of the impact ofclosing Shoreham and using alternative energy sources. The EnergyDepartment also wants the NRC to stop LILCO from further reducingstaff at the plant.   Last week, the Energy Department joined a lawsuit that challengesthe Shoreham shutdown on environmental grounds.   Cuomo requested the meeting with Bush after White House chief ofstaff John Sununu said the plant should be mothballed _ put instorage, in effect _ for a few years until Long Island residentsrealized they needed the power the plant would provide.   Cuomo met Tuesday with Bush, Sununu, Moore and deputy chief ofstaff Andrew Card.   Cuomo, on a flight back to Albany, N.Y., told reporters that``Henson Moore is an old politician who doesn't write sentences, hewrites slogans. ... They talk in slogans, they really do. And whenthey talk in sentences, they get in trouble.''   Cuomo was referring to Moore's contention that Shoreham could beoperated by the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency buyingthe plant under the agreement. Cuomo said state law prohibits theagency from operating a nuclear power plant.   Cuomo argues that Shoreham would be unsafe to operate becauseLong Island couldn't be evacuated in case of an accident. But Mooresaid the NRC has approved an evacuation plan for Long Island andthat Cuomo simply was personally opposed to opening the plant.</TEXT></DOC>
