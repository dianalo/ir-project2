The widely watched tussle between the large thrift and theFederal Home Loan Bank Board demonstrates the anger felt bymanagers of healthy Sandamp;Ls who blame sloppy or dishonest rivals forthe present crisis in the fund that insures customers' deposits.   Great Western, the nation's third-biggest thrift, stands to lose$20 million this year because of the Bank Board ruling. That amountis the difference in the cost of coverage by the Federal Savings andamp;Loan Insurance Corp. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. _ thefund for banks.   Great Western filed suit against the government in federal courtTuesday, one day after the Bank Board rejected its proposal tomerge two subsidiaries in a deal that would, in effect, take thecompany's big California operation out of the FSLIC.   The suit calls the decision ``arbitrary and capricious'' andcontends Great Western met the legal requirements for changinginsurance funds.   ``The Bank Board's erroneous refusal to approve the applicationunjustifiably imprisons Great Western Bank within the ailing FSLICsystem,'' the company said in announcing the suit.   Bank Board spokesman Mark Adams said officials had expected thesuit, and stood by their decision.   Great Western Financial, a Beverly Hills-based Sandamp;L holdingcompany, sought to merge its California subsidiary, Great WesternBank, into another subsidiary, Great Western Bank of Bellevue,Wash. (Despite the use of bank in the names, both institutions arechartered as savings and loans.)   The Bellevue institution already has fled the FSLIC. TheCalifornia Sandamp;L is barred from such a switch by state law, but bymerging into the smaller Washington institution would be able tochange insurance funds.   Great Western Financial, with $35 billion in assets, has 280retail Sandamp;L branches in California, Washington state, Florida,Arizona and New York.   Its chairman and chief executive, James Montgomery, has beenoutspoken in his belief that healthy thrifts are being unfairlytapped to make up losses incurred by the one-third of the industrythat is in trouble.   The FSLIC is strapped by a wave of failures and federally forcedmergers among thrifts pummeled by failing real estate markets insome states and, according to some critics, by fraud andmismanagement that regulators overlooked.   FSLIC insurance, which once cost about the same as FDICinsurance for banks, has nearly doubled in price because ofsurcharges imposed to replenish the fund because of the wave offailures and mergers.   In order to preserve the insurance fund, Congress in 1987imposed a moratorium on departures from the FSLIC. But GreatWestern is among some 30 thrifts that could qualify for exemptionsto the moratorium because they stated an intent to leave the fundbefore the moratorium was approved.   Among those thrifts that have applied to leave the fund is thenation's biggest thrift-holding company, H.F. Ahmanson andamp; Co. of LosAngeles, parent of Home Savings of America.</TEXT></DOC>
