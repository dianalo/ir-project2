While the suit in itself won't force a bankruptcy-court filing, it could set off a scramble by other unsecured creditors to seek similar attachments. That could put pressure on the troubled utility to voluntarily seek bankruptcy-court protection, or lead to its creditors making an involuntary bankruptcy filing.    The suit, filed late Friday by Midlantic National Bank in federal court in Concord, N.H., in effect is an attempt by one group of unsecured creditors to get preference over other unsecured creditors.    Investors and company officials cautioned, however, that a bankruptcy-court filing is by no means certain. Some debenture holders represented by Midlantic said they strenuously objected to the trustee filing the suit and will seek to have it withdrawn.    Moreover, PS of New Hamsphire said it is making progress on a financial-restructuring plan that, if accepted by debt holders and shareholders, could relieve its financial problems and make a bankruptcy filing moot. The company's financial problems stem from its 35.6% stake in the stalled Seabrook nuclear power plant.    The utility, which noted that it has 20 days to respond to Midlantic's motion to attach property, has said that it hopes develop an acceptable restructuring in the next few weeks. &quot;We're not dragging our feet,&quot; a spokesman said.    The spokesman added that, at least until now, &quot;We have been receiving indications from other trustees that they seem willing to give us breathing room.&quot;    D. Pierre Cameron Jr., vice president and general counsel of the utility, said the company isn't currently considering filing for bankruptcy-law protection.    Still, the suit by Midlantic, the trustee for holders of $425 million of debentures on which the utility has defaulted, complicates matters considerably. The suit pushes the company &quot;closer to the edge,&quot; said Paul Parshley, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette. The danger, he added, is that the suit could set off a chain of suits. &quot;It moves the (legal) process along, and makes it more difficult to turn the process off,&quot; Mr. Parshley said.    Other debt holders now could be in a position to sue their trustees for neglecting fiduciary responsibility if those trustees take no action and debt holders represented by Midlantic end up in a stronger position as creditors. &quot;This is a grave problem,&quot; said one debenture holder represented by Midlantic who asked not to be identified. &quot;This action (filing the suit) was irresponsible.&quot;    Midlantic filed the suit despite repeated requests by a number of debenture holders it represents that it call a meeting of holders before taking any action, according to the debenture holder. Many debt holders, he noted, prefer a restructuring outside of bankruptcy proceedings because of the uncertainties a bankruptcy filing would cause. PS of New Hampshire &quot;is about to come out with another plan. Don't you think we ought to look at that plan first?&quot; he said.    A Midlantic spokesman declined to discuss the suit. The suit also seeks judgment for the unpaid principle and interest on the debentures.    Whether PS of New Hampshire will be able to come up with an acceptable financial restructuring any time soon is unclear. The company's first proposal was opposed by a large number of debt holders, and it has been trying for several months to draw up a revised plan. The company also has said that it needs an emergency rate hike of 15% to help overcome its financial problems.    Another problem, said an official close to the utility, is that the increased possibility of a bankruptcy-court filing could make it more difficult for Seabrook to start low-level nuclear testing. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considering a request to permit the testing, and opponents of the plant could use any deterioration in the company's financial condition to argue against the request.    If PS of New Hampshire is forced into bankruptcy-court protection, it would be the first major utility to do so in nearly 50 years. </TEXT></DOC>
