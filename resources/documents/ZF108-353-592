Power Strip both add an icon panel to theMacintosh interface that's very much like NeXT's application launching dock.andO;AltWDEF, Alexander Colwell's freeware Control Panel device (cdev), lets youzoom Macintosh windows down to an icon at the bottom or side of the screen,the &quot;miniaturization&quot; feature that's integral to the NeXT user interface.andM;These enhancements may not appeal to all Mac users, but they're basicallyuseful ideas that are worth a try.andP;  On the other hand, what about themutation of the Mac interface we see in programs like Abbott Systems'CanOpener or ON Technology's On Location?andP;  Their redesign of standard Macwindow elements to imitate the NeXT style doesn't deliver any addedfunctionality to the Mac and at best seems like gratuitous mimicry.andM;In fact, these deviations from interface standards can actually detract fromthe Mac's overall functionality.andP;  When a program tampers with the standardwindow definitions in the Mac Toolbox, other utilities that depend on thosedefinitions may no longer work.andM;A case in point: If you use CE Software's QuicKeys to create keysubstitutions that support the extended keyboard's Home, End, Page Up andPage Down keys, these macros are inoperable within CanOpener's and OnLocation's custom, NeXTlike windows.andP;  QuicKeys' Mousies macros seem topresume adherence to certain rules about how Mac windows are structured.andM;Am I suggesting that matters of aesthetics in program design have little orno importance compared with issues of functionality?andP;  Not at all.andP;  The visualelements of Macintosh programs are fundamental to Apple's design philosophyfor the computer.andM;However, I am suggesting that NeXT's three-dimensional, gray-scale screenelements, which look so crisp on that machine's 90-dpi display, don'tbeautify the Mac's lower-resolution, monochrome display at all.andP;  In ablack-and-white environment, shades of gray must be translated into ditheredpatterns, so the NeXT clones end up looking like they were designed inMacPaint 1.0.andP;  And for color Macs, the judicious use of hues in screenelements is far more appealing than the somber NeXT grays.andM;Clearly some software designers have been seduced by the NeXT style.andP;  Ifthat's the case, they should be developing for the NeXT computer rather thanmuddying our Mac waters, which will be churned up enough with the eventualrelease of System 7.0.andM;Of course, the Mac's graphical interface isn't necessarily the best nor theonly way.andP;  But Apple made a remarkable number of right decisions back in1984, and its conservatism in embellishing the original design has servedusers very well.andP;  To its credit, Apple has never indulged itself nor burdenedits customers with change just for the sake of change.andM;The Mac's greatest innovation hasn't been extraordinary new levels offunctionality nor a graphical user interface beyond improvement.andP;  It was, andstill is, the unity of design among Mac applications -- standards thatshouldn't be sacrificed except to achieve compelling advantages, andcertainly not just because some programmers have lost their sense offahrvergnugen with the Macintosh!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
