Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach made the pledges in an exchangeof letters this month with retired Gen. John W. Vessey, U.S.presidential envoy on the issue of accounting for 1,761 Americansstill missing 13 years after the Vietnam war ended, according to aVoice of Vietnam radio report.   Thach ``affirms Vietnam's efforts to solve before the end ofthis year 70 cases of Americans missing in action consideredpriority by the U.S. side,'' said the broadcast, monitored inBangkok.   ``He welcomes the U.S. side for joint efforts in seeking out andexcavating the remains of MIAs in August, September and Octoberthis year.''   A U.S. government statement read to reporters in Washingtonsaid: ``We have long urged Vietnam to agree to joint activities,such as field investigations, surveys and excavations, to expeditethe resolution of the POW-MIA issue.   ``The Vietnamese offer is an encouraging development ... and welook forward to greatly expanded cooperation in the coming months.The two governments have agreed to hold planning meetings in HanoiJuly 25-28 to discuss technical aspects of implementing thisoffer.''   Vessey and Thach reached an agreement in August 1987 under whichVietnam would speed the search for remains and the United Stateswould consider Vietnam's humanitarian concerns.   Washington has sent medical teams and encouraged privateAmerican agencies to help Vietnamese, including those disabled inthe war.   Last August, Vessey gave Thach a list of 70 ``discrepancycases'' the United States considers most easily resolvable becausethe Vietnamese should have information on them. Included are casesin which there are photographs of airmen taken after they werecaptured.   Vietnam has delivered many purported MIA remains since,including 27 sets April 6, the largest turnover since the war. Fewdiscrepancy cases have been resolved, however, and U.S. officialshave complained about the slow pace.   Despite pledges to do so, Vietnam has not allowed jointexcavations since the first one, a dig in late 1985 at the site ofa B-52 bomber crash near Hanoi. U.S. officials in Bangkok say theVietnamese have not given a clear explanation.   On Thursday, the radio said Thach wrote Vessey a letter July 9urging the United States to ``seriously carry out all agreementsrelating to Vietnam.''   It said a reply received Monday welcomed the joint excavations.According to the report, Vessey ``hoped that the cooperationbetween the two countries this year will be continued andexpanded'' and said the United States ``will continue trying torespond to Vietnam's humanitarian concerns.''   Thach indicated previously Vietnam wants more U.S. governmentaid, but Washington refuses to agree until Vietnam ends its9-year-old occupation of Cambodia.   The United States and Vietnam have no diplomatic ties, butrelations have improved with the recent agreements.   Diplomats said one indication was the relative speed with whichVietnam returned three U.S. Navy aviators it rescued after theirplane made an emergency landing July 12 in the South China Sea.They arrived at Subic Bay naval base in the Philippines on Tuesday.   Previously, any foreigners found in Vietnamese territorialwaters were confined for months in difficult conditions.   The same hard bargaining continued, however. Bill Schauer, aU.S. Embassy spokesman in Bangkok, said Thursday Vietnam asked theUnited States to pay all costs incurred in the rescue,transportation and lodging of the aviators.   ``This request is under review,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
