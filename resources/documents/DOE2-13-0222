Said agent has the formula R-S/sub(n)/-R/sup1/ where n is a whole number from 3 to 20 and where the radicals R/sup1/,identical or different, each represent an organic radical including 1-150carbon atoms per molecule, these radicals being chosen in the group consistingof the alkyl radicals, saturated or unsaturated, linear or branching,or of the naphthenic type, the aryl radicals, the alkylaryl radicalsand the arylalkyl radicals, R/sup 1/ also being able to represent thehydrogen atom. This method has the advantage of limiting in importantfashion the industrial infrastructures which reclaim the presulfurationtechniques of the prior art.</TEXT></DOC>
