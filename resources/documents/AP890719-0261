(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   United Mine Workers and Pittston Co.officials began federally mediated contract talks today, the firstnegotiations in the bitter coal strike in six weeks.   Outside the closed-door sessions, negotiators blamed each otherfor the long stalemate, which has led to wildcat sympathy strikes atother companies that idled as many as 46,000 miners at various times.   Pittston Coal Group President Michael Odom said it is up to theunion to get talks moving by responding to the company's latestcontract offer.   ``We have our proposal on the table,'' Odom said on today's ``CBSThis Morning'' news show. ``We feel our proposal recognized thedynamics of the coal market we operate in ... we feel our proposalwould put people back to work.''   Before entering the talks, UMW President Richard Trumkaresponded: ``I think it was a mistake for Mr. Odom to go on TV thismorning and say how inflexible he is.''   The parties spent four hours with a judge Tuesday before agreeingto resume negotiations. Talks had broken down June 8.   At today's talks, the two sides sat in separate rooms withfederal mediators shuttling messages between them. The 3{-month-oldstrike has been marked by occasional violence and triggered wildcatwalkouts by tens of thousands of miners.   UMW President Richard Trumka, speaking to reporters at asouthwest Virginia motel where the talks began, said the way tosolve the strike would be for Pittston Chairman Paul Douglas toparticipate in the negotiations.   ``I'm disappointed that's not going to happen,'' Trumka said.   But Michael Odom, president of Pittston's mining subsidiary,Pittston Coal Group Inc., told reporters the company wouldn't bepressured into changing its negotiators.   ``It would be improper for the union to dictate to us or for usto dictate to the union who represents them at the bargainingtable,'' Odom said.   About 1,900 UMW miners are striking Pittston for its refusal tosign a national contract guaranteeing full medical benefits forpensioners and prohibiting mandatory overtime and Sunday work.   Pittston miners went on strike in Virginia and West Virginia inearly April after working 14 months without a contract. Workers inKentucky walked out in June. Hundreds of miners have been arrestedfor a variety of violent incidents and for civil disobediencetactics, such as blocking coal-hauling roads.   Wildcat strikes in support of the Pittston workers began lastmonth and idled up to 46,000 miners in 10 states.   Most of those miners returned to work this week, but wildcatstrikes continued in parts of West Virginia. Shots were firedTuesday at coal trucks in Boone County, W.Va. No injuries werereported and state police Superintendent J.R. Buckalew said the coalfields were relatively quiet.   Union officials in Alabama told more than 3,000 miners to returnfor Tuesday night's shift at two companies after they failed to showup earlier in the day.   Trumka said the company wants to stop financing pensions for6,000 Pittston retirees, a move he claimed would lead othercompanies to seek to eliminate funds for 130,000 pensioners, widowsand dependents.   Pittston also refuses to allow 4,000 laid-off employees toreclaim jobs when they become available, Trumka said.   ``Do we see it as a frontal assault on the union? Yes, we do,''he said.   Odom reiterated the company's contention that it needs contractchanges so it can meet competition from other producers, includingforeign companies.   ``They're just going to have to recognize changes in the dynamicsof the coal industry,'' Odom said.   The two sides met Tuesday with U.S. District Judge Glen Williams,who has been presiding over contempt charges against the unionstemming from its picket line activity at Pittston operations.   Williams said he was encouraged by the presence at the meeting ofTrumka, UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts, Odom and Pittston ViceChairman Joseph Farrell.   ``To see all this high brass here exceeds my expectations,''Williams said.   Trumka said he would have preferred that the union and companymeet face-to-face, but said anything is better than stalemate.   If the talks fail, Trumka said the union would seek anindependent labor expert to determine which side is refusing tobargain in good faith.   Odom said he was not willing to assume the talks would fail. ``Wefelt that federal mediation was the appropriate agency for adifferent approach,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
