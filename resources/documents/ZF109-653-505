745 pounds (network)andM;* PC USER VERDICT Lacks a few useful functions, but is still a very goodprogram development package.andP;  The Clipper compatibility is a major plus,especially if you already use dBase or Clipper.andM;PC-based 4GLs provide all types of developers -- some of whom aren't normallyeven associated with that role -- with benefits.andP;  With 4GLs, users can writesimple applications and so offload some of the workload from the DPdepartment.andP;  Expert programmers, on the other hand, use 4GLs to generate codefor standard functions (data entry screens, for example), which is at besttedious to perform manually.andP;  This code can then be combined with manuallywritten code to produce the desired result.andM;In one organisation I know of, this process has been taken one step further:all data entry screens and reports are designed by the users, and the dPdepartment then adds all the processing code to produce the finishedapplication.andP;  This system allows both groups just the right amount ofcontrol.andM;Several products compete for attention in this sector, and we looked at thelatest releases of two of the market leaders -- Clarion and Sycero dB.andM;There's one major similarity between the two packages: both produceexecutable (.EXE) files, which means that developers are free to distributefinished applications ad infinitum, without paying any royalties and withoutneeding a run-time version of the 4GL.andM;That apart, the two packages perform the tasks of a 4GL in very differentways.andP;  This may well stem from the fact that Sycero dB -- as its name implies-- generates dBase (Clipper version) compatible code and files.andP;  Thus itsdesign is influenced by dBase code and file structures.andM;I've used previous versions of both packages, so I wanted to regenerate andcompile an existing application and then enhance it.andP;  I then put myself inthe position of a first-time user and developed new applications from scratchwith both packages.andM;As an existing user, I was immediately disappointed by the documentation ofboth products.andP;  I'd have thought that a chapter devoted to the regenerationof existing applications was essential -- but where was it?andP;  In Sycero inparticular, some commands have changed and function libraries have beenreplaced.andM;In Clarion's case, the changes didn't seem to affect existing applications tothe same degree.andP;  In fact, the package appears to have undergone few majorchanges -- the one clear upgrade was the new Reporter utility.andP;  PC-based 4GLShave often been weak in the reporting department, and this represents a stepin the right direction.andM;Sycero dBandM;Sycero generates code which can be compiled using Clipper, the dBasecompiler.andP;  There are advantages and disadvantages to this: it's good thatyour programs will be able to read and write dBase format (.DBF) files, butyou'll need to buy Clipper in order to use Sycero (the package also used tosupport Foxbase, but this is no longer the case).andM;Sycero's screen and report formatters are powerful and easy to use.andP;  Inscreens and reports, related file lookup can be generated automatically.andP;  Youcan even set up a mailmerge facility with imaginative use of reports,providing you use a file with at least one memo field (an example is given inthe manual).andM;Sycero lets you insert 300 lines of code before and after edit or display ofeach field; this code could be used for the likes of data validation and helpmessages.andP;  The code that can be entered here or elsewhere in Sycero includesa combination of dBase, Clipper and Sycero.andP;  Code can also be entered atseveral 'entry points', such as 'Before files are updated' and 'After filesare updated'.andP;  Sycero users also have the option of calling functions writtenin C or Assembler.andM;The program types supported are Maintenance, Posting, Menu, Enquiries,Reports and Free Format.andP;  Free Format allows you to type your own code; codegenerated by Sycero using this program type is only used for file handling.andM;Posting is the most interesting and unusual program type.andP;  It automates thecreation of batch posting routines, as used in accounting-type applications.andO;In effect, it's an array maintenance program generator which lets you add,amend and delete array elements freely until the records are posted.andP;  This isa very powerful feature.andM;The native Sycero language is an excellent extension of dBase and Clipper.andO;In many instances, reams of dBase code have been replaced by about 10 linesof Sycero.andP;  The commands and functions have been well thought out and areideally suited to developing applications for business use.andM;Now for its major weaknesses.andP;  First, there's no Help maker.andP;  A 4GL shouldautomate these things: no well designed and written application would bewithout context-sensitive help screens today; since they're so useful, Syceroought to provide an easy means of creating them.andM;My second grouse concerns the File Maintenance programs generated by Sycero.andO;These all permit users to create, amend and delete records.andP;  In manycircumstances you might not want to allow the deletion of a record.andP;  Havingthe menu option available but not permitting actual deletion is the obvioussolution, but it isn't a very elegant one -- there should be a means oftelling Sycero which file handling routines you want to generate.andP;  Third,there isn't a way to maintain data files without running the finisheapplication.andM;Finally, to test a Sycero application you have to go through the completegeneration, compilation and linking process.andP;  This is extremelytime-consuming, even on the 25MHz 386 machine I use.andP;  You can link theClipper debugger, but even then the whole process has to be repeated beforechanges can be tested.andM;ClarionandM;I found Clarion to be the more complete programming environment; in additionto the screen and report formatters and the automatic code generators, therewere many features worthy of mention.andM;The designer pulls the whole process together, and it's possible to gain anoverview of the program development at any time through a hierarchy ofworksheets.andP;  Indeed, using the designer you could create a completeapplication which would include any Clarion code you wanted to add.andM;For those who want to develop simple applications or generate prototypesquickly, there's a feature called Quick Start.andP;  This options is offeredwhenever an application is being created, and all you need to do is definethe file structure.andP;  Clarion generates all the file maintenance routines, aswell as lookup and report routines, using the keys defined to drive them.andM;Using the designer you can link help windows to fields or procedures as youcreate an application.andP;  Creating an actual help window is easy using thehelper utility, which works in a similar fashion to the screeen and reportformatters.andM;You can create or amend Clarion code directly using the editor.andP;  Here there'sa useful shortcut -- pressing Ctrl-F calls up the screen and reportformatters, and the code for the screen or report you paint is generated andinserted at that point.andM;The reporter enables you to create quite sophisticated reports; it's separatefrom the report formatter, which creates reports that are part of thefinished application.andM;Other utilities for creating, amending and looking at files are the filer,the scanner and the sorter.andP;  The converter enables conversion of files to andfrom a variety of other formats including ASCII and dBase.andP;  Files can begiven password protection and/or encrypted.andM;Crossrefer generates a cross-reference listing of all variables used by yourapplication and in invaluable in the debugging and maintenance of complexapplications.andM;Finally there are the compiler, the processor and the translator.andP;  Thecompiler compiles the Clarion code into object code which can then be runusing the processor.andP;  This provides a quick means of testing yourapplication.andP;  The translator then creates an executable file.andM;Overall, I preferred Clarion as an environment for serious programdevelopment.andP;  My only major criticism is that the manuals are weak, althoughattractive.andM;Here's an example.andP;  The default method of calling a form (data entry screen)is to make a choice from a table, which isn't always appropriate.andP;  I wantedto call a form directly but I couldn't actually find the answer in themanual.andM;I eventually found the solution in one of the example programs.andP;  A variablecalled ACTION had to be assigned a value to indicate whether the form was tobe used to add, delete or amend a record.andP;  You'd think that such a featurewas sufficiently important to merit a mention.andM;In mitigation, there's a user group as well as technical bulletins, andunlike Sycero there's on-line context-sensitive help.andP;  The problem discussedabove was even mentioned in one such bulletin.andP;  A third-party manual is nowavailable in the US and will be here soon -- let's hope that it plugs some ofthe manuals' current gaps.andM;Problems with the manual notwithstanding, this is a program I can recommendhighly.andP;  It's as complete a development environment as you'll find anywhere,and it deserves to repeat its US success.andM;A sure sign of its increasing momentum is the availability of severallanguage extension modules (LEMs) written in C and Assembler.andM;These include graphics, communications and access to dBase and other filesfrom within Clarion applications.andP;  There's even an LEM which allows users totype dBase commands in order to access files.andM;Clarion scores very well during random access of files and doing lookups inrelated files.andP;  Sycero was usually better when performing batch updates usingthe dBase UPDATE and REPLACE commands.andP;  Furthermore, dBase code, as used bySycero, permits more generic file lookup procedures.andM;It's difficult to choose between these two products.andP;  To be fair, I can'tthink of any application we've developed over the past two years that wouldpose problems for either.andP;  Which is faster will depend on the particularapplication.andM;You must judge them in the light of your own circumstances.andP;  If you currentlyuse dBase or Clipper, then Sycero may well be the package for you.andP;  If you'relooking for your first 4GL and don't want total dBase compatibility, thenClarion is worth a close look.andM;What's a 4GL?andM;In the PC environment, 4GLs are usually synonymous with ApplicationGenerators.andP;  These are products that write applications for you by generatingstandard code using a template which has been amended to reflect answersyou've already provided.andM;Each 4GL comes equipped with one or more template.andP;  The code produced maythen need to be compiled to produce a finished application.andM;The routines you'd expect from all 4GLs are File Maintenance (add, amend,delete records), Data Entry screens and Reports.andP;  Additional routinesgenerated by Sycero and Clarion include Posting and Enquiry.andM;One of the most common criticisms levelled at 4GLs is the blandness of theapplications they produce.andP;  Some people would argue that this providesconsistency.andP;  In any event, most 4GLs permit you to alter the finished code,thus producing a truly customised application.andM;On the positive side, much programming time can be saved by using 4GLswithout necessarily sacrificing the ability to tailor an application to yourstyle.andM;The other major benefit is the ability of most 4GLs to automatically generatecomprehensive documentation for the relevant application.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
