Johanna Tefo, her toes poking out of her tattered shoes,describes fleeing from her flimsy plywood shack as itdisappeared in flames; all she has left now is hertoothbrush, which is wedged behind her left ear like apencil. Selina Mqambela, still in a daze, recalls the eighthours she spent hiding in a swamp, hoping the reeds wouldconceal her from the men with spears and machetes. DuduzileMkhwanazi, betraying no emotion, tells of her frantic searchfor her husband, which ended when she saw police slinging hisbody onto a pile of corpses.</LP><TEXT>   When South African President F.W. de Klerk openedParliament in February with a series of stunning politicalreforms, including the unbanning of black opposition groupsand a commitment to end white minority rule, he declared that&quot;the season of violence is over.&quot; But in the turbulent monthssince then, it has only gotten worse, culminating in anoutburst of unrest in the past five days that has blackskilling blacks, leaving more than 270 people dead, hundredsmore injured and thousands homeless.   The reforms have unleashed a flood of emotions bottled upduring 40 years of racial segregation and severe repressionof black politics. Over the past week, black townships aroundJohannesburg have erupted with clashes between supporters ofInkatha and the African National Congress, two rival partiesseeking to build their power bases in the newly openpolitical arena. The police and army, controlled by the whitegovernment, have been accused of taking sides and in somecases of abetting the violence.   &quot;If this is what the future of South Africa will be, itwill be horrible,&quot; says the Reverend Z.T. Mohatsoa, who hasopened up St. Peter's to about fifty women and children lefthomeless by the fighting. &quot;We haven't struggled for blackliberation all these years to end up like this. Who will wantto live here?&quot;   The fighting, tragically, has dashed the optimismgenerated by the two initial meetings between the governmentand the ANC aimed at clearing away the obstacles tonegotiations on a new constitution. Earlier this month, theANC suspended its 30-year-old guerrilla struggle againstwhite rule, and the government set up a timetable for therelease of political prisoners and return of exiles. Peace,it seemed, was at hand.   But then the shacks of Katlehong -- scarred by some of thefiercest fighting -- and neighboring Thokoza, southeast ofJohannesburg, went up in flames, and so did the spirit ofnegotiation. As a result, the peace process, and thepolitical leaders brokering it, are under intense pressure.Right-wing whites opposed to the reforms last week broke up aspeech by Mr. de Klerk, who they say is plunging the countryinto anarchy. ANC leader Nelson Mandela and Inkatha chiefMangosuthu Buthelezi seem powerless to control theirsupporters. Deep-seated mistrust between the organizationshave kept the two black leaders from coming together for ajoint call for peace. While each of them meets with thegovernment, they have yet to talk to each other.   The most disturbing aspect of the violence for both blackand white South Africans, as well as for foreigners lookingto invest in the country's post-apartheid economy, is theugly overtone of tribal feuding, which has contributed to thedownfall of much of the rest of Africa. The women seekingrefuge at St. Peter's, who come from a mixture of tribes, saythe Katlehong violence started when Zulus loyal to Inkatha(which is Zulu-based) poured out of migrant labor dormitoriesand attacked the squatter community, particularly targetingXhosas. (Mr. Mandela is a Xhosa.) Then, say the women, theXhosa men would regroup and attack the Zulus. The cycle ofrevenge spun out of control, and spread to other areas aroundJohannesburg.   &quot;The picture from this is that Africans can't governthemselves, that Africans are irresponsible, that we don'tcare for life,&quot; says Faith Mashiloane, a member of theKatlehong Civic Association. &quot;But that isn't true. I tellyou, it isn't true.&quot;   The officers of the association, which is aligned withgroups supportive of the ANC, have come to St. Peter's tofigure out what went wrong. One blames it on the legacy ofapartheid, which accentuated tribal differences by trying todivide the black majority into ethnic homelands. Another saysthe impoverished living conditions of blacks breedfrustration and hostility.   Many of the civic officials blame conservative elements inthe police who, they say, are intent on destabilizing thepolitical negotiations and therefore are slow to curb theviolence. (The police vehemently deny this.) Still more blameInkatha for raising tensions in the area; one refers to apamphlet distributed by Inkatha calling on Zulus to resistbeing ruled by a Xhosa, meaning Mr. Mandela. Perhaps, anothervolunteers, Mr. Mandela should overrule ANC objections tomeeting with Mr. Buthelezi and test Inkatha's claims topeace.   The women refugees at St. Peter's are weary of sayingwho's to blame. Letitia Pekane, a social worker at the churchwho is trying to help them settle into new homes, conjures upa familiar image of South Africa. The country is like azebra, she says. If someone kills the black stripes, thewhite ones die too, and vice versa.   &quot;If one dies, all die,&quot; she says. &quot;That's what ishappening now. We are all dying.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
