<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-32-0554 </DOCNO><TEXT>The organization of work a cycle control subsystem of the SPIN model superconductingaccelerator in the mode of cryogenic synchrotron testing is presented.This subsystem is based on a MERA-60 (electronica-60) microcomputer.Hardware and software of the system based on the MERA-60 microcomputerare described. This complex provides the remote cyclic control of industrialpower supplies of the synchrotron magnet system in accordance with amplitude- time parameters given by the operator, as well as the synchronizationof accelerator units and control of its element efficiency. The methodsfor providing the reliability of multiprogram (multimode) acceleratorcycle control based on using a wide-range timer ''Time Guard'', meansfor remote control of microcomputer supply and its program restart, aswell as unique organization of program exchange operative memory of microcomputerand standard disk memory device are considered. The given methods permittedto avoid accidents on a superconducting accelerator caused by automationsystem, provide parameter registering and flexible readjusting of synchrotronmode of operation, as well as minimal operator action at subsystem start-upand its current operation. 7 refs.; 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
