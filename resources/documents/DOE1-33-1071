The researchwill determine suitable species, yields, and operating parameters. Anumber of microalgae species will be inoculated into the ponds to determinewhich species offer potential for high lipid yield. Additional data analyseswill be performed on the physical, chemical, and biological responsesof the algal species to system operational parameters. Research willalso analyze the production of protein, lipids, and carbohydrates byvarious species. Laboratory-scale support studies will be conducted asnecessary, and production system performance sensitivities will be analyzedfor the final evaluation. A previous contract with EnBio resulted inthe design, site preparation, and partial construction of an experimentalalgae culture facility. Under this original subcontract, two 200-m{sup2} outdoor ponds and one 100-m{sup 2} outdoor pond were constructed andmade operational. Studies have shown that the microalgae Ankistrodesmusand Scenedesmus will establish productive monocultures in outdoor culture.Yields of 20 g/m{sup 2}-day at 25% lipid have been achieved. A continuousculture strategy has proven more productive than a batch culture strategy.Using media recycle and reduced mixing speeds, costs of production havebeen significantly reduced.</TEXT></DOC>
