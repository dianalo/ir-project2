WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said his talksnext month with Poland's Solidarity-led government will be a``historic chance'' to mend fences with a World War II adversary.   Government spokesman Hans Klein said Kohl will offer Polandrelief for its $39 billion foreign debt during his Nov. 9-14 visit.   Kohl's office also announced Friday that the chancellor willvisit Hungary soon, although no date has been set.   West Germany has led efforts among European Community andWestern creditors to help Poland resolve its staggering economicproblems. The Bonn government has also been outspoken in itssupport of democratic reforms instituted there and in Hungary.   West Germany is Poland's biggest trading partner and its biggestcreditor, holding about 20 percent of Warsaw's foreign debt.   ``We now have the historic chance, because of the dramaticchanges and improvements in Poland, for a new beginning in ourrelations 50 years after World War II,'' Kohl told ARD television.``We owe it to the younger generations to foster goodneighborliness and friendship.''   Kohl's chief foreign affairs adviser, Horst Teltschik, andTeltschik's Polish counterpart, Mieczyslaw Pszon, last weekconcluded a package of financial and political accords that resolveoutstanding problems between the two countries, governmentofficials said.   Klein said West Germany will tie its financial assistance tospecific projects. He confirmed the two governments have discussedfrom $1 billion to $1.5 billion in aid.   West Germany announced Monday that it had agreed to reschedule$1.3 billion in Polish debt, and an earlier agreement effectivelywiped out about $523 million in loans to Poland.   Among the accords are programs to improve living conditions forethnic Germans in Poland. The language and culture of the ethnicminority have been discouraged in areas that were part of Germanyprior to World War II.   West German officials concede privately that funds forGerman-language schools and projects to increase production ofconsumer goods are aimed partly at stemming the flow of ethnicGermans from Poland. More than 140,000 ethnic Germans emigratedfrom Poland to West Germany last year, and that number has alreadybeen exceeded this year.   Resolution of the economic and political issues cleared the wayfor Kohl's trip, which initially was planned for the summer. It wascalled off because of remaining differences between the two nations.   Bonn had hoped to work out a reconciliation plan with Polandbefore the 50th anniversary of the Sept. 1, 1939 invasion of Polandby Nazi Germany, which set off World War II.   Negotiations toward the West German-Polish summit were put onhold during the spring talks between Poland's Solidarity tradeunion and the Communist Party. Those negotiations Poland's freestelections in more than four decades _which the opposition won by alandslide _ and the Soviet bloc's first Cabinet not led byCommunists.   Kohl will be the first Western leader to pay an official visitto Poland since Tadeusz Mazowiecki was named premier in August.   The talks had been frustrated by some prominent West Germanpoliticians who said German territory lost to Poland after WorldWar II should be returned. National tensions still flare over the40,000 square miles of German territory deeded to Poland after thedefeat of Nazi Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
