NEDOhas been developing techniques for this evaluation by implementing afour-year plan which started in 1984. There are four points on this development:(1) A conceptual model on which to base analysis of the entire geothermalsystem should be created; (2) Actually measured values should be comparedwith the results of simulation based on a tentative model to modify themodel so that the temperature, pressure, flow distribution, and othergethermal parameter can be determined quantitatively; (3) The permeability,which is one of geothermal reservoir parameters, can be evaluated witha high accuracy by conducting well testing; (4) A power generation planshould be worked out according to the quantitatively established model.The model field is the Kirishima area in Kyushu.
