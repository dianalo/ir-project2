General Permits and Requests for Individual NPDES Permits</ITAG>Section 301(a) of the Clean Water Act (the Act) provides that the dischargeof pollutants is unlawful except in accordance with the terms of an NPDESpermit: Under EPA's regulations (40 CFR 122.28(a)(2)), EPA may issue asingle general permit to a category of point sources located within thesame geographic area if the regulated point sources:andbullet; Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations;andbullet; Discharge the same types of wastes;andbullet; Require the same effluent limitations or operating conditions;andbullet; Require similar monitoring requirements; and andbullet; In the opinion of the Regional Administrator, are more appropriatelycontrolled under a general permit than under individual permits.In addition, under EPA regulations (40 CFR 122.28(c)(1)), the RegionalAdministrator is required to issue general permits covering dischargesfrom offshore oil and gas facilities within the Region's jurisdiction.Where the offshore area includes areas for which separate permit conditionsare required, such as areas of environmental concern, a separate individualor general permit may be required by the Regional Administrator.The Regional Administrator has determined that exploratory oil and gasfacilities operating in the area described in this general NPDES permitare more appropriately controlled by a general permit than by individualpermits. The decision of the Regional Administrator is based on an evaluationof the section 403(c) Ocean Discharge Criteria (40 CFR Part 125, SubpartM) for discharges from exploratory operations into the waters of LeaseSale 109, the Agency's recent permit decisions in other Alaskan OCS areas,and the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (Draft EIS) for OCS LeaseSale 109.Any owner and/or operator authorized to discharge under a general permitmay request to be excluded from coverage under the general permit by applyingfor an individual permit as provided by 40 CFR 122.28(b). The operatorshall submit an application together with the reasons supporting the requestto the Director, Water Division, EPA, Region 10 (``Director''). A sourcelocated within a general permit area, excluded from coverage under thegeneral permit solely because it already has an individual permit (i.e.,a permit that has not been continued under the Administrative ProcedureAct), may request that its individual permit be revoked, and that it becovered by the general permit. Upon revocation of the individual permit,the general permit shall apply. Procedures for modification, revocation,termination, and processing of NPDES permits are provided by 40 CFR 122.62-122.64.As in the case of individual permits, violation of any condition of a generalpermit constitutes a violation of the Act that is enforceable under section309 of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Covered Facilities and Nature of Discharges </ITAG>The general permit proposed today authorizes the discharge of drillingmuds, drill cuttings, and associated operational wastewaters from exploratoryoperations in federal waters. Exploratory operations are defined as thoseoperations involving the drilling of wells to determine the nature of potentialhydrocarbon reserves. Under the permit, the number of wells from whichdischarges may occur is generally limited to a maximum of five at a singlesite. Exploration facilities covered by this general permit are includedin the Offshore Subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction Point SourceCategory (40 CFR Part 435). This general permit authorizes the following discharges: Drilling mud;drill cuttings and washwater; deck drainage; sanitary wastes; domesticwastes; desalination unit wastes; blowout preventer fluid; boiler blowdown;fire control system test water; non-contact cooling water; uncontaminatedballast water; noncontaminated bilge water; excess cement slurry; mud,cuttings, and cement at the seafloor; and test fluids. Descriptions ofdischarges are given in Part II.A of the draft permit. Drilling muds and cuttings are the major pollutants sources dischargedfrom exploratory drilling operations. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Statutory Basis for Permit Conditions </ITAG>Sections 301(b), 304, 308, 401, 402, and 403 of the Act provide the basisfor the permit conditions contained in the permit. The general requirementsof these sections fall into three categories, which are described below.A discussion of the basis for specific permit conditions follows in PartIV of this fact sheet. <T3>A. Technology-Based Effluent Limitations </T3>1. <T3>BPT Effluent Limitations: </T3>The Act requires particular classesof industrial dischargers to meet effluent limitations established by EPA.EPA promulgated effluent limitations guidelines requiring Best PracticableControl Technology Currently Available (BPT) for the Offshore Subcategoryof the Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category (40 CFR Part 435, SubpartsA and D) on April 13, 1979 (44 FR 22069). BPT effluent limitations guidelines required ``no discharge of free oil''for discharges of deck drainage, drilling muds, drill cuttings, and welltreatment fluids. This limitation required that a discharge shall not causea film or sheen upon or discoloration on the surface of the water or adjoiningshorelines, or cause a sludge or emulsion to be deposited beneath the surfaceof the water or upon adjoining shorelines (40 CFR 435.11(d). The BPT effluentlimitations guideline for sanitary waste required that the concentrationof chlorine be maintained as close to 1 mg/1 as possible in dischargesfrom facilities housing ten or more persons. For facilities continuouslymanned by nine or fewer persons or only intermittently manned by any numberof persons, the BPT effluent limitations guideline for sanitary waste requiredno discharge of floating solids. A ``no floating solids'' guideline isalso applied to domestic waste. BPT limitations on oil and grease in producedwater allowed a daily maximum of 72 mg/1 and a monthly average of 48 mg/1.2. <T3>BAT and BCT Effluent Limitations: </T3>As soon as practicable but inno case later than March 31, 1989, all permits are required by section301(b)(2) of the Act to contain effluent limitations for all categoriesand classes of point sources which: (1) Control toxic pollutants (40 CFR401.15) and nonconventional pollutants through the use of Best AvailableTechnology Economically Achievable (BAT), and (2) represents Best ConventionalPollutant Control Technology (BCT). BCT effluent limitations apply to conventionalpollutants (pH, BOD, oil and grease, suspended solids, and fecal coliform).In no case may BCT or BAT be less stringent than BPT.BAT and BCT effluent limitations guidelines and New Source PerformanceStandards (NSPS) were proposed on August 26, 1985 (50 FR 34592). Promulgationof the final guidelines and standards for muds and cuttings is expectedto occur in mid-1988. In the absence of effluent limitations guidelinesfor the Offshore Subcategory, permit conditions must be established usingBest Professional Judgment (BPJ) procedures (40 CFR 122.43, 122.44, and125.3). This permit incorporates BAT and BCT effluent limitations basedon the Agency's Best Professional Judgment. Previous BPJ determinationsfor offshore oil and gas exploratory operations were incorporated intothe general permits for the Bering and Beaufort Seas (49 FR 23734, June7, 1984), Norton Sound (50 FR 23578, June 4, 1985, and Cook Inlet (51 FR35460, October 3, 1986. As required by section 304(b)(2)(B) of the Act, in developing the BPJ/BATpermit conditions, the Agency considered the age of equipment and facilitiesinvolved, the process employed, the engineering aspects of the applicationof various types of control techniques, process changes, the cost of achevingsuch effluent reduction, non-water quality environmental impact (includingenergy requirements), and such other factors as the Director deemed appropriate.The types of equipment and processes employed in exploratory drilling operationsare well known to the Agency. Region 10 has issued numerous general andindividual permits for such operations. The records for this permit andthose earlier permits thoroughly discuss the types of equipment, facilitiesand processes employed in exploratory drilling operations. With regardto the engineering aspects of the application of various types of controltechniques, there are no BAT permit limitations based on installation ofcontrol equipment. All proposed BAT permit limitations can be achievedthrough product substitution, the technology basis for the limitationsin this permit. Any costs of achieving the effluent limitations and anynon-water quality environmental impacts were also evaluated. A discussionof such evaluations is presented below with respect to any limitation whereapplicable. As required by section 304(b)(4)(B) of the Act, Region 10 considered thesame factors in determining BPJ/BCT permit conditions, but with one exception.Rather than considering ``the cost of achieving such effluent reduction,''any BCT determination includes ``consideration of the reasonableness ofthe relationship between the costs of attaining a reduction in effluentsand the effluent benefits derived, and the comparison of the cost and levelof reduction of such pollutants from publicy owned treatment works to thecost and level of reduction of such pollutants from a class or categoryof industrial sources.'' BCT effluent limitations cannot be less stringentthan BPT; therefore, if the candidate industrial technology fails the BCT``cost test'', BCT effluent limitations are set equal to BPT. Region 10's evaluation of the BAT factors, as discussed above, is alsoapplicable to BCT, as well as to the Region's best professional judgmentdeterminations of BPT in instances where there is no BPT effluent limitationguideline for a particular wastestream. Unlike the BAT permit limitations,there is one BCT limitation based on installation of control equipment.There is a 10 percent limitation on the oil content of cuttings, basedon the efficiency of conventional cuttings washers. With respect to theBCT ``cost test,'' all BCT limitations are equal to the BPT effluent limitationsguidelines or to the Region's best professional judgment determinationsof BPT. Therefore, no incremental costs will be incurred. B. Ocean Discharge Criteria Section 403 of the Act requires that an NPDES permit for a discharge intomarine waters located seaward of the inner boundary of the territorialseas be issued in accordance with guidelines for determining the degradationof the marine environment. These guidelines, referred to as the Ocean DischargeCriteria (40 CFR Part 125, Subpart M), and section 403 are intended to``prevent unreasonable degradation of the marine environment and to authorizeimposition of effluent limitations, including a prohibition of discharge,if necessary, to ensure this goal'' (45 FR 65942, October 3, 1980), If EPA determines that the discharge will cause unreasonable degradation,an NPDES permit will not be issued. If a determination of unreasonabledegradation cannot be made because of a lack of sufficient information,EPA must then determine whether a discharge will cause irreparable harmto the marine environment and whether there are reasonable alternativesto on-site disposal. To assess the probablility of irreparable harm, EPAis required to make a determination that the discharger, operating underappropriate permit conditions, will not cause permanent and significantharm to the environment during a monitoring period in which additionalinformation is gathered. If data gathered through monitoring indicate thatcontinued discharge may cause unreasonable degradation, the discharge mustbe halted or additional permit limitations established. The Director has concluded that there is sufficient information to determinethat exploratory oil and gas facilities operating under the effluent limitationsand conditions in this general permit will not cause unreasonable degradationof the marine environment pursuant to the Ocean Discharge Criteria guidelines.Conditions imposed under section 403(c) of the Act are discussed belowin Part IV.D., Requirements Based on the Ocean Discharge Criteria Evaluation.C. Section 308 of the Clean Water Act Under section 308 of the Act and 40 CFR 122.44(i), the Director must requirea discharger to conduct monitoring to determine compliance with effluentlimitations and to assist in the development of effluent limitations. EPAhas included several monitoring requirements in this permit, as listedin the table below. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Specific Permit Conditions</ITAG>A. Approach The determination of appropriate conditions for each discharge was accomplishedthrough: (1) Consideration of technology-based effluent limitations to control conventionalpollutants under BCT; (2) Consideration of technology-based effluent limitations to control toxicand nonconventional pollutants under BAT; and (3) Evaluation of the Ocean Discharge Criteria for discharges in the ChukchiSea lease sale area, assuming conditions in (1) and (2), above, were inplace. Discussions of the specific effluent limitations and monitoring requirementsderived from (1) through (3) appear below in Part IV.B. through D., respectively.For convenience, these conditions and the regulatory basis for each arecross-referenced by discharge in the following table:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1>Discharge and permit condition</H1><H1>Statutory basis</H1>Drilling muds and cuttings:<ITAG tagnum="2">Authorized muds and additives only<D>BAT.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">No oil-based muds<D>BCT.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">No diesel<D>BAT.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">10% max. oil content of cuttings<D>BCT.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">No free oil<D>BCT.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">3 mg/kg cadmium and 1 mg/kg mercury in barite<D>BAT.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Monitoring of metals, oil content and toxicity<D>Section 308.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Monitor volume discharged<D>Section 308.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Chemical inventory<D>Section 308.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Depth and area related discharge rate limits<D>Section 403(c).</D></ITAG>Deck drainage:<ITAG tagnum="2">No free oil<D>BCT.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Monitor discharge rate<D>Section 308.</D></ITAG>Sanitary wastes:<ITAG tagnum="2">No floating solids<D>BCT.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Chlorine 1.0 mg/1 (facilities with more than 10 people)<D>BCT.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Monitor discharge rate<D>Section 308.</D></ITAG>Domestic wastes:<ITAG tagnum="2">No floating solids<D>BCT.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Monitor discharge rate<D>Section 308.</D></ITAG>Miscellaneous discharges (Discharges 006 to 014 in the permit):<ITAG tagnum="2">No free oil<D>BCT.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Monitor discharge rate<D>Section 308.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Inventory of added substances<D>Section 308.</D></ITAG>Test fluids:<ITAG tagnum="2">pH 6.5-8.5<D>BCT andamp; Marine Water Quality Criteria.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">No free oil<D>BCT.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Oil andamp; grease limits: 48 mg/l monthly avg., 72 mg/l daily max<D>BCT.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Monitor frequency and volume of discharge<D>Section 308.</D></ITAG>All discharges:<ITAG tagnum="2">No halogenated phenol compounds, diesel oil, sodium chromate, sodiumdichromate, or trisodium nitrilotriacetic acid<D>BAT.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">No floating solids<D>BCT.</D></ITAG></ITAG>B. BCT Requirements1. <T3>Oil and grease in test fluids:</T3> Limited volumes of formation waterswhich are encountered during testing of the well are authorized for dischargeas test fluids. Under BPT oil and grease in discharges of produced waterwere limited to a 48 mg/l monthly average and a 72 mg/l daily maximum basedoil/water separation technologies. Since formation waters may be presentin test fluids, these limits are applied to the discharge of test fluidsunder BCT. This limitation is equal to BPT because Region 10 does not havetechnology performance data available at this time on which to base a morestringent limitation. As this limitation is equal to the BPT level of control,there is no incremental cost involved.2. <T3>Free oil and oil-based muds:</T3> No discharge of free oil is permittedfrom discharges authorized by this permit. Region 10 has determined thatthe BPT effluent limitations guideline of no discharge of free oil fromthe discharge of deck drainage, drilling muds, drill cuttings, and welltreatment fluids should apply to other discharges, including uncontaminatedbilge water, uncontaminated ballast water, test fluids, desalination unitwastes, boiler blowdown, non-contact cooling water, excess cement slurry,blowout preventer fluid, fire control system test water, mud, cuttingsand cement at the seafloor. Thus, the no free oil limitation is Region10's best professional judgment determination of BPT controls for thesedischarges. They have been subject to a no free oil limitation in previouspermits issued by Region 10, and past practices have not resulted in violationsof this limitation.Under the draft permit, the discharge of oil-based drilling muds (withoil as the continuous phase and water as the dispersed phase) is prohibitedsince oil-based muds would violate the BCT effluent limitation of no dischargeof free oil.No technology performance data available to Region 10 indicate that morestringent standards are appropriate at this time. Region 10 has, therefore,set BCT effluent limitations equal to the BPT level of control. As such,these limitations impose no incremental costs.Compliance with free oil limitation for deck drainage and miscellaneousdischarges will be by visual observation for a sheen on the receiving water,except for deck drainage and bilge water under the conditions describedbelow. This requirement is similar to that in the Region's BPT permitsand will not result in any additional costs to the industry. The requirementwas also a condition of Region 10's BAT/BCT permits for the Bering andBeaufort Seas (49 FR 23734, June 7, 1984), Norton Sound (50 FR 23578, June4, 1985), and Cook Inlet (51 FR 35460, October 3, 1986).Compliance with the free oil limitation for muds and cuttings will be monitoredby year-round use of the Static Sheen Test. The Static Sheen Test willalso be required for the monitoring of deck drainage and bilge water duringunstable or broken ice and stable ice conditions. This requirement formuds and cuttings was a condition of the Region's BPT permits and thusimposes no additional costs to industry. These requirements and those ondeck drainage and bilge water were also conditions of the Region's BAT/BCTpermits. Use of the Static Sheen Test will prevent a violation of the freeoil limitation due to those discharges most likely to be contaminated withoil. This would not be possible with an after-the-fact visual observationof a sheen on the receiving water.3. <T3>Oil content of cuttings:</T3> The draft general permit restricts thedischarge of oil-contaminated cuttings by prohibiting the discharge offree oil (see paragraph 2. above) and by limiting the maximum mineral oilcontent of cuttings. The limitation of 10 percent by weight on oil contentis based on the efficiency of conventional cuttings washers in removingoil from drill cuttings. Region 10 expects that if mineral oil-based drillingmuds or water-based muds with high concentrations of mineral oil additivesare used, drill cuttings would, at a minimum, have to be washed by cuttingswashers to meet the free oil limitation. The limitation on the maximumoil content of drill cuttings has been imposed as an additional means ofeffectively controlling the discharge of oil from cuttings associated withmuds.Region 10 expects that cuttings washers will routinely be required onlyfor drilling operations which use mineral oil-based drilling muds or water-basedmuds with high concentrations of mineral oil additives, and not for alldrilling operations. Due to the rare usage of muds by exploratory drillingoperations, very few, if any, Alaskan exploratory facilities will requirethe installation of cuttings washers. Any facility requiring a cuttingswasher to meet the 10 percent oil limitation is expected to already requirea cuttings washer to meet the BPT effluent limitation of no free oil. Therefore,there is no incremental cost involved beyond the cost of monitoring compliance,and the limitation passes the BCT costs test.Region 10 has taken an approach to controlling the oil content of cuttingswhich differs from that taken by Regions 4 and 6 in their Gulf of Mexicopermit (51 FR 284897, July 9, 1986). Regions 4 and 6 have imposed a visiblesheen test to determine compliance of cuttings with the no free oil limit,in combination with a prohibition on the discharge of cuttings from oil-basedmud systems. The prohibition on the discharge of cuttings from oil-basedsystems is necessary since some of these cuttings are expected to havefree oil and the visible sheen test results would not be evident untilafter a discharge to the receiving water had occurred. Region 10 has chosento require the Static Sheen Test rather than the visible sheen test. Anadvantage of the Static Sheen Test is that it is done prior to dischargeand cuttings which do not pass the test cannot be discharged. This testis also appropriate for the harsh weather and extended periods of darknesscommon in Alaska. Although the 10 percent oil limitation in Region 10 isless stringent than the prohibition by Regions 4 and 6 on discharges ofcuttings from oil-based mud systems, any cuttings which pass the 10 percentlimitation must also pass the Static Sheen Test prior to discharge.EPA is presently studying a newly developed technology for removing oiland grease from drill cuttings from oil-based and invert emulsion drillingmuds discharged into the Gulf of Mexico (52 FR 20262, March 31, 1987).This new technology, if successful, may be able to achieve a limit lowerthan 10 percent oil and grease and not result in the discharge of freeoil. Should this new information become available during the public noticeperiod, Region 10 will consider it in developing the final permit.The permit requires an analysis of drill cuttings for oil content dailywhen oil-based drilling fluids or oil additives are used. Analysis is alsorequired daily when drilling fluids could be contaminated with hydrocarbonsfrom the formation. In addition, analysis is required immediately on anysample that has failed the daily Static Sheen Test if a discharge has occurred.Two alternative analytical methods for determining the oil content of drillcuttings are specified in the permit: (1) The soxhlet extraction procedurefor oil and grease (as specified in 40 CFR Part 136), and (2) the AmericanPetroleum Institute retort distillation procedure for oil (RecommendedPractice 13B, 1980). The Region invites comments on the appropriatenessof either or both of these methods for determining compliance.4. <T3>pH:</T3> The pH of discharged test fluids (which may have a substantiallydifferent pH from that of the ambient receiving water) has been limitedto a range of 6.5-8.5 at the point of discharge. In Region 10's best professionaljudgment, this limitation appropriately equals a BPT level of control.No more stringent standard has been identified by the Region at this time.Therefore, Region 10 is setting a BCT effluent limitation for the pH oftest fluids equal to that of BPT. This limitation will ensure that pH changesgreater than 0.2 pH unit will not occur beyond the edge of the 100-metermixing zone (40 CFR 125.121(c)). This requirement has been and is routinelycomplied with by operations under previous BPT permits and thus, reflectsno cost incremental to BPT. 5. <T3>Floating solids:</T3> The BCT prohibition on floating solids is equalto the BPT level of control for sanitary wastes. As with the free oil limitationsfor other waste streams, Region 10 has determined that the BPT effluentlimitations guideline of no discharge of floating solids from the dischargeof sanitary wastes should apply to all other discharges as well. Thus,the no floating solids limitation is Region 10's best professional judgmentdetermination of BPT limitations for these discharges. They have been subjectto this limitation in previous permits issued by Region 10, and past practiceshave not resulted in violations of this limitation. No technology performancedata available to Region 10 indicate that a more stringent standard isappropriate at this time. Therefore, Region 10 has determined that theBCT effluent limitation on floating solids from these discharges is equalto the BPT level of control. As such, the extension of this limitationto all discharges will involve no incremental cost. 6. <T3>Chlorine:</T3> The requirement of maintaining residual chlorine levelsas close as possible to, but no less than 1 mg/1 in sanitary waste dischargesfor facilities manned by ten (10) or more people is a BCT determinationequal to BPT. There is therefore no incremental cost to the industry. C. BAT Requirements 1. <T3>Diesel oil:</T3> The discharge of drilling muds and associated cuttingswhich have been contaminated by diesel oil is prohibited. Diesel, whichis sometimes added to water-based mud system, is a complex mixture of petroleumhydrocarbons, kown to be highly toxic to marine organisms and to containnumerous toxic and nonconventional pollutants. While this limitation therebycontrols the toxic as well as nonconventional pollutants present in diesel,Region 10's primary concern is to control the toxic pollutants. The pollutant``diesel oil'' is being used as an ``indicator'' of the listed toxic pollutantspresent in diesel oil which are controlled through compliance with theeffluent limitation (i.e., no discharge). The technology basis for thislimitation is product substitution of less toxic mineral oil for dieseloil. Regarding the technology of product substitution, mineral oil-based fluidshave a demonstrated product development and performance as acceptable substitutesfor diesel oil-based fluids. This determination is based on the following:(1) The availability and successful formulation and use of chemical additivesthat are compatible with mineral oils (see 51 FR 29604-06, August 19, 1986),(2) the commercial availability of mineral oil spotting fluids (ibid.).and (3) the demonstrated performance of mineral oil spotting fluids asdocumented by published case histories (ibid.), and (4) a considerationof the performance statistics from the 1983-1984 American petroleum Association(API) surveys, the 1983-1986 Offshore Operators Committee (OOC) survey,and the Diesel Pill Monitoring Program (52 FR 36463-36464, September 29,1987). In previous notices and associated administrative records (Draft and FinalModification to the Bering and Beaufort Seas, Cook Inlet Final, and NortonSound Final) Region 10 has throughly discussed the basis for the limitationof diesel oil, as well as determinations regarding cost and environmentalconsiderations. This information is therefore not being repeated in detailhere; it is instead being incorporated by reference. One suggested alternative to the diesel oil prohibition would be to allowthe discharge of drilling muds in which a diesel pill had been used, providedthat the pill is removed and the residual drilling mud meets specifiedlimitations on oil content. Such as approach depends on accomplishing effectivepill removal such that the drilling mud can meet all other effluent limitations.The oil content limitation would be set at a level which not only reflectsBAT control of toxic pollutants in diesel oil but also provides adequatesafeguards for the marine environment. The Diesel Pill Monitoring Program(DPMP) was conducted to address the effectiveness of pill recovery in removingdiesel oil from drilling muds. Region 10 has concluded from results availableto date that the recovery techniques implemented in the DPMP were not successfulin recovering the diesel pill and reducing mud toxicity to acceptable levels(52 FR 36465-36466, September 29, 1987). Available DPMP results indicatethat the toxicity of drilling muds increases with their diesel oil content,and that pill recovery techniques currently in use are incapable of removingup to 30 percent of the diesel oil added as a pill. Hence, Region 10 hasdetermined that the prohibition on the discharge of drilling fluids andcuttings contaminated with diesel oil is appropriate for the BAT levelof control. Should new information from the study result in conclusionscontrary to those drawn from the preliminary results, the Region will considersuch new information in future permit determinations. Region 10 has considered using ``free oil,'' ``oil-based drilling fluids,''and ``oil content of cuttings'' as indicators of toxic pollutants. Whilethe Region has determined that such effluent limitations will control thedischarge of toxic pollutants in diesel oils, it is unnecessary to designatethese pollutants as indicators since the same levels of control have beenestablished under BCT, which are equal to levels of control required bythe BPT affluent limitations guidelines. Therefore, redundant limitationsunder BAT are not proposed for these pollutant parameters. In conclusion, Region 10 has evaluated alternative control technologiesand alternative control parameters to reduce the toxic pollutants in dischargeddrilling muds. Based upon this evaluation, the Region has determined thatthe prohibition on the discharge of diesel contaminated drilling mud isreasonable and appropriate since complete diesel pill recovery is unprovenand substitution of a mineral oil pill for a diesel pill is technologicallyfeasible and economically achievable. 2. <T3>Mercury and cadmium in barite:</T3> The permit contains limitationsof 1 mg/kg mercury and 3 mg/kg cadmium in barite, a major constituent ofdrilling muds. These restrictions are designed to limit the discharge ofmercury, cadmium, and other potentially toxic metals which can occur ascontaminants in some sources of barite. An identical limitation is includedin the general permits for the Bering and Beaufort Seas, Norton Sound,and Cook Inlet.As discussed in the fact sheets for the above permits, the justificationfor the limitation under BAT is product substitution; i.e., Alaskan operatorscan substitute ``clean'' barite, which meets the above limitations, forcontaminated barite which does not. Numerous offshore exploratory wellshave been drilled in Alaska over the past years, and chemical analyseshave shown that the barite used has not exceeded the limitations. Giventhat ``clean'' barite is available and that operators in the above referencedgeneral permit areas have been complying with an identical limitation,Region 10 believes that this limitation is both technologically feasibleand economically achievable.Region 10 has determined that it is impractical at this time to place thelimitations on drilling mud until additional data are collected. Furthermore,if the limitation were placed on the drilling mud rather than on the barite,it would not be feasible for an operator to determine in advance if thedischarge complied with the permit requirements since metals analyses mustbe conducted at commercial laboratories onshore. Such a requirement mayimpose costly and unreasonable delays while the analyses were being conducted.Region 10 does recognize the possibility of changes in the available supplyof ``clean'' barite. The draft permit contains a provision (Part II.B.1.g.)which would allow the Director the discretion to grant a waiver from thelimitations on a case-by-case basis if the permittee (1) satisfactorilydemonstrates that barite which meets the limitation is not available, and(2) provides results of analyses of the substitute barite. In determiningthe availability of ``clean'' barite under this provision, Region 10 willreasonably consider all relevant factors, including the cost of obtainingbarite which meets the limitations.3. <T3>Generic muds and authorized additives:</T3> The draft permit limitsthe discharge of toxic substances in drilling fluids by allowing only thedischarge of generic drilling muds (listed in Table 1 of the draft permit)and additives for which acceptable bioassay or chemical data are available.Permittees are required to certify in advance of discharge that only genericdrilling muds and authorized additives will be discharged.The generic muds listed on Table 1 of the draft permit are the same genericmuds listed on Table 1 of the Cook Inlet NPDES general permit (51 FR 35460,October 3, 1986). The six listed generic muds are the result of severalchanges to the original eight generic muds (listed on previous tables inpermits for Norton Sound, Bering Sea, and Beaufort Sea). Three lignosulfonatemuds (previously 2, 7, and 8) have been combined into a single mud, GenericMud No. 2. The Region will use the toxicity of the most toxic of the threemuds (old Generic Mud No. 8) in performing additive toxicity calculations.If a permittee requests authorization to discharge an additive in GenericMud No. 2 as listed in Table 2 of this draft permit and can demonstratethat generic mud components will not exceed the concentrations of old GenericMud Nos. 2 or 7, Region 10 will use the toxicity values for those mudsinstead. Reference to ``generic muds'' throughout this fact sheet meansthe six muds currently listed on Table 1 of the draft permit.Authorized additives which may be discharged in combination with GenericMuds Nos. 2 through 6 are listed in Table 2 of the draft permit. The Regionhas determined that the toxicity limitations (i.e., generic muds and authorizedadditives) constitute a reasonable approach which is expected to controlnot only listed toxic pollutants, but other toxic substances (i.e., toxicnonconventional pollutants) as well. The technology basis for this permitcondition is product substitution: That is, mud additives and componentswhich would cause the toxicity of a mud system to exceed that of GenericMud No. 1 can be replaced by less toxic mud additives and components. Thisprinciple has been successfully applied in Region 10 with the developmentof several ``non-generic'' muds. These ``non-generic muds'' are functionallysimilar to Generic Mud No. 1 but they are less toxic and may be used withspecialty drilling fluid additives (e.g., polymers) without exceeding thetoxicity of Generic Mud No. 1 (30,000 ppm spp using <T3>M. Bahia</T3>).Permittees may discharge additives listed in Table 2 of the draft permitup to the specified concentrations in Generic Muds Nos. 2 through 6 withoutprior authorization. This table is an updated version of Table 2 in theCook Inlet general permit (51 FR 35460, October 3, 1986). Tables 1 and2 of this permit may be updated during the effective period of the permit.Updated versions will be mailed to permittees when they become effective,and will supersede all earlier versions. Any additive or mud receivingauthorization in the future by update will be evaluated according to theregional criteria used for this permit before the tables are amended.Most additives listed in Table 2 of the permit may not be discharged inGeneric Mud No. 1 without prior authorization because Region 10 has determinedthat the addition of additives would cause the toxicity of the dischargedmud to be more toxic than Generic Mud No. 1 alone. The only additives listedon Table 2 which may be routinely added to Generic Mud No. 1 are: aluminumstearate; calcium carbide; cellophane flakes; flakes of silicate mineralmica; inert spheres (glass or plastic); basic zinc carbonate (Mil-Gard);crushed granular nut hulls; sodium polyphosphate; vegetable plus polymerfibers, flakes, and granules; zinc carbonate and lime; and zinc oxide (Sulf-XES). (Mention of any trade names or commercial products does not constituteendorsement or recommendation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.)These additives were originally authorized in Table 2 of the Bering Sea(AKG283000) and Beaufort Sea (AKG284000) general permits. They are notexpected to appreciably affect the toxicity of Generic Mud No. 1. Althoughthe most recent versions of Table 2 (Norton Sound [AKG287000] and CookInlet [AKG285000]) did not clearly exclude other additives from dischargein Generic Mud No. 1, the Region's authorizations in fact have not authorizedother additives. Thus, this condition is not expected to have any effecton industry.Any discharge of a generic mud which has been modified by addition of anadditive not listed in Table 2 requires prior authorization by Region 10.Permittees may request authorization to discharge additives (includingmineral oils) not listed in Table 2 by submitting appropriate informationand bioassay data in advance of discharge. Region 10 will determine whetherthe use of requested additives is likely to cause the mud system to bemore toxic than Generic Mud No. 1, which is the base formulation the Agencyuses to determine acceptable toxicity levels for discharge of fluids. Othercriteria (e.g., persistence and degradation) are also considered in theevaluation process, as appropriate. For the evaluation of mineral oil additivesthe draft permit contains a provision (Part II.B.1.f.) which allows anexception for the discharge of muds which exceed the toxicity of GenericMud No. 1 if the least toxic available alternative is discharged.In some cases, interim authorizations for the discharge of muds and additivesmay be granted if preliminary bioassay data are submitted and appear acceptablebut the Region determines that additional bioassay testing or other analysesare required. For example, such testing may be required to examine possiblecumulative or synergistic effects if the additive is to be used in combinationwith a number of other additives or if a ``non-generic mud'' (describedabove) is to be used, with or without additives. Because the additionaltesting may take a considerable amount of time to conduct, interim authorizationto discharge may be granted, if a reasonable amount of data are available,so that operations are not impaired for an unreasonable amount of time.The information obtained under the requirements of an interim authorizationwill be used in further evaluations of the subject additives or muds. Thus,interim authorizations do not set a precedent for future full authorizationof the subject additives or muds. Interim authorizations may require testinga used drilling mud from a rig.This approach to limiting toxicity is expected to control the dischargeof listed toxic as well as nonconventional pollutants in drilling muds.For example, the toxicity of muds containing lubricants, including mineraloil products, may vary widely, and such additives may greatly increasethe toxicity of the mud. Studies on diesel-contaminated drilling muds haveshown toxicity to be strongly correlated with the content of aromatic hydrocarbons,which include listed toxic pollutants. Some mineral oils also contain aromatichydrocarbons which are listed toxics, such as fluorene, naphthalene, andphenanthrene. The toxicity of muds containing these oils is assumed tobe caused, in part, by the listed toxic pollutants as well as by the nonconventionalpollutants. Region 10 has determined that it is technically and economicallyinfeasible to directly limit the toxic pollutants in drilling muds, asdiscussed above in Part IV.C.1. Therefore, the Region has determined thatthe toxicity limitations constitute a reasonable approach which is expectedto control not only listed toxic pollutants, but other toxic substances(i.e., toxic nonconventional pollutants) as well.Under section 308 of the Act, compliance with this permit condition willbe monitored in two ways. First, by requiring that permittees certify thatonly generic muds and authorized additives will be discharged; and second,by requiring that permittees submit an end-of-well inventory listing allchemicals and the amounts of each added to each mud system. In addition,permittees must analyze at least one mud sample for metals content andtoxicity. The draft permit requires that any discharged mud system whichhas a mineral oil lubricity or spotting agent must be sampled and analyzedwhen the mineral oil content is highest. In the event that no mineral oillubricity or spotting agents are used, analyses are required on a sampleof discharged mud use at the greatest well depth, typically referred toas an ``end-of-well'' sample. The metals data will be used to verify thatmercury and cadmium limits on barite are adequately controlling metal concentrationsin used muds. The Drilling Fluids Toxicity Test will provide a comparisonbetween the toxicity of used muds containing mixtures of additives andthe bioassay data submitted on individual additives prior to discharge.4. <T3>Other toxic and nonconventional compounds:</T3> Under the permit dischargesof the following pollutants are prohibited: Halogenated phenol compounds,trisodium nitrilotriacetic acid, sodium chromate, and sodium dichromate.The class of halogenated phenol compounds includes toxic pollutants, andsodium chromate and sodium dichromate contain chromium, also a toxic pollutant.Trisodium nitrilotriacetic acid is a nonconventional pollutant. The dischargeof these compounds was previously prohibited in the BPT general permitsfor the Beaufort Sea and Norton Sound (48 FR 54881, December 7, 1983) aswell as in the BAT/BCT general permits for the Bering and Beaufort Seas,Norton Sound, and Cook Inlet. These compounds are therefore subject toBAT limitation. Because operators complied with this provision in the BPTpermit, there is no additional cost to the industry. The draft permit contains a provision that the discharge of surfactants,dispersants, and detergents shall be minimized except as necessary to complywith the safety requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Administrationand the Minerals Management Service. These products contain primarily nonconventionalpollutants. This provision previously appeared in the BPT permits for theBeaufort Sea and Norton Sound, as well as in the Region's other BAT/BCTpermits. Because operators complied with the provision in the BPT permits,there is no additional cost to the industry. D. Requirements Based on the Ocean Discharge Criteria Evaluation 1. <T3>Drilling muds, cuttings, and washwater:</T3> Additional restrictionson these discharges are necessary to ensure no unreasonable degradationof the environment. Lease Sale 109 includes water depths that range from8 to 80 meters. Discharge rate limitations on total muds and cuttings havebeen established in the Ocean Discharge Criteria Evaluation process inorder to allow adequate dispersion of the discharges. These maximum ratesare: andbullet; 1,000 bbl/hr for discharges into waters greater than 40 m in depth;andbullet; 750 bbl/hr for discharges into waters greater than 20 m but notmore than 40 m in depth; and andbullet; 500 bbl/hr for discharges into waters from 8 m to not more than20 m in depth. These limits are necessary because for any given discharge rate, the dilutionof drilling muds and cuttings is not as great in shallow waters as in deeperwaters. However, at any particular water depth, greater dilution closeto the discharge point will be achieved with a lower discharge rate. Thesemaximum rates will ensure that acceptable toxicity limits will not be exceededat the edge of the 100 meter mixing zone (Bigham el al. 1984, p. 62). Additionally, two areas included in the draft permit are of particularconcern to Region 10. They involve discharges of drilling muds and cuttings(a) below-ice to water depths shallower than 20 meters (excluding ice thickness)and (b) within 1,000 meters of an area of biological concern (e.g., thegray whale feeding area between Pt. Franklin and Wainwright). For (a) above, the Director has determined that below-ice discharges toareas shallower than 20 meters will not cause unreasonable degradationof the marine environment provided that they are subject to the limitationsand conditions of the draft permit. Monitoring is also required to verifythat the discharge of effluents to these areas will not produce conditionsin the future that would lead to unreasonable degradation. This monitoringrequirement is the same as that required by the draft Beaufort Sea II generalpermit (52 FR 36617, September 30, 1987). Region 10 believes that the OOC(Offshore Operators Committee) model can successfully be used to predictthe fate of under-ice discharges into waters greater than 20 meters deep(excluding ice thickness). Concerning (b) above, the Director has determined that discharges within1,000 meters of an area of biological concern will not cause unreasonabledegradation of the marine environment provided that they are subject tothe limitations and conditions of the draft permit. The worst-case exploratorydrilling scenario has the potential for adversely impacting the abundanceand composition of immobile or sessile benthic invertebrates that providefood for marine mammals. The worst-case scenario was up to five wells drilledwith all mud systems discharged at the same location. If the dischargesfrom more than one well were placed at one location and were dispersedonly by low current velocities, the depth and rate of drilling mud sedimentationmay be great enough to affect the integrity of the benthic habitat, particularlyfor larval stages of invertebrates. Although the area of benthic habitataffected could be very small relative to foraging areas of endangered whalesand marine mammals like walrus, the possibility of effects to marine mammalsand special nursery areas of marine birds cannot be ruled out, given thelimited information available. Consequently, a conditional monitoring programis proposed, depending on the results of additional data gathered whenthe specific number and location of exploratory oil drilling sites areidentified (e.g., through exploration plans, biological surveys, and environmentalreports required by the Minerals Management Service). Monitoring of benthic invertebrate populations is needed to determine whetherthe benthic community is affected adversely by thin layers of drillingmuds and cuttings as suggested by the data presented in the ODCE for thislease sale. The requirement is conditional, dependent on a determinationof whether significant numbers of marine mammals are expected to be foragingin the area of the proposed exploratory drilling. If so, then a monitoringprogram and toxicity tests on the discharge must be conducted. The need for monitoring of additional exploratory drilling operations willhave to be decided on a case-by-case basis, dependent on the results ofthe initial monitoring program. The need for a benthic invertebrate monitoringprogram is based on at least two independent studies which have demonstratedthat as little as 0.1 cm (0.04 in) of drilling mud can adversely affectthe benthos (Turk and Risk 1981 and Atema et al. 1982). Atema et al. (1982)found that 1 mm of drilling mud covering a natural substrate caused severedelays in shelter construction by post-larval Atlantic lobsters. Further,Turk and Risk (1981) found that a sedimentation rate of 19 mm/month causeda ten-fold decline in the density of a tube-building amphipod.   The specifics of each monitoring program will be determined by the Directorin consultation with the Regional Environmental Supervisor of the AlaskaDepartment of Environmental Conservation and the permittee.   2. <T3>Other discharges (003-015). </T3>These discharges are adequately controlledby the technology-based limitations in Part II.C. through E. of the draftpermit to ensure no unreasonable degradation of the marine environmentdue to those discharges.   <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Other Legal Requirements   </ITAG><T3>A. Oil Spill Requirements   </T3>Section 311 of the Act prohibits the discharge of oil and hazardous materialsin harmful quantities. Routine discharges specifically controlled by thepermit are excluded from the provisions of section 311. However, this permitdoes not preclude the institution of legal action or relieve permitteesfrom any responsibilities, liabilities, or penalties for other, unauthorizeddischarges of oil and hazardous materials which are covered by section311 of the Act.   <T3>B. Endangered Species Act   </T3>Based on information in the Draft Ocean Discharge Criteria Evaluation andin the Draft Environmental Impact Statement prepared for Federal LeaseSale 109, EPA has concluded that the discharges authorized by this generalpermit are not likely to adversely affect any endangered or threatenedspecies nor adversely affect its critical habitat. EPA is requeting writtenconcurrence from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National MarineFisheries Service on this determination. Region 10 will consult with theservices as appropriate, depending upon the outcome of the request forconcurrence, and otherwise will comply with the requirements of section7 of the Endangered Species Act before issuing the final permit.   <T3>C. Coastal Zone Management Act </T3>   EPA has determined that the activities authorized by this general permitare consistent with local and state Coastal Management Plans. The proposedpermit and consistency determination will be submitted to the State ofAlaska for state interagency review at the time of public notice. The requirementsfor State Coastal Zone Management Review and approval must be satisfiedbefore the general permit may be issued.   <T3>D. Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act</T3>   No marine sanctuaries as designated by this Act exist in the vicinity ofthe permit areas.   <T3>E. State Water Quality Standards and State Certification</T3>   No state waters are included in this permit.   <T3>F. Executive Order 12291</T3>   The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from the reviewrequirements of Executive Order 12291 pursuant to section 8(b) of thatorder.   <T3>G. Paperwork Reduction Act   </T3>EPA has reviewed the requirements imposed on regulated facilities in thisdraft general permit under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>Most of the information collection requirements have alreadybeen approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in submissionsmade for the NPDES permit program under the provisions of the Clean WaterAct. In addition, the environmental monitoring requirements pursuant tosection 403(c) of the Clean Water Act in Part II.B.4 of this permit aresimilar to the monitoring requirements that were approved by OMB for thepreviously issued Beaufort Sea general permit (June 7, 1984; 49 FR 23734)and the Norton Sound general permit (50 FR 23578, June 4, 1985).The final general permit will explain how the information collection requirementsrespond to any OMB or public comments.H.
