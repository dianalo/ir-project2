The Changchun No. 1 Motor Vehicle Plant in northeastern China is to resume production of the CA770, one of three models of the Red Flag produced at the plant between 1958 and 1980, the overseas edition of the paper said.    China produced 1,516 Red Flag limos in the past for use by such Chinese leaders as Mao Tse-tung and visiting foreign dignitaries.    Some top leaders, including Deng Xiaoping, still use Red Flags, although Mercedes Benz and Japanese luxury cars have generally replaced the Red Flag as favored transportation for ranking Chinese.    China's auto industry went into decline around the time the Red Flag went out of production, but has recently shown signs of revival following the imposition of high tariffs on imports. </TEXT></DOC>
