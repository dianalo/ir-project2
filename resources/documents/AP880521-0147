But an account by Reuters correspondent Pascal Fletcher made nomention of injuries to him and said he and visiting journalistsnarrowly escaped flying shrapnel. Fletcher's report said threeAngolan soldiers and a civilian official were injured.   The report by the official Angolan news agency ANGOP, monitoredin Lisbon, said the attack came Thursday near the besieged southernAngolan town of Cuito Cuanavale. A separate ANGOP report said fourrebels were killed in fighting Saturday in the central city ofHuambo.   ANGOP said Fletcher and an unidentified Angolan journalist werehit by shrapnel from a 155mm shell that exploded 60 yards from anarmored personnel carrier transporting the visiting journalists.   The agency quoted the Saturday edition of the government-runJornal de Angola as saying an Angolan soldier was seriously woundedby the same shell.   However, Fletcher filed a report from Angola on Friday saying heand a group of foreign journalists narrowly escaped from twoexploding shells, Reuters said.   Fletcher's report said four people were injured by shrapnel,including a soldier beside him in the vehicle.   The correspondent was in the Angolan capital, Luanda, continuinghis assignment Saturday, the Lisbon bureau of the British newsagency said.   The ANGOP report gave no further details on the attack.   Fletcher is based in Lusaka, Zambia and has visited Angolaseveral times to report on the country's 13-year civil war.   Cuito Cuanavale, 190 miles north of Angola's border with SouthAfrican-administered Namibia, has been under siege since Septemberby South Africa and forces of the rebel National Union for theTotal Independence of Angola.   Cuito Cuanavale is a staging post for government offensivesagainst the Angolan guerrillas.   ANGOP reported security forces killed four UNITA guerrillas andwounded several others in a shootout Saturday in Huambo, foiling anattempt to sabotage installations of the Benguela railroad.   The report said four pounds of explosives, seven mortar shells,detonators and other arms were captured from the rebels.   Angola, South Africa and Cuba, are trying to reach an agreementon ending the war in Angola and granting independence toneighboring Namibia, also known as South-West Africa. The talks aresupported by the United States and the Soviet Union.   The rebels are fighting to force the Marxist Angolan governmentto share power. More than 40,000 Cuban soldiers back the governmentforces.
