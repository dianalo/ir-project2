The platform, to be adopted Thursday at a party congress inPretoria, includes removal of criminal penalties for residentialapartheid violations, more government subsidies for multiracialschools, removal of race as the major criterion for identifyingpolitical groups, a bill of rights, and negotiating a newconstitution with black leaders.   Much of the platform represents a softening of Nationalistpolicies aimed at maintaining white control.   In London, a leader of the outlawed African National Congressguerrilla group called it an advance, but from a wrong position.   ``It's a step forward to the extent that the National Partyrecognizes that South Africa cannot be ruled on the basis ofexclusive power for the white minority,'' said Thabo Mbeki,secretary for international affairs, en route to the ANC's base inLusaka, Zambia.   ``But the position is wrong because it continues to define peopleas black and white and not as the people of South Africa. The periodof transition must emerge from negotiations.''   Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe outlined the platformat a news briefing.   The five-year plan does not specifically say blacks could votedirectly for national representatives within five years, but van derMerwe and Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said that was what itforesees.   The platform appears consistent with the Nationalists' declaredgoal of providing blacks with a national political voice in a waythat would preserve rights for the whites and other minorities.Black activists seek a one-man, one-vote system that wouldeffectively transfer power to the black majority.   The platform is believed to reflect the thinking of NationalParty leader F.W. de Klerk, designated successor to President P.W.Botha, who says he will retire after elections Sept. 6.   The plan begins with the statement: ``South Africa is oneundivided state with one citizenship for all. Every South Africanhas the right to participate in political decision-making on alllevels of government which affect his interests, subject to theprinciple of no domination.''   Van der Merwe said that to keep the 5 million whites from beingdominated by the 28 million blacks, government officialscontemplated forming something like the U.N. Security Council, inwhich major powers have a veto on some issues, but not all.   Specifics are to be negotiated with ``recognized leaders of allgroups committed to the pursuit of peaceful solutions,'' the plansays.   Botha's government has been accused of jailing and silencinglegitimate black leaders, while seeking to negotiate with those whohave no constituency.   Van der Merwe said the Nationalists would modify their demandthat black negotiators renounce violence and require only that theybe committed to peaceful solutions.   The demand for renunciation of violence has been seen as anobstacle to talks with the ANC, which conducts guerrilla attacks inSouth Africa but says it also seeks peaceful solutions.   Groups, their identities and their rights still are a major partof the Nationalist manifesto, but van der Merwe said the plan callsfor ``a shift from the present race-defined groups to culturallydefined groups'' for political purposes, and for people in groups,not the government, to decide who can join.   He said this means that eventually, the Population RegistrationAct, a cornerstone law of apartheid, would ``cease to be required.''The act classifies South Africans racially, for purposes of housing,education, medical treatment, military service, political rights,and access to public amenities.   The Nationalists remain committed to racially segregated schoolsfor those who prefer them, but the platform commits the party toproviding ``a system of subsidized private schools for those whoprefer to live outside a specific group context.''   The government already subsidizes some private, multiracialschools. Van der Merwe and du Plessis said the plan envisagesexpanding the subsidies. Eventually, there would be a dualeducational system, racially segregated ``public schools'' andmultiracial ``private schools,'' both funded by the government.   The Group Areas Act, another pillar of apartheid, will remain onthe books, meaning it will still be a crime to live in aneighborhood designated for another race. But the party plan callsfor a system of ``assistance and negotiation'' to ``solve theproblem without legal intervention.''</TEXT></DOC>
