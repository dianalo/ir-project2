Several implant systems, e.g.the Paterson-Parker system and the Paris system, give instructions forthe optimal arrangement of sources to assure that the planned targetvolume is adequately covered. They also give guidelines to calculatethe reference dose rate encompassing the planned target volume. Thesesystems provide different solutions for the source arrangement for thesame planned target volume, and vice versa, resulting in different referencedose rates. The problem of dose specification is discussed. For a numberof theoretical implants predicted reference dose rates for the plannedtarget volume were compared with the computer calculated dose rates forthat volume. Discrepancies increase when moderate digressions from theadopted implant system rules are allowed, such as could commonly occurclinically. For a number of examples the degree of change in dose rate,if over 10%, and the position where this deviation is likely to occurare described. For optimal results the clinician should be well awareof these variations. 18 refs.; 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
