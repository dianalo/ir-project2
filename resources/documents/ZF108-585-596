Canion, president and CEO of CompaqComputer Corp., have held the top two positions in the annual salarysweepstakes.andP;  Even with Sculley's 1989 pay cut, Canion trailed Sculley with$2.11 million, although Canion's salary was $248,116 more than it was in1988.andM;The top executives reviewed by MacWEEK averaged total salaries of $779,393for 1989, up $9,986 from last year, but not as high as in 1987 when theyaveraged $858,264.andM;Salaries represent much of an executive's earnings, but stock holdings,profit sharing and other long-term benefits also play into year-end rewards.andO;While Sculley did not exercise any stock options in 1989, he did sell $5million worth of Apple stock last month.andP;  Last year, Jim P. Manzi, presidentand chairman of Lotus Development Corp., cashed in $15.3 million in stockoptions.andP;  Added to his annual salary of $991,358, Manzi made a total of $16.4million in 1989.andM;As a result, Forbes magazine last month rated Manzi as third in its list of&quot;Corporate America's Most Powerful People,&quot; based on income, while Sculleywas slotted as 90th.andM;Microsoft Corp.andP;  CEO and Chairman William H. Gates III may have something tosay about that.andP;  Gates' relatively spartan salary of $191,314 sharplycontrasts with his fat stock holdings.andP;  Gates owns a whopping $2.4 billion ofMicrosoft stock, leaving the rest of the industry in the dust.andP;  Gates'closest contenders are Hewlett-Packard Co. co-founders David Packard andWilliam Hewlett, with $1.75 billion and $1.3 billion in stock holdings,respectively.andM;Female executives in the computer industry continue to earn far less thantheir male counterparts.andP;  Sandra Kurtzig, chairman of Ask Computer SystemsInc., brought in less than $200,000 for the 1989 fiscal year, the companysaid.andM;Apple would not disclose the salaries of either of its top female executives,Deborah Coleman, vice president of Apple's Information Services andTechnology group, and Debbie Biondolillo, vice president of human resourcesfor Apple USA.andM;Reflecting the ascension of Conner Peripherals Inc., the disk drive maker'stop two executives took home hefty raises in the past year.andP;  Finis F. Conner,chairman and CEO of Conner Peripherals Inc., garnered an additional $449,725.andO;The raise more than doubled his salary to $704,138.andP;  Executive Vice PresidentJohn P. Squires received a $298,477 raise, raising his salary to $488,359.andM;Executives whose salaries have declined since 1988 include former industryleaders Edward M. Esber Jr.andP;  and Delbert Yocam.andP;  Esber, who resigned thisspring from his position as Ashton-Tate Corp. chairman and CEO, lost $246,978in salary and bonuses last year.andP;  Yocam, formerly senior vice president ofApple, earned $137,321 less in 1989 than he did in 1988.andM;Salaries used in the MacWEEK survey are based on figures listed in companyproxy statements, which must disclose the top five executives' pay, accordingto the Securities and Exchange Commission.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
