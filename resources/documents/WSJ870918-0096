One was about the progress of a local railroad. The other: &quot;Are the Japanese buying Los Angeles?&quot;    The answer to the second query was yes. Half of downtown Los Angeles is owned by foreigners, and half of that by Japanese. Foreigners also own 39% of the office space in Houston, 21% in New York's huge financial district, and 12% in Washington, where their tenants include the U.S. Department of Justice.    The U.S., it would seem, is trying to balance its trade by exporting its land, or at least the underlying deeds. Although Canadians are still the biggest foreign owners of U.S. real estate, the Japanese, if their current buying spree continues, will soon overtake them.    According to Salomon Brothers Inc., Japanese investors spent $4.1 billion on U.S. real estate in 1986, up from a mere $700 million the previous year. In 1987 they are buying even more, spending $2.2 billion in the first six months.    &quot;This is more than just another wave,&quot; James O'Brien, a vice president in Coldwell Banker's Boston office, says of the Japanese acquisition binge. &quot;It's a sea change.&quot;    Starting with the 17th century Dutch, foreigners with cash long have desired a piece of America. In recent years, they have come in waves: the British, after exchange controls were lifted in 1979; the Germans and Dutch, financed by big banks and pension funds; the Arabs, loaded with petrodollars; and the Canadians, led by Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd.    The Japanese are merely the latest to arrive. But don't let that fool you. &quot;This isn't like the Arabs&quot; -- or anyone else, says Jack Shaffer, a managing director of mortgage broker Sonnenblick-Goldman Corp.    The British and Dutch continue to invest in the U.S., mainly on the East Coast. But neither has matched the record sums being shelled out by the Japanese.    Arabs paid hefty prices, especially for buildings in Houston, but when the price of oil cracked, so did their interest in real estate. However, the Japanese seem to have an inexhaustible supply of dollars to recycle.    While the total amount of U.S. real estate owned by the Japanese is but a tiny fraction of the entire country, there isn't any doubt that they are skimming off the cream.    Since the beginning of 1986, most of the office buildings in the U.S. that have sold for more than $100 million have been sold to Japanese. When it comes to bidding on prime office towers in major cities, domestic powerhouses such as Equitable Real Estate Investment Management Inc. and Prudential Realty Group have all dropped out of the competition. &quot;You don't see anybody bidding against the Japanese,&quot; says an official at one big institution. &quot;They're being priced out of the market.&quot;    American developers are taking a back seat as well. Gerald Hines Interests is building a 50-story tower in Los Angeles. But Hines, once one the country's most active developers, is merely the manager on this project: The owner is Mitsui Fudosan Real Estate Development Co., which also owns the Exxon building in midtown Manhattan.    The buying binge has more or less the same explanation as Tokyo's soaring stock market. Japan has a lot of money to invest, and few places to put it.    &quot;Japan has an internal problem,&quot; says Naomi Okada, a New York-based real estate broker. Rates of return on Japanese real estate are next to nothing, he explains, making investments in the U.S. more attractive.    Americans don't think of Manhattan as cheap, but compared with Tokyo, it is. And for a Japanese, the soaring yen has made New York cheaper still. Also, the Japanese are willing to accept lower rates of return -- and therefore pay higher prices -- than U.S. buyers because they are investing with a longer term, usually 25 years, in mind.    &quot;They're assuming we're going to have inflation and they're willing to ride it out,&quot; says Bruce Moulthrop, head of acquisitions for Equitable. &quot;We're not willing to wait as long.&quot;    The strategy has its risks. If inflation in the U.S. doesn't reignite, Japanese owners will find it tougher to jack up rents. And the strategy doesn't take into account the risk of obsolescence. It is difficult today, for instance, to rent a 1950s building at premium prices.    So far, the Japanese have purchased almost exclusively 'Class A' office buildings, usually fully leased and relatively new, in a handful of cities: New York, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Boston, as well as hotels in Hawaii. Mr. Moulthrop, like others who have been outbid by the Japanese, concedes that they are buying &quot;excellent real estate.&quot;    But there is a limited amount of it left in the major coastal cities. One big question: Will the Japanese move inland? &quot;They have sort of forgotten about mid-America,&quot; says William Stern, of Sonnenblick. &quot;That will have to change, because they have so much money. They walk in here every day, and there aren't enough deals to sell them.&quot;    A real estate specialist with a New York bank agrees. &quot;There are only so many buildings they can buy,&quot; he says. &quot;After you strip Park Avenue, where do you go?&quot;    Much of America is eager to have these foreign investors. The Japan-American Society of Georgia recently invited 15 Japanese investors for a weekend of getting &quot;educated&quot; about the benefits of investing there. Allen Judd, a co-founder of the group, likens Japan to &quot;a bathtub that is overflowing, and the water is money.&quot; Needless to say, he reckons Atlanta could soak up some of the spillage.    The Japan-Miami Business Council is distributing videotapes and brochures about the city in Japanese. Philip Blumberg, a developer who has made several trips to Japan, says, &quot;It's the stability of Japanese investment that we're after. Once a Japanese company does a project in a city like Miami, more will come. They're a confidence builder, not just someone playing the market.&quot;    Japanese are already showing interest in Chicago. Nippon Life Insurance Co. is developing an office tower there with Prudential, and Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. recently bought a half interest in a tower from Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. And Orient Leasing Co., a Tokyo financial service company, recently agreed to acquire a 23% stake in Rubloff Inc., one of the Windy City's biggest real estate concerns.    Japanese investors also are nibbling in Atlanta and Dallas. But they are likely to move slowly in interior cities. And for the most part, they have limited their real estate purchases to office buildings, although some think that could change. Mr. Cushman, the broker, expects that more Japanese will begin to turn to developing and owning shopping centers, hotels, industrial sites and possibly even residential projects around the U.S.    They already are a major source of real estate financing. In a typical deal, Sanwa Bank recently provided the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Boston with $65 million in credit. And Hartz Mountain Industries Inc., a big New Jersey developer, got financing for eight industrial properties from Japanese banks.    &quot;There has been a reluctance to have a partner so far away,&quot; says one real estate banker. &quot;I think you'll see more complicated deals as both sides become more comfortable.&quot;    One of the first to try is Kumagai Gumi. The big Japanese construction firm is developing eight residential and hotel projects in New York, in partnership with Zeckendorf Co. and others in the U.S. Japanese firms control several development sites in Los Angeles, and one million square feet of industrial space in Dallas.    Others are likely to follow, if only because even some Japanese are beginning to find office-building prices too high.    With development, however, comes risk. Hiro Real Estate Co., for instance, paid $105 million to Donald Trump for a building at 650 Madison Ave. in New York. Hiro, however, grossly underestimated the cost of expanding the building, partly because of an unexpected encounter with an underground river, according to industry sources. The result will be to make the completed building much more expensive than Hiro had anticipated.    Whether Japanese investors turn out to have overpaid for this and other properties probably depends on what they do with them. &quot;Real estate not only has to be bought,&quot; says Coldwell's Glenn Whitmore, &quot;it has to be managed.&quot;    ---   Mr. Lowenstein reports on real estate from The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.    ---                    The Foreign Landlord   Percentage of downtown office space in major U.S. citiesowned by foreigners    Atlanta                                     18%    Boston                                      10%    Chicago                                      8%    Dallas                                      17%    Denver                                      19%    Houston                                     39%    Los Angeles                                 46%    Miami                                       18%    Minneapolis                                 32%    N.Y.
