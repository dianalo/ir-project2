That, at least, is what a team of scientists predicts willhappen in eastern North America if the so-called greenhouseeffect warms the Earth's climate as much as other scientistsare forecasting. Various computer models of the Earth'sclimate predict that the mean surface temperature willincrease between 1.5 degrees and 4.5 degrees Celsius over thenext 100 years as a result of humans pouring increasingamounts of heat-trapping gases, such as carbon dioxide, intothe atmosphere.</LP><TEXT>   In a report in this week's issue of Science, a team ofthree scientists describe their use of a computer model ofclimate-induced changes in eastern U.S. vegetation to seewhat might happen if the warming predictions prove true. Theychecked the accuracy of their computer model by running itbackwards in time 18,000 years. The model's &quot;prediction&quot;matched what the paleoclimatologists had already deduced fromthe record of pollen fossils about past climate-triggeredvegetation changes.   &quot;Future globally averaged warming will likely be morerapid than at any time during the past 18,000 years,&quot;declared paleoclimatologist Jonathan T. Overpeck of theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, geographerPatrick J. Bartlein of the University of Oregon and geologistThompson Webb III of Brown University.   &quot;The potential change in eastern North American vegetationwithin the next 200 to 500 years therefore may be larger thanthe total amount of change that took place during the past10,000 years,&quot; they wrote.   The computer models &quot;suggest that spruce populations inthe Eastern U.S. will decline in abundance, as willpopulations of northern pines,&quot; they said. The southern-mostlimit of spruce forests could move north as much as 1,000kilometers, or 600 miles, leaving much of New England, NewYork, Pennsylvania and the Great Lakes regions bereft ofthose evergreens.   The present-day mixed conifer-hardwood forests of thesestates would rapidly change to forests dominated by broadleaftrees, &quot;particularly with large increases in oak abundance inthe northern Great Lakes and New England regions,&quot; theypredicted.   Southern pine also will spread northward by as much as 500to 1,000 kilometers, they found. Birch would retreatnorthward, possibly disappearing from the mid-Atlanticstates.   &quot;A large eastward expansion of prairie forb abundancesacross the northern U.S.,&quot; is likely, they said, referring tothe non-grass plants that cover the prairies north and westof the Great Lakes.</TEXT></DOC>
