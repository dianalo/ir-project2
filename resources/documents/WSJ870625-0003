Bere.    The company wouldn't say whether the executive, Clarence E. Johnson, was forced out of the top job or chose to leave. But a source familiar with his departure said Mr. Johnson had decided to collect between $9 million and $12 million in &quot;golden parachutes&quot; and other payments triggered by a change in the company's ownership and spend more time with his family while letting Mr. Bere direct the company.    The company said Mr. Johnson would continue as president and a director at least through the transition, and a source familiar with the change said Mr. Johnson was expected to stay even longer.    Borg-Warner wouldn't comment further on Mr. Johnson's departure, beyond a statement that it wanted to call on Mr. Bere's 14 years of experience running Borg-Warner as the company makes the shift from public to private ownership. Borg-Warner is in the process of going private in a leveraged buyout. Mr. Bere served as chief executive from 1972 through April 1986.    Neither Mr. Bere nor Mr. Johnson could be reached for comment. Mr. Bere, 64 years old, had planned to retire as chairman this August, and although there had never been an announcement, it was widely assumed that Mr. Johnson, 60, would get the additional title of chairman. James E. Olson, chairman and chief executive of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., said Mr. Johnson's resignation wasn't in the planning several months ago, when Mr. Olson was still on Borg-Warner's board. Mr. Olson wouldn't comment further on the change.    It wasn't clear what role Merrill Lynch Capital Partners played in the change. The Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. unit is leading the group that is taking Borg-Warner private. The investor group owns 95% of Borg-Warner's stock, and Merrill Lynch executives now hold six of the nine seats on Borg-Warner's board.    The Borg-Warner spokeswoman wouldn't say whether Mr. Bere was expected to remain head of the company or whether his appointment would be temporary, but a source familiar with the change said Mr. Bere would stay for some time.    Mr. Bere, a leader in Chicago's business community, is generally credited with spotting early the country's transition from a manufacturing to a service economy. As the head of Borg-Warner, he took what was primarily an auto-parts company and transformed it into an unusual mix of manufacturing and services, adding financial services, armored transport, security-alarm and information businesses.    Mr. Johnson became chief executive of the company just months before Irwin Jacobs, the Minneapolis financier, and GAF Corp., a Wayne, N.J., chemicals and building materials concern, made bids for Borg-Warner. After a five-month battle, Mr. Johnson fended off the bids with the plan to take Borg-Warner private.    Borg-Warner is expected to file a proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission shortly for a shareholder meeting to vote on the leveraged buyout plan. A company spokeswoman said there weren't any other big changes planned at the company during the move to private ownership, although Borg-Warner has previously said it wants to sell its financial-services unit. </TEXT></DOC>
