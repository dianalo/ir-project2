Mrs. Rogers said she understood many people stood on the streetand stared at her burned-out van and asked, ``How could it happen?How could it happen here?''   ``That's what a terrorist wants us to do, to create unreasonedfear, isolation ... and forced modification of our lifestyles,''Mrs. Rogers said. ``But determination in our hearts to ensure thatthis does not occur turns a terrorist victory into defeat. Aunified community is an aware community and the execution of crimebecomes much more difficult.''   Mrs. Rogers, who has made few public appearances since the March10 bombing, was among five women whose lives have been torn byviolent crime to address the luncheon.   Crime Stoppers is administering the $40,000 reward fundestablished in the case of the van bombing, which occurred at a SanDiego intersection as Mrs. Rogers drove to work alone. She got outjust as flames engulfed the vehicle.   Authorities suspect the attack may have been in retaliation forthe mistaken downing last July of an Iranian airliner by the USSVincennes, commanded by Capt. Will C. Rogers III.   All 290 people aboard the jetliner were killed when theVincennes, engaged in a surface skirmish with Iranian gunboats,fired two missiles at what it thought was an attacking Iranianfighter jet.   Mrs. Rogers did not discuss her dismissal from her teaching jobat a private school whose officials were worried students and staffmight be caught in terrorism's crossfire. Mrs. Rogers accepted a$135,000 cash settlement from the school in exchange for leavingthe job she held for 12 years, but says she wants to continueteaching and is looking for a job.   Her husband is scheduled to be relieved as Vincennes skipper inchange of command ceremonies Saturday. Rogers' new assignment is atthe Navy's Tactical Training Group on Point Loma.</TEXT></DOC>
