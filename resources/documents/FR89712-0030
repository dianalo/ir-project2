On July 1, 1987, EPA promgulated newambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter which arebased upon the measurement of particles having an aerodynamic diameterof 10 microns or less (PM<T2>10</T2>). Consequently, states are required to develop plans whichprovide for attainment and maintenance of the new standards. The New Jerseystatewide SIP revision demonstrates that the existing SIP for total particulate(TSP) is adequate to provide for attainment and maintenance of the PM<T2>10</T2> standards.This notice also announces EPA's proposed approval of a request from theState of New Jersey to revise the air quality TSP designation for areasin the following Air Quality Control Regions (AQCRs): New Jersey-New York-ConnecticutInterstate AQCR; and Metropolitan Philadelphia Interstate AQCR. Specifically,this action means that the air quality in these locations will now be designatedas ``unclassifiable'' with respect to particulate matter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received by August 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>All comments should be addressed to: William J.

Background</ITAG>In 1971, EPA promulgated primary and secondary national ambient air qualitystandards (NAAQS) for particulate matter, measured as ``total suspendedparticulate matter'' or ``TSP.'' The primary standards were set at 260andCx.18;g/m\3\, 24-hour average not to be exceeded more than once per year,and 75 andCx.18;g/m\3\, annual geometric mean. The secondary standard, alsomeasured as TSP, was set at 150 andCx.18;g/m\3\, 24-hour average not to beexceeded more than once per year. In accordance with sections 108 and 109of the Clean Air Act (CAA), EPA has reviewed and revised the health andwelfare criteria upon which the primary and secondary particular matterstandards were based.In a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice published on July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24634),EPA announced its final decisions regarding changes to the particular matterstandards. Specifically, (1) TSP was replaced as the indicator for determiningattainment of particular matter standards by a new indicator that consistsof measuring only particles with an aeodynamic diameter less than or equalto a nominal 10 micrometers (PM<T2>10</T2>); (2) replacing the 24-hour primary standard with a 24-hourPM<T2>10</T2> standards of 150 ug/m\3\ with no more than one expected exceedanceper year; (3) replacing the annual primary TSP standard with a PM<T2>10</T2> standard of 50 andCx.18;g/m\3\, expected annual arithmetic mean;and (4) replacing the secondary TSP standard with 24-hour and annual PM<T2>10</T2> standards that are identical in all respects to the primarystandards.The new PM<T2>10</T2> indicator was selected since it includes all the particlessmall enough to cause the adverse health effects associated with breatingparticle-laden air. These smaller particles are detrimental to human respiratoryhealth due to their ability to penetrate the sensitive alveolar regionsof the lung.A. Group DesignationsBecause PM<T2>10</T2> air quality data was lacking in most areas of the country,EPA could not arbitrarily designate areas of attainment/nonattainment.EPA then developed an analysis using historical ambient TSP data and anyavailable PM<T2>10</T2> data to classify all counties in the nation into one of threegroups based upon the statistical probability of not attaining the newPM<T2>10</T2> standards. EPA has classified the following: (1) Areas witha probability of not attainment the PM<T2>10</T2> standard of at least 95 percent as ``Group I,'' (2) areas witha prbability of not attaining the PM<T2>10</T2> standard of between 20 and 95 percent as ``Group II,'' and(3) areas with a probability of not attaining the PM<T2>10</T2> standard of less than 20 percent as ``Group III.'' All areasare currently conducting ambient monitoring to determine whether actualambient PM<T2>10</T2> concentrations are above or below the PM<T2>10</T2> NAAQS.B. SIP RevisionsFor Group I areas, a State Implementation Plan (SIP) is required with sufficientPM<T2>10</T2> control strategies included to demonstrate attainment and maintenanceof the standard. For Group II areas, the state must submit a ``committal''SIP that supplements the existing TSP SIP with enforceable commitments.Specifically, commitments include: plans to collect and analyze PM<T2>10</T2> ambient air quality data; and report violations to the EPARegion II Office. For Group III areas, existing SIP documents are adequatebut the SIP revision must include provisions for the Prevention of SignificantDeterioration (PSD) and PM<T2>10</T2> monitoring. A full SIP revision would be required for a GroupII of Group III area if a monitoring site records four exceedances of thePM<T2>10</T2> 24-hour standard over a three year period or less, or if thePM<T2>10</T2> annual arithmetic mean is greater than 50 mg/m3 based on threeconsecutive years of data.Each SIP for particulate matter must be revised as follows: (1) To includestate ambient air quality standards for PM<T2>10</T2> at least as stringent as the NAAQS; (2) to trigger preconstructionreview for new or modified sources which would emit significant amountsof either PM or PM<T2>10</T2> emissions; (3) to invoke the emergency episode plan to preventPM<T2>10</T2> concentrations from reaching the significant harm level of600 mg/m3; (4) to meet ambient PM<T2>10</T2> monitoring requirements of 40 CFR Part 58; and (5) to meetthe requirements of 40 CFR 53.322 and 51.323 to report actual emissionsof PM<T2>10</T2> (beginning with emissions for calendar year (CY) 1988) forpoint sources emitting 100 tons per year or more.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. SIP Content and Review </ITAG>On May 31, 1988 the State of New Jersey submitted a SIP for PM<T2>10</T2> which contains the following: (1) Current particulate air qualitydata for the two Group II urban areas of Camden and Jersey City; (2) descriptionof existing and proposed PM<T2>10</T2> monitoring networks for the entire State; (3) air quality controlof particulate matter under existing regulations and controls; (4) PSDfrom new sources and modifications and; (5) additional commitments forthe two urban areas of Camden and Jersey City including an exceptionalevent study at the PJP landfill on August 23, 1985 in Jersey City. In NewJersey, EPA has designated Camden and Jersey City as Group II areas. Therest of the State is designated as Group III.A. MonitoringSince 1983, EPA has been assisting in and encouraging states to developPM<T2>10</T2> monitoring networks. As a result, New Jersey has PM<T2>10</T2> instruments operating at 16 monitoring sites where TSP concentrationshad historically been high and/or where local emission sources contributeto PM<T2>10</T2> concentrations. The following sampling frequencies are beingobserved for the different areas in New Jersey: (1) Group II areas requirefor one year or its equivalent, every other day PM<T2>10</T2> sampling at the site of maximum concentration with other siteson a six day sampling schedule and; (2) for Group III area, PM<T2>10</T2> monitoring is in a sixth day schedule at any site.B. Pre-Construction Review, New Source Review (NSR) and Prevention of SignificantDeterioration (PSD)New source review in TSP nonattainment areas will continue to be coveredunder the New Jersey Air Pollution Control Act (New Jersey Statutes Annotated(N.J.S.A.) 26:2c-1 et. seq. ) (Attachment 5 of State Submittal). This providesthe authority to require permits to construct, install or alter controlapparatus. Also, the applicant must demonstrate, to the satisfaction ofthe New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), that theequipment incorporates advances in the art of air pollution control developedfor the kind and amount of air contaminant emitted.NJDEP has promulgated regulations under Title 7, Chapter 27 of the NewJersey Administrative Code (N.J.A.C.), to address the control of particulateemissions from activities and source operations (see attachments 6 through15 of the State submittal). In enforcing the state-of-the art requirement,NJDEP requires emission rates which are at least as stringent as the EPAdefinition of ``best available control technology.'' N.J.A.C. 7:27-8 requiresa new permit for new modified sources regardless of the magnitude of theemission increase. Therefore, an increase which may be defined as ``significant''is regulated by the NSR/PSD program regardless of whether it is TSP orPM<T2>10</T2>.With respect to PSD, EPA has delegated authority to NJDEP to enforce thefederal PSD program. Once TSP areas have been designated as attainmentor unclassifiable, all new or modified construction at a major facilitymust conform to PSD review. TSP increments will continue to be used underPSD review until new PM<T2>10</T2> increments are established. The emission limits which are assumedto protect the NAAQS in the Group III areas are cited in N.J.A.C. 7:27-4and 7:27-6. Additionally, N.J.A.C. 7:27-13, ``Ambient Air Quality Standards,''(Attachment 13 of the State submittal) has been revised to incorporatethe PM<T2>10</T2> standards.C. Regulations and Consent OrdersThe State of New Jersey is maintaining all existing regulations and/orconsent orders which pertain to particulate control. However, regulationsand/or consent orders are revised to include PM<T2>10</T2> as the new NAAQS.<T3>D. Annual National Emissions Data System (NEDS) Emissions Data Reporting </T3>The state of New Jersey reports actual and/or allowable emissions datafor point sources emitting 100 tons/year or more of any criteria pollutanteach year. This information is entered by EPA into NEDS. In February, 1989,NJDEP staff has submitted a mail survey package to facilities with allowabletotal particulate matter (TPM) greater than 100 tons per year (TPY). Theplant operators will be required to provide to NJDEP speciated particulateemissions to quantify both TPM emissions and PM<T2>10</T2> emissions. The end product of the survey (to be completed inAugust, 1989) will be an inventory of point source allowable and actualTPM emissions, and an inventory of point source allowable and actual PM<T2>10</T2> emissions starting with calendar year 1988.  <T3>E. Changes to State Emergency Episode Plans  </T3>The purpose of air pollution episode levels and contingency plans is toprevent air pollution from reaching the ``significant harm levels'' prescribedin the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 51.151). The prevention andcontrol of air pollution emergency episodes is regulated by N.J.A.C. 7:21-12and Administrative Order Number Thirty-Eight (Attachments 12 and 23 ofthe State submittal).  <T3>F. Group II Areas_Camden, Camden County and Jersey City, Hudson County </T3>Based on monitored data collected in the City of Camden since May 1, 1985and in Jersey City since January 13, 1987, EPA has classified these twoareas as Group II PM<T2>10</T2> areas. Consequently, New Jersey has committed to the requirementsfor Group II areas as stated in the July 1, 1987 notice (52 FR 24681). <ITAG tagnum="81">(1) PM</ITAG><T2>10</T2> Monitoring for New Jersey Group II and Group III Areas  The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) has committedresources for the demonstration of the attainment status of the two GroupII areas and for the demonstration of maintenance of the PM<T2>10</T2> NAAQS in the Group III areas in New Jersey.  The attainment status of the Camden urban area will be determined basedupon an every-six-day operating schedule in accordance with 40 CFR 58.113.PM<T2>10</T2> monitoring was initiated at the Morris-Delair Water TreatmentPlant, Pennsauken, Camden County, on May 1, 1985. As of December 31, 1988,an arithmetic mean of 35.6 mg/m\3\ was recorded for the three year period. The attainment status of the Jersey City urban area will be based uponan every-other-day operating schedule in accordance wtih 40 CFR 58.13.PM<T2>10</T2> monitoring was initiated at the Newark Avenue site, JerseyCity, Hudson County on January 13, 1987. As of December 31, 1988 an arithmeticmean of 38.0 mg/m\3\ was recorded at the Newark Avenue site.  <ITAG tagnum="81">(2) The Identification of Air Quality Data Affected by an ExceptionalEvent at the PJP Landfill on August 23, 1985  </ITAG>NJDEP operates an inhalable particulate (IP) sampler on the roof of theHudson County Safety and Health Department Building on Duncan Avenue inJersey City. During the 1985 calendar year, 57 valid samples were collectedat that site. On August 23, 1985 the site's sole exceedance of the 24-hourPM<T2>10</T2> standard for the year, 308 mg/m\3\, was recorded. On the sameday, major hazardous site mitigation activities occurred at the PJP Landfillabout 0.3 miles away.  In 1977, the PJP Landfill was closed after more than twenty years of operation.However, subsurface fires that were ignited during the mid-1950's continuedto smolder. Efforts to extinguish these fires began in August, 1985. Theremediation efforts involved the use of an experimental fire fighting foamwhich was applied to the landfill surface and injected into its subsurface.This was followed by the evacuation, dousing and compaction of the landfillmaterial. After the fire was extinguished, PM<T2>10</T2> readings at the Duncan Avenue site fell to where the arithmeticmean is 43.5 mg/m\3\ as of December 31, 1988.  On January 28, 1988, NJDEP submitted an exceptional event study for thePJP Landfill and requested that EPA flag the August 23, 1985 reading asan exceptional event. On February 10, 1988, EPA Region II concurred thatthe long-burning fire at the PJP Landfill constitutes an exceptional eventas defined in EPA's ``Guidelines on the Identification and Use of Air QualityData Affected by Exceptional Events'' (EPA-450/4-86-007).  <ITAG tagnum="81">(3) Air Quality Control of Particulate Matter  </ITAG>EPA believes existing State regulation as well as both State and FederalMotor Vehicle Emissions Control Programs are sufficient to provide forattainment and maintenance of the PM<T2>10</T2> standards in the Cities of Camden and Jersey City. Also, thecontrol measures in the existing TSP SIP will continue to be enforced.For the Group II areas of Camden and Jersey City, upon declaring attainmentof the NAAQS (within 37 months of promulgation of the standard), NJDEPwill cite the federally enforceable emission limits in the existing TSPSIP assumed to protect the NAAQS and establish an emissions trading baseline.Also, for the Group III areas (the rest of the State) NJDEP will site theemission limits in the existing TSP SIP assumed to protect the NAAQS. <ITAG tagnum="81">(4) Additional commitments for the Group II Areas of Jersey City andthe city of Camden</ITAG>The State of New Jersey has committed to the following:i. Analyze and verify the ambient PM<T2>10</T2> air quality data and report 24-hour PM<T2>10</T2> exceedances to the EPA Region II office within 45 days of eachexceedance. After an equivalent monitoring period (three years), analyzeair quality data and determine the long term monitoring requirement andattainment status.ii. Within 30 days of notification of a PM<T2>10</T2> exceedance or within 30 months of promulgation of the PM<T2>10</T2> standard, which ever comes first, determine whether the measuresin the existing Camden or Jersey City TSP SIP will assure the timely attainmentand maintenance of the primary PM<T2>10</T2> standards and immediately notify EPA Region II.iii. Within 6 months after notifying EPA Region II of a PM<T2>10</T2> nonattainment problem, adopt a PM<T2>10</T2> control strategy that assures attainment within three yearsfrom the approval date of the PM<T2>10</T2> SIP revision for the Camden and Jersey City Group II areas.<ITAG tagnum="81">(5) Schedule of Activities</ITAG>The SIP revision shall demonstrate that both daily and annual NAAQS forPM<T2>10</T2> will not be exceeded. In the City of Camden and Jersey CityNJDEP will or has followed the following schedule for attainment demonstration:<ITAG tagnum="15">_May 1, 1985, PM</ITAG><T2>10</T2> monitoring started at the Morris-Delair Water Treatment Plant,Camden County.<ITAG tagnum="15">_December 31, 1988, monitoring period completed at the Camden site.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_March 31, 1989, attainment status determined for the Camden site.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_January 13, 1987, PM</ITAG><T2>10</T2> monitoring started at the Jersey City, Newark Avenue site.<ITAG tagnum="15">_March 30, 1990, attainment status determined for the Jersey Citysite.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_August 30, 1989, TSP and PM</ITAG><T2>10</T2> actual and allowable emissions data prepared for the JerseyCity and Camden areas.G. Group III AreasBased on monitored TSP data and some PM<T2>10</T2> data, the entire State of New Jersey, outside of the City ofCamden and Jersey City, is designated as Group III for PM<T2>10</T2>. As such, EPA believes that the existing TSP SIP is adequateto demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the PM<T2>10</T2> standard. The State of New Jersey, in its SIP revision, hascommitted to the monitoring and PSD requirements for Group III areas (seesections B and C of this notice). Any Group II or Group III area whichsubsequently observe violations of the PM<T2>10</T2> NAAQS will be treated as a newly discovered non-attainmentarea. Thus, the State will submit a full control strategy which demonstratesattainment of the PM<T2>10</T2> standard within three years.The following AQCRs and AQMAs are designated as Group III for PM<T2>10</T2> by EPA.<ITAG tagnum="15">_Parts of the New Jersey-New York-Connecticut AQCR:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_The City of Newark</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_The City of Elizabeth</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_The City of Linden</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_The Borough of Carteret</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_The Township of Woodbridge</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_The City of Perth Amboy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Parts of the Philadelphia AQCR (not including Camden)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_New Jersey Interstate AQCR</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Northeast Pennsylvania-Upper Delaware Valley Interstate AQCR</ITAG>H.Other Administrative RequirementsAs part of the public notification process, the State of New Jersey publisheda notice announcing the availability of the SIP revision in the New JerseyRegister on July 29, 1988 and requested comments.While EPA believes that the State did provide adequate opportunity forpublic comments, EPA regulations require the State to provide an opportunityfor a public hearing. Therefore, the State has been notified that theymust provide interested individuals an opportunity to comment and requesta public hearing if they have substantial negative comments concerningthe proposed approval of this SIP revision. These individuals would haveto request this public hearing in writing and provide the basis to supporttheir negative position.In addition, EPA is providing an opportunity to submit written commentson the proposed SIP revision to the address at the beginning of this notice.All comments shall be considered before a final rulemaking action is takenon this SIP revision.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; Revisionto Section 107 Attainment Status Designations for the State of New Jersey</ITAG>A. BackgroundSection 107(d) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7407(d), directs each stateto submit to the Administrator of the EPA a list of NAAQS attainment statusdesignations for all areas within the state. EPA received such designationsfrom the states and promulgated them on March 3, 1978 (43 FR 8962). Pursuantto 52 FR 24682 in the July 1, 1987 <T4>Federal Register</T4>, states are encouraged to request the redesignationof TSP nonattainment areas to unclassifiable at the time the PM<T2>10</T2> control strategy for the area is submitted. When EPA approvesthe control strategy as sufficient to attain and maintain the PM<T2>10</T2> NAAQS, it will also approve the redesignation. Since the Stateof New Jersey made revisions to the SIP for particulate matter that enablethe State to protect the NAAQS for particulate matter having a nominalaerodynamic diameter of 10 microns (PM<T2>10</T2>), EPA will redesignate TSP Primary or Secondary nonattainmentareas in the following AQCRs to unclassifiable:<ITAG tagnum="15">_New Jersey-New York-Connecticut Interstate AQCR:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_Hudson County</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_The City of Newark</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_The City of Elizabeth</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_The City of Linden</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_The Borough of Carteret</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_The Township of Woodbridge</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_The City of Perth Amboy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Metropolitan Philadelphia Interstate AQCR:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">_The City of Camden</ITAG>One significant result of EPA's rulemaking is that states will no longerbe required to subject major new and modified sources of particulate matterto the nonattainment requirements under Part D of the Clean Air Act. Thatis, because EPA is implementing the PM<T2>10</T2> NAAQS in accordance with section 110 of the Clean Air Act andwill not promulgate any attainment area designations (pursuant to section107 of the Clean Air Act) for PM<T2>10</T2>, the nonattainment area NSR requirements contained in paragraph(a) of section 51.165 will not apply to PM<T2>10</T2>. Furthermore, in light of EPA's delegation of the TSP indicatorfor the NAAQS, EPA no longer requires states to implement TSP nonattainmentarea NSR requirements based on Part D of the Clean Air Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion</ITAG>TSP concentrations in the State of New Jersey are predominantly influencedby combustion sources and motor vehicles. Combustion sources are controlledby State regulations through NJDEP's system while the State and FederalMotor Vehicle Control programs limit motor vehicle emissions. Since a largepercentage of the particles that are being controlled by these programshave emissions that are less than 10 microns, existing controls and strategiesare considered adequate for controlling and maintaining the PM<T2>10</T2> standard in New Jersey. Air quality has improved in JerseyCity after extinguishing the subsurface fires at the PJP Landfill and PM<T2>10</T2> air quality data indicates that this area as well as the Cityof Camden should attain and maintain the PM<T2>10</T2> standards without any new regulations.<ITAG tagnum="54">EPA is soliciting public comments on this notice and on issues relevantto EPA's proposed action. Comments will be considered before taking finalaction. Interested parties may participate in the federal rulemaking procedureby submitting written comments to the address at the beginning of thisnotice. </ITAG>The revisions are being processed under a procedure called ``parallel processing''(47 FR 27073). If the proposed revisions are substantially changed in theareas other than those identified in this notice, EPA will publish a revisednotice of proposed rulemaking. If no substantial changes are made otherthan those areas identified in this notice, EPA will publish a notice offinal rulemaking on the revisions. The final rulemaking action by EPA willoccur only after the SIP revisions have been adopted by the State of NewJersey and submitted to EPA for incorporation into the SIP. This notice is issued as required by section 110 of the Clean Air Act,as amended. The Administrator's decision regarding the approval of thisplan is based on its meeting the requirements of section 110 of the CleanAir Act, and 40 CFR Part 51. Under 5 U.S.C. Section 605(b), I certify thatthis SIP revision will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. (See 46 FR 8709) The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof Section 3 of Executive Order 12291. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 </ITAG>Air pollution control, particulate matter. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 81 </ITAG>Air pollution control, National Parks, Wilderness areas. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: June 29, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William J.
