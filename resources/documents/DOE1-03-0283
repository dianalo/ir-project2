<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-03-0283 </DOCNO><TEXT>Virtually every category of food substance contains trace levels of carcinogens.Whether they are traditional foods like grains, cheese, or mushrooms,spices like pepper or nutmeg, migrants from packaging materials, residuesfrom pesticides or animal drugs, or unavoidable impurities from additivesin processed foods; it is impossible to purge them completely. As ourawareness of the ubiquity of carcinogens has grown, there has been agrowing need to distinguish between tolerable and intolerable risk fromcarcinogens in food. This distinction, which relies inter alia on thetoxicological principle of dose-response, the essence of quantitativerisk assessment, is now regarded as crucial in the regulation of carcinogens,as it has been in the regulation of non-carcinogens. Early FDA policystatements and the food safety laws themselves contained the impliedpromise of absolute safety from carcinogens in food. To understand thecurrent role of carcinogen risk assessment in food safety policy, itsrelatively slow development, its conservative application, and the legaldifficulties that still bar its wider use, a review of some of the historyof the food laws in the US is provided. 24 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
