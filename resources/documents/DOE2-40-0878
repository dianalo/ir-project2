The document concernsthe technical aspects of ground-water monitoring at Resource Conservationand Recovery Act (RCRA) facilities. The Committee concluded that TEGDdocument that is reviewed was badly needed and represented a good startfor setting consistent standards for establishing and evaluating ground-water-monitoringefforts. The Committee concluded that the majority of the TEGD is technicallysound, and it made a number of recommendations for improvement that areincluded in the report. The Committee also suggested that the Agencyshould emphasize that the TEGD is neither a regulation nor an engineeringhandbook, and that flexibility, highly trained and experienced personnel,and professional judgment should be used by both EPA and those implementingground-water monitoring systems.</TEXT></DOC>
