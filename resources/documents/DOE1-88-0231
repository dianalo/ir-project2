The so-called ''Commission Castaing'',from the name of his chairman Pr. Castaing, a well known physicist, includedpersons from various professional backgrounds together with people incharge of these questions at the French Atomic Authority (Commissariata l'Energie Atomique, CEA). It was the first time in France that a Groupincluding independent people was officially entrusted with such a sensitivetask, normally dealt with inside the nuclear establishment. The 3 yearsexperience of the Castaing Commission and the comparison between thepresent situations concerning surface and underground disposal, showthe importance of external expertise in gaining public acceptance. Thesedays, it is not enough for the public to be positively informed by theoperators themselves; public opinion insists more and more on the importanceof a minimal agreement among scientists from various background on aproject which is marred by many uncertainties on long-term effects. Finallya certain separation of powers between the various institutional actorsis necessary: this would not decrease the competence of the entire system.On the opposite, the lack of input from the outside and the lack of internaldemocracy can condemn an institution to sterility, a possible sourceof mistakes and wrong decisions. This is one of the major lesson of theoriginal Castaing exercise.</TEXT></DOC>
