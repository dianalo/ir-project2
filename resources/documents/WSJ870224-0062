The largest penalty was a $300,000 fine against General Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. unit for alleged violations of capital and other rules at various times between 1982 and early 1986.    The Big Board also fined Sprague andamp; Nammack, a former member firm, $200,000; Henderson Brothers Inc., $100,000; Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., $50,000; Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, $20,000; Rose andamp; Co. Investment Brokers and Butcher andamp; Singer Inc., $10,000 each; and First Albany Corp. $5,000.    All eight consented to the Big Board's findings and penalties without admitting or denying guilt. The violations are alleged to have taken place at various times in the 1980s.    In the Kidder case, the Big Board also fined two individuals $25,000 -- John T. Roche, formerly executive vice president of the securities firm and now president of the firm's recently created holding company, Kidder Peabody Group Inc.; and Gerard Miller, the firm's former director of operations. Both settled without admitting or denying guilt.    The exchange charged that Kidder Peabody failed to properly supervise its business practices. Among other charges, the Big Board said Kidder improperly computed its net capital position, failed to properly maintain a reserve account for the benefit of customers, failed to gain proper control of securities fully owned by customers, and commingled customers' securities with its own as collateral for bank loans.    In settling the case, Kidder Peabody also agreed to have an outside review of some policies for handling customers' securities and to provide supplemental reviews of those procedures to the Big Board for two years.    In early 1986, Kidder settled without admitting guilt similar charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It agreed to hire outside auditors to monitor its compliance with the settlement, and agreed to file semiannual reports with the agency for two years. Kidder agreed to improve certain bookkeeping procedures and to maintain an accurate account of its safekeeping procedures for customer accounts. The settlement with the SEC involved a censure, but no fine.    The Big Board case comes while Kidder Peabody is reeling from its recent involvement in the government's widening insider trading case. While not charging the firm with wrongdoing, the government earlier this month charged three present and former Kidder Peabody executives with making millions of dollars in profits for the firm by trading on inside information. The Big Board's action isn't related to the government's case.    In a statement, Kidder said the Big Board case involved &quot;highly technical and complex&quot; aspects of its business. The firm said no customers were at risk as a result of the firm's actions, and that the firm didn't profit or attempt to profit from the alleged infractions.    Sprague andamp; Nammack, former Big Board specialists, or market makers, was charged with causing fictitious trades to be printed on the Big Board tape, thus improperly influencing the prices of certain stocks. In addition to penalties against the firm, Jerome W. Nammack Jr., a former general partner, consented to a fine of $60,000 and a six-month suspension from association with a member firm. After the suspension, he can't act as a specialist or supervise anyone acting as a specialist. Harold E. Mercil, another former general partner, consented to a $25,000 fine. The former Sprague officials couldn't be reached for comment.    Henderson Brothers, another specialist firm, was charged with trading in a listed stock in the over-the-counter market for the benefit of its own arbitrage account. Under exchange rules, members must execute such trades on the exchange. In addition, Alan M. Levine, a trader at the firm, consented to a $25,000 fine for executing the trade.    In New York, Henderson Brothers said, &quot;The incident was inadvertent and occasioned by a miscommunication in the application&quot; of a Big Board rule &quot;in a new area of our business.&quot;    Bear Stearns was fined on charges it failed to maintain at required levels its special reserve bank account for customers' benefit. Bear Stearns said in a statement that it &quot;inadvertantly violated a technical rule concerning the computation of special reserves.&quot; A spokeswoman added that the firm &quot;derived no benefit&quot; from the violation and &quot;no clients were prejudiced at any time.&quot;    Prudential-Bache was fined on charges it failed to report promptly certain events, such as the firing of stockbrokers. The firm also allegedly failed to include required details in certain reports to the exchange. Prudential-Bache said new procedures designed to prevent such violations have been in place for some time.    Chicago-based Rose andamp; Co. allegedly improperly removed customers' fully owned securities from a controlled location. The firm agreed to review its procedures for maintaining control of such securities. Rose officials couldn't be reached.    Philadelphia-based Butcher andamp; Singer was charged with inaccurately computing its reserve requirement and with failing to maintain properly its reserve account for the benefit of customers. Among other things, the firm also commingled customers' securities with its own as collateral for bank loans.    Butcher andamp; Singer called the violation a &quot;very clerical, careless mistake.&quot; Since the violation was discovered, &quot;There hasn't been a comparable violation,&quot; a spokesman said.    First Albany was charged with failing to maintain properly its special reserve account for customers. The firm said that the violations &quot;were primarily clerical&quot; and that &quot;we don't expect them to occur in the future.&quot;    Except for Sprague andamp; Nammack, all the firms also were charged with failing to properly supervise their business. </TEXT></DOC>
