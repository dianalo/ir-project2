The company said it would agree to most of the commission staff's proposals, but also requested a 1.2% rate increase in 18 months and a 0.8% rate increase in three years.    The company said it is willing to support the staff plan that proposed an immediate $19 million, or 5%, rate reduction. The staff also suggested the company exclude its investment in a nuclear power plant and a coal plant from its base utility rate. The utility then would be allowed to sell its excess nuclear and coal energy through a separate, unregulated marketing subsidiary.    PS of New Mexico would be able to include a portion of its coal-plant energy in the rate base over 10 years and would be allowed to reorganize as a holding company, a change the utility has been trying to make for two years.    The commission rejected the utility's initial request to form a holding company because it believed it wouldn't be able to fully examine the company's books.    PS of New Mexico then proposed splitting the company into a distribution segment that would be regulated by the state, and a generation and transmission company that would be regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The latest proposal wouldn't split up distribution and generation, and would keep the generation operations under state regulation.    PS of New Mexico said it has asked the commission, which must approve the plan, to consider its compromise at a regular meeting May 13. Hearings on the issue currently are scheduled for October.    PS of New Mexico's stock price closed unchanged at $16.75 a share yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
