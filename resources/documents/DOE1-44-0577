The results indicate that because of spin-exchangerelaxation, it is difficult to influence the nuclear polarization ofthe lower hyperfine states by means of ESR pumping. The model is appliedto the design of an ESR-operated beam source of spin-polarized atomichydrogen. We estimate that in our experiments the maximum flux of particlesejected from the source was 5 x 10/sup 13/ sec/sup -1/.</TEXT></DOC>
