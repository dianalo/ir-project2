Mr. Reagan, speaking to a group of business and investment executives at the White House, specifically noted that business leaders are unhappy over a proposed tax provision that would slow takeover activity. The provision is included in legislation already passed by the House that could serve as a basis for fleshing out the deficit-reduction package Congress and the White House agreed to last Friday.    Mr. Reagan didn't specifically threaten to veto a tax bill if the provision on takeovers is included. But he asserted: &quot;Just let me say that this agreement does not preclude us from vetoing any or all of the legislation that comes out of this agreement. And I will veto any bad tax bill.&quot;    The deficit-cutting agreement contains savings that negotiators say will total $30.2 billion for this fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, and $45.8 billion in the next fiscal year. It envisions increasing taxes $9 billion this year and generating $14 billion in new revenues next year. The precise taxes to be raised aren't specified in the agreement but will be worked out in congressional committees over the next few weeks.    Mr. Reagan's comments don't reflect any change in his interpretation of the deficit-reduction agreement. At the insistence of the White House, the plan specifically noted that the president could either sign or veto the specific taxes Congress chooses. And the administration has said before that it isn't happy with the provision on takeovers.    But by raising the threat of a tax-bill veto just three days after the deficit-cutting plan was announced, Mr. Reagan seemed intent on signaling lawmakers that he won't be a passive observer as the plan is implemented.    Mr. Reagan specifically mentioned the proposed tax provisions on mergers and acquisitions because they are believed to have contributed to market jitters before the Oct. 19 stock market crash. The tax bill passed by the House contains several provisions that would take away many tax breaks now used in takeovers. One provision that has caused the most controversy would deny a deduction for interest expense in a takeover exceeding $5 million.    House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) has said he would consider modifying that provision, especially because it would hit friendly as well as hostile takeovers. The Senate Finance Committee rejected tax provisions designed to slow merger and acquisition activity.    The president's remarks suggest the White House will be pressing hard for a change, and chances are good that the provision will be dropped in a House-Senate conference on the tax bill.    However, conferees are likely to accept another provision that would create a &quot;corporate raider&quot; tax on the &quot;greenmail&quot; gains from stock bought back at a premium from an unwanted suitor.    Mr. Reagan told the business and investment executives that he had received &quot;personal assurances&quot; from congressional leaders and the chairmen of congressional tax-writing committees that they won't exceed the ceilings of $9 billion in new taxes this year and $14 billion next. And, Mr. Reagan said, there won't be any change in marginal rates or indexing, or any new &quot;broad-based taxes, such as a sales tax or new excise taxes.&quot;    The president also said, as he did on Friday, that the agreement won't be &quot;the last word&quot; on reducing the federal budget deficit. &quot;We can and should do more,&quot; he asserted.    In response, John Phelan, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, who attended the meeting, told Mr. Reagan that the plan is &quot;much better&quot; than the $23 billion in automatic cuts that would have been implemented under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. If Congress and the White House had failed to reach an accord, he said, &quot;that certainly would be viewed in foreign markets and by foreign governments as an extremely serious situation.&quot;    The Gramm-Rudman cuts could still go into effect if Congress and the administration fail to agree on details and implementation of the package.    After the meeting with Mr. Reagan, Mr. Phelan and others who attended stressed that it is important for Congress to quickly pass legislation detailing and implementing the deficit-reduction plan.    Treasury Secretary James Baker is expected to try to parlay the plan into a new international agreement on currency stabilization and economic coordination among industrialized democracies. As Secretary Baker urges those countries to spur their economies and step up imports, the business leaders asserted, a quick agreement on deficit-reduction details will be important in helping him argue credibly that the U.S. is whittling down its deficit.    &quot;If we don't pass this legislation promptly, I think the signals that we would send, and the loss of standing and leverage (for) Jim Baker would have serious effects,&quot; said Peter G. Peterson, head of Blackstone Group and a former commerce secretary. </TEXT></DOC>
