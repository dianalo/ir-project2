Klein</HL><DATE>11/08/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12</SO><LP>   Chicago -- Charlie Finley was called a lot of thingsduring the 20 years he owned the Kansas City and OaklandAthletics, but asleep at the wheel was never one of them. Hewas the fella who brought white shoes and brightly coloreduniforms to baseball. Also the designated hitter and nightWorld Series and All Star games. He plumped for baseballs tobe bright orange, so people could see them better.   And he still had time to put together the A's teams thatwon consecutive World Series titles in 1972 through '74.Those were the best teams of the post-Yankee (after-1964)era, I think; they had better pitching than the 1975 and '76Cincinnati Reds.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I'll tell ya something else I did in baseball that fewothers did -- I made money every year I was in the game butone, and that included some pretty bad clubs as well as mygood ones,&quot; rasped the bushybrowed Charlie O. in his officehere the other day. &quot;I was sensible about what I paid myplayers even though some of 'em didn't appreciate it, and Ididn't do like a lot of the owners did, which was hire 100people to do the work of 10. Something needed to be done,often as not I'd do it myself.&quot;   Finley sold the A's in 1980 and now, at age 73, he'smostly doing what he did before he became a sports mogul,which is peddling insurance. He made his initial bundle bypioneering the sale of group insurance to organizations ofphysicians and other professionals. He has not, however,ceased thinking originally about the games people play, orturning his own hand to them. On this day, he sat twirlinghis latest brainchild, the Double Grip football. &quot;I'd say itwas the football of the future, but the future's startedalready,&quot; he declared.   The ball is being made by Rawlings Sporting Goods Co., butit's really Charlie's. It's his name and his design, which,like all great innovations, is simple. Instead of the tinyraised pebbles on the surface of the conventional football,those on the Double Grip are inverted, like the dimples ongolf balls. The intention is to make the ball easier tohandle.   &quot;I played high school football in Gary, Ind.,&quot; Finley saidby way of explanation. &quot;I wanted to play quarterback, but Ihad small hands and couldn't control the ball very well, sothey made me a guard. Guard was the worst position on theteam. I got all battered up and never got my name in thepaper.   &quot;I never thought much more about that until a couple yearsago,&quot; he went on. &quot;I keep sports stuff around my office, andwas fiddling with a football while I was talking to someguys. All of a sudden it occured to me: Who says the pebbleshave to stick up? Why can't they be inverted?   &quot;I called Rawlings and Wilson. Had 'em each make up$100,000 worth of footballs; paid for 'em myself. Then Icalled a bunch of coaches and asked 'em to give the ball atry. Just about all of 'em loved it. I got a patent and madea royalty deal with Rawlings. So there you have it.&quot;   Finley flipped me a ball. I remarked that it felt tacky.&quot;People always ask me if I put stickum on it. There's nothingon it; that's just how it feels,&quot; Charlie chortled. &quot;It'sgreat for throwing and catching. I've been told it playsgreat in the rain, too. Northwestern used it a couple weeksago against Illinois in a real downpour. They had noturnovers and pulled a big upset. The coach there calls ithis rain ball.&quot;   The Double Grip debuted last season and was used in eightcollege bowl games, among others. Some 30 college teams nowhave adopted it. Finley says he's dickering with severalmanufacturers to put the idea to work on basketballs. &quot;Hadsome made up and passed around, and you know who liked 'embest? The girls] Said it really helped 'em handle the ball.It'll be a winner.&quot;   Charlie tired of that subject and produced anotherfootball. This one sported fluorescent-yellow stripes alongits four seams as well as the inverted pebbles. The stripesare another of his ideas, and he has commercial plans forwhat he calls his High Visibility ball.   &quot;Did you know that 90% of high school football fields haveinadequate night lighting?&quot; he asked. &quot;Most schools play onFriday nights, which means that a lot of time the playerscan't see the ball, and the fans can't, either. With thisball, that'll be no problem. It's just such an obviously goodidea, it can't miss.   &quot;You know,&quot; he mused, &quot;I got into baseball as a fan, notan insider type, but I still did OK, and I've always thoughtthat if you gave the fans a say in running sports they'd be awhole lot better than they are. All the changes I proposed inbaseball were designed to make it better for the fan, and I'dhave done more if the mossbacks had let me.   &quot;Take the designated hitter; I pushed it through to helpcorrect the huge imbalance in favor of the defense that washurting the game, but it didn't go far enough. You've gotpitchers today who are 6-foot-6. They can throw 95 mph, andthey've got such long arms they can just about tickle abatter's mustache with their fingers after they let the ballgo. What chance does a hitter have?   &quot;If I had my way, they'd award walks after three balls,not four, so the pitchers'd have to come over the plate more.I proposed a designated runner who could enter a game threetimes without the players he replaced being eliminated.Wouldn't you rather see a really fast guy run the bases thansome big, heavy catcher or first baseman?   &quot;I took a lot of heat for my orange-baseball idea, but Istill like it, for the same reason as thefluorescent-stripped football: The fans and the players --especially the hitters -- will be able to see it better. Andthe story that baseball shot me down on that is untrue. Inever formally proposed it, because I never found a way tocolor a ball orange properly.   &quot;Baseballs aren't painted or dyed, you know; the cowhideturns white when its processed with something called alum,and there's no alum that can turn a ball orange. But lemmetell you, I've got people working on that. As soon as they'resuccessful, you'll hear from me again.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
