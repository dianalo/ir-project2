A Ministry of International Trade and Industry official said the prohibition, effective next Tuesday, followed the company's conviction in the Kobe district court on Oct. 27.    The court fined Tomei one million yen ($7,425) for illegally exporting signal generators and computers for plants making color television sets, and integrated circuits for electronic measuring equipment, between July 1984 and January 1986. The shipments were found to be in violation of rules of the Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, the multinational body that regulates exports to Communist countries.    Japan has stepped up its monitoring of such exports and provided for increased penalties since it was revealed earlier this year that a unit of Toshiba Corp. shipped milling machines to a Leningrad shipyard several years ago that U.S. officials believe helped the Soviets develop quieter submarines. </TEXT></DOC>
