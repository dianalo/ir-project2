At least two militiamen from the Israeli-backed South LebanonArmy were wounded in the 7:40 a.m. blast, which occurred justbefore the two-story administration building was to open for theday, police said.   The explosion at the Zumarraya crossing point into the zone, 1.8miles north of Hasbaya, leveled the building and destroyed a nearbyarmored personnel carrier, a police spokesman said.   After the blast, Israeli troops and their militia allies intanks and armored personnel carriers opened fire on Moslem villagesnorth of the security zone. There were no immediate reports ofcasualties, police said.   Guerrillas of the Democratic Front for the Liberation ofPalestine used a remote control device to detonate an estimated 110pounds of TNT at the four corners of the administration building,the police spokesman said.   Two guerrillas were arrested later a few miles north ofZumarraya, said the spokesman, who cannot be named under standingrules.   The Zumarraya crossing has been a flashpoint of tensions inrecent days over attempts by the Israeli-backed militiamen to opena recruitment office in the nearby Moslem hamlet of Shab'a,according to sources with the United Nations Interim Force InLebanon.   Shab'a residents are known to be sympathetic to Yasser Arafat'sPalestine Liberation Organization.   Since pulling out of Lebanon in 1985, Israeli troops havemaintained a buffer zone in south Lebanon to guard againstcross-border attacks into Israel by Palestinian and Lebaneseguerrillas. The six-to-10 mile deep security zone is policed by1,000 Israeli troops and 2,000 allied militiamen.</TEXT></DOC>
