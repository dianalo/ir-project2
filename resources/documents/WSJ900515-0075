It is a sight that hasn't been seen for more than acentury here, though great herds once roamed Maine.   The chalk-white stag looks healthy and alert. But the oddsare he will die soon.</LP><TEXT>   Caribou No. 630 -- for 159.630 megahertz, the signaturefrequency of a transmitter on his neck -- is an unwittingconscript in a grand plan to transplant this stately relativeof the reindeer from northern Canada back to its formerhabitat of Maine. But the four-year-old Maine Caribou Projectis stirring controversy and raising questions about who isbenefiting, since it doesn't seem to be the caribou.   Some of the three dozen or so animals that have beenreintroduced died right away from the trauma of capture,unable to survive being rounded up by helicopter, shot bytranquilizing darts and shipped 1,200 miles. More hardshipshave followed. Of the 12 released last year, 11 fell todisease or predators. So many perished that &quot;we had to stopnaming them&quot; and give them numbers instead, says MarkMcCullough, the project's biologist.   Backers also had to suspend the &quot;Adopt-a-Caribou&quot; program,a potent fund-raising technique for the privately financedproject, because the animals kept dying. Dandy, Davey,Natalie, Kathy and the eight other caribou released in 1989had been adopted by grade-school classes, garden clubs andbusinesses, which then got reports on their progress in thewild.   The schoolchildren learned a cruel lesson. Natalie wasmauled by a black bear. All that was left of Davey were a fewbones, gnawed clean. Dandy died in a rock slide, while Kathywas claimed by a stomach ulcer. Many others succumbed to aghastly parasite, a worm that slithers up the spinal cord andbores into the brain, driving the victim crazy before killingit. Even in the nursery pens for those bred in captivity atthe University of Maine, bottle-fed baby caribou -- doe-eyedstars of the local TV news -- were felled by viruses anddiarrhea.   The carnage has ignited an emotional debate in Maine overanimal rights and the wisdom of trying to fool Mother Nature.&quot;The whole thing has been a howling failure,&quot; declares LinnPulis, a member of the Maine Animal Coalition. She suggeststhe project was really undertaken for the benefit of humans,based on a self-centered, romantic notion of wilderness.&quot;It's certainly not being done for the caribou,&quot; she says.   The Humane Society of the U.S. calls it a &quot;disaster&quot; andhas asked Gov. John McKernan to suspend the project, whichneeds permits from the state wildlife commission. (He hasn'tyet responded.) Now public opinion, which strongly favoredthe project in its first three years, seems to be shifting aswell.   The project's stated scientific goal is to find outwhether caribou can inhabit their former range in Mainedespite the advance of white-tailed deer, carriers of thebrainworm parasite. But backers acknowledge that otherelements -- such as nostalgia, sentimentality and tourism --may be playing a part. &quot;The caribou is a tremendouslyimportant symbol of wilderness&quot; and a key part of Maine'sheritage, explains Thomas Urquhart, director of the MaineAudubon Society. The state map is dotted with Caribou Lakes,Caribou Mountains, Caribou Brooks and Caribou Bogs, not tomention the town of Caribou -- where one hasn't set hoof in ahundred years.   &quot;Part of the problem is that the caribou have lovely darkeyes, and people grow attached to them, and the media lovethem,&quot; says Mr. Urquhart, who serves on the board of theproject. The exposure helps draw donations, he concedes, &quot;butit obscures the fact that this is a science experiment, andexperiments don't always work.&quot;   Some skeptics, however, suspect that &quot;blood sport&quot; was thehidden motivation for the project. &quot;The object of the cariboucaper is to establish a modest supply of another big-gameanimal hunters can slaughter,&quot; charges Mike Brown, columnistfor some rural weekly newspapers.   Despite the mounting criticism, boosters aren't giving up.Twenty more animals were released last month, and plans callfor 25 more to be caught in Canada and released next year andanother 25 in 1992. The hope is that eventually caribou willfare as well as the puffin, the peregrine falcon and the wildturkey, all of which have been successfully reintroduced inMaine.   Mr. McCullough, the biologist, is philosophical about theharsh way nature has dealt with his experiment. &quot;Death ispart of what happens in the wild every day,&quot; he says. &quot;It'sthe hard reality that they never show on programs like `WildKingdom.'&quot; As for hunting, he strongly denies that one goalis to supply caribou for game. Hunting could occur only ifthere were someday so many that a short, restricted huntmight be needed to manage the herd, he says.   Mr. McCullough believes that man destroyed most of theoriginal caribou population and now has &quot;a moral obligationto undo the damage he has done.&quot; He has decorated his officewith a painting he did of a regal stag and its mate in theswirling mists atop Mount Katahdin. &quot;One day, we hope thatthis scene can again become a reality,&quot; he says.   But others think nature had the decisive role in thecaribou's departure from Maine. They wonder whether cariboucan live alongside deer, which aren't affected by the brainworm they carry. The parasite's complex life cycle begins indeer droppings and spreads in a larval stage to snails andslugs on the forest floor, which pass it back to deer -- orto an unlucky feeding caribou.   Historically the range of deer and caribou didn't overlap,says Arthur T. Bergerud, of the University of Victoria inBritish Columbia. He led the first effort to return caribouto Maine, in 1963, which failed. &quot;Caribou just can't sharetheir range with the white-tailed deer,&quot; he says. Where theyappear to do so, as on Quebec's Gaspe Peninsula, caribou anddeer are in fact separated by altitude and feeding habits, hesays.   Mr. Bergerud believes the caribou left Maine largelybecause shifting climate cycles allowed deer to migratenorthward. Other scientists think caribou left after loggingreduced the old forests to scrub and new-growth woods, whichdeer prefer. All agree that heavy hunting also played a role.   Whatever the reason for their disappearance, manyofficials in both Canada and Maine think it's worth findingout whether caribou can live here now. Maine's wildlifecommissioner, William Vail, says the caribou project shouldbe allowed to continue at least one more season.   The biologists &quot;have done an outstanding job,&quot; he says.&quot;It's a tough issue politically and socially. Some peoplethink its terribly cruel to take them from the wild andtransplant them. But it's science, and we think it deservesanother chance.&quot;   Kevin Noyce, a mechanic at the Irving gasoline station inthe tiny northern Maine town of Patten, agrees. &quot;Lots ofpeople think they're wasting their time, and a lot of money,but I think it's worth a try,&quot; he says. &quot;If caribou arerunning around the forest again 50 years from now it'll seemlike it was a pretty good idea.&quot;   However, Mr. Noyce is less enthusiastic about anotherreintroduction effort recently proposed by federal officials.&quot;Now, ask me about timber wolves,&quot; he says, &quot;and you'll get adifferent answer.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
