The Dearborn, Mich., auto maker said that if the sensor sticks, the engine might idle roughly or too fast, or might run poorly or stumble when the transmission is shifted into the drive position.    A spokesman said Ford isn't aware of any accidents or injuries related to this problem. Ford will notify owners by mail to return the cars to their dealers for a free replacement of the defective sensor. </TEXT></DOC>
