Sullivan Faces Deadline on WhetherTo Push Companies to Leave South Africa---By Dennis KnealeStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AFRIC </IN><TEXT>   For the Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, decision time is nigh.    For a decade, the Baptist minister has used his Philadelphia pulpit and his seat on the General Motors Corp. board to cajole businesses into embracing his Sullivan Principles, a code of fair-employment tenets for U.S. companies in South Africa. Two years ago, Mr. Sullivan began warning that if apartheid wasn't abolished by May 31, 1987, he would push for economic sanctions and a mass corporate exodus.    Now the deadline is here. Mr. Sullivan has scheduled a news conference next Wednesday in Washington to announce whether he will follow through on his threat. Caught between pressure from antiapartheid activists urging him to keep his word and from U.S. companies asking him to back off, Mr. Sullivan appears to be waffling. &quot;I honestly haven't decided,&quot; what to do, he says, &quot;and the good Lord hasn't quite told me yet.&quot;    Whichever course he takes, the impact may be dramatic. A call to exit would probably trigger new corporate departures and raise the pressure on companies that stay behind. It could severely damage the code's credibility and weaken the position of companies that say they can help force change only by staying in South Africa. Already, companies are scrambling to figure out ways to continue the principles without their founder.    &quot;It really pulls the moral rug out from underneath their feet,&quot; says Timothy Smith of the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility, who is expecting a call for a pullout. &quot;For many companies, Sullivan's announcement will be the straw that breaks the camel's back.&quot;    It also could mean a big portfolio selloff. Mr. Sullivan says he has lined up pledges from pension funds and universities to sell more than $80 billion in equities of U.S. companies in South Africa if he advocates a pullout.    If Mr. Sullivan extends the deadline he risks losing face. His principles -- which have been signed by 110 of the 199 U.S. companies operating in South Africa -- are already under fire as ineffective, and the criticism may increase if he is seen as acquiescing to corporate pressure. Antiapartheid activists say an extension would also hurt their efforts. Some corporate executives agree that extending the date for, say, a year won't work. They say that Mr. Sullivan needs a longer-term view, and that the principles were wrongly billed as a way to end apartheid from the first.    Randall Robinson of TransAfrica, a Washington lobbying group, says the principles &quot;have done more harm than good; they've given corporations an excuse for remaining. I can only hope he will keep his word and call for total corporate disengagement.&quot;    Adds Kenneth Zinn of the United Mine Workers of America, which has been pressing companies to leave: &quot;Rev. Sullivan will have to follow through on his deadline, or his word won't mean anything in the future.&quot;    The pressure to do just that is becoming even greater. Last week the South African government refused to issue Mr. Sullivan a visitor's visa, and it recently threatened to take action against companies' efforts to help black workers move into whites-only areas.    So far this year, 18 U.S. companies have left South Africa, including International Business Machines Corp., Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber Co. and CPC International Inc.; 15 others are in the process of getting out, including Xerox Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co. That compares with 50 withdrawals in 1986 and 40 the year before, says the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a Washington nonprofit group.    The prospect of a call for a pullout, however, bothers some companies. &quot;The principles have fallen short of the ideal, clearly, but the record is pretty impressive,&quot; says William D. Broderick of Ford Motor Co.    In 1986, the Sullivan report shows companies spent about $38 million on education, housing, health and &quot;social justice.&quot; That works out to $842 per person for the roughly 45,000 blacks employed by U.S. companies -- but only $1.50 for each of the country's 25 million blacks. Still, the 1986 spending rate was more than double the annual rate of the previous 10 years.    Few companies say they would automatically heed a call to leave by Mr. Sullivan. Some are said to be organizing quiet petition drives among black South Africans urging Mr. Sullivan to keep plying the principles. They also are planning how to continue the Sullivan Principles without Mr. Sullivan. Some are looking for a new leader for the movement and casting about for new approaches, whether he calls for an exodus or not.    &quot;We will do Sullivan without Rev. Sullivan, because we think it's the right thing to do,&quot; says Sal G. Marzullo, a Mobil Corp. executive speaking as chairman of a group of Sullivan-signee companies known as the Industry Support Unit. He nonetheless hopes Mr. Sullivan will extend the deadline. Merck andamp; Co., one of the few other companies willing to talk publicly, says it would review its presence but wouldn't leave South Africa automatically.    One alternative gaining support, says consultant Clay Westcott of Cambridge, Mass., is the Ikwezi Trust, a foundation that would be formed by South African blacks and perhaps funded by U.S. firms to give blacks a stake in local subsidiaries of American companies.    Still, a call for an exodus by Mr. Sullivan would increase the &quot;hassle factor&quot; of staying. South Africa provides less than 1% of most companies' business yet consumes a huge amount of time as they defend their presence. Thus many companies might finally give up. Mr. Smith of the Interfaith group says several major companies are concerned that Mr. Sullivan may call for an exit and are planning how they will get out if he does.    All of which must be weighed by Mr. Sullivan, who knew his deadline was short -- and would be difficult to meet. &quot;South Africa doesn't have 10 years, or five years, or four years to free its black population before there is massive conflagration,&quot; he wrote two years ago.    Now companies await his decision. &quot;What do you do?&quot; Mr. Sullivan says. &quot;Everyone says give it time, give it time. Somewhere there are people who must take&quot; a stand. </TEXT></DOC>
