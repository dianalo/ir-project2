(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Subaru of America announced Friday itwill voluntarily recall 15,000 Justy four-wheel-drive vehiclesbecause of transmission fluid problems that can cause the rearwheels to lock.   The vehicles subject to recall are those manufactured for the1988 and 1989 model years before March 10, 1989, said spokesmanSteve Davis.   Insufficient levels of transmission fluid may result because ofincorrect fluid level prescribed by Subaru, the checking proceduredescribed in the owner's manual and the design of the fluiddipstick, Davis said.   Low fluid level can cause ball bearing seizure and possiblerear-wheel lockup, he said.   ``There were a few cars where customers had rear-wheel lockupbecause of the bearing seizure,'' Davis said. ``No accidents or anybodily injuries were associated with that, just mechanical damage.   ``We're bringing these cars in and actually raising the level offluid in the transmission,'' Davis said.   In addition, a modified dipstick will be installed and an insertfor the owner's manual describing correct transmission fluidchecking procedures will be provided at no cost to the owner, hesaid.   All affected owners will be notified by mail, the company said.   The problem does not affect the two-wheel drive Justy, Davis said.</TEXT></DOC>
