Adrian had sought the abstract of bidsreceived in a procurement action. The DOE found that the Albuquerque OperationsOffice had correctly withheld portions of the abstract pursuant to Exemption4 of the FOIA, because the release of the material could cause the submittingfirms a competitive disadvantage by allowing their competitors to predicttheir likely pricing behavior in future procurements. The DOE rejectedAdrian's contention that a provision of the Federal Acquisition Regulations,which required that abstracts of bids be made public, mandated the releaseof the abstract in this case. The DOE noted that the present procurementinvolved a subcontract between a DOE contractor and a third party to whichthe Federal Acquisition Regulations do not apply. Accordingly, this claimwas rejected, and the Appeal was denied.<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>The Albuquerque Journal, 7/25/89, KFA-0303</T3>The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying a Freedom of Information Act(FOIA) Appeal filed by The Albuquerque Journal.
