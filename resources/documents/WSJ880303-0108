Wrong, I'm afraid. These days the Pulitzer-predators, swollen with self-importance like cows in June, tell David to stop acting irresponsibly and tip their hats to Goliath.    Take first the case of the Anderson Valley Advertiser, a blow-dried congressman called Doug Bosco and the infinitely prestigious and prodigiously pompous Des Moines Register.    The Anderson Valley Advertiser is published weekly out of Boonville, a small town in northern California, and edited by a very large man called Bruce Anderson, who takes as his journalistic brief the p4 recipe, for which he has been rewarded with the enmity of the forces of power and darkness as duly constituted in Mendocino County. Mr. Anderson, in short, offers the real Prairie Home Companion. He's Garrison Keillor for people with brains.    The Advertiser is everything a local paper should be. It covers the school district and the police blotter. It harasses the lumber companies, broad-rumped bureaucrats, Nike-shod liberals and other enemies of the human spirit. It also runs a column by the present writer, which of course in no way diminishes the objectivity of the foregoing observations.    One of the many people the Advertiser does not care for is young Rep. Bosco, now in his third term as representative from the Redwood Empire. What agitates many of Rep. Bosco's constituents is that he is fence-straddling on one of the hottest issues in northern California today, namely off-shore drilling. The possibility that oil rigs may one day soon rise from the ocean floor of Mendocino and Humboldt counties is one that tempts many locals in the direction of armed struggle. They noted that Rep. Bosco preferred to caper about Iowa at Rep. Richard Gephardt's elbow rather than participate in public hearings by the Interior Department at the start of February.    Rep. Bosco failed to show Feb. 1 for the hearings in Fort Bragg, and in its edition for Feb. 3 the Advertiser struck back. The strike took the form of a purported interview between Rep. Bosco and one &quot;David Yesson&quot; of the Des Moines Register. Now it did not take unusual mental candlepower to see that the interview was a put-on. It had Rep. Bosco saying about those of his constituents opposed to oil drilling, &quot;They're mostly a bunch of stirred-up, know-nothing malcontents who couldn't care less about anything other than their beautiful ocean and where their next joint is coming from.&quot;    These are not the words blow-dried congressmen are programmed to say under any conditions, even in a supposedly &quot;off the record&quot; interview conducted in the Des Moines City Grille by &quot;Yesson.&quot; The citizens of Boonville chuckled at the satire and turned the page to Sheriff's Log and &quot;Crime of the Week.&quot;    This indulgence did not extend to the offices of the congressman, where aides received 200 calls from irate voters howling for Rep. Bosco's blood. Rep. Bosco issued furious denials and threats to sue.    For a while Mr. Anderson kept the put-on in play, stunned at the squadrons of allegedly alert journalists down the West Coast who earnestly interviewed him about the interview's authenticity. But after a few days he confirmed the hoax, invoking the great tradition of Mark Twain and William Randolph Hearst.    Twain and Hearst are fortunate not to be living at this hour. The next thing that happened to Mr. Anderson is that he lost his printer, receiving a one-sentence letter from Thomas W. Reeves, general manager of the Ukiah Daily Journal, stating that &quot;The Journal will no longer print the Anderson Valley Advertiser after March 10, 1988.&quot; The Journal is part of the Donrey Media Group, which has been serving the cause of free expression down the years with considerable lack of distinction.    Mr. Anderson took some pompous heat in Mendocino County, but such abuse was nothing compared with the bellowing from Iowa. In early February, the Des Moines Register was at the climax of its quadrennial spasm of self-importance as the journal of influence during the caucuses; no one in its newsroom was more inflated with grandeur than a political correspondent called David Yepsen, whose name Mr. Anderson had echoed with &quot;Yesson.&quot;    From Mr. Yepson came strophes of indignation about &quot;irresponsibility&quot; and the threat to free speech posed by the put-on, and from James Gannon, editor of the Des Moines Register came something more extraordinary: a legal challenge from Goliath to David, stating -- in a lawyer-inspired letter published in the Advertiser for Feb. 24 -- that the satire &quot;substantially interferes with Mr. Yepsen's credibility as a writer and undermines the trust he has built up over the years with potential subjects of his reporting. . . . &quot; The article,&quot; Mr. Gannon claimed, &quot;further defames both Mr. Yepsen and the Des Moines Register by characterizing Mr. Yepsen's interview as caustic and demeaning to Congressman Bosco.&quot;    The honor of these Pulitzer-predators will be vindicated only if Mr. Anderson does all sorts of demeaning acts pursuant to article 48a of the Civil Code of California, mostly in the order of eating humble pie. Mr. Anderson says no.    Now, briefly, for a similar tale of untrammeled Goliathry, as first recorded in the newsletter Moore's Weekly, published out of Washington, D.C., by my friend Michael Moore, dedicated to &quot;publishing the censored news of the week.&quot; Mr. Moore reports that on Jan. 5 he was on hand at the Waldorf Astoria ballroom in New York to film the opening press conference of a three-day, $20 million General Motors extravaganza. With him was Russell Mokhiber, editor of the Washington-based Corporate Crime Reporter, and a longtime critic of GM. Mr. Mokhiber also contributes to Multinational Monitor, the monthly founded by Ralph Nader.    Mr. Moore, his crew and Mr. Mokhiber were issued press credentials by a GM public-relations person. Twenty minutes later, security personnel approached Mr. Mokhiber and asked him to leave. He pointed to the valid credentials hanging round his neck and refused. The GM goons thereupon seized Mr. Mokhiber's chair and carried him bodily from the room, down to the hotel's security office, whither the NYPD was summoned. Mr. Mokhiber was handcuffed, driven to the 18th precinct and charged with criminal trespass. He was arraigned yesterday. GM's media-relations director Jim Crellin says there was ambiguity about Mr. Mokhiber's credentials and since he would not cooperate with GM's inquiries he was removed.    While Mr. Mokhiber was being carried out he appealed to the 200 reporters and photographers present to take note of this pre-emptive censorship. None of the newshawks lifted a finger to mar the propriety of GM's stage-managed bash. One cable-TV crew and a photographer from the Detroit News thought to record the episode and a UPI reporter later called Mr. Mokhiber for a story eventually picked up by four newspapers. So much for David in his war with Goliath. &quot;He's related to Nader,&quot; the security goons told Mr. Moore, &quot;and we've had to deal with him before.&quot;    ---   Mr. Cockburn is a columnist for The Nation. </TEXT></DOC>
