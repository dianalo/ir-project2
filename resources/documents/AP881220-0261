A spokesman for Warner Communications Inc. confirmed Tuesday thatthe corporation's music publishing division has signed an agreementto buy Birchtree Ltd., the Princeton, N.J. publishing company thatowns the birthday song.   The spokesman, Geoffrey Holmes, refused to disclose the price ofthe deal, but the New York Times reported Warner Chappell had agreedto pay $25 million for Birchtree.   ``I wouldn't have put that number on it,'' Holmes said, notingthat Birchtree has been valued at an estimated $12 million to $15million. But he would not say the Times' account was wrong.   Holmes said the sale would be completed next month. It will giveWarner Chappell the rights to the song until the year 2010, when thecopyright expires.   Altogether, Birchtree owns 50,000 titles, of which about 1,700are actively collecting royalty fees. Warner Chappell, the world'slargest music publisher, already owns the rights to songs by Georgeand Ira Gershwin, Michael Jackson and Cole Porter, among others.   ``Happy Birthday,'' which is said to generate about $1 million inroyalties, is one of the three most popular songs in the Englishlanguage, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Theothers are ``Auld Lang Syne'' and ``For He's a Jolly Good Fellow.''   The song began as a classroom greeting _ ``Good Morning to You''_ that was written in 1893 by two Louisville, Ky., kindergarten andSunday school teachers, Patty Smith Hill and her sister, Mildred J.Hill.   The birthday lyrics were written later and the song was notcopyrighted until 1935.   Birchtree was put up for sale in October, in part because thecompany said it did not have the resources to monitor and protectits copyrights as larger companies do, according to the Times.</TEXT></DOC>
