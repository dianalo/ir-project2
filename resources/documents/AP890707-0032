The announcement Thursday by President Bush marks a reversal forthe United States, which has preferred only to stretch out repaymentterms for debtor nations.   ``Beginning Oct. 1 the U.S. government will forgive officialdevelopment loans in the sub-Saharan countries,'' the president tolda news conference.   In 1987, the most recent year in which figures were immediatelyavailable, the State Department put the total of U.S. loans tosub-Saharan Africa at $4.3 billion, including $743 million indevelopment loans, $1.5 billion from the U.S. government'sExport-Import Bank and $1.2 billion in U.S. government loans to buysurplus American farm products.   Bush did not say which of these categories would be included.   Africa south of the Sahara Desert is usually taken to mean all ofAfrica except South Africa and the North African countries on theMediterranean _ Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco.   Bush said his action would be in accordance with a decision madelast year in Toronto at an economic summit of industrializeddemocracies to offer different options to creditor governments.   Other governments, notably West Germany, France, the Netherlandsand the Nordic countries, have converted many loans into grants.Loans have become the preferred form of U.S. aid, but as Third Worlddebt has mounted and the burden of interest payments on debtorcountries increased, the pendulum has swung back to grants.   In 1987, sub-Saharan Africa owed $137.8 billion in medium- andlong-term debt. It was estimated that payments due from thesecountries had risen from $5.6 billion in 1979 to $21 billion a yearfor the period 1986 to 1989.   Total Third World debt is put at about $1.3 trillion.</TEXT></DOC>
