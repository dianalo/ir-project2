In a report in the July 12 issue of the American Chemical Society journal Biochemistry, the company said it has successfully duplicated a natural protein, found in berries of certain West African plants, that is 5,000 times sweeter than sugar. Because the protein is so concentrated, only small amounts with few calories are needed to sweeten foods. Difficulty in harvesting the berries has limited large-scale commercial production of the natural protein, thaumatin.    Under a product development program funded by Chicago-based Beatrice Cos., International Genetic Engeneering has been working for several years to genetically engineer the protein in common baker's yeast. Beatrice, a food products concern, earlier this year renewed its agreement with the company for an additional $1.4 million.    The companies still have to conduct tests to determine how well the engineered protein works as a sweetener in food products. Arup Sen, vice president of International Genetic Engineering, said that even if tests are successful, it would probably be two to three years before the product could be marketed.    Beatrice has world-wide rights to thaumatin produced by International Genetic Engineering. The world-wide market for low-calorie sugar substitutes is well in excess of $1 billion annually, International Genetic Engineering said. </TEXT></DOC>
