Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said more similar raids by themilitiamen could be expected.   Israeli television said the South Lebanon Army destroyed about60 houses in the village of Maydoun, which Israeli officials saidwas used as a base by the radical Shiite Moslem militia Hezbollah,or Party of God.   Israeli troops seized about 20 suspected guerrillas and broughtthem back to Israel during the two-day thrust into Lebanon thatended Wednesday, Israeli sources said on condition of anonymity.   Israel said at least 40 guerrillas were killed in the operation,most of them Hezbollah members killed Wednesday in Maydoun, twomiles north of Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in southernLebanon.   Two of the three Israeli soldiers killed in the assault wereburied Thursday.   Sheik Subhi Tofeili, a Hezbollah leader, said only 10 of hisguerrillas were killed. He also said the Hezbollah would avenge theattack.   ``We shall retaliate. The battle with Israel is still in itsinitial stage,'' he told a news conference in Mashgara, four milesnorth of Maydoun. ``The torch of resistance will continue to burndespite Israel's attacks.''   Lebanon protested the raid and requested an urgent meeting ofthe U.N. Security Council to condemn the operation. U.N. officialssaid the 15-member council likely would meet Friday.   Lebanese Ambassador Rachid Fakhoury, in a letter made publicThursday, said the Lebanese government holds Israel, the SecurityCouncil and the United Nations ``responsible for this fresh act ofaggression.''   According to Lebanese reports, Israeli soldiers blew up homesand bunkers in Maydoun after the fighting ended and used bulldozersto bury the rubble and the bodies of the dead guerrillas.   Israel radio and television reported that South Lebanon Armyreturned Thursday to destroy more homes, apparently almost all thatremained after the attack.   Israeli officials said the mission's aim was to halt escalatingguerrilla attacks against Israel soldiers and their Christianallies.   ``(Our) activity cannot only be defensive,'' Rabin said onIsrael radio. ``From time to time we must initiate action againstthe terrorist bases that operate against us.''   The security zone, a 6-to-10 mile wide strip north of theIsraeli border, was designated as a buffer zone after Israel endedits three-year occupation of south Lebanon in June 1985.   ``Israel will have to keep up its offensive operations,'' thedaily Haaretz quoted Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, commander of Israeliforces in the north, as saying. ``If you don't take the offensive,you may save some lives in the short run. But six or seven monthslater, the number of casualties could be inestimably higher.''   Haaretz quoted unnamed military officials as saying Israel wouldforfeit its success at Maydoun unless it continued to take theinitiative in its war with the guerrillas.   Martin Kramer, a specialist on the Hezbollah at Tel AvivUniversity, said the Shiite fundamentalist organization is Israel'simplacable enemy.   ``They want to destroy Israel,'' Kramer said on Israel radio.   But some critics questioned the wisdom of the attack on Maydoun,noting that the Hezbollah had not taken part in any of the dozeninfiltration attempts by guerrilla groups since November.   ``Why Hezbollah?'' asked military analyst Uzi Mahanaimi in afront-page commentary in the Yediot Ahronot daily. ``Hezbollah isnot the Israeli army's main enemy in south Lebanon and hasn't triedto penetrate into northern Israel.''</TEXT></DOC>
