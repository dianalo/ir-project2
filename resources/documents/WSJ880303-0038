The dollar jumped in early afternoon trading in Europe yesterday after a Japanese wire service reported that an unidentified senior U.S. official said: &quot;At the very minimum, the (dollar's) upper range would be consistent with the upper range in the previous Louvre agreement.&quot;    In February 1987, the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Italy -- the so-called Group of Seven major industrial nations -- agreed to stabilize the dollar after it had fallen significantly for nearly two years. Traders said they estimated the agreement's upper range at 1.90 West German marks to the dollar and 160 yen to the dollar.    The Louvre agreement was reaffirmed in late December. According to the Japanese wire service, the U.S. official added that in December, &quot;there was a strong feeling that the dollar would have considerable room to appreciate before it got to levels that threatened&quot; the continued improvement in U.S. trade figures.    He reportedly added: &quot;If the U.S. trade deficit continued to improve, there would be continued acceptance of the appreciation of the dollar.&quot;    The Japanese report was accompanied by other reports that Washington would have no problem with the U.S. currency climbing another 8% to 140 yen. The reports &quot;triggered a wave of short-covering in both the U.S. and Europe,&quot; said Jeff Mondschein, vice president and manager of corporate foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch International. At one point yesterday, the dollar traded as high as 1.6980 marks and 129.60 yen before retreating.    &quot;There's a question of whether the (trade) deficits have really narrowed at all,&quot; said Richard Witten, a vice president at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;It's probably true that they've stopped expanding, but it's not at all clear that they've begun narrowing in dollar terms -- even though they have in volume terms.&quot;    He said the &quot;comment was soft news, not hard news.&quot; Nonetheless, Mr. Witten noted that the &quot;market was ready to try the upside, having tried the downside for the past week.&quot;    In late New York trading the U.S. currency stood at 129.38 yen and 1.6965 West German marks, up from 128.40 yen and 1.6875 marks Tuesday. Meanwhile, the British pound fell to $1.7673 from $1.7760 the day before.    In midmorning trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted at 129.10 yen.    Traders said the pound's fall against the dollar was tempered by West German central bank president Karl Otto Poehl's comments that a recession currently poses a greater danger for the West German economy than inflation. In addition, currency markets still perceive Britain's economy as a relatively strong one, despite Monday's news that the country's merchandise trade deficit had widened to a record 1.51 billion pounds ($2.67 billion) in January, said Mr. Witten.    When dealers bought pounds and sold marks on the pessimistic warning by Mr. Poehl, the dollar rose slightly against the West German currency. That's because in such cross-rate transactions the dollar is used as a medium of exchange. In other words, traders would first sell marks for dollars, then sell dollars for pounds.    Traders said the Bank of England was rumored to have intervened, selling pounds and buying marks to keep the British currency from climbing above 3.0 marks. As is its practice, the central bank declined to comment. But for about a year, the British government has maintained a policy of trying to keep sterling below 3.0 marks to keep British industry competitive with continental Europe. Late in New York, sterling stood at 2.9985 marks.    Mr. Witten of Goldman Sachs said the dollar could inch up to 1.70 to 1.71 marks and 130 to 130.50 yen. But he warned that traders would hesitate to take large dollar positions before U.S. trade data for January are released in two weeks.    &quot;Does the springtime bring out the bears in three weeks, or is this the bottoming out, which means we won't see new lows?&quot; asked Mr. Mondschein of Merrill Lynch. &quot;A lot will hinge on the trade figures.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $430.80 an ounce, down 20 cents. Volume was moderate at 3.2 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $431.35 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Wednesday, March 2, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
