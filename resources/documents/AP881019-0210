Johann Deisenhofer, a Dallas-based researcher, and West Germancolleagues Robert Huber and Hartmut Michel won the Nobel Prize inchemistry for work done in Germany to determine the structure ofcertain proteins needed in photosynthesis.   Michel, 42, was visiting Yale University's medical school in NewHaven, Conn., when he learned he had been selected by the Nobelawarding committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.   ``Actually, I was starting to tremble. I had my coffee in myhand. I had to put it away.'' Later, he delivered a scheduledlecture to an audience whose members were not surprised their guesthad become a Nobel recipient, said Yale professor Donald Engelman.   Deisenhofer, 45, said he was in the shower when the phone rang,and was ``really upset'' until he learned that it was a call toNobel fame.   ``I am not a quick starter in the morning. It took me about anhour to really be sure that this was not a dream,'' he said   Americans Leon Lederman, Melvin Schwartz and Jack Steinbergerwon the Nobel Prize in physics for research conducted at ColumbiaUniversity in 1961 into the subatomic particle called a neutrino.   The award announcement said the work ``opened entirely newopportunities for research into the innermost structure anddynamics of matter.''   The research has ``no practical significance other than verylong term,'' said Schwartz, head of Digital Pathways Inc., inMountain View, Calif. ``If you understand something better, sooneror later it will be practical.''   ``Someday some kid who is now in high school will find out howto use this information to bring benefits to all of society,'' saidLederman, 66, director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratoryin Batavia, Ill.   With hopes of encouraging young people to get interested inscience, Lederman is giving up his job as head of the government'satom smashing laboratory to take a teaching position at theUniversity of Chicago.   University spokesman Larry Arbeiter said Lederman would in Marchbegin teaching not only graduate students in physics, but alsoundergraduate science students and liberal arts majors.   ``It's unusual for somebody of his stature to be teaching peopleso early in their careers _ and even people who aren't scientistsat all,'' Arbeiter said. ``He's a very articulate, energetic manand he's the perfect person to get people interested in science.''   ``Science is a tremendous career to follow,'' Lederman said.   ``You have fun all the time _ some blood, sweat and tears too,but it is ultimately rewarding,'' he said.   Each Nobel Prize carries a $390,000 award. None of the winnersannounced any immediate plans for spending the money.   Schwartz, a 55-year-old former Stanford University professor,founded Digital Pathways in the 1970s as ``an attempt toparticipate in all the excitement of Silicon Valley.'' He said thefirm deals with data communications in the security field, buildingcomputer systems with an ability ``to keep hackers out.''   Steinberger, 67, a German-born American citizen, is a physicistat the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or CERN, inGeneva, Switzerland.</TEXT></DOC>
