Later this year, a not-for-profit foundation based inHanover, N.H., plans to introduce video programs designed tohelp patients choose treatments for four common ailments:benign prostate disease, low back pain, high blood pressureand early-stage breast cancer. Using a combination ofscientific data and candid patient interviews, theinteractive videos will offer viewers detailed descriptionsof the risks and benefits of treatments ranging frommonitoring symptoms to surgery.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The goal is to educate patients as much as possible abouttheir condition and encourage their participation in thetreatment decision,&quot; says Dr. Michael J. Barry, director ofpreventive care at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston,and a member of the medical team that is developing theprograms for the Foundation for Informed Medical DecisionMaking.   Researchers believe such information will prove a boon notonly to individual patients but also to the nation's troubledhealth-care system. It would start to infuse a health-caremarket dominated by the preferences of doctors and othersuppliers of care with the kind of consumer power that drivesother industries.   &quot;We're shifting the environment from one where doctorschoose the treatment to one in which patients make thechoice,&quot; says Dr. John E. Wennberg, professor of communityand family medicine at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center inHanover, who devised the interactive video project. &quot;We'rebeginning to democratize the doctor-patient relationship.&quot;   Other approaches are aimed at the same goal. At the HealthInstitute at New England Medical Center in Boston, SherrieKaplan and her colleagues are coaching patients in waitingrooms just before their 15-minute sessions with theirdoctors. &quot;Most of us don't prepare ourselves for that visit,&quot;she says. One result: On average, patients ask fewer thanfour questions during a doctor's appointment. Dr. Kaplan'sresearch shows that patients who are coached to focus onissues they want to raise are much more assertive.   John Ware, another researcher at New England MedicalCenter, has developed with colleagues there and at RandCorp., a Santa Monica, Calif., think tank, a shortquestionnaire that yields a score indicating a patient'sfunctional status. When it's filled out just before adoctor's visit, it can help both patient and physician focusnot only, say, on whether medication has lowered bloodpressure but also whether a patient's overall well-being hasimproved.   Early experience with the videos indicates that theresults of such efforts can be profound. At Kaiser PermanenteMedical Group in Denver, the rate of prostate surgery amongits members plunged 44% in the first year after doctors beganshowing patients the prostate video in a pilot projectinvolving more than 250 patients. At Group Health of PugetSound, a health maintenance organization in Seattle, surgeryrates initially fell 60%.   No wonder that health insurers as well as HMOs like Kaiserand Group Health figure the videos may be a powerful weaponin reducing unnecessary surgery and other procedures. &quot;We'dlike to see this approach on as broad a scale as possible asquickly as possible,&quot; says Frank Greaney, executive vicepresident, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Hampshire.   The idea for the videos grew out of Dr. Wennberg'sresearch into variation in medical practice. He and hiscolleagues found, for instance, that more than three quartersof the elderly men in one Maine town had undergone prostatesurgery, compared with less than a quarter of the men thesame age in an adjacent town.   Similar variations exist across a wide spectrum, fromtreatment of childhood ear infections to coronary arterydisease, and they reflect a lack of consensus over the bestway to treat many common illnesses. The differences alsosuggest that patients treated with the most aggressive -- andusually most expensive -- remedies often don't fare anybetter than those treated conservatively. In such cases, Dr.Wennberg believes, patient rather than physician preferenceshould drive the decision.   It's an idea grounded in common sense but fraught withchallenges. Doctors, especially surgeons, are trained to makedecisions and take aggressive action in the interest of theirpatients. And many doctors believe they should presentoptions personally, not use high-tech gadgetry.   Doctors working in a traditional setting might also resistprograms that could steer patients away from surgery. Whenthe prostate video program was installed in a practice inIowa where doctors were often paid on a fee-for-servicebasis, few patients were urged to watch it. &quot;It was fareasier to do this project at an HMO with salaried physicianswho don't have an economic {stake in} surgery,&quot; says Dr. PaulBarrett, associate medical director of Kaiser Permanente'sColorado region, who oversees the pilot project there.   To surmount such hurdles, the foundation plans todisseminate the videos, and the computer hardware needed torun them, only in doctors offices or hospitals, so thatpatients can discuss their reactions with their doctors. &quot;Thevideos aren't endrunning the doctors,&quot; says Mass General'sDr. Barry.   And the researchers are taking pains to provide balancedpresentations. For instance, a prostate video features apatient who underwent surgery to relieve painful urinaryblockages and is thrilled with the results. Another patient,who rejected surgery in favor of a choice Dr. Wennberg calls&quot;watchful waiting,&quot; says he's satisfied even though he has totake care to get aisle seats when he goes to the theater. Theprogram also frankly describes possible complications fromsurgery that can result in incontinence or impotence.   After Jack Anderson, a 60-year-old retired scienceteacher, saw the video at the Kaiser health plan in Denver,he decided against surgery, at least for now, despiteoccasional blockages and other symptoms. &quot;The video confirmedeverything,&quot; says Mr. Anderson, who wasn't eager to have anoperation. &quot;After seeing the pros and cons, I feel good aboutwhat I'm doing.&quot;   Harlan Gordon, 68 years old, of Arvada, Colo., wassuffering severe symptoms when he viewed the video, he says,and &quot;I saw that `watchful waiting' wasn't going to cure it,so I opted for the operation.&quot;   Whether the sharp reduction in surgery rates in theinitial tests will be maintained isn't certain. Many men whoput off surgery may ultimately want it. And once the video --which currently describes only surgery and watchful waiting-- is updated to include drugs and other procedures, patientswho would normally resist surgery might try an intermediateapproach.   Videos for back pain, blood pressure and breast cancer arenearly ready for testing. Meantime, others for hysterectomy,cardiovascular disease, arthritis, prostate cancer andcataract removal are among those on the drawing boards.   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Hampshire is consideringreimbursing doctors up to $50 anytime they refer a patient toview a program. The national Blue Cross and Blue ShieldAssociation may recommend the videos as an alternative tosecond opinions. And Joseph Kasper, president of the Hanoverfoundation, says some large companies are considering showingthe videos at work sites under the supervision of a companyphysician.   Supporters of the video programs see two other majoradvantages. Even doctors who were initially skeptical of theidea have come to recognize their value in providinginformation to patients in a comprehensive and unbiased way.&quot;Some doctors have a reluctance or an inability to explain&quot;information well, says Richard Loya, another Denver patientwho viewed the program and opted against surgery. &quot;This was avery professional presentation, and I don't think the doctorwould have been as effective.&quot;   Which leads to patient satisfaction, an important asset inhotly competitive health-care markets. &quot;Even if rates hadn'tgone down,&quot; says Dr. Edward Wagner, medical director at GroupHealth of Puget Sound, &quot;patient reaction is so positive, wewould still consider using it.&quot;   ---                    Informing Patients                                                                                                          Here are the options discussed in videos produced by theFoundation for Informed Medical Decision Making in Hanover,N.H.
