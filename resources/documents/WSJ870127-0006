Like many of their bigger brethren, smaller companies respond to lower inflation rates by reducing pay increases. Management raises at Hamburger Hamlets Inc. were 5% to 6% in 1986, down from 6% to 8% the year before. Sheldon Razin, chairman of Quality Systems Inc., Tustin, Calif., says inflation &quot;didn't push us to be aggressive with salaries&quot; this year.    The slumping farm economy hammers Dickey-John Corp., an Auburn, Ill., farm-equipment maker, whose top executives haven't had a pay raise for two years. Hard times in the troubled oil industry hit the new president of Offshore Logistics Inc., Lafayette, La.; he makes about $100,000 less a year than his predecessor. Houston's American Exploration Co. cut top officers' pay last year by 25%.    Pay raises for top management in 119 smaller companies dropped to an average 6% last year, down from 8% in 1985, says a Hewitt Associates survey.    FLEXIBLE HOURS help a hospital counter a national nursing shortage.    About 90% of 200 nurses at Children's Hospital at Stanford, Calif., work anything but a 40-hour week. Some work a portion of the year with certain months off; others set their own schedules, working 16 to 40 hours a week. One contracts to work nine months a year, then spends three months as a cruise-ship nurse. Another takes off days to run a tour business in San Francisco.    With more professions open to women, nursing has seen &quot;a drop-off not only in numbers but quality,&quot; says Carol Bradshaw, the hospital's nursing director. The flexible schedule &quot;helps us recruit and retain&quot; nurses without resorting to pricey personnel agencies and recruiting techniques such as cash bonuses, she says.    INCENTIVE PLANS spur safe work habits, reducing accidents at some plants.    Boston Gas Co. employees who didn't have an industrial or automotive accident for a month were eligible for lottery drawings last year. Winners got $25 catalogue gifts. The company says 1986 was its safest year in a decade for industrial accidents. Companies spend about $33,000 each a year on incentives to boost job safety, reward longtime employees and achieve other goals, says Personnel Journal.    Virginia Electric andamp; Power Co. employees can win from $50 to over $1,000 for safe work habits. Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. gave gift coupons to 2,000 employees who spent substantial working time driving without an accident last year. Its accident rate has been cut &quot;substantially&quot; during the two-year program.    Turner Corp., a New York engineering and construction firm, gives employees company stock if they meet safety goals.    BOARDROOM WOMEN: The majority of women named outside directors during 1986 had previous board service, says a survey by Heidrick Partners, an executive search firm. It was the first time experienced women directors were a majority in the survey's four-year history.    JOB-SAFETY RECORDS are kept fraudulently by IBP Inc.'s Dakota City, Neb., beef-packing plant, charges the Food and Commercial Workers union. The Labor Department reviews the complaint for possible action; IBP denies the charge. More than 2,000 workers are locked out of the plant in a contract dispute.    PROPER PENALTY? Employees at a home for mentally retarded adults near Montreal are ordered by a government-appointed council to pay one day's wages to a nonprofit association for the retarded as a penalty for a three-day, illegal strike at the home. Their union challenges the order.    FEDERAL JOB TRAINING helped 68% of dislocated workers who completed the program get employment during the year ended June 1986. The Labor Department, which administers the Job Training Partnership Act plan, also says that 60% of those who finished job training for the economically disadvantaged got jobs.    RATING OF TEACHERS gets poor marks in Texas.    Now halfway through its first year, the Texas Teacher Appraisal System was devised to help teachers climb a &quot;career-ladder&quot; merit plan. The state's 175,000 teachers are scored on an exhaustive written self-appraisal and on their performance during four, 45-minute observation sessions a year. A top evaluation can mean an extra $2,000 a year added to salary.    But teachers gripe about difficulty in scoring well enough during observations to earn top marks, and they say appraisers often aren't versed in the evaluated subject. &quot;It's a mess,&quot; says a teachers' group spokeswoman. Even the state education agency concedes the program needs fine-tuning. It will propose changes to satisfy some complaints.    A language teacher didn't get top ratings for a class conducted in Spanish because neither appraiser was fluent in Spanish, claims a teachers' group.    THE CHECKOFF: &quot;In Search of an Excellent Boss&quot; is a management course taught at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. . . . Teamsters president Jackie Presser successfully underwent surgery to remove &quot;an isolated tumor on his lung,&quot; the union reports. . . . Job seekers should shun Phoenix, Miami, San Diego and San Antonio because they have lots of retirees or those completing military service seeking jobs there, says Challenger, Gray andamp; Christmas Inc., Chicago consultant. </TEXT></DOC>
