<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-07-0820 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the well-consolidated sedimentary section at Conoco's Borehole TestFacility, the sandstones have a much higher Vs/Vp ratio than other commonlithologies. Because of this is it possible to directly detect potentialsandstone reservoir rock with P and S seismic data. This has a clearapplication in the search for stratigraphically trapped oil. Sandstonebodies in the subsurface can be located by comparing measured Vs/Vp ratiosfrom surface seismic data with computed ratios from a reasonable geologicmodel of the target interval. The geologic model, constrained with nearbywells, defines the expected style of lithologic variation within thetarget zone and reasonable averages for the P and S velocities of eachof the lithologies in the target interval. Given this calibration information,measured Vs/Vp can discriminate potential drill sites with a high percentageof sandstone from drill sites with a low percentage of sandstone, thusincreasing the likelihood of encountering the elusive reservoir sandstones.</TEXT></DOC>
