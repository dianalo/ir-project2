(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Violence marred a special holiday called byUnited Mine Workers to restore calm to the strike-scarred mines, andUMW President Richard Trumka sought to reassure a big Japanese coalbuyer.   Miners ambushed security men at dawn Monday at a non-union minein Boomer, 35 miles southeast of Charleston, injuring severalguards. An explosion damaged an office trailer in Virginia, and ashooting incident was reported in Alabama.   Trumka, who has asked union miners east of the Mississippi tostay off the job Monday through Wednesday, met in New York withEishiro Saito, president of the Nippon Steel Corp. and head of amajor Japanese business group.   ``We expressed to them that we are a stable supplier of coalworldwide,'' Trumka said.   The Westmoreland Coal Co., based in Philadelphia, announced thatit was falling short on orders of 308,176 tons promised to sevenforeign clients because of production wildcat strikes that idled itsmines. The company said it would be unable to fill additional exportorders for 165,865 tons unless mining resumed by the end of the week.   Trumka said he was opposed to strike-related violence, but didnot specifically refer to Monday's episodes.   ``Too often, miners have been the recipients of violence,'' hesaid.   More than 30,000 UMW members have been on wildcat strikesthroughout Appalachia and the Midwest for the past month in supportof 1,900 union members striking since April 5 against The PittstonCo. in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.   In the worst violence Monday, about 150 people ambushed a groupof security men at the entrance to the non-union Boomer mine, ownedby Appalachian Mining Inc.   Shots rang out, and several guards who scuffled with theattackers suffered minor injuries, said Cliff Nuckols, head ofNuckols and Associates Security Inc., of Cincinnati.   ``It was pitch black. The whole thing happened within 30-40seconds,'' he said.   State police said they were investigating.   Judge Paul Zakaib told the manager of a motel in nearby Dunbar onMonday that he could not evict Nuckols'company, which uses 30 roomsat the hotel as a base for guarding non-union mines in the coalfields.   Dunbar Travelodge manager Mike Mowry said picketing UMW memberswere driving away potential customers.   In Virginia, a federal judge ordered three men jailed, one forthree months and the others for one month each, for using convoys toblock routes to the mines.   It was the first time jail sentences had been issued for thetactic, which has been used widely by the UMW since the Pittstonstrike began.   U.S. District Judge Glen Williams had complained last week thathuge fines levied against the union were ineffective in keeping themfrom using the tactic.   In other violence:   _Police said two trucks and a car were overturned and severalsecurity personnel suffered minor injuries when strikers confrontednon-union miners at an operation in Fayette County, southeast ofCharleston. Troopers made one arrest for destruction of property.   _Two coal trucks were hit by gunshots near the Black Pearl Mineat Prenter, about 30 miles south of Charleston.   _Four non-union Gandamp;W trucks at Jasper, Ala., were struck bybullets, the Walker County Sheriff's Department said. No injurieswere reported, and no arrests were made, authorities said.   _In Dickenson County, Virginia, an explosion damaged an officetrailer owned by Clinchfield Coal Co., Pittston's main subsidiary inthe state, police said.</TEXT></DOC>
