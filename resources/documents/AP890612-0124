Airlift Brings Namibian Refugees Home</HEAD><BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Nations began one of its mostambitious repatriation operations Monday, bringing hundreds ofNamibian exiles home to participate in the territory's independenceprocess.   The first plane arriving at the Windhoek airport from Lusaka,Zambia, brought about 150 refugees, including adults who have livedabroad for more than a decade and children who set foot on Namibiansoil for the first time.   The U.N. High Commission for Refugees sought to repatriate morethan 1,300 refugees on 11 flights Monday, but several flights werecanceled after delays and only about 700 refugees returned,officials said.   ``They are all in very good health and they are all very happy,''said Nicolas Bwakira, the U.N. official in charge of the airlift,who greeted the first batch of returnees.   The United Nations has registered 41,000 Namibian refugees atcamps in neighboring Angola, Zambia and Botswana. The world bodywants to bring back more than 1,000 refugees a day for the next sixweeks under the independence plan for Africa's last colony, whichhas been ruled by South Africa for 74 years.   In addition to the airlift, hundreds of refugees have crossed theborder from Angola on foot, Namibian officials said.   The returning refugees were greeted at the airport by about 250demonstrators wearing the red, blue and green colors of theSouth-West Africa People's Organization guerrilla movement.   SWAPO fought a 23-year bush war with the South African securityforces and now is the most powerful political faction in Namibia.   The demonstrators included women who sang and men who chantedpro-SWAPO slogans. They held up signs that pictured SWAPO leader SamNujoma and read, ``Welcome Home SWAPO Freedom Fighters.''   U.N. troops from Kenya kept the crowd behind ropes as therefugees went through customs and boarded buses for the 30-mile tripto the Doebra Refugee Camp outside Windhoek.   A tent city was built as temporary shelter for the refugees onthe grounds of a Roman Catholic mission. Buses carrying the firstgroup of refugees were met by about 400 students from the missionschool.   The students sang and danced outside the compound where therefugees lined up to receive ration cards and blankets from U.N.workers.   U.N. officials have said they expect the refugees to leave thecamp and join relatives within a week.   Another demonstration took place at a busy highway intersectionat the camp entrance. About 15 members of the Parents Committee ofNamibia held up signs demanding SWAPO account for more than 100people who joined the organization but have not been heard from.   ``SWAPO, Where Is My Son?'' said a sign held by a man who addedthat his 18-year-old son left to join the organization eight yearsago and has not been heard from since.   The Parents Committee and other organizations have charged thatSWAPO dissidents were kept prisoner and beaten or executed if theytried to leave the movement.   SWAPO has said it released 200 dissidents and denies that itkilled any disenchanted members. SWAPO has said many of thedissidents were South African spies.   Under the U.N. independence plan, Namibian elections are set forNovember. The polls are to establish a constituent assembly, whichwould then set up a black majority government. About 94 percent ofthe territory's 1.3 million people are black.   SWAPO is expected to win the most votes, but it is unclear ifthey will be able to capture the two-thirds majority needed tocontrol the government.   Under a regional peace treaty signed in December, South Africaagreed to relinquish control of Namibia in return for Cubawithdrawing its estimated 50,000 troops from Angola. The Cubansfought alongside government forces in their battle againstU.S.-backed rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
