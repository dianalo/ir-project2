Levine and Ivan F. Boesky, the Manhattan federal prosecutor is taking such a case before a jury.    It's not a big case in terms of money, though the accused, Israel G. Grossman, is a former lawyer at the well-regarded New York law firm of Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin andamp; Frankel. There are no ties to Messrs. Levine or Boesky, and the alleged insider scheme as outlined by the government is hardly very sophisticated.    Nonetheless, on Monday morning, when U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani sends the chief of his criminal division into court for the start of the Israel Grossman case, it'll be the first time since 1985 that his office will have to prove a criminal insider case in court.    Mr. Grossman, a 34-year-old attorney and father of five, is charged with leaking -- through more than 40 phone calls made from his office and tracked by Kramer Levin -- advance word of Colt Industries Inc.'s 1986 recapitalization plan to six people, most of them relatives. Members of the group allegedly made $1.5 million in illegal trading profits when Colt's stock price shot up. The others have been accused in a pending civil Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit.    Yesterday, a federal grand jury handed up a revised indictment charging Mr. Grossman with 38 felony counts; he was originally indicted on 24 counts.    Kramer Levin had been retained by the pension-plan trustees of Colt, a New York-based industrial products company.    Because most insider defendants reach plea agreements with the government, Mr. Giuliani's office hasn't had to prove an insider case in court since Thomas C. Reed, a former member of President Reagan's National Security Council staff, was acquitted of insider trading in Amax Inc. options in late 1985.    Like the Reed case, the Grossman case is based, at least from public disclosures so far, almost entirely on phone records that allegedly suggest that confidential, nonpublic information was disclosed. &quot;The (Grossman) case is essentially a circumstantial evidence case,&quot; Howard Wilson, chief of the criminal division in Mr. Giuliani's office, said at a May 28 pretrial hearing.    Yesterday Mr. Wilson declined to comment on evidence to be used in the case.    Unlike other cases with cooperating witnesses, the alleged Grossman accomplices all denied to the government that they got stock data from Mr. Grossman.    The Grossman case wasn't supposed to be the first recent criminal insider-trading trial. But a case involving three top Wall Street arbitragers has been delayed, and another big insider trial Mr. Wilson is handling has been put off until October. &quot;We're actually going to have one,&quot; Mr. Wilson chuckled yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
