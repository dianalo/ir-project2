First the President rallied worldwide economic sanctions,primarily a boycott of Iraqi oil and a freezing of Iraqiassets. He moved from there to gain U.N. support for amilitary blockade of Iraqi ports. He obtained Saudi Arabia'sacquiescence for the dispatch of U.S. forces to that country,something the Saudis had never before been willing to allow.Then he began moving air, naval and ground forces to theregion. Yesterday, he went on TV to give a calm explanationof all this to the American people and the world. Tomorrow,Secretary of State James Baker will visit U.S. NATO allies inEurope to plot further strategy.</LP><TEXT>   NATO cooperation is already unfolding. Britain offered airand naval forces yesterday after a cabinet meeting. WestGerman law prohibits out-of-country use of German forces, butBonn yesterday said the U.S. could use German bases forsupporting the Gulf action. Italy, a country that has farstronger naval forces than most people know, seems likely tohave a part in the deployments, though it has made nospecific commitments. Turkey, a NATO member, has been visitedby U.S. F-111s that are technically on an &quot;exercise&quot; but alsohappen to be within easy striking distance of Iraq. Even theSaudi air force, equipped with the best planes oil moneycould buy, is not nothing.   &quot;I have told our brothers in Iraq, I am afraid that Iraqwill be struck by a harsh strike from the outside. Don'tthink that the fleets are just going to sit there sleeping,&quot;Egyptian Presidnet Hosni Mubarak said in an addressyesterday. This warning to Saddam Hussein should not beoverlooked even though President Mubarak denied reports fromWashington that he has committed Egyptian forces to the Bushdeployments. He would prefer an all-Arab force, but surelymust know it is too late for that. Having watched his bossAbdel Nasser overreach himself against Israel 23 years ago,Mr. Mubarak wants an immediate Arab summit to try to talkHussein out of his madness.   For once deployments are in place, with or withoutEgyptian troops, Saddam Hussein will face a multinationalforce with enormous destructive power. Constructing anoverwhelming force would take several weeks, but by then itwould guarantee, if necessary, a short and decisive conquestof Iraq. Saddam's missile batteries could be taken out, andhis air force destroyed. With no air cover in a desertregion, his tanks and armored personnel carriers would be ashooting gallery for allied pilots. Meanwhile, his arms sitin the hot desert sun, waiting.   If Saddam launches a pre-emptive strike of his own, thatwill make things messier, but will have little bearing on thefinal outcome. The other thing would be capitulation, but thecapitulation probably would have to be total, most likelyincluding disarmament and the installation of a new, moderateleadership in Iraq. This, and not some mushy compromise, iscertainly the appropriate object of the efforts now beingexpended by President Bush and the whole NATO alliance.   The task, however, would not end with Saddam Hussein. Theallied forces will be in position to take steps to ensurethat there are no further crises of this type in the PersianGulf. That will entail a permanent force of some power in theregion.   It would also mean that all Mideast governments will beheld to higher standards of behavior than has been the casein the past. Syria, which allows radicals to play hostagegames with the West on territory that is nominally under itscontrol, will want to reconsider its position. Iran'sRafsanjani will have a new reason to press for arapprochement with the West. Libya's Gadhafi will findhimself very lonely. Little King Hussein of Jordan, whodecided at the wrong time to hold Saddam Hussein's coat, hassome rapid calculating to do.   The boldness of Mr. Bush and the West means, in short,that the world changed suddenly a few months ago and Arabdictators missed the signal. Their big friend, the SovietUnion, lost a Cold War and suddenly has become desperate forWestern economic aid. It can no longer offer much help to itsMiddle East &quot;clients.&quot; Saddam blustered that, without theSoviets, he would have a free hand. On present course, he nowis learning that just the opposite is true.   A great opportunity has dropped into the laps of GeorgeBush and his NATO allies, in short, an opportunity to pacifyone of the world's most troublesome regions. The President isapproaching that opportunity in a systematic way. It seemsunlikely that he will let it slip through his fingers.</TEXT></DOC>
