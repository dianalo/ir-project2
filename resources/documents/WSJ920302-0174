The new methods are still drawing skepticism from Congressand Wall Street.</LP><TEXT>   The goal of the new effort is to keep performing loans --those on which borrowers are making payments -- in banks foras long as possible, rather than quickly terminating many ofthem as in the past. &quot;Liquidating performing assets runs ourcosts up unnecessarily and damages the local economy prettybadly,&quot; says FDIC Chairman William Taylor.   In particular, the FDIC is structuring takeovers of failedbanks so that credit isn't immediately cut off to borrowerswho are paying interest monthly, although their ability torepay the loan upon maturity is in doubt. Most of theseso-called &quot;performing-nonperforming loans&quot; are real-estateloans that borrowers will find it difficult to replacebecause the value of the underlying collateral has declined.   In Texas and New England and other areas hit by bankfailures, businesses and politicians have complained thatFDIC policies encouraged buyers of failed banks to callperforming-nonperforming loans. In many cases borrowers hadto default and go out of business because they couldn'trefinance.   So, recently, when the FDIC took over CrossLand Savingsafter the agency couldn't get acceptable bids for the failedBrooklyn bank, the corporation installed a new chairman andinstructed him to collect as much as possible on defaultedcommercial real-estate loans, to restructure other loans ifnecessary, and shrink CrossLand down to a core business ofresidential real-estate lending. When CrossLand failed it haddeposits of $5.5 billion and assets of $7.4 billion.   The FDIC hopes to sell CrossLand within a year or two,recovering at least $400 million of the $1.2 billion it putinto the bank in January. The agency estimated that it wouldhave lost $1.2 billion or more by selling the bank's depositsand then liquidating the performing assets, rather thankeeping them in a functioning bank.   The agency also has moved to slow the sale of assets ofthe former Bank of New England and required the purchaser ofanother failed savings bank to work with troubled borrowersbefore disposing of the loans. In addition, the FDIC istelling banks and investor groups that it is willing to helpthem finance the takeover of failed banks. It recentlypurchased some preferred stock from Emigrant Savings Bank tohelp the bank raise the capital to acquire Dollar Dry DockBank, a failed savings bank based in White Plains, N.Y.   But banking committees in the House and the Senate haveasked the General Accounting Office to investigate theCrossLand and Bank of New England moves. Chairman HenryGonzalez (D., Texas) of the House Banking Committee worriesthat the new methods will increase, rather than decrease, thecost of dealing with failed banks. He says he sees efforts tolook for easy ways out of the savings-and-loan crisis &quot;as acontinuation of an activity that has been disastrous for thetaxpayer.&quot;   And some Wall Street analysts criticize the FDIC'sdecision to take over CrossLand, charging that thenationalization will lead only to greater losses. &quot;Look atthe bet they're making,&quot; says Gerard Smith, a managingpartner at Salomon Brothers. &quot;They're saying, `We'll takeover this enormous portfolio of real estate and run it untilthings get better.'&quot;   Harrison Young, the FDIC official who orchestratestakeovers of failed banks, responds that CrossLand &quot;isbasically a pretty good bank with a good deposit franchisethat made some very bad commercial loans.&quot;   More than 1,000 banks have failed in the past six years,and the FDIC expects 200 more banks to fail this year. Thebank deposit insurance fund, which is collected from banks,is so low that Congress has given it a new line of Treasurycredit.   &quot;If you can keep the assets in the banking system and havea banker working them, the chances of collecting at a higherrate are greater,&quot; Mr. Taylor argues. It doesn't make sense,he adds, to sell at a discount a performing mortgage thatyields more than you can otherwise get.   He says that putting loans into liquidation reduces theirvalue by about 25%. &quot;What drives a CrossLand strategy is thecost differential&quot; between a loss of 25% from liquidation anda loss of about 15% through arrangements that keep assets ina bank as long as possible while attempts are made to solvethe problems, Mr. Taylor explains.   Last month, the FDIC took several steps to slow theliquidation of $1.7 billion of performing-nonperforming loansthat Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc. took over from theBank of New England, and encouraged Fleet and other banks torefinance and even enlarge some of those loans.   The FDIC acted after receiving loud complaints from theNew England congressional delegation. The time of the change,which came just before the New Hampshire primary, generatedcharges that the FDIC bent to political pressure. &quot;Ourefforts to get the White House to look at this werefrustrated until the president's poll numbers went down,&quot;says Rep. Barney Frank (D., Mass.). &quot;That's calleddemocracy.&quot;   Mr. Taylor, who has headed the FDIC since November, saysthat any suggestion that the change was politically motivatedis &quot;shameful&quot; and potentially damaging to the agency. He saysthe new policies represent a growing conviction that &quot;massiveliquidations in weak economies doesn't serve the publicinterest.&quot; He stresses that the agency is prepared toconsider alternatives to liquidation in other parts of thecountry as well.   Mr. Young, a former investment banker, spends most of histime looking for ways to structure bank takeovers so thatthey'll cost the FDIC as little as possible. &quot;We have toexperiment,&quot; he says. &quot;When somebody says, `Hey, this isinconsistent with what you did before,' to a degree ouranswer is, `I hope so.'&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
