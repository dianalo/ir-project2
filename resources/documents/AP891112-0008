Rebelssaid they targeted President Alfredo Cristiani's official residence.   Gunfire, explosions and sirens could be heard throughout thecity Saturday night.   ``There are many people wounded by bullets and explosives but wehave not gathered complete information because we have not beenable to evacuate the wounded, the combat is so intense,'' a RedCross spokesman said on condition of anonymity.   Three Red Cross ambulances were either shot at or hit in thecrossfire, a spokesman for the group said. Two rescuers wereinjured when bullets hit the tires of one ambulance and itoverturned, he said.   An Associated Press photographer said he saw about 30 peoplewounded at the government's Rosales Hospital.   An employee of the armed forces press office, speaking bytelephone on condition of anonymity, reported ``attackseverywhere'' but could not confirm their exact locations.   Residents said they heard rifle fire near the homes of Cristianiand Ricardo Alvarenga, president of the legislative assembly, andthe rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos claimed attacks on bothhouses. The official presidential residence was also attacked, itsaid.   It was not immediately known whether the leaders were injured inthe attacks. But according to civilian sources, the attack onAlvarenga's residence left at least one guerrilla dead and at twosecurity guards wounded.   The attacks came three days after the Farabundo Marti NationalLiberation Front promised to intensify its decade-old insurgencyagainst the U.S.-backed government, in which more than 70,000people have been killed.   Radio stations said rebels attacked installations of the armedforces joint chiefs of staff and military positions in the city ofSanta Tecla, west of the capital. Also reported hit were army orsecurity force installations in the San Salvador neighborhoods ofMejicanos, Zacamil, Soyapango, Miramonte, Miralvalle, Montebello,the National University and the Catholic University.   Some radio reports said four civilians were wounded inMejicanos. They also said attacks were launched on the easterncities of San Miguel and Usulutaan, but military officials couldnot confirm it.   The first guerrilla attack came Saturday morning when guerrillaslaunched six homemade mortars at the barracks in northern SanSalvador, said Col. Carlos Carrillo, director of the NationalGuard. He said one struck the installation, injuring three soldiers.   Another mortar landed in a poor neighborhood, killing twochildren and injuring five civilians, Carrillo said.   He said the mortars had been placed in three vehicles at thebarracks' perimeter but technicians deactivated one before itexploded.   ``The attack was a demonstration of their (the rebels')inefficiency. If they had planned it well, all of their shots wouldhave fallen inside the installations,'' Carrillo said.   However, witnesses said one explosive hit a truck in thebarracks and injured 10 soldiers.   Carrillo said the rebel front was probably behind the attack.The rebels did not claim responsibility.   Guerrilla leaders said last week that they planned to intensifytheir attacks in El Salvador. The guerrillas attacked anothermilitary barracks Oct. 30, killing one person and injuring 15people.   Rebel leader claim that Cristiani is not interested innegotiating a solution to the conflict. They also blame hisrightist government for the Oct. 31 bombing of a union headquartersin San Salvador that killed 10 people and injured more than 30.   Recent peace talks between the government and the guerrillafront have not moved any closer to ending the war.</TEXT></DOC>
