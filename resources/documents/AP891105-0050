The newspaper said the report will go to Lord Fraser, the LordAdvocate, Scotland's senior law officer who is supervising thepolice investigation into the Dec. 21 bombing over Lockerbie,Scotland.   Fraser issued a statement on Sunday calling on news media toexercise restraint in their reports lest they ``seriouslyjeopardize'' the international criminal investigation and anyfuture court proceedings.   Authorities have not said when the report on the investigationwill be released.   ``Our essential purpose is put at risk if premature disclosureshuts off lines of inquiry or puts potenial witnesses underthreat,'' he said, adding, ``I have also noted considerableill-informed and inaccurate speculation in relation to the federalGerman police ... and other international agencies.''   Some details in The Sunday Times story have been reportedpreviously, but the newspaper, quoting unnamed Western intelligenceand security sources, now claims to trace the bomb from itsmanufacture to its placement aboard the flight.   It said Western intelligence agencies are convinced Iran paidAhmed Jibril, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine-General Command, to bomb Flight 103 as revenge for theshooting down of an Iranian airliner by an American warship lastyear.   The newspaper said Jibril ordered his top aide, Hafez KassemDalkamoni, to set up the bombing team and that Dalkamoni recruitedMarwan Khreesat, a 44-year-old Jordanian, to make the bomb.   The radical Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine-General Command often has been identified as the primesuspect in the Flight 103 bombing. In a U.S. television interviewin April, Jibril denied his organization had a role in the attackthat killed all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.   The Sunday Times alleged Khreesat assembled the bomb inFrankfurt and that it was then concealed in a radio-cassette playerand smuggled to the Mediterranean island of Malta by a Palestiniannamed Ramzi Diab, also known as Salah Fiaz Kwieks.   Khreesat and Diab were both arrested by West German police inraids in October 1988, but released.   Fraser said Sunday that the head of the British investigativeteam, Chief Constable George Esson, could not substantiate reportsabout unaccompanied luggage traveling from Malta to Frankfurt,``let alone unaccompanied baggage with a bomb in it.''   The Sunday Times said West German police suspected Khreesat ofbeing a terrorist bomb-maker but freed him for lack of evidence,even though he was being sought for two bombings of civilianaircraft in the early 1970s and police had found in his car abarometric or altitude-sensitive bomb of the type used on Flight103.   In Malta, Diab gave the bomb to a Palestinian cell operating inthe resort town of Sliema, the newspaper said. It said Dalkamoniand Abu Talb, another Palestinian, traveled to Malta and instructedthe cell to put the bomb on board an Air Malta flight to Frankfurtwhere Flight 103 originated.   The passengers and baggage transferred to a larger Boeing 747during a stopover at London's Heathrow Airport to continue the NewYork-bound flight.   Talb is currently in custody in Uppsala, Sweden, awaitingseparate bomb charges. Dalkamoni is in custody in West Germanypending charges of attacking American military targets.   The Sunday Times also said investigators have questioned aBritish couple, Geoffrey and Christine Middleton, who werevacationing in Malta three weeks before the bombing.   It said they saw a blonde woman and an Arab man ask Westerntourists in a cafe in Sliema to carry a suitcase ``full of fluffytoys'' on a flight from Valletta, Malta's capital. These werepresumably the sixth and seventh people to be named in the report,but the newspaper did not name them.   The Sunday Correspondent, citing unidentified police sources,said the bomb that destroyed Flight 103 began its journey in asuitcase loaded onto a Cyprus Air jet at Larnaca airport.   The newspaper said at least four U.S. intelligence agents whodied on board Flight 103 also began their journey in Larnaca. Threeagents were reported to have been returning from an undercovermission believed to be connected with the U.S. hostages in Lebanon,it said.   One of their suitcases arrived at John F. Kennedy Airport in NewYork three days after the bombing, leading investigators to suspectit may have been substituted at Larnaca airport for the suitcasecontaining the bomb, the newspaper said.</TEXT></DOC>
