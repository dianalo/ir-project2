Inparticular she wanted to know what I thought of the war, itsprobable future course and its outcome especially regardingthe Arab-Israel conflict. For this purpose she had allocatedhalf a minute.   When I protested, it became clear that all she reallywanted from me was to say that the war had been a greatmistake and that it would have been better for everyone if ithad not been started. With this I agreed wholeheartedly, butadded that the war was started not by the coalition on Jan.16, but by Saddam Hussein on Aug. 2. This reply was receivedwith surprise bordering on incredulity, and I came away withthe impression that my half minute would not survive into thefinal version.</LP><TEXT>   It is all too often forgotten that the first shots of thiswar were fired at the beginning of August. After that thechoice, for Iraq's neighbors and ultimately the U.N., was nolonger between war and peace -- that choice was made bySaddam Hussein -- but between resistance and surrender, notone but many surrenders, until finally they would be forcedto fight a stronger enemy, with fewer friends, at a worsetime.   As we know, they chose resistance and won world-widesupport. And now the battle is engaged.   The two immediate questions that confront the world are:Who will win? How long will it take?   Who will win is by no means a foregone conclusion. By thisI do not mean that Saddam Hussein ever had any chance ofdefeating the armed might of the U.S. and its allies. But hedoes not need to do this in order to aim at a politicalvictory. All that he needs is to survive to a cease-fire,with his military and political apparatus still functioning,with himself still in control of it, and with no penaltiesand some reward, however small, for his aggression. Thiswould be enough for him to claim, plausibly, that he haddefied the greatest power in the world and fought it to astandstill.   The consequences would be far-reaching. The response tohis appeal in Arab and some other Muslim countries, duringthe first weeks of the war rather cautious and restrained,would be vastly increased and would acquire tremendousmomentum. U.S. friendship would be discredited not only inthe Middle East, but world-wide. America's Arab allies wouldbe beleaguered and their governments sooner or lateroverthrown. Saddam -- wounded and vengeful -- would be ableto create a new, rich and heavily armed Middle Eastern powerwith considerable support in the Islamic world, and with theadvantage of significant fifth columns in Western Europe, inNorth America, and perhaps also in the southern and centralAsian republics of the Soviet Union.   In previous Middle Eastern wars, Arab leaders, notablyNasser, were able to turn military defeat into politicalvictory by playing the powers against one another. This timethere is no rival superpower to challenge or counterbalancethe U.S. The Soviets are making efforts at least to ensure aseat at the postwar conference table, and -- as Izvestiaremarked a few days ago -- to preserve their Arabcredentials. They still retain some potential for a spoilingrole, which, however, on the whole they are unlikely toadopt.   Other voices that may be called upon to save Saddam fromdefeat are those of some dubious allies, of neutralists inEurope and Asia, of the survivors of the old and new lefts,and those -- both at home and abroad -- who insist onregarding the U.S. as the world's principal source of evil.Their numbers are not very great, but their influence isconsiderable, and could in certain circumstances even have asignificant effect. Many years ago a Turkish general told methat the main problem of having the Americans as allies wasthat &quot;you can never be sure when they will turn around andstab themselves in the back.&quot; This danger remains.   At the present moment, however, such a propaganda victoryfor Saddam Hussein seems unlikely, and it is much moreprobable that the war will end with his defeat, possiblyincluding his elimination. If so, the further consequences,in Iraq and elsewhere, will depend very greatly on the mannerof that defeat and the length of time necessary to procureit.                                                                                                          Iraq                                                                                                          The country most affected will of course be Iraq itself.If defeat comes fairly quickly, there is a reasonable chancethat an alternative government will emerge, with which itmight be possible for the coalition to negotiate. It is,after all, the Iraqis who have been the first and greatestvictims of Saddam's tyranny, and it is they who should havethe first word concerning his replacement.   If the struggle goes on, then the allies may confront asituation rather like that of Germany at the end of World WarII. In Iraq too, the political class has been so utterlydestroyed that there may be no viable alternative. InGermany, it will be recalled, an attempt to assassinateHitler failed and the German armed forces fought on to thebitter end. An admiral was found to sign the surrender, andslowly, painfully, a new leadership was created to build anew German state. In the process, Germany was occupied anddivided. Germany was not united for almost half a century,while major territories were lost to the Soviet Union andPoland.   Iraq is not Germany, and the coalition is not the grandalliance of World War II. It is uncertain that the coalitionwill seek or find an Iraqi Adenauer, and it is certain thatthe coalition has no desire to partition Iraq, still less toannex any part of it. But the danger exists all the same.Iraq is not an old nation-state like Egypt or Iran or Turkey.It is a new country, assembled after World War I, underBritish auspices, from three former Ottoman provinces. Itconsists of highly diverse elements, religious, ethnic andsocial. It is easy to imagine the country degenerating into akind of Lebanese chaos on a larger scale -- Sunni vs. Shiite,Arab vs. Kurd, peasant vs. nomad, as well as a multiplicityof ideological, factional and personal rivalries.   As happened in Lebanon, the neighboring countries wouldinevitably be drawn into the struggle. Iran may wish to beneutral, but the government of the Shiite Islamic republiccould at some stage consider it necessary to intervene inorder to save the Shiite holy places in the Iraqi cities ofNajaf and Karbala from whatever might appear to threatenthem. Turkey might feel a similar interest in the north,where there are large Kurdish and Turkish populations, aswell as major oil fields. Turkey's recent removal of the banon the public use of the Kurdish language might besignificant in this respect. There is thus a serious dangerfor Iraq of chaos, of Lebanonization, and perhaps even of defacto partition. It is unlikely to go so far as de jurepartition, though there might be some nibbling at the edges.   Perhaps the best hope for an early end to the war would befor senior Iraqi officers and politicians to realize that thelonger the war goes on, the greater the threat to the veryexistence of Iraq as a state with its present territoriallimits and political identity. The emergence of analternative government that is genuinely Iraqi, and not acreation of some other state, is clearly in the bestinterests of the country and of the region.                                                                                                          The Palestinians                                                                                                          The Palestinians are likely to be losers whichever way thewar goes. If Saddam triumphs, then they will be puppets onhis string, and he will certainly be less generous withmoney, less tolerant of independent action, than any of theirprevious patrons. If Saddam loses, they will have antagonizedtheir most generous supporters -- the Saudis, the Kuwaitis,the other Gulf rulers. Though these would not abandon thePalestinian cause altogether, they would be less welcoming ontheir territory, less liberal with their resources.   One of the causes of the tragedy that has befallen thePalestinian people has been their leadership -- the manner inwhich that leadership was acquired and the manner in which itwas exercised.   Since the days of the British mandate, the Palestiniancause has been represented by a leadership that attained itsposition by the brutal elimination of all rivals. Thisremains true today. During the Arab rebellion in the 1930s,the Mufti's men killed more Arabs than they killed Jews andBritish combined. Since the beginning of the intifada, theirsuccessors have killed vastly more so-called collaboratorsthan Israelis. One cannot but be astonished at theconsistency with which the Palestinian leadership has chosenthe wrong side. Wrong in both senses -- in that it was thelosing side, but also in a moral sense, in that it was thecause of an odious tyranny whose defeat was a victory notonly for its adversaries, but also for humanity. In World WarII they chose the Axis; in the Cold War, the Soviets; and nowSaddam.   This time the choice is even more perverse. It could beargued, albeit with some difficulty, that in World War II andthe Cold War they had no real option. This time they surelyhad an option -- an Arab option that they rejected. Thiscreates the real danger, for the Palestinians, that when thetime comes, the one voice, which has silenced all others,will itself not be heard. It may be that once again anattempt will be made to revive and reinstall this discreditedleadership. If the attempt succeeds, it may serve otherpurposes, but it will harm the Palestinian people.   The Arab members of the coalition will certainly take upthe Palestinian cause, however little they may like thePalestinian leadership. They will be able to command greaterattention in Washington than in the past, but they will alsofeel freer to say what they really think. Their past recordcannot give much encouragement to Palestinian hopes.   Jordan alone has received Palestinians as citizens andequals. Elsewhere they have remained refugees since 1948. Itis a curious paradox that Palestinians who settled in theU.S. and Western Europe are eligible for citizenship afterfive years, while those who settled in Arab countries, otherthan Jordan, are permanently excluded.                                                                                                          Israel                                                                                                          Israel will be both strengthened and weakened as a resultof the war. The most substantial gain is the removal or atleast the reduction of what could have been a seriousmilitary threat on the eastern front. The missile attackshave also brought some good will to Israel -- respect for therestraint shown by the government, sympathy for thedifficulties endured by the people. The missiles have alsobrought a corresponding loss of sympathy for the Arabs,particularly at the spectacle of Palestinians gleefullyurging the rockets on toward Tel Aviv.   The political capital gained by Israel is, however, bothlimited and transitory. It could be quickly squandered bysuch actions as the administrative detention of the moderatePalestinian leader Sari Nuseibeh -- unwise even if he isguilty as not charged -- or the addition to the governmentcoalition of the extremist Gen. Rehavem Zeevi. Thediscrediting of the Palestinian leadership will not resolvethe Palestinian problem, and Israel's influence in Washingtonwill now be challenged by powerful Arab voices.                                                                                                          Regional Changes                                                                                                          While the Iraqis, the Palestinians and the Israelis willbe the most immediately affected, it is already clear thatthe war and its aftermath will bring major changes to theregion as a whole. When he invaded Kuwait, Saddam broke twotaboos, and the consequences of both violations will befar-reaching and probably permanent.   The first was the taboo on inter-Arab warfare. There havebeen many conflicts between Arab states during the past halfcentury. These have occasionally led to border skirmishes --as for example between Algeria and Morocco, Libya and Egypt,North and South Yemen. There has, however, never been afull-scale invasion, occupation and annexation by one stateof another, in defiance not only of the United NationsCharter, but also, in what is perhaps from an Arab point ofview more important, of the Arab League Pact. Article V ofthe pact lays down quite explicitly that no member shallresort to force against any other member to resolve adispute. Kuwait was a member in good standing of the leagueand, moreover, an ally and benefactor of Iraq.   In spite of Saddam's resort to pan-Arab appeals, hisaction against Kuwait was in fact a step in exactly theopposite direction -- the primacy of state interests, witheach individual Arab country pursuing its own concerns andpolicies, with little regard for the others. In other words,of the various role models that Saddam Hussein has from timeto time named -- Nasser, Saladin, Nebuchadnezzar -- it is thelast whom he follows most closely. The choice of this pagantyrant is far worse than the &quot;pharaonism&quot; for which theEgyptians are sometimes denounced by their Arab brothers.This could well be the point of no return in the decline ofpan-Arabism.   There is a striking parallel with the situation in SpanishAmerica. After the ending of colonial rule, theEnglish-speaking North American colonies were able to bandtogether and form the United States. The Spanish-speakingSouth American colonies failed to do the same. The missedopportunity has not returned, and by now the states ofSpanish America, in spite of their common heritage, havebecome different nations. It seems very likely that the Arabworld will go the same way.   One of the reasons for the decline of pan-Arabism has beenArabs' increasing disillusionment with successive attempts toachieve it. All too often it seemed that the real objectiveof pan-Arab leaders was not so much unity as hegemony. Somechose a German model, each seeing himself as Bismarck and hiscountry as Prussia, with a dominant role to play in theUnited Arab State. Others chose a revolutionary model andtried to displace their Arab fellow rulers by subversion.   By now, all of these states, however artificial in theirorigins, have become realities -- each with a ganglion ofinteracting loyalties and interests and careers. Some of thestates are by no means artificial, but represent ancientnational and territorial entities that existed long beforethe arrival of the imperialists, and survived with theirnational identity unimpaired after the imperialists'departure. Obvious examples are Morocco and Egypt. Others areimperial artifacts, created by the European imperial powersfor their own purposes and appearing for the first time asindependent states after their departure. The most obviousexample is Libya, an Italian creation still bearing a Romanname that the Italian Colonial Ministry gave it. Another,ironically, is Iraq.   When Saddam Hussein broke the taboo on inter-Arab warfare,he was reinforcing an existing trend. The second violation ismuch more important, because it was new and will certainlyhave far-reaching consequences: that is, the questioning ofpost-imperial frontiers. It has hitherto been generallyaccepted in the Middle East, as elsewhere in Asia and Africa,that whatever the misdeeds of the imperialists, it would bedangerous to question the borders they drew. It was agreed torespect these borders, since to question them would open aPandora's box of conflicting claims and internecine warfare.   Saddam Hussein has opened that box. Kuwait as an entityhas existed since the middle of the 18th century. It arosefrom the play of desert politics, and, as so often during thepast millennia, it was recognized, not created, by animperial power. The Romans, the Byzantines, the Persians andthe Ottomans conducted their Arabian policies along similarlines. The frontiers of Kuwait were indeed drawn by Britishofficials, but so were all the other frontiers of Iraq,except for the frontier with Iran, which was finallydelimited by a Turco-Iranian frontier commission, withBritish and Russian observers, shortly before the outbreak ofwar in 1914. Iraq's northern frontier was long disputed, withTurkey claiming the districts of Mosul and Kirkuk. It wassettled in Iraq's favor in 1926, when British pressure wasbrought to bear.   By rejecting the validity of the British drawn frontier ofKuwait, Saddam Hussein has reopened all these questions. Hehas at the same time endangered almost every other frontierin the Mideast, including the frontiers between Syria andLebanon, and between Egypt and its neighbors in Africa. Egypthas far stronger claims to both Libya and Sudan than Iraq toKuwait. This argument also impugns the Palestine Charter ofthe PLO, which defines that country as the territory underthe former British mandate. The choice is understandable,since the only previous independent states in Palestine wereruled by Jews or Crusaders, but the definition is underminedby Saddam's new doctrine.   The decline in pan-Arabism may also bring some advantageand some opportunity to Israel. If Arab states begin toreason in national rather than pan-Arab terms, some of themmay come to the same conclusion as Anwar Sadat, when hedecided that the interests of Egypt, if not of the Arabs,required a peace settlement. They may also see some value inthe presence of a state that, being neither Arab nor Muslim,cannot threaten hegemony, Prussian-style, nor subversion,revolutionary-style, and which could even be a factor ofstability when the inevitable American disengagement comes.                                                                                                          Turkey and Iran                                                                                                          A regional role for Israel in the Middle East is no longerinconceivable, though it is still far from likely. What ismuch more likely is a greater role for the other non-Arabstates, Turkey and Iran. The eclipse of Iraq, howevertemporary, will correspondingly increase the importance ofIran in the Gulf. If Iran's rulers continue to think in termsof national interests rather than Islamic revolution, thatincrease may become permanent. Turkey too may find itselfobliged to abandon its long maintained policy of avoiding anyinvolvement in Arab or Mideastern politics, and be compelledto play a more active part.                                                                                                          The U.S. Role                                                                                                          The length of the war and the manner of its ending willalso vitally affect the future role of the U.S. in the MiddleEast. There is a tendency among many in the region, becauseof the resemblance of language and institutions, to assumethat the U.S. is the British Empire starting up in businessagain with new management and a new address. But those whohope or fear that the U.S. will take the place vacated by theBritish Empire are profoundly wrong. The real danger with theAmericans is not that they will stay, but that they will go.   If Saddam's regime remains in power, the Americans will beobliged to stay, with a difficult if not impossible task toperform. If that regime falls, they would be wise to go, atleast out of sight. They will have accomplished their twomain purposes -- to show that the forcible annexation of apeaceful neighboring state is not tolerable, and to preventthe domination of a large part of the world's oil by amegalomaniac dictator.   The next step would be to help create a regional securitypact, against any recurrence. An American naval presence,with shore facilities, would probably be needed for a while.Anything resembling a military garrison would be a dangerousirritant and a constant reminder of old, well-groundedgrievances.   The longer Saddam Hussein resists, the more heroic thefigure that he cuts, the greater the contempt and hatred forthe mighty powers that seem unable to cope with him. If, onthe other hand, the action against Saddam is expeditious, itis likely that the expected anti-Western reaction will beless important. This expectation is a point on which theexperts have often been wrong. Contrary to all predictions,for example, the bombing raid on Tripoli in 1986 evokedremarkably little response.   This time, too, the reactions were for some timesurprisingly muted. Big demonstrations occurred only incountries whose governments supported Saddam Hussein andprovided the necessary sponsorship. As the struggle hascontinued deeper feelings have been stirred, and hostility issteadily increasing. This could be ended by a swift victory,though even then any sign of irresolution or uncertaintywould soon be detected and used.   The greatest danger for the U.S. is a repetition of whathappened in the years following the Second World War, inparticular in the 1950s, when American policy seemed to be tocultivate the friendship and good will of its enemies anddistance itself from its allies. It is unlikely that the Bushadministration will repeat these errors, but -- given thelack of institutional memory -- one cannot predict what mayhappen afterward.                                                                                                          Arab Domestic Politics                                                                                                          Finally, what is going to happen inside the various Arabcountries in the region? This is perhaps the most difficultof all topics on which to offer any kind of rationalprediction. In the past Arab countries, especially Iraq, havedealt severely with discredited regimes. The same may wellhappen again, and those associated with defeat may be removedand replaced. The interesting question is what will replacethem. Will there be more of the same, or can one really hopefor democratization in the Arab world?   Here one may see limited grounds for very tentative hope.There is now something that has never existed before -- ahuman-rights movement. There are Arab human-rights activistsworking in Europe and America, and even in Arab countries,who do not hesitate to go against ethnic and religiousloyalties to condemn actions by the governments of theircountries. This is small and limited, but it may be a firstsign of better things.   If the countries of the region continue their presentstyle of politics, then the outlook will be very dark forthem. It is sometimes said that the West in general and theU.S. in particular are in danger of losing the good will ofthe Arab world. There is also the danger that the Arab world-- at least that part of it that acclaims Saddam Hussein asits political and moral standard-bearer -- may lose the goodwill of the West and the U.S., and this is something thatthey should ponder.   ---   Mr. Lewis is professor emeritus of Near Eastern studies atPrinceton.</TEXT></DOC>
