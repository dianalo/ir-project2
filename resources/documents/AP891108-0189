U.S. District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer issued thepreliminary injunction against Operation Rescue and VeteransCampaign for Life, which plan demonstrations the next two weekendsin the nation's capital.   The injunction was issued at the request of the NationalOrganization of Women and nine other groups and medical facilities.   Oberdorfer rejected a request from NOW to broaden the injunctionso that it covers all three dozen or so abortion facilities in themetropolitan area.   At a court hearing earlier this week, attorney John Schaefersaid Operation Rescue has harassed and intimidated women seekingabortions, inflicting psychological and emotional harm duringblockades outside clinics in various parts of the country.   Jay Sekulow said NOW's allegations are ``devoid of facts'' andthat there is no evidence Operation Rescue is involved in any typeof violent activity outside clinics.   Patrick Mahoney, an Operation Rescue consultant, said he hasbeen in Washington for five weeks planning this week'sdemonstrations and that ``I have no idea'' whether blockadingabortion clinics is among the activities.   Questioned by the judge, Mahoney said there is a possibilityOperation Rescue has plans Mahoney doesn't know about.   Operation Rescue is ``sidestepping back and forth'' by refusingto say whether its members will trespass on private property atabortion clinics, said attorney Laurence Eistenstein.   But ``they will, as they have in the past,'' Eisenstein assertedto the judge.   Eisenstein said Operation Rescue has ``become a little moresophisticated'' by using euphemisms like ``rescue'' for breakingthe law.</TEXT></DOC>
