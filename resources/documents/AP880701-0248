Their most recent setback came at the end of June when they lostground in local elections in northern Italy.   ``This is one of the most difficult moments in our history,''said Achille Occhetto, the new leader of the party, which is thelargest Communist Party in the West and Italy's second largestpolitical party.   The Communists' dramatic decline reportedly helped force out the70-year-old Alessandro Natta as the party leader. His resignation,following a heart attack, marked the first time in the party'shistory that a Communist leader had stepped down in Italy.   Occhetto, 52, inherited a party divided over its identity andunsure how to appeal to an electorate, which is less blue-collarand more conservative than in the past.   ``We've said we don't want to follow the Russians, the (Italian)Socialists or the Americans,'' said a Communist senator, StojanSpetic. ``We're still searching for an answer.''   The prolonged search has hurt the Communists' morale _ and theirpopularity.   A year ago, the Italian Communist Party _ known as the PCI, itsinitials in Italian _ suffered its worst defeat in parliamentaryelections in 20 years, slipping to 26.6 percent of the vote.   In May, the Communists dropped to 21.9 percent of the vote inlocal elections, down from 25.8 percent in 1983. The balloting inlate June in the north reduced their share of the vote in tworegions from 19.8 percent to 15.7 percent.   Meanwhile, the Socialist Party of former Premier Bettino Craxihas surged, challenging the Communists for leadership of the left.   Many Communists are pinning their hopes for revival on Occhetto.   Occhetto is ``perfectly conscious of the necessity and theurgency of creating a new PCI,'' said La Repubblica, theleft-leaning Rome newspaper.   One of the party's pillars, the blue-collar working class, hasdeclined in number during Italy's economic and technological boom.   Young people who traditionally voted heavily for the Communistsare now spreading their votes among different parties.   ``Today's young people don't have idealistic values,'' Sen.Spetic said in an interview. ``They are much more pragmatic. Theywant work, careers.''   In a speech to party members, Occhetto noted the shrinkage inthe party's traditional bases of support and said this ``puts inquestion even us, and it is from this consideration that we oughtto draw our new course.''   It would not be the first time the Italian Communists changedcourse.   In the 1970s, Communist leader Enrico Berlinguer proclaimed theparty's independence from the Soviet Union. Gone were the days whenthe party was known as ``the other church'' with its ``pope'' inMoscow; Italian Communists sought to achieve power through thedemocratic system.   The party, which had been kept out of the government since 1947,won 34 percent of the votes in the 1976 elections _ just fourpoints below the dominant Christian Democrats.   But Berlinguer was unable to persuade the Christian Democrats togive him Cabinet seats, and he had to settle for being consulted onmajor issues.   Since then, the Socialists have enhanced their reputation as analternative through Craxi's position as head of the governingcoalition for three years, up to mid-1987.   Since the death of the charismatic Berlinguer in 1984, theCommunist Party has wrestled over what kind of alternative itshould be.   Party officials talked of re-examining its revolutionary roots,or seeking a social democratic line _ perhaps even changing itsname.   A poll by L'Espresso magazine of 234 Communist supporters whohad voted recently for a different party indicated that the largestgroup _ 30 percent _ complained of the lack of a clear Communistpolitical line.   An invigorated brand of communism in the Soviet Union has notgiven new luster to Italy's party.   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's criticism of Stalin and rejection of someMarxist principles have been seen as indictments of the history ofthe Italian party, which supported Stalin in its early days.   ``It is the lethal combination of the Craxi (Socialist) effectand the Gorbachev effect which has thrown the PCI against theropes,'' Enzo Bettiza, a former European Parliament deputy from theLiberal Party, wrote in the newspaper La Stampa of Turin.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs July 8</NOTE></DOC>
