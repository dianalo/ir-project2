The new report strongly attacked the original researchthat found a link between the use of intrauterine devicessuch as the Dalkon Shield and infections that can causesevere damage to a woman's reproductive tract. The report,carried in the current issue of the Journal of ClinicalEpidemiology, which is published in Britain, said are-analysis of the original research's data found no higherrisk of infections among users of IUD contraceptives.</LP><TEXT>   Officials in Richmond, Va., who run the Dalkon ShieldClaims Resolution Facility, said they may use the re-analysisin court to fight lawsuits women may bring against the trustfund.   The original study, disclosed in 1981 and funded by thefederal government, led to a flood of lawsuits against A.H.Robins Co., maker of the Dalkon Shield. The claims, in turn,forced Robins into bankruptcy-law proceedings. As part of itsagreement to acquire Robins, American Home Products Co.funded an independent trust to settle about 100,000 claims bywomen who charge they were damaged by the Dalkon Shield.   But the new study itself is certain to raise a storm ofquestions about scientific integrity. The study was carriedout by Richard Kronmal, a statistician who served as a paidexpert witness for Robins in court cases involving the DalkonShield about 10 years ago. Mr. Kronmal, in a preface to hisnewly published report, said he conducted the re-analysis ofthe original research about eight years ago with fundsprovided by Robins. He said he decided to publish thefindings now because he believed that all legal actioninvolving the Dalkon Shield had been resolved.   &quot;I didn't know there was still a potential for disputeover payment of claims,&quot; Mr. Kronmal said in a telephoneinterview. &quot;I wanted to set the record straight, not getinvolved in legal proceedings.&quot;   The release of Mr. Kronmal's sharply worded attack comesat an especially crucial time in the distribution of thetrust's funds. The Dalkon Shield trust has just begunnegotiating with women who declined an initial cashsettlement. If an agreement can't be reached, the women havea right to take their claim to arbitration, or to court.   &quot;The timing {of the study's release} does seem odd,&quot; saidStephen H. Fredkin, a Salinas, Calif., attorney representingwomen who are seeking compensation from the trust.   Michael Sheppard, executive director of the trust, saidthe trust's legal counsel would use the new study's findings&quot;on a case-by-case basis&quot; if it helped to defend cases thatwent to arbitration or to court. Mr. Kronmal said he has beenasked by the trust to testify in future hearings, adding thathe has agreed to testify if asked.   In the new study, Mr. Kronmal, a professor ofbiostatistics at the University of Washington in Seattle,said the original research was biased by several designflaws. In particular, he argued, the original researchers intheir report, called the Women's Health Study, excluded dataregarding numerous women who had a history of the kind ofinfections linked to IUD use. &quot;Much of the methodology isfundamentally flawed,&quot; Mr. Kronmal said, &quot;and that calls intoquestion the conclusion that IUDs can increase a women's riskof infections.&quot;   In a rebuttal in the same issue of the Journal, theoriginal study's authors said Mr. Kronmal's critique &quot;isreplete with factual error, misrepresentation, andoverstatement.&quot;   In a statement, the original study's chief author, RonaldBurkman of Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, said he wouldn'tcomment until the American College of Obstetricians andGynecologists issued a review of Mr. Kronmal's critique.   --   Milo Geyelin contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
