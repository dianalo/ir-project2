StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDAMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The U.S. Federal Reserve is putting more muscle into its effort to support the dollar than initially was thought last week, some currency traders say.    These traders, who have direct access to the Fed's trading patterns, indicate that the U.S. central bank was buying several hundred million dollars a day at times. The Fed's goal in such intervention is to increase demand for dollars in hope of bolstering the U.S. currency's international value.    The fact that large dollar purchases by the Fed and other central banks failed to halt the currency's slide for much of last week indicates the depth of bearish sentiment in the market. But it also suggests increased U.S. resolve to counter that mood.    The dollar did rebound somewhat Thursday and Friday, particularly against the Japanese yen, with help from a warning late Wednesday by Treasury Secretary James Baker about the risks of a continued dollar slump. The calendar also aided the U.S. currency, as many traders squared their dollar positions in preparation for the Easter holiday weekend.    The dollar's weakness early last week led some traders to regard the Fed's intervention as half-hearted. Joseph Volpicella, head of foreign exchange trading at Spavo Financial Corp., a New York-based money manager, said the U.S. was considered a &quot;reluctant participant&quot; in the effort to keep the dollar's value up.    But a trader familiar with the Fed's activities indicated that the central bank's intervention &quot;wasn't so small&quot; on some days. This trader speculated that foreign-exchange dealers may return from the holiday weekend less inclined to dump the dollar.    With about $18 billion in foreign-currency reserves, the Fed would seem well-equipped to continue its intervention. But its holdings are scattered among a large number of foreign currencies, and the biggest pressure on the dollar has come from the soaring Japanese yen. Thus, some traders wonder how long the Fed can continue to sell yen and buy dollars without depleting its supply of the Japanese currency.    &quot;If the (West German) Bundesbank, Federal Reserve and Bank of England are all intervening, selling yen and buying dollars, they must borrow the yen from somewhere else, or else they will drain their foreign exchange reserves,&quot; Yani Budiman, vice president, foreign exchange, at New York's Chemical Bank, said. He speculated that &quot;through swap arrangements, most probably the Bank of Japan will give them what they need.&quot;    In an indication that such swaps are being considered, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said last week that the major industrial countries had held &quot;concrete talks on the issue of raising funds with which to intervene in the currency markets to support the dollar.&quot;    His remarks were seen as a sign that the Bank of Japan was strengthening its swap agreements with other major central banks to try to keep the yen stable.    Lawrence L. Kreicher, vice president and economist at Irving Trust Co., said &quot;the market was exhausted&quot; last week. He predicted that the dollar &quot;will stabilize, then begin to dance all over again.&quot;    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar firmed in sparse trading, with many market participants absent for the Easter weekend.    New York and Tokyo were the only major trading centers open, and most U.S. banks' currency desks had only minimal staffing. Many U.S. dealers went home by midday.    Trading is likely to remain light today, the last day of the four-day holiday weekend in Europe.    The dollar stuck to a narrow range Friday and late in the day stood at 143.09 yen, up marginally from 143.00 Thursday. The dollar also advanced to 1.8143 West German marks from 1.8105.    In early trading Monday in Tokyo, the dollar stood at 143.00 yen.    ---                 LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Friday, April 17, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
