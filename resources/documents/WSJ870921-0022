The World Bank's participation in the package will total 4.4 billion yen ($30.8 million).    The syndicated loan was arranged by a group of 14 Japanese financial institutions, including Bank of Tokyo Ltd., to provide Turkey with additional foreign exchange to finance imports needed for several new power plants and other energy-related projects.    The World Bank previously approved a $325 million loan to Turkey for an energy-sector adjustment program, while Japan's Export-Import Bank announced last month that it would provide Turkey with the equivalent of $300 million in credits for energy generation and distribution projects. The credits are &quot;untied,&quot; meaning that Turkey won't be obligated to use them to purchase Japanese products.    In other actions, the World Bank and its affiliate, the International Development Association, cleared $89 million in loans to Uganda to support the African country's economic-recovery program.    The World Bank approved a $65 million loan to El Salvador to help rebuild roads, power lines and other facilities damaged for a severe earthquake that hit the country last October.    The bank also cleared a $13 million loan to Thailand to help improve operations of the country's railway system.    The loans to Uganda will be interest-free except for administrative fees; the loans to El Salvador and Thailand will be at the bank's variable lending rate, currently 7.76% a year. </TEXT></DOC>
