Economists said the trend, the result of acreage-reduction programs in the U.S. and other large countries in the face of continued economic growth, points to a gradual increase in global agricultural prices over the next several months.    The department also projected that continuing bad weather in the major grain-producing areas of the Soviet Union would force Moscow to increase grain imports to 36 million tons in the year starting July 1, from a revised estimated 30 million tons for the 1986-87 year.    Rumors that the Soviets have begun sounding out sellers on another big wheat purchase -- beyond the four million metric tons of U.S. wheat they agreed to buy April 30 -- sent wheat prices soaring in U.S. markets yesterday. As usual, the Agriculture Department declined to comment on the reports.    In a separate report yesterday, the department predicted that the U.S. winter wheat crop will increase slightly this year, even though farmers have cut the number of acres under production.    The Agricultural Statistics Board forecast that U.S. winter wheat output will total 1.55 billion bushels in 1987, up about 2% from the 1.52 billion bushels produced in 1986. The rise came despite a 10% decline in the number of acres expected to be harvested.    Department economists said the sharply higher yields reflected favorable weather during the winter and farmers' response to federal incentives to reduce the acreage under production by leaving their marginal lands idle. Yields are expected to average 39.9 bushels an acre this year, compared with 35.2 bushels in 1986.    The agency also forecast that production of citrus fruits in the U.S. would rise 10% this season to 12.1 million tons, mainly because of better-than-expected weather in the major growing regions.    The report on global crop production this year marked an important change in the trend of recent years. For much of the early 1980s, the world suffered from a glut of agricultural products, which has helped depress prices and plunge the farming sector into a slump. Grain stocks world-wide have been bulging; last year U.S. grain stocks grew by some 46 million tons.    This year, however, Agriculture Department economists expect the U.S. to consume some 12 million more tons of grain than it produces, providing the first opportunity in four years to draw down existing stocks and nudge farm prices slightly higher. The department didn't provide figures on global supply and demand, but said the two would be roughly in line this year. </TEXT></DOC>
