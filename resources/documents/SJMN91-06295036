Not asingle home among at least two dozen clustered just off Skyline Boulevard hadbeen spared. Tiny wisps of white smoke rose from the sterile, blackenedwasteland, as if the neighborhood was letting out its last few breaths.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE VIEW FROM ABOVE: BLACKENED WASTELAND AND PINKEXPLOSIONS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Oakland Hills Fire; See also related stories on pages 1A and 8-12A of thissection.  </MEMO><TEXT>     With nothing left to consume on the ridge, the wind-propelled fire took offtoward the southwest, crawling down the hillside. Gnarled fingers of flamelunged in all directions, grabbing whatever they wanted to claim.;   Each timethe flames swallowed up another home or stand of trees, a wall of fire shothigh in the air. Other explosions in shocking pink -- brighter than anyfireworks -- pierced the smoky sky when several PGandamp;E transformers blew up oneby one.;   In a furious race against time, tanker planes and helicopterscrisscrossed the grimy sky, scooping up buckets of water from reservoirs andcarefully negotiating their way through the dense smoke.;   &quot;Did you see theman standing on the road with a garden hose?&quot; radioed one pilot. &quot;Yeah, I'mgoing to go in and give him a dump,&quot; another radioed back. &quot;He's pissing inthe wind,&quot; chimed in another.;   By late afternoon, dozens and dozens ofglowing orange spots dotted the landscape like gigantic embers in a massivefireplace. The hills took on a gray cast as charred homes became covered withash.;   A mushroom cloud of smoke and ash shot more than a mile high overOakland, engulfing the sun and creating an ugly, burnt-orange pall across theentire bay.;   Amid the chaos and the smoke, one could make out theunmistakable profile of the Claremont Hotel. The stately white edifice stooddefiantly against the blackened sky, as if holding up the devastated hillsidesingle-handedly.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARY ANNE OSTROM, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911021  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  354  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, October 21, 199100295036,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
