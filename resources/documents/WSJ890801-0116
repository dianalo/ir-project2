But some investors may be better off sitting tight. While prices of some partnership interests are falling, the prices of others are rising as buyers crowd in to capitalize on all the bad news.    These are the findings of a recent Wall Street Journal survey of secondary-market trading activity by a number of small investment firms that buy partnership interests secondhand from investors, either for their own accounts or for resale to new investors.    Brokerage industry officials estimated earlier this summer that at least $5 billion -- and probably much more -- of publicly offered limited partnerships marketed this decade are failing. Those known to be seriously troubled represent about 20% of the roughly $100 billion of partnerships sold by major Wall Street firms and other syndicators in recent years.    Analysts warn, however, that all partnerships shouldn't be tarred with the same brush. &quot;You've got firms calling investors day and night trying to get them to sell at prices that may have little or no relationship to their underlying values,&quot; says Spencer Jefferies, president of Dallas-based Partnership Profiles Inc., a research firm. &quot;They're working off of all the negative publicity about the problems that are out there, primarily in real estate partnerships.&quot;    As many as 12 million individuals hold interests in partnerships that own everything from shopping centers to cable-TV systems, shipping containers and oil wells. Designed as long-term investments, they typically have lives of about 10 years before the assets are sold and investors are paid off.    Until then, the informal secondary market is practically the only place investors can sell partnership interests they no longer want -- albeit at steep discounts from the original offering prices.    The Journal survey, the third in a continuing study, covers secondary-market trading in 20 partnerships during the second quarter of this year. Thirteen secondary-market firms supplied information. That activity was compared with trading three months earlier. Although the partnerships tracked are just a small sample of the overall market, many of them are among the largest offered back in the heyday of such syndications between 1980 and 1987.    The rising tide of partnerships going sour -- amid brokers' wails that some Wall Street firms selling the most partnerships pressured them to push highly risky deals -- has clearly spooked many investors.    During the second quarter, investors in some widely held real estate partnerships in the Journal survey accepted prices that were as much as 37% below the worst offers investors settled for in the first quarter. Overall, the best prices investors got when selling averaged 39.3% below the original offering price, the same as in the preceding quarter.    With a growing number of secondary-market &quot;players,&quot; several firms say there is less disparity in the prices buyers are willing to pay for partnership interests than there was a year ago. In other words, they claim the market is becoming more efficient.    Perhaps, but clearly investors should still seek several bids before they sell. There was a difference of more than $100 a unit between the high and low prices investors received for their interests in four of the real estate partnerships in the latest survey, one leasing partnership and one cable-TV partnership.    Many of the investors attracted to the partnership secondary market apparently want high current income. And secondary-market investment yields certainly can seem terrific. For example, the estimated secondary-market yields for several partnerships in the latest survey exceed 10%. This estimate is calculated by dividing cash distributions in the latest four quarters by the most recent average prices investors paid for secondhand partnership interests.    But partnership yields can be illusory. Payouts to partnership investors often fluctuate -- and they can suddenly dry up altogether. Moreover, cash distributions of some types of partnerships, such as equipment-leasing syndications, frequently include not only earnings but a portion of the investors' original capital.    Most important, high yields in the secondary market reflect the steep discounts from the original offering price at which interests in many older partnerships trade.    Corporate Property Associates 3, the only real estate partnership in the survey to consistently trade above its original sales price, again fetched a handsome 17% premium. &quot;The reason is simple. It produces good cash flow, something in excess of 15% on an original $500 unit,&quot; says Glen Bigelow, president of Bigelow Management Inc., a New York-based secondary-market firm. Over the years, he adds, the partnership, which owns industrial warehouses, has produced modest but steady increases in those quarterly payouts.    On average, investors who sold their interests in the seven other &quot;equity,&quot; or property-owning, real estate partnerships at the highest prices accepted discounts of 35.2% below their original cost. That was three percentage points less than last quarter's average discount for this group.    Prices on the two real estate mortgage partnerships in the survey went in different directions. The best price investors got when selling interests in Balcor Pension Investors VI in the second quarter was 2.4% higher than in the first quarter (although it was still more than 31% below the original offering price). But the best price investors could get when selling units of Consolidated Capital Institutional Properties 2 sank almost 46%. The Consolidated partnership suspended distributions last December.    The equipment-leasing partnerships in the Journal survey also presented a mixed picture this time around. The best price investors got when selling interests in Polaris Aircraft Income Fund II was 8.8% higher than in the first quarter, while the best price for IEA Marine Container Income Fund III was 3.7% higher. But the best price for interests in Phoenix Leasing Income Fund VII slipped 5.6% from the first quarter, and the best price for interests in PLM Transportation Equipment Partners VII-B fell 32%.    None of the oil and gas partnerships in the survey traded in the latest quarter, although secondary-market firms say they bought interests in other, similar energy ventures. Sales of new energy offerings were also brisk. Integrated Resources Inc., the troubled financial-services firm, is seeking to dissolve one program the Journal survey tracks, National Completion Fund Limited Partnership II-A.    Secondary-market prices of the two cable-TV partnerships in the survey also went in opposite directions this time around. Investors who sold interests in Denver-based Jones Intercable Inc.'s Cable TV Fund 12-D got a premium of as much as 45% above the original offering price. Three months earlier, the premium was 35%.    The best price investors got when selling interests in the far smaller Enstar Income/Growth Program Five-B was 17.2% below the original offering price. In the first quarter, some investors sold interests in the Enstar partnership at a 135.6% premium.    ---@ Secondary-Market Discounts    Average percent below (or above) original offering prices received by investors selling partnership interests at the best prices @ QUARTER QUARTER @ ENDED ENDED @ TYPE 6/30/89* 3/31/89# @ Real Estate -39.3% -39.3% @ Leasing -40.9 -38.6 @ Oil andamp; Gas N.A -40.0 @ Cable TV +28.0 +210.8    *10 real estate partnerships, 4 leasing partnerships, 0 oil-and-gas partnerships and 2 cable-TV partnerships traded at 13 secondary-market firms.    #9 real estate partnerships, 4 leasing partnerships, 2 oil-and-gas partnerships and 2 cable-TV partnerships traded at 12 secondary-market firms. </TEXT></DOC>
