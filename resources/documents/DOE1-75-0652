The results are presented in tablesand graphs (along with data from simple VLA detection observations in1985 and published optical and X-ray data) and characterized in detail.No strong correlation is found between the radio and optical emissionin the one star (BY Dra) detected at more than one session, and the observablemicrowave emission of the stars is tentatively attributed to flares alone.A weak correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the maximum 6-cmluminosity of dMe stars is inferred, but the evidence is considered insufficientto establish a relationship between surface signs of magnetic activityand nonthermal radio emission. 36 references.</TEXT></DOC>
