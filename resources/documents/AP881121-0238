In ``Mitla Pass,'' the history is his own.   ``I was looking for a legacy to leave my new family and mygrandchildren,'' said Uris, the 64-year-old author of such bestsellers as ``Exodus'' and ``QB VII.''   ``Mitla Pass'' (Doubleday, $19.95), which closely follows thelives of Uris and his family, begins in Israel in 1956 during thetime of the Suez Canal crisis and centers on the experiences of theauthor's alter ego, Gideon Zadok, a writer covering the incident.The novel then traces Zadok's ancestry back to the 1880s, allowingvarious relatives to tell their stories.   Uris lives in Aspen, Colo., with his third wife, Jill, and hopesthe book will bring him closer to their two children.   ``I wanted to leave them with a story of what their old man didand let them know he was not infallible. ... You spend the secondhalf of your life getting over your first half,'' he said.   ``I want them to learn that their daddy gets frightened. That hemakes mistakes. I wanted to humanize the relationship very early.''   Uris quickly points to his own experience. In ``Mitla Pass,'' thewriter had difficulties with both parents.   ``Those relationships took me 60 years to get some understanding_ their relationship with me that hurt me a great deal, brought me agreat deal of pain as a child. What I long for is a betterrelationship with my own children.''   Like Zadok, Uris was born in Baltimore and spent several yearsgrowing up in Norfolk, Va. His father, Wolf William, was a paperhanger and storekeeper. Uris remembered him as an unhappy man.   ``I think his personality was formed by the harsh realities ofbeing a Jew in Czarist Russia,'' he said. ``He was basically afailure. He went from failure to failure. I think failure formed hischaracter, made him bitter.   ``I think I can say without hesitation that from earliest memoryI was determined not to be a failure.''   Uris credits his mother, Anna, with teaching him an appreciationof the arts, but says they did not get along.   ``Her life was such that there was a heavy distrust of men, inlarge part because of a very cruel father. We were essentiallydisinterested in each other. She was inside of her own head theresomewhere.''   Uris struggled to establish his own independence and World WorldII provided the perfect opportunity.   ``All societies that I know of are shaped by macho, the need of aman to be macho,'' said Uris, who served as a marine. ``There's nobetter proving ground than a war. The war came along at a time whenI needed to go war. My time had run out at being at home. The warworked into my life.''   After the war, he began submitting articles to magazines andfinally had a piece, ``The All American Razzmatazz,'' published inthe January 1951 issue of ``Esquire.''   His first novel, ``Battle Cry,'' a story about the Marine Corps,was released in 1953 and made into a film. Two years later, he cameout with ``The Angry Hills,'' a spy novel, and in 1956, traveled toIsrael to begin research on ``Exodus,'' his most famous work. Thenovel, which depicted the history of European Jewry from the turn ofthe century to the establishment of Israel, was released in 1958 andsold millions of copies.   ```Exodus' has been the Bible of the Jewish dissident movement inRussia,'' Uris said. ``It's referred to as `The Book.'''   Uris has also written about the Warsaw Ghetto resistance in``Mila 18,'' post-World War II Germany in ``Armageddon'' and theCuban missile crisis in ``Topaz.'' For ``Trinity,'' the story ofthree Irish families from the mid-19th century to the Easter Risingof 1916, Uris was given the Irish Institute's John F. Kennedy Awardin 1976.   But now the author wants to deal with more personal matters.   ``My motivation is to be on a one-and-one basis with my readers.To say, `Look, I'm old enough and wise enough to work in this areaof human relationships.' This is what the world's all about, otherpeople,'' he said.   Uris said researching ``Mitla Pass'' made him see himself in anentirely different way. ``I used to think of myself as a very sadlittle Jewish boy, isolated in a Southern town, undersized,asthmatic.   ``When I read all my correspondence again, I realized I was ahustler,'' he said. ``I was tough. I used everything to myadvantage. I could be very ruthless. I hurt a lot of people on theway up.''   Now, he said, smiling, ``I'm mellowed out.''   To research ``Mitla Pass,'' Uris pored through 100,000 pieces ofcorrespondence, a process that was physically and emotionallyexhausting.   ``It was painful. I would get to my office at noon and be deadasleep on my couch at 2. I was so depressed. This book drained me.''   Yet once he began writing ``Mitla Pass,'' the words came easily.   ``So much was stored up for so long that I almost set thetypewriter on automatic,'' Uris said. ``It's a wild structure butit's the way I wrote the first time around.''   His books are usually enormous in scope, covering extensiveperiods of time and requiring painstaking research. He has beencriticized for an overblown writing style and for making hischaracters one-dimensional.   But readers have been unable to resist his epic tales.   ``I have a good relationship with my readers,'' Uris said. ``Ifyou haven't anything to say, you sit down and shut up. I feel I havesomething to say that has value.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Dec 2-4</NOTE></DOC>
