These regulations allow the establishment of definite American viticulturalareas. The regulations also allow the name of an approved viticulturalarea to be used as an appellation of origin in the labeling and advertisingof wine. On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision ATF-60 (44 FR 56692)which added to Title 27 a new Part 9 providing for the listing of approvedAmerican viticultural areas, the names of which may be used as appellationsof origin. Section 4.25a(e)(1) of Title 27, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 4, definesan American viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing region distinguishableby geographical features, the boundaries of which have been delineatedin Subpart C of Part 9. Section 4.25a(e)(2), outlines the procedure for proposing an American viticulturalarea. Any interested person may petition ATF to establish a grape-growingregion as a viticultural area. The petition shall include_ (a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural area is locallyand/or nationally known as referring to the area specified in the petition;(b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries of the viticulturalarea are as specified in the petition; (c) Evidence relating to the geographical characteristics (climate, soil,elevation, physical features, etc.) which distinguish the viticulturalfeatures of the proposed area from surrounding areas; (d) A description of the specific boundary of the proposed viticulturalarea, based on features which can be found on United States GeologicalSurvey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the largest applicable scale; and (e) A copy (or copies) of the appropriate U.S.G.S. map(s) with the proposedboundary prominently marked. <ITAG tagnum="84">Petition </ITAG>ATF received a petition proposing a viticultural area in Santa Clara, SanBenito, San Mateo and Alameda Counties that extends from lower San FranciscoBay from the cities of San Jose, Santa Clara, Menlo Park, Mountain Viewand Fremont on the north to Gilroy and Morgan Hill on the southern end.The area proposed was approximately 550 square miles or 352,000 acres.Most of the proposed area was in Santa Clara County. In recent years rapidgrowth in population in this region has forced out most of the former largebonded wineries and vineyards from the northern end of the Valley to otherareas in California. Lying amidst the suburban development at the northeasternend of the Santa Clara Valley at Warm Springs in Alameda County (near MissionSan Jose and Fremont) is one of the original wineries established in theValley. This 400 acre winery now known as the Weibel Vineyards was formerlythe Leland Stanford Winery established in 1869. Historical records document that this northeast portion of the viticulturalarea has long been considered a part of the Santa Clara Valley. Becausethis land in Alameda County meets the viticultural area evidence requirementsit is included as part of the Santa Clara Valley viticultural area. The boundary description in the notice of proposed rulemaking (No. 653,published February 4, 1988) included a small part of San Mateo County (RedwoodCity, Atherton, Menlo Park and Woodside).This final rule does not include the approximately 30 square miles in SanMateo County that was proposed in the notice of proposed rulemaking. Theapproved viticultural area boundary does not include any land in San MateoCounty because it was determined that the area north of the Santa ClaraCounty/San Mateo County (Los Trancos Creek/San Francisquito Creek) boundaryis not locally and or nationally known as being part of the Santa ClaraValley. The evidence showed that this small area is more closely associatedwith another region north and west of the valley. The evidence showed thatthe Redwood City, Atherton and Menlo Park areas are more closely associatedwith the City of San Francisco and the San Francisco Bay communities. Thosecities immediately south of San Francisco running along the San FranciscoBay have long been known as ``peninsula communities'' of San Franciscoand they are not part of the named area, known as the Santa Clara Valley,which is to the south. The evidence also showed that Woodside to the extremewest of the Santa Clara Valley is more closely associated with the nearbySanta Cruz Mountains. Other evidence that supports the establishment ofthe northwest boundary of the Santa Clara Valley in Santa Clara Countyshows that another named valley known as the Portola Valley, is locatedto the southeast of Palo Alto in San Mateo County. This final rule excludesthis area in San Mateo County (Redwood City, Atherton, Menlo Park and Woodside)from being part of the Santa Clara Valley viticultural area. The northwestboundary has been redrawn to include an area as far north as Palo Altoin Santa Clara County. The approved northwest boundary is defined by thenatural boundaries of San Francisquito Creek and Los Trancos Creek whichalso represent the San Mateo County/Santa Clara County boundary. The Santa Clara Valley viticultural area is protected from the PacificOcean by the Santa Cruz Mountains on the west and separated from the SanJoaquin Valley by the Diablo Mountain Range on the east. To the north ofthe Santa Clara Valley is the San Francisco Bay and surrounding Bay communities.There are approximately 40 bonded wineries in the viticultural area withan estimated total of 1,500 acres of grapes. The approved viticulturalarea is approximately 530 square miles or 339,200 acres. <ITAG tagnum="84">Name </ITAG>The term ``Santa Clara Valley'' has been used in local books written from1871 to present. The area has a long history as a grape-growing area. Asstated by Mr. Leon Adams in his book, <T3>The Wines of America, </T3>``Santa Clara is the oldest of northernCalifornia wine districts.'' The tourist pamphlet <T3>San Jose-Santa Clara County, California (with full information on theSanta Clara Valley) </T3>published by the San Jose Chamber of Commerce(circa 1905) described the geographical features and local agricultureof the Santa Clara Valley. The best evidence of the area's identificationas the Santa Clara Valley is indicated on the United States GeologicalSurvey (U.S.G.S.) maps that depict and name the entire valley area froma topographic viewpoint. <ITAG tagnum="84">Boundaries </ITAG>U.S.G.S. maps with the boundaries of the viticultural area (and vineyardsand bonded wineries) appropriately marked were submitted with the petition.A few small mountain vineyards exist north and west of San Jose, but thebulk of the valley's northernmost grape growing has faded under urban development.Most of the wineries in the Santa Clara Valley viticultural area are locatedwhere the valley narrows south of San Jose in the Morgan Hill, Gilroy andHecker Pass areas. In 1982, the Santa Cruz Mountains viticultural area was approved by ATF(T.D. ATF-98, 46 FR 59240). This grape growing area is located immediatelyto the west of the Santa Clara Valley viticultural area. Much of the westernboundary of the proposed Santa Clara Valley viticultural area is commonlyshared with the eastern boundary of the Santa Cruz Mountains viticulturalarea.<ITAG tagnum="84">Geographic Features </ITAG>(a) Climate All references to the Santa Clara Valley in early publications made mentionof the rich fertile soil of the valley floor which was protected from thecolder ocean conditions by the nearby Santa Cruz Mountains located to thewest and from the much hotter interior temperatures of the San JoaquinValley with the Diablo Range to the east. The climate of the Santa ClaraValley is moderate, with warm, dry summers, mild wet winters, and prevailingnorthwest winds. Summer temperatures can rise above 100 degrees F. at times.The annual average temperature is 58 to 60 degrees F. The growing seasonbetween killing frosts is fairly long, ranging from 250 to 300 days. Thearea falls into climate region II (cool) with a heat summation of 2,700degree days. Heavy frosts do not occur in the viticultural area, althoughtemperatures often get below freezing in winter. Most of the days are sunny,although in summer a high fog often hangs over the valley in the morninghours. The nearby Santa Cruz Mountains (to the west) fall into climate RegionI (very cool) having 2,500 or fewer degree days. The Santa Cruz Mountainsare characterized by a climate which is greatly influenced in the westernportion by the Pacific Ocean breezes and fog movements, and in the easternportion by the moderating influences of the San Francisco Bay. The SantaCruz Mountains are characterized by a growing season in excess of 300 days.This is due to cool air coming down the mountains forcing warmer air upward,thereby lengthening the season in which the necessary conditions for grape-growingare present. Temperatures in the slopes of the hillsides of the Santa Cruz Mountainswhere most of the vineyards are located appear to vary from that at thelower elevations of the vineyards in the Santa Clara Valley. This is causedby the marine influence coming off the Pacific Ocean which cools the SantaCruz Mountains at night, much more so than the farther inland Santa ClaraValley floor. The rich San Joaquin Valley located on the east side of the Diablo Rangeis in Region V (very warm climate). The Livermore Valley (an American viticulturalarea) located 15 miles northeast of the Santa Clara Valley viticulturalarea is mostly in Region III (moderately cool climate).(b) Rainfall and Winds The average rainfall in the Santa Clara Valley is between 16 to 20 inches.The rainy season, when 80% of the rain falls, extends from November throughMarch. Annual precipitation to the west averages over 28 inches annuallyat coastal Santa Cruz and over 58 inches annually at Ben Lomond in theelevated areas of the Santa Cruz Mountains. In the Diablo Range, to theeast, precipitation is as much as 30 inches annually. Rainfall in the mountainousportions increases rapidly with elevations, although much less so in theDiablo Range than in the Santa Cruz Mountains. There is a greater amountof rainfall in the Santa Cruz Mountains because they are located closeto the Pacific Ocean. Rainfall in the Livermore Valley (to the northeast)averages only 14 inches annually. During the summer, the cool temperatures and the prevailing moderate tostrong, west and northwest offshore winds move into the San Francisco Bayarea at low elevations, thus, the effect of the marine air is felt in theSanta Clara Valley mainly late in afternoon and the evenings. Surface winds enter the south part of the Santa Clara Valley via the CoyeteNarrows and pass through Pajaro Gap. Prevailing wind direction is fromthe north over most of the southern portion of the valley, with winds blowingmostly from the south just below Gilroy, due to the Pajaro Gap. In thevicinity of Gilroy, however, winds are variable, because the currents fromnorth and south meet there. Winter winds associated with the low pressurecyclonic storms which visit the region are more changeable in directionand velocity. Wind speeds are greatest during summer, when they averageten miles per hour. (c) Soils The soil associations present in the Santa Clara Valley are areas dominatedby very deep soils on alluvial plains, fans, stream benches and terraces.The soils most predominant in the Santa Clara Valley are the Yolo and Zamora-Arbuckle-PleasantonAssociations. The soils in the Santa Cruz Mountains to the east are Franciscan shalewhich is unique to this particular area south of San Francisco. The soilsof the Santa Cruz Mountains are basically residual materials from the decompositionof bedrock and the soil types in the area differ depending on the typeof underlying bedrock. Generally, these residual soils tend to be thinand stony, and somewhat excessively drained. This contrasts with the soilsof the Santa Clara Valley, which are primarily alluvium and more fertile.The soils of the Livermore Valley also differ from those of the Santa ClaraValley because they are gravelly as opposed to the gravel free Santa ClaraValley soils. (d) Physiology and Geology The Santa Clara Valley ranges in elevation from 100 to 800 feet above sealevel as compared with the Santa Cruz Mountains and Diablo Range whichsurround the valley on the west and east side, respectively. The SantaCruz Mountains elevation is approximately 1,000 to 3,500 feet above sealevel. The Diablo Range elevation averages approximately 1,000 to 3,500feet above sea level. The Santa Cruz Mountains are geologically differentthan the Santa Clara Valley because this mountain area is composed of formationsof granite, marble, sandstone, lava, quartzite and schist. The Santa Clara Valley floor consists chiefly of a number of confluentalluvial fans and flood plains formed by deposits from the numerous streamsthat enter the valley from both mountain systems. An imperceptible alluvialdivide at Morgan Hill separates the drainage of the valley into a north-flowingsystem and a south-flowing system. The former drains into San FranciscoBay at the north end of Santa Clara County, and the latter leads to thePajaro River south of Gilroy and eventually flows into Monterey Bay. The oldest rocks found within eastern Santa Clara Valley are the Franciscan-KnoxvilleGroup of Upper Jurassic age. These rocks form the largest single geologicunit in the area. Along the margins of the Santa Clara Valley, Pliocenestrata are exposed and the valley floor itself is composed of an accumulationof Quaternary clay, sand, and gravel. <ITAG tagnum="84">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking </ITAG>On February 4, 1988, Notice No. 653 was published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>with a 30-day comment period. In that notice,ATF invited comments regarding the proposal to establish ``Santa ClaraValley'' as an American viticultural area. ATF requested comments for theproposed name and boundaries for the Santa Clara Valley. ATF specificallyasked for comments on the proposed northern and southern boundaries. Nocomments were received during the 30-day comment period on the name SantaClara Valley or on the boundaries. <ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous </ITAG>ATF does not wish to give the impression by approving ``Santa Clara Valley''as a viticultural area that it is approving or endorsing the quality ofthe wine derived from this area. ATF is approving this area as being distinctand not better than other areas. By approving this viticultural area, wineproducers are allowed to claim a distinction on labels and advertisementsas to the origin of the grapes. Any commercial advantage gained can only come from consumer acceptanceof wines from ``Santa Clara Valley.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>The provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act relating to a final regulatoryflexibility analysis (5 U.S.C. 604) are not applicable to this final rulebecause it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. The final rule will not impose, or otherwisecause, a significant increase in reporting, recordkeeping, or other complianceburdens on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, it is herebycertified under the provisions of section 3 of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) that this final rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>In compliance with Executive Order 12291, ATF has determined that thisfinal rule is not a ``major rule'' since it will not result in: (a) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(b) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(c) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511,44 U.S.C.
