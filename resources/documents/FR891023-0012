Hawkins-RobertT. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988,Pub. L. 100-297. Principal themes of this new legislation are the promotionof access to quality education for educationally disadvantaged studentsand excellence in education for the Nation as a whole. In keeping with these themes, title I of the Hawkins-Stafford Act amendsthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to include anumber of new and reauthorized Federal education programs. One of theseprograms is Chapter 1 of title I of the ESEA, which reauthorizes programspreviously contained in chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and ImprovementAct of 1981 (ECIA). Subpart 1 of part D of Chapter 1, which these regulationsimplement, provides financial assistance to State educational agenciesto meet the special educational needs of migratory children of migratoryagricultural workers or migratory fishers. This assistance is providedto improve the educational opportunities of those children by helping themsucceed in the regular school program, attain grade-level proficiency,and improve their achievement in basic and more advanced skills. On January 26, 1989, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) for this program in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 3924). The preamble to the NPRM includeddiscussion of the provisions enacted by the Congress to strengthen andimprove the program. The preamble also included a summary of other significantchanges resulting from reauthorization. <ITAG tagnum="84">Major Changes from the NPRM </ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, the Department received4,829 letters from State and local educational agency officials, teachers,parents, students, organizations, and members of Congress. The commentsaddressed significant issues that concerned nearly all aspects of funding,planning, designing, implementing, and evaluating State programs and localprojects under this part. Many commenters expressed concern for what theyperceived as the NPRM's inadequate adaptation of general Chapter 1 statutoryrequirements to the special character and nature of the Migrant EducationProgram. Others objected to what appeared to them to be a proposal to transformthe program into one that operated at the local, rather than the State,level. Many commenters requested changes in the proposed regulations torectify these and other concerns so that, from their perspective, the finalregulations would be more appropriate for the Migrant Education Program.In these final regulations, the Secretary has considered these commentsand responded in ways that balance the concerns of State and local schoolofficials, parents, and others with the statutory purposes of the programand the needs of the migratory children to be served. The following sectionsprovide a brief summary of the final regulations that are significantlydifferent from the regulations proposed in the NPRM.Submission of a Project Application to the SEA (andSection; 201.17) As proposed, the regulations would have required, among other things, ageneral description of the project a local educational agency (LEA) wouldconduct. In keeping with the special character of the Migrant EducationProgram, and the statutory priority on statewide services to currentlymigratory children, the final regulations also require the LEA or otheroperating agency to provide separate narrative and budget information onservices needed to address the unmet needs of currently migratory childrenresiding within the area served by the project. The State educational agency(SEA) will use this information to ensure that the amount of its subgrantsthroughout the State (andSection; 201.25) is at least enough to pay the costof projects designed to meet the unmet needs of all significant concentrationsof currently migratory children. Other changes involved information regarding the LEA's compliance withthe maintenance of effort and comparability requirements. Section 201.17(c)(1)would have required the LEA annually to update its application by submittingdata showing it had maintained fiscal effort. In response to a numher ofcomments concerned with data burden, the regulations have been revisedto require submission of the data only if the SEA does not already havethat information. Furthermore, the proposed andSection; 201.18(a)(2) (Approval of a projectapplication for a subgrant) would have required that before it could approvean application for a subgrant, an SEA had to determine that the LEA's salarystructure, if implemented, would result in compliance with the comparabilityrequirement in andSection; 201.44. These regulations delete that provisionand instead require only that an LEA that applies for a subgrant underandSection; 201.17 have on file with the SEA a written assurance that ithas established and implemented district-wide salary schedules, which ensurethat migratory children will be provided comparable levels of servicesfrom State and local funds. Amount Available for an SEA Grant (andSection; 201.20) <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Proposed Changes in Summer School Adjustment </ITAG>There are two major changes concerning the amount available for a grant.First, the proposed regulations would have required a new two-tier systemfor making adjustments in the statistics the Migrant Student Record TransferSystem (MSRTS) generates for the Secretary on the number of migratory childrenestimated annually to reside in a State on the basis of the number of childrenenrolled in summer school programs. As proposed, children participatingin non-intensive instructional projects would have generated only halfthe supplemental residency credit as children participating in intensiveinstructional projects, with the definition of ``instructional'' projecttied to a minimum number of hours of daily or weekly instruction. Under section 1201 of the Act, the count of each State's migratory childrenaffects the size of its allocation of program funds and of the allocationof funds to each of the other States. Reactions to the Secretary's proposalwere varied and intense. Many felt that it did not sufficiently addressthe needs of SEAs that operate intensive summer school projects, principallyfor currently migratory children. Many others felt that the proposal wouldundermine innovative State summer programs that had proven worthwhile.Still others generally favored the proposal. Commenters on both sides favoredcaution and further study. In response to the comments, the Secretary haswithdrawn the proposed summer school formula rule so that the issue canbe further reviewed within the framework of developing one that is betterkeyed to the summer school needs of currently migratory children. The Secretaryanticipates that this effort will culminate in the publication of anotherproposed summer school adjustment formula. Until a new proposal is developed,the Department will maintain the current formula that assigns equal creditto all migratory children based on the number of days they are enrolledin any SEA summer school project. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Special Enrollment Procedures for Children Recruited at StopoverSites </ITAG>The proposed regulations also provided that children enrolled in MSRTSat stopover sites while they are en route to other locations could be enrolledas residents of the stopover State only for the limited period of residencyat the project site. Many commenters favored the proposal as a way to prevent States that operateprojects at stopover sites from reaping financial rewards through the allocationsystem, which credits the State for child residency if children recruitedat the sites are not recruited in the States to which they move. Othercommenters felt strongly that the stopover sites were being singled outunfairly since their recruitment and enrollment practices comport withthe nationwide system for assigning residency credit to each State, andthat the projects provided so many benefits that their continued fundingwas imperative. In response to comments, the Secretary has adopted theproposal in the final regulations, but with clarifying language that wouldlimit its applicability to situations in which the ``other locations''are in other States. In addition the Secretary intends, in consultation with and with the approvalof the States, to seek continued funding for the stopover site projectsthrough grants or contracts provided under section 1203 of the Act, theMigrant Education Coordination Program.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Five Percent Rate of Error in Eligibility Determinations </ITAG>The proposed regulations further provided that, for purposes of determiningState allocations, the data SEAs submit on their migratory children notexceed five percent of the total number of children the SEA identifiedas State residents. In response to a number of comments, the error rateprovision has been deleted from andSection; 201.20 but retained in andSection;201.30 with new language that clarifies that the SEA is responsible formonitoring its own determinations to ensure that the number of ineligiblestudents the SEA has enrolled in the MSRTS does not exceed a five percentmargin of error. Amount of Subgrant (andSection; 201.25) The proposed regulations would have required an SEA to emphasize, in calculatingthe amount of its LEA subgrants, the numbers and needs of currently migratorychildren whom the LEA would serve, and the costs of project activitiesthe LEA would implement to meet their needs. Many commenters objected toany special requirement that the needs of currently migratory childrenbe specifically considered in determining the amount of a subgrant. Whilerejecting the proposal that an SEA can legitimately tie the subgrant amountto the total number of migratory children, currently and formerly, whoreside in the project area, the Secretary has revised andSection; 201.25to permit an SEA flexibility in calculating subgrants, provided it hasensured that operating agencies in the State have sufficient funds to paythe costs of projects designed to meet the unmet needs of all significantconcentrations of the State's currently migratory children. Service Priorities (andSection; 201.31) The proposed regulations would have retained the existing requirement thatall currently migratory children be given priority over formerly migratorychildren in the receipt of all Migrant Education Program services. Commentersstated that the proposal imposed undesirable rigidity in the program byprecluding the provision of services to formerly migratory children withplainly greater needs than currently migratory children. In response, andSection;201.31 has been revised to repeat the statutory requirement that currentlymigratory children be given priority ``in consideration of programs andprojects'' that are offered to migrant students. This new provision isthen incorporated by reference into andSection; 201.32 (Annual needs assessment)to permit projects to be designed around these migratory children plainlyin greatest need. Annual Needs Assessment (andSection; 201.32) Many commenters stated that, as proposed, andSection; 201.32 inappropriatelyrequired that all migrant education projects assess needs on the basisof educationally related objective criteria even though, because of studentmobility and the kinds of summer school projects in which migrant studentsenroll, these forms of objective criteria cannot feasibly be used. In response,andSection; 201.32 reiterates that all projects assess needs on the basisof educationally related objective criteria, but projects serving currentlymigratory children do not have to rely upon the results of written or oraltests, if it is not reasonably possible to use them. In order to avoidthe need, in some projects, for constantly assessing individual student'sneeds, andSection; 201.31 also clarifies that projects that serve currentlymigratory children may assess needs only during periods of peak enrollment.State Rulemaking and Other SEA Responsibilities (andSection; 201.46) Many commenters interpreted proposed requirements in andSection; 201.46 onState rulemaking procedures and limitations as undermining the MigrantEducation Program as a State-operated program. Commenters expressed strongreservations about the new authority they believed the regulations gaveto individual LEAs over operation of the program. While the proposed regulationsstemmed from section 1451 of the Act, which applies on its face to allChapter 1 programs, commenters argued that the proposed regulations werefar more prescriptive than appropriate in view of the requirement in section1202(a)(3) of the Act that only the provision's ``basic objectives'' shouldapply to the Migrant Education Program. As proposed, andSection; 201.46(c) did provide that the limitations on Staterulemaking would apply unless State regulations or policies are neededto implement SEA responsibilities in the approved State application, theChapter 1 statute, or program regulations. The Secretary believes that,as drafted, this exception to the section 1451 limitations was sufficientto permit SEAs to continue operating the Migrant Education Program, unimpeded,as a State-operated program. However, andSection; 201.46 has been furthermodified to clarify the applicability of the section 1451 limitations onlyto matters that the SEA, which by law operates the State's migrant educationprograms and projects, has reserved for LEA decisionmaking. Evaluation (andSection;andSection; 201.51 Through 201.56) While recognizing the special nature of migratory student population, theproposed regulations would have required specific and detailed evaluationassessments and data collection procedures very similar to those requiredof LEAs for their basic chapter 1 program. In response to comments, theregulations concerning evaluation have been revised to provide greaterflexibility in measuring the educational progress of migratory students.For example, they permit instructional projects serving students enrolledthroughout the school year to use the results of national or State normedachievement tests without regard to an appropriate non-project comparisongroup. For other projects, while use of a non-project comparison groupis still necessary, use of testing instruments is only required if it isfeasible to do so. Applicability of EDGAR (andSection; 201.2) In order to provide additional guidance and to ensure that Chapter 1 fundsare spent only for authorized program purposes, the Secretary proposedto make certain provisions of the Education Department General AdministrativeRegulations (EDGAR) applicable to programs under this part and has determinedthat in the final regulations those provisions will apply to programs underthis part. In determining which provisions of EDGAR will apply, the Secretary carefullybalanced the need for basic program accountability with the important principleof minimum Federal interference in State and local affairs. In particular,the final regulations allow States to use their own procedures to ensureaccountability with respect to matters governed by two Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) circulars: A-102 (Uniform Administrative Requirementsfor Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments),currently codified for programs of the Department of Education in 34 CFRpart 80; and A-87 (Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Grantsand Contracts with State and Local Governments) as amended on January 28,1981. Only if a State chooses not to apply its own procedures would theprovisions in these circulars apply to the Chapter 1_Migrant EducationProgram. If a State wishes to use its own procedures instead of those in the twoOMB circulars as implemented in EDGAR, its procedures must meet the threegeneral criteria in andSection; 201.2(a)(4). The State's procedures do nothave to be submitted to the Secretary for approval, but must be availablefor Federal inspection. If a State did not implement its own written requirementsby July 1, 1989, but wishes to develop them, the requirements in part 80will apply until the State's written requirements are adopted. In the eventa State's requirements are determined to be insufficient, the enforcementprovisions in part E of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) apply,including the due process provisions in that part. The Secretary wishes to emphasize that States have complete discretion,provided they meet the general criteria in andSection; 201.2, to use theirown procedures instead of the procedures in the two OMB circulars. Moreover,Circular A-102 has recently been revised to permit States to apply theirown procedures to implement that circular, thereby giving them considerableflexibility in determining appropriate standards for accountability atthe local level. Circular A-87 is currently being revised. In addition, the final regulations make applicable specified provisionsin part 76 (State-Administered Programs); part 77 (Definitions that Applyto Department Regulations); part 78 (Education Appeal Board); part 79 (IntergovernmentalReview of Department of Education Programs and Activities); part 81 (GeneralEducation Provisions Act_Enforcement); and part 85 (Governmentwide Debarmentand Suspension (Nonprocurement) and Governmentwide Requirements for Drug-FreeWorkplace (Grants)). Parts 79 and 85 were inadvertently omitted from theNPRM for this program. The Secretary believes that these regulations arethe minimum necessary for ensuring basic accountability without imposingundue paperwork and additional administrative burdens on SEAs and LEAs.Several of the applicable provisions in part 76 contain cross-referencesto 34 CFR part 74, which was superseded by part 80 on October 1, 1988 withrespect to State and local governments. The outdated cross-references inpart 76 to part 74 (now part 80) are not intended to make any provisionsof part 80 applicable to programs under this part that a State has not,on its own, decided to apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">Technical Amendments to Parts 200 and 203 </ITAG>The regulations in part 200 (Chapter 1 Program in Local Educational Agencies)and part 203 (Chapter 1 Program for Neglected or Delinquent Children) areamended to reflect the applicability of part 85 (Governmentwide Debarmentand Suspension (Nonprocurement) and Governmentwide Requirements for Drug-FreeWorkplace (Grants)). A discussion of how part 85 applies to these programsis included in the appendix to these regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes </ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 4,829 parties submittedcomments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and ofthe changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM is publishedas an appendix to these final regulations. Substantive issues are discussedunder the section of the regulations to which they pertain. Technical andother minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legallyauthorized to make under the applicable statutory authority_are not addressed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in the order. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12606 </ITAG>The Secretary certifies that these regulations have been reviewed in accordancewith Executive Order 12606 and that they do not have a significant negativeimpact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being. To thecontrary, the Chapter 1_Migrant Education Program supports and strengthensthe family by containing strong parental involvement requirements. Specifically,an SEA and its LEAs must develop, in coordination with parents of participatingchildren in regular school year programs, activities and procedures to:inform parents about the Chapter 1_Migrant Education Program; support theefforts of parents, including training parents to work with their childrenat home; train teachers and other staff to work effectively with parents;consult with parents on an ongoing basis; and provide opportunities forthe full participation of parents who lack the literacy skills or whosenative language is not English. Migrant Education Program funds may beused to support these activities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Review </ITAG>This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 andthe regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective of the Executive Orderis to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalismby relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordinationand review of proposed Federal financial assistance. In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide earlynotification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking </ITAG>These regulations include amendments to final regulations in 34 CFR part200 (Chapter 1 Program in Local Educational Agencies) and 34 CFR part 203(Chapter 1 Program for Neglected or Delinquent Children) referencing theapplicability of 34 CFR part 85 (Governmentwide Debarment and Suspension(Nonprocurement) and Governmentwide Requirements for Drug-Free Workplace(Grants)) to those parts. These amendments were not published with thenotice of proposed rulemaking. In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education ProvisionsAct (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.551 <T3>et seq.</T3>), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interestedparties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, part85 applies to parts 200 and 203 as a matter of law. Therefore, the Secretaryhas determined, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that proposed rulemaking on theamendments to andSection;andSection; 200.5 and 203.5 is unnecessary and contraryto the public interest. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>34 CFR Part 200 Administrative practice and procedure, Elementary and secondary education,State-administered programs. 34 CFR Part 201 Children, Coordination, Education, Eligibility, Evaluation, Grant programs_education,Identification and recruitment, Local educational agencies, Migrant studentrecord transfer system, Migratory children, Migratory workers, Needs assessment,Priorities, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Special educationalneeds, State educational agencies, Subgrants. 34 CFR Part 203 Education of disadvantaged, Juvenile delinquency, Neglected.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 13, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lauro F.

L. 100-297). <ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix_Analysis of Comments and Changes </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">General Comments </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Commenters generally expressed concern about two aspects of the proposedpart 201 regulations. First, many commenters believed that proposed regulationsdid not adequately take into account the special characteristics and natureof the Migrant Education Program that make it different from the regularChapter 1 Program in LEAs. These commenters objected particularly to whatthey considered to be a failure to properly interpret the statutory requirementin section 1202(a)(3) of the Act that migrant education programs and projects``be administered and carried out in a manner consistent with the basicobjectives of section 1011 (other than subsection (b)), sections 1012,1014, and 1018, and subpart 2 of part F.'' They considered the proposedregulations, in adopting conforming language from proposed regulationsfor the Chapter 1 Program in LEAs (34 CFR part 200) to be overly detailedin ways that did not consider differences between the two Chapter 1 programs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Many commenters also expressed strong concern that, in various respects,the proposed regulations appeared to transform the Migrant Education Programfrom one that has always been State-operated and -administered to one thatwas increasingly LEA-operated and   -administered. Commenters singled outfor criticism the State rulemaking provisions in proposed andSection; 201.46.That provision, derived from section 1451 of the Act, whose ``basic objectives''apply to the Migrant Education Program by virtue of section 1202(a)(3)of the Act, was nearly identical to the comparable provision proposed in34 CFR 200.70 of the October 21, 1988 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)for the Chapter 1 Program in LEAs. Although it contained the statutorylimitations on the authority of SEAs unilaterally to establish rules orpolicies, paragraph (e) of the proposed andSection; 201.46 expressly precludedthe applicability of those limitations if the SEA was acting to ``reviewand approve an LEA's or operating agency's application or to ensure thatthe use of Chapter 1_Migrant Education Program funds is in accordance withapplicable requirements.'' Commenters provided no comment on andSection;201.46(e), but objected to the other requirements as inconsistent withthe Migrant Education Program as State-operated and -administered. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>In responding to these and other comments, the Secretaryhas paid particular attention to the special nature and character of theMigrant Education Program as a program intended to be State-operated and-administered, and designed to serve a unique population of educationallydeprived children. Specific regulatory issues are discussed in the followingsection-by-section analysis. However, the Secretary first offers the followinganalytic framework surrounding the overriding issues of (1) treatment ofthe ``basic objectives'' language in the Act, (2) differences between theChapter 1_Migrant Education Program and the Chapter 1 Program in LEAs,and (3) the relationship between section 1451 of the Act and the MigrantEducation Program, that guided consideration of the comments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. <T3>The link between requirements governing the Migrant Education Programand the ``basic objectives'' of specified requirements governing the Chapter1 Program in LEAs. </T3>Congress has offered no guidance on what it considersto be the ``basic,'' rather than the ``secondary'' objectives. The Secretarytherefore has not attempted to define the ``basic objectives'' of eachapplicable statutory provision in sections 1011, 1012, 1014, 1018 and subpart2 of part F of the Act that are linked by section 1202(a)(3) of the Actto the Migrant Education Program, believing that this effort will quicklylead to an intractable quagmire. In order to address the responsibilitiesof SEAs and operating agencies with regard to the ``basic objectives''of those statutory provisions, the Secretary instead has determined thatthese regulations should interpret those applicable requirements in waysthat make sense for the Migrant Education Program, given its special character.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. <T3>Differences between the Migrant Education Program and the Chapter 1Program in LEAs. </T3>In adapting provisions governing the Chapter 1 Programin LEAs to the Migrant Education Program, the Secretary considered themajor differences between the target populations for the two groups andthe ways the two programs are conducted. These differences are interrelated,and are reflected in many of the regulations governing the administrationand operation of migrant education programs and projects. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Characteristics of participating children: </T3>The Chapter 1 Programin LEAs serves educationally deprived children who reside in low-incomeareas. These children generally participate in supplemental Chapter 1 programsfor which they have been selected on the basis of certain educationallyrelated objective criteria concerning their academic performance. In thecourse of a year, some of these children may move to another attendancearea in either the same school district or another school district. However,regardless of its importance to individual children, their transiency isnot a factor in either their selection to participate in the Chapter 1Program in LEAs or the design of projects to meet their needs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On the other hand, children who participate in the Migrant EducationProgram are selected because they have moved between school districts (forreasons related to the migratory employment of a family member) and havespecial educational needs that may arise as a result of those moves. Thesefactors, combined with the statutory priority, in section 1202(b) of theAct, that currently migratory children be given priority ``in the considerationof programs and activities,'' combine to create differences in the waysthat the two programs operate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Moreover, programs operated under the Migrant Education Program, unlikethose operated under the Chapter 1 Program in LEAs, must be designed aroundthe differences among migratory children. For example, some currently migratorychildren may move across school district boundaries one or more times duringthe regular school term, and so need programs that are designed to meetspecial educational needs tied to the effects of both school disruptionand their families' migratory and employment experiences. Other currentlymigratory children may move either over the summer when the regular schoolterm is not in session or near the beginning or end of regular school terms,and so need programs that are designed to meet special educational needstied to their families' migratory and employment experiences, but not directlyto any school disruption. Formerly migratory children experience no immediateschool disruption. However, some may need programs that address educationalneeds similar to those of currently migratory children, while others maybe sufficiently removed from the effects of previous migrations to be withoutneed of special Migrant Education Program services. Program regulationsmust be sufficiently flexible to ensure that migrant education projectscan adequately address the varying needs of these and other migratory children.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Duration and Location of Projects:</T3> Related to the population servedis the duration and location of local programs. Projects and activitiesfunded by the Chapter 1 Program in LEAs operate in a cohesive way in onelocation over the course of the entire school year, including summers.Many SEAs operate migrant education projects whose principal, if not sole,components are summer projects that try to complement the regular schoolprograms operated in other locations from which currently migratory students,who may appear without warning, have moved. Moreover, SEAs may operatethese projects in areas that normally do not have a regular summer schoolprogram. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Assessing Student Performance:</T3> The two programs also differ significantlyin terms of the ease with which students' needs and performance can berecorded and assessed. Projects that serve populations of mobile childrenwho enroll and withdraw at different times may encounter more problemsthan others in utilizing what otherwise would be standard means of determiningneeds and measuring gains. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>SEA Responsibilities:</T3> Unlike the Chapter 1 Program in LEAs, theMigrant Education Program by statute is State-operated and -administered.The SEA bears responsibility in the Migrant Education Program for coordinatingprojects throughout the State that serve children migrating from placeto place, and ensuring that appropriate projects exist to meet the needsof migratory children on a statewide basis. While the SEA typically utilizesthe resources of LEAs and other local operating agencies to assist it inoperating migrant education projects, it retains responsibility for theadministration, implementation, and operation of all migrant educationprojects in the State. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. <T3>The issue of continued SEA control over the State migrant educationprogram presented by section 1451 of the Act.</T3> Although the MigrantEducation Program is State-operated, section 1451 of the Act places somelimitations on the SEA's authority to direct unilaterally all aspects ofits migrant education programs and projects. In particular, while section1451(a)(1) contains general authority for States to issue regulations thatare not inconsistent with Federal requirements, section 1451(a)(2) expresslystates: ``(2) State rules or policies may not limit local school districts'decisions regarding the grade levels to be served; the basic skills areas(such as reading, mathematics, or language arts) to be addressed; instructionalsettings, materials, or teaching techniques to be used; instructional staffto be employed (as long as such staff meet State certification and licensingrequirements for educational personnel); or other essential support services(such as counseling and other pupil personnel services) to be providedas part of the programs authorized under this chapter.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Furthermore, section 1451(b) specifically provides that ``[b]eforepublication of any proposed or final State rule or regulation pursuantto this chapter, each such rule shall be reviewed by a State committeeof practitioners * * *.'' Both paragraphs (a)(2) and (b) explicitly referto their applicability to all programs under ``this chapter'' and so applyto the Migrant Education Program. While section 1202(a)(3) of the Act providesthat migrant education programs and projects must ``be administered andcarried out in a manner consistent with the basic objectives of'' section1451, the Secretary is bound by the express language of section 1451 togive that provision applicability to the Migrant Education Program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As the discussion of specific comments on proposed andSection; 201.46explains, the Secretary has sought to reconcile the special nature of theState-operated Migrant Education Program with the strictures imposed bysection 1451(a)(2) by focusing on what, under the program, are construedto be LEA decisions and what are construed to be SEA decisions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Modifications to the proposed regulations are noted followingthe discussion of each specific comment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 201.3 Definitions for this Program </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommended that the definition of ``migratoryagricultural worker'' specify that both dairy work and poultry processingare agricultural activities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The definition of a ``migratory agricultural worker''includes persons who move across school district boundaries to enable themto obtain temporary or seasonal employment in an agricultural activity``including dairy work.'' Dairy work was included in the proposed regulationsin response to sections 1201(a), 1202(b)(1), and 1202(b)(5) of the Act,in which Congress expressly provides that the Migrant Education Programmeet the special educational needs of children of migratory agriculturaldairy workers. Congress did not specifically address poultry processing.However, that activity (like dairy work) is already considered to be an``agricultural activity'' under andSection; 201.3(b)(1), so no correspondingchange in the existing definition of ``migratory agricultural worker''is necessary for poultry processing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> Three widely varying comments were received regardingthat part of the definition of ``currently migratory child'' that requiresa ``move.'' One commenter urged the Department to define a ``move'' asestablishing residency in the new location, so that children whose onlymove across school district boundaries occurs on weekends could no longerbe recruited as migrant children. Another commenter believed that sincethe term ``move'' already entailed establishment of a new residence, andchildren passing through stopover sites did not establish residency atthem, compliance with the definition would eliminate any need for a rule,like that proposed in andSection; 201.20(a)(3), to limit the residency daysStates accrue on behalf of children recruited at those sites. The thirdcommenter simply recommended that the word ``move'' not be defined in regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary is aware of isolated situations in whichchildren have qualified for participation in the Migrant Education Programsolely because they have traveled with their parents away from their permanentresidence for very brief and infrequent weekend (or holiday) periods. Whilesome may interpret the current regulatory definitions as entailing establishmentof a new residence, the definitions do not differentiate between the movesof weekend or overnight duration or overnight situations of children thecommenters described, and the moves of children who travel from their homesfor long periods of time. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The regulations do not define a move. Nor, despite the second commenter'sopinion, do they contain standards for determining how brief inter-districtmoves that have little connection with conditions of migrancy, might justifyprecluding particular children from eligibility for the Migrant EducationProgram. Rather, the regulations permit any child to be counted and servedby the Migrant Education Program for up to six full years (one as a currentlymigratory child and five as a formerly migratory child) provided only thathe or she has made at least one move, regardless of duration, across schooldistrict boundaries to enable the child, or child's parent or guardian,to obtain temporary or seasonal employment in an agricultural or fishingactivity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary agrees with the first commenter that the lack of a regulatorydefinition of ``move'' creates the potential for abuse. Children who travelaway from home only for brief and infrequent intervals, such as occasionalweekends, encounter little, if any, disruption in their lives or education.Still, program definitions permit them to be counted and served by theMigrant Education Program for up to six years in the same manner as childrenwho suffer the tangible effects of migratory lifestyles, thereby divertingservices and resources from programs for truly migratory children. Moreover,under the statutory formula in section 1201(b) of the Act for allocatingMigrant Education Program funds, these children will generate the sameamounts of program funding for their States as will children who encounterserious and lengthy dislocations. Given these factors, the need existsto articulate reasonable minimum standards for determining when brief andinfrequent moves would be non-qualifying. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Nevertheless, the NPRM did not propose to define the term ``move,''because section 1202(c) of the Act requires the Secretary to continue touse the existing regulatory definition of ``currently migratory child.''This definition refers simply to the need for a ``move'' to be made acrossschool district or, in States comprising a single school district, administrativearea boundaries. While the Secretary has not previously regulated on theallowable minimum duration of a ``move,'' section 1202(c) does not necessarilypreclude the Secretary from protecting the Migrant Education Program'sintegrity by interpreting the word ``move'' in such a way as to withholdeligibility from those with little connection with migrancy. However, theMay 1988 proposal offered by the Office of Migrant Education, in draftnonregulatory guidance, to establish a minimum duration for a qualifyingmove or series of moves engendered widespread criticism from State officialsand others who claimed the proposed non-mandatory guidance was both administrativelycumbersome and inconsistent with the statutory freeze on the existing definitions.Given the intensity of this response, the Secretary is not now preparedto regulate in this area without a clearer direction from Congress thatthe Secretary should do so. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked whether the existing broad definitionof ``move'' applied even in the case of preschool children who either mightnot yet be attending school or might be attending the same Head Start orother preschool program even after making a move across school districtboundaries. The commenter noted that these children did not suffer anyeducational disruption, and so perhaps should not be eligible to be consideredas currently migratory children. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>Under the program definitions in andSection; 201.3,which Congress froze by virtue of section 1202(a) of the Act, a child whohas moved between school districts may be counted and served as a currentlymigratory child even if the child suffers no educational disruption asa result of the move. Presumably, if a preschool child either had no educationalneed or had needs that were already being met, the State educational agency(SEA) would not spend Migrant Education Program funds on the child's account.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that the Secretary define theterms ``temporary employment'' and ``seasonal employment'' as they areused in the definition of a ``currently migratory child.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>An Office of Migrant Education proposal to expandits existing interpretations of these terms was included in its May 1988and January 1989 drafts of new nonregulatory guidance. Any final interpretationswill be included in the policy manual that the Secretary will issue pursuantto section 1436 of the Act. In view of the many varieties of temporaryor seasonal employment, the Secretary believes that the policy manual,rather than regulations, is the appropriate vehicle for providing non-bindingdefinitions of temporary or seasonal employment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 201.10 Eligibility of an SEA to Participate as a Grantee </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1201(a) of the Act specifically permits anSEA to operate its State's migrant education program through LEAs and,as proposed, andSection; 201.10 would have continued to authorize the SEAto make subgrants only to LEAs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary does not believe that the Congress intended to precludean SEA from operating its migrant education program through non-LEA operatingagencies that in particular situations may be better equipped than LEAsto meet the needs of migratory children. As a result, because there isno reason to distinguish in the subgrant process between an LEA and anyother operating agency, the Secretary has determined that andSection; 201.10should expressly permit an SEA to make subgrants with both LEAs and non-LEAoperating agencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>Section 201.10 has been modified accordingly. Consistentwith this change, andSection;andSection; 201.16 (Documents that an operatingagency must submit to apply for a subgrant), 201.17 (Submission of a projectapplication to the SEA), 201.18 (Approval of a project application fora subgrant), and other appropriate portions of these regulations have alsobeen changed so that they apply to any local operating agency that appliesfor or receives a subgrant from the SEA. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 201.11 Documents an SEA Must Submit to Receive a Grant </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that proposed andSection; 201.11(b)(2),which requires the SEA's application to include an assurance regardingthe circumstances under which preschool children ``may'' be served, appearsto conflict with section 1202(a)(5) of the Act, which requires the applicationto contain an assurance that provision ``will be made'' for the preschooleducational needs of migrant children. Despite the apparently mandatorylanguage of the statute, the commenter recommended retention of the permissivelanguage proposed in andSection; 201.11(b)(2) in order to give State andlocal program administrators greater flexibility in determining how MigrantEducation Program services should be distributed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1202 (a)(5) of the Act requires each SEA applicationto contain an adequate assurance that ``in planning and carrying out programsand projects'' for migratory children, ``provision will be made for thepreschool needs of migratory children.''

Congress thereby has required that the uses of MigrantEducation Program funds be shifted, to some extent, from addressing thecontinuing educational needs of school-aged formerly migrant children toaddressing the needs of currently migratory children, ages 3 through 5,for ``educational'' services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While the Secretary does not believe the regulations need to reflectan expansive definition of the term ``preschool educational needs,'' theSecretary considers the statutory phrase ``educational needs'' to encompassneeds for both child development and day care services. However, SEAs neednot use Migrant Education Program funds to support preschool programs thatprovide these services for children who (1) have no special educationalneeds, (2) have needs that are being met through programs funded from othersources, or (3) pursuant to andSection; 201.36 (General program requirements),do not reside in concentrations large enough to permit a project ``of sufficientsize, scope, and quality to give reasonable promise of substantial progresstoward meeting'' the preschool needs of the children whom the project wouldserve. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 201.17 Submission of a Project Application to the SEA </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> A number of commenters objected to what they consideredto be excessive and unwarranted detail in the proposed regulations governingthe content of local educational agency (LEA) applications for subgrants(andSection; 201.17(b)). The commenters noted that the proposed applicationrequirements conform closely to those contained in section 1012(b) of theAct without allowance for the special nature of the Migrant Education Program.While these statutory requirements in section 1012(b) are directly applicableto the Chapter 1 Program in LEAs, the commenters asserted that section1202(a)(3) of the Act requires only that migrant education programs andprojects be administered ``consistent with the basic objectives'' of section1012. One commenter noted, for example, that while proposed andSection; 201.17(b)(1)(i)required a project application to contain a description of program goalsestablished to meet the needs of children ``in greatest need,'' migranteducation programs as a matter of first priority must serve the needs ofcurrently migratory children, even if formerly migratory children are ingreater need for assistance. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, some commenters expressed the belief that proposed andSection;201.17 focused too heavily on the local rather than the State level. Thesecommenters argued that since the Migrant Education Program is a State-administeredrather than a locally-administered program, section 1202(a)(3) of the Actshould make the ``basic objectives'' of section 1012 applicable at theState rather than the local level. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> In addressing these comments, the Secretary has focusedupon two principal questions. These are (1) whether SEA administrationof the Migrant Education Program requires minimum standards for the contentof subgrant applications, and (2) if so, how section 1012(b) of the Actshould affect that content. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. <T3>The need for regulations to address minimum requirements for applicationsthat seek Migrant Education Program subgrants.</T3> Unlike the Chapter1 program in LEAs, the Chapter 1 Migrant Education Program is State-operatedand -administered. Section 1201(a) of the Act authorizes SEAs to operatemigrant education programs either directly or through subgrants to LEAs(interpreted by the Secretary to include local operating agencies), andnearly all SEAs elect to do the latter. While the SEAs retain responsibilityfor these local migrant education projects, staff of local operating agencies(usually LEAs) plan, implement, and evaluate the local projects, and spendprogram funds_just as they do in the Chapter 1 program in LEAs. The Secretarybelieves that the Congress intended for SEAs, in administering their migranteducation programs, to review the same kinds of information that section1012 requires an LEA to include in its application under the Chapter 1Program in LEAs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Sound programmatic management requires the same result. Given thecommon two-tier manner of operating a State's migrant education programsand projects, an SEA cannot effectively administer those programs and projectsunless LEAs that desire subgrants submit to it applications that containuniform information with which the SEA can ensure that subgrantees willproperly operate migrant education projects on its behalf. Since nearlyall of these operating agencies also participate in the Chapter 1 Programin LEAs, the Secretary believes it is reasonable that their applicationsfor migrant education subgrants adapt the applicable requirements in section1012(b) of the Act governing entitlement grants under the Chapter I Programin LEAs. Indeed, without knowledge that SEAs are reviewing subgrant applicationsthat contain at least these kinds of information, the Secretary cannotreview SEA applications submitted under section 1202 of the Act, and beable to determine that the SEA's programs will be administered and carriedout in a manner consistent with the basic objectives of applicable provisionsof the Chapter 1 statute. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the Secretary rejects the suggestion that, for the MigrantEducation Program, the provisions in section 1012(b) have no applicabilityat the LEA level. Rather, the Secretary has determined that andSection; 201.17(b)should reflect the information relevant to this program that correspondsto the information that section 1012(b) of the Act requires under the Chapter1 Program in LEAs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. <T3>Adaptation of the LEA application requirements in section 1012 to requirementsfor applications for Migrant Education Program subgrants.</T3> The Secretaryagrees with the concerns of some commenters that andSection; 201.17(b) shouldbe revised so that the specific content of section 1012 of the Act is adaptedto the Migrant Education Program. In keeping with the differences betweenthe Chapter 1_Migrant Education Program and the Chapter 1 Program in LEAs,identified at the outset of this Appendix, the final regulations have beenmodified in several respects so that LEA applications contain informationthat specifically addresses the migrant education projects the LEA proposesto implement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In particular, the Secretary has determined that to ensure that theStatewide needs of currently migratory children are given priority, theSEA must be able to review an LEA subgrant application that contains aseparate description of the activities and level of funding that wouldsupport programs for currently migratory children the LEA expects to serve.As noted in the discussion of comments on andSection; 201.25(b) (Amount availablefor an LEA subgrant), the proposal that an SEA tie the amount of an LEA'ssubgrant to the numbers of currently migratory children it would serveand the costs of activities needed to serve them has been revised. Section201.25(b) requires only that the SEA ensure that LEAs have sufficient fundsto meet the unmet needs of currently migratory children residing in areasthey would serve. Because the SEA cannot do so without Statewide informationon the expected activities and the costs of those activities LEAs wouldimplement to meet the needs of currently migratory children, the Secretaryhas determined that this information must be included in any applicationfor a Migrant Education Program subgrant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> The Secretary has made several changes to proposed andSection;202.17(b). First, paragraph (b)(2) now requires an operating agency applicationto contain information, ``consistent with the SEA's approved application''(rather than ``section 1012(b) of Chapter 1'' as the NPRM had proposed),about (i) the operating agency's needs assessments and children with thegreatest needs, consistent with the priority favoring currently migratorychildren, and (ii) the design of proposed projects and how they would meetthe general instructional program goals the SEA has established. Second,andSection; 201.17(b)(1)(ii) requires a breakdown of the components thatwould serve the identified unmet needs of currently migratory childrenexpected to participate and the numbers of those children. Similarly, thebudget of the project's expenditures required by andSection; 201.27(b)(2)must contain a separate summary of project components that would servecurrently migratory children.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Furthermore, the applicant's assurances described in paragraph (b)(3)have been changed from the LEA assurances in section 1012(c) of Chapter1 to assurances that programs have been planned and will be operated ina manner consistent with andSection;andSection; 201.35 and 201.36 of theseregulations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned the advisability of permittingLEAs that operate short-term summer projects to submit three-year applicationsunder andSection; 201.17(a). The commenter observed that the LEA cannot knowfrom year to year whether the same students or numbers of students willreturn to the LEA each year, and so presumably cannot adequately plan projectsfor the three-year period. The commenter recommended that only the SEA'sapplication to the Secretary be permitted to cover a three-year period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> In applying the basic objectives of section 1012 ofthe Act to the Migrant Education Program, the Secretary is adhering tothe overall congressional statement of policy, recited in section 1011(a)of the Act, that Chapter 1 eliminate unnecessary administrative burdens.Since even those LEAs that operate only the kind of summer projects thecommenter described may be able to eliminate some duplicative paperworkby submitting three-year applications, the Secretary believes that andSection;201.17(a) should continue to permit any LEA to submit an application ofup to three years. Moreover, the Secretary is satisfied that the requirementsin andSection; 201.17(c) (for annual LEA updating of its application) andthat in andSection; 201.17(b)(5) (that the LEA include in its applicationinformation the SEA needs to ensure the local project comports with theapproved State application) adequately meet the commenter's concerns. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>In section 1202(a)(3) of the Act, Congress reemphasizedthat migrant education programs and projects must be administered and carriedout in ways that meet the basic objectives of the maintenance of effortand comparability provisions in section 1028.

Section 201.17(b)(5) has been amended to require the LEAto include in its application data from which the SEA can determine thatthe LEA has maintained fiscal effort.

Because section 1202(a)(3) of theAct incorporates the basic objectives of that provision as a Migrant EducationProgram requirement, an LEA seeking funds must provide in its subgrantapplication the corresponding assurance of comparability the Secretaryhas established in andSection; 201.44(b). That assurance covers the situationthe commenter has described. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The intent of andSection; 201.18(a)(2)(ii), as proposed, was to providethe SEA the information it needed prior to approving the LEA's application,thereby minimizing the LEA's risk of subsequently being found in noncompliancewith the comparability requirement.

Section 1018(c)of the Act states that an LEA shall be considered to have met the comparableservices requirement if it files with the SEA the appropriate written assurance.Since an LEA that received a Migrant Education Program subgrant must complywith the comparable services requirement in andSection; 201.44, and the SEAmust monitor the LEA's compliance with it, the Secretary has determinedthat andSection; 201.18(a)(2)(ii) should be revised. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Section 201.18(a)(2) has been revised accordingly. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> As proposed, andSection; 201.18(a)(1) provided thatan SEA could approve an LEA's subgrant application that complied with theChapter 1 statute, applicable regulations, and the provisions of the approvedSEA application.

Someasserted that nothing in Public Law 100-297 supported the Secretary's proposalto alter the way in which the size of State grants should be determined.Many commenters claimed that the proposal inappropriately singled out forspecial treatment these ``stopover'' project sites. Commenters argued thatunder the MSRTS computer program for calculating each State's total ofmigrant child residency days (the Migrant Program Allocation Subsystem(MPAS)), no State is held responsible for determining and documenting whenchildren leave their States. Commenters also claimed that the Secretary'sproposal that States provide the MSRTS a ``termination date'' for childrenenrolled at a stopover site amounted to an improper effort to establishadditional eligibility criteria. Many commenters claimed that their effortto monitor the dates children leave particular States would create excessiveadministrative burden, and violate the prohibition in section 1202(c) ofthe Act against expanding the definition of a ``currently migratory child''in existing regulations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Many commenters also stressed the substantial benefits that the projectsat stopover sites provide. First, migrant children who pass through themreceive supplemental education and health services and information aboutprojects at their next destinations. Second, States that are the children'sultimate destinations could learn of the anticipated date and locationof the family's arrival. Third, the overall fairness of the program's allocationprocess is improved. These commenters expressed serious concern about thecontinued viability of the migrant education projects located at stopoversites, should the Secretary adopt the proposed rule, and the correspondingharm that would befall the Migrant Education Program as a whole if proposedandSection; 201.20(a)(3) were adopted. One commenter recommended that theSecretary continue to fund these projects, but do so from funds Congressappropriates for the separate migrant interstate and intrastate coordinationprogram under section 1203 of the Act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Commenters who favored the Secretary's proposal did not question thebenefits that these very short-term projects provide. However, they agreedthat SEAs operating them should not be able to generate inflated FTE countsthrough the existing MPAS when they know that the children whom they recruitwill immediately be proceeding to destinations in other States. Indeed,a number of commenters argued that the Secretary's proposal did not gofar enough. One commenter observed that ``receiving States'' had a markeddisadvantage over both ``stopover States'' and ``home States'' in identifyingand enrolling migratory children within their borders. Therefore, in keepingwith the national focus of the Migrant Education Program, this commenterrecommended that each child enrolled by a stopover State generate an automatic20-day period of enrollment in the State of the child's destination, andthe corresponding additional allocation of program funds, within whichtime the receiving State would work to find and recruit the child. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Three commenters argued that the proposal was far too narrow. Theyurged the Secretary to address the fundamental problem with the methodthe Department had adopted for allocating Migrant Education Program fundsunder section 1201(b) of the Act, which they characterized as the unreasonableassumption that a child's residency in one State continues until he orshe is identified and recruited elsewhere. One of the commenters urgedthe Secretary to replace the current method of allocating program fundson the basis of residency days with a system for distributing program fundson the basis of the numbers of migratory children, depending on age, whoattend schools or projects in the State for at least one day. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary proposed andSection; 201.20(a)(3) to resolvea significant and longstanding inconsistency between (1) the statisticson the numbers of migratory children residing in States with stopover sites,upon which the Department has relied in distributing Migrant EducationProgram funds, and (2) the statutory requirement, re-enacted in section1201(b) of the Act, that those statistics provide the most accurate estimateof the total of FTE migratory children who annually reside in each State.See the Supplementary Information accompanying the published NPRM (54 FR3926). After considering all the public comment, the Secretary has determinedto retain the proposal, but with modifications as explained in the Secretary'sdiscussion of the succeeding set of comments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. <T3>The current method for annually calculating each State's total of FTEmigrant children residing within its boundaries. </T3>For many years, inconsultation with the State Directors of Migrant Education, the Departmenthas allocated Chapter 1_Migrant Education Program funds to States on thebasis of FTE residency data generated by the MSRTS through operation ofthe MPAS. Under the MPAS, as soon as a child is identified as migratoryand enrolled in the MSRTS, the State enrolling the child begins to accrueresidency credit on his or her account as of the day the child was foundto begin residing in the State. That State will continue to receive residencycredit on account of the child for one year unless, before then, (1) anotherState enrolls the child as a ``currently migratory child'' residing withinthat State, or (2) the MSRTS ``terminates'' the child's enrollment. Atpresent, MSRTS might terminate a child's enrollment for reasons that include(a) the child's completion of five years as a ``formerly migrant child''without any recorded, intervening moves that would make him or her onceagain a ``currently migratory child,'' (b) the child's becoming 22 yearsof age, (3) its receipt of information that the child has graduated fromhigh school, or (4) its receipt of information that the child has died.The MPAS does not process information that a child has merely left a Stateand resides elsewhere, and neither the Department nor MSRTS staff haveever advised State and local project officials to provide the MSRTS withthis information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. <T3>The problem of recruitment at the stopover sites. </T3>The projectsites, which proposed andSection; 201.20(a)(3) was intended to address, arethose that assist migrant families who are in transit to destinations inother States, by offering them short-term educational, health, counseling,or other services. While the families are at the sites, often only overnight,project staff recruit children who are eligible to be counted and servedby the Migrant Education Program. They then enroll them as migratory childrenin the MSRTS, which provides the children with individualized identificationnumbers, and enter any available medical or educational information aboutthem for future retrieval by SEA or LEA personnel in other States. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In making this information so readily available to school districtpersonnel around the country, the projects operated at these stopover sitesperform an important function. Yet, given the way the MPAS now operates,enrollment of these children in the MSRTS also has the effect of generatingresidency credit for States operating these projects for up to one fullyear, if the States to which the children move subsequently fail to locateand recruit them as migratory children on the basis of the current moves.This circumstance alone draws into question the statutory basis for continuingto allow the States operating these projects to so benefit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The problem posed by recruitment at the stopover sites is exacerbatedbecause the project staff there typically learn from the migrant familiesthemselves not only that their children will be leaving those sites immediatelyfor other destinations, but the expected destinations themselves. Underthese circumstances, permitting States operating these projects to retaina windfall in the FTE number of migratory children estimated to residewithin their boundaries, solely because other States to which the childrenmove failed to recruit them, is not consistent with any reasonable processfor calculating the migrant child counts of States where these stopoversites exist. Therefore, in keeping with the Secretary's responsibilitiesunder section 1201(b) of the Act to allocate program funds on the basisof ``statistics made available by the [MSRTS] or such other system as theSecretary may determine most accurately and fully reflects the actual numberof migrant students'' full- and part-time, who are estimated to residein each State, the Secretary has included andSection; 201.20(a)(3) in theMigrant Education Program regulations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Until now, the Department has specifically permitted those Statesthat recruit migratory children at stopover sites to receive the same residencycredit on their account as any other migrant children. This is so despitethe fact that typically, when staff at the stopover sites recruit the children,they are informed that the children will be traveling, often the followingday, to other locations usually in other States to enable their parentsor guardians to obtain qualifying employment. The Secretary has determinedthat continuing to permit SEAs to accrue residency credit after these childrenhave left the stopover sites for locations in other States violates section1201(b) of the Act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. <T3>The differences between enrollment of migratory children at the stopoversites and enrollment elsewhere. </T3>Commenters correctly observed thatproposed andSection; 201.20(a)(3) is an exception to the general ``enrollmentto enrollment'' process that the Department has long sanctioned as partof the MPAS. Under that process, the MPAS attributes the residency of eachmigratory child to the State in which he or she was last identified. Thechild may move elsewhere, but unless another State identifies him or heras a migratory child residing within its boundaries, the first State willcontinue to accrue residency credit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Despite the fact that the statistics the MSRTS annually provides ofeach State's migrant child count, as derived from the MPAS, are only asgood as the extent and quality of the nation's multi-State recruitmentof currently migratory children, the Department has long justified thecontinued use of the MPAS on three bases. First, States cannot easily providereliable information to each other on the expected date and location ofmigrant children's arrival in the ``receiving'' State. Second, any efforton their part to do so would be administratively burdensome, intrusive,and extremely costly, because in many cases project staff would have toconduct follow-up visits with migrant families and, against the State'sfiscal interest, record yet more information on their children's travelplans. Finally, use of the MPAS creates financial incentives for Statesto locate currently migratory children residing within their boundaries,since each child found will generate program funding, and each child overlookedmay continue to benefit another State. However, these rationales for thecontinued use of the MPAS cannot justify retention, by the States operatingprojects at the stopover sites, of residency credits for children whomthey know will proceed immediately to other States. First, project staffscollect information on the children's destinations as families in transit;the information is inherently reliable because the parents or guardianswho provide it know their immediate travel plans. Second, project staffcollect this information (or can collect the information) on children'sdestinations during the recruitment interview. Therefore, no additionaladministrative burden, intrusion, or cost is incurred. Indeed, the functionof these stopover migrant education projects, in most cases, includes obtainingthis very information so that parents and the school districts into whichthe families expect to move can better find each other. Finally, whileother States retain financial incentives to locate children who are recruitedat these stopover projects and benefit directly from the information availableto them through the MSRTS entries, the fundamental inconsistency with section1201(b) of the Act remains. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is true that States with migrant education projects at these stopoversites, like all other States, may fail to recruit some of their migratorychildren, thereby allowing the MSRTS to under-count their migrant childcounts. But no logical relationship exists between the unknown extent ofthat failure and the known inflation in the number of migrant childrento which States with stopover sites are credited because of the way theMPAS generates residency data for migratory children who are enrolled atthem. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 201.20(a)(3) does not establish new eligibility requirements.SEAs in States that operate projects at these stopover sites can legitimatelyrecruit any migrant child whose family comes to the project site becauseof the amenities or services the site provides, and enroll him or her inthe MSRTS as a migratory child. However, they may not use the MSRTS andits MPAS to generate inflated numbers of their States' migrant residentswith which the Secretary determines levels of State Migrant Education Programfunding. Doing so directly conflicts with section 1201(b) of the Act, whichdirects the Secretary to allocate those funds according to the most accuratestatistics on the estimated FTE number of migrant children residing ineach State. Consequently, the fact that section 1201(b) includes languageidentical to that in the previous statute is of no account.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">D. <T3>The Secretary's plan to continue funding the stopover site projects.</T3>The Secretary acknowledges the substantial national benefits that SEA effortsat these stopover sites have provided to the thousands of migrant childrenand their families who have passed through them. The Secretary also acknowledgesthe value of these projects in providing advance notification to otherStates about the children who are moving to their areas. The Secretary'sobjective, in issuing andSection; 201.20(a)(3), is improving the accuracyof State child counts and the corresponding State-by-State distributionof Migrant Education Program funds, not eliminating worthwhile projectsthat serve important interstate needs of currently migratory children.Therefore, as one commenter recommended, the Secretary intends to commencediscussions with State officials about ways to secure continued financialsupport for these projects from funds appropriated to the Department undersection 1203 of the Act for grants or contracts that promote the interstateor intrastate coordination of Migrant Education Program services. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">E. <T3>The need for maximum recruitment to continue at the stopover sites.</T3>The Secretary recognizes that the combined effect of andSection; 201.20(a)(3)and the allocation formula in section 1201(b) of the Act may have the unfortunatepractical consequence of eliminating the recruitment and enrollment ofmigratory children who would be State residents for only a day or two.Since it depends, in part, on an aggregation of child residency days, theallocation formula provides little fiscal reward for SEAs to expend theeffort needed to recruit and enroll those children who will shortly moveelsewhere. SEAs that, until now, have enrolled these children may feelthey are receiving insufficient additional funds to justify the continuedeffort. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Nonetheless, the Secretary trusts that all SEAs affected by andSection;201.20(a)(3) will reject this parochial view, and continue expending theresources to permit active recruitment of <T3>all</T3> migrant children who pass through their States' stopover sites.Doing so will serve important educational objectives and benefit all ofthe States concerned. It will ensure that all migrant children who needthe services available at the sites can get them. It will ensure that accuraterecords of these children's moves are established. Finally, recruitmentof all those children who pass through the stopover sites, and enteringcorresponding residency data into the MSRTS identifying the period of theirbrief stays there, will substantially improve the accuracy of MSRTS statisticson the FTE numbers of migratory children residing in each State. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This one act, if performed at all sites, will permit the MSRTS statisticson the FTE number of migratory children residing in the ``sending'' Statesto reflect the fact that children who arrive at the stopover sites no longerreside in the States they have left. The Chapter 1_Migrant Education Program,as a national program, will thereby benefit because the Secretary willbe able more fairly and with greater confidence to distribute program fundsto all States, ``sending,'' ``receiving,'' and those where stopover sitesexist, on the basis of more accurate estimates of where migrant childrenactually reside. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">F. <T3>Consideration of proposals to overhaul the system for generating statisticson the migrant children residing in each State.</T3> The Secretary alsoconsidered the comment of those who believed that proposed andSection; 201.20(a)(3)did not go far enough. Suggestions that Chapter 1_Migrant Education Programfunds be allocated on the basis of the numbers of children actually servedby migrant education projects have some merit but require further studyby the Department. If implemented, they might permit MSRTS or another systemto generate very accurate child count information while decreasing theamount of Migrant Education Program funds diverted from educational programsinto child recruitment and enrollment efforts. The proposals, however,would not alleviate current problems of (1) identifying eligible childrenunder the definitions in andSection; 201.3, or (2) determining which childrenshould be favored for receipt of program services given the statutory priorityin section 1202(b) that favors currently migratory children. They alsowould likely decrease incentives SEAs now have to identify their currentlymigratory children, those who are hardest to find but who are the <T3>raison d'etre</T3> for the Migrant Education Program. In any event,the proposals conflict with the existing statutory requirement in section1201(b) of the Act that the Secretary allocate funds on the basis of themost accurate estimate of each State's FTE number of migrant children residingwithin its boundaries. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Conversely, because they are controversial, the Secretary will treatas suggestions for future rulemaking the separate proposals (1) that receivingStates that have not actually located and identified migratory childrenstill receive some residency credit on the basis of information parentsconvey to the staff of the stopover projects, and (2) that the Secretaryconsider discarding the MPAS altogether for what the commenter characterizedas unreasonable assumptions about continued child eligibility. The proposalswill be studied as part of the Secretary's overall review of improvementsthat may still be needed in the quality of MPAS' estimates of State migrantchild counts and, more generally, in the way Migrant Education Programfunds should be allocated nationwide. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> The substance of proposed andSection; 201.20(a)(3) hasbeen retained. However, the proposal has been modified as described inthe following discussions of comments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters recommended that, to avoid confusion,the terms ``project'' and ``en route'' in proposed andSection; 201.20(a)(3)be defined or narrowed. Some commenters were concerned that, as written,the proposed regulations might prohibit desirable recruitment in any projectthat is located in an area to which migrant families have traveled to enablethe child or members of the child's family to obtain temporary or seasonalwork in agriculture or fishing. Others feared that the proposal would placeundue recordkeeping and other administrative burdens on all States as theirrecruiters sought to determine whether migrant families were en route tolocations in other States. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> In proposing andSection; 201.20(a)(3), the Secretarywished to address one evident distortion that the current MPAS createsin the data that the MSRTS generates on each State's estimated annual migrantchild count. It is the distortion caused by ``large scale'' efforts, conductedat sites that provide education and other services designed to attractmigratory families during their moves from one location to another, torecruit migratory children who pass through them, coupled with the failureof States to which the families are moving to identify and enroll manyof these children. The proposed regulations intended to address only thissituation, not the more customary and varied forms of statewide recruitmentactivities. Consistent with that intent, the final regulations do not limitenrollment in the MSRTS of children recruited outside the kind of stopoversite described above and in discussion of the preceding comment. Specifically,as revised in response to public comment, andSection; 201.20(a)(3) has noeffect on whatever recruitment efforts and MSRTS enrollment proceduresmay exist at stopover projects that offer migrant families short-term services,or job placement in temporary or seasonal agriculture or fishing, and thatare located in the States to which migrant children and families have movedto enable them to seek or obtain qualifying work.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With regard to situations not addressed by andSection; 201.20(a)(3),the Secretary does not encourage SEA or LEA officials to recruit, as aState resident, any migratory child whom they discover is simply passingthrough the State so that a family member can seek or obtain employmentelsewhere, unless they are likewise prepared to notify MSRTS to stop givingthe State residency credit as of the date the recruiter learned the childexpects to leave the State. However, the conditions under which this kindof recruitment effort occurs are likely to be far more random and unpredictablethan those existing at the designated stopover sites that are the subjectof andSection; 201.20(a)(3). The quality of the estimates that MSRTS generateson the FTE number of each State's migratory children certainly warrantsserious study. Until the study by the Department is completed, the Secretaryis not prepared to regulate further in this area because of doubt thatthe resulting adjustments in State Migrant Education Program allocationsjustify the increased documentation and administrative burdens that regulationswould impose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>Section 201.20(a)(3) has been revised to clarify itsapplicability to situations in which stopover sites are designed to attractmigrant families who are in transit to locations in other areas to obtaintemporary or seasonal employment in agriculture or fishing. It also clarifiesthat the limitations imposed on the period for which States, having recruitedmigratory children at those sites, may enroll children in the MSRTS orother system do not apply in the case of a child in transit to anotherlocation within the same State. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>Proposed andSection; 201.20(a)(3) appeared to applyonly to migrant education stopover projects the SEA ``operates.''

Currently, the Department provides all SEAs the same FTE creditfor the total days of student enrollment in State summer school programsoperated any time between May 15 and August 31, regardless of the levelsof intensity and cost of those programs. The Secretary's proposal wouldhave given that full FTE credit only for days students are enrolled duringthis period in intensive programs of instruction, defined to be a minimumoperation of three hours per day or fifteen hours per week. Days of enrollmentfor students enrolled in less intensive programs would have generated halfthe FTE credit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Those favoring the proposal cited its improvement over the currentformula that does not address in any manner the differences in programcost or intensity of summer school programs operated throughout the country.However, many commenters felt that while its thrust was correct, the proposalwas far too weak. Several commenters expressed concern that the term ``programof instruction'' needed definition. One commenter observed that otherwisethe Department would continue its practice of rewarding FTE summer enrollmentdata that included alleged participation in projects that were ``littlemore than dates entered in the MSRTS computer,'' such as a one-way correspondenceproject that mailed workbooks to migrant students of which the commenterwas aware. Many commenters, particularly those from ``receiving'' Stateswhose State programs emphasized summer programs, argued that the singlesupplemental FTE credit for every 109 days of enrollment between May 15and August 31 generated too little additional funding to meet the costsof operating intensive summer projects. Many of these commenters recommendedthat the larger FTE credit for enrollment in intensive summer school programsof instruction be awarded for a much smaller number of days of enrollment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On the other hand, the Secretary received many comments from thoseopposing proposed andSection; 201.20(b). Commenters argued that the proposalwould discourage innovative instruction and drastically reduce the numberof migratory children whom summer programs would be able to reach. Commentersfrom one large State stressed the emphasis the SEA had placed on praise-winning,effective, and non-traditional summer programs that serve large numbersof migratory children. These commenters claimed the proposal would costa significant proportion of their State's annual allocation of MigrantEducation Program funds and summer program budget, with devastating repercussionson its migrant children. In addition, noting that andSection; 201.20(b) wouldnot provide any summer allocation adjustment to programs of instructionthat were ``not part of the regular school program,'' some commenters expressedconcern about the inequity of decreasing SEA allocations to those Stateswhose school districts operate on a ``year-round'' basis. Still other commentersurged the Secretary to decrease, rather than increase, the significanceof the summer school adjustment in the overall formula for allocating MigrantEducation Program funds, so as not to detract regular school programs formigratory children, which the commenters believed were more important.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In keeping with the service priorities in section 1202(b) of the Actthat favor programs and services for currently migratory children, manycommenters stressed the failure of both the current formula and proposedandSection; 201.20(b) to focus on the need for increasing the levels andproportion of funding for programs designed to meet the needs of thosechildren. Many also recommended that, in view of the subject's complexity,the proposed change in the summer formula be withdrawn so that varioussuggestions for revising the Department's current formula can be studiedin detail. One commenter stressed that the Department's current formulawas outdated, and that it derived from a collective decision made overten years ago that relied upon the existing data and conjecture, but whichat the time was deemed ``equitable for the first year only.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Lastly, commenters disagreed on the goals that any summer school adjustmentformula seeking to implement section 1201(b) of the Act should address.Some stressed the need for a formula tied to defraying more of the coststhat intensive summer school programs of instruction incur. Others stressedthat receiving States need more money to provide basic services for theirsummer migrant children, both to defray the costs of their existing programsand to allow creation of many more that are needed in unserved portionsof their States. Still others stressed that all Migrant Education Programfunding, whether related to the special summer school adjustment or not,should be tied to the costs of programs that attempt to meet the needsof currently migratory children. Finally, many commenters insisted thatthe SEA should determine the best form of summer school programs to meetneeds of the State's migratory children, without pressure from a summeradjustment formula that rewarded only particular forms of intensive instruction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>Section 1201(b) of the Act directs the Secretary toadjust the FTE number of migratory children in States during summer months``to take into account the special needs of those children for summer programsand the additional costs of operating such programs during the summer.''As the Supplemental Information accompanying the January 26, 1989 NPRMexplained (54 FR 3926), the Department's method for implementing this adjustmentgives equal weight to the daily enrollment of every child enrolled in anymigrant education summer school program. An SEA provides the MSRTS withthe identities of enrolled students and the enrollment and withdrawal datesof what it considers to be qualifying programs. The MSRTS aggregates thedata to provide an adjusted summer FTE count for the State that, when addedto its regular calendar year FTE count, produces the MSRTS statistics onthe numbers of migratory children enrolled in the State. This total numberforms the basis of the Department's annual allocations of Migrant EducationProgram funds. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As noted in the Supplemental Information to the NPRM, the Secretaryis concerned that the Department's current summer school adjustment formulamay unfairly reward SEAs whose summer projects passively serve large numbersof migrant children at the expense of SEAs whose projects intensively servefar fewer. Many commenters not only expressed a similar concern, but criticizedproposed andSection; 201.20(b) because it still did not generate adequatefunding for the intensive summer programs that their States operate forcurrently migratory children. Conversely, the Secretary is aware of somesummer school projects that, through the existing formula, generate MigrantEducation Program funding for their States far in excess of their summerschool costs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As proposed, andSection; 201.20(b) sought to ameliorate some of theseapparent inequities and to do so, through reliance upon MSRTS data likethose currently used, with minimal administrative cost and burden. Thoseinequities affect the fairness with which the Department allocates programfunds linked to summer school costs and needs. Since the FTE summer schooladjustment is but one element of the broader Migrant Education Programallocation formula that relies upon the total FTE number of each State'smigrant children, persistent inequities in the summer adjustment formulaalso raise disturbing questions about the relative purpose of careful Stateidentification and recruitment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In proposing andSection; 201.20(b), the Secretary wanted to begin theprocess of addressing these inequities. The Secretary is concerned aboutthe potential impact that this and other formula changes might have onany State's existing innovative programs. However, the Secretary is alsoconcerned that a funding allocation system be implemented that, consistentwith section 1201(b) of the Act, responds to the costs of operating summerschool programs and the numbers of migrant children, particularly currentlymigratory children, enrolled in them throughout the nation. In this regard,the Secretary observes that enactment of the special summer adjustmentin 1978 in section 141 of Pub. L. 95-561 was specifically described bythe House Education and Labor Committee as necessary to meet the unmetneeds of <T3>currently </T3>migratory children: ``[T]he lack of stability in theaverage migrant child's educational process, speaks for the necessity ofsummer programs, but few States have implemented these programs due totheir higher costs.'' See H.R. Rep. No. 95-1137, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 40(1978). The Secretary acknowledges that the proposed andSection; 201.20(b)did not adequately address adjustments needed in FTEs to reflect the costsof summer school programs established for currently migratory children.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Reaction to the proposal has revealed the depth and extent of publicconcern about any new regulations the Secretary might now issue. Commentersof all viewpoints urged caution and further study to avoid what they believedmight be widespread and unpredictable ramifications that andSection; 201.20(b)would cause. In response, the Secretary agrees that further study and debateabout the specifications of a new summer school adjustment formula mustoccur before a new proposal can be issued. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the Secretary has determined that the Department's existingsummer adjustment formula should be retained without modification to permita review of other formulas for adjusting State FTE numbers of migratorychildren that might better reflect the costs of summer school programsfor currently migratory children. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>Section 201.20(b) has been revised by deleting the two-tierformula. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 201.25 Amount of a Subgrant </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters objected to proposed andSection; 201.25(a)(1),which included as a factor in the amount of a subgrant to an LEA the countof only currently migratory children, rather than currently and formerlymigratory children, residing in an area to be served by the project. Commentersemphasized that the statute required only that a local project give priorityto the needs of currently migratory children. They argued, therefore, thatsince Public Law 200-297 was silent on how the amount of subgrants shouldbe determined, Congress left to the States the authority to calculate theamounts of subgrants, if they chose, based on the total number of migratorychildren residing in areas served by those agencies. A few commenters stressedtheir view that SEAs needed this authority so that they could operate effectiveprograms tailored to meeting their States' unique needs, such as in areaswith relatively low levels of currently migratory children. One commenterstated that otherwise, the SEA's grant will permit ``many arbitrary decisions.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other commenters offered opinions about proposed andSection; 201.25(a)(4),which would require that the criteria the SEA uses to determine the amountof a subgrant include the availability of funds from other sources. Onecommenter recommended that this criterion be revised to reflect ``fundsor services,'' and that if the criteria listed in andSection; 201.25(a)(4)were intended to reflect a descending order of priority, that this criterionbe given greater importance. Another commenter suggested that the Secretaryclarify to what extent the SEA had to exhaust efforts to obtain these fundsor services from other sources before including corresponding amounts ofMigrant Education Program funds in the subgrant. Still another commenterappeared to recommend deletion of the criterion altogether as inconsistentwith the manner in which the Department allocates Migrant Education Programfunds to the SEAs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1202(b) of the Act requires currently migratorychildren to be given ``priority in the consideration of programs and activities''contained in SEA applications for migrant program funding. While section1201(a) permits the SEA, if it chooses, to operate these programs and activitiesthrough subgrants to local operating agencies, the needs of the State'scurrently migratory children must be given precedence in the developmentof the State's projects. As noted in response to the preceding comment,Congress further stressed the priority it was placing on currently migratorychildren when it enacted the special summer school adjustment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. <T3>The practice of subgranting on the basis of numbers of total migratorychildren residing in the area served by the LEA.</T3> As proposed, andSection;201.25 appeared to some to impose a requirement that the amount of an SEA'ssubgrant to local operating agencies be based on a strict formula tiedto numbers and needs of currently migratory children residing in areasserved by those agencies. Its intent however was much simpler, to emphasizethat the way the SEA distributes Migrant Education Program funds must ensurethat the needs of the State's currently migratory children are being consideredand will be met. The Secretary does not believe an SEA can ensure thatthe needs of all significant concentrations of the State's currently migrantchildren are being met if, as is often the case, it calculates the amountof subgrants to LEAs simply by applying a formula tied to the numbers ofall migrant children found to be residing in areas the LEA would serve.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This kind of formula is simple to administer. However, funding projectareas with equal numbers of migrant children at the same levels, regardlessof either the relative proportion of those in each who are currently migratoryor the relative costs of programs designed to serve them, conflicts withthe SEA's responsibility to give ``priority in the consideration of programsand activities'' to currently migratory children. Moreover, the MigrantEducation Program is not really SEA-operated, as so many commenters insistedit remain, if the FTE number of migratory children residing in the areaserved by the LEA in a sense creates for that LEA a <T3>de facto</T3> entitlement to a formula-driven amount of migrant educationfunding on their account. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Moreover, previous departmental regulations have likewise not sanctioneduse of an automatic ``dollars per child'' subgrant formula. Rather, regulationsfor the Chapter 1_Migrant Education Program operated under the EducationConsolidation and Improvement Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 97-35), and predecessorregulations for the Title I Migrant Education Program under the Elementaryand Secondary Education Act as amended by the Education Amendments of 1978(Pub. L. 95-561) both have included the ``nature and scope'' of the LEA'sproposed project as factors the SEA was to consider in determining theamount of a subgrant, while the previous Chapter 1 regulations furtherrequired the SEA to consider the ``cost'' of that program. See andSection;201.25(b) of the Chapter 1 regulations issued on April 30, 1985, and andSection;204.40 of the Title I regulations issued on April 3, 1980. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Congress included no provision in Pub. L. 100-297 regarding the methodfor calculating subgrants. However, section 1431 of the Act specificallyauthorizes the Secretary to issue appropriate regulations to ensure compliancewith statutory requirements governing the Migrant Education Program. TheSecretary has determined that retention of the regulatory requirement thatan SEA consider the ``nature, scope, and cost'' of the LEA's proposed projectin determining the amount of a subgrant continues to be necessary for tworeasons. First, it will enable the Secretary, under section 1202 (a)(1)and (b), to determine that payments are used for programs and projectsdesigned to meet the needs of migratory children, particularly currentlymigratory children, residing in the area served by the LEA. Second, byensuring that the amount of a subgrant to an LEA bears a reasonable relationshipto the activities the LEA will conduct, it complements the SEA's responsibilitiesunder sections 1012(a) and 1202(a)(3) of the Act to exercise appropriatefiscal control over the use of Migrant Education Program funds. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Use of the kind of considered approach to determinations on the amountof a subgrant will not lead to ``arbitrary decisions,'' as one commentersuggested, because the SEA will be relying on project information and proposedbudgets offered by the LEA, under andSection; 201.17(b)(1)(ii), as part ofits subgrant application. Moreover, determining subgrant amounts by thenumbers of migratory children residing in particular areas of the Stateis perhaps the most arbitrary method of funds distribution since it awardsfunds to LEAs without regard to the relative needs of the State's migratory,particularly currently migratory, children. For all of these reasons, theSecretary has concluded that Migrant Education Program regulations mustcontinue to require an SEA to consider other relevant factors, in additionto the numbers of children who would benefit from the LEA's project, whenit determines the amount of a subgrant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. <T3>Funds and services available from other sources.</T3> Furthermore,the Secretary agrees with commenters that in order to use Migrant EducationProgram funds efficiently, a subgrant should not include amounts for projectactivities if funds ``or services'' from other sources are available toprovide them. While not part of the statutory formula under which the Departmentallocates Migrant Education Program funds to the States, the provisionis a necessary factor to be considered in determining the amount of a subgrantin order that limited program funding is most effectively utilized. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The SEA and its subgrantees must use reasonable efforts to securethese funds and services from the other sources, keeping in mind the needboth for avoiding unnecessary expenditures of program funds and to avoiddiscontinuity in providing needed educational and support services to migrantchildren.

Therefore, in response to comment, the Secretary hasmodified andSection; 201.25 accordingly. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Section 201.25(a) requires that before it awards anysubgrants to LEAs or other operating agencies, the SEA consider the relativeneeds of all operating agencies in the State for Migrant Education Programfunds to conduct projects designed to meet the needs of significant concentrationsof currently migratory children. Section 201.25(b) requires that beforeit awards subgrants to pay the supplemental costs of operating projectsthat stem from the inclusion of formerly migratory children, the SEA mustensure that the amount of each subgrant will be sufficient to meet theunmet needs of the operating agency's currently migratory children. Section201.25(c) provides that as long as it does so, the SEA shall determinethe amount of a subgrant using whatever procedures it believes are appropriate,based on the broad criteria in andSection; 201.25 of the former Chapter 1_MigrantEducation Program regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 201.25(c)(1) expressly permits an SEA to use the number ofmigratory children residing in the area served by the project as a componentof its subgrant formula.

The Secretary has concluded that because the SEA must operatea statewide program, it should not be responsible for expending resourcesin those areas of the State where the numbers of currently migratory childrenwith special educational needs are so few that Migrant Education Programfunds cannot be prudently spent. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>Section 201.25 (b) and (c) has been changed in responseto other comments, but retains the requirement regarding ``sufficient concentrations''of currently migratory children with special educational needs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 201.30 Eligibility of a Child to Participate </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters recommended that the language inproposed andSection; 201.30(c) regarding the certificate of eligibility (COE)provide that the SEA's use of the national standard COE to be developedby the Secretary is permissive rather than mandatory.

The COEdeveloped by the Secretary will identify the essential information thatis needed to establish a child's eligibility. The SEA may adopt, modify,or reject use of that COE in its State. However, the SEA should ensurethat all agencies of the State that recruit migratory children use whateversingle COE the SEA approves. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>Section 201.30(c) has been modified accordingly. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>The Department received many comments recommending thatthe Secretary interpret the five percent error rate in section 1201(b)(1)of the Act in a manner that does not burden SEA officials. While one commentermerely expressed a general desire that requirements for State documentationnot be burdensome and counterproductive, commenters generally urged theSecretary to interpret the provision as establishing a margin of errorin the case of audit, rather than an affirmative SEA responsibility tomonitor the eligibility information it submitted to the MSRTS. Many commentersstressed their view that, in enacting the provision in section 1201(b),Congress did not intend to impose an administrative burden of this kindon SEAs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>As discussed in response to comments on proposed andSection;201.20(a)(2), the Secretary agrees with the comments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>For clarity, the regulatory provision concerning thefive percent error rate, proposed in andSection; 201.30(c), has been incorporatedinto new andSection; 201.30(d) and andSection; 201.30(e). Section 201.30(d)provides that the five percent error rate is operational only in the caseof an audit. Section 201.30(e) provides further that while the SEA is responsiblefor ensuring that children who are ineligible for the Migrant EducationProgram are not determined to be migratory, the SEA is not responsiblefor auditing its determinations for correctness within a five percent marginof error. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Several commenters inquired how the Secretary interpretedthe statutory provision that, in submitting their eligibility information,the States ``not exceed a standard error rate of 5 percent.'' Commenterswished to know whether the five percent referred to the total number ofchildren enrolled as eligible in the MSRTS, to the total number of StateCOEs (where siblings were enrolled on the same forms), to the FTE numberof migratory children whom MSRTS statistics estimate to be residents ofthe State, or to the individual pieces of information recorded on the SEA'sCOE. Commenters consistently recommended the first approach. One commenteralso expressed confusion about the meaning of the phrase ``standard rateof error,'' and recommended it be replaced by a phrase like ``maximum errorrate.'' Another commenter recommended that the language in proposed andSection;201.30(c) about the five percent rate of error be deleted as unnecessaryin light of similar language contained in proposed andSection; 201.20(a)(2).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion. </T3>Because questions raised by the five percent standarderror rate pertain most directly to matters of ensuring the correctnessof State eligibility information, the Secretary believes it should be addressedin andSection; 201.30 rather than in andSection; 201.20, which concerns theamount of an SEA's grant. The Secretary agrees with the commenters thatthe five percent error rate applies to the actual numbers of children whomthe SEA annually enrolls in the MSRTS as eligible to participate in theMigrant Education Program. While it might also apply to the State's MSRTS-generatedFTE number of migrant children, the Secretary does not believe Congressintended one State's error rate to depend upon the quality of another State'srecruitment effort and enrollment information, as would occur under theMPAS the MSRTS uses to generate its statistics. See the discussion of commentson proposed andSection; 201.20(a)(3). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Moreover, the Secretary believes that in view of the complexitiesassociated with applying the eligibility definitions in andSection; 201.3,Congress enacted the margin of error provision to ensure that SEAs weregiven a reasonable latitude in the correctness of their child eligibilitydeterminations. Because, under the MPAS, after enrolling a child in theMSRTS an SEA loses control over the period of time within the succeeding365-day period that the child will generate as a State resident, it islogical that the five percent error rate apply to the very decisions oneligibility of individual children over which the SEA can exercise responsibility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finding no indication of a contrary congressional intent, the Secretaryinterprets the phrase ``standard error rate'' to mean ``margin of error,''as the commenter had recommended. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>Section 201.30(d) provides that in case of audit, theSecretary considers both the SEA determinations and the statistics generatedby the MSRTS or other system on the FTE number of migratory children residingwithin the State to be correct, if the number of children whom the SEAor its operating agencies found to be eligible migratory children is correctwithin a five percent margin of error. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that the five percent errorrate apply when incorrect eligibility information results in ``non-eligiblestudents being served.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>Under andSection; 201.30(a), the SEA or its operatingagency must indicate in writing the basis for determining a child to bea migratory child as the term is defined in andSection; 201.2 before he orshe may be counted as a migratory child or provided with program services.Section 1201(b)(1) of the Act provides that the five percent rate of errorapplies to information needed to make determinations on the total FTE numberof migratory children estimated to reside in each State, and this statementis reflected in andSection; 201.30(d). Since the State's eligibility determinationsare also used to determine which children will be served with Migrant EducationProgram services, an SEA charged with serving ineligible children on astatewide basis may, under appropriate circumstances, demonstrate thatthe total number of ineligible children served by the program does notexceed five percent. However, the Secretary does not believe that thismatter needs to be the subject of regulations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>None.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The enactment of the new requirements in section 1201of the Act that the Secretary develop a national standard COE and thatStates be given a five percent margin of error in their eligibility determinations,has created some confusion about their relationship to the SEA's responsibilityunder proposed andSection; 201.30(c) for ``implementing procedures that ensurethe correctness of the information on which the SEA or the operating agencyrelies.'' The Secretary has concluded that development of that COE, andits possible use by each SEA, is intended to give State and local officialsconfidence in the adequacy of the COE the SEA adopts for its State, andto eliminate future expenditures of resources devoted to modifying theState's COE. However, while use of the national standard COE, or any adequateCOE, ensures the use of an acceptable document for purposes of recordkeeping,it does not ensure the necessary ``correctness of the information on whichthe SEA or the operating agency relies.'' Use of the COE is a necessarybut not sufficient condition for proper recordkeeping. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is the accuracy of the information recorded on the COE, ratherthan the completed COE itself, that determines the eligibility of a migrantchild. Therefore, the five percent error rate does not relate to the numberof COEs that on their face contain information supporting the children'seligibility, but rather to the quality of the information recorded on theseCOEs. It is the quality of that information that must be the subject ofthe SEA's procedures under andSection; 201.30(b) ``that ensure the correctnessof the information on which the SEA or the operating agencies rely'' (subjectto the five percent margin of error that will apply if an audit occurs).This subject has been the topic of substantial public discussion and commentin response to the May 1988 and January 1989 proposals offered by the Department'sOffice of Migrant Education to revise nonregulatory guidance, and the Secretaryis satisfied that the public understands and concurs with this approach.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Section 201.30 has been rewritten to clarify the SEA'sresponsibilities for implementing procedures that ensure the correctnessof eligibility information extend both to use of an adequate COE and tothe implementation of a process to ensure that the completed COE containsinformation that is both accurate and in sufficient detail to explain thefactors making the child eligible for the Migrant Education Program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter urged deletion of language in the secondsentence of proposed andSection; 201.30(c) that suggested that the SEA, ratherthan the Secretary, determine the FTE number of migratory children residingin each State. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary agrees that the proposed language incorrectlyimplied that each State determine its count of migratory children.

They stated that, in keeping with section 1202(b) ofthe Act, which establishes the priority for currently migratory childrenin all programs and activities ``contained in applications submitted underthis section,'' the service priority should be limited to those programsand activities conducted under the Migrant Education Program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary agrees with the comment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Section 201.31(a) has been revised to require an SEAor operating agency to give currently migratory children priority in allprograms and activities that are offered ``pursuant to its approved applicationsfor Migrant Education Program funds.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> Section 201.31(a), as proposed, would have required currentlymigratory children to be given priority over formerly migratory childrenin receipt of all Migrant Education Program services. One commenter statedthat strict implementation of the proposal could create student selectionprocedures that are not necessarily educationally sound. In particular,the commenter observed that a single-year period as a currently migratorychild provided insufficient time to address the cumulative effects of educationaldisruption, while the priority favoring them over formerly migratory childrenprevented formerly migratory children still suffering the effects of educationaldisruption from receiving sufficient levels of services. Another commenter,through a response to the proposed requirement, in andSection; 201.36(a),that students selected for project participation ``have the greatest needfor special assistance (as identified on the basis of educationally relatedobjective criteria),'' stressed that at times formerly migratory childrenare in greater need of services than currently migratory children. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The comments raise the significant question of whether andSection; 201.31(a)must retain its absolute rigidity in favor of services to currently migratorychildren. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The issue is fundamental to the Migrant EducationProgram. Because the program exists to assist migratory children, currentlymigratory children must remain its central focus. However, isolated situationsmay exist in which, perhaps because of their previous dislocations andschool interruptions, some formerly migratory children have needs thatare greater than those of the currently migratory children residing inthe project area. Conceivably, this might be so because of the lack ofa minimum requirement for a migratory ``move'' (see the discussion of commentson andSection; 201.3), or because climatic or industrial changes in a particularyear cause significant numbers of an area's neediest migratory childrento refrain from moving. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As proposed, andSection; 201.31(a) repeated the requirement in previousregulations that currently migratory children be given ``priority overformerly migratory children in receipt of services provided.'' The proposalis somewhat broader than the underlying statutory requirement in section1202(b) of the Act, which requires currently migratory children to receive``priority in the consideration of programs and activities'' describedin program applications. The Secretary does not interpret the statutoryprovision to require blind allegiance to a priority favoring currentlymigratory children if, for example, needs assessments plainly reveal agreater need among formerly migratory children residing in an area. Onthe other hand, any broad revision of proposed andSection; 201.31(a) couldhave very adverse consequences for currently migratory children.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary has determined that this dilemma can best be resolvedby modifying andSection; 201.31(a) to reflect the more flexible statutorylanguage in section 1202(b) of the Act, and then using the annual needsassessment procedures discussed in andSection; 201.32 as the vehicle forselecting children to participate in migrant education programs and projects.In particular, andSection; 201.32(a)(5) requires SEAs and operating agenciesto design their programs around the needs of those migratory children,consistent with the service priorities in andSection; 202.32, who would benefitmost from them. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary intends these provisions to permit SEA and local projectofficials to respond to those situations in which the special educationalneeds of formerly migratory children clearly exceed those of currentlymigratory children. They may do so by using the needs assessment processto identify services that are available to those currently migratory childrenfrom other sources, thereby directing limited Migrant Education Programfunds to benefit those ``most in need.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>Section 201.31(a) has been modified to require that currentlymigratory children be given priority over formerly migratory children ``inthe consideration of all [migrant education] programs and projects'' theSEA, LEA, or other operating agency offers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 201.32 Annual Needs Assessment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>Various commenters stated that the needs assessment requirement,as proposed in andSection; 201.32, conformed too closely to the comparablerequirement for the Chapter 1 Program in LEAs in section 1014(b) of theAct. They observed that the proposal failed to take into considerationthe special problems posed by the mobility of migratory children. Commentersrecommended that the provision be revised in keeping with the requirementin section 1202(a)(3) of the Act that programs and projects conducted underthe Migrant Education Program ``be administered and carried out in a mannerconsistent with the basic objectives of'' section 1014(b). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that andSection; 201.32 shouldbe revised to adapt the needs assessment requirement in section 1014 ofthe Act to the special nature of the Migrant Education Program and migratorychildren who, because of the nature and extent of their migration, mayhave special needs that are different from those of non-migratory children.In doing so, the Secretary has modified language of the comparable provisionin andSection; 200.31 of the Department's May 19, 1989 regulations governingthe Chapter 1 Program in LEAs to highlight differences in the ways thetwo programs must operate. Therefore, andSection; 201.32 follows the formof andSection; 200.31 more closely than did the proposed regulations, butdeviates from the latter provision in several important respects. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">First, unlike the case in the Chapter 1 Program in LEAs, SEA and operatingagency staff conducting migrant education programs and projects may beunable to design them around children whom they expect to participate thefollowing year. Operating agencies that conduct regular school year projectseither for children who move at other times of the year or for formerlymigratory children may be able to do so. Agencies that conduct other projects,including summer school projects, may not. Therefore, andSection; 201.32(a)has been revised to permit the needs assessment to be based upon an identificationof the children or, if that is not possible, the characteristics of thechildren expected to reside in the area the project will serve. Section201.32(b) now requires the SEA and operating agency to consider the differingneeds, if any, that currently and formerly migratory children have in viewof differing effects of migration on educational continuity and development.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 201.32(c), like the NPRM, requires that all projects, regardlessof the types of migratory children they serve, must assess needs on thebasis of educationally related objective criteria. However, the Secretaryrecognizes that projects serving children who miss substantial periodsof the regular school term, or who attend summer school programs in areasother than those in which they regularly attend school, face proceduraldifficulties that do not arise elsewhere. Therefore, andSection; 201.32(c)now differentiates, in the kinds of educationally related objective criteriato be used, among various migrant education projects. Some projects servestudents during the regular school year who are mostly 1) currently migratorychildren who remain in the same school district for all or most of theregular school year or 2) formerly migratory children. Agencies that operatethese projects can reasonably conduct needs assessments using educationalcriteria that are substantially similar to the criteria used in the Chapter1 Program in LEAs. While andSection; 201.32(c) encompasses the educationalcriteria that all projects serving currently migratory children must use,the Secretary interprets the provision as requiring these agencies to usethe same forms of ``educationally related objective criteria'' that include``the results of written or oral tests'' as do the Chapter 1 LEA projects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, andSection; 201.32(c) also clarifies that migrant educationprojects serving more actively transitory children are not required touse the results of formal testing to assess educational needs. This provisionis designed to recognize the practical difficulties that these disjointedor short-term projects may have in finding and using appropriate testingmethods. Therefore, while formal testing should be performed if it is reasonablypossible to do so, andSection; 201.32(c)(1) provides that projects servingcurrently migratory children may assess educational needs using the mostappropriate form of educationally related objective criteria. These ``non-testing''objective criteria might include student absenteeism, reports from schooldistricts that migratory students previously attended, and objectivelyperformed teacher assessments. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, the Secretary has determined that the contents of paragraphs(c)(1), (c)(3), (d)(1), and (d)(2) of section 1014 of the Act do not pertainto the Migrant Education Program, and so have no place in these regulations.Paragraph (c)(1), providing LEA discretion to maintain Chapter 1 servicesto children who are transferred to another school attendance area, conflictswith the SEA's responsibility both to operate the State's migrant educationprogram and to determine the terms and amount of LEA subgrants. Paragraphs(c)(3) and (d)(2), regarding continuation of services to children fromyear to year, conflict with the service priority, in section 1202(b) ofthe Act, favoring services to currently migratory children. The specialrules in section 1014(d)(1), conditioning services to children with handicappingconditions or limited English proficiency on meeting needs ``stemming fromeducational deprivation,'' conflict with sections 1201 and 1202 of theAct, which impose no requirement that children receiving services underthe Migrant Education Program must be suffering from educational deprivation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>Section 201.32 has been revised accordingly. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters stressed that testing of migratorychildren, as part of a needs assessment, will likely be very cumbersomebecause their mobility and unpredictable dates of enrollment would requireyear-round testing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees that projects that typicallycannot predict the dates of students' enrollment may have special problemsusing standardized tests or other forms of educationally related objectivecriteria in conducting needs assessments on the basis of all children whoare expected to participate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Section 201.32(b)(2) clarifies that, with regard to projectsserving currently migratory children, the needs assessment may be conductedon the basis of the latest available information for those children ``expectedto be present at periods of peak enrollment.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters recommended that andSection; 201.32(c) and (d) be revised to clarify the relationship of the needs assessmentof one group of currently migratory children to the services that may wellbe provided to others, if those whose needs are assessed become ``formerlymigratory children'' in the following project year. One commenter recommendedthat the statement of criteria to be used to assess needs be revised toreflect the general educational needs of programs serving mobile children,rather than the individual needs of students who would receive services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The situations the commenters described are most typicallyfaced by projects that serve those currently migratory children who attendsummer projects away from their regular places of residence, or whose movessignificantly disrupt project attendance. Migrant education projects thatserve either other currently migratory children, i.e., those whose movesdo not affect regular school program enrollment, or formerly migratorychildren do not face these problems. These projects generally will servemany of the same students from year to year, and so can focus the needsassessment process on the needs of the same students who will participatethe following project year. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, projects designed to serve the other group of currently migratorychildren do require special consideration. The Secretary has provided flexibilityin the way LEAs conduct their needs assessments. First, andSection; 201.32(a)(1)permits the SEA or operating agency to identify either the migrant childrenor, if this is not possible, the ``specific characteristics of the childrenwho are expected to reside in'' the area served by the project. Second,as noted in the response to the previous comment, andSection; 201.32(b)(2)permits the needs of children to be assessed using information relevantto those children ``expected to be present at periods of peak enrollment.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The needs assessment requirement does not require use of testing,or any other educationally related objective criteria, to be used for childplacement. While it is logical to do so, andSection; 201.32 concerns projectdesign, not project placement. In this regard, andSection; 201.32(a) requiresthat the needs assessment procedures, and the educationally related criteriaused to assess needs, be used to ``improve migrant education programs andprojects.'' The fact that the migratory children to be assessed may notbe the same as those expected to participate in the following year's projectcreates no significant problems provided the SEA or operating agency hasreason to believe the needs of participating migratory children will besimilar from project year to project year. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> As discussed in response to this comment, andSection; 201.32(c)now includes a requirement that those migrant education projects servingstudents whose migration affects project participation only need to usethe ``most appropriate'' educationally related criteria when assessingstudent needs ``including, if reasonably possible, the results of writtenor oral tests.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter objected to requiring the use of educationallyrelated objective criteria because many local project staff lack the skillsto administer tests properly. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> Subject to the flexibility that has been incorporatedinto andSection; 201.32 in response to the preceding comments, the Secretaryhas determined that the use of educationally related objective criteriain assessing educational needs, like other program requirements, may notbe waived merely because of the relative capabilities of project staff.In operating migrant education projects throughout its State, the SEA isresponsible for ensuring that those implementing projects are adequatelytrained in skills necessary to administer the projects. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned how the requirement in proposedandSection; 201.32(c) that projects assess needs on the basis of educationallyrelated objective criteria could be implemented for preschool projectsserving three- and four-year-old children. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary believes that all migrant educationprojects, even those designed to serve the special educational needs ofpreschool children, can benefit from adoption of a needs assessment process.However, the Secretary has determined that formal use of educationallyrelated criteria, objective or otherwise, to assess the special educationalneeds of preschool children could be unduly burdensome and costly. Therefore,andSection; 201.32 has been modified to require that the formal needs assessmentwith regard to projects operated for preschool children only identify childrenexpected to benefit most from preschool services and select those children,subject to the service priorities in andSection; 201.31. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> A new paragraph (e), limiting the scope of the needsassessment requirement to projects operating for preschool programs, hasbeen added to andSection; 201.32. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommended that the phrase ``educationallydeprived children'' in proposed andSection; 201.32(c) be changed to read``migratory children.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary agrees that sections 1201 and 1202 ofthe Act requires that migrant education programs and projects be designedto meet the special educational needs of ``migratory children.''

Thecommenter recommended the term be deleted. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> In enacting section 1014(b) of the Act, Congress specificallydirected library resource needs to be addressed. In many areas, migranteducation projects represent a significant, if not exclusive, portion ofthe total Chapter 1 services available to migrant students. Therefore,the Secretary has determined that the library resource needs of migratorystudents must be assessed. In doing so, the SEA or operating agency neednot overemphasize this particular need, but only must consider those needsalong with other needs of migratory children. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Section 201.32(a)(6) provides that as part of its needsassessment the SEA or operating agency determines the ``resources, suchas personnel, instructional materials, and library resources, necessaryto meet'' the identified special educational needs of children expectedto participate in the project. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 201.35 Requirements for Parent Involvement </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters requested that the new requirementsfor parental involvement be included in the regulations rather than incorporatedby reference into andSection; 201.35(c) through the phrase ``in a mannerconsistent with paragraphs (a) through (c) and (e) of 34 CFR 200.34.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary has determined that restating the manynew requirements governing parental involvement in andSection; 201.35 isunnecessary. Section 200.34 of the regulations governing the Chapter 1Program in LEAs, which itself restates the underlying provisions in section1016 of the Act, provides a full recitation of those provisions. Sincenearly all State and local agencies that operate migrant education projectsalso operate Chapter l LEA projects, the Chapter l LEA program regulationsare readily available to Migrant Education Program staff. Therefore, becauseof their length, these provisions will not be republished in these regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Upon review of andSection; 200.34, the Secretary has determined thatparagraph (d) governing the LEA's annual assessment of its parental involvementprogram does not apply to parental activities conducted under the MigrantEducation Program. That provision stems from program improvement plan requirementsin section 1021 of the Act, which do not apply to migrant education programsand projects. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Section 201.35(c) clarifies that the requirements inandSection; 200.34(d) do not apply. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The statutory provision in section 1202(a)(4) of theAct that <T3>all</T3> migrant education projects be carried out ``consistent withthe requirements of section 1016'' expands the existing parental participationrequirements for projects operated at the LEA level for the duration ofthe school year. For those projects, as with the State program as a whole,section 1202(a)(4) also requires LEA officials to ensure that project planningand operation includes appropriate consultation with parent advisory councils(PACs). Some confusion may exist about how these dual requirements impactupon each other.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary encourages LEAs to conduct their new section 1016 responsibilitiesthrough active PACs if it is appropriate to do so. If a PAC is active,the LEA can use it as the focal point of its effort, for example, to ensurefull parental involvement in program planning, design, and implementation(section 1016(c)(1)), to convene an annual meeting of parents, where schoolofficials explain the migrant education projects to be conducted (section1016(c)(2)), and to provide opportunities for regular meetings of parentsto provide formal input into the program (section 1016(c)(4)). However,even if PACs are strong and enjoy good working relations with school officials,section 1016 establishes parental involvement requirements that LEA officialscannot meet through the PACs. These include the various provisions formeaningful parent-teacher discussions on children's progress (section 1016(c)(3)),and the various processes suggested in section 1016(c)(5) to involve parentsmore actively in their children's education. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary is aware that while some projects have very active PACs,other projects, for various reasons, do not. If a PAC only nominally exists,or is used sparingly, the LEA almost certainly cannot rely on it to meetits ongoing responsibilities for full parental participation under sections1016 and 1202(a)(4) of the Act. Moreover, if an LEA relies upon a PAC tohelp channel some of its section 1016 responsibilities, it must maintainvigilance to ensure that the PAC operates fully and with purpose. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary also emphasizes that LEA officials that do not operateprojects for the duration of the school year, and so have no statutoryresponsibility to maintain a formal PAC, also must ensure that their projectsare administered and carried out consistent with the section 1016 requirements.Indeed, section 1016(a)(2) of the Act specifically prohibits an LEA fromreceiving any Chapter 1_Migrant Education Program funds unless it ``implementsprograms, activities, and procedures for the involvement of parents'' inits migrant education project. Section 1016(a)(2) also provides that theLEA's methods for obtaining full participation must both be planned andimplemented in consultation with parents, and be ``of sufficient size,scope, and quality to give reasonable promise of substantial progress towardachieving the'' Act's stated goals of parental involvement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 201.36 General Program Requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned the basis for language in proposedandSection; 201.36(a), which would have required the SEA to ensure that thechildren selected for service are those with the greatest need for specialassistance. The commenter stated that the provision conflicted with theservice priority in section 1202(b) that favors services to currently migratorychildren, and provided too much latitude to an SEA or an operating agencyto focus the project on the more easily identified and served formerlymigratory children. Another commenter stressed that sometimes, becauseof the long-term developmental effects of transiency, formerly migratorychildren may have needs greater than those of currently migratory children.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 201.31 (Service priorities) requires currentlymigratory children to receive priority over formerly migratory children``in receipt of services'' under the Migrant Education Program. The servicesto be received, however, are those determined on the basis of an annualassessment of educational need. Although not typical, it is possible thatin isolated circumstances the SEA and its operating agencies may determinethat ``in the consideration of migrant education program activities'' somecurrently migratory children are less in need of services than formerlymigratory children, and so do not warrant receipt of project services.As an extreme example, children who are currently migratory solely becauseof isolated weekend moves (see the discussion in response to comment onandSection; 201.3 (Definitions for this program)) may not have sufficientneeds for special Migrant Education Program services to warrant selectionahead of formerly migratory children who suffer the effects of years ofprevious dislocations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Consequently, the service priorities in andSection; 201.31 must guidestudent selection for projects, but must not do so to the total disregardof the identified needs of individual migrant children who reside in thearea served by the operating agency. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Section 201.36(a) has been revised to require that thechildren selected for services are those, consistent with the service prioritiesin andSection; 201.31, who have the greatest need for special assistance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter stated that the proposed requirement inandSection; 201.36(a), that children be selected on the basis of ``educationallyrelated objective criteria,'' might lead to a failure to identify the needieststudents. The commenter observed that sometimes other factors, ``includingthe long-term developmental effects of transiency,'' often make formerlymigratory children in greater need of assistance than currently migratorychildren. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> As revised, andSection; 201.32(c) (annual needs assessment)requires that SEAs and operating agencies conduct needs assessments forall migrant education projects on the basis of ``educationally relatedobjective criteria.'' Section 201.32(c) directs use of the results of writtenor oral tests, such as traditional standardized tests, for assessing needsof formerly migratory children and, if reasonably possible, currently migratorychildren. Regardless of whether testing is necessary, the use of some appropriateform of objective criteria to conduct needs assessments is a pivotal partof project design and is appropriate in all cases. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, use of these same criteria to select students who will actuallyparticipate in the following year's project may not always be feasible.For example, some migrant children either arrive in school districts wellafter their projects have begun or move to locations where they attendspecial summer programs. The Secretary does not believe that projects designedto serve these children should necessarily delay selecting each projectparticipant until their use of educationally related objective criteriacan confirm that the child's selection is warranted. Therefore, while useof these criteria to confirm that these students warrant project selectionshould be conducted as soon thereafter as reasonably feasible, the Secretarybelieves that andSection; 201.36(a) should provide some flexibility. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, as discussed previously, andSection; 201.31 (service priorities)has been revised to permit projects to serve formerly migratory childrenin advance of currently migratory children if their needs for Migrant EducationProgram services are clearly greater than those of the currently migratorychildren. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Section 201.36(a) now requires that children be selectedfor services ``to the maximum extent possible'' on the basis of the criteriain andSection; 201.32(c) (annual needs assessment). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that proposed andSection; 201.36(d) and (e), regarding services to private school migratory children andcoordination between the migrant education curriculum and the regular instructionalcurriculum, be revised in view of what the commenter believed would bean unwarranted expenditure of resources for the benefit of a very few students.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The SEA is responsible for establishing and operatingprojects that serve all significant concentrations of migratory childrenin the State according to the service priorities in andSection; 201.31. Ifcurrently migratory children attending private schools in a particularlocation are too few to justify their own migrant education project, theSEA does not have to spend Migrant Education Program funds to do so. However,if children attending private schools reside in sufficient numbers to warrantreceipt of migrant education services, coordination of their migrant educationcurriculum with their regular school curriculum is as necessary as forchildren attending public schools. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Paragraph (d) of andSection; 201.36 has been revised toclarify that the SEA must only ensure that services are provided to ``allsignificant concentrations of migratory children enrolled in private schools,consistent with the service priorities in andSection; 201.31.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed difficulty in determining thestatutory basis of each of the general program requirements in andSection;201.36. The commenter recommended that the provisions be revised since,in the commenter's view, they reflected too closely the requirements forthe Chapter 1 Program in LEAs since the Migrant Education Program onlyrequires that projects be administered and carried out ``consistent with''their basic objectives. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The general program requirements in andSection; 201.36all stem from the incorporation into section 1202(a)(3) of the basic objectivesof various specified requirements that govern the Chapter 1 Program inLEAs. Many of these requirements govern LEA application requirements forthat program, but for the SEA-operated Migrant Education Program also representSEA operational requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The specific statutory underpinning of each provision of andSection;201.36 is as follows: andSection; 201.36(a) regarding student selection andidentification of their special educational needs_section 1014(b) (andthe priority favoring currently migratory children in section 1202(b));andSection; 201.36(b) regarding the requisite size, scope, and quality ofmigrant education programs and projects_section 1012(c)(1); andSection; 201.36(c)regarding the use of evaluations to improve program services_the interrelationshipsamong sections 1019 and 1202(a)(6) concerning evaluations and section 1201(a)(1)requiring projects to be designed to meet the special educational needsof migrant students; andSection; 201.36(d) regarding services to migrantchildren attending private school_section 1012(c)(2); andSection; 201.36(e)regarding coordination of the migrant education curriculum with the regularinstructional program_section 1012(c)(3); and andSection; 201.36(f) regardingservices to migratory children who are also of limited English proficiencyor are handicapped_section 1012(c)(4). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary has carefully examined each provision in andSection; 201.36to ensure that the requirements are of sufficient breadth to be adaptableto the Migrant Education Program. Except for the revisions to the proposedregulations explained in response to previous comments, the Secretary hasdetermined that the language and requirements of andSection; 201.36 represent``basic objectives'' of the pertinent statutes governing the Chapter lProgram in LEAs, and pertain to the way the Migrant Education Program shouldoperate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 201.41 Maintenance of Effort </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters questioned the appropriateness of anymaintenance of effort requirement for the State-operated and -administeredMigrant Education Program. One of the commenters stated that andSection;201.41 was unnecessary given the ``supplement not supplant'' provisionin andSection; 201.43. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1202(a)(3) of the Act provides that migranteducation programs and projects ``be administered and carried out in amanner consistent with the basic objectives of section * * * 1018'' ofthe Act. Section 1018(a) contains the maintenance of effort provision,as expressly applicable to the Chapter 1 Program in LEAs. This requirementconditions the full receipt of an LEA's Chapter 1 subgrant on its maintaining,from year to year, the level of State and local funds it spends on freepublic education. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The requirement that the basic objectives of the Chapter 1 maintenanceof effort requirement apply to the Migrant Education Program is not new.Congress enacted identical provisions to govern the Migrant Education Programboth in section 142(a)(3) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Actof 1965, as amended by the Education Amendments of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-561),and in section 19(a) of 1983 technical amendments to the Education Consolidationand Improvement Act of 1981 (Pub. L. 98-211). Thus, Congress has determinedthat even though LEAs have no entitlement to subgrant or suballocationof funds in State-operated programs such as the Migrant Education Programthe requirement that LEAs maintain fiscal effort still exists.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While related, maintenance of effort and supplement, not supplantrequirements serve different purposes. Unlike maintenance of effort, whichfocuses solely on aggregate levels of LEA expenditures, the supplement,not supplant requirement prohibits LEAs from using Chapter 1 funds to replacethe State and local funds that, in the absence of Chapter 1 funding, wouldbe spent on programs for Chapter 1 students. Consequently, the supplement,not supplant provisions of andSection; 201.43 cannot substitute for the maintenanceof effort requirement in andSection; 201.41 (and andSection; 201.42). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters strongly objected to what one commenterconsidered to be the ``burdensome paperwork'' that proposed andSection; 201.41would entail, particularly for LEAs operating only summer projects.

Thecommenter stated that he understood that most LEAs do not receive subgrantsfor indirect costs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1018(a) of the statute provides that noncompliancewith the maintenance of effort requirement will have consequences to theLEAs. For the LEA-operated Chapter 1 Program in LEAs, the penalty expressedin section 1018(a) of the Act, a pro rata reduction in the amount of theLEA's grant, is logical. However, this penalty is incompatible with theState-operated nature of the Migrant Education Program, particularly becauseLEAs are not entitled to subgrants. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As explained in the supplemental information that accompanied publicationof the NPRM (54 FR 3927-28), the Secretary proposed the penalty in andSection;201.41(b) because that penalty appeared to comport with the basic objectiveof the maintenance of effort requirement_to create incentives for maintaininglevels of non-Federal support by reducing levels of program support tothose who did not. Despite the commenter's perception that many LEAs donot receive subgrants for indirect costs, the Secretary understands thatmany LEAs do charge a portion of their Migrant Education Program subgrantsto the indirect costs of operating their programs on the basis of an establishedformal indirect cost rate that comports with that in 34 CFR 75.564 through75.568. The Secretary expects that program reviews, audit reports, andcommunications from SEAs and LEAs will highlight whether this penalty needsto be revised. However, until a demonstrated need for a different penaltyfor noncompliance arises, and thereafter further study of how better toimplement the maintenance of effort requirement yields a more suitablepenalty, the Secretary has determined to retain the penalty contained inandSection; 201.41(b). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 201.42 Waiver of the Maintenance of Effort Requirement </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> A number of commenters considered this provision overlyprescriptive and incompatible with the language of section 1202(a)(3) ofthe Act that migrant education projects be administered in a manner ``consistentwith the basic objectives'' of section 1018(a). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 201.42(a)(1) permits an SEA to waive an LEA'smaintenance of effort requirement only once because of unforeseen or uncontrollablecircumstances the LEA faces. Because maintenance of effort is tied to thetotal of an LEA's non-Federal resources spent on public education, andan agency operating a Chapter 1 LEA Program is entitled to only one waiver,the Secretary has determined that it would be illogical to permit a greaternumber of waivers under the Migrant Education Program. Consequently, theSecretary has determined that no further regulatory flexibility in andSection;201.42 is available. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 201.44 Comparability </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters questioned the rationale for proposingto implement the comparability requirement at the LEA level in a State-operatedprogram. Another commenter specifically questioned why a comparabilityrequirement is appropriate for a small program in which one paraprofessionalprovides all migrant education services to all the LEA's migrant children.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> As with maintenance of effort, Congress in section1202(a)(3) of the Act has re-enacted the requirement that migrant educationprograms and projects be administered and carried out consistent with thebasic objectives of the section 1018(c) comparability requirements. Becausecomparability measures the levels of State and local resources providedto support programs for similarly situated Chapter 1 and non-Chapter 1students attending schools in a particular school district, the requirementcannot be implemented through statewide comparisons, and is not met byproviding all of the LEA's migrant children the same level of Migrant EducationProgram services. However, consistent with section 1018(c) of the Act,the SEA is able, as it is for the Chapter 1 Program in LEAs, to monitorLEAs to ensure that migratory students attending their schools receiveequivalent levels of State and locally funded services as do nonmigratorystudents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter expressed confusion about whether the proposalin andSection; 201.44(a), that the LEA provide comparable levels of servicesto migrant students as to ``students in the same grades who are not receivingmigrant program funds,'' referred to grades in the school migrant childrenattend or grades in all schools the LEA operates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>The comparability requirement is intended to ensurethat programs in which migrant children are enrolled are given levels ofState and locally funded services that are comparable to levels of servicesprovided for programs in which non-migrants are enrolled.

Commenters, includingboth SEA and LEA officials, believed that the provision undercuts the authorityof the SEA to administer and operate the State's migrant education program.The commenters pointed particularly to (1) the provisions of andSection;201.46(c), which they interpreted as precluding State determinations inmatters such as the grade levels the migrant education projects shouldserve, and (2) the requirement in andSection; 201.46(e) that a committeeof practitioners shall review any State rules or regulations relating tothe Migrant Education Program before they are published. One commenteralso questioned the practicality of having a committee of practitionersreview proposed State rules or regulations that would apply only to short-termsummer projects. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Commenters felt that the purpose of the underlying statute, section1451 of the Act, as applied to the Migrant Education Program through the``basic objectives'' language of section 1202(a)(3), was merely to ensurelocal involvement in planning of local projects and development of theapplications to support them. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary sympathizes with the commenters' concernsthat section 1451, after which andSection; 201.46 was modeled, is a sourceof tension for those Federal, State, and local migrant education officialswho have understood their program to be State-administered and State-operated.As discussed in response to the general comment on the part 201 proposedregulations, it is true that only the ``basic objectives'' of the provisionneed apply to the administration and implementation of migrant educationprojects. However, the express limitations on State rulemaking in namedareas of local decisions and the requirement that a formal State committeeof practitioners review rules or regulations before they are issued applyto all Chapter 1 programs, including the Migrant Education Program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In seeking to resolve the question of the nature of section 1451'sapplicability to the Migrant Education Program, the Secretary has foundno indication in Public Law 100-297 or its legislative history to indicatea congressional desire to preclude SEA decisionmaking in areas that havetraditionally been accepted as State responsibilities. In this regard,the Department's Office of Migrant Education has long considered <T3>all </T3>activities conducted at the State or local level in the planning,design, implementation and evaluation of migrant education programs andprojects to be part of SEA administration and operation, and the Secretaryunderstands this view to be widely accepted. The Secretary therefore addressesthe issues raised by section 1451 of the Act, regarding (a) limitationson State rulemaking and (b) the committee of practitioners, within thiscontext. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. <T3>The ``limitations'' on State rulemaking. </T3>Section 201.46(c) ofthe NPRM sought to resolve the dilemma by providing that the section 1451preclusions on State rulemaking in the specified areas of LEA decisionswould apply ``unless [State rules, regulations, or policies were] neededto implement SEA responsibilities in an approved State application or inthe Chapter l statute or regulations.'' The supplemental information accompanyingthe NPRM (54 FR 3925) stated that this provision was proposed because ``theSEA must be able to retain authority to establish rules and policies thatlegitimately relate to its statutory responsibility for administering andoperating the State's migrant education program.'' The intent of the provisionwas to continue to permit the SEA to implement legitimate activities underits State's migrant education program through the kinds of policies andrules it considered necessary to meet its responsibilities for operatingthe State program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Department received no specific comment on andSection; 201.46(c).However, the Secretary has revised andSection; 201.46(c) by including a newparagraph (c)(2), which clarifies the breadth of SEA decisionmaking. UnderandSection; 201.46(c)(2), the only reasons an SEA would be unable to issuerules or policies in the specified areas of grade levels to be served,skills to be addressed, and others described in andSection; 201.46(c)(1),would be a conscious SEA decision to refrain from stepping into these areas.In effect, all Migrant Education Program decisions at the State or locallevels are ``SEA decisions'' unless the SEA decides to delegate them tolocal operating agencies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. <T3>The committee of practitioners. </T3>Section 1451(b) expressly requiresState rulemaking under any Chapter 1 program to be reviewed by a committeeof practitioners. The Secretary has determined that while the manner ofreview of State migrant education program rules or regulations may be leftto State discretion, nothing about the Migrant Education Program is inconsistentwith the congressional desire to have broad discussion of any State rule,for the regular school year or summer school programs, before it is issued.Where expense is a major consideration, the SEA is free to use the leastcostly method available to obtain the committee's review, and may use acommittee already empaneled for purposes of reviewing rules and policiesfor the Chapter 1 Program in LEAs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>Section 201.46(c) has been revised to clarify that decisionsabout the operation of the State's migrant education program do not become``LEA decisions'' unless the SEA so determines. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters questioned the relationship betweenthe committee of practitioners and the existing State parent advisory council,with which the SEA already must consult in planning and developing theState's migrant education programs and projects. Commenters stated thatthe work of the committee of practitioners would be duplicative of thework of that council. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>The committee of practitioners is much more broadlybased than the State parent advisory council. Moreover, unlike the council,the composition of the committee of practitioners will include a majorityof LEA representatives, who will be able to represent the specific interestsof those local agencies during the State rulemaking process. Parent advisorycouncil members ensure the involvement of another important constituency,parents of migratory children. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes: </T3>None.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1451(b) of the Act requires that a State committeeof practitioners review before publication any proposed or final Staterule or regulation relating to the administration and operation of programsunder this part. In addition, the Act requires that the State convene thecommittee to review an emergency regulation prior to issuance in finalform. On further consideration, the Secretary recognizes the inconsistencyin requiring a State to convene a committee to review emergency rules andregulations while not requiring that the committee be convened to reviewother regulations. However, the Secretary is concerned with the undue burdenthat will be placed on States if the committee must be convened to reviewall rules and regulations. Therefore, the Secretary believes that the mostappropriate way to carry out the intent of the Act and reduce undue burdenis to require that the State convene the committee to review all majorrules and regulations. All other rules and regulations must be reviewedby the committee before publication but not necessarily in a meeting. Inaddition, in a State that does not issue rules or regulations relatingto the administration and operation of programs under this part but issuespolicies that the SEA and local operating agencies are required to follow,the State must comply with the consultation requirements for issuing rulesand regulations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Section 201.46(e) has been revised to require a Stateto convene the committee of practitioners to review any major proposedor final rule or regulations that the SEA and local operating agenciesare required to follow in administering and implementing programs underthis part.

While in some locationsmigrant education staff may work with far fewer students than other staff,the Secretary does not believe this alone is sufficient cause to limitthe scope of the regulations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In view of the congressional desire that the Chapter 1 teachers, affectedby andSection; 201.49 (and section 1452 of the Act), be permitted assignmentto duties that are broader than those normally considered to be ``supervisory,''the title has been revised to refer to ``non-Chapter 1'' duties ratherthan supervisory duties. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> The heading of andSection; 201.49 has been modified accordingly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Sections 201.51 through 201.56 Evaluation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters emphasized that they believed theproposed evaluation requirements to be overly prescriptive, an undue datacollection burden, and too similar to the program requirements governingevaluations in andSection;andSection; 200.80 through 200.86 for the Chapter1 Program in LEAs. These commenters generally believed that the proposedregulations were insensitive to the special conditions of migratory children,particularly those with limited English proficiency. One commenter expressedconcern that since SEAs administer and operate migrant education programson a statewide basis, the regulations did not provide them with adequateflexibility. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1435 of the Act requires the Secretary toset national standards for evaluating for all Chapter 1 programs. Theseregulations provide those minimum standards. States are not precluded,if they desire greater flexibility, from mandating additional evaluationrequirements that promote better program improvement. The Secretary believesthat the proposed regulations governing Migrant Education Program evaluationdid recognize the uniqueness of the migratory child population served bythe program. The proposed regulations varied from those established forthe Chapter 1 Program in LEAs in several ways, bearing more similarityto the provisions applicable to bilingual education in andSection;andSection;500.50 through 500.52 of the Department's regulations, while still adheringto the basic objectives of the requirements for evaluation contained inthe Chapter 1 statute. In particular, the proposed rules considered thespecial effect that the mobility of some currently migratory children mayhave on individual migrant education projects, particularly those operatedin summer months. The Secretary continues to believe that the regular schoolyear projects that serve formerly migratory children do not present evaluationproblems substantially greater than those encountered under the Chapter1 Program in LEAs. Furthermore, there are significant numbers of currentlymigratory children who either remain in their home base school districtlong enough to participate in its testing program or arrive in a receivingschool at the time of its districtwide testing program. For projects withthese currently migratory children, standardized test scores can be collectedin the same ways as in the Chapter 1 Program in LEAs. Therefore, even thoughsome currently migratory children may be missed by these testing procedures,this number will be fewer than the commenters believed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 1435 of the Act directs the Secretary to develop nationalevaluation standards for the Migrant Education Program, which presumablyshould complement express SEA responsibilities to implement the evaluationrequirements in section 1202(a)(6) of the Act. However, the Secretary alsounderstands the commenters' concerns about potential difficulties in implementingthe proposed requirements. Therefore, the Secretary has decided to permitadded flexibility in evaluations by permitting SEAs and LEAs to measurethe overall progress of migrant children served by the State's migranteducation programs and projects. The Secretary is satisfied that sincethe SEAs have long been responsible for (1) evaluating their migrant educationprograms and projects in a manner of their choosing, (2) using these evaluationsto improve their programs, and (3) making the results of these evaluationspublic, the use of procedures prescribed in these regulations should notcreate an undue data collection burden upon the SEAs or their operatingagencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Subpart E of these regulations has been revised by modifyingandSection; 201.51(a) and 201.52 to allow the SEA and its local operatingagencies to measure the overall progress of the State's migrant educationprogram, including the extent of educational progress achieved throughthe projects, in terms of basic and more advanced skills. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 201.51 Evaluation and Demographic Reports </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter objected to the inconsistency between therequirement that LEAs report their evaluation results every three yearsand the requirement that SEAs submit evaluation reports to the Secretaryevery two years. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 1019 of the Act requires that the resultsof local evaluations be submitted to the SEA at least once during a three-yearperiod. While this provision is not incorporated directly into section1202 of the Act as a requirement of those administering migrant educationprojects, the provision is generally cited in section 1012 of the Act (governingLEA applications), whose basic objectives are incorporated into section1202(a)(3). Therefore, the Secretary has determined not only that localprojects have an evaluation requirement, but that the section 1019 provisionthat it evaluate its project at least every three years applies to migranteducation projects as well. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In accordance with section 1019(b) of the Act, the SEA is expresslyrequired to conduct evaluations (based upon local evaluation data collectedunder 1202(a)(6)) at least every two years. Therefore section 1019(b) plainlyrequires separate Migrant Education Program evaluations every two years,a schedule that comports with the Secretary's responsibility under section1435(b) of the Act to report to the Congress on a similar two-year schedule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In trying to mesh the inconsistences between the two-year State evaluationand the potentially three-year local evaluation, andSection; 201.51 permitsthe SEA to require operating agencies to report more frequently than onceevery three years.

The commenterquestioned how, given the impact of a migrant lifestyle, one can determineif improved performance has been sustained. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> Section 201.52(a)(2) applies only to formerly migratorychildren who have participated in a full school-year program for at leasttwo years. The regulations reflect the underlying requirement in section1019(a)(3) of the Act. The Secretary has determined that, since the regulationsapply only to formerly migratory children who, by definition, have notmigrated for at least two years, it is feasible for operating agenciesto collect the uniform data the regulations specify. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned the reasonableness of collectingseparate evaluation data for both instructional and support services, asproposed andSection; 201.52 (a) and (b) would require. The commenter feltthat, for the Migrant Education Program, these two types of services aretoo intertwined to permit separate assessments of their effectiveness.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary realizes that the benefits derivingfrom instructional and support services are intertwined, and that a measureof the success of one may be a measure of success of the other. However,most SEAs and operating agencies formally describe their migrant educationprograms and projects in terms of separate instructional and support activities.The purpose of the regulatory provision is only to require collection ofdata on the success of each of these project components. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> Some commenters questioned the use of ``pre'' and ``post''normed test results as objective measures of the effectiveness of migranteducation programs and projects, claiming that resulting matched scoreswill not be representative of the successes of the program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary recognizes that assessing the effectivenessof the migrant education programs and projects and the achievement of participatingchildren presents challenges to SEAs and operating agencies. The Secretary,however, believes these challenges can be met, and that the extent of educationalprogress of migratory children can be determined for both currently andformerly migratory children participating in the regular school year programand those who may participate in the summer school projects. The regulationsdo not limit the objective measures of educational progress to nationallynormed standardized achievement tests (or to the ``pre'' and ``post'' normedtest results the commenter described). They acknowledge that other evaluationinstruments, including those with State norms, may provide a valid measureof the progress of migratory children. Examples of objective measures otherthan standardized achievement tests include, as appropriate depending uponthe objectives of the particular project, changes in attendance patternsindicating less frequent absenteeism and tardiness, declining course dropoutand school dropout rates, and more frequent usage of library books andresource materials. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Sections 201.51 and 201.52 have been revised to clarifythat SEAs and operating agencies must measure or assess the overall progressof both the instructional component, including the extent of educationalprogress achieved by its students, and support components of their Chapter1 migrant education projects. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 201.52 Evaluation Information to Be Collected and Section201.54 Non-Project Comparison Groups </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comment:</T3> A number of commenters were concerned about the proposalto require the use of appropriate non-project comparison groups in thecollection of evaluation information. They expressed the view that theevaluation requirement may be very difficult to implement because of thelack of any appropriate non-project comparison group for migratory children.Another indicated that migratory children are decidedly different fromthe regular school population in ethnicity, language proficiency, agesin grade, and socioeconomic status and questioned the statutory basis forrequiring use of non-project comparison groups. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Several commenters stated, as did the previous commenter, that limitedEnglish proficiency is an obstacle for making nonproject comparisons. Incontrast, another commenter stated that evaluations of the Migrant EducationProgram should incorporate outcomes for migratory children served by Chapter1, bilingual education, or other programs, as well as outcomes that directlystem from instructional services provided with Migrant Education Programfunds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary believes that it is essential that theeducational progress of migratory children receiving Migrant EducationProgram services be measured, to the maximum extent possible, using objectivemeasures of gain. Indeed, educational progress in the regular school programcan really only be measured against benchmarks uniformly applied to themigratory student population. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Two benchmarks are possible. One is a national or State norm basedupon all students of a given age or grade. The other is an appropriateSEA or operating agency non-project comparison group. In addressing theways in which either standard bears upon evaluation design, it is usefulto examine separately (1) the form of the non-project comparison group,and (2) the different components, instructional and support-service, ofmigrant education programs and projects to be evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. <T3>The non-project comparison group. </T3>It is sensible, if possible,to assess the performance of children who are served by migrant educationprograms and projects in comparison to the most similar groups availablethat receive no program assistance. For example, if the dominant characteristicsof the migratory students whom a project serves are academic deficiencyand non-English proficiency, the agency should try to compare their performancewith the group of non-migratory students, if one is available, who mostshare those characteristics. Doing so will provide good information onthe benefits that the migrant education programs and projects have produced.Therefore, pursuant to section 1425(a) of the Act, the Secretary has determinedthat use of appropriate non-project comparison groups may be necessaryfor evaluating the overall progress of migrant education programs and projects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, while proposed andSection; 201.54 would have required the nonprojectcomparison group to include persons with characteristics and backgrounds``similar'' to those of the migrant children participating in the project,the Secretary is satisfied that for some SEAs and operating agencies similargroups may not always exist. The Secretary understands that for some migratorychildren, particularly the actively mobile currently migratory children,an appropriate non-project comparison group, and data on that group, maybe difficult to secure. Therefore, andSection; 201.54(a) has been revisedto define the non-project comparison group as consisting of those who ``areas similar as possible'' in characteristics and background. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. <T3>Use of the non-project comparison group or the national or State normedachievement test in evaluating the instructional and support-service componentsof migrant education projects. </T3>Even so, the Secretary also recognizesthat if the results of national or State normed achievement tests for agiven age or grade of child are available, requiring the use of a non-projectcomparison group as a means of evaluating migrant student achievement maygenerate costs and difficulties that are not commensurate to the benefitsobtained. Therefore, in response to the comments, the Secretary has revisedandSection; 201.52(b) to permit, for migrant education instructional projectsoperating throughout the regular school year, SEAs and operating agenciesto conduct evaluations using ``appropriate forms and levels of nationalor State normed achievement tests.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Only if those agencies do not use those achievement tests must theycompare performance of migratory students to the performance of an appropriatenon-project comparison group. Because instructional projects operatingonly over the summer term cannot reasonably be evaluated in terms of thesenational or State normed achievement tests, the Secretary has retained,in andSection; 201.32(c), the requirement proposed in andSection; 201.32(a)(2)of the NPRM that summer school projects be evaluated ``to the extent possible,''by comparing project results to those of a non-project comparison group.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If, for any instructional components of migrant education programsand projects, evaluations are conducted with an appropriate non-projectcomparison group, andSection; 201.54(b) requires an SEA or operating agencyto use standardized achievement tests based on national or State normativedata only ``to the extent possible.'' (The provision deletes the proposedalternate use of ``local normed achievement data,'' contained in proposedandSection; 201.54(b), because that data likely does not exist and, in anyevent, would frustrate development of common standards for a statewideevaluation.) However, if possible, the Secretary strongly recommends useof standardized norm-referenced tests to fulfill the requirement. Use ofthese tests, with the most reasonable non-project comparison group thatis available, will at least provide some kind of measure, where none mayotherwise exist, of the success of a migrant education program and theoverall progress of its participants. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Whether based on national or State norms these comparisons also (1)can provide measures of the participants' ability to function in localmainstream classrooms with their non-migratory peers, and (2) can helpdetermine whether participants in migrant education projects function atthe level of established State or local standards. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Use of the Technical Assistance Centers (TACs), funded under section1436(d) of the Act, and the Rural Technical Assistance Centers (R-TACs),established under section 1456 of the Act, are available to assist SEAsand operating agencies in selecting appropriate non-project comparisongroups, and appropriate norm-referenced testing procedures, to fulfillthis regulatory requirement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, the Secretary also recognizes that some project support-servicecomponents, such as clothing and health care, do not easily lend themselvesto evaluation through the use of a non-project comparison group, whileothers, such as those that promote dropout prevention or reading, may welldo so. Therefore, with minor modifications, andSection; 201.32(d) retainsthe requirement proposed in andSection; 201.32(b) of the NPRM that the evaluationdesign for support-service components include ``if possible, a means ofcomparing project outcomes to the performance of an appropriate non-projectcomparison group.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Sections 201.52(b) and 201.54 have been revised accordingly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 202.53 General Technical Standards for Evaluation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments:</T3> A commenter recommended that evaluations of the MigrantEducation Program be conducted at the national level, rather than at theState and local levels, by persons skilled in evaluation who have a thoroughknowledge of the unique population the program serves. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary is planning to conduct a number of nationalstudies to examine various issues related to the operation and effectsof the Migrant Education Program. At the same time, provisions of the Act,such as sections 1019, 1202(a)(6), and 1435, emphasize both that localand State level evaluations are necessary for purposes of accountabilityand program improvement, and that their performance is a responsibilityof the SEA and local operating agencies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> None. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 201.55 Submission of Sampling Plans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter suggested that States not be requiredto submit sampling plans for prior approval by the Secretary.

Rather than prescribing the sampling proceduresto be used, the regulations provide SEAs flexibility to design samplingsystems most appropriate for their States. Section 201.55 requires thatSEAs submit their sampling plans to the Secretary for approval so thatthe Secretary can be satisfied, consistent with responsibilities imposedunder section 1435 of the Act, that the statewide evaluation data thatis obtained will be representative of the State's migrant education programsand projects.

The regulations in part85 were adopted in two separate rulemaking actions. First, under ExecutiveOrder 12549, 27 executive agencies joined together to promulgate commonregulations authorizing debarment and suspension of individuals and organizationsfrom nonprocurement programs of the U.S. Government. The Department implementedthis Executive order in subparts A through E of part 85 (regular debarmentand suspension) (53 FR 19161 (May 26, 1988)). Second, under the Drug-FreeWorkplace Act of 1988, the 27 agencies were joined by seven other agenciesto issue debarment and suspension regulations implementing the new Act.The Department implements the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 in subpartF of part 85 (drug-free debarment and suspension) (54 FR 4946 (January31, 1989)). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The regular debarment and suspension regulations provide that statutoryentitlements and mandatory awards (but not subtier awards thereunder whichare not themselves mandatory) are not covered by the debarment and suspensionregulations (34 CFR 85.110(a)(2)(i)). The Secretary has concluded thatthis exception from coverage precludes the Secretary from denying fundingunder this or any other State-administered program based on a regular debarmentor suspension. The exception also would prevent the Department from denyingassistance to a subgrantee under this program or any other program in whichsubgrantees are entitled to funds if they meet certain requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While the Department could not cut off funds to a State or mandatorysubgrantee, the Secretary has determined that all lower tier covered transactions,such as the employment of an administrator (a covered transaction under34 CFR 85.110(a)(1)(ii)(A)), would be subject to the debarment and suspensionregulations. Such a debarment would not prohibit the receipt of funds bythe State or mandatory subgrantee. However, the debarment would prohibitthe subject individual from acting as a principal (as defined by 34 CFR85.105(p)) for the State or subgrantee or from participating in any othercovered transaction under nonprocurement programs of the Federal Government.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As a result, if the Department discovered any activity by an administratorpaid from program funds that would constitute grounds for debarment, thedebarring official for the Department would take action to debar the individual.Further, if a State continued to do business with the individual, the Departmentwould consider issuing a Program Determination Letter to the State to recoverthe program funds. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Given these conclusions, the Secretary has determined that the Departmentmust collect primary tier certifications from grantees under this and otherState-administered programs. Under 34 CFR 85.510(a), however, a State needonly certify as to its principals. The OMB-approved forms used by the Departmentat this time for primary tier transactions do not yet indicate that theyapply only to principals. The Department will submit to OMB for approvala new form that would apply only to principals of a State. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Similarly, as to mandatory subgrantees, States must collect the lowertier certifications from both mandatory and discretionary lower tier participants.As with the primary tier certifications submitted by States under thisprogram, the Department will submit a new lower tier certification formto OMB for approval that would apply only to principals of mandatory subgrantees.However, pending approval of the new forms, the Department will use thecurrent forms with the understanding that they apply only to principalsof States under State-administered programs and to principals of mandatorysubgrantees under State-administered programs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The drug-free debarment and suspension regulations require all granteesreceiving a grant from any Federal agency to certify that they will maintaina drug-free workplace. The regulations do not apply to subgrantees. TheDepartment has authority to deny funds under entitlement programs to granteesthat fail to meet these requirements. Regarding the State certificationsrequired under these regulations, the Department will continue to use currentlyapproved forms. Because the regulations do not apply to subgrantees, thereis no need for States to take any other action to fully implement the requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Changes:</T3> Section 201.2 has been revised to reference the applicabilityof 34 CFR part 85.
