Bob Chandler looks forward to the daywhen his adopted daughter can live with his family again. RhondaStanton looks forward to the day her adopted daughter can live withsomeone else.   Their stories differ, but both tell of a dark side of adoption:   ``The excitement of adopting, falling in love with a child,wanting the child desperately and deeply, and going through thegrief of learning you're not going to have the child you dreamedabout,'' Chandler said.   Dan and Rhonda Stanton returned 2{-year-old Stacey to theadoption agency after learning her brain had ceased developing.Stacey lives with a foster family, but a judge has ruled theStantons cannot sever their parental ties.   Bob and Cherry Chandler sent their daughter away for counselingfor sexual abuse she suffered before adoption _ abuse they blamefor breaking apart the family. They and five other sets of adoptiveparents are suing the state for failing to disclose the extent oftheir children's pre-adoption abuse.   ``Lack of information can destabilize an adoption that wouldhave otherwise been successful,'' said Richard Barth, associateprofessor at the University of California-Berkeley School of SocialWelfare.   Barth and an associate followed 1,000 adoptive families in1980-1984 and found that the less information families had abouttheir children, the likelier were such problems as runaways,disobedience or physical attacks.   Ten percent to 15 percent of adoptions are stopped beforethey're finalized and ``a smaller minority'' are dissolved,estimated Jeff Rosenberg, director of public policy for theNational Commitee for Adoption, a Washington-based, non-profitgroup of adoption agencies, parents, children and experts.   The Stantons, who have been married 11 years, explored adoptionafter exhausting all means to conceive. Their disappointment turnedto anticipation when they learned in 1985 that the private adoptionagency Hope Cottage was seeking 50 adoptive couples.   In October 1986, 3-week-old Stacey came to their suburban Dallashome.   ``The moment she was placed in our arms, she was our baby,''said Stanton, 39, an insurance agent. But Stacey's mentaldevelopment stopped at four to six months, said Mrs. Stanton. ``Shenever learned to wave bye-bye, play patty-cake. Little Stacey nevertuned in.''   By the time tests revealed Stacey would never develop, theStantons had adopted her. Stacey went back to Hope Cottage lastJune, but Mrs. Stanton says emphatically, ``We didn't return her,we gave her up.''   Last July they asked Dallas Family Court Judge Hal Gaither tolegally declare the child not theirs. In February, they toldGaither they were not equipped to raise a severely retarded child.   ``I have a deep compassion for special children, but I don'thave the emotional makeup to teach them,'' said Mrs. Stanton, 41, aformer elementary schoolteacher.   ``Where do you draw the line?'' Gaither said recently. ``Do youallow the adoption agency to come back and pick up kids becausethey cry at night or if it has blue eyes and you wanted green eyes?No. You can't turn a child back in.''   Gaither terminated the Stantons' visitation rights and relievedthem of financial responsibility, but refused to erase theirparental rights in case the adoption agency later had its ownfinancial or business problems. ``What if ... an adoption agencyagrees to take a child back into custody ... and they go bankruptor a new regime comes in and won't honor the contract, now where isthe kid?,'' he said.   The Stantons say they endured painful criticism from friends andjudgment by strangers because of their highly publicized case.   ``People said they could never give up their child, but theywere thinking of their little normal children,'' Mrs. Stanton said.``I know even as I try to explain, they can't realize the pain. Weliterally cried from the time we woke up to the time we went tobed.''   Chandler, minister of Highlands Christian Church in Dallas, sayshe can understand. The first day his new daughter walked into theirhome, she picked up markers and drew all over the carpet. Later,she began lying and stealing. One day she threatened to kill theChandlers' two biological sons.   ``Kids threaten,'' Chandler said. ``But there was a look in hereye, a rage in her face that was horrifying.''   Chandler, who decided to adopt because it was a Christian thingto do, admits that as he tried to cope with his daughter's violentbehavior he thought about taking her back to the Texas Departmentof Human Services.   After many visits with counselors, the Chandlers finally found aColorado psychiatrist who said the girl's behavior was the resultof sexual abuse. She has been undergoing treatment at the Coloradoclinic since January; the Chandlers don't know when she'll be ableto come home.   The Human Services Department revealed in a three-page summaryof the girl's case that she had been abused, but not the extent ofher mistreatment, Chandler said. ``The information we received wasvery, very general.''   With their lawsuit, the Chandlers and five other families hopeto force the state to give prospective parents more backgroundabout adoptable children.   A federal judge has ruled against the parents, saying they haveno constitutional right to the information they seek. Their appealis pending before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in NewOrleans.   Health Services officials have declined to talk specificallyabout the Chandler case while it is pending, but spokeswoman DianeScott said the agency has always told parents what type of home achild came from and how the child came into custody of the agency,as required by the Texas Family Code.   The department must provide information on the child's health,social, educational and genetic history, but can summarize thatbackground.   Caseworkers also discuss any medical or psychological treatmentthe child has undergone, Ms. Scott said. ``We also encourage thefamilies to talk with the child's physician or therapist tounderstand the implications of the child's condition and need fortreatment.''   The Texas Senate has passed a bill that would give parents theright to see copies of all the children's records, edited toprotect birth parents. Adopted children would be able to see thedocuments at adulthood.   The Chandlers aren't sure if they would have adopted theirdaughter had they known her history, but they believe theinformation could have helped them address her problems sooner.   The Stantons say they would like to have some part in Stacey'slife again when they are stronger, but they are unlikely to adoptagain.   ``We can love again,'' Mrs. Stanton said, ``but that joy andexcitement she brought into our life _ you don't replace it.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, May 15</NOTE></DOC>
