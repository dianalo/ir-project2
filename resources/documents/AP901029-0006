(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 1,200-pound polar bear called Majorwill lose his home next month. So will elderly orangutans Stanleyand Betty, and a skinny Siberian tiger named Sasha. The 85-year-oldStone Zoo is closing because of state budget cuts.   ``You can't help (but) develop attachments to the animals,''said Mark Goldstein, the zoo's director. ``You think of them asindividuals.''   The zoo in this Boston suburb was already running on ashoestring, when its budget was slashed by 30 percent from lastyear because of the state's financial problems. Zoo officialsdecided to close Nov. 12 rather than house the animals in shoddyconditions.   ``There are things worse than no zoo, like a bad zoo,''Goldstein said.   About half the zoo's 200 or so residents will find homes at theFranklin Park Zoo, the larger of the two facilities run byMetroParks Zoos. Some will be moved to other zoos around thecountry.   But some are just too old or too big to relocate easily.   ``For some, it will take months to find them a good home,''Goldstein said. ``But we won't let them end up in privatecollections. And we hope none will have to be euthanized.''   Large meat-eaters are expensive to feed and maintain, said JohnLinehan, curator of mammals for the MetroParks Zoos.   That doesn't help Major, who eats about 14 pounds of meat andbiscuits a day - when he's on a diet.   Sasha has an enzyme problem that leaves her a little on theskinny side. And though lions and tigers are increasingly scarce inthe wild, they are actually fairly abundant in U.S. zoos.   Orangutans Stanley, 31, and Betty, 30, look like a pair ofsad-eyed, rust-haired Buddhas sitting quietly in their separateglass enclosures.   But they are more mischievous than tranquil.   ``Betty steals tools and you have to trade them back,'' Linehansaid. ``She gets a brush and starts scrubbing the walls like we do.She won't go through doors she wants you to go through. She demandsa lot of attention.''   The two primates have been together 20 years and produced fouroffspring. But they'll probably be separated when the zoo closes.   Stanley may return to Brookfield Zoo near Chicago, his firsthome, but Betty's future is less clear, since she is old, fat andhas an abdominal cyst that has left her unable to reproduce.   But don't think the separation will leave either orangheartbroken, keepers said.   ``Betty steals Stanley's toys,'' Linehan said. ``Stanley isnice, except when he wants to have his way with Betty. They won'tmiss each other.''   Wherever he ends up, Stanley will be ``happy to have femalesaround,'' said Linehan. ``He's pretty feisty for his age.''   Goldstein hopes that Stone Zoo can reopen someday. A bill in theLegislature would take the zoo out of state control and make it apublic, non-profit corporation, similar to a structure used by mostother successful zoos nationwide.   But for now the outlook isn't bright, for the zoo's animals orits patrons.   Thelma Dennis, 69, has been a volunteer zoo tour guide forchildren for the past 11 years.   ``Of course I'm awfully sad,'' Dennis said. ``This is the realthing, or next to the real thing. Kids can't get the same feelingfor an animal on TV that they can seeing them here.''   ``We're trying to get kids off the streets and we're taking awaythe zoos, the museums,'' said Goldstein.   ``You can be 75 years old and want to take a 3-year-old out forthe day,'' he added. ``I challenge you to find something else you'dboth enjoy.''</TEXT></DOC>
