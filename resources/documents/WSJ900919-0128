From the refinements of Versailles to the last word inbloody revolution, from high fashion to high-tech in theshape of the world's fastest train, it has provedunpredictable, but interesting. And then, there is thatfamous way of life, happily blending -- so we are often told-- sexual liberation and gastronomical bliss.   None of this has escaped Richard Bernstein. The formerhead of the Paris bureau of the New York Times, Mr. Bernsteinwas not only interested in France and the French, he also hadaccess to people and places well beyond the ordinarytraveler's ken; and the result, surprisingly, is a hymn oflove. Of course, like the good journalist he is, Mr.Bernstein retains his objectivity: Shortcomings are listed aswell as achievements; the peculiarities of the Frenchpolitical system -- essentially an elective monarchy -- arecarefully analyzed; and the descriptions of the French onholiday are enough to make the blood run cold.</LP><TEXT>   Still, &quot;Fragile Glory: A Portrait of France and theFrench&quot; (Knopf, 349 pages, $24.95) is a paean to thelandscapes, the villages, the traditions and the people ofFrance. Better yet, Mr. Bernstein set out to disprove a mythhe encountered early. &quot;The French,&quot; he notes, &quot;like to thinkof themselves as just a bit inscrutable, especially tooutsiders.&quot; He shows us just how the French differ from oneanother and from us, and why.   The place to start, contrary to tradition, is not Paris.Most Parisians, still today, have roots deep in thecountryside; and Mr. Bernstein's summary of &quot;la FranceProfonde&quot; (deep France) is nothing short of superb as hetakes us around the country, from village to village andregion to region. His descriptions of the landscape oftenverge on the lyrical: &quot;The Luberon Valley in Provence,&quot; hewrites, &quot;is an arid region of pastel colors, of mottled pinkland, of olive and fig groves and vineyards that turn scarletin the autumn, the ensemble of colors mingling harmoniouslylike those on the printed cotton cloth manufactured in theregion.&quot; Even better, he then goes on to interview andobserve people with a mixture of sympathy and detachment; andthe conversations he has with farmers and town dwellers alikecombine to offer the reader an unusually vivid and precisepicture of rural France.   The same is true of Paris. But while Mr. Bernstein'sfondness for the city is evident, he does not allow it tosway him. &quot;In some ways, Paris's long moment has finallypassed,&quot; he writes, accurately, as he goes on to note thecity's lack of &quot;creative audacity.&quot; And when it comes tojudging its intellectuals and their productions, he is quiterightly pitiless, mentioning, among other factors, theimportance of subjects the French themselves call&quot;franco-francais&quot;, Franco-French -- i.e., of no interest toanyone anywhere else.   All this, however, just sets the scene: From there, thebook goes on to the French character, with its sometimesappealing, sometimes maddening characteristics. What Mr.Bernstein calls the &quot;R5 complex&quot; (after the small Renault) isa hair-raising description and a brilliant analysis of theJekyll-and-Hyde-like transformation the French undergo whendriving a car. &quot;Gallic Shrugs&quot; offers a sharp and amusingaccount of French manners. &quot;In Praise of Frivolity&quot; is amouthwatering trip through all the good things (to eat andotherwise) to be found in France. And in passing, Mr.Bernstein dispels a few myths, among which the best known isthat the French are anti-American. In fact, as he accuratelypoints out, the French now are frantically pro-American andprove it constantly, imitation being the sincerest form ofworship.   Nor is the dark side of French politics ignored: There isa substantial chapter on the &quot;political class&quot; and thepopulation's relationship to it, a compound of respect,cynicism and outright derision. Add to that Mr. Bernstein'sexplanation of the role played by the few hundred graduatesof the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, and the frequentlack of responsiveness of the government to its own peoplebecomes clear; so does its tendency to continue its mistakeswell past the point of absurdity.   Darker subjects are tackled as well: the continuing roleof &quot;raison d'Etat&quot;, for instance, the &quot;reason of State&quot; whichenables the government to get away with a variety of scandalsin the name of national security: The sinking of the RainbowWarrior, the anti-nuclear Greenpeace ship bombed in Aucklandby the French secret services, is a perfect case in point.And, of course, Mr. Bernstein discusses the rise of racism assponsored by Jean-Marie Le Pen and his infamous NationalFront; but he is quick to point out that the anti-racistresponse has been massive and vigorous.   This is all very well, but there is more: Dispassionate,if fond, and enormously informative, &quot;Fragile Glory&quot; is morethan yet another book about France and the French. Althoughnothing like a guidebook, it offers a fascinating, thorough,and eminently useful explanation of the country and the wayit works; reading it will unquestionably make a trip toFrance richer and more enjoyable.   ---   Mr. Bernier is a biographer and lecturer specializing inFrench history.</TEXT></DOC>
