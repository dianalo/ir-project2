Some U.S. and European bankers and officials remain skeptical of Tokyo's willingness to become an effective voice on debt issues. And no one is predicting that Tokyo will supplant Washington as the leader in dealing with the debt crisis.    Nonetheless, Japanese officials have been highly visible at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank here, either proposing or backing several new initiatives for dealing with the debt crisis. &quot;These proposals demonstrate we are willing to present our views,&quot; said Toyoo Gyohten, vice minister of finance for international affairs.    Even though Japanese officials publicly deny it, one senior executive at a major Japanese bank said: &quot;The Ministry of Finance and Japanese bankers . . . are basically saying, 'The Baker Plan doesn't work, so where do we go from here?'&quot;    Two years ago in Seoul, South Korea, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker proposed that commercial banks and multilateral lending institutions step up lending to big debtor nations in return for the debtors opening their economies more to free-market principals.    &quot;It's a good plan; it just didn't work,&quot; said the banker. &quot;It's become painfully clear in 1987 that these debts aren't payable at 100 cents on the dollar. It's not a minority view; it's a majority view.&quot;    Japanese bankers said they are growing more reluctant to make new loans to Third World borrowers merely to allow the repayment of interest on existing debt.    At the conference here, Japanese officials have introduced or seconded approaches that include using the International Finance Corp., a unit of the World Bank, to facilitate the conversion of debt to equity, and have backed the principle of converting bank debt into securities. In addition, Japan suggested establishing a mechanism to guarantee bank loans against so-called non-commercial risks, such as political unrest, and has agreed to accelerate its disbursement of foreign aid.    &quot;There are some stirrings there; the question is how far they want to go with it,&quot; said a senior international monetary official.    Earlier this summer, Tokyo committed itself to using $30 billion to help recycle new funds to the Third World over the next three years. &quot;Clearly {that} was a move to stake out a role for Japan, even though a lot of it {the $30 billion} was fluff,&quot; said the monetary official.    That underlying skepticism about Japan's willingness to play a bigger role is widespread. A Japanese government official conceded that Tokyo is reluctant to publicly reveal overly dramatic approaches unless it is positive they will work. And bankers noted that there are disagreements on debt issues within the Finance Ministry and between Japan's banks.    Some analysts interpreted Tokyo's recent public posture as a defensive measure against demands from the U.S. and other nations that Japan ante up more funds for the Third World. Japanese bankers noted that Tokyo consistently has been prodded by its major trading partners to recycle more of its huge trade surplus to the Third World.    Others saw it as a logical progression for a nation that has the second-largest economy in the non-communist world and some of the world's biggest capital markets and has acquired enormous wealth. They also noted that Japan's banks have the second-biggest exposure to 15 major Third World debtors: about $35 billion to $40 billion, compared with about $90 billion for U.S. banks.    Several Japanese bankers contended that the current management of the debt crisis isn't working. Japanese banks are pushing for more cofinancing by the World Bank and other development banks and better accounting and tax treatment for reserves against bad debts. They also want either their government or the World Bank to guarantee any new loans to Third World debtors. In addition, some Japanese bankers and government officials have discussed moving the International Finance Corp. closer to actually acting as a negotiator for commercial banks with debtors.    Some of these concepts would give Tokyo's banks a competitive advantage in world markets, Japanese bankers conceded. They noted that Japanese banks' exposures to the Third World are smaller than American banks' and that Tokyo's banks have huge hidden reserves in the form of unrealized gains on securities holdings that could be liquidated to pay for write-offs.    The Japanese banks have been caught in a battle between the internationalists in the Finance Ministry and its tax bureau, which has resisted granting them relief. &quot;But the whole ministry is realizing it's now got to do something for the banks,&quot; said Kiyoshi Tsugawa, president of S.G. Warburg Securities (Japan) Inc.    The tax treatment of banks' reserves against bad loans will be discussed in December, as the government prepares its budget for the year beginning next April 1, said Tomomitsu Oba, a special adviser to the finance minister.    If they gained more generous tax benefits, Japanese banks would consider forgiving debtors' interest payments, said Nobuya Hagura, president of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. Yoh Kurosawa, deputy president of Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., already has suggested writing off some Third World debt.    But not all Japanese banks agree. Bank of Tokyo, for one, believed to have the largest exposure to the Third World, has resisted such approaches.    In the meantime, &quot;Japanese commercial banks are very reluctant to provide new money now,&quot; said Mr. Oba. He said the banks are disturbed by Brazil's current moratorium on much of its bank debt and noted that banks already have had to reschedule new loans made to Mexico and Argentina since 1982.    Moreover, &quot;American banks in reality are lessening their exposure to lesser developed countries while Japanese banks have increased their outstanding {assets},&quot; complained a Japanese government official. &quot;I'm really concerned about {Japanese banks'} creditworthiness if they keep increasing their exposure.&quot;    A recent analysis by Mitsui Bank shows that as of September 1986, Japan's banks held 12% of bank loans extended to 15 major debtors, up from 10.1% in December 1984. During the same period, U.S. bank exposure declined to 30.7% from 33.8%.    ---              Commercial Bank's Debt Exposure    Exposure of Japanese and U.S. banks to six big debtornations, as of September 1986, in billions of dollars  Country               Japanese                U.S.  Brazil                  $8.9                 $25.3  Mexico                  10.8                  23.9  Argentina                5.0                   9.5  Venezuela                2.3                   8.6  Philippines              2.1                   5.4  Chile                    1.6                   7.1   Source: Mitsui Bank</TEXT></DOC>
