 Of course, many of these companies arerelatively small, which makes it easier to deliver high growth.andP;  Examplesinclude Synoptics Communications Inc., Cabletron Systems Inc., Banyan SystemsInc., Autodesk Inc. and BMC Software Inc.andM;But other software and networking companies are getting to be quite large andstill are growing lustily -- for example, Oracle Corp., Microsoft Corp. andNovell Inc.andM;The much-discussed down-sizing phenomenon is impacting the software companiesthat primarily serve the slow-growth, maturing mainframe and minicomputermarkets.andP;  Thus, Computer Associates International Inc., seemingly havingrecovered from its ill-advised and poorly executed acquisition of CullinetSoftware Inc., nevertheless has reported slower sales than had been expected.andO;Legent Corp. and Systems Center Inc. are feeling the pinch, too.andM;The services firms with a major stake in commercial systems integration,facilities management or out-sourcing, such as Electronic Data Systems Corp.,andO;are doing well.andM;But those focusing on the budget-starved federal sector continue to be underpressure.andP;  Examples here include Computer Sciences Corp., C3 Inc. andLockheed's Integrated Solutions Co.andM;Product Mix ShiftandM;Most multibillion-dollar, broad-based systems vendors, both here and inEurope, are working their way through a major and rather painful product mixshift that has slowed their sales growth and that, despite significant costcutting or so-called restructuring, is hurting their bottom lines.andP;  IBM Corp.andO;and its compatible coattail rider, Amdahl Corp. are two exceptions that arecoping reasonably well.andM;The product mix shift has to do with:andM;* The inexorable user migration from higher-margined proprietary mainframearchitectures to lower-margined, microprocessor-based standard platforms.andO;This technology-enabled shift takes advantage of prices an order of magnitudeless than those charged for today's mainframes or minicomputers.andP;  Users getsimilar relative performance.andM;* Users' proclivity to turn to systems integrators or out-source theirsystems operations altogether, as application development and MIS operationsbecome ever more complex and costly.andP;  When this happens, the systems vendorslose their &quot;lock-in&quot; advantage, and they no longer can count on customerloyalty.andM;What about the geographic mix of business?andP;  Contrary to what has been thecase for the last two years, when overseas business was robust, Europeandemand has begun to soften.andP;  U.S.andP;  systems/hardware orders remainuninspiring, except for a few segments such as PCs.andM;With European demand continuing to weaken and the U.S.andP;  economy showinganemic growth, the industry's second-half prospects are unpromising, to saythe least, although as always a few companies will shine.andP;  But given what ishappening in Washington, these exceptions won't be among the companiesfocusing significantly on the federal marketplace.andM;Is the U.S.andP;  demand picture about to turn?andP;  A couple of negative trends argueagainst a near-term positive diagnosis.andM;First, the aerospace and defense sector is retrenching on all fronts, whichalready is cutting into its plans for buying information systems.andP;  Worse isstill to come as defense firms combine facilities or go out of business viamergers.andM;Second, the Defense Department has launched its much-touted CorporateInformation Management plan, which will result in consolidation of ADPcenters across the uniformed services and, hence, reduced IS spending.andP;  Not apretty picture.andM;And the federal budget compromise now being negotiated probably will resultin further slashing of government IS budgets regardless of the merits of theplans filed with the Office of Management and Budget.andP;  Normally the federalgovernment accounts for about 15 percent of all U.S.andP;  IS spending.andP;  Thus thelikely significant slow-down will add to the vendors' woes.andM;In recognition of some of these trends, IBM late last spring consolidated itsfederal national marketing division with its federal systems integrationactivities, forming the federal business sector.andP;  And layoffs and relatedbelt-tightening are spreading through the federally focused IS firms like abrushfire.andM;Demand from the U.S.andP;  private sector also is not what it should be.andP;  Thus,despite restructuring, many of the U.S.andP;  and European large systems companieswill have to tighten their belts another notch or two.andM;IBM is about to introduce Summit, its next generation of mainframes, in orderto draw even with Amdahl Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and Hitachi Data Systems Corp.andO;For IBM this will begin a product transition from the currently marketed3090J.andP;  Such transitions in the past always have taken their toll on IBM'searnings as customers delay acquisition decisions.andM;Digital Equipment Corp. has begun to ship its top-of-the-line VAX 9000, theone DEC calls a mainframe, and has announced its VAX 4000 line ofminicomputers offering about twice the performance of IBM's AS/400 at aboutone-half the price.andP;  Digital's second-half performance -- the first half ofits fiscal 1991 -- should be better than last year's.andM;Control Data Corp. is hanging in, but barely, as is loss-plagued Bull HNInformation Systems Inc., following its misguided acquisition of Zenith DataSystems.andP;  These old-line companies have not succeeded in differentiatingtheir products and have little to offer that is not available from someoneelse either less expensive or at least IBM-compatible, which the users regardas safer.andM;On the other hand, the second-half prospects for the leading PC and technicalworkstation suppliers, notably Apple Computer Inc., Compaq Computer Corp.,andO;Tandy Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc., are quite bright, as are those of thedata communication, PC and workstation-focused software and privatesector-oriented services firms.andM;The conclusion has to be that the computer industry is facing rough sleddingduring the next six to 12 months, but it is not a monolith washed with thesame tides at all times.andP;  Rather, the fundamentals shaping the destiny of itsmajor segments must be assessed separately.andM;Ulric Weil is president of Weil andamp; Associates, a Washington consulting firm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
