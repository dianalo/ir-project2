The bill was passed 252 to 174, just 10 months after intensepublic criticism forced the House to reject a larger pay increase.   The new proposal sped through the House with strong support fromthe leaders of both parties and an endorsement from President Bush.A slight majority of Republicans voting opposed the bill despiteBush's stance.   The Senate planned to consider the plan Friday, includingwhether to take the same salary increases the House approved foritsef, government executives and federal judges. With Congresshoping to adjourn next week, Senate leaders scheduled an unusualbipartisan caucus for Friday morning to iron things out.   ``I can understand and sympathize with people in my district whomake 15 and 20 and $30,000 a year who would have troubleunderstanding why this kind of pay level is needed,'' said HouseMajority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.   ``But,'' he told his colleagues, ``in your heart and in yourmind you know it's the right thing to do.''   Rep. James A. Traficant, D-Ohio, took a different view.   ``I understand the game _ we come with ethics reform and wesneak in a pay raise,'' he said.   The complex 100-page pay and ethics package was announced byDemocratic and Republican leaders Wednesday, but copies were notmade available to the public until debate was well under wayThursday.   Public criticism, some of it galvanized by broadcast talk-showhosts, helped lead to defeat of a proposed 51 percent congressionalpay raise earlier this year. But there was no time this time.   ``Without public hearings, without a decent interval of time forthe American people to digest it, ... the House leadershiprailroaded it through,'' complained consumer advocate Ralph Nader,who opposes congressional pay increases.   But Ann McBride, senior vice president of Common Cause, theself-proclaimed public interest organization, hailed the action as``moving toward a time when we will have government fullycompensated by the public, and not by special interest influencemoney.''   The bill would increase salaries in the House, for federaljudges, and for top executive branch officials by at least 35percent and often by closer to 40 percent.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said the Senatewould consider the bill Friday. However, it was not clear whatraises or honoraria limits the Senate might include for itself.   The Senate could give itself a smaller raise, as it did earlierthis decade. Senators were paid less than House members for aboutsix months seven years ago before senators approved a catch-upraise.   The House bill provides for a 7.9 percent cost-of-living hike byJanuary. On Jan. 1, 1991, a 25 percent raise would be given _ ontop of whatever cost-of-living increase is given to rank-and-filecivil servants at that time.   Assuming a 3 percent 1991 civil service raise, House members whonow make $89,500 likely would see their pay increase to about$125,000.   However, lawmakers who currently add to their incomes withhonoraria for speeches would have to give that up. Current rulesallow House members to pocket honoraria totaling up to 30 percentof their salaries, while senators can keep 40 percent.   Gephardt cited the honoraria rules as a key reform which wouldraise public confidence in Congress. He implored House members tohave courage to vote for the package.   ``We heard a hero yesterday talk to us about courage,'' he said,recalling Wednesday's congressional address by Polish labor leaderLech Walesa. ``Today is the day for us to be leaders, to havecourage to do what's right for this body, this institution, and forthis country and its people.''   Bush, who has been seeking for months to increase salaries forhis top aides and for federal judges, cleared the way for Houseaction this week. By giving his blessing to the package, he made itmore difficult for Democrats or Republicans to use pay as apartisan issue.   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., co-chairman of the task force thatdrafted the package, announced Thursday that the heads of the twopolitical parties were signing a statement that ``they have nointention of having it become part of'' the 1990 election dialogue.   The ethics reforms in the bill stem in part from the case offormer Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who resigned from the House inJune after the House ethics committee charged him with evadinglimits on honoraria income and with accepting improper gifts.   Foley vowed when he took over the speakership that he would pushan ethics bill to the floor this year, and said it probably wouldhave to include a pay raise to get members' support.   The legislation would bar House members from accepting fees forspeeches, but they could suggest their hosts pass on up to $2,000in the member's name to a charity of the member's choice. The billrequires members to reveal the donor but not the destination of themoney.   Income earned outside the House would be limited to 15 percentof salary beginning in 1991. Members could not receive directors'fees, legal fees or other income for professional services. Bookroyalties would remain exempt from the limits but with newrestrictions.   The bill also would tighten rules on accepting gifts and ontravel that members may accept.   ``It says boys and girls, this is a full-time job. Pay attentionto what's going on here. We'll compensate you straight from thepublic treasury, right out in the open, but no more side employmentdeals,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.</TEXT></DOC>
