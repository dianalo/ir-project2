(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Researchers have cut short anexperiment aimed at learning if the endangered Florida panther canever again survive outside the Everglades.   The experiment in north Florida was halted after the deaths offour of seven Texas cougars used as surrogates for their Floridacousins. The remaining two in the wild were captured this week nearOsceola National Forest, according to Tom Logan, chief of theWildlife Research Bureau at the Florida Game and Fresh Water FishCommission. The seventh was caught last week.   ``The two animals would not have given us any new information.We don't feel it's prudent or productive to leave the animals outin the field,'' Logan said Wednesday.   The Texas cougar, a subspecies related to the Florida panther,was being studied to see how it adapted to north Florida. Both bigcats are closely related to the mountain lion or puma.   The Florida panther once roamed north Florida's woods but is nowconfined to the Everglades of south Florida where officialsestimate no more than 50 survive. The last confirmed north Floridasighting of one was the early 1960s.   Of the seven Texas cats in the experiment, one died of unknowncauses, two were shot by poachers and a fourth had to be killedafter it was injured while being captured by wildlife officers.   In addition to the two caught this week, one was removed fromthe wild last week after it took to hunting exotic deer at aprivate hunting preseve.   Wildlife officials had planned to end the program in June, ayear after the release of the first five Texas cougars.   ``When we had the original group, they behaved as they should.When the numbers were reduced, things started happening,'' Logansaid. ``We need to evaluate the number of animals out there and howit affects them.''   Until information from the experiment is evaluated, Logan saidhe could not recommend whether Florida panthers should be releasedin north Florida.</TEXT></DOC>
