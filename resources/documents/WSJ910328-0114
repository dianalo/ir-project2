The company said it doesn't expect to take a charge tofirst-quarter earnings tied to the cost of rebuilding andrestarting damaged units at the plant. A company spokesmansaid that the difference between proceeds from a damageinsurance policy on the plant, and the book value of theplant, covers the $5 million deductible feature of thepolicy. Union Carbide doesn't carry business interruptioninsurance.</LP><TEXT>   The full-year cost in terms of lost income for theDanbury, Conn., chemical company will total $50 million to$75 million, or about 39 cents to 59 cents a share, UnionCarbide said. The company has about 126 million sharesoutstanding.   In last year's first quarter, Union Carbide reported netincome of $94 million, or 66 cents a share. Full-year netincome totaled $308 million, or $2.19 a share.   Robert D. Kennedy, Union Carbide chairman and chiefexecutive officer, said in a statement that ethylene andpolyethylene production at the plant will be &quot;substantiallyphased in&quot; by the end of April, subject to certain governmentapprovals. But ethylene oxide and derivative production isn'texpected to resume until the third quarter, he said.   The explosion and fire apparently started in equipmentused to produce ethylene oxide, which is used in themanufacture of antifreeze, polyester fibers and surfacecleaning fluids, or surfactants. The company said that onecontract worker at the plant died as the result of theexplosion and a total of 20 workers were treated for injuriesin area hospitals. Union Carbide said it didn't believe anyhazardous materials were emitted as a result of theexplosion.   Mr. Kennedy declined to comment on the cause of theexplosion and fire until the company investigation isconcluded. He said the company would release a report on theexplosion at that time.   The company said it is continuing to supply most grades ofpolyethylene, ethylene glycol and surfactants to customersfrom inventory, other plants and purchased material. UnionCarbide said its ability to supply &quot;certain other ethyleneoxide derivatives, including ethanolamines and some glycolethers will be substantially affected&quot; until the Seadriftplant is operating.</TEXT></DOC>
