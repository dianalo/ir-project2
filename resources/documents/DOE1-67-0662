<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-67-0662 </DOCNO><TEXT>An extensive survey on the current scientific position on the self-heatingof solid fuels is given in which literature from East European as wellas from West European countries is considered. The different theorieson the chemical processes involved in the oxidation of carbon are commentedon. The various processes in which self-heating can arise are dividedinto typical basic models. The influencing factors and material valueswhich are determined from the theoretical and experimental models arediscussed. In spite of extensive investigations there are still no scientificallysupported, universally applicable criteria on the danger of self-heating.The various criteria applied are either of a purely empirical natureor are based on statistical evaluations of cases of loss. To conclude,suggestions are given for further research activities. 16 refs., 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
