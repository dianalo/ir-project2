The October sugar contract climbed 0.48 cent a pound, only0.02 cent less than its daily limit, to settle at 9.23 centsa pound. It rose on the belief that European acreage issmaller than last year and that crop yields will be lower.</LP><TEXT>   December cocoa, which has risen nearly $200 a ton sincethe third week in August, fell $2 a ton to end at $1,188. Therally had been driven by prospects for a crop that will fallas much as 100,000 tons short of demand. However, comments byGhana officials yesterday put those prospects into question.   Judith Ganes, a commodities analyst at Merrill Lynch inNew York, said these markets are now acting like &quot;weathermarkets&quot; but without the forecasts. &quot;Estimates are justsprung on you,&quot; she added.   Ms. Ganes observed that the first two tests on Europeansugar beets yields showed a decline. That fact, combined withreduced beet acreage, led to conclusions among traders thatCommon Market countries would produce less sugar this year.   But Ms. Ganes noted that these traders appear to beignoring the most recent sugar beet-yield tests, which haveindicated a &quot;dramatic recovery in sugar content.&quot; She saidthat in several European countries crop development hascaught up with last year.   &quot;If the weather continues to be favorable I would not besurprised to see sugar production revised upward,&quot; said Ms.Ganes.   Ms. Ganes noted that the Soviets are the world'ssecond-largest producers of sugar, as well as the largestimporter, but she expected Soviet production to be down thisyear as a result of the problems in that country. She alsopredicted the Soviets would have little money to importsugar.   However, Arthur Stevenson, commodities analyst forPrudential Securities in New York, attributed the buoyantsugar market to remarks made by a Soviet official to aCanadian delegation indicating that the country would have tobuy massive amounts of foodstuffs, including sugar, to avoidthe threat of starvation.   Ms. Ganes said that when the current rally in sugar showssigns of faltering, she wouldn't hesitate to sell contractsin expectation of prices dropping below eight cents a pound.   Though the cocoa market didn't rally as sugar did, itstraders also seemingly chose to ignore bearish news. Cocoaofficials in Ghana said their crop will be substantiallylarger than early estimates had indicated. They attributedthe larger crop to the planting of new hybrid varieties thatyield a lot more.   Many traders had been expecting a significantly smallercrop because of poor weather and the indifferent care thatgrowers had been giving the crop because of a long spell ofweak prices.   Expectations were for a world crop that could be as muchas 100,000 tons smaller than last year with most of thereduction coming from Brazil. Ms. Ganes said that withGhana's indication of a larger crop, and also the potentialof larger crops from Malaysia and Indonesia, the prospectsfor a production deficit have become very uncertain.   Mr. Stevenson noted, however, that the Ivory Coast, theworld's largest producer, remains the biggest question markin terms of output. Estimates of South American productionare in fairly close agreement.   Ms. Ganes said that if the current estimates of a deficityear prove wrong, she would expect much of the recent pricegains to be surrendered. &quot;I am also expecting some producerselling at these price levels,&quot; she added.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: The weekly industry report on U.S. petroleumsupplies, showing an increase, sent the market lower again.The American Petroleum Institute statistics were only part ofthe bearish news, however. Crude oil futures also continuedlower on reports that Saudi Arabia has been increasing stockssince July and that Iraq may be allowed to sell more crudeoil than originally expected. When everything had beenfactored in, trading took October crude 12 cents a barrellower to $21.69. Heating oil and gasoline futures pricesmoved lower as well, reflecting the API's report of inventoryincreases for those products.                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK andamp; MEATS: Prices of cattle futures contractsclimbed on speculation that increased purchases bymeatpackers are whittling down a glut of cattle in thenation's feedlots. Large sales of cattle in Kansas and Texasto feedlots earlier this week fanned the speculation, saidJerry Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons, St.Louis. Prices of hog and pork belly futures contracts rose.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Prices rallied on continued talk of a retentionscheme by major producers. The December contract ended 1.70cents higher at 90.20 cents a pound. The retention plan asproposed by Colombia and Brazil calls for producers towithhold 10% of their exportable production from the market.The plan appears to have found favor with four CentralAmerican producers, and yesterday Indonesia said it also wasinterested. Ms. Ganes of Merrill Lynch said that as long asthe prospects for the retention scheme remain positive themarket should hold steady. But she added, &quot;At the first signthat the scheme is not going to work, coffee prices will selloff.&quot; Mr. Stevenson of Prudential noted that theInternational Coffee Organization will meet in London Sept.23 to 27, when producers are expected to make a formalpresentation of their plan. &quot;Whether this plan will work ornot will depend upon the producers' ability to finance it,&quot;he noted.</TEXT></DOC>
