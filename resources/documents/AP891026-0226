Among the changes included in the alternative texts under studyis substituting ``God who creates, redeems and inspires'' for``Father, Son and Holy Spirit.''   The Supplemental Liturgical Texts, now being experimented within a few hundred parishes, also offer other alternatives toreferring to God and Jesus in masculine terms such as ``Lord'' andadd prayers that highlight the role of women in religion.   ``We are trying to answer the need of people throughout thecountry who feel left out, women in particular who feel the liturgyis male-oriented,'' said Bishop Vincent Pettit, chairman of thechurch's Standing Liturgical Commission.   But while some church leaders welcome the new texts as offeringa broader vision of God, others predict the radical changes inchurch services will unsettle many of the denomination's 2.5million members.   ``Are you going to provide flak vests with the book?'' BishopRobert Witcher of the Diocese of Long Island in New York asked thecommission when the texts were recently presented to the House ofBishops.   The church's General Convention of 1985 required the liturgicalcommission to develop inclusive language liturgies _ liturgies thatdo not refer to God in exclusively masculine terms.   In 1988, the General Convention voted that the supplementalservices be made available for testing in parishes no later thanthis Advent following a year of consultation between the liturgicalcommission and the House of Bishops' Theology Committee.   The Rev. Sarah Motley, coordinator of the liturgicalcommission's committee on inclusive language in the liturgy,estimates that 200 to 800 of the church's approximately 7,400parishes would experiment with the services in ``Prayer BookStudies 30-Supplemental Liturgical Texts.''   After the texts are evaluated in the parishes, the commissionwill propose supplemental liturgical texts to the 1991 DiocesanConvention.   The change Ms. Motley refers to as ``in many ways the mostdifficult frontier'' is the proposed alternative language for thetraditional terms for the three divine persons in one God that makeup the Christian Trinity _ the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.   For example, in The Book of Common Prayer, the ``Gloria Patri''recited in Morning Prayer is: ``Glory to the Father, and to theSon, and to the Holy Spirit: as it was in the beginning, is now,and will be forever.'' The alternative offered by the supplementaltexts is: ``Honor and Glory to the holy and undivided Trinity, Godwho creates, redeems and inspires: One in Three and Three in One,for ever and ever.''   Other options offered by the supplemental texts include severalinstances where phrases in the prayer book are altered to providegender-neutral terms for Jesus and God. In one part of the HolyEucharist, for example, the supplemental texts offer the prayer``Blessed is the one who comes in the name of our God'' as analternative to ``Blessed is he that cometh in the name of theLord.''   The supplemental texts are ``long overdue,'' said MarjorieChristie, head of the Episcopal Women's Caucus. ``The ability toobliterate the totally masculine words from our worship time is away we are able to broaden our vision of God,'' she said.   Pettit said it is helpful for churchgoers to pray to a personalGod, but they have to be careful not to take masculine termsliterally.   ``God is not male or female,'' he said.   While the supplemental texts do not advocate deleting allmasculine references to God, they also offer feminine imagery notin the current prayer book.   Instead of ending the evening worship service asking for theblessing of the ``Lord,'' the supplemental texts offer thefollowing alternative: ``May the blessing of the God of Abraham andSarah, and of Jesus Christ born of our sister Mary, and of the HolySpirit, who broods over the world as a mother over her children, beupon you and remain with you always.''   The texts already have drawn criticism.   ``I think the result is going to be catastrophic,'' said theRev. Jerome Politzer, president of the Prayer Book Society inAmerica, a group of conservative Episcopalians who are opposed tothe 1979 revisions to the 1928 Book of Common Prayer.   Politzer said there is nothing ``universal, aesthetic orreligious'' about the changes in the supplemental texts and chargedthey amount to a new prayer book.   ``This is heresy, and should be rejected,'' Politzer said.   Pettit said even if the 1991 General Convention approved thesupplemental texts for use in parishes as an option in addition tothe prayer book, they would not be allowed to be published withinthe Book of Common Prayer.   ``We're looking 20 years down the road to prayer bookrevision,'' he said.   But advocates for inclusive language hope one day the prayerbook will be revised to reflect their concerns.   ``Yes, it will be uncomfortable, because explorations areuncomfortable, but it may bring us closer to the God who callsus,'' said Ms. Motley. ``It's the old question: Do people go tochurch to be comforted, or to be challenged?''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Friday</NOTE><TEXT>   AMs, Oct. 27</TEXT></DOC>
