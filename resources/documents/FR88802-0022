This action will not have an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more, nor will it result in majorincreases in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State or local government agencies, or geographic regions. Furthermore,it will not have significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United State-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612). The Administrator of the Food and NutritionService has certified that this rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.Although this rule reflects a number of changes to Part 210, the reportingand recordkeeping requirements remain unchanged. These requirements havebeen approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use throughJune 30, 1990 (OMB No. 0584-0006).The National School Lunch Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal DomesticAssistance under No. 10.555 and is subject to the provisions of ExecutiveOrder 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State andlocal officials. (7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V and 48 FR 29112, June 24,1983.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The last major revision of 7 CFR Part 210, the regulations governing theNational School Lunch and Commodity School Programs, was published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> on January 20, 1970 (35 FR 753). Since thattime, Part 210 was amended by over 70 final and interim rules, many ofwhich were promulgated quickly in response to legislation or litigation.As a result, Part 210 contained ambiguities and inconsistencies as wellas duplicative and obsolete provisions. On February 12, 1985, the Department published a proposed revision of Part210 in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> (50 FR 5950). The proposal was intended to clearup ambiguities and inconsistencies, remove unnecessary, duplicative andobsolete provisions; examine the organization of Part 210 and its components;rewrite as necessary to ensure that Part 210 is easily understood; and,based on the resultant revisions, redesignate paragraphs and sections toaccommodate the changes. Several policy changes were also proposed. TheDepartment provided a 60-day comment period, during which time 927 commentswere received. The Department determined that, in recognition of the large number of commentsreceived and the extensive changes made, a second round of public commentswould be beneficial. Thus, on September 30, 1986, the Department publishedan interim rule in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 34864). This interim rule provided commenterswith a 120-day comment period. During this comment period, 154 commentswere received from a variety of sources, including State educational agencies,school personnel, industry, and the general public. The Department wouldlike to thank all those commenters who responded to both the proposed andinterm rules. Especially appreciated were those many detailed suggestionswhich proved helpful in formulating this final rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Comments </ITAG>Of the 154 comments received on the interim rule, 82 addressed a singleissue, i.e., the duration of contracts between school food authoritiesand food service management companies. Only 75 commenters addressed otheraspects of Part 210 (three of whom also addressed the duration issue).Of the 75 commenters addressing other issues, the major areas of concernincluded the elimination of Federal reimbursement for second lunches, thenewly defined ``subsidized lunch'', and the subsitution of food items forhandicapped children. Since commenters did not express any opposition to the reorganization ofPart 210, the Department has adopted the new format. A redesignation tablewas provided in the interim rule which indicated the old section numbersand the corresponding new section numbers. Since this final rule has adoptedthe same format provided in the interim rule, the redesignation table wasnot restated in this rule. Interested parties may obtain a copy of theredesignation table from the Deaprtment upon request. The remainder of this preamble discusses concerns expressed by commentersand the specific changes being made in the final rule. For ease in reference,commenter concerns and any corresponding changes are explained under thefinal rule section headings. The preamble does not address sections forwhich no substantive objections were raised by commenters or those commentswhich resulted in nonsubstantive revisions which simply serve to clarifythe regulatory wording. Commenters will note that the Appendices remainunchanged, except for minor corrections, and are not restated in this finalrule. Subsequent amendments will be numbered consecutively, beginning withnumber 1. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart A_General </ITAG>Section 210.2 Definitions. Several commenters requested clarification of the definition ``<T3>Commodity School Program</T3>'' and an explanation of how it relatesto Commodity Only Schools. To clarify the definition, several changes weremade to the final rule. ``Commodity School Program'' is defined to meana program under which participating schools operate a nonprofit lunch programin accordance with the provisions of Part 210 and receive donated foodassistance in lieu of general cash assistance. Participating schools alsoreceive special cash assistance, the entitlement value of donated foodassistance and bonus donated foods. Prior to August 1981, the National School Lunch Act authorized the participationof schools which received only commodity assistance. Such schools weretermed ``Commodity Only Schools''. In 1981, Pub. L. 97-35 amended the Actto allow these schools to receive special cash assistance, thus changingtheir commodity only status. To acknowledge this change in status, theinterim rule termed these schools as the Commodity School Program. Whileusage of this term suggests a totally separate program, it does providea technical advantage. The Department defined ``Program'' to mean boththe National School Lunch Program and Commodity School Program, thus throughoutPart 210, references to Program refer to both types of operations.Several commenters expressed concerns regarding the definition ``<T3>Food item</T3>''. The interim rule defined food item to mean one ofthe five required food servings that compose the reimbursable school lunch.Commenters were concerned that the word ``servings'' suggested that eachfood item would need to be a distinct item, thus disallowing a food thatcombined food items, such as pizza. To clarify the definition, the finalrule defines a food item as one of the five required foods that composethe reimbursable school lunch. The definition, ``<T3>High tuition private school</T3>'', has been deleted. This definitionwas added in response to the Child Nutrition Amendments of 1986 which increasedthe tuition limit on private schools from $,1500 to $2,000. Subsequently,Pub. L. 100-71, enacted July 11, 1987, removed all tuition limitations,thereby making this definition obsolete. The interim rule defined ``<T3>Lunch</T3>'' to mean a meal which meets the school lunch pattern forspecified age/grade groups of children as designated in section 210.10and, unless otherwise exempted by FNS, which is served at or about midday.Several commenters requested clarification of ``unless otherwise exemptedby FNS''. For purposes of clarity, that portion of the definition regardingtimeframes has been moved to andSection; 210.10(g),<T3> Lunch period</T3>. This final rule presents a slightly abbreviated definition of ``<T3>School</T3>''. The Department is hopeful that this definition willprovide the clarity requested by commenters. To ensure that no misinterpretationoccurs, the Department would like to restate its intent regarding preprimaryclasses. Preprimary classes are eligible to participate: (a) When theyare recognized as part of the educational system of the State; or (b) whenthey are conducted in a participating school having classes of primaryor higher grades. ``<T3>School food authority</T3>'' has been revised to clarify that a schoolfood authority means the governing body which is responsible for the administrationof one or more schools. Such governing body ``* * * shall have the legalauthority to operate the Program therein or be otherwise approved by FNSto operate the Program.'' This definition is designed to provide FNS withthe authority to approve arrangements between schools which are administeredby different legal entities. For example, FNS may authorize a public schooldistrict to act as a school food authority for schools within the publicschool district and, provided that a contractual arrangement exists, forany nearby eligible private schools. The school food authority would berequired to ensure all program requirements are met for any school forwhich it acts as governing body. Almost 40 commenters disapproved of the definition of ``<T3>Subsidized lunch</T3>'' and suggested a return to the term ``paid lunch''.However, each ``paid lunch'' bought by students is subsidized by the Departmentwith both cash assistance and donated food assistance. Therefore, the finalrule restates the definition without change. The definition ``<T3>Tuition</T3>'' has been deleted. Pub. L. 100-71, enacted on July 11,1987, removed all tuition limitations previously imposed upon private schools,thereby making this definition obsolete. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart B_Assistance to States and School Food Authorities </ITAG>Section 210.8 Method of reimbursement. One commenter expressed some concern regarding the intent of paragraph(b),<T3> Content of claim</T3>, which states that the State agency ``may authorizea school food authority to submit a consolidated Claim for Reimbursement* * *''. The commenter suggested that this wording allowed a school foodauthority to make the determination of whether or not to submit a consolidatedclaim. This is not the Department's intent; clearly, the determinationrests with the State agency. The final rule restates this provision withoutchange. Paragraph (c),<T3> Advance funds</T3>, of both the interim and final regulations establishesprocedures whereby State agencies may make advance funds available forthe Program to a school food authority in an amount equal to the amountof reimbursement estimated to be needed for one month's operation. Severalcommenters noted that the regulatory language conflicts with the Department'spolicy on making advance funds available. The Department would like to point out that while the authority currentlyexists to make advance funding available, all funding is contingent uponthe extent to which funds are available. Currently, the Department is unableto make such advance funding available. However, the States continue tohave the authority to make advances available to schools. While the Departmentwill not provide the funds to do so, States may rely on available Statefunds or on their existing authority to vary rates of reimbursement. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart C_Requirements for School Food Authority Participation </ITAG>Section 210.9 Agreement With State Agency. Paragraph (b), <T3>Annual agreement</T3>, of the interim rule required each school foodauthority to maintain a current written agreement on file at the Stateagency each year. State agencies were authorized to allow school food authoritiesto extend by amendment a previous year's agreement in lieu of taking anew agreement annually, provided that a current written agreement is onfile each year. Fifteen commenters recommended revising the interim provisionto allow agreements to stay on file until substantial changes necessitatethe development of a new agreement.The Department cannot accept the commenters' suggestion. The Program isa grant program with funds appropriated on a fiscal year basis. The Departmentdoes not believe a longstanding agreement would be supported by the NationalSchool Lunch Act nor would it be in the best interest of the Program. Maintenanceof a current agreement is a good management practice which enables Stateagencies and FNS to be fully apprised of the responsible parties and theirduties. This requirement also serves to assure the Department that anynew school officials will be cognizant of their responsibilities underthe Program. Therefore, the final rule restates the interim wording.Section 210.10 Lunch components and quantities.Several commenters to the proposed rule recommended deletion of productionrecords, contending that the prohibition on claiming reimbursement forsecond lunches obviates the need for production records. The Departmentretained the requirement for production records in paragraph (b), <T3>General, </T3>of the interim rule; however, commenters were encouragedto address the usefulness of retaining production records.Of the 12 commenters who addressed this issue, 8 opposed the retentionof production records arguing that offer versus serve and the prohibitionon claiming for second lunches make production records obsolete. Commentersin favor of retaining these records indicated that this requirement leadsto good management practices. This complements the Department's contentionthat schools can use the historical perspective provided by productionrecords to assist in forecasting the number of lunches and quantities ofeach food item needed to provide one lunch per child per day. Since sofew commenters expressed concern regarding this issue, the Department doesnot believe that sufficient cause exists to remove this requirement. Thus,the final rule remains unchanged.Approximately 60 commenters addressed the requirement in paragraph (b),for the elimination of reimbursement for excess lunches. Most of thesecommenters (95%) opposed the elimination of reimbursement for excess lunchesciting the difficulties in monitoring and in predicting the actual numberof lunches needed and the burden placed on satellite programs.The Department recognizes the validity of commenter concerns and the consequentburden of such a requirement. However, fiscal constraints mandate thatno Federal reimbursement be claimed for lunches served in excess of onereimbursable lunch per child per day. In support of the Department's position,several commenters identified the costs of allowing excess lunches to beclaimed. Extrapolation of those costs nationwide suggests that an excessiveamount of program funds are being expended to provide children more thanone lunch per child per day. The Department remains firm in its positionto prohibit reimbursement for lunches served in excess of one reimbursablelunch per child per day. Therefore, the final rule remains unchanged fromthe interim.Several commenters questioned whether the ``one lunch per child per day''provision applied to enrolled or participating children. To ensure no confusionexists, the Department would like to clarify that this provision appliesto participating children and in no way may it be construed to apply toenrolled children.One commenter pointed out an inconsistency between the meal pattern chartand the regulatory language in paragraph (d)(2)(ii). The interim rule statedthat nuts and seeds served as a meat alternate meet 50 percent of the meat/meatalternate requirement and must be combined with 50 percent of another meat/meatalternate. This language was revised in the final rule to state that nutsand seeds served as a meat alternate may be used to meet ``no more than''50 percent of the meat/meat alternate requirement and must be used in combinationwith any other meat/meat alternate.Readers will note that the meal pattern chart and paragraphs (d)(1), <T3>Milk, </T3>and (i)(5), <T3>Insufficient milk supply, </T3>have been revised to include a revisionof the milk requirement mandated by Public Laws 99-500 and 99-591 and subsequentlyimplemented by a final rule published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 23, 1987 (52 FR 9109). Specifically,the meal pattern chart and paragraphs (d)(1) and (i)(5) have been revisedto require schools to offer students fluid whole milk in addition to atleast one type of unflavored fluid milk containing two percent or lessmilk fats, such as lowfat milk, skim milk, or buttermilk.Readers should also note that paragraph (e), <T3>Offer versus serve, </T3>has been revised to make it clear that a schoolmust offer all five required food items; however, senior high school studentsmust be permitted to decline up to two of the five required food itemsand, at local discretion, students below the senior high school level maybe permitted to decline one or two of the required five food items. Whilethe decision to implement the offer versus serve provision for studentsbelow senior high rests with the local school food authority, the decisionregarding which food items to decline rests solely with the student.In response to commenters concerns, paragraph (g), <T3>Lunch period, </T3>has been clarified to specify that ``mid-day'' meansbetween 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., unless otherwise exempted by FNS. TheDepartment believes that with few exceptions schools can schedule luncheswithin these hours. To provide flexibility for unusual circumstances, suchas some split-shifts, the Department has provided for FNS exceptions tothese hours. However, the Department does not believe evening meals canbe considered lunch and does not intend to provide reimbursement for suchmeals.Paragraph (h), <T3>Infant lunch pattern, </T3>has been revised to incorporate the provisionsof a final rule which establishes consistency in the infant meal patternrequirements among the Child Nutrition Programs and reflects the most recentinformation regarding infant feeding practices. This rule was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 6, 1988 (53 FR 25303), and becomes effectiveon September 6, 1988.Interim paragraph (i)(1), <T3>Medical or dietary needs, </T3>requires substitutions in the meal patternto be made for those handicapped children whose handicap restricts theirdiet and allows, at local discretion, substitutions to be made for nonhandicappedchildren who are unable to consume the regular lunch because of medicalor other special dietary needs. In order to claim reimbursement for suchlunches, substitutions are to be made on a case by case basis and supportedby a statement of the need for substitutions signed, in the case of a handicappedchild, by a physician, and, in the case of a nonhandicapped child, by arecognized medical authority.Commenters requested clarification and guidance in implementing this provision.Special areas of concern included the definitions of handicapped and recognizedmedical authority, and the responsibility of the school food service toprovide special food items. While the Department has additional guidanceon the implementation of this provision, it would like to take this opportunityto clarify some of the areas of confusion.A handicapped student, as defined in 7 CFR Part 15b, is one who has ``** * a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or moremajor life activities * * *'' Major life activities are defined to includefunctions such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking,seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning and working. Lunches claimedfor reimbursement under this section must be supported by a statement froma physician, in the case of a handicapped child, and by a statement froma recognized medical authority, in the case of a nonhandicapped child.A recognized medical authority may include a physician, a registered nurse,or other health professionals specified by the State agency.Several commenters recommended that the required signature authority bethe same for handicapped as for nonhandicapped, but there was no consensuson whether the signature authority should be a physician or recognizedmedical authority. Since a school is required to make substitutions fora handicapped child, the physician is indeed the appropriate authority.However, in the case of a nonhandicapped child, the school is authorizedby not required to make substitutions, thus the signature of a physicianwas determined to be too stringent. For these reasons, the final rule remainsunchanged.Commenters also expressed concerns regarding whether a school food serviceis to provide foods not readily available to the kitchen. Nothing in thisregulation is meant to require schools to operate special diet kitchens.Usually there is no difficulty acquiring substitute items in local markets.However, if the authorized substitute foods are not normally kept in inventoryor are not generally available in local markets, the parents should providethe substitute food prescribed by the physician or recognized medical authority.Section 210.14 Resource management.Paragraph (a), <T3>Nonprofit school food service, </T3>has been revised to incorporatea provision of Public Laws 99-500 and 99-591 which authorizes schools touse facilities, equipment and personnel supported with nonprofit schoolfood revenues to support a nonprofit nutrition program for the elderly.A final rule implementing this provision was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 28, 1987 (52 FR 15297).Section 210.16 Food service management companies.Paragraph (a), <T3>General, </T3>has been revised to include the provisions of PublicLaws 99-500 and 99-591 which prohibit a school or school food authorityfrom contracting with a food service management company to operate an ala carte food service unless the company agrees to offer free, reducedprice and school food authority designated full price reimbursable mealsto all eligible children. Implementing regulations were published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 8, 1987 (52 FR 11186).Paragraph (d), <T3>Duration of contract, </T3>has also been revised to accommodate a changepublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 16, 1988 (53 FR 4377). That finalrule responded to comments originally received on the interim Part 210rewrite. Seventy-nine comments were received which recommended revisingthe existing requirement which limits a contract to one year with two yearlyrenewals, i.e., a 3-year bidding cycle. However, no change in the numberof possible contract renewals had been proposed. Hence, the Departmentissued a separate proposal rather than make any change without solicitingadditional comments. A proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 1, 1987 (52 FR 32930) which solicitedcomments on expanding the current requirement to allow a one year contractwith four yearly renewals. One hundred sixty-seven comment letters werereceived on the proposal. Of these comments, 151 expressed support forthe proposal. The supportive comments generally fell into three categories:reduction of administrative burden at all levels, impact on school foodservice staff, and impact on food service management company contract provisionsand operations. Therefore, the final rule published on February 16, 1988allows school food authorities to annually renew their one-year contractswith food service management companies four times for a maximum contractterm of five years. Only new contracts signed after February 16, 1988,are covered by this change. All previously existing contracts are subjectto the two-year renewal maximum that was in effect when those contractswere negotiated.Several commenters suggested additional revisions to the food service managementcompany portion of the regulations. Specifically, some commenters recommendedrevisions to a number of requirements in this section to reflect the diversearrangements between school food authorities and food service managementcompanies. A number of commenters recommended requiring all food servicemanagement companies to register with the State. The Department has takenthese comments under consideration and is reviewing the requirements ofthis section for possible revision in the future. No substantive changeshave been made in this final rule because the Department would first issuea proposed rulemaking in order to implement such changes. Readers will,however, note several minor technical changes to paragraphs (a)(6) and(c) of this section which are not intended to change current operatingprocedures.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart D_Requirements for State Agency Participation</ITAG>Section 210.17 Matching Federal funds.Paragraph (g), <T3>Reports, </T3>has been revised to extend the submission of the AnnualReport of Revenues (FNS-13) from 90 days to 120 days. This revision isintended to reflect actual operating policy.Section 210.18 Monitoring responsibilities.Paragraph (c), <T3>Improved management, </T3>of the interim rule restated the requirementthat the State agency shall work with a school food authority toward improvinga school food authority's management practices where the State agency hasfound poor food service management practices leading to decreasing or lowstudent participation and/or poor student acceptance of the Program orof foods served. Efforts to assist in the correction of management problemswere to include the promotion of student and parent involvement in Programactivities.Over 20 commenters opposed the requirement for parent/student involvement,arguing that the correction of management problems is very subjective,and that an additional requirement for parent/student involvement is difficultto administer and monitor. In response to commenter concerns, this paragraphhas been revised in the final rule to remove the requirement for parent/studentinvolvement. The Department has also revised its assessment of what constitutespoor student acceptance to allow for more flexibility.Readers will note a number of changes to andSection; 210.18 which implementthe provisions of a final rule which revised the AIMS reporting and recordkeepingrequirements. This final rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 26, 1987 (52 FR 5735). In additionto these changes, paragraph (m), <T3>AIMS recordkeeping, </T3>has been revised to require State agenciesto maintain AIMS records for 3 years after the end of the school year inwhich the review or audit was conducted. Previously, such records wereto be maintained for 3 years after the date of the exit conference. Thisrevision is intended to ensure that AIMS records are maintained for a complete4-year cycle and not, as previously authorized, for only a portion of thatcycle.Appendix A, B and CThe Appendices remain unchanged, except for minor corrections, and arenot restated in this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 210</ITAG>Food assistance programs, National School Lunch Program, Commodity SchoolProgram, Grant programs-Social programs, Nutrition, Children, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements, Surplus agricultural commodities.Accordingly, Subpart A, B, C, D, E, and F of Part 210 are revised as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 210_NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.1 General purpose and scope.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.2 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.3 Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart B_Assistance to States and School Food Authorities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.4 Cash and donated food assistance to States.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.5 Payment process to States.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.6 Use of Federal funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.7 Reimbursement for school food authorities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.8 Method of reimbursement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart C_Requirements for School Food Authority Participation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.9 Agreement with State agency.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.10 Lunch components and quantities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.11 Competitive food services.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.12 Student, parent and community involvement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.13 Facilities management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.14 Resource management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.15 Reporting and recordkeeping.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.16 Food service management companies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart D_Requirements for State Agency Participation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.17 Matching Federal funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.18 Monitoring responsibilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.19 Additional responsibilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.20 Reporting and recordkeeping.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart E_State Agency and School Food Authority Responsibilities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.21 Procurement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.22 Audits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.23 Other responsibilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart F_Additional Provisions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.24 Suspension, termination and grant closeout procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.25 Penalties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.26 Educational prohibitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.27 State Food Distribution Advisory Council.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.28 Regional office addresses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">210.29 OMB control numbers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendices</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">A_Alternate foods for meals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">B_Categories of foods of minimal nutritional value.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">C_Child Nutrition Labeling Program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>The provisions of Part 210 issued under sec. 2-12,60 Stat. 230, as amended; sec. 10, 80 Stat. 889, as amended; 84 Stat. 270;42 U.S.C. 1751-1760, 1779.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 210.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">General purpose and scope.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Purpose of the program. </T3>Section 2 of the National School LunchAct (42 U.S.C. 1751), states: ``It is declared to be the policy of Congress,as a measure of national security, to safeguard the health and well-beingof the Nation's children and to encourage the domestic consumption of nutritiousagricultural commodities and other food, by assisting the States, throughgrants-in-aid and other means, in providing an adequate supply of foodand other facilities for the establishment, maintenance, operation, andexpansion of nonprofit school lunch programs.''

Allmilk shall contain vitamins A and D at levels specified by the Food andDrug Administration and consistent with State and local standards for suchmilk. School food authorities that served \3/4\ cup (6 fluid ounces) ofmilk to Group III children prior to May 1, 1980, may continue to do so.Such school food authorities shall retain documentation of the date onwhich they began such service and the reasons for adopting this portionsize.(2) <T3>Meat or meat alternate. </T3>The quantity of meat or meat alternateshall be the quantity of the edible portion <T3>as served. </T3>When the school determines that the portion size ofa meat alternate is excessive, it shall reduce the portion size of thatparticular meat alternate and supplement it with another meat/meat alternateto meet the full requirement. To be counted as meeting the requirement,the meat or meat alternate shall be served in a main dish or in a maindish and only one other menu item. The Department recommends that if schoolsdo not offer children choices of meat or meat alternates each day, theyserve no one meat alternate or form of meat (e.g., ground, diced, pieces)more than three times in a single week.(i) Vegetable protein products, cheese alternate products, and enrichedmacaroni with fortified protein defined in Appendix A may be used to meetpart of the meat or meat alternate requirement when used as specified inAppendix A. An enriched macaroni product with fortified protein as definedin Appendix A may be used as part of a meat alternate or as a bread alternate,but not as both food components in the same meal.(ii) Nuts and seeds and their butters listed in program guidance are nutritionallycomparable to meat or other meat alternates based on available nutritionaldata. Acorns, chestnuts, and coconuts shall not be used as meat alternatesdue to their low protein and iron content. Nut and seed meals or floursshall not be used as a meat alternate except as defined in this part underAppendix A: Alternate Foods for Meals. As noted in the School Lunch Patterntable of this section, nuts or seeds may be used to meet no more than one-halfof the meat/meat alternate requirement. Therefore, nuts and seeds mustbe used in the meal with another meat/meat alternate to fulfill the requirement.(3) <T3>Vegetable or fruit. </T3>Full strength vegetable or fruit juice maybe counted to meet not more than one-half of the vegetable/fruit requirement.Cooked dry beans or peas may be used as a meat alternate or as a vegetable,but not as both food components in the same meal.(4) <T3>Bread or bread alternate. </T3>(i) All breads or bread alternates suchas bread, biscuits, muffins or rice, macaroni, noodles, other pastas orcereal grains such as bulgur or corn grits, shall be enriched or wholegrain or made with enriched or whole grain meal or flour.(ii) Unlike the other component requirements, the bread requirement isbased on minimum daily servings <T3>and </T3>total servings per week. Schools shall serve daily at leastone-half serving of bread or bread alternate to children in Group I <T3>and </T3>at least one serving to children in Groups II-V. Schools whichserve lunch at least 5 days a week shall serve a total of at least fiveservings of bread or bread alternate to children in Group I and eight servingsper week to children in Groups II-V. Schools serving lunch 6 or 7 daysper week should increase the weekly quantity by approximately 20 percent(\1/5\) for each additional day. When schools operate less than 5 daysper week, they may decrease the weekly quantity by approximately 20 percent(\1/5\) for each day less than five. The servings for biscuits, rolls,muffins, and other bread alternates are specified in the <T3>Food Buying Guide for Child Nutrition Programs (PA 1331), </T3>an FNSpublication.(e) <T3>Offer versus serve. </T3>Each school shall <T3>offer </T3>its students all five required food items as set forth inthe table presented under paragraph (c). Senior high students shall bepermitted to decline up to two of the five required food items. At thediscretion of the school food authority, students below the senior highlevel <T3>may </T3>be permitted to decline one or two of the required five fooditems. The price of a reimbursable lunch shall not be affected if a studentdeclines food items or accepts smaller portions. State educational agenciesshall define ``senior high.''(f) <T3>Choice. </T3>To provide variety and to encourage consumption and participation,schools should, whenever possible, provide a selection of foods and typesof milk from which children may make choices. When a school offers a selectionof more than one type of lunch or when it offers a variety of foods andmilk for choice within the required lunch pattern, the school shall offerall children the same selection regardless of whether the children areeligible for free or reduced price lunches or pay the school food authoritydesignated full price. The school may establish different unit prices foreach type of lunch served provided that the benefits made available tochildren eligible for free or reduced price lunches are not affected.(g) <T3>Lunch period. </T3>At or about mid-day schools shall serve luncheswhich meet the requirements of this part during a period designated asthe lunch period by the school food authority. Such lunch periods shalloccur between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., unless otherwise exempted by FNS.With State approval, schools that serve children 1-5 years old are encouragedto divide the service of the specified quantities and food items into twodistinct service periods. Such schools may divide the quantities and/orfood items between these service periods in any combination that they choose.(h) <T3>Infant lunch pattern. </T3>Infants under 1 year of age shall be servedan infant lunch as specified in this paragraph when they participate inthe Program. Foods within the infant lunch pattern shall be of textureand consistency appropriate for the particular age group being served,and shall be served to the infant during a span of time consistent withthe infant's eating habits. For infants 4 through 7 months of age, solidfoods are optional and should be introduced only when the infant is developmentallyready. Whenever possible the school should consult with the infant's parentin making the decision to introduce solid foods. Solid foods should beintroduced one at a time on a gradual basis with the intent of ensuringhealth and nutritional well-being. For infants 8 through 11 months of age,the total amount of food authorized in the meal patterns set forth belowmust be provided in order to qualify for reimbursement. Additional foodsmay be served to infants 4 months of age and older with the intent of improvingtheir overall nutrition. Breast milk, provided by the infant's mother maybe served in place of infant formula from birth through 11 months of age.However, meals containing only breast milk do not qualify for reimbursement.Meals containing breast milk served to infants 4 months of age or oldermay be claimed for reimbursement when the other required meal componentor components are supplied by the school. Although it is recommended thateither breast milk or iron-fortified infant formula be served for the entirefirst year, whole milk may be served beginning at 8 months of age as longas infants are consuming one-third of their calories as a balanced mixtureof cereal, fruits, vegetables, and other foods in order to ensure adequatesources of iron and vitamin C. The infant lunch pattern shall contain,as a minimum, each of the following components in the amounts indicatedfor the appropriate age group:(1) Birth through 3 months_4 to 6 fluid ounces of iron-fortified infantformula.(2) 4 through 7 months_(i) 4 to 8 fluid ounces of iron-fortified infantformula; (ii) 0 to 3 tablespoons of iron-fortified dry infant cereal (optional);and (iii) 0 to 3 tablespoons of fruit or vegetable of appropriate consistencyor a combination of both (optional).(3) 8 through 11 months_(i) 6 to 8 fluid ounces of iron-fortified infantformula or 6 to 8 fluid ounces of whole milk; (ii) 2 to 4 tablespoons ofiron-fortified dry infant cereal and/or 1 to 4 tablespoons meat, fish,poultry, egg yolk, or cooked dry beans or peas, or \1/2\ to 2 ounces (weight)of cheese or 1 to 4 ounces (weight or volume) of cottage cheese, cheesefood or cheese spread of appropriate consistency; and (iii) 1 to 4 tablespoonsof fruit or vegetable of appropriate consistency or a combination of both.(i) <T3>Exceptions.</T3> Lunches claimed for reimbursement shall meet the schoollunch pattern requirements specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of thissection. However, lunches served which accommodate the exceptions and variationsauthorized under this paragraph are also reimbursable. Exceptions and variationsare restricted to the following:(1) <T3>Medical or dietary needs.</T3> Schools shall make substitutions infoods listed in this section for students who are considered handicappedunder 7 CFR Part 15b and whose handicap restricts their diet. Schools mayalso make substitutions for nonhandicapped students who are unable to consumethe regular lunch because of medical or other special dietary needs. Substitutionsshall be made on a case by case basis only when supported by a statementof the need for substitutions that includes recommended alternate foods,unless otherwise exempted by FNS. Such statement shall, in the case ofa handicapped student, be signed by a physician or, in the case of a nonhandicappedstudent, by a recognized medical authority.(2) <T3>Ethnic, religious or economic variations.</T3> FNS may approve variationsin the food components of the lunch on an experimental or on a continuingbasis in any school where there is evidence that such variations are nutritionallysound and are necessary to meet ethnic, religious, or economic needs.(3) <T3>Foreign meal patterns.</T3> Schools in American Samoa, Puerto Ricoand the Virgin Islands may serve a starchy vegetable such as yams, plantains,or sweet potatoes to meet the bread or bread alternate requirement. Forthe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, FNS has established ameal pattern which is consistent with local food consumption patterns andwhich, given available food supplies and food service equipment and facilities,provides optimum nutrition consistent with sound dietary habits for participatingchildren. The State agency shall attach to and make a part of the writtenagreement required under andSection; 210.9, the requirements of that pattern.(4) <T3>Natural disaster.</T3> In the event of a natural disaster or othercatastrophe, FNS may temporarily allow schools to serve lunches for reimbursementthat do not meet requirements of this section.(5) <T3>Insufficient milk supply.</T3> The inability of a school to obtaina supply of milk shall not bar it from participation in the Program andis to be resolved as follows:(i) If emergency conditions temporarily prevent a school that normallyhas a supply of fluid milk from obtaining delivery of such milk, the Stateagency may approve the service of lunches during the emergency period withan available alternate form of milk or without milk.(ii) If a school is unable to obtain a supply of fluid whole milk and fluidunflavored milk containing two percent or less milk fats on a continuingbasis, the State agency may approve the service of either fluid whole milkor fluid unflavored milk containing two percent or less milk fats. TheDepartment recommends that the State agency approve for service the availablefluid milk with the lowest fat and sugar content. In Alaska, Hawaii, AmericanSamoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, andthe Virgin Islands, if a sufficient supply of fluid milk cannot be obtained,``milk'' shall include reconstituted or recombined milk, or as otherwiseprovided under written exception by FNS.(iii) If a school is unable to obtain a supply of any type of fluid milkon a continuing basis, the State agency may approve the service of luncheswithout milk if the school uses an equivalent amount of canned, whole ornonfat dry milk in the preparation of the lunch.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 210.11</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Competitive food services.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Definitions.</T3> For the purpose of this section:(1) ``Competitive foods'' means any foods sold in competition with theProgram to children in food service areas during the lunch periods.(2) ``Food of minimal nutritional value'' means: (i) In the case of artificiallysweetened foods, a food which provides less than five percent of the UnitedStates Recommended Dietary Allowances (USRDA) for each of eight specifiednutrients per serving; and (ii) in the case of all other foods, a foodwhich provides less than five percent of the USRDA for each of eight specifiednutrients per 100 calories and less than five percent of the USRDA foreach of eight specified nutrients per serving.

Poor student acceptancemay be indicated by a substantial number of students who routinely andover a period of time:(1) Do not favorably accept a particular menu item; (2) Return foods; or (3) Choose less than all five food items as authorized under andSection;210.10(e). (d) <T3>Food service management companies. </T3>Each State agency shall annuallyreview each contract between any school food authority and food servicemanagement company to ensure compliance with all the provisions and standardsset forth in andSection; 210.16. Each State agency shall perform an on-sitereview of each school food authority contracting with a food service managementcompany at least once during each 4-year period. Such reviews shall includean assessment of the school food authority's compliance with andSection;210.16. The State agency may require that all food service management companiesthat wish to contract for food service with any school food authority inthe State must register with the State agency. State agencies shall provideassistance upon request of a school food authority to assure compliancewith Program requirements. (e) <T3>Investigations. </T3>Each State agency shall promptly investigate complaintsreceived or irregularities noted in connection with the operation of theProgram, and shall take appropriate action to correct any irregularities.State agencies shall maintain on file evidence of such investigations andactions. FNS and OIG may make investigations at the request of the Stateagency or where FNS or OIG determines investigations are appropriate. (f) <T3>Assessment, Improvement and Monitoring System (AIMS). </T3>Each Stateagency shall perform AIMS reviews, audits or a combination thereof of allschool food authorities participating in the Program in accordance withthe provisions of this section; or a State agency may develop an alternatemonitoring system as specified in paragraph (n) of this section. (g) <T3>AIMS definitions. </T3>The following definitions are provided in orderto clarify AIMS requirements:(1) ``AIMS audits'' means on-site evaluations of school food authoritiesparticipating in the Program for compliance with AIMS performance standards,by State auditors or State contracted auditors once every 2 years, in accordancewith USDA's audit guide or an audit guide approved by FNS and USDA's OIG.(2) ``AIMS error tolerance level'' means the degree of error of an AIMSperformance standard as specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section which,if exceeded in a reviewed school food authority, triggers a second AIMSreview in all large school food authorities and in at least 25 percentof those small school food authorities which exceed error tolerance levelson a first AIMS review. (3) ``AIMS performance standards'' means the following standards whichmeasure compliance with Program regulations: (i) Performance Standard 1_Certification_Within the school food authority,each child's application for free and reduced price meals is correctlyapproved or denied in accordance with the applicable provisions of Part245. (ii) Performance Standard 2_Claims_The numbers of free and reduced pricemeals claimed for reimbursement by each school for any review period are,in each case, less than or equal to the number of children in that schoolcorrectly approved for free and reduced price meals, respectively for thereview period, times the days of operation for the review period. (iii) Performance Standard 3_Counting_The <T3>system </T3>used for counting and recording meal totals, by type, claimedfor reimbursement at both the school food authority and school levels yieldscorrect claims. (iv) Performance Standard 4_Components_Meals claimed for reimbursementwithin the school food authority contain food items as required by andSection;210.10. (4) ``AIMS reviews'' means on-site evaluation, of all school food authoritiesparticipating in the Program during each 4-year AIMS review period, bythe State agency or State auditors for compliance with the AIMS performancestandards and follow-up reviews, as required. (5) ``Corrective action plan'' means the written description a school foodauthority submits to the State agency to explain how and when a programdeficiency will be corrected. (6) ``Large school food authority'' means, in any State: (i) All school food authorities that participate in the Program and haveenrollments of 40,000 students or more each; and (ii) The two largest school food authorities that participate in the Programand have enrollments of 2,000 students or more each. (7) ``Small school food authority'' means, in any State, a school foodauthority that participates in the Program and is not a large school foodauthority. (h) <T3>Number of schools reviewed or audited under AIMS. </T3>The number ofschools within the school food authority which must be included in a reviewor audit is dependent upon the total number of schools in the school foodauthority. The minimum number of schools the State agency shall reviewor audit is illustrated in Table A:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table A</T4><H1>Number of schools in the school food authority</H1><H1>Minimum\1\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1 to 5 <D>1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6 to 10 <D>2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">11 to 20 <D>3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">21 to 40 <D>4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">41 to 60 <D>6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">61 to 80 <D>8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">81 to 100 <D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">101 or more <D>\2\12</D><F>\1\  Minimum number of schools to be reviewed or audited.</F><F>\2\ Twelve plus 5 percent of the number of schools over 100. Fractionsshall be rounded to the nearest whole number.</F></ITAG></ITAG>(i) <T3>AIMS reviews. </T3>States performing AIMS reviews shall monitor compliancewith the AIMS performance standards described in paragraph (g) of thissection. On the first AIMS review, the State agency shall review the schoolfood authority for Performance Standards 1-4. On second AIMS reviews, theState agency shall, at a minimum, review the school food authority forthe performance standards which exceeded error tolerances in the firstreview.(1) <T3>Scope of AIMS reviews. </T3>In reviewing performance standards: (i) The State agency shall analyze and determine the adequacy of localapproval procedures for free and reduced price meals by examining the eligibilitydeterminations made within the school food authority. The State agencyshall review the applications for all children for whom application wasmade attending the reviewed schools, or a statistically valid sample ofthe applications for such children. The State agency shall also ensurethat the system to update the application file is adequate. If the Stateagency chooses to review a statistically valid sample of applications,the State agency shall ensure that the sample size is large enough so thatthere is a 95 percent chance that the actual error rate for all applicationsis not less than 2 percentage points less than the error rate found inthe sample (i.e., the lower bound of the one-sided 95 percent confidenceinterval is no more than 2 percentage points less than the point estimate).In addition, the State agency shall determine the need for a second reviewand base fiscal action upon the error rate found in the sample. (ii) The State agency shall ensure that, at a minimum, for each schoolreviewed, the number of free meals claimed in the school food authority'smost recent Claim for Reimbursement does not exceed the number of childrencorrectly approved for free meals for the claim period times the days ofoperation of that school, as reported to the school food authority forthe claim month. The State agency shall apply the same procedure to theclaim for reduced price meals. (iii) The State agency shall ensure that each school reviewed has an adequatesystem for counting and recording meals served by reimbursement type andthat the school food authority properly consolidates meal counts from itsschools. (iv) The State agency shall determine by observation of a representativesample of meals that meals contain food items as required in andSection;210.10. (2) <T3>Timing of AIMS reviews. </T3>During each 4-year AIMS review period,the first AIMS review of a school food authority shall be completed withinthe school year in which the review was begun. A second AIMS review, whenrequired, is recommended to be conducted in the same school year as thefirst review and is required to be conducted no later than December 31of the school year following the first review.(3) <T3>Method of selecting school food authorities and schools to review.</T3>(i) Each school year, the State agency shall use its own criteria to selectschool food authorities for AIMS reviews; <T3>provided that </T3>all participating school food authorities are reviewedat least once every 4 years and that school food authorities found on thefirst review to exceed error tolerance levels are subject to second reviewsas specified in paragraph (i)(4) of this section.(ii) on A first AIMS review of a school food authority, the State agencyshall select, to the extend practicable, the required minimum number ofschools to review on a proportionate basis from each type of attendanceunit (e.g., elementary school, middle school, high school), and shall selectschools within attendance unit grouping either randomly or by using Stateagency criteria which shall be kept on file at the State agency. If usingits own criteria, the State agency shall ensure that some of the schoolsselected are chosen because of the likelihood of problems. On a secondAIMS review, the State agency shall choose schools using State agency criteria,which may include random selection. State agency criteria for selectingschools for second AIMS reviews shall also be kept on file. The minimumnumber of schools to be selected and reviewed during a first or secondAIMS review of a school food authority is specified in paragraph (h) ofthis section.(4) <T3>Error tolerance for AIMS review. </T3>State agencies shall ensure thatcorrective action plans are completed by all school food authorities whichare found on first reviews to exceed the error tolerance described below.Further, State agencies shall conduct second reviews of: all large schoolfood authorities found to exceed such tolerances on first reviews; andat least 25 percent of small school food authorities found to exceed suchtolerances on first reviews. An error tolerance is exceeded when: (i) For AIMS Performance Standard 1, 10 percent or more (but not less than10 children) of the children listed on reviewed applications and attendingreviewed schools in a school food authority are incorrectly approved ordenied for free or reduced price meal benefits; and/or (ii) For AIMS Performance Standard 2, a number of schools reviewed in aschool food authority, as specified in Table B of paragraph (i)(5), claimreimbursement for more free or more reduced price meals, respectively,than the number of children correctly approved for such meals for the testperiod times the days of operation for the period; and/or (iii) For AIMS Performance Standard 3, a number of schools reviewed ina school food authority, as specified in Table B of paragraph (i)(5), havean inadequate system for counting and recording meal totals by type claimedfor reimbursement, or the school food authority does not use valid proceduresfor consolidating claims; and/or (iv) For AIMS Performance Standard 4, 10 percent or more of the total mealsobserved in a school food authority are missing one or more required fooditems. (5) <T3>Performance standards 2 and 3 tolerances. </T3>Table B indicates thenumber of schools violating Performance Standards 2 or 3, thus necessitatinga corrective action plan in the applicable school food authority and asecond review in all large school authorities and at least 25 percent ofthe small school food authorities which exceed error tolerance levels ona first AIMS review.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>B <H1>Number of schools reviewed </H1><H1>Number of schools\1\</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">1 to 10 <D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">11 to 20 <D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">21 to 30 <D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">31 to 40 <D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">41 to 50 <D>5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">51 to 60 <D>6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">61 to 70 <D>71 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7 to 80 <D>8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">81 to 90 <D>9 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">91 to 100 <D>10 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">101 or more <D>\2\10</D><F>\1\Number of schools violating Performance Standards 2 or 3 respectively,thus necessitating a second review of the school food authority.</F><F>\2\10 plus the number identified above for the appropriate increment.</F></ITAG></ITAG> (6) <T3>Corrective action plans for AIMS reviews. </T3>Corrective action plansare required to address AIMS performance standard deficiencies exceedingthe error tolerance levels described in this section. The following proceduresshall be followed to develop a corrective action plan: (i) The State agency shall assist the school food authority in developinga mutually agreed upon corrective action plan. (ii) The corrective action plan shall identify the corrective actions andtimeframes needed to correct the deficiencies found during the review.Corrective action shall include all necessary fiscal actions as describedin andSection; 210.19(c), including adjusting data to be used in preparingthe Claim for Reimbursement. (iii) The plan shall be written, signed by the proper official of the schoolfood authority, and submitted to and approved by the State agency within60 days following the exit conference of a review. State agencies may extendthis deadline to 90 days. Extensions beyond 90 days may be made, for cause,with written justification to and approval by FNSRO. (iv) The State agency shall require the school food authority to implementan amended or extended corrective action plan when error tolerance levelsare exceeded on a second AIMS review. (7) <T3>New violations found on a second AIMS review. </T3>If, during the courseof a second AIMS review, a performance standard violation is found thathas not been noted on a previous AIMS review, the State agency shall instituteand document appropriate corrective action. If the violation exceeds theerror tolerance level, the State agency shall require a corrective actionplan and the completion of corrective action. The State agency shall takefiscal action as described in andSection; 210.19(c) of this part for anydegree of violation of AIMS Performance Standards 2, 3, and 4. (j) <T3>AIMS audits. </T3>Audits by State agency, State or State-contractedauditors may be used as an alternative to AIMS reviews. if the State agencychooses this option, the audit must ensure that the four performance standardslisted under paragraph (g) of this section are being complied with by theaudited school food authority. This includes performing all activitiesdescribed in paragraph (i)(1) of this section. Additionally, a State usingAIMS audits in place of AIMS reviews shall: (1) Audit school food authorities once every 2 years; (2) Take fiscal action in accordance with andSection; 210.19(c); (3) Have a documented system for achieving corrective action; (4) Select schools within a school food authority based upon generallyaccepted audit principles; and (5) Use a State audit guide approved by FNS. A State agency shall submitits guide to FNSRO by February 1 of each year; except that portions ofthe guide which do not change annually need not be resubmitted. State agenciesshall provide the title of the sections that remain unchanged, as wellas the year of the last guide in which the sections were submitted. (k) <T3>AIMS exit conference, notification and corrective action. </T3>TheState agency and the school food authority shall hold an exit conferenceat the close of an AIMS review or audit to discuss the deficiencies observed,the extent of the deficiencies and the corrective action needed to correctthe deficiencies. If a corrective action plan is required as describedin paragraph (i)(6) of this seciton, it shall be discussed during the exitconference. After every AIMS review or audit, the State shall provide writtennotification of the review or audit findings to the school food authority'ssuperintendent or authorized representative who signed the State agency/schoolfood authority agreement or who is otherwise authorized to represent thesuperintendent. The State shall require that the school food authoritytake and document corrective action for any program deficiency found onany review or audit. Corrective action may include training, assistance,recalculation of data to ensure the correctness of any claim that the schoolfood authority is preparing at the time of the review, or other actions.(l) <T3>AIMS reporting. </T3>Each State agency shall report to FNSRO: (1) The name of any school food authority which exceeds an error tolerancelevel on a second AIMS review in any review period and the type and extentof the regulatory violations; and (2) Beginning March 1, 1989, the results of AIMS reviews/audits by March1 of each school year, on a form designated by FNS. In such annual reports,the State agency shall include the results of all AIMS reviews/audits conductedin the preceding school year and any consequent second AIMS reviews performedin the preceding school year or by December 31 of the current school year.(m) <T3>AIMS recordkeeping. </T3>Each State agency shall keep records whichdocument the details of all AIMS reviews or audits and demonstrate thedegree of compliance with AIMS performance standards. AIMS records shallbe kept on file by the State agency for a minimum of 3 years after theend of the school year in which the review or audit was conducted or afterthe school year in which problems have been resolved, whichever is later.Such records shall include documentation of AIMS first reviews and anyconsequent second reviews. When necessary, the records must include a correctiveaction plan as described in this section. Additionally, the State agencymust have on file: (1) Criteria for selecting schools on first and second reviews, if theselection is not random; (2) Its system for selecting small school food authorities for second reviews;and(3) Documentation demonstrating compliance with the statistical samplingrequirements specified in andSection; 210.18(i). (n) <T3>State alternate to AIMS. </T3>Any State developed monitoring systemshall: (1) Be equivalent to AIMS in scope; (2) Monitor compliance with AIMS Performance Standards 1-4; (3) Include on-site visits of all school food authorities on a cyclicalbasis; (4) Require that corrective action be taken and documented for any Programdeficiency found; (5) Provide for fiscal action and set forth the State agency's criteriafor taking such action; (6) Provide for the maintenance of a detailed description of the systemand records of all monitoring visits and activities which demonstrate thedegree of compliance with AIMS performance standards, corrective actionneeded and taken, and fiscal action taken;(7) Receive approval by the appropriate FNSRO prior to implementation;and (8) Beginning March 1, 1989, submit annual reports of the results of suchalternate State monitoring reviews to FNSRO on a form designated by FNS.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 210.19</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Additional responsibilities.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General program management. </T3>Each State agency shall provide anadequate number of consultative, technical and managerial personnel toadminister programs and monitor performance in complying with all programrequirements. Such personnel shall, at a minimum, visit participating schoolsto monitor for compliance with Program regulations and instructions, theDepartment's nondiscrimination regulations (7 CFR Parts 15, 15a and 15b),and the Department's Uniform Federal Assistance Regulations (7 CFR Part3015). Each State agency shall establish a financial management systemunder which school food authorities shall account for all revenues andexpenditures of their nonprofit school food service. The system shall prescribethe allowability of nonprofit school food service expenditures in accordancewith this part, and, as applicable, 7 CFR Part 3015. The system shall permitdetermination of school food service net cash resources, and shall includeany criteria for approval of net cash resources in excess of 3 months'average expenditures.(b) <T3>Commodity distribution information.</T3> The State agency shall periodicallyassess school needs for donated foods under 7 CFR Part 250, notify thedistributing agency of the schools' commodity needs, and recommend appropriatevariations in rates of distribution. In assessing the commodity needs ofschools, usage history and existing donated food inventories should beconsidered. As early as practicable each school year, but later than September1, the State agency shall forward to the distributing agency and FNSROan estimate of the average daily number of Program lunches to be servedby school food authorities; an estimate of the average daily number oflunches to be served by commodity schools; and the amount of any cash paymentsin lieu of commodities for donated food processing and handling expensesto be received by or on behalf of commodity schools in accordance withandSection; 240.5 of this chapter. That State agency shall promptly revisethe information required by this paragraph to reflect additions or deletionsof eligible schools and provide any necessary adjustment in the numberof lunches served.(c) <T3>Fiscal action. </T3>Fiscal action includes, but is not limited to,the recovery of overpayments through direct assessment or offset of futureclaims; disallowance of overclaims as reflected in unpaid Claims for Reimbursement;and correction of records to ensure that unfiled Claims for Reimbursementare corrected when filed. State agencies are responsible for ensuring programintegrity at the school food authority level. As such, they shall takefiscal action against school food authorities for Claims for Reimbursementthat are not properly payable under this part. In taking fiscal action,State agencies shall use their own procedures, within the constraints ofthis part, and shall maintain all records pertaining to action taken underthis section. The State shall determine the extent of fiscal action basedon the severity and longevity of the problems. The State agency may referto FNS for assistance in making a claims determination under this paragraph.(1) <T3>AIMS. </T3>When a State agency chooses to conduct AIMS reviews, asdescribed in andSection; 210.18(i), fiscal action may be taken on a firstreview: <T3>except</T3> fiscal action shall be taken when, under Performance Standard3, the number of meals claimed for school food authority reimbursementhas been incorrectly aggregated from individual school reports so thatan excessive number of meals has been claimed. State agencies shall takefiscal action on the second review for any degree of violation of AIMSPerformance Standards 2, 3 and 4. When a State agency chooses to conductAIMS audits, as described in andSection; 210.18(j), fiscal action shall beassessed for any degree of violation of Performance Standards 2, 3 and4. When a State agency develops its own compliance monitoring system inaccordance with andSection; 210.18(n), fiscal action shall be taken in accordancewith the criteria established under that system. The criteria shall beconsistent in principle with the fiscal action requirements for AIMS reviewsand audits as set forth in this section.(2) <T3>Failure to collect. </T3>If a State agency fails to disallow a claimor recover an overpayment from a school food authority, as described inthis section, FNS will notify the State agency that a claim may be assessedagainst the State agency. In all such cases, the State agency shall havefull opportunity to submit evidence concerning overpayment. If after consideringall available information, FNS determines that a claim is warranted, FNSwill assess a claim in the amount of such overpayment against the Stateagency. If the State agency fails to pay any such demand for funds promptly,FNS will reduce the State agency's Letter of Credit by the sum due in accordancewith FNS' existing offset procedures for Letter of Credit. In such event,the State agency shall provide the funds necessary to maintain Programoperations at the level of earnings from a source other than the Program.(3) <T3>Interest charge. </T3>If an agreement cannot be reached with the Stateagency for payment of its debts or for offset of debts on its current Letterof Credit, interest will be charged against the State agency from the datethe demand leter was sent, at the rate established by the Secretary ofTreasury.(4) <T3>Use of recovered payment.</T3> The amounts recovered by the State agencyfrom school food authorities may be utilized during the fiscal year forwhich the funds were initially available, first, to make payments to schoolfood authorities for the purposes of the Program; and second, to repayany State funds expended in the reimbursement of claims under the Programand not otherwise repaid. Any amounts recovered which are not so utilizedshall be returned to FNS in accordance with the requirements of this part.(5) <T3>Exception.</T3> In the event that the State agency finds, during aState review or State audit, that a school food authority is failing tomeet the quantities for each food item required under the meal patternin andSection; 210.10, the State agency need not disallow payment or collectan overpayment arising out of such failure, if the State agency takes suchother action as, in its opinion, will have a corrective effect.(6) <T3>Claims adjustment. </T3>FNS will have the authority to determine theamount of, to settle, and to adjust any claim arising under the Program,and to compromise or deny such claim or any part thereof. FNS will alsohave the authority to waive such claims if FNS determines that to do sowould serve the purposes of the Program. This provision shall not diminishthe authority of the Attorney General of the United States under section516 of Title 28, U.S. Code, to conduct litigation on behalf of the UnitedStates.(d) <T3>Management evaluations. </T3>Each State agency shall provide FNS withfull opportunity to conduct management evaluations of all State agencyProgram operations and shall provide OIG with full opportunity to conductaudits of all State agency Program operations. Each State agency shallmake available its records, including records of the receipt and disbursementof funds under the Program and records of any claim compromised in accordancewith paragraph (d)(1) of this section, upon a reasonable request by FNS,OIG, or the Comptroller General of the United States. FNS and OIG retainthe right to visit schools and OIG also has the right to make audits ofthe records and operations of any school.(1) <T3>Disregard overpayment. </T3>In conducting management evaluations oraudits for any fiscal year, the State agency, FNS, or OIG may disregardany overpayment which does not exceed $35 or, in the case of State agencyadministered programs, does not exceed the amount established under Statelaw, regulations, or procedure as a minimum amount for which claim willbe made for State losses. However, no overpayment is to be disregardedwhere there are unpaid claims of the same fiscal year from which the overpaymentcan be deducted or there is substantial evidence of violations of criminallaw or civil fraud statutes.(2) <T3>AIMS. </T3>As a part of its management evaluation of a State agency,FNS will evaluate the State's progress in effectively meeting the AIMSrequirements consistent with administrative responsibilities placed uponthe State agency by this part.(e) <T3>Additional requirements.</T3> Nothing contained in this part shallprevent a State agency from imposing additional requirements for participationin the Program which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this part.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 210.20</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Reporting and recordkeeping.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Reporting summary. </T3>Participating State agencies shall submit formsand reports to FNS to demonstrate compliance with Program requirements.The reports include but are not limited to: (1) Requests for cash to make reimbursement payments to school food authoritiesas required under andSection; 210.5(a);(2) Information on the amounts of Federal Program funds expended and obligatedto date (SF-269) as required under andSection; 210.5(d);(3) Statewide totals on Program participation (FNS-10) as required underandSection; 210.5(d);(4) Information on State funds provided by the State to meet the Statematching requirements (FNS-13) specified under andSection; 210.17(g);(5) Names of school food authorities found in violation of AIMS performancestandards on AIMS second reviews, together with information on the typeand extent of violations, as required under andSection; 210.18(l);(6) Result of AIMS reviews/audits as required under andSection; 210.18(l);and(7) Results of the commodity preference survey and recommendations forcommodity purchases as required under andSection; 210.27(d).(b) <T3>Recordkeeping summary. </T3>Participating State agencies are requiredto maintain records to demonstrate compliance with Program requirements.The records include but are not limited to:(1) Accounting records and source documents to control the receipt, custodyand disbursement of Federal Program funds as required under andSection; 210.5(a);(2) Documentation supporting all school food authority claims paid by theState agency as required under andSection; 210.5(d);(3) Documentation to support the amount the State agency reported havingused for State revenue matching as required under andSection; 210.17(h);(4) Records supporting the State agency's review of net cash resourcesas required under andSection; 210.18(b);(5) Reports on the results of investigations of complaints received orirregularities noted in connection with Program operations as requiredunder andSection; 210.18(e)(6) Confirmation of a State agency's approval of a school food authority'sAIMS corrective action plan as required under andSection; 210.18(i) and recordsof all AIMS reviews and audits, including records of action taken to correctprogram deficiencies as required under andSection; 210.18(m);(7) State agency criteria, for selecting schools for AIMS reviews and smallschool food authorities for AIMS second reviews as required under andSection;210.18(m);(8) Documentation of action taken to disallow improper claims submittedby school food authorities, as required by andSection; 210.19(c) and as determinedthrough claims processing, resulting from actions such as AIMS reviews,AIMS audits, and USDA audits;(9) Records of USDA audit findings, State agency's and school food authorities'responses to them and of corrective action taken as required by andSection;210.22(a);(10) Records pertaining to civil rights responsibilities as defined underandSection; 210.23(b); and(11) Records pertaining to the annual food preference survey of schoolfood authorities as required by andSection; 210.27(d).<ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart E_State Agency and School Food Authority Responsibilities</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 210.21</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procurement.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>State agencies and school food authorities shall complywith the requirements of 7 CFR Part 3015 concerning the procurement ofsupplies, food, equipment and other services with Program funds.
