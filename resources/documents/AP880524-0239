Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., filed a petitionTuesday to halt debate. That measure, known as a cloture vote,cannot come up for a vote before Thursday.   ``It's conceivable that we could finish the work on the treatyby Friday or Saturday,'' Byrd told reporters after a White Housemeeting with Reagan to discuss the May 29-June 2 summit between thepresident and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., agreed with Byrd thattime remains before the summit to ratify the Intermediate-rangeNuclear Forces treaty. ``We can make it if we start staying in lateand we file cloture today,'' he told reporters.   A successful cloture motion, which would limit debate, requires60 votes. Far more than 60 senators have supported the treaty in aseries of early-round test votes. Approval of a cloture motionThursday would begin a 30-hour clock for debate, meaning a vote onthe treaty could occur Friday.   Byrd said he wants the Senate to act before Reagan meetsGorbachev. ``I think the president's hand would be strengthenedthere and I think it would be in the interests of our own countryto have the president with the instruments of ratification.''   GOP conservatives opposed to the pact have used Senate rules,which are designed to protect the minority, to delay a vote on thepact signed Dec. 8 by Reagan and Gorbachev.   Reagan, setting the stage for the summit, said Tuesday he hopedto conclude a treaty to cut long-range nuclear arsenals before histerm expires in eight months. But acknowledged that might not bepossible.   ``It is the requirements of a good treaty and not some arbitrarydeadline that will determine the timetable,'' Reagan said in anaddress beamed across Europe on the U.S. Information Agency's``Worldnet'' satellite service. The speech was taped Monday in theOval Office.   The INF treaty requires the elimination within three years ofall U.S. and Soviet missiles with a range of 300 miles to 3,400miles.   When the Senate finally votes on the pact, ratification isassured, Dole noted, because only 67 votes are required. ``Thequestion is how many votes are going to be for it,'' he said. ``Isit going to be 94, 95, 92? It's not even close.''   In a Senate speech, Dole appealed to his fellow party members tosupport Reagan. ``I hope, as the Republican leader speaking for myRepublican president who's in the last year of his second term,that we might be able to accommodate him in this instance.''   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the chief opponent, refused tomute his criticism.   Helms noted his long support of Reagan, but said, ``I think he'swrong on this treaty, I think he's been misled, I think he's beenmisguided and my conscience will not allow me not to pursue theobvious defects of this treaty.''   Helms noted that nine GOP-backed amendments have been defeatedoverwhelmingly.   ``All amendments have been rejected because the State Departmentcame to the Foreign Relations Committee and said there must be noamendments to this treaty because the Soviets won't like it. ... Ihappen to be one of those senators who don't care whether theSoviets like it or not.''   Referring to Gorbachev, Helms said, ``I don't care whether weoffend him or not. Let's get it right the first time before theSenate attaches its approval to the ratification of the treaty.''   Later Tuesday, Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., said hesupported the move to halt debate. ``Why should a small majoritydeprive the vast majority of this and the people of this country,its will _ ratification before the summit?''   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., agreed, telling his colleagues,``We're going to approve this treaty. It's only a question of howmany votes. ... I think it'll get 90 votes.''   He accused opponents of ``nuclear idolatry'' and said ``theideologues will never, never go gently into the night.''</TEXT></DOC>
