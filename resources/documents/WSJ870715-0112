Harris Jr.Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> NOCEARNINGS (ERN)AEROSPACE (ARO) </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Northrop Corp. reported a second-quarter loss of $15.4 million, reflecting its previously reported $124.3 million pre-tax write-down from a secret program analysts believe to be Northrop's Stealth bomber contract.    The loss compares with net income of $23.1 million, or 49 cents a share, in the year-earlier period, when the aerospace concern's earnings were hurt by provisions for company spending on a different classified program Northrop didn't identify. Sales increased 1.7% in the latest quarter to $1.42 billion from $1.40 billion.    Northrop didn't specify the work that resulted in the $124.3 million write-down, equal to $75 million, or $1.59 a share, after tax. But its description of the project in question as &quot;a classified, long-term research and development contract&quot; evoked language it previously has used for the Stealth aircraft, also known as the advanced technology bomber. Believed to be Northrop's largest current program, the radar-eluding Air Force bomber is expected to enter service in the 1990s.    While contract details are classified, the Air Force has said it wants 132 of the planes at a total price of $36.6 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Northrop shares closed at $43.75, up 62.5 cents. Some securities analysts had said last month, when Northrop disclosed plans for the write-down, that they expected a larger loss.    Northrop's latest write-off follows a separate $90-million pre-tax charge that Northrop took last year, apparently also related to its cost increases on the Stealth bomber. Rumors of cost overruns on the program have led members of Congress to criticize the secrecy surrounding its finances. And, under pressure from the House Armed Services Committee, the Air Force recently began studying ways to introduce competition from other contractors into the bomber program.    Northrop's prepared statement said the latest second-quarter and six-month results also included lower operating margins on the company's contracts to build guidance equipment for the MX strategic nuclear missile. Northrop is behind in its delivery schedule for inertial measurement units for the missile, and the Air Force has been withholding Northrop's $25-million monthly contract payments.    In addition, current and former Northrop employees have filed suit against Northrop alleging a variety of irregularities in the handling of parts and other aspects of the program. Employees also have testified before a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, and the Air Force is looking into related issues.    Northrop has maintained that its problems with the MX are administrative, and it has replaced the program's managers. However, a congressional committee is investigating whether the alleged irregularities have hurt the missile's reliability or accuracy. The Air Force recently formed a scientific advisory board to look into these issues.    The company said yesterday that transition to production from developmental work under its MX contract also led to lower sales from that program.    Other factors cited by Northrop for the second-quarter loss included lower margins for electronic countermeasures for the F-15 jet fighter and an absence of deliveries of its F-5 fighters. Higher levels of research and development work and increased deliveries under its F/A-18 subcontract partly offset those reductions, it said. Northrop also wrote off $39 million in the 1986 quarter on the F-20, a fighter program that it discontinued late last year.    Northrop said its net in the first half fell 60% to $25.2 million, or 54 cents a share, from the year-earlier $62.4 million, or $1.34 a share. Sales in the half rose 5.2% to $2.83 billion from $2.69 billion.    Its backlog of orders on June 30 was $3.86 billion, Northrop said, 15% lower than the $4.53 billion backlog at midyear 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
