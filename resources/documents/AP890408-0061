Instead, the bloodiest fighting of Namibia's 23-year bush warerupted, making a mockery of a cease-fire, jeopardizing thecredibility of a U.N. monitoring operation, and killing scores ofyoung guerrillas before they could savor the independence for whichthey fought.   In the war-ravaged northern region of Ovambo, where most of theinsurgents' supporters live, a dusk-to-dawn curfew is back in forceafter a seven-week lull, and deep-rooted cynicism about theprospects for independence from South Africa has returned.   ``Namibian soil now bleeds when in fact (the people) should berejoicing,'' said the Namibian Council of Churches.   There is agreement on what prompted the clashes _ the presenceof hundreds of well-armed South-West Africa People's Organizationguerrillas in northern Namibia on April 1, the day that theU.N.-supervised truce was to have taken effect.   But why it happened _ after six months without major hostilities_ remains in dispute. Why would SWAPO risk confrontation on thevery day that an 11-year-old independence plan was implemented,calling for elections which the guerrilla movement was favored towin?   South Africa, Namibia's ruler since World War I, says theguerrillas staged a cross-border incursion while they were supposedto have been at least 100 miles inside Angola as part of anagreement to confine combatants from both sides to their bases.   SWAPO's aim, said South African Foriegn Minister Pik Botha, wasto set up bases after the cease-fire had neutralized securityforces, and then proclaim to the world that the bases wereestablished through military prowess.   SWAPO's president, Sam Nujoma, says most of the guerrillasinvolved in the fighting had been in Namibia all along and wereprepared to place themselves under U.N. control on April 1. Theinsurgents thought they would be safe once the truce started anddid not expect to be hunted down by military-style police units,other SWAPO officials said.   Villagers in Ovambo have recounted how cheerful SWAPO guerrillasseemed to be expecting a hero's welcome rather than a war when theyarrived.   Officials from the United Nations, the United States, Britainand elsewhere have supported South Africa's assertion that theguerrillas did infiltrate from Angola. SWAPO had no known bases inNamibia, and Cedric Thornberry, second-in-command of the monitoringforce, said the U.N. plan made no provisions for such bases.   Botha boasted during the week that South Africa's internationalimage had been enhanced by the Namibian crisis, while SWAPO hadbeen discredited.   Even the Organization of African Unity and the front-line statesof southern Africa, two persistent critics of Botha's government,refrained from attacking South Africa when they issued statementsof concern about Namibia.   However, African nations expressed sympathy for SWAPO andaccused the United Nations of incompetence.   The leaders of the U.N. monitoring force have encounteredparticularly harsh criticism for allowing South African militaryunits to leave their bases and join police in anti-guerrillaoperations.   The Namibian Council of Churches, in a report based on a visitby clergymen to the war zone, said that when Ovambo residents inthe north tried to report incidents, two U.N. officers refused tostop reading their novels and a third ``was intoxicated and of nohelp at all.''   During the week of combat, less than 1,000 soldiers of theplanned 4,650-member U.N. military monitoring force were inNamibia, and only a handful of observers were in Ovambo. SWAPO andits Third World allies had insisted even this full figure wasinadequate and called for the United Nations to expand the force to7,500, as was originally planned.   A major question now is whether any reconciliation can beachieved if the independence plan is able to proceed.   SWAPO had been favored to gain the most votes inpre-independence elections scheduled for November, and the fightingdoes not appear to have dampened its support in Ovambo, where abouthalf of Namibia's 1.3 million people live.   But elsewhere, parties opposed to SWAPO hope to capitalize onwhat they view as a huge blunder by the guerrillas. Leaders of theDemocratic Turnhalle Alliance, which depicts itself a moderatealternative to SWAPO, said its supporters could be drawn intoconflict with SWAPO backers because of the fighting in the north.   Thornberry, at one of several hectic news briefings during theweek, said Namibia ``is in danger of bleeding to death.''</TEXT></DOC>
