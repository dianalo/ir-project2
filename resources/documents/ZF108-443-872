(DCA) IRMA board, are ableto offer PC-to-mainframe access, but only by temporarily lobotomizing PCs toallow them to look like dedicated dumb terminals.andM;Unfortunately, users who are comfortable with a PC's ease of use quickly growfrustrated with the cryptic screens and arcane commands required to interactwith a mainframe application.andM;PC Week tested four products that can be used to automate complicated hostsessions and to create attractive and easy-to-use micro-to-mainframeinterfaces: Attachmate Corp.'s Now!andP;  PC/Host Autoware; CDI Systems Inc.'sAutoKey/3270; Direct Technology Ltd.'s Automator; and Software Corporation ofAmerica Inc.'s Gateway PC.andM;Although they take different approaches, each of these products includesautomating abilities based on scripts or command languages.andP;  PC Weekattempted to write an application with each product that automated a commonmicro-to-mainframe scenario.andP;  The application logged a PC user on to a host,checked IBM's Professional Office System (PROFS) for E-mail and copied anymail to a DOS file on the PC.andM;The programs were tested on a Zenith Data Systems Z-248 with 1M byte of RAMusing DCA's IRMA card to provide the connection to the host.andP;  Because theyalso support asynchronous communications, Automator mi and Gateway PC werealso tested on a Packard Bell Force 386SX connected to the hostasynchronously with a Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc. 2,400-bps modem.andM;Gateway PC proved to be the best over-all development tool.andP;  It offers anextremely powerful programming language, and also handles all communicationsand terminal emulation.andP;  Its underlying communication environment deals wellwith both coaxial and asynchronous protocols.andM;Automator's control language proved to be just as powerful.andP;  However, it doesnot provide its own communications platform, relying instead on whatevercommunications applications are installed in a user's PC.andM;Developing an application with AutoKey/3270 and Now! was more difficult; bothproducts require that some compromises be made in the test application.andP;  Inaddition, Now! requires that a 3270 emulation card's associated applicationprogramming interface be installed.andM;Automator can be used to create a completely menu-driven system to automatethe most complicated communications.andM;But at $1,995, it costs over three times more than the next most expensiveproduct reviewed, Attachmate's Now!.andP;  (See Specs table, Page 110.)andO;Nevertheless, the time it saves users from having to custom-code anapplication could justify the price.andM;If buyers need a powerful and easy communications system, Gateway PC, withits tightly integrated menuing, communications and script language, could bethe package to choose.andM;For automating a relatively simple communications session, CDI's AutoKey/3270is probably the best buy.andP;  It offers helpful screens that can be widelydistributed.andM;Now! is a good tool for individuals who regularly interact with a mainframeand want to streamline the process.andP;  Its simplicity and good documentationmake it a practical tool for users with varying levels of technicalexpertise.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
