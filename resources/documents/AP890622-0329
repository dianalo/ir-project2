I think they'll accept it,'' said JackParton, director of USW District 31 and chief negotiator with thenation's fourth-largest steel producer.   Inland originally wanted concessions, including the right toschedule workers for a 12-hour work day, Parton said. The companyalso wanted the employees to help pay medical insurance premiums.Both demands were withdrawn by company negotiators.   Incentive pay will be increased in the fourth year, and theagreement also improves pension benefits and resolves differencesover the status of maintenance jobs, he said.   Inland's workers gave no wage concessions in the 1986negotiations, so there was no restoration of past sacrifices.   The talks began March 7, earliest among four major producers whoshared July 31 contract expirations. By a self-imposed settlementdeadline of March 31, Inland still was demanding concessions and hadoffered no wage increase, Parton said.   ``We hadn't had a raise in about eight years, when inflation was22 percent. The company made a big buck. Management got raises. Theydeserve raises, but so do we,'' Parton said.   By late May ``we still couldn't convince our counterparts thatour members were entitled to share in those profits,'' he said. ``Westarted preparing for a strike.''   The 12,000 USW members at Inland were hearing late in thebargaining that a sticking point remained over wage increases in thefirst year, and their fellow union members at National Steel Corp.this week surprised negotiators by rejecting a 50-month offer inpart because it offered less money up front than workers acceptedfrom Bethlehem Steel Corp.   The Inland settlement came around 4 a.m. in Chicago, where thecompany is based.</TEXT></DOC>
