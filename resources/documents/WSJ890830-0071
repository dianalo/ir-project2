Grimm andamp; Co. said the number of corporate acquisitions announced rose 22% in the first half, to 1,365 from 1,119 a year earlier.    The company, a division of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s Merrill Lynch Business Brokerage andamp; Valuation Services, said the purchase price of acquisitions in the first six months totaled $122.2 billion, the second highest on record, and down 5.5% from the record $129.4 billion in the 1988 first half.    There were 167 transactions valued at more than $100 million in the 1989 first half, down 14% from 195 a year earlier; the number of $1 billion-plus transactions fell 40%, to 18 from 30. The average acquisition was valued at $203.7 million, down from $212.5 million a year ago.    The tally includes both proposed and pending merger and acquisition offers, and in some cases competing offers for the same target company.    The largest transaction in the first half was the acquisition of Smithkline Beckman Corp. for $16.1 billion by Beecham Group PLC. Of the 10 largest deals in the period, two others also involved foreign companies: Exxon Corp.'s purchase of Texaco Canada Inc. for $4.1 billion and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts' spinoff of five European food businesses acquired in the RJR/Nabisco acquisition to BSN SA of France for $2.5 billion.    Sales of foreign companies to American corporations rose 62% in the first half to 105, and totaled $13.7 billion, compared with $5.3 billion a year earlier. Purchases of American companies by foreign entities fell slightly, to 149 with a value of $29.9 billion from 151 at a total of $31.3 billion.    The United Kingdom remained the most active arena for both foreign buyers and sellers, with 41 purchases and 34 sales, followed by Canada, 30 acquisitions and 23 sales.    The second-largest transaction in the first half was Time-Warner Inc.'s $11.7 billion acquisition of Warner Communications Inc.    Grimm's report said divestitures accounted for 45% of all acquisitions in the latest period, reflecting &quot;a continuing and growing trend as corporations divest unrelated or unprofitable operations.&quot;    Grimm said the latest figures indicate that the number of transactions this year will be higher than the previous five-year average. &quot;Total dollar value paid so far in 1989 is on track to finish a close second to last year's record $247 billion, with takeovers of large, well-managed companies leading the way.&quot;    The survey indicated that the number of merger and acquisition announcements rose 24% in the first quarter, to 734, and 20% in the second quarter, to 631. </TEXT></DOC>
