Whatever the fate of their candidacies, it is almost certainthat Social Security will remain an issue in this campaign, just asit has been in the last three national elections.   What the surviving candidates are likely to be debating,however, is not du Pont's idea for allowing young workers to opentax-free retirement accounts or Babbitt's call for taxing all ofwealthy retirees' benefits, but who can offer the most ironcladpromise to keep those Social Security checks and cost-of-livingincreases coming.   Concern about Social Security ``is in the bone marrow of theelectorate,'' said Democratic pollster Peter Hart.   Six years ago, when Social Security had barely enough money inthe till to pay benefits on time each month, senior citizens hadsomething to worry about.   But after the bipartisan rescue plan of 1983, which increasedsome taxes, froze benefits for six months and raised the retirementage to 67 in the next century, the Social Security system beganrolling up big surpluses. The economic spurt after the 1982-83recession and the sharp drop in unemployment hastened its recovery.   Social Security's trust funds started this year with $67billion. By next January, they will have grown to $104 billion.They will swell to $400 billion by 1994 and $1 trillion-plus beforethe turn of the century.   Those big surpluses are the main reason the so-called notchbabies are mounting a widening campaign to have their benefitsraised closer to those born in 1916 and earlier. Congress made amistake in 1972 that gave the latter group more than they wereentitled to. The notch babies _ primarily the 7 million people bornbetween 1917 and 1921 _ contend they got cheated when Congressrejiggerred the benefit formula in 1977.   Several Democrats and Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., have promised tolook into the issue of equity for the notch babies, whose benefitincreases would cost tens of billions of dollars.   Du Pont, the former Delaware governor who contends the systemwill crash in the next century under the weight of the retired babyboomers unless drastic changes are made, finished a distant fifthin Iowa.   Republican Pat Robertson, who like du Pont favors moves toprivitize Social Security, finished a strong second, but it was hisstand on moral issues, not pensions, that galvanized his Iowasupporters.   Kemp, the Republicans' most vigorous defender of the status quoin Social Security, was fourth, but hoping to move up in NewHampshire with his unbridled attacks on Sen. Bob Dole and VicePresident George Bush for supporting a freeze on Social Security in1985.   Dole tells voters everywhere he goes about his role on theNational Commission on Social Security Reform in 1983, when theKansas senator helped hammer out a last-minute compromise that putSocial Security back in the black.   ``You don't have to worry about it being broke. You don't haveto worry about getting your checks. And there I made adifference,'' says Dole, who also points out that Kemp votedagainst the Social Security rescue plan. The New York congressmansays he didn't like its payroll tax increases.   Du Pont has accused Kemp of repeatedly misrepresenting his planto allow workers to set up tax-free savings accounts if theyrelinquish future Social Security benefits. Du Pont says Kemp'sattacks ``remind me of the demagoguery practices by the DemocraticParty in the 1982 elections.''   Dole and other Republicans have said it was the Democrats'pounding on senior citizens' fear of Social Security cuts orfreezes that cost the GOP control of the Senate in 1986.   On the Democrats' side, Babbitt has called for ``a universalneeds test to discipline government programs,'' including SocialSecurity, and suggested making wealthier retirees pay income tax onall their benefits instead of half.   Gary Hart also has suggested taxing 85 percent of the benefits.   The other Democrats generally have been vowing to safeguardSocial Security and its COLAs. As Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouriput it, ``We're going to keep it away from the Republican budgetknives forever.''   But Social Security's trust funds will always be tempting forbudget knives. They are expected to peak at $12 trillion _ $2.5trillion in today's dollars _ around 2020, then be drawn down tonothing by 2050 to help pay the baby boomers' retirement.   Du Pont and Robertson have argued that even when the trust fundsare full, they will contain nothing but government IOU's. To payoff those IOU's _ actually, interest-bearing Treasury bonds _ duPont says, ``we face a big tax increase.''   When du Pont asked 80 people at a debate in Manchester, N.H.,how many thought Social Security would be there for them at 65,three people raised their hands.   More scientific polls have shown young workers remain dubiousabout their personal prospects for Social Security.   But that sentiment has not translated into support forpoliticians such as du Pont and Babbitt who suggest overhauling oreven tinkering with Social Security.   Social Security will always be a political issue, simply becauseit is such a massive part of what the government does, and thesingle largest source of income for 35 percent of the elderly.   Paul Maslin, Simon's pollster, said, ``The elites have attemptedto move the debate in a direction the voters don't want to moveyet.'' Young voters don't expect to get Social Security themselves,Maslin said, but they do expect it to be there for their parents.   ``For all of the provocation, the voters are still on the sideof protection,'' said Maslin. ``They understand that if thegovernment does not provide those benefits, they are going to haveto pay for their parents' retirement or health problems.''</TEXT></DOC>
