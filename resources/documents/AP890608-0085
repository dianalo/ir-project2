Gorbachev urged the deputiesas they left the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses.   Earlier, a radical economist told the parliament the countryshould cut aid to the Kremlin's Latin America allies and pay farmersin hard currency to help avert imminent economic collapse.   Another deputy said the country was on the brink of ecologicaldisaster.   The deputies walked out after they objected to formation of acommittee by the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies thatwill decide whether laws conform to the Soviet Constitution. Theysaid the committee could encroach on their republics. Thelegislatures of Estonia and Lithuania have proclaimed the right toveto laws approved by the central government in Moscow.   ``Our electors ordered us to take care of the sovereignty of ourrepublics,'' said Romas V. Gudaitis, a writer from Lithuania. ``Weconsider the elections of the Constitutional Inspection Committee tobe without purpose and we will not take part in them.''   Lithuanian deputies, among the most vocal at the session thatbegan on May 25, led the walkout, the Tass news agency reported. Itwas not immediately clear if other representatives joined them.   Soviet TV cameras, in a live broadcast of the sesssion, showedabout 25 deputies storming out.   Baltic deputies complained that they had not had enough time tostudy the committee's functions, and said the matter should bepostponed until the parliament's fall session.   ``The question is so serious let's not hurry,'' said Igor Gryazinof Tartu in Estonia.   The Congress voted overwhelmingly to form the committee, but 433deputies opposed this.   Gorbachev said he would consult with the deputies who objectedand that the issue would be taken up again on Friday.   The walkout was the first since the Congress convened and was themost dramatic sign of opposition to the Communist Partyestablishment that runs the session and nominates committee membersand other officials.   Earlier today, economist Nikolai Shmelev warned that ifsnowballing inflation, worsening consumer shortages and the``monstrous budget deficit'' are not halted, ``in two or three yearswe could face an economic crash.''   Shmelev, one of the Soviet Union's most prominent reform-mindedeconomists, said Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov's economic programunderestimates the gravity of the country's crisis.   Ryzhkov on Wednesday announced plans for defense cuts andgovernment relief for the nearly 40 million Soviet citizens he saidwere living below the poverty line.   Shmelev said the government must do away with Gorbachev'santi-alcohol campaign and import more than $15 billion of goods toease the country's consumer crisis.   Gorbachev's cutbacks on alcohol sales, introduced two monthsafter he came to power in March 1985, led to massive losses ofgovernment revenue and widespread home-distilling.   Shmelev said the hard currency to pay for imports could comepartly from motivating Soviet farmers to work harder by offeringrewards in foreign currency.   Deputies applauded when he suggested the government tellcollective farm chairmen ``if they sell grain and meat to the stateabove a certain level they will be paid in hard currency with theright of spending it wherever they want.''   The extra crops they produce would be cheaper than the currentSoviet practice of buying grain abroad to make up for shortfalls indomestic harvests, he said.   Shmelev also called for a cut in aid to Latin America.   Quoting U.S. estimates that the Soviet Union spends $6 billion to$8 billion on activities there, especially in aid to Cuba, he said``no one understands what a significant portion of that money isspent on.''   His speech was in line with the vocal, combative role assumed bysome members of the new Congress. In the past, Soviet lawmakersdocilely adopted any measure submitted by Kremlin leaders.   Deputy Alexi Yablokov, a Moscow biologist, said the governmentshould stop issuing economic decrees.   ``Our national economy reminds me of a frog,'' he said. ``Everyone of its jumps is a decree. Sometimes it jumps straight ahead,sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left depending on whatscares it at the moment.''   Yakblovkov also said every third Soviet man will suffer fromcancer caused by pollution. He blamed the country's massiveecological problems on loss of local control.   Ryzhkov, in his economic program presented to Congress onWednesday, said the Kremlin would continue trimming defense spendingthrough 1995 and reduce the amount of national income spent ondefense by up to 50 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
