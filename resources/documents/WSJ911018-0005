The genetic manipulation used in the tomato probably canbe used to sharply prolong the shelf life of other fruits andvegetables including bananas, apples and lettuce and mighteven delay the wilting of flowers, predicted AthanasiosTheologis, the plant molecular biologist who headed the teamthat developed the tomato at the Plant Gene Expression Centerin Albany, Calif. The center is a joint venture of the U.S.Department of Agriculture and the University of California,Berkeley.</LP><TEXT>   According to their report in this week's issue of thejournal Science, the California scientists inserted geneticmaterial into tomato plants that blocked the functioning of agene. The gene in this case was one that normally triggersthe ripening of the tomato.   By blocking the gene, the scientists delayed the ripeningof tomatoes by one to three months. Tomatoes normally ripenabout 60 days after the plant has been pollinated. &quot;We've hadtomatoes on the vine for 150 days and the plants have diedand the tomatoes still haven't ripened,&quot; Dr. Theologis said.Similar delays in ripening would occur for tomatoes that hadbeen picked and were in transit to markets, he said.   Once the unripened tomatoes reach the market, the ripeningprocess can be triggered by exposing the tomatoes to ethylenegas, the same procedure currently used to spur ripening oftomatoes that are picked green for shipment.   Dr. Theologis said the genetic manipulation doesn't affectthe taste of the tomato. The common complaints about thetaste of grocery store tomatoes -- or lack of taste -- aretraceable to breeding of tomatoes to prevent bruising anddamage during handling and have nothing to do with theripening of the fruits, he said.   The new experiments settle a scientific question about therole of ethylene in fruit, vegetable and flower senescence,or ripening and spoiling, Dr. Theologis explained. Manyplants produce ethylene as they ripen, but there's beendebate over whether the ethylene is what triggers theripening process or whether it's a by-product of the process.   In the new experiments, the scientists blocked a gene thatswitches on the plant's manufacture of ethylene. Since theripening of the tomato was delayed, the experiments provethat ethylene triggers the ripening process.   Dr. Theologis suggested that when warehouses or shippingcompanies want to trigger the ripening of the geneticallyaltered fruits and vegetables, they can place them adjacentto some normal fruits or vegetables that exude ethylene asthey ripen.   A similar gene-blocking approach is being used in tomatoesby Calgene Inc., the plant biotechnology company in Davis,Calif. Calgene scientists, however, block a gene that causestomatoes to soften during the ripening process whereas thenew experiments block the gene that triggers ripening.Delaying the softening of the tomatoes adds to their shelflife although not as long as blocking the ripening gene.Calgene said it is growing a test crop and hopes to marketsuch tomatoes in 1993.   To block the genes, both research groups use an&quot;anti-sense&quot; version of the genetic material, messenger RNA.Ordinarily, RNA is what copies the message spelled out in agene and translates it into the manufacture of a protein. An&quot;anti-sense&quot; RNA cancels out the &quot;sense&quot; message of thenormal RNA and thus prevents the gene's message from beingtranslated into a protein.</TEXT></DOC>
