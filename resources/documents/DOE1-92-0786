It will take the bestand most promising of the advanced coal-based processing and emissionscontrol technologies and over the next decade move them from the proof-of-conceptstage into the commercial marketplace through demonstration. These demonstrationswill be at a scale large enough to generate all data (from design, construction,and operation) necessary for the private sector to judge their commercialpotential and to make informed commercial decisions. In this manner,the program serves as a bridge between research and development and themarketplace. The majority of the innovative clean coal technologies inthis program are generally grouped into one of three categories: (1)retrofit technologies that can be used on existing plants to reduce emissions,(2) repowering technologies that replace a significant portion of theoriginal plant and increase the power output of the facility, and (3)conversion technologies that have applicability in the industrial, commercial,transportation, and residential markets by utilizing coal conversionprocesses that produce liquid and gaseous fuels.</TEXT></DOC>
