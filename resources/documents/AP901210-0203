But what willthat mean for the future of humanity?</TEXT><TEXT/><BYLINE>By NANCY SHULINS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><TEXT>   It's a dog-eat-dog world inside Danny Hillis' computer, home to64,000 competing programs. Only the fittest will survive.   Fitness, in this 5-foot universe, is the ability to sort lettersalphabetically. But Hillis, its creator, doesn't teach his programshow to sort. Instead, he sets up a world in which programs withsorting ability are more likely to survive. Then he waits.   The early programs are terrible sorters. The worst are killedoff right away. Some put `A' before `Z' by blind luck, but that'sgood enough. They ``mate,'' merging successful traits in``offspring'' that do better still.   Evolution proceeds at a dizzying pace. The result, after 10,000generations: ``A better program for alphabetical sorting thananything I could write,'' says Hillis, a programmer with adoctorate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   There can be no doubt the software that evolved in Hillis'computer is superior to anything a human could produce.   The question is, is it alive?   Probably not - or as Hillis is apt to answer, not yet. But tohim and other scientists on the frontier known as artificial life,it's only a matter of time before life becomes - literally - whatwe make of it.   Artificial life, like artificial intelligence, is an attempt tocoax lifelike behavior from non-living material - silicon,chemicals, even LEGOs.   ``A-lifers'' - biologists, chemists, physicists, mathematiciansand computer scientists - envision a not-so-distant futureinhabited by evolving software, sentient robots, and life formsbased on chemicals other than carbon.   ``We are all going to be living in a world filled withartificial life forms we haven't yet imagined,'' says UCLAbiologist Charles Taylor.   Christopher Langton of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in NewMexico predicts artificial life will emerge on its own,spontaneously surfacing within complex computer networks just asthe first biological life did on Earth 3{ billion years ago.   His colleague, physicist J. Doyne Farmer, goes even further:Artificial life could surpass its creators, ultimately occupyingthe next rung on the evolutionary ladder.   The prospect unleashes primal fears of humanity's creationsgrowing out of control, culminating in our destruction. Researchersacknowledge the fear. Some even profess to share it, but say thescientist's role is to press on and hope for the best. ``Humanshave a way of muddling through,'' says John H. Holland, an engineerand computer scientist at the University of Michigan. ``I suspectwe'll find ways to keep ourselves safe.''   Despite the science fiction overtones, artificial life researchfocuses on furthering understanding of biological life, and much ofit rests on a bedrock of scientific fact.   ``Scientists used to think that the origin of life was a uniqueevent - just this bolt of lightning, just that temperature,''Langton says.   How life began remains a mystery. But the notion of life as anatural proess as opposed to a freak accident is among the tenetsof modern biology.   While no one knows how the first living cell was formed, thecomplexity of even the simplest bacteria points to a long series ofsmall, distinct steps. Picture a Boeing 747 spontaneouslyassembling in a tornado-torn scrap yard; that, says Britishastronomer Sir Fred Hoyle, is about as likely as a living cellcoming together in a single shot.   The steps required mandate that life was no accident. ``Amultistep process that relies on one improbable event followingupon the other is bound to abort sooner or later,'' Nobel laureateChristian de Duve of The Rockefeller University wrote recently.   The assumption that life is defined by the organization andinteraction of its parts rather than the material it's made of liesat the heart of artificial life research.   The first cell was composed of carbon-based polymers, as are weall, but not because the stuff has mystical properties. ``You canfind the material we're made of all around,'' says physicist HowardPattee of the State University of New York at Binghamton. ``We weremade from whatever was handy.''   ``The material is immaterial,'' says Langton, to whom buildinglife isn't so different from building, say, a computer.   ``You can build a computer out of tubes carrying water,electronic chips or even Tinkertoys. What's important is that youhave the right functions related in the right way. Some of us thinkthat's also true of life.''   Then why don't we see new forms springing up all the time?``Other life either out-competes it, eats it or erases its base ofsupport,'' Langton says.   But concoct the right blend of materials in a controlledenvironment, he says, and life will emerge. Biologists believeself-organization is a natural property of matter, though theprocess by which it occurs is another mystery.   ``We believe the chemical soup on Earth, when left alone formillions of years, sprouted flowers and frogs and people,'' Hillissays. ``Yet the rules of chemistry are pretty simple. It's hard tobelieve something that simple could produce something ascomplicated as a person.''   Understanding how simple rules give rise to complex behavior isthe holy grail of artificial life research, for therein lies thekey to all life, scientists theorize. Already, they are fashioningcomplex worlds based on simple rules within the finite universe ofcomputers, seeking new insights into age-old questions. Some areusing chemicals to model emergent properties. Others are buildingmechanical representations.   The questions they hope to answer are formidable: What is life?When does it begin? What factors speed evolution? Natural selectionensures that species improve from one generation to the next. Butwhat process makes individuals improve? How does adaptation in onespecies affect another? If this year's frog develops a stickytongue, what does that do to next year's fly?   Not the least of the questions concerns humanity's future. ``Wetend to assume evolution stops with us. Clearly, that's not thecase,'' Langton says. ``So far, compared to ancient creatures,we're just a flash in the pan.''   What does artificial life portend for humans? ``We may be thefirst species to create its own successors,'' Farmer says.   Rest assured, however. Creatures unveiled at an artificial lifeconference in New Mexico last winter posed no imminent threat.   Electronic ``ants'' negotiated a computer-generated maze in asystem called Genesys, created by David Jefferson and CharlesTaylor of UCLA. Each ant was composed of strands of computer code(``genes'') that determined its ability to move in variousdirections. The gens of the first ants were randomly generated,and most quickly died. The fittest survived to pass their superiorgenes on to offspring, and so on. As with Hillis' alphabet-sortingprograms, performance improved as evolution progressed.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
