Muldoon wasconvicted Thursday of charges that he helped a defense firm funnelbribes to a Marine Corps contracting official for help gettingPentagon contracts.   Muldoon, 59, was convicted of eight charges by a federal courtjury in Alexandria, Va., that acquitted a former executive ofWhittaker Corp. of all charges that he participated in the briberyscheme.   Jurors deliberated more than six hours before convicting Muldoonof bribery, conspiracy and interstate travel in aid of thecommission of a felony.   The jury acquitted Leonard L. Ingram, the former Whittakerexecutive, of all nine charges against him.   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton scheduled Muldoon'ssentencing for Feb. 16. He could be sentenced up to 70 years inprison and fined more than $1 million.   Muldoon, described by prosecutors as an important figure in thePentagon procurement scandal, was found guilty of participating ina scheme to funnel bribes to Jack A. Sherman, a former Marine Corpscivilian contracting supervisor.   The scandal is at the heart of a multi-year investigation bygovernment agents, who code-named their operation ``Ill Wind.''   Sherman, who pleaded guilty to other bribery charges, testifiedthat he solicted more than $80,000 from Lee Telecommunications,which was taken over by Whittaker in 1986, in return for helpingthe company get electronics contracts.   Sherman testified that he agreed to split payments from Lee withMuldoon and two other defense consultants.   During the trial he recalled receiving about $25,000 fromMuldoon, who served as a conduit between Lee and Sherman. Muldoontook a two-thirds share of what Lee paid them, Sherman said.   Muldoon called no witnesses on his behalf during the trial,which began Monday.   Ingram, 51, a retired Marine Corps major who now lives inHuntsville, Ala., testified that he opposed the company's scheme tobribe Sherman.   Ingram was he was told by another company official, ScottLamberth to mind his own business.   Ingram, who was a stockholder and vice president of Lee, becamea vice president of Whittaker Command and Control Systems after the1986 takeover.   ``Ill Wind blew itself out,'' Ingram's lawyer, Marcus Topel saidafter the verdict. ``In their zeal to broaden this investigation,(prosecutors) put too much reliance on the credibility of theirinformants.''   Topel said Sherman ``is probably the sleaziest witness andprobably one of the most disreputable persons I've seen in mycareer.''   The Whittaker subsidiary pleaded guilty to participating in thebribery scheme and paid $3.5 million in fines and penalties.Lamberth and another former executive of Lee-Whittaker, JohnFranklin Van Tassel also pleaded guilty guilty.   They both testified at the trial and were scheduled to besentenced Friday by Hilton.</TEXT></DOC>
