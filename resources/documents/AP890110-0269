The court, in an opinion by Justice Thurgood Marshall, said thetax does not interfere impermissibly with interstate commerce.   ``The tax at issue has many of the characteristics of a salestax,'' Marshall said. ``It is assessed on the individual consumer,collected by the retailer and accompanies the retail purchase of aninterstate telephone call.''   Two Illinois residents, Jerome F. Goldberg and Robert McTigue,challenged the tax in a class-action lawsuit filed four years ago inChicago. GTE Sprint Communications Corp. joined the case later,seeking to recover taxes already paid.   From Sept. 15, 1985 to July 1986, GTE Sprint paid $2.6 million intaxes under the challenged Illinois Telecommunications Excise Tax.   Lawyers for the National Conference of State Legislatures andother governmental groups told the justices that Illinois collects$10 million a month under the disputed phone tax.   The tax is assessed at a flat rate on all calls, intrastate andinterstate, charged to Illinois service addresses.   Writing for the court today, Marshall acknowledged that someinterstate telephone calls could be subject to multiple taxation ifsome other state also imposes a tax on them.   ``This limited possibility is not sufficient to invalidate theIllinois statutory scheme,'' Marshall said. ``To the extent thatother states' telecommunications taxes pose a risk of multipletaxation, the (Illinois law's) credit provision operates to avoidactual multiple taxation.''   Using a test the Supreme Court devised in 1977 to judge statetaxes challenged as unconstitutional, Marshall said the Illinois law``is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstatecommerce and is fairly related to services which the state ofIllinois provides to the taxpayer.''   The vote upholding the law was 9-0, but Justices John PaulStevens, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia did not joinMarshall's opinion in its entirety. The three wrote separateconcurring opinions.   The case is Goldberg vs. Sweet, 87-826.</TEXT></DOC>
