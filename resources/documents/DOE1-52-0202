<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-52-0202 </DOCNO><TEXT>Sulfur dioxide and acid rain trends are documented and mapped. The sizeand composition of particulate emissions are evaluated. The interactionsbetween particulates and sulfur-containing gases are identified as absorption-oxidationand direct catalytic oxidation of SO{sub 2} by particulates. Each ofthese reaction types is discussed in detail. The effect of particulateemission control devices on the formation of acid rain is discussed.The hypothesis advanced is that particulate removal may increase thenet formation of acid rain because the particulates are largely alkalineand function to neutralize the acidity caused by sulfur gases. 14 references,1 figure, 1 table.</TEXT></DOC>
