Under the agreement, Rolm -- owned by InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. and Germany's Siemens AG -- and MCIwill jointly market MCI's business services includingtoll-free 800 lines and sophisticated voice and data servicesto small-sized to medium-sized business customers that buy orcurrently use Rolm's office phone switches -- or PBXs.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts, however, doubt that the alliance will helpeither MCI or Rolm to add much to their respective shares ofthe long-distance services and PBX markets or even lead tosimilar arrangements between other carriers andmanufacturers.   Rolm's smaller business customers typically spend $80,000to $130,000 a month for long-distance phone service and tendto use one vendor, said James R. Long, Rolm senior vicepresident, marketing. &quot;We're trying to position Rolm as atotal solutions provider -- not just a PBX vendor,&quot; he said.In a pilot program, Rolm sales offices in Chicago and NewYork brought MCI more than $1 million in annual billings intwo months.   In return Rolm customers will get discounts of as much as26% off MCI rates, depending on the services they use.   &quot;This gets us access to the Rolm customer base, 80% ofwhich is not with MCI today,&quot; said Steven Zecola, vicepresident, business marketing, for MCI's Eastern Division. Hesaid the MCI-Rolm team had signed up &quot;more than a baker'sdozen&quot; customers in the past two weeks. He wouldn't discloseRolm's cut.   MCI and Rolm have been finding it increasingly difficultto compete against American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., whichhas stanched its market share losses to MCI. MCI hasresponded by authorizing other companies such as AmericanExpress Co. and Amway Corp. to sell its services. In PBXsATandamp;T is still the dominant force, though analysts estimate itis losing more than $100 million a year on the businessbecause of an industry price war.   &quot;ATandamp;T had put its equipment and services sales forcestogether and recently broke them apart because selling thetwo products didn't work,&quot; noted Jack B. Grubman, an analystat PaineWebber Inc.   &quot;Would you buy a Chrysler just because Chrysler is givingyou a discount on Getty gas?&quot; asked Joel D. Gross, ofDonaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. &quot;Some peoplemight, but how many?&quot;   Rolm's shipments in 1990 were flat in a $2.6 billionmarket that shrank almost 10% from the 1989 level, said KarenScherberger, an analyst at New York-based Northern BusinessInformation/Datapro. While &quot;MCI and Rolm may be trying tooffer smaller businesses something like ATandamp;T's Tariff 12service,&quot; which bundles equipment and service for bigcorporations, &quot;I don't see it giving Rolm much leverage in abid situation.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          AMERICAN TELEPHONE andamp; TELEGRAPH Co. is required by law tosell equipment and long-distance service under separatecontracts to the same customer. Thursday's editionincorrectly said ATandamp;T bundles some equipment and services forbig corporations.   (WSJ May 22, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
