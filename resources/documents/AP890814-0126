Most of the 16 Westernhostages in Lebanon, including eight Americans, are believed held bypro-Iranian kidnappers.   Tehran radio said Khamenei addressed these comments to U.S.leaders: ``Next to the usurper regime ruling over occupied Palestine(Israel), you are the most cursed government in the eyes of theIranian people. No one in the Islamic republic will hold talks withyou.''   He was speaking to relatives of prisoners of war held by Iraq andof soldiers missing in action in the 8-year war with Iraq, in whicha cease-fire was reached a year ago. The radio report was monitoredin Nicosia.   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati arrived in Damascus, Syria,Monday. When asked about the hostage situation, he said withoutelaboration: ``No negotiations before the release of Sheik AbdulKarim Obeid.''   Obeid is a Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped by Israeli commandosJuly 28 from his home in southern Lebanon. Israel has offered toexchange him for three Israeli soldiers captured in Lebanon and the16 Western hostages.   The differing viewpoints expressed by Khamenei and Velayatireflects the divisions in the Iranian leadership on whether to helparrange the release of the Western captives. Terry Andekson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press, has been heldthe longest. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Velayati said he was in Syria for talks on the situation inLebanon and had brought a letter to President Hafez Assad fromPresident Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran.   His remark on possible negotiations reflected a commentary Sundayby Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency outlining conditionsfor release of the hostages.   The agency said Iran would ``use its maximum influence for therelease of all the hostages'' if the United States freed $2 billionin Iranian assets. The assets were frozen 10 years ago afterIranians seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americanshostage for 444 days.   It also linked freedom for the hostages to the release of Obeid,who is affiliated with the Iranian-sponsored Hezbollah, or Party ofGod, and to settlement of Lebanon's 14-year-old sectarian civil war.   ``If the U.S. government really wants to solve the hostage issuein Lebanon and has no plot in mind, it should first put Israel underpressure to free Sheik Obeid at once,'' the commentary said.   ``Secondly it should present a comprehensive plan for the releaseof all the hostages, including the Iranian ones and the Lebanesecaptives held by Israel.''   Iran has long demanded the release of three Iranians missing inLebanon since 1982, who are believed to be dead.   IRNA said Iran would ask ``the oppressed Lebanese Moslems to takenew steps toward solving the hostage crisis'' provided release ofthe hostages would ``be a first step toward ... the return ofindependence to Lebanon and restoration of the rights of itsMoslems.''   President Bush said four days ago his administration wantedbetter relations with Iran but would not engage in ``trading off ornegotiating for hostages.''   Khamenei, usually considered a supporter of the those Iranianleaders known as pragmatists, did not specifically mention theWestern hostages, but said of the Obeid kidnapping: ``In Lebanon,America commits its greatest atrocities and encourages its puppetIsrael in kidnapping and hostage-taking.''   Khamenei was chosen as Iran's religious leader to succeedAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian revolutionary patriarch whodied June 3.   Rafsanjani, leader of the pragmatists, has indicated willingnessto negotiate with the United States. On Aug. 4, he said there were``reasonable, prudent solutions'' to the ``problem of freeing thehostages.''   Radicals in Tehran, led by Interior Minister Ali AkbarMohtashemi, have expressed opposition to any dealings withWashington.   Western intelligence officials say Mohtashemi was a founder ofHezbollah, believed to be an umbrella group for Shiite Moslem kidnapgangs in Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
