The dollar closed at 144.60 yen, up 0.70 yen from Wednesday's143.90-yen finish. It opened at 144.25 yen, and moved between143.70 yen and 144.65 yen.   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 444.73points, or 1.26 percent, to 34,795.34. It was this year'ssecond-largest one-day loss, following a 489.90-point decline June15, dealers said.   Many stock players sold issues in fear of another discount rateincrease, since Wednesday's increase seemed to have failed tosupport the yen, said Masaya Hashizume, a dealer with NikkoSecurities.   ``The most discouraging factor was the dollar's strength despitethe rate hike, not the hike itself,'' he said.   Investors sold issues, such as constructions, that they hadbought because of the yen's strength.   The Bank of Japan raised its official discount rate, the keylending rate charged commercial banks, by 0.5 percent to 3.75percent. The discount rate also affects other domestic interestrates, and discourages stock investment.   Satoshi Sumita, Bank of Japan's governor, told a news conferenceWednesday the central bank made the hike in consideration of recentflucutuations in exchange markets, domestic economic trends,consumer prices and the money supply.   In currency dealings, ``market players were still inclined tobuy the dollar because of the Greenspan comment Tuesday, which hada much stronger impact on the market than the Bank of Japan'sdiscount rate hike,'' Minori Takeuchi, a trader with Chemical Bankin Tokyo, said.   U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted toU.S. and Soviet officials in Moscow on Tuesday that the Fed wouldnot ease U.S. interest rates in the near term regardless of thecurrency's movements.   Citing the yen's weakness despite the discount rate hike,Takeuchi blamed the Greenspan comments for the worsening foreignexchange fluctuations.   A trader with the Bank of Tokyo said Wednesday, ``There is gooddemand for the dollar, though the market remains a bit nervous.''   Stock players were concerned whether the Federal Reserve Boardwould lower its official interest rates based on the U.S. wholesaleprice index for September, which is due Friday, the Bank of Tokyotrader said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Market analysts say a discount rate cut by the U.S. central bankwould be the best remedy to halt the dollar's excessive rise aftera series of discount rate hikes in Europe and Japan, in addition toconcerted central bank interventions.   Interest rate reductions tend to weaken the value of a currency.</TEXT></DOC>
