Tobacco companies have alwaysinsisted they don't, that tobacco ads don't make anyone startsmoking in the first place. But Canada's 18-month-old tobaccoad ban suggests otherwise, and could help tobacco opponentsin their fight to block the ads in the U.S.   Since Canada instituted the ban in January 1989, tobaccoconsumption, which had been declining, has slipped at an evensteeper rate. Since 1982, tobacco sales have fallen off 25%,with the steepest annual decline, nearly 7%, coming last yearalong with the ban. And the drop seems to be getting faster,with sales in the first four months of this year plunging by10%, according to tobacco executives and governmentofficials.</LP><TEXT>   To the ban's proponents, those figures are clear evidencethat the ad ban is making its mark. &quot;Smoking is a tough nutto crack, and we didn't think this was going to make it goaway overnight, but certainly all the signs are in the rightdirection,&quot; says Byron Rogers, an analyst with the tobaccoproducts section of Canada's Department of National Healthand Welfare in Ottawa.   Tobacco companies insist that advertising has nothing todo with the consumption decline. They blame big tax increaseson cigarettes put in place at the same time as the ban. Apack of smokes in Canada now costs as much as C$5 (US$4.25),more than a dollar more than before the ban, and double theprice just south of the border in the U.S. &quot;Obviously, it hasto do with taxes,&quot; says a spokesman for Imperial TobaccoLtd., Canada's largest tobacco company.   Adds a spokeswoman for RJR Macdonald, a Canadian unit ofRJR Nabisco, &quot;The minute the taxes increase, you can see thedecline in sales. It's such an instantaneous reaction, andadvertising doesn't work that way. Advertising is slow,methodical and cumulative.&quot;   The debate over tobacco advertising is being touched offanew as other countries move to restrict the ads. France'scabinet last week voted to ban all tobacco advertisingeffective Jan. 1, 1993. Australia and New Zealand both haveproposed severe restrictions. Italy, Portugal and most of theScandinavian countries already bar tobacco ads from bothtelevision and print media. In Canada, the ban is beingfought in the Quebec Superior Court in Montreal, where two ofthe country's major tobacco companies have challenged itsconstitutionality.   The problem on both sides of the debate is that it isvirtually impossible to isolate tobacco advertising's impact.Other factors are bound to get in the way, from taxes tohealth education. In Canada, the problem is compoundedbecause the ban is being phased in gradually; there hasn'tbeen a clean break from tobacco ads. Billboards have beenreduced but won't be banned until year end. In-storeadvertising won't be eliminated until 1993. Sportssponsorships won't be affected at all.   &quot;I wouldn't expect a big impact of the advertising ban inthe short run,&quot; says Richard W. Pollay, professor ofmarketing at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.&quot;In the long run, it affects starting rates and quittingrates, but that takes a new generation before you start tosee that.&quot;   Mr. Pollay and other academics, though, believe thattobacco ad bans are effective -- at least to some extent.Jeffrey Harris, an economics professor at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology, contends the tobacco companies'argument that stiff taxes are to blame for declines justdoesn't wash. Mr. Harris, who studied ad bans in othercountries, says cigarette consumption typically declinedfollowing ad bans and that &quot;the declines were bigger than youwould expect from taxes alone. Tax increases alone couldn'texplain it in any country.&quot;   The cigarette companies' other major argument is that theyuse ads only to persuade current smokers to switch brands,not to entice nonsmokers into a bad habit. &quot;Advertising isbasically to attract those who already smoke from one brandto another. It doesn't affect consumption,&quot; says a spokesmanfor Rothmans Benson andamp; Hedges in Toronto.   But Mr. Pollay, who studied cigarette company strategiesbefore testifying in favor of the ban, dismisses thatargument. &quot;The corporate documents are point blank thatthey're targeting youth and would-be quitters, what they callprequitters,&quot; he says. &quot;Most of the attention is to providereassurances to people who are anxious about their health,and to induce starters -- because in the long run, that's thename of the game.&quot;   In Canada, if the ad ban survives the constitutionalchallenge, the ultimate test of its effectiveness won't comefor another few years, when the country will be able tomeasure whether fewer people start smoking. So far, theresults are inconclusive. About 20% of 15- to 19-year-oldCanadians are regular smokers, about the same percentage ashas been true since the mid-1980s, says the Department ofNational Health's Mr. Rogers. &quot;Ultimately, we would like tosee more success in affecting starting smokers,&quot; he says. &quot;Westill have a problem.&quot;   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
