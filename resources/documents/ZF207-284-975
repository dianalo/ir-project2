(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>DEC Zeros In on Higher Education MarketandM;DEC's most recent thrust into the higher education market in an attempt togain a stronger foothold in academia, particularly at larger colleges whilehelping the company compete with IBM and other big campus rivals.andM;However, whether DEC's reach can match its vision remains debatable.andM;DEC's latest program, called the Education Initiative, will greatly lower oreliminate software licensing fees for qualifying higher educationinstitutions, according to company officials.andM;At least a year in the making, the plan, which was announced at the Cause '88conference last month in Nashville, also will drastically reduce the cost ofhardware service and support, company officials said.andP;  (See &quot;Hoping to ScoreCampus Coup, DEC Trims Fees, Support Costs,&quot; Digital Review, Dec. 5, 1988,page 1.)andM;For example, DEC expects hardware support costs to decline 75 to 78 percent,the result of cutrate parts and a larger role in maintenance on the part ofcolleges and universities.andM;In addition, DEC is providing more than 160 of its more popular softwareproducts free.andP;  Another 40 reduced-price program are offered under a CampusLibrary program, including applications such as programming languages.andM;Campus CompetitionandM;The initiative can be seen as a continuation of the company's philanthropytoward higher educational institutions.andP;  But it also highlights theincreasing competitiveness of the higher education marketplace.andM;In addition to IBM, other DEC competitors include Apple, Sun, Apollo,Hewlett-Packard and NeXT.andP;  The odds of the educational market supportingsubstantial growth for all these vendors seems slim at best.andM;The seeds of corporate computer purchases are often sown by students'exposure to a particular vendor in college--a fact not lost on DEC and othervendors.andP;  &quot;Education is a microcosm of the rest of the world of computing,&quot;said Roger Strickland, DEC's Education Group marketing manager.andM;Terry Shannon, director of the DEC Advisory Service of Framingham,Mass.-based market research company International Data Corp. (IDC), said,&quot;The more students who become accustomed to the Digital style of computing,the more converts they make before these people have to make businessdecisions on what systems to purchase.&quot;andM;Sales to educational institutions compose about 15 percent of VAX andMicroVAX sales, according to Computer Intelligence, a market research companyin La Jolla, Calif.andP;  The company estimates that DEC has 19,200 VAXesinstalled at educational sites.andM;Of the other minicomputer vendors, only Prime Computer, at 17 percent, had alarger percentage of its installed base bt educational sites.andM;In comparison, only about 4 percent of Data General MV series systems areinstalled at educational sites, according to Computer Intelligence, whileHewlett-Packard sold only 6 percent of its 3000 series to colleges anduniversities.andM;Obviously, a major goal of DEC's recent initiative is to continue increasingthe number of installed systems on U.S.andP;  campuses.andP;  &quot;We do expect some returnin the form of increased market share,&quot; DEC's Strickland said.andM;But DEC maintained that higher sales are only part of the story.andP;  Forginglong-term relationships and getting feedback are also key goals, Stricklandsaid.andM;&quot;We do expect a closer relationship with a lot of the leading researchinstitutions because of this,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Educational institutions have beenour best critics with a lot of products.&quot;andM;Strickland prefers to describe DEC's goal in education as forging&quot;partnerships&quot; rather than promoting discounting programs.andM;In fact, DEC officials hope that the universities and colleges will take moreof an active role in supporting the software.andM;For example, Strickland said the DEC hardware support program requiresuniversities to screen at least 80 percent of the universities' servicerequests and try to solve many of those hardware problems themselves.andM;&quot;We will provide you with all the toolkits so you can provide the same levelof service that DEC provides,&quot; he said.andP;  Under certain circumstances, headded, campus technicians will be able to attend DEC internal technicalcourses.andM;Even competitors concede that DEC is attacking the education market from aposition of strength, thanks to its large installed hardware base on campusesacross the country.andM;Industry watchers warned, however, that if DEC is to maintain its share ofhigher education business--let alone increase it--the company will need toface some significant rivals, including Apple and IBM.andM;DEC seems hesitant to name IBM as its biggest rival.andP;  Although Stricklandacknowledged that DEC needs to grab a larger share of the market, he was notspecific about which company could lose at the expense of DEC's gain.andM;DEC continues to battle Sun Microsystems on campus and elsewhere forworkstation sales.andP;  It remains to be seen if DEC's new workstationannouncements will have much of an immediate effect.andM;The introduction of powerful new workstations from NeXT of Palo Alto, Calif.,andO;presents yet another significant challenge for college and universitydollars.andP;  DEC officials, however, maintain that the Education Initiative wasnot influenced by NeXT computer.andM;&quot;Is [the Education Initiative] related to NeXT?andP;  No,&quot; DEC's Strickland said.andM;Nevertheless, he conceded that undermining the competition is among severalstrategic motives for expanding DEC's educational marketing programs.andP;  And,for DEC, virtually any computer system in any part of a college or universityis a competitor.andM;One of DEC's basic goals is to continue to be &quot;a campuswide supplier ofcomputing.&quot;andM;That strategy highlights one of several weak spots in DEC's higher educationprogram.andP;  The company generally is considered to be one of the two leadinghardware vendors to higher education, along with IBM, but it has not beenstrong across the board.andM;&quot;DEC doesn't have much of a position in [acade nic] research,&quot; said NatashaThompsen, an analyst with Link Resources, a New York research company.andM;&quot;We could be doing better, I'm sure,&quot; Strickland responded, pointing to pastgains in other academic areas.andP;  &quot;A couple of years ago, we didn't have muchof a presence in large universities in MIS, and now we are moving in,&quot; hepointed out.andM;New TargetsandM;He indicated that DEC intends to target other areas within the university inwhich the company does not have a high profile.andM;One way the company hopes to do that is through the Campus-wide SoftwareLicense Grant (CSLG), a part of the Education Initiative.andM;&quot;We are effectively licensing a campus installation for all our software thatis not royalty-based,&quot; Strickland said.andP;  DEC pays a royalty fee on somesoftware.andM;Another tactic is an older program, the Market Basket, which providescolleges with software for an average fee of 25 percent of U.S.andP;  listpricing.andM;DEC's newly aggressive educational marketing mirrors that of IBM, its biggestcompetitor in the higher education market.andM;Right now, IBM is promoting its own higher education marketing program.andO;Launched last June, IBM's Higher Education Software Consortium currentlyboasts more than 250 colleges and universities as customers.andP;  IBM chargeseach school a one-time fee based on how many faculty members it has.andP;  The IBMprogram is designed to provide different school departments with all of theirsoftware needs.andM;&quot;We're going after the whole package,&quot; said IBM consultant Charlotte Scott.andO;&quot;We are doing an awful lot in that market from top to bottom.&quot;andM;Last April, IBM also created a Campus Technology Centers program that grantsauthorized resellers status to more than 40 major colleges and universities,making the schools authorized IBM dealers.andM;The Armonk, N.Y., corporation also has its own ongoing campus supportprogram, called the Academic Information Systems Program (AISP).andP;  The programdiscounts software site-licensing fees by 14 percent and boastsproduct-development joint initiatives and a substantial grants program.andM;&quot;Depending on the size of the institution,&quot; Scott said, &quot;we will frequentlygive them the equipment way below cost or for no cost.&quot;andM;Such joint ventures are aimed at developing software for the educationalcommunity, as well as creating other programs IBM might choose to develop forits own.andM;Interestingly enough, DEC appears to be taking a complementary -- rather thandirectly competive -- approach to PC hardware vendors on campus, by workingto integrate PCs and VAX installations.andM;&quot;That's the whole strategy with respect to the lower end,&quot; Strickland said.andO;The key tactic is to convince educational institutions to go with DEC-stylepersonal computer integration, he said.andM;Judging by low sales of microcomputer products in education last year, DECand other vendor will have their work cut out for them.andM;According to the Software Publishers Association (SPA), a Washington-basedtrade association for microcomputer software firms, increases in educationalsoftware sales lagged well behined the rest of the industry in 1988.andM;Although overall PC software sales increased between 40 and 45 percent forthe year, according to SPA Executive Director Ken Wasch, sales to theeducational market rose only 18 percent for the same period.andP;  &quot;Schools havelimited budgets,&quot; he noted.andM;&quot;There's a tremendous amount of piracy taking place on campuses,&quot; he added.andO;&quot;No one should minimize the effect of that.&quot;andM;Wasch speculated that another rationale for DEC's relaxed software licensingprogram was to combat illegal software copying on campuses.andM;Nonetheless, industry observers said DEC's networking and communicationsstrengths give it a significant advantage.andM;Given the increasing importance of communication between workstations oncampus, DEC's position in networking utimately could prove to be crucialstrength in opening new doors.andM;&quot;DEC has a greater proportion of networking in education than in any otherindustry,&quot; DEC's Strickland asserted.andM;IDC's Shannon noted that &quot;[DEC] can sell server systems that will unify othervendors hardware.andP;  So can HP.andP;  But DEC currently has the best serveroffering, and that's the best way to own the network.&quot;andM;DEC's networking focus--as well as the competitive nature of that arena--wasrecently highlighted by an announcement from Carnegie-Mellon University.andM;The Pittsburgh-based institution is bringing in DEC to participate in theuniversity's &quot;Andrew&quot; network--ironically funded mostly by IBM--which linksmore than 50 separate local area networks.andM;&quot;Over the past seven years, we have received more funding from DEC than IBM,&quot;said James H. Morris, Carnegie-Mellon professor of computer science anddirector of the university's Information Technology Center.andP;  Most expect thatthe alliance will continue.andM;The battle for campus business also has created some interesting networks ofanother sort--three-way partnerships that target specific institutions.andM;DEC, for example, has allied itself with Kodak in program at the Universityof Rochester.andP;  And, in a case of strange--and like wary--bedfellows, DEC andIBM are working together on Project Athena with the Massachusetts Instituteof Technology in Cambridge, Mass.andM;One of Project Athena's goals is, not too surprisingly, to network dissimilarhardware.andP;  &quot;Both DEC and IBM realize that they are going to have to coexistwith each other,&quot; IDC's Shannon noted.andM;Still, no one expects a friendly coexistence.andP;  DEC, in particular, has beenbusy of late recruiting third-party allies.andM;In recent months, DEC has signed educationally oriented System CooperativeMarketing Partner (SCMP) agreements with Campus America, based in Knoxville,Tenn., for its Poise database management system (DBMS) product, and Quodata,headquartered in Hartford, Conn., for information management of software.andM;Coinciding with DEC's increased interest in the education market arethird-party software vendors' stepping up their activities in that arena.andM;Computer Associates of Garden City, N.Y., for example, in September beganoffering a spreadsheet trade-in promotion for teachers, students and schools.andM;Informix of Menlo Park, Calif., in November announced SmartWare for theeducation community.andP;  It is an integrated business productivity package thatincludes spreadsheet and graphics capabilities.andM;DEC's Strickland estimated that more than 50 third-party vendors are nowallied with DEC in the educational market, including at least at 10 partnersin administrative software.andM;Depending on which direction DEC takes, however, not all of those partnerswill be strategically positioned to support a push for an expanded campuspresence.andM;Quodata, for example, has been a long-time DEC supporter, primarily becauseof DEC's strength on smaller campuses, according to Quodata spokeswomanBarbara Andrews.andP;  &quot;We're not a large state university vendor,&quot; she said.andM;Quodata's administrative systems--ranging from admissions packages tofinancial aid and bursars' office systems--are geared primarily to campuseswith enrollments in the 2,000-to-4,000 range.andP;  If DEC elects to concentrateon large universities, companies like Quodata will have to reconsider theirfocus.andM;&quot;Can [Quodata] handle colleges of 100,000?andP;  No.&quot; Andrews said.andP;  &quot;It mightmean we could go up to [colleges with] 8,000 to 10,000.&quot; Still, she pointedout, the SCMP agreement can benefit the company only in the higher eductionmarket.andM;&quot;It it the closest bond Digital can make between itself and a third party.andO;[DEC's] sales people will rech for the brochure of an SCMP before [one from]an authorized distributor.&quot;andM;It is not yet clear how big a market increase DEC can expect from theEducation Initiative, even with expanded third-party support.andP;  Some industrywatchers have modest hopes.andM;&quot;If an educational institution was wavering between IBM and DEC, it mightmake a difference,&quot; Shannon said.andP;  &quot;But, in the grand scheme of things, Idon't think it's going to radically increase the number of users that will beexposed to DEC hardware and software,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;I don't think it will have a tremendous impact,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;But it's safe toassume that the Initiative will give DEC more competitive leverage thanbefore.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
