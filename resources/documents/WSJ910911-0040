The board of the RTC, the savings-and-loan cleanup agency,approved the transaction yesterday in a closed meeting. Thedeal is still subject to the execution of a sales contract.The agency official said that the transaction won't be finalfor several days.</LP><TEXT>   The terms call for the investors to pay $527 million forthe loans, or 48% of the value that the Sandamp;Ls carried theloans on their books. They were one of five bidding groups.The RTC valued the package at $725 million.   The loan sale is part of the savings-and-loan cleanupagency's efforts to sell its assets in bulk packages.   A spokesman for the Robert Bass Group couldn't immediatelybe reached for comment yesterday.   Jeffrey Rutishauser, manager of business development forGE Capital, a subsidiary of General Electric Co., said in aninterview that he wouldn't comment on the company's plans forits RTC acquisitions but that GE Capital has been interestedin RTC assets for some time. &quot;The large bulk sales are justgetting going,&quot; he said. &quot;It's the right approach.&quot;   Neither GE Capital nor Bass are strangers to thesavings-and-loan cleanup. GE Capital has another largetransaction in the works to acquire $500 million incommercial properties from the agency, and previously itacquired $800 million in auto loans. The Robert Bass Groupacquired a failed savings and loan from the now-defunctFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. in 1988 in one ofthe roughly 200 sales that included big tax breaks.   Those 1988 transactions have been criticized on CapitolHill for being far too generous to investors. The RTC isrenegotiating many of those transactions, including the Bassacquisition of the thrift now known as New West FederalSavings and Loan, Stockton, Calif.   Loans on apartments comprise about 70% of the Californiaand Arizona portfolio, with the remainder in retail,commercial or office space. All are either &quot;subperforming&quot; or&quot;nonperforming,&quot; which means that the loans are either payinglate or that the collateral value has declined. Buyersgenerally acquire such loans either to try to foreclose onthe real estate or to restructure the loans. A small amountof the property is in several other Western states.   Security Pacific Corp. acted as adviser to the RTC on thetransaction.   In an unrelated action, federal banking regulators doubledthe threshold for requiring real estate appraisals totransactions larger than $100,000.   Banks have complained that the previous threshold of$50,000 has proven costly and time-consuming. They alsoargued that the smaller deals haven't caused substantiallosses to banks, according to officials of the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp.   The requirement for appraisals on transactions larger than$50,000 was mandated in the savings-and-loan cleanup law.   The FDIC said it received more than 200 comments on the$50,000 threshold since it was implemented a year ago. Mostof the letters recommended that the threshold be raised to$100,000. The Comptroller of the Currency also recentlyproposed raising the appraisal threshold to $100,000.</TEXT></DOC>
