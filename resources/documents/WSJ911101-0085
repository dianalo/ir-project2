Determined to go into every community, no matter how whiteor redneck, the candidate for lieutenant governor one dayvisited the rural Eastern Shore district of state Sen.William Fears. &quot;It was hard at first,&quot; Mr. Fears says. &quot;Oneman came up and said to me, `There's all kinds running thisyear, ain't there?' But he captivated them.&quot; On election day,Mr. Wilder won -- capturing a startling 44% of the whitevote.   Four years later, Mr. Wilder prepared for the next logicalstep, a campaign for governor -- and had to face the samedoubts all over again. &quot;I told him, `You're not going towin,'&quot; his friend Sen. Fears says. &quot;`Virginia is a raciallyprejudiced state. You're going to get your heart broken.'&quot;Instead, Lawrence Douglas Wilder made U.S. history, becomingthe nation's first black elected governor.   To Virginians proud of the evidence of their progress, Mr.Wilder would recall his late mother telling him, &quot; `Don't letyour head get too big, because you know you didn't get thereby yourself.' And God knows I didn't.&quot;   In truth, Gov. Wilder believes he did get where he is byhimself. And therein lies the root of both his stunningpolitical success and its darker side, a reputation as one ofthe most contentious figures in politics today. He's a manwho doesn't just enjoy combat but seems to seek it out. Evenas he sits at the top of Virginia's establishment and reachesfor the Democratic presidential nomination, he remains theoutsider -- ever ready to do battle with the real orperceived forces holding him down.   His rise is all the more extraordinary for taking place inVirginia -- the state that sold his grandfather into slaveryapart from wife and children, charged his father a poll taxto vote and paid young Doug Wilder to go out of state ratherthan open its own colleges to a black man, even one who hadbeen decorated for bravery in Korea.   Yet each rung on his climb had to be scaled despite theopen skepticism of friends like Bill Fears and, more galling,the private naysaying and counterplotting -- stoutly deniedin public -- of Virginia's establishment Democrats, from U.S.Sen. Charles Robb on down.   &quot;That's a hell of a thing when your own party's meeting insecret because they say you'll bring down the whole ticket,&quot;says Paul Goldman, one of Gov. Wilder's two closestconfidants and now the state Democratic Party chairman. &quot;Idon't know how he stood it.&quot;   Douglas Wilder stood it because of who he is, a uniquelyAmerican mix of Horatio Alger hero and Ralph Ellison's&quot;Invisible Man,&quot; a mix that today is reflected in a politicalideology that uneasily combines fiscal conservatism andsocial liberalism.   As Mr. Wilder's bid for the presidency now illustratesmost dramatically, he has the unassailable self-confidenceand ambitions of the son whose parents insisted he could beanything if educated. But he's also the product of thedebasing system of segregation in which he grew up, and ofthe more subtle racism that survived it. Even as hecelebrated his 1985 election at Richmond's John MarshallHotel, he was recalling the days when it was all white and hewas a young waiter, pouring coffee for Virginia's elite,answering to &quot;boy,&quot; and once even musing about poisoning thesalads.   &quot;Is he wrong to remember the injustices that may have beendone to him along the way?&quot; asks an older sister, OlgaGraves.   His long-simmering feud with Sen. Robb -- includingeavesdropping by a Robb ally on a phone call in which Gov.Wilder said Sen. Robb was &quot;finished&quot; because of questionsabout his personal life -- is just the best-known example ofhis public spats. There are others, fights more clearly ofhis own fanning, compelled less by resentment of the whiteestablishment's slights than by simple power politics.   When a former press secretary this year said he should paymore attention to Virginia, anonymous reports surfaced in thepress suggesting that she was fired for racism andanti-Semitism. After state Sen. Benjamin Lambert, Mr.Wilder's first campaign manager, opposed him on some budgetvotes, the governor briefly backed a political map that wouldhave pitted Mr. Lambert against another black leader -- HenryMarsh, a former college roommate and later a rival of Mr.Wilder.   &quot;It was a power play,&quot; says Sen. Lambert. &quot;The governorgets a little excited when things aren't going his way.That's why you don't turn your back.&quot;   Trying to fathom Doug Wilder has long been something of asport in Virginia. Yet he almost boasts, &quot;There are very fewpeople who know me.&quot; And probably very few can know himwithout having known the segregated Richmond into which hewas born 60 years ago.   The all-black Church Hill neighborhood of his youth is ashort ride from the antebellum governor's mansion. But he putthe distance into perspective when the Wilder family held areunion on the adjoining Capitol grounds, recalls the Rev.Robert Taylor, who'd been pastor of the Fourth Baptist Churchacross from the Wilder home: &quot;He said he remembered a timewhen squirrels were more welcome there than black people.&quot;   The ninth of Robert and Beulah Wilder's 10 children,Douglas Wilder was pampered by his vigilant mother. Educationwas stressed, even at play: Word games like Scrabble werefamily entertainment. Good grades were expected, and so wasgood behavior. Errant behavior was met with a peach-treeswitch.   The family was much admired. Robert Wilder had awhite-collar job in a black-owned insurance firm. Thewell-kept house at 28th and P Streets was a magnet for otherchildren. Built on the site that grandparents James and AgnesWilder had chosen after gaining freedom, it includedhand-hewn boards salvaged from the ex-slaves' original home.   Segregation was an accepted, in some ways distant, fact oflife within the self-contained community. So, for many blacks-- including Mr. Wilder -- the first brush with segregationwas on the streetcars. &quot;We were at the end of the line,&quot; hesays, &quot;so going into town the car would be empty and I'd sitdown and my mother would say, `You can't sit there. Let'smove to the back.'&quot;   At Virginia Union University in Richmond, Mr. Wilderpartied with his fraternity and studied to be a dentist.Applying to the state for a job after graduation in 1951, hewas offered one -- as a cook.   Drafted into the Korean War, he tried to avoid combat butwon a Bronze Star for capturing a group of prisoners underfire. (Over Mr. Wilder's protests, the honor became a key tothe 1985 campaign, thanks to his manager, Mr. Goldman. &quot;Thereal heroes never made it back,&quot; Mr. Wilder says.) Back inVirginia after the war, though, the Bronze Star meant nothingwhen Mr. Wilder decided to attend law school; the stateactually paid him to go somewhere else. He ultimately choseHoward University in Washington, D.C.   Years later, Gov. Wilder told Bennie Harris, a Howardclassmate, of addressing his daughter's graduating class atthe University of Virginia, and recalling his own exclusion.Mr. Harris, who had also been paid by his home state ofAlabama to get educated elsewhere, heard a common chord inhis friend's account: &quot;You're just so bitter, so much so thatyou can never forget it.&quot;   Many black people, faced with similar situations, joinedthe civil-rights movement. Mr. Wilder -- two years youngerthan Martin Luther King, and who first met Jesse Jackson at a1962 fraternity convention -- largely kept away from it.Throughout the 1960s, married and with three children, hebuilt a lucrative law practice. (He was divorced in 1979;court records of the bitter case are sealed.) &quot;Black lawyersat that time didn't have a reputation for being good at allfields,&quot; he says. &quot;They could be good for civil-rights cases,or drawing up a will or a deed, and that's it. I wanted toset my own agenda.&quot;   He approached his political career the same way. In 1969,he bucked Richmond's leading black group, the Crusade forVoters, and was elected the state Senate's only black member.&quot;I wasn't the choice of anybody,&quot; he says. &quot;Black groupsquestioned whether I had paid my dues.&quot; The tension exists tothe present. &quot;If you were a fly on the wall at Crusademeetings, you'd hear the real feelings expressed,&quot; sayslawyer Sa'ad El-Amin, a Richmond activist and longtime Wildercritic. But out of pride for Mr. Wilder's achievements, hesays, most black leaders remain publicly silent.   Sen. Wilder was best known for two initiatives: a futileone to repeal the racist state song, &quot;Carry Me Back to OldVirginny,&quot; and a prolonged, triumphant push for a holidayhonoring Martin Luther King. Republicans later would try topaint him a liberal, but generally he was a centrist. &quot;Hedidn't have far to go to tailor his record for statewideraces,&quot; says state Sen. Joseph Gartlan. Mr. Wilder did becomepro-death penalty, though he and Sen. Gartlan had formed thelonely opposition in the 1970s.   As a senator, he also worked well with the Legislature'sconservative leaders, the Old Guard survivors ofsegregationist Harry Flood Byrd's machine. &quot;He knew who hehad to make peace with to get ahead,&quot; says Ruby Martin, alaw-school classmate now in the Wilder cabinet; he would evencampaign for Old Guard legislators among their blackconstituents.   Yet in 1982, when the Democrats' consensus U.S. Senatecandidate invoked the Byrd legacy in a speech, Mr. Wilder byhis protests ultimately forced the candidate to withdraw. Hehad played the race card: Cross me, and risk losing blackvotes.   In 1985, and again in 1989, reluctant party leadersultimately closed ranks rather than cross Mr. Wilder. Yet thereturns were hardly in before the squabbling resumed. Aslieutenant governor, Mr. Wilder blasted Gov. Gerald Baliles'stransportation plan because of its sales-tax increase, afterhe had been involved in its evolution. He opposed legislationfrom Attorney General Mary Sue Terry, then a potential rivalfor governor. And in 1986, the feud with Mr. Robb went publicwith the leak of two letters in which Mr. Robb objected toallegations from the Wilder camp that he had been unjustlytaking credit for the Wilder victory. &quot;Friends don't treatfriends like you've treated me and those closest to me,&quot; Mr.Robb wrote.   As governor, Mr. Wilder tweaked ex-Gov. Baliles forleaving a budget deficit. Since then, he's tried to turn thebudget-balancing act to advantage, by burnishing an image asa fiscal conservative. &quot;He sounded more like a Republicanthan a Republican,&quot; says GOP state Sen. Robert Calhoun. Butthe austerity has left campaign promises back home, such asteachers' raises, unfulfilled.   And the budget cutting and feuding have left the governor,who by law can't succeed himself, with a record-low 30%approval rating. So, as he campaigns to restore Virginia'sreputation as &quot;the mother of presidents,&quot; it seems he will doso as something less than a favorite son.</TEXT></DOC>
