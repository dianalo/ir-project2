The workers, who walked off their jobs at 6 a.m., asked for a 100percent pay increase, according to the Tanjug news agency andsources in Ljubljana, capital of the northern republic of Slovenia.   The average salary of the striking workers, mostly enginedrivers, is $200 a month _ about twice the national average.   The walkout briefly paralyzed several railroad lines beforeengine drivers from other towns replaced the striking workers of thestate-run Ljubljana railway, Tanjug said. A strike committee issueda warning that Slovenian rail safety could be jeopardized becausethe trains were being driven by unskilled personnel.   It was not clear when the strikerswould return to work.   The strikers said Mikulic, who leads the federal government inBelgrade, is responsible for the ``catastrophic'' financialsituation of the country's railroad companies, Tanjug reportedwithout elaborating.
