The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 3-0 rulingWednesday, said the practice violates the constitutional ban onunreasonable searches.   ``The intrusiveness of a body-cavity search cannot beoverstated,'' Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall said in upholding $25,000in damages to a woman searched after her arrest on her roommate'saccusation of grand theft.   Noting that felonies in California include willful tax evasionand securities fraud, the court said the felony designation haslittle to do with the likelihood of a suspect's concealing drugs,weapons or other contraband.   Police offered no evidence that people arrested on suspicion ofa felony were more likely than other inmates to smuggle illegalitems into jail, the court said.   ``A ham-handed approach to policy-making runs the serious riskof infringing upon detainees' constitutional rights,'' said Hall, aconservative appointed to the court by President Reagan.   ``Strip searches involving the visual exploration of bodycavities (are) dehumanizing and humiliating,'' Hall said.   The court, however, said it was not deciding if strip searchesin all felony cases, without inspection of body cavities, wereconstitutional.   No decision has been made on an appeal, said Los AngelesAssistant City Attorney Richard Helgeson, who said he wasdisappointed by the ruling.   But Alva Cooper, lobbyist for the California Peace OfficersAssociation, said the ruling ``would have to be appealed to theSupreme Court.''   The general rule in California is that those arrested andconfined for more than a few hours are searched for drugs, Coopersaid.   ``If someone can tell us how we keep narcotics out of jail(without a body-cavity search), we'd be only too glad to do that.No one likes cavity searches, but at the present time there's noother way,'' Cooper said.</TEXT></DOC>
