Deutsche Bank, West Germany's largest bank, said it agreed to temporarily transfer to the Spanish central bank one-fourth of the 39.05% stake it has accumulated in Bancotrans. But it said it received assurances from the central bank that it could subsequently win permission to complete its acquisition of Bancotrans.    The transfer agreement followed allegations that Deutsche Bank and another West German bank were conspiring to skirt Spanish restrictions against a foreign bank's acquiring more than 50% of a Spanish bank without central-bank approval.    Baden-Wuerttembergischen Bank AG, in which Deutsche Bank indirectly holds a minority interest, recently acquired a 10% stake in Bancotrans. Deutsche Bank said that &quot;public misunderstandings&quot; in Spain were stirred by reports that the smaller German bank had in fact acquired a stake of more than 11%, giving the two German banks a combined majority. </TEXT></DOC>
