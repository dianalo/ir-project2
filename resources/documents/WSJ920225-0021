But Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. came throughunscathed, even benefiting from the plight of others.   This week, it reported a 14% increase for the year intotal capital to $6.3 billion, which is the best way ofmeasuring earnings at mutual life insurers like Metropolitan.Sales for all lines of business to individuals rose by almost40% in 1991 as consumers were drawn, like June bugs to aporch light, to insurers with triple-A ratings such asMetropolitan.</LP><TEXT>   What's more, Metropolitan recently added nearly $2 billionin assets, bringing its total to $144 billion, by taking overthe businesses of troubled insurers. These included theannuity business of Executive Life Insurance Co. of New York,which was seized by regulators last summer, and part of thepension business of Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York,which hit financial straits last year.   &quot;It's a unique situation for us now,&quot; says Harry P. Kamen,one of four senior executive vice presidents. &quot;We've gotmomentum,&quot; says Mr. Kamen. &quot;{Troubled insurers} come to us;they're knocking on our door. And, as good neighbors, we say,`Sure, we'll see if we've got a cup of sugar for you.'&quot;   Indeed, analysts say Metropolitan is to the insuranceindustry what J.P. Morgan is to the banking industry. &quot;Theyare one of the few companies in the position of playing aleading role in the industry,&quot; says Martin Weiss, of WeissAssociates, a Palm Beach, Fla., insurance rating concern.   Unlike some of its competitors, Metropolitan avoided thetemptation of investing heavily in risky assets like junkbonds and real estate in order to lure policyholders withhigh interest rates. &quot;There were people out there offeringhigher rates. But we were willing to live through thisperiod, because investment quality is important to us,&quot; saidRobert E. Chappell Jr., senior executive vice president.   The acquisitions were a boon for Metropolitan in more waysthan one. The insurer picked up a sizable amount of businesscheaply, since both transactions involved a transfer ofbusiness to Metropolitan for a small price tag. (In the caseof ELNY, for example, the price will amount to as little as$70 million, equal to the commissions it would have paidagents for the new business.)   Even more important, Metropolitan picked up the newbusiness without taking on any new risks with it. &quot;They arereally very shrewd,&quot; says John Kleiman, an analyst withConning andamp; Co. in Hartford, Conn. &quot;There is not much risk inthese deals on their part.&quot;   But the two transactions have raised questions in theminds of some industry pros about whether the deals weredisadvantageous to some policyholders of MONY and ELNY. Inthe case of ELNY, some former customers remain underregulator control, and Metropolitan is &quot;taking the goodassets and leaving the government holding the bad ones,&quot; saysMr. Weiss.   What's more, some analysts are now wondering whether theadditional business might eventually cost Metropolitan itstriple-A rating. Some say a wiser strategy for Met would havebeen to allow its capital ratio to increase even more,especially since rating concerns are more closely watchingthe industry. Making Metropolitan's management even edgierwas the recent downgrading of the nation's largest insurerand Met's age-old rival, Prudential Insurance Co. of America,which lost its triple-A rating in January.   An even more pressing issue in coming years forMetropolitan, run by the team of four senior executive vicepresidents, will be keeping down expenses, according toRobert G. Schwartz, chairman and chief executive officer, whoplans to retire next year. Besides Mr. Kamen and Mr.Chappell, the senior executive vice presidents in the runningfor the insurer's top spot are Ted Athanassiades and StewartG. Nagler.   Indeed, expenses for 1990 in its life insurance business,including commissions for agents, totaled $1.2 billion atMetropolitan, which still serves 6,000 employees a free lunchat its massive headquarters in midtown Manhattan. As apercentage of premiums, that's nine percentage points abovethe industry average of 29%. With criticism of the highexpense levels at mutual insurers increasing, the issue is asensitive one at Metropolitan.   &quot;Controlling expenses and increasing efficiency will be anongoing challenge for us,&quot; Mr. Schwartz says. Last year, thecompany put in place a policy of holding expenses for theforeseeable future at the level of 1990. That will likelylead to staff reductions, however. In 1991, the companyoffered 1,000 employees voluntary separation packages. Theinsurer's free lunch may even be discontinued.   The industry's troubles have not left Metropolitancompletely untouched. For example its guaranteed investmentcontract business -- a type of annuity sold to pension funds-- increased only 4% in 1991 to $6.7 billion.   &quot;We're just treading water in that area,&quot; said Mr.Athanassiades. Some areas of its GIC business, in particularits so-called traditional GICs, have actually been shrinkingfaster than the industry.   The development is especially surprising since pensionmanagers are widely thought to be transferring their businessto triple-A companies. But, according to Mr. Athanassiades,most of Metropolitan's GIC contracts are large ones held bybig companies. Those customers, he says, are substitutingGICs for other products, such as mutual funds.   Metropolitan has turned down most merger proposals. Mergertalks began this summer with Mutual of New York, whosepolicyholders began panicking this summer after real estatetroubles led to a sharp downgrading. But instead of mergingthe two companies, which would have left Metropolitan with alarge increase in sour real estate loans, Metropolitan agreedto take over the contracts of many of the pension customersof MONY, the group of customers most worried about theinsurer's financial health.   Part of the agreement between the two insurers, however,was that Metropolitan would not take on any of MONY'stroubled real estate as part of the transaction. To furtherprotect itself, Metropolitan segregated the assets backingthe pension business from its own.   The end result left pension customers, rather thanMetropolitan, to absorb the losses should any of the assetsin the pool turn sour. The transactions' subtleties were notlost on pension customers, however. Only one-third of thoseoffered the deal transferred their business to Met.   Similar criticisms were made of Metropolitan's transactionwith ELNY, which allowed Metropolitan to avoid taking on anyof ELNY's junk-bond portfolio. Instead, Metropolitan received$1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents.   Mr. Chappell shrugs off such complaints, however. &quot;We'renot willing to be the savior of the industry at the expenseof our own strength,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
