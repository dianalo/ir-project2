Ticket agents reported a surge in sales at Eastern competitors asa strike appeared increasingly likely at the Miami-based airline,which carries an average of 100,000 passengers a day and says it islosing $1 million daily.   Eastern wants to cut salaries to save $150 million. TheMachinists union, representing 8,500 Eastern baggage handlers andother ground services workers, wants $50 million in salary increases.   Company Chairman Frank Lorenzo, in a videotape sent Wednesday tothe pilots union, warned that ``if the pilots and other employeessupport the (machinists') picket line and don't show up for work,Eastern cannot survive.''   ``I'm afraid Eastern is going to go through this juncture andperhaps end up in the corporate graveyard,'' said Lorenzo, thechairman of Texas Air, Eastern's parent company.   Eastern's rivals also have been mapping strategy to keepoperating in the event of a secondary boycott by the Machinistsunion, which has asked a federal court judge in Washington to allowits members to picket other airlines, ships and other modes oftransportation.   While most airlines aren't commenting on contingency plans in theevent of an industry-wide strike, some of Eastern's fiercestcompetitors are moving to cash in on the passenger spillover.   Pan American Corp., which vies with Eastern in the lucrative EastCoast shuttle routes, already has said it would double its flightslinking New York to Boston and Washington during a strike.   And Delta said it can handle Eastern's surplus to Florida andPuerto Rico without putting more planes in the air.   Non-union Continental Airlines, also owned by Texas Air, hasdownplayed the effect of a strike at Eastern despite vows byMachinists union members to close it down as well.   ``We are two totally separate carriers,'' said Continentalspokesman Ned Walker in Houston. ``We do not expect any impact atContinental from the Eastern situation. ... There will be no servicedisruption whatsoever.''   Eastern says it is doomed unless its pilots continue flyingduring a strike, set to begin at 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday unless anagreement is reached in the machinists' 17-month-old contractdispute.   Lorenzo's videotaped message offered pilots sweeter pay raisesand job security, but leaders of the pilots and flight attendantsunions have urged members to honor picket lines.   Lorenzo, who bought Eastern in 1986, earned a union-bustingreputation when he broke labor contracts with Continental's workersafter taking that airline into bankruptcy reorganization in 1983.   The 3,500-member pilots union said the new offer does notguarantee job security, contains $64 million in pilot concessionsand would require the union to drop lawsuits and grievances worth$250 million.   ``In his videotape, Mr. Lorenzo made a fine theatricalperformance,'' the pilots executive council said in a statement toits members. ``Don't be misled. Much work still needs to be done.''   The Machinists also appealed for solidarity in the days beforethe strike.   ``We would hope the pilots would remember that Lorenzo has madeagreements before and contracts mean nothing to him. He's not to betrusted,'' said Frank Ortis, vice president of the Machinists Miamilocal.   The White House, meanwhile, is giving no hint of whetherPresident Bush will meet the request of federal mediators and stop astrike. White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush willmake his decision on whether to step in before the midnight Fridaydeadline.   As to a proposal to stop the strike for 60 days, ``No decisionhas been made,'' Fitzwater said today.   Eastern ran full-page advertisements in some newspapers today,quoting editorials across the country that urge Bush not to call infederal mediators.   Eastern has promised passengers full refunds or seats on otherairlines at no extra cost if flights are canceled, but severalcompetitors remain wary of accepting tickets a bankrupt Easternmight not be able to pay for.</TEXT></DOC>
