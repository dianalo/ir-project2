SalwenStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> JAPAN FREST CANDA EUROPMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The dollar slumped to post-World War II lows against the Japanese yen and West German mark yesterday before rebounding in extremely thin U.S. trading to end the session only slightly lower.    Bearish sentiment continues to pervade the market, traders said, but many participants were wary of taking short, or oversold, positions because of the market's lack of depth.    &quot;In thin trading, you can get caught in a short-covering rally that can be really painful,&quot; Tim Scala, trading manager at Manufacturers andamp; Traders Trust Co., New York, said.    The dollar slipped to a postwar low of 127.45 yen in European trading. Dealers said it was weakened by sizable sell orders from Japanese exporters and from the Soviet Union.    Shigeru Tokunaga, vice president and foreign exchange manager in New York for Japan's Fuji Bank Ltd., said Japanese exporters who failed to sell dollars quickly enough during the U.S. currency's decline the previous few days had to come back into the market yesterday to convert their dollars to yen.    The Bank of Japan reportedly intervened in Tokyo trading to support the dollar after it slipped below 128 yen. Traders estimated that the Japanese central bank bought $300 million to $400 million to try to halt the dollar's fall.    In a speech in Tokyo, former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker implied that the dollar may have fallen too far, increasing the danger of U.S. inflation. There has been &quot;an overemphasis on exchange rates as part of the adjustment process,&quot; he said.    Although the statement had little effect on the foreign exchange market, traders said, the dollar strengthened after the White House responded to Mr. Volcker's comments. Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater restated Reagan administration policy, saying, &quot;We are not seeking a decline in the dollar.&quot; Shortly after that, the dollar recovered to 127.93 yen in late New York trading but was still down from 128.35 yen late Friday.    The currency was quoted at 128.05 yen in early Tokyo trading Tuesday.    In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 127.75 yen, up from an early low of 127.65.    The dollar also slipped as low as 1.6225 marks early in the U.S. trading day yesterday. After the White House statement, it was up to 1.6307 marks in late New York trading, compared with 1.6313 late Friday.    Traders said the continued bearishness is a result of Washington's failure so far to complete work on measures to cut the U.S. budget deficit.    &quot;If we're looking for any improvement at this stage of the game, it has to be out of the budget,&quot; Mark Pletscher, assistant manager of the central order desk for BankAmerica International in New York, said. &quot;Washington needs to change the focus of the market.&quot;    Mr. Pletscher said that only trader wariness about the thin market restrained the dollar from falling further. &quot;The only reason this won't go through 1.60 marks is just lack of interest,&quot; he said.    Mr. Scala of Manufacturers andamp; Traders Trust agreed. &quot;There's no comfort level here that (President) Reagan can get a grip on the problem,&quot; he said. &quot;We need very strong leaders in the House, Senate and administration. There appears to be an absence of all three.&quot;    Mr. Scala said any gains by the dollar now are largely viewed by the market as a selling opportunity. He said he expects the currency to slip to 125 yen and 1.60 marks by year end.    But James P. Chorek, assistant vice president and technical analyst at Money Market Services Inc., Chicago, projected a temporary rally in the dollar over about the next month. He said the currency should reach 1.71 or 1.72 marks by mid-January, based on technical factors.    &quot;Although the dollar has reached new lows, the momentum has slowed,&quot; Mr. Chorek said. &quot;That's a bullish factor.&quot; But after the one-month climb, he said, he expects the dollar to resume its trend to new postwar lows.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery slipped $1.60 an ounce to $495.50 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was four million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $493.45 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                   Late New York Trading                   Monday, Dec. 14, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
