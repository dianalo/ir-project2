Thecontrast medium injected into the right atrium was used as indicator.During and after the injection of contrast medium one blood sample persecond was obtained through a catheter placed in the descending aorta.The samples were analyzed for iodine content with X-ray fluorescenceanalysis and cardiac output determined ad modum Stewart-Hamilton. Thermodilutionwas used as a reference method. The results indicate that the indicatordilution method with the use of contrast medium might be used for calibrationof videodensitometric methods for blood flow measurements.</TEXT></DOC>
