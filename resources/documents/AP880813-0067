GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Shops in Burma reopened today andstreets filled with people cheering the resignation of hard-lineleader Sein Lwin, but some skirmishes were reported near Rangoon,travelers and news reports said.   ``Burma's Hitler was brought down by the might of all thepeople,'' Japan's Kyodo News Agency quoted one Burmese as saying.``It was late in coming but it's only natural that the mostunpopular person is overthrown,'' said another.   Brett B. Lambert, an American student returning from Rangoon,said posters on walls of the capital showed Sein Lwin with bloodflowing from his mouth, a skull and crossbones around his face, and``massacre'' written beneath.   He said there were more cars on the streets today and shopsopened their doors to streams of customers. ``People are smilingand happy,'' Lambert said.   Western diplomats contacted in Rangoon said downtown areas werequiet.   ``We're in a kind of wait and see mode. The Burmese are veryrelieved that Sein Lwin stepped down but basically skeptical aboutwhat it all means,'' one of diplomat said. ``Is this cosmetic or isit a real concession to the demonstrators?'' The diplomats spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Kyodo said troops had withdrawn from the city and tensions easedafter four days of anti-government protests that left at least 95people dead. Western diplomats said hundreds may have died in thefighting, and unconfirmed reports said up to 1,000 were killedduring the disturbances. Rangoon, a city of 3.5 million, had beenunder a daytime curfew since Tuesday.   Peter Swan, an Australian film maker returning from Rangoon,said in an interview that he visited the Rangoon General Hospitaland saw more than 300 people wounded from the demonstrations.   News reports said students continued passing out leaflets todaycalling for protests to win democracy.   The diplomats said there were reports of minor skirmishes in theeastern suburb of Okkalapa and unconfirmed reports of looting andshooting in the working-class area where some of the fiercestfighting took place last week.   Sein Lwin stepped down Friday after 17 days in power. He quitamid reports that Burmese soldiers were turning against thegovernment and allowing people to march through some towns,demanding democracy and economic reforms.   Burma's official Rangoon Radio, which announced the resignation,gave no reason for it and did not say Sein Lwin's successor wouldbe.   Lambert said that prior to the announcement of the resignation,troops moved through Rangoon in large numbers with armoredpersonnel carriers.   After the radio broadcast, the soldiers stationed around thehotel where he was staying withdrew. But he said a number ofBurmese told him ``it was not over yet,'' and that much depended onwho would be Sein Lwin's successor.   Josef Silverstein, a leading American expert on Burma, said bytelephone that a likely candidate was Kyaw Htin, a relativelyliberal military officer.   Kyaw Htin, who received some military training in the UnitedStates, has been No. 3 in the government and party.   Diplomats in Rangoon said prices were soaring and food wasrunning low, with barely any transportation into the city from thecountryside. Hospitals, which normally function at threadbarelevels, were reported running seriously short of blood, bandagesand other vital medical supplies.   Even if peace returns to Burma, economic recovery is expected tobe slow and difficult. Once one of the world's wealthiest nations,Burma is now listed as among the world's poorest with a per capitaincome of less than $200 a year.   The economic problems were brought on by the isolationistpolicies of Ne Win, who ruled Burma for 26 years. He resigned lastmonth, citing student unrest in March and June, and Sein Lwin waselected his successor July 26.   Students, monks, workers and other filled the streets of Rangoonalmost immediately, demanding Sein Lwin's ouster. They blamed theformer general for brutally crushing the March and June unrest andcited his bloody suppression of Rangoon University riots after the1962 coup.   The protests spread to two dozen other cities. On Tuesday,soldiers began firing into mobs of demonstrators.   Reports from Burma indicated security forces in at least twotowns had sided with the protesters, and a guerrilla leader waginghis own war against the government called for a coordinatednationwide offensive.</TEXT></DOC>
