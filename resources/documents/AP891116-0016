But, he added, it will be considered with other parts ofa package for encouraging saving and investment.   ``One day we will have 60 votes to pass the capital gains tax''cut, Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said Wednesday, shortly before theSenate refused for the second consecutive day to shut off aDemocratic filibuster against the reduction.   Each time, the vote was 51-47 for limiting debate, nine short ofthe 60 needed. All 45 Republicans were joined by the same sixDemocrats in favoring a limitation.   President Bush, who promised a capital gains tax cut during hiscampaign last year, won a reduction in the House in September when60 Democrats and all but one Republican united behind the proposal.The effort died in the Senate because Majority Leader George J.Mitchell, D-Maine, convinced some Democrats who have favored areduction that now is not the time.   Bush contends that taxing capital gains _ profits from the saleof investments _ at a lower rate than applies to wages wouldencourage investment and create jobs.   ``If the capital gains tax is lowered ... some people willundertake transactions they would not otherwise undertake,''Packwood said. In turn, ``you will raise money (for the government)by lowering the capital gains tax rate and we can use that moneyfor other programs.''   Mitchell and Bentsen criticized the reduction on grounds 80percent of the benefit would go to people with incomes over$100,000 a year. It also would worsen the federal budget deficit,they said.   ``It will be a fantastic windfall ... for the very wealthiestAmericans, which the middle class will end up paying for throughhigher deficits or increased taxes,'' Mitchell said.   ``It is wrong, just wrong, that the president puts a higherpriority on cutting capital gains taxes than on reducing thefederal budget deficit.''   Packwood's plan would exclude a portion of capital gains fromtax, with a larger exclusion allowed for longer-held property. Forexample, 5 percent of the profits from the sale of assets ownedmore than one year would be excluded; the exclusion would increasegradually to a maximum of 35 percent for property owned more thanseven years.   The proposal also includes an amendment by Sen. Bill Roth,R-Del., expanding Individual Retirement Accounts. A worker couldcontribute up to $2,000 a year to an IRA and get no immediate taxbenefit. However, interest that accumulates would be tax-freeforever.   On another budget front, Senate leaders hope to complete abipartisan deficit-reduction package designed to help break aHouse-Senate deadlock over how to reduce this year's $116 billionfederal budget shortfall.   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said theproposal could be unveiled before the end of the week and wouldpressure the House and Bush administration to agree to abudget-cutting bill.   ``We think the legislative branch has a responsibility toproduce its own ... (deficit reduction) bill, and the executivebranch has the responsibility to decide whether it wants to signit,'' Sasser said.   Lawmakers and White House officials have been squabbling over adeficit-reduction measure for weeks. Because of that stalemate, $16billion in cuts in most federal programs were imposed by theGramm-Rudman law Oct. 1 and remain in effect.   The six Democrats who sided with Republicans on the voteWednesday are Sens. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Howell Heflinand Richard Shelby of Alabama, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, DavidBoren of Oklahoma and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut.   Sens. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, didnot vote. Both oppose the capital-gains tax cut.</TEXT></DOC>
