(products).andO;Topic:     Language TranslationResearch and DevelopmentJapanSoftware Engineering.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Lost in the TranslationandM;Deep in the heart of Fujitsu's English-language technical documentationdivision, in Kawasaki, Japan, more and more of the company's computer manualsare being translated from Japanese to English by a computer.andP;  A Fujitsumainframe running the company's Atlas II software shaves off 15 percent ofthe time it takes to translate an average manual.andP;  And Atlas isn't just formainframes: Fujitsu demonstrated a desktop version of the program at theComdex computer trade show in Las Vegas last November.andM;Daunting technical obstacles have kept translation software developmentsluggish.andP;  While a few PC programs purport to have translation capabilities,they're generally slow, error-prone, voracious consumers of disk space.andP;  Butin the age of the global economy, many observers believe that sophisticatedlanguage translation programs will help busnesses tap international markets.andO;Such systems could link the countries of the world in a way that meretelecommunications cannot, allowing business information, technology, andnews to pass freely across national boarders.andM;Many of Japan's leading electronics companies have been working on automatedtranslation since the late 1970s.andP;  The Japanse government has cosponsoredextensive efforts to advance machine translation as part of its FifthGeneration Computer Project and in conjunction with an electronic dictionaryresearch consortium.andM;Language ClassandM;But progress has been slow even for the Japanese.andP;  Computerized translationhas probably left more unfulfilled promises than any other category ofsoftware in the past 40 years.andP;  Researchers around the world launched effortsto create translation computers in the 1950s, then tried new approaches inthe 1960s.andP;  By 1966, disappointing results convinced U.S.andP;  funding agenciesthat the task was impossible.andP;  Funding from the U.S.andP;  science establishmentevaporated, leaving computer translation experts to rely on money fromspecialized projects that needed large volumes of documents translated, suchas U.S.andP;  aid schemes for Iran and Vietnam.andM;Only Japan has made a sizable, consistent commitment to a coherent vision ofmachine translation.andP;  Japan's joint government--industry research seeks tocreate multilingual electronic dictionaries that specify usage and meaningswith more detail than any existing dictionary.andM;Translation programs are already genuinely useful.andP;  Fujitsu reports sellingmore than 100 systems, with most going to research institutions that ownFujitsu mainframes.andP;  Because they have yet to prove their cost effectiveness,few translation systems have been sold for commercial applications.andM;John MacKin, a Milwaukee, Wisconsin, native who manages the FujitsuEnglish-language technical documentation operation, admits that translationsoftware is still in its infancy.andP;  Though the Atlas II system has beenoperating since 1987, it requires human intervention to clear up syntacticalambiguities and to improve readability.andP;  It's slow and costs almost as muchto use as human translators.andM;But MacKin says that in the past few months his operation has become cheaperand more reliable than one using only humans.andP;  By next year, he hopes,improvements to Atlas will have cut in half the number of man-hours requiredin big translation departments.andM;Learning to CrawlandM;Despite all this potential, the complexities of language have keptdevelopment slow.andP;  Translation isn't easy.andP;  Atlas, for example, tends to makethe same mistakes that native Japanese speakers make when translating toEnglish.andM;Consider a particularly unintelligible Atlas translation: &quot;It is describedhere about the abovementioned option parameter.&quot;andP;  The convolution comes fromthe lack of an explicit subject in the original Japanese phrase.andP;  MacKinwould edit the result to read: &quot;This section describes the option parametersdiscussed above.&quot;andM;Most Atlas sentences don't require such reworking.andP;  But Japanese and Englishare so different that all Atlas translations need some human editing.andM;Grammar poses other problems.andP;  Win Carus, editorial director of the businesssoftware department at Houghton Mifflin (which publishes the Roget's IIthesaurus for PCs), notes that Atlas and similar translators have difficultymaking sense of sentences that confuse the subject and object.andP;  In &quot;Thedoctor the patient visited was busy,&quot; for example, is the subject the doctoror the patient? Such ambiguities mean that humans have to preedit materialfor machine translation, removing phrases the computer can't understand.andM;Perhaps the biggest obstacle to computerized translators lies in syntax.andO;Take, for example, the following two sentences: &quot;Harry went to the park withthe ducks,&quot; and &quot;Harry went to the park with the girls.&quot;andP;  We immediatelyunderstand that the ducks lived at the park that Harry went to, whereas thegirls went with Harry to the park.andP;  Deciphering the meaning of those twosentences requires some commonsense understanding of the habitats of ducksand people.andP;  So far, this kind of broadbased knowledge is unavailable tocomputers.andM;These limitations restrict even the best machine translation systems to usein well-defined fields such as computer documentation or weather reporting,where terms have fairly consistent meaning and usage.andP;  This reduces both theuse and the cost effectiveness of computer translation.andM;To the DesktopandM;Many ambitious developers are waiting for the perfect system before theybring the technology to the desktop.andP;  The long-term goal is a system thatwill handle the translation on the PC, but in the short term, PCs willfunction mostly as terminals for the powerful networks of minicomputers doingthe translation.andP;  Even the smallest configurations of the systems currentlyunder development by Fujitsu and NEC demand as much as 8MB of RAM.andO;Dictionaries occupy most of the storage space.andM;So far, most of the smaller systems are finding homes in powerfulworkstations.andP;  Fujitsu sells a $15,000 version of Atlas that runs on itsG100-series work-stations, and at comdex, the company demonstrated the Atlasprogram on a Sun Microsystems SPARC workstation connected to aJapanese-language database in Japan.andP;  Fujitsu employees in Las Vegas typedsearch commands in English into the workstation and received English data inreturn.andP;  Atlas did the translating both ways, delivering rough but readableEnglish text to the SPARC's display.andM;While the Japanese lead the field, several Western companies are developingtheir own systems.andP;  The Logos Corporation, in Dedham, Massachusetts, has amainframe-based system that translates text from English to French, German,Italian, and Spanish, and from German to English, French, and Italian.andO;Provo, Utah--based Executive Communications Systems has just produced a PCEnglish-to-Japanese system for Bravice, the Japanese trading company.andP;  Asyet, however, it has no Japanese-to-English capabilities.andM;Carus, at Houghton Mifflin, argues that some Western machine translationproducts--including Logos's--are more technically advanced than those of theJapanese, yielding better translations of complex sentences.andP;  But U.S.andO;companies have concentrated on translating the European languages, whereasthe Japanese have specialized in linking Asian languages to English.andM;Carus adds that their concentration on building translation databases willgive the Japanese ultimate dominance in the machine translation field.andP;  &quot;whatthey've [already] realized is what everyone else is realizing--that theimportant part is to have knowledge&quot; in the computer, he says.andP;  Once again,consistent long-term effort is about to bear fruit for Japan.andM;Machine Translation Finds Its VoiceandM;Automated translation of the written word may help businesses unite theworld, but the average tourist would probably be more interested in aportable voice translator.andM;That simple observation has not been lost on at least one giant Japaneseconsumer electronics company.andP;  In Tokyo last year, the Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Company, Panasonic's parent company, demonstrated a prototype of avoice translation machine called the Speech Interpretation System.andM;A reporter at a Matsushita exhibition, where the demonstration took place,was asked to speak a sentence into a microphone in his native Japanese.andO;About five seconds later, the machine spoke back in English, &quot;My throathurts.andP;  I've had a slight headache since yesterday.&quot;andM;Much of the technology behind the Matsushita system was developed at CarnegieMellon University and currently recognizes only about 60 words.andP;  Butaccording to its developers, the system can translate the words of anyJapanese speaker, regardless of his or her accent.andM;Matsushita hopes eventually to put a small version of the translator in thehands of tourists and others who need to communicate a limited spokenvocabulary.andP;  Shigeru Hayakawa, a senior managing director at Matsushita,explained that the company expects to produce a suitcase-size version of themachine within two years and a notebook-size version of it within four years.andM;Despite the complexity of such technology, Hayakawa indicated a remarkableprice goal: &quot;Perhaps people will not buy it at a price higher than 50,000 yen[under $400],&quot; he said.andP;  If Matsushita is able to hit that price point,tourists may not have to learn any Japanese to order sushi.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
