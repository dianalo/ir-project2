The Supreme Court sentenced Jerry Richardson, 37, ex-bodyguardand coach of the Mandela United soccer team, in the killing ofJames ``Stompie'' Seipei Moeketsi, 14. There will be an automaticreview by an appeals court.   The South African Press Association quoted WitwatersrandAttorney-General Klaus van Lieres as saying he now will considerthe role in the case of Mrs. Mandela, wife of Nelson Mandela,deputy president of the African National Congress.   Mrs. Mandela has not been charged. Her driver and otherassociates face trial next month on kidnapping and assault charges.   The judge held during Richardson's trial that Mrs. Mandela wasat her home when Moeketsi was assaulted there. Moeketsi was killedafter being held at the house.   Supreme Court Justice Brian O'Donovan rejected defense argumentsthat a need by Richardson to gain Mrs. Mandela's favor, and adesire to do whatever he thgought would please her, was amitigating factor in the killing.   ``It is difficult to see how kidnap and murder can be mitigatedby the desire to please anybody,'' O'Donovan said.   He also sentenced Richardson to 18 years imprisonment forkidnapping, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, andattempted murder.   Moeketsi was found stabbed to death in January 1989, afterRichardson took him from Mrs. Mandela's house in the black townshipof Soweto. Richardson lived at the house with other young men whocalled themselves the Mandela United Soccer Team and acted as Mrs.Mandela's bodyguards.   Last February, a group of South Africa's most prominent blackleaders said the soccer team engaged in a ``reign of terror'' inSoweto. They urged the community to shun Mrs. Mandela.   She began to reappear at anti-apartheid rallies, however, a fewmonths before her husband was freed from prison.   According to trial testimony, Richardson and other associates ofMrs. Mandela abducted the boy and three young men from a MethodistChurch-run home in Soweto in late December 1988. The three mentestified that Mrs. Mandela, Richardson and other bodyguards beatand whipped them in a room at her house.   Moeketsi was accused of being a police informer, according tothe testimony, and the three men were accused of having homosexualrelations with a Methodist minister who ran the church home.   O'Donovan ruled that no evidence emerged to support theallegation against the minister. Only Richardson was tried for themurder.   Referring to trial testimony, defense lawyer H. Joubert saidMrs. Mandela had said Moeketsi and the three abducted men were``not fit to be alive,'' and that she began the beatings.   President F. W. de Klerk suspended hangings in February, butcourts may still impose the death sentence in murder cases when thejudge finds no mitigating factors.</TEXT></DOC>
