Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.,said in response to testimony from Reginald Bartholomew,undersecretary of State for security assistance. Bartholomewappeared before the Banking Committee's subcommittee oninternational finance.   Bartholomew told the subcommittee the administration wouldsupport some sanctions, with the president having the authority tosay when they would be used.   But he said he opposed sanctions for past actions and said theuse of U.S. sanctions outside the United States would violateinternational law. Joan McEntee, undersecretary of Commerce forexport administration, said power to impose additional sanctions isnot needed.   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa, accused the administration of having adouble standard, pointing out that the actions Bush has takenagainst China for the killing of demonstrators are not based oninternational law.   ``What your are saying is that if a commercial party is involved,they deserve to be treated better than the butchers of Beijing,'' hesaid. ``If that's your position, it's very hard for us to acceptit.''   Heinz is co-author with Sen. Robert Dole,R-Kan, the Senateminority leader, of a bill that calls for curbing exports to theUnited States from companies that help countries get chemical orbiological weapons.   He insisted on the need for Congress to prod the administrationto take action on trade matters.   ``The record is that when we've taken strong action, we've gottenresults,'' Heinz said. ``When we've done nothing, nothing happened.Toshiba is one example.   ``And I've got to tell you, in my judgment it took thelegislative equivalent of half a dozen atomic bombs to wake the(west) German government up on the Imhausen sale. First time theylooked at it, what did they say? `Huh, it couldn't happen here'...   ``Have you got any examples that say keeping this stuff quiet anddoing nothing succeeds?''   In the Toshiba case a subsidiary of the Japanese company sold theSoviet Union machines that could have been useful in protectingSoviet submarines from detection by U.S. forces. A law approved byformer President Reagan curbed sales in this country by both thesubsidiary and the parent company.   The Imhausen firm is accused of helping Libya build a plant tomake poison gas. The West German government has acted against thecompany.   ``Senator, you may be right in those specific cases,''Bartholomew replied.   ``But if we here in the United States pass a law whichautomatically, without discretion, mandates sanctions where theoperations of foreign companies are concerned, we are concerned thatthe reaction of foreign governments will be that it is theirbusiness to police their companies. It is their cooperation that wewant.''   Sen. Timothy E. Wirth, D-Colo., called the answers the worst hehad heard in 15 years of experience in Congress.   ``I get the impression you don't feel the sense of urgency allover the country,'' he said.   Bartholomew replied that the question was getting at least thepriority in the Bush administration that it is getting in the Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
