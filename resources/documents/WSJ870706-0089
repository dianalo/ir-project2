The victories, in contests designed to test the skills of small armored and reconnaissance units, came as a shock to Army officials, who have watched U.S. teams turn in some dismal performances in both contests, especially the grueling Boeselager Cup.    The Boeselager is held annually among West German Army cavalry units. Other North Atlantic Treaty Organization cavalry units are invited to compete, but the cup has been won by West Germans every year since the U.S. first entered it in 1979.    In May, after three exhausting days of night reconnaissance, swimming, small arms firing and other events, a unit of the 11th U.S. Armored Cavalry Regiment battled fatigue and mounting pressure by trotting out its secret weapon: a set of large hi-fi speakers.    The final practice for the grenade throwing event was done to Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; and the theme to the movie &quot;Top Gun.&quot; After that, the U.S. team went on to outscore everybody.    The U.S. also won a second contest, the Canadian Army Trophy Competition. The contest is held between combined tank units of NATO armies. This year U.S. Army hopes were riding on a new, computerized training simulator that mimicked the range at Grafenwoehr, West Germany, where the competition was held last month.    On the last day of the competition, after it appeared a West German unit had the top score locked up, a tank platoon of the 3rd U.S. Armored Division discovered that a simulator couldn't prepare them for all of the quirks of the contest. Fifteen minutes before the U.S. unit's entry, one of its four M-1 tanks failed.    The crew jumped into a substitute tank, which was forced to confront two sets of targets simultaneously when the machine gun in another M-1 malfunctioned. Nonetheless, the U.S. team fired a perfect score.    Though the top score had eluded U.S. Army teams since they first entered the contest in 1977, Sgt. David Wills, the gunner in the substitute tank, made it all sound simple. &quot;It was total teamwork. Everyone knew what they were doing and when you put it all together, you got what we got.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
