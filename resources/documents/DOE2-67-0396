The field dependence in this regionmay be understood assuming the existence of a random network of Josephsonjunctions (JJ). The most important experimental facts resulting fromour measurements are an exponential-like behavior for the power absorptionas a function of the magnetic field H, the existence of a critical temperatureT/sub c//sub J/ clearly below T/sub c/ above which the exponential absorptionis no longer present, the behavior as a function of the temperature ofa field H/sub d/(T) which is interpreted as a junction dephasing field.We show that the JJ model allows a quantitative fit of the experimentaldata when a statistical distribution for the junction geometrical parametersis chosen.</TEXT></DOC>
