Federal mediator Sam Cognata of the National Mediation Board wassitting down for discussions with the two sides behind closeddoors. But the airline was taking a hard line in public on the fateof the 2,200 pilots who last week ended their sympathy walkout.   ``The reality of the situation is that once strikers were notavailable to work, when the replacement workers take those jobs,they inherit a right to those jobs,'' Eastern Vice President TomMatthews told reporters.   Miami-based Eastern, which began rebuilding without its unionsafter the Machinists struck on March 4, said it has enough pilots _1,850 _ to operate its current schedule. Of those, about 1,000 werehired as replacements; the rest crossed picket lines during thestrike or were management pilots.   Skip Copeland, who heads the Eastern chapter of the Air LinePilots Association, took a conciliatory position as Tuesday'smeeting opened.   ``We're going to have to somehow come to a position that'sacceptable to both parties, however that is,'' Copeland said. ``Weknow our position and their position are tremendously differentright now. They say that we've been replaced; we say status quo.''   The meetings were expected to break up after the session so ALPAleaders could consider Eastern's proposals.   The airline's flight attendants union, which also voted lastweek to abandon its sympathy strike, was scheduled to meetWednesday with management. The Machinists union has been left aloneon the picket lines.   Eastern has asked a federal judge in Miami to clarify the rightsof employees who are currently working and determine the rights ofstrikers who wish to return to work. Company spokesman Robin Matellsaid no hearing date had been set.   Eastern last June sought in bankruptcy court in New York to havethe striking pilots' contract invalidated, but later withdrew thatrequest.   After direct talks broke down, the pilots requested federalmediation. There also were negotiations with the court-appointedbankruptcy examiner, attorney David I. Shapiro.   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors five daysafter the strike began, and is currently in bankruptcyreorganization under court supervision.</TEXT></DOC>
