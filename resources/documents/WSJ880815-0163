The excesses of Stalinism and Maoism ultimately fell to the hard pragmatism of running a modern state. Now, it seems, the steam is going out of Khomeiniism, even before Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's Islamic leader, himself has died.    The cease-fire agreement in the Iran-Iraq war, reached at the United Nations last week, is a clear defeat for the ayatollah. It sets back his dreams of exporting revolution and will redirect his regime toward solving domestic problems.    Iran's leaders are already trying to break their international isolation. They have re-established diplomatic relations with France and Canada. They are talking to the British about re-establishing ties and with the archbishop of Canterbury about British hostages in Lebanon.    As for the American hostages, the U.S. is understandably wary of trusting supposedly moderate Iranians after having been so burned by the Iran-Contra scandal. But senior U.S. officials concede that the rise of Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani gives reason for hope, and George Bush's troubled campaign for president gives motivation for trying.    Still, officials insist they aren't yet negotiating to free the hostages, although a slew of Iranians around the world, including the Iran-Contra scandal's Manucher Ghorbanifar, are offering themselves as middlemen.    The clear political winner in Tehran is Mr. Rafsanjani, who has been trying to make friends instead of war ever since became acting commander of the armed forces earlier this year. In a recent sermon, he rebuffed radical rivals, chief among whom is Interior Minister Ali Akhbar Mohtashemi-Pur, who believe the revolution can only triumph through endless struggle against countless enemies.    &quot;The main issue is that we can stop making enemies without reason due to this new move,&quot; he said after Iran announced it wanted a cease-fire. &quot;There are many people who are currently providing resources to {Iraqi leader} Saddam {Hussein} who wouldn't have done so if our foreign policy had been acceptable, or they would have supported both of us.&quot;    Recently back from Iran, Robin Wright of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace says, &quot;You feel a whole shift in the focus of the revolution. The end of the war is only part of a broader package for the Iranians. Everyone is looking at the war, but there is much more at stake.&quot;    Since the war began in September 1980, Iran's theocrats have used the conflict to consolidate their power, purge their opponents and repress any sign of dissent. But with Iraq invading Iranian territory, arms markets drying up, and Ayatollah Khomeini older and sicker, the war's end seemed the best way to preserve the revolution. Now, without the war as the glue to hold Iranian factions together, the regime must show more economic progress and political vision.    &quot;Once the war is over, the regime will have to come face-to-face with domestic problems, which in a way have been postponed,&quot; says Shaul Bakhash, author of &quot;The Reign of the Ayatollahs.&quot; But that doesn't mean the revolution will end, he says. In creating a theocracy, &quot;the ayatollah has successfully changed the system of government, replaced old elites, and the state has taken over most important aspects of the economy,&quot; he says.    U.S. officials fear Mr. Rafsanjani's enemies may still seek to undermine a more pragmatic Iran by attacking U.S. ships, breaking the cease-fire or through terrorism. A State Department official says Washington now would view such incidents more as part of an Iranian power struggle than government policy.    But even extremists may accept the cease-fire. Iran's arsenal has run low, Iraq's chemical warfare and strikes against cities have been devastating, and the public mood is so flat that even the U.S. shooting down of the Iranian airliner didn't seem to ignite the old revolutionary fervor.    Ending the war also gives Iran's leadership relief from the advancing troops of the National Liberation Army, the Iraq-backed Iranian insurgency force that has penetrated deep into Iranian territory in recent weeks.    Iran now will demand that Baghdad stop backing this group, and United Nations peace-keepers will separate the NLA from its Iraqi bases. NLA spokesman Alaedin Touran says the armed struggle may take a breather while the ayatollah struggles with internal difficulties following the war's end. If, as Mr. Touran expects, the regime's repression continues and popular opposition grows, urban guerrilla warfare could be the NLA's next move.    &quot;You've got to wait a bit to see what comes up,&quot; he says. &quot;The war has helped Khomeini a lot in keeping power. Now this peaceful settlement is really a test of the regime's ability to survive.&quot;    (Revised WSJ Aug. 17, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
