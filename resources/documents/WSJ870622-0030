Union leaders said the move probably means the union's 2,800 NBC members -- about a third of the company's work force -- will strike.    &quot;It looks like we're going to be there on the street, unless there is a miracle,&quot; said John Krieger, a spokesman for the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, which last struck NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, in 1976.    The possibility of a strike comes amid growing signs of a strike among members of the Directors Guild of America, whose talks with the three major networks on a contract to replace an agreement expiring June 30 appear to be stalling.    On Tuesday, a federal mediator brought NBC and the union together for the first time since the union's four-year contract expired March 31. Both sides were deadlocked. Areas of dispute include use of temporary workers at NBC, the length of the new contract and use of non-network news services. </TEXT></DOC>
