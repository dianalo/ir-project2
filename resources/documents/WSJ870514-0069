The dollar's highs, both in value and in trading volume, were reached in Tokyo after Finance Ministry officials met with chief executive officers of major Japanese financial institutions and urged the institutions to refrain from speculating against the dollar.    Otherwise, the dollar continued to trade quietly in a narrow band, with buyers and sellers waiting at the ends of the range to enforce its limits.    &quot;The market is struggling, in both directions,&quot; Keiichi Udagawa, chief trader at Bank of Tokyo's New York branch, said.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 140.25 yen, compared with 139.85 a day earlier. The U.S. currency also climbed to 1.7948 West German marks from 1.7914.    The Japanese Finance Ministry's pep talk helped the dollar reach its intraday high of 140.90 yen in Tokyo after opening there at 139.90. Traders doubted, however, that the government pressure would have a lasting impact on the market.    Last month, when the Bank of Japan spent an estimated $10 billion in foreign exchange trading to support the dollar, Finance Ministry officials were reported to be asking Japanese financial concerns to temper their dollar selling. Dollar sales and hedging by Japanese exporters and securities concerns were major factors in the dollar's plunge to historic lows against the yen in April.    A Finance Ministry official described yesterday's talk as &quot;moral persuasion.&quot; He sought to dismiss any possibility of new regulations on foreign exchange trading in Japan.    Japan opposes a further dollar decline because it would harm Japanese exporters and holders of dollar-denominated investments. A weaker dollar tends to make Japanese and other imported goods more costly for Americans and creates foreign exchange losses for holders of U.S. bonds and stocks.    But the government's plea to refrain from speculation isn't expected to have a lasting effect, mainly because many Japanese companies consider the Finance Ministry's call to be contrary to their own interests.    &quot;To tell people not to hedge against a declining dollar is indeed immoral persuasion,&quot; Robert A. Brusca, senior vice president and chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International, said.    Bank of Tokyo's Mr. Udagawa said strong buying interest at the 139.50 yen level and selling pressure above 140.50 yen were maintaining the dollar's range.    &quot;I don't think that range will be so easily broken,&quot; he said.    In early trading Thursday in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 140.15 yen.    Caution ahead of today's report on the U.S. merchandise trade balance for March discouraged major position-taking yesterday. Traders generally expect to hear that the trade deficit narrowed to about $14 billion from $15.1 billion in February. Any unexpected swing in the number probably would change the tone of currency trading for the next several days, market participants said.    &quot;The trade figures are going to tell us which way we're going to go,&quot; Charles A. Luma, vice president, foreign exchange, at Industrial Bank of Japan's New York branch, said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for May delivery fell $1.30 an ounce to $458.40 in brisk trading estimated at five million ounces.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Wednesday, May 13, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
