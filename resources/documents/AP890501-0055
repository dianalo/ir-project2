Several student leaders, meanwhile, said they have been warnedto stop planning a protest Thursday, the 70th anniversary ofChina's first democratic movement.   Two Cabinet ministers met students today, the third day ofmeetings to discuss student demands for reforms including a freepress and an end to official privileges and corruption.   Some students complained the government has snubbed theirindependent group, the United Association of Beijing Universities,by refusing to allow it to represent the student movement in thetalks. The government says the group is illegal.   ``We don't recognize this `dialogue,''' said a spokesman for thegroup, which has been leading two weeks of protests including thelargest protest marches in 40 years of communist rule and aweek-old class boycott.   ``We demand a dialogue based on the principles of equality andopenness, conducted directly between democratically chosen studentrepresentatives and government decision-makers,'' he said at a newsconference. The student did not want his name used for fear ofgovernment reprisals.   Wang Dan, a student leader at Beijing University, the nation'smost prestigious school, called for establishment of a nationwideindependent student group and indefinite continuation of the classboycott by about 75,000 students in Beijing and nearby Tianjin.   On Monday, the minister of metallurgical industry, Qi Yuanjing,met students at the Beijing College of Science and Technology, andMinister of the Aeronautics and Astronautics Industry, LinZhongtang, met students from the Beijing Aeronautical Institute,state-run radio reported.   Officials acknowledged to students that government decisionsoften are made too quickly and without sufficient study, the radioreported.   At the first meetings, the government selected 45 students tomeet Education Minister He Dongchang and other senior officialsSaturday and 29 students to meet Sunday with Beijing Mayor ChenXitong and city party chief Li Ximing.   Officials at the meetings insisted they share students'opposition to worsening corruption, but urged them to ``calmdown,'' halt plans for new marches and end the class boycott.   The Guangming Daily, China's national newspaper forintellectuals, praised the meetings as expressions of ``socialistdemocracy'' and channels for ``clearing up misunderstandings andsuspicion.''   Students, however, complained they were only allowed to askquestions and there was no give-and-take.   ``The government answers to student questions illustrated theirlack of sincerity,'' the United Association spokesman said. Heaccused the government of trying to ``deceive public opinion'' bymaking an appearance of conceding to student demands.   ``Students, we risked bloodshed and danger to get as far as wehave!'' said a poster at the People's University. ``Please continueyour efforts.''   China's Communist Party, meanwhile, marked the internationallabor holiday May Day today by appealing to workers in editorialsand speeches to resist ``forces of instability.''   So far there has been no large-scale organized support amongworkers for the student marches. But workers have cheered onstudent protesters and voiced support for demands for an end toofficial corruption.   Although the government toned down its initial harsh criticismof the student movement after tens of thousands of Beijing citizensapplauded a student march Thursday, it has continued to claim anunspecified ``handful of people'' are illegally plotting revolution.</TEXT></DOC>
