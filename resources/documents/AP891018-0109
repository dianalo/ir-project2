But they must not lose sight of what isreally at stake in Panama. ...   President Bush repeated at a Friday press conference his desireto see Noriega ousted. Insisting that he did not mean to imply``carte blanche support'' to a future coup attempt, the presidentadded, ``I wouldn't mind force if it could be done in a prudentmanner.''   Apart from being unclear, the statement was unwise. ...   But with the widespread opposition of his own people, Noriegawill fall in time. Until then, the only way he can survivepolitically is to pose as a nationalist standing up to Yanquiintervention.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 11   The News and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on Panama:   The group of military officers who moved against Gen. Noriegadid not openly ask for help from the United States. Although thecoup leaders wanted covert assistance, they viewed overt U.S.intervention as embarrassing and damaging.   They wanted to give the impression, at least, that the coup wasthe work of patriotic Panamanians, not of a cadre of officerscarrying out orders from Washington.   The question that members of Congress should be askingthemselves is whether the American people want militaryintervention in Panama. So far the polls indicate that a majorityof Americans approve President Bush's policy of patience andprudence.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 14   Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on Mideast peace talks:   The Israeli-Palestinian peace process is, as usual, stalled, butthis time a clear call has gone out for American help in getting itback in motion.   It's time for another Cape David effort.   That term refers to American help, led by former president JimmyCarter at the presidential retreat, which produced a peace treatybetween Israel and Egypt.   Now, Egypt is trying to return the favor by playing the role ofmidwife to another potential agreement, negotiating with both sidesin hopes of getting Israel and the Palestinians talking directly....   In apparent response, Secretary of State James Baker has calledfor a three-way meeting in Washington between U.S., Egyptian andIsraeli representatives to work on a formula for getting talksgoing. It's none too soon.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 15   The Reporter, Fond du Lac, Wis. on the census:   We think the U.S. House of Representatives was dead wrong ... inits vote to count foreign citizens who are in this countryillegally as part of the 1990 census. ...   Southern and western states with large populations of illegalaliens will gain congressional representation at the expense ofthose states which do not attract them. ...   Legally, those aliens cannot be considered part of the politicalcommunity. They cannot vote for members of Congress but do dilutethe representation given to U.S. citizens. ...   Congress should be encouraged by the American people toreconsider.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 11   The Herald-Dispatch, Huntington, W.Va, on Jim Bakker:   Even after a jury convicted TV evangelist Jim Bakker of 24counts of fraud and conspiracy, the faith of many of his followersremained unshaken.   One of his flock, a major donor to Bakker's PTL ministry, wasasked if she wanted her money back. She replied: ``No, I didn'tgive my money to Jim Bakker. I gave it to the Lord.''   The Bakker trial shows that a few housand suckers are born everyminute, eager to become the victims of smooth-talkers who claim theLord handed them a collection plate.   If citizens need government protection from phony and dangerousmedicines, from tainted beef, from chemicals that poison our airand water, heaven knows they need protection from the con men who _like Jim Bakker _ take their money to build air-conditioned doghouses and buy fleets of Rolls-Royces.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 15   Wilkes-Barre (Pa.) Times Leader on reported UFOs in the SovietUnion:   (The Soviet news agency) Tass' yarn about a UFO sighting 300miles southeast of Moscow was interesting _ hoax or not.   For one thing, the Soviet Union's visiting space creatures(described as being nine to 12 feet tall and resembling humans, butwith very small heads and three eyes) seem different from thoseroutinely seen here in America (tall, spindly-legged, uglycreatures with triangular heads, two eyes, and initials for names,a la ``E.T.'').   For another, theirs landed in a park during daylight, while oursusually land at night near a seldom-traveled road that runs along acornfield in Iowa.   The Soviet sighting is interesting for yet another reason: Thisis apparently a first in that country _ which as recently as 10years ago used to label our UFO sightings as a capitalist trick ordevice.   See, Ivan, we told you so!</TEXT><NOTE>End Editorial Rdp</NOTE></DOC>
