The ``summary trial,'' a rare form of court proceeding, is aneffort to encourage a settlement in the class action suitrepresenting about 14,000 people who live near the Feed MaterialsProduction Center in Fernald and National Lead of Ohio Inc., whichoperated the plant for the federal government from 1951 to 1985.   The plaintiffs allege the 38-year-old plant, 18 miles northwestof Cincinnati, has polluted their soil, air and water withradioactive materials as well as asbestos, chlorides and barium,damaging their health, lowering the value of their property andcausing them emotional stress.   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel set aside more than a weekfor the summary trial.   The plant's owner, the U.S. Department of Energy, denies chargesmade in the suit but has begun a cleanup program at the plant site.The department admits that over the years, more than 300,000 poundsof radioactive uranium oxide got past the plant's air-filteringsystems and into the air.   Both sides have prepared for the mock trial as if it werebinding, knowing that a jury finding against their side wouldcreate pressure on them to settle. The plaintiffs' lawyer, StanleyM. Chesley, said he wants to negotiate a settlement in the case butthe Energy Department is unwilling and he hopes the trial willencourage a settlement.   ``We're finally going to hear the story of Fernald. We'refinally going to have it in a court of law,'' Chesley said. ``Wethink it's a wonderful opportunity to resolve a dispute.''   Energy Department lawyer Henry A. Gill Jr. declined to say ifthe department would be willing to settle the case. He said nosettlement talks are under way.   The Energy Department contends that National Lead was acontractor following government orders and is innocent. Thedepartment has conceded that the government told NLO to putpriority on production, even if it meant ignoring environmentalregulations. It says that is no longer the case with the currentoperator, Westinghouse Materials Co.   Spiegel has previously used the summary trial, a method somelawyers and judges dislike, to coax a settlement in a complex casethat might otherwise take up weeks of court time.   Gill said he would not regard the jury's verdict as a finalstatement.   ``Absolutely not. It's, by its very nature, a non-bindingverdict. It's a settlement tool that some judges like to avoidusing,'' Gill said.   He declined comment when asked if he thought a summary trial wasa good idea in the present case.   Chesley said he will tell the jury that the plant's neighborswant the government to pay money that they can get regular medicalmonitoring _ including cancer detection tests.   The courts offer a faster and better way for the residents toget relief than waiting for Washington to clean up the plant, hesaid.   ``It's always been my view that the court system is the greatequalizer. I'm not taking anything away from Congress,'' Chesleysaid. ``But the courts do cause litigation and disputes to beresolved. ... The only place you can get true compensation forvictims is in the courthouse.''   The judge ordered officials of the Energy Department andNational Lead to attend the trial.</TEXT></DOC>
