The protests so far have been mild, as students from severalcolleges test the limits of tolerance. But they have been takenseriously by officials in a country with a history of studentmilitancy.   In 1966, students were a powerful force in agitating for theremoval of the late President Sukarno in favor of his eventualsuccessor, Gen. Suharto.   And it was a group of students whil in 1945 kidnapped Sukarnoand persuaded him to declare independence from the Dutch.   Students were a constant headache for the authorities in the1970s, helping spark the so-called Malari riots in January 1974during a visit by then Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka.   A student demonstration was joined by thousands of poorJakartans, who took to the streets in a mass protest against theunequal distribution of wealth.   When order was restored, 13 people had died, 770 were arrested,including many students, and property damage was extensive.   The rioting was officially blamed on two banned politicalparties allegedly trying to overthrow the government. Security wastightened, 11 newspapers were closed and a couple of seniorgenerals lost their jobs.   The government was disturbed by the uprising, however, andSuharto ordered the rich to stop flaunting their wealth.   Student dissent flared again when Suharto was re-electedunopposed for a third term in March 1978 and activists who accusedSuharto and his family of corruption were briefly jailed.   By then the authorities had had enough.   Student political activity was banned and student councilsabolished in their previous form as pressure groups for politicalaction.   Students had to sign statements when they enrolled promising notto take part in political activity or criticize the governmentwhile on campus.   Scores of expulsions enforced the disciplinary mood and activistprofessors also were ousted.   The regulations remain in effect and student demonstrationsstill are banned, but controls have been eased in recent months,clearly with official sanction, diplomatic observers say.   Students have taken to the streets to protest against the 1978ban on political activity on campus. They have also voicedopposition to a 25 percent increase in electricity charges and thelimited compensation for families forced from land in Central Javaby construction of a World Bank-financed dam.   Demonstrations by as many as 2,000 students at a time have beengenerally peaceful. Last month, troops reportedly entered thecampus of the Islamic University in Bandung, 110 miles southeast ofJakarta, and student leaders said 50 of their colleagues wereinjured. The army denied any violence.   Students at the Jakarta Teachers' Training College reacted witha demonstration in which they burned a papier-mache replica of amilitary boot.   The reaction of top officials has been ambivalent.   President Suharto said university rectors should be heldresponsible for the behavior of their students. Several rectorsrejected this, saying they were not responsible for the off-campusactivities of their students.   ``Demonstrations or protest rallies are clearly unacceptable,''said armed forces spokesman Brig. Gen. Nurhadi Purwosaputro. Butthe armed forces commander-in-chief, Gen. Try Sutrisno, was quotedas saying demonstrations were allowed providing they were notdisorderly.   Education and Culture Minister Fuad Hassan, himself a studentactivist in the mid-1960s, said students had the ``right to expresspublic concern as long as they do not launch demonstrations onbehalf of their universities.'   Home Affairs Minister Rudini said he was ``not concerned yetwith the recent student ... protests because they are stilltolerable and not disturbing national stability.''</TEXT></DOC>
