Maybe they don't have be so scared of U.S. courts. Last week, three federal appeals judges raised criminal rights to a new level of absurdity by throwing out the convictions of four Colombian drug runners because of comments the trial judge made after the jury had convicted. President Bush wants tougher law enforcement, but with judges like these all we can say is, Good luck, Mr. President.    The case of U.S. v. Luis Edwardo-Franco, Rocio Gallego aka &quot;Mariela Florez,&quot; Jorge Lopez and Sergio Castro-Munoz perfectly illustrates how the trivializing of our legal system contributes to the drug crisis. Two years ago the police became suspicious of residents of a house in Jericho, Long Island. The cops followed two of them delivering a plastic bag from Long Island to a Harlem tenement. The bag contained more than two pounds of cocaine. A search of the house found 33 more pounds of coke (which as crack would fetch more than $2 million), weapons and notebooks documenting the drug traffic.    A jury had no difficulty convicting the four on drugs and weapons charges. Then came the sentencing hearing before Federal Judge Mark Constantino. The defense lawyer asked for leniency on the grounds that the defendants would be deported back to Colombia after they served their time in jail. Judge Constantino was not impressed. &quot;They don't have too much regard for judges,&quot; he said, noting that Colombian drug lords had &quot;killed 32 chief judges in that nation. . . . Nobody's going to shoot me.&quot; Then the lawyer said that as immigrants they &quot;suffer a tremendous pressure moneywise.&quot; Judge Constantino replied that &quot;nobody tells them to come and get involved in cocaine.&quot;    This rugged individualism was too much for Federal Appeals Judges Ellsworth Van Graafeiland, James Oakes and George Pratt. They threw out the convictions by detecting an anti-Colombian bias in Judge Constantino's comments about the fate of judges in Colombia. They said that Judge Constantino's &quot;ethnic prejudice somehow had infected the judicial process.&quot; Despite the usual difficulty proving judicial bias, the appeals court here found bias without pointing to anything specific: &quot;Our conclusion in this regard should not be interpreted to mean that the district judge in fact was guilty of such prejudice; it means that he appeared to be.&quot;    They somersaulted from the supposed appearance of bias to infer that the entire trial must have been tainted. They cited trivial points that would never stand on their own, such as that Judge Constantino had twice found a defense lawyer in contempt. The appeals judges even cast doubt on the evidence of any crime, despite the inconvenient fact that a defense lawyer had admitted the defendants were &quot;mules&quot; who kept drug records and made deliveries, arguing only that they didn't get the &quot;big profits.&quot;    The appeals judges' behavior may have something to do with the surprise they expressed that Judge Constantino would give 30-year-terms to these first-time offenders. This punishment may sound reasonable to you and to us, but judges are more used to seeing first-timers plea bargain down to probation. For his part, Judge Constantino tells us, &quot;I have never been known as a judge with a fear of expressing an opinion. That's what I get paid for.&quot; He denies any &quot;ethnic prejudice&quot; -- or any appearance thereof.    This judicial effort to free criminals is a perfect example of our &quot;Miranda&quot;-style justice. Courtrooms are now reduced to gaming parlors in which clever lawyers devise new ways to suppress truth-finding evidence and reverse reasonable sentences. We are &quot;at war&quot; against drugs because our more civilized method of attack -- the legal system -- has fallen apart. </TEXT></DOC>
