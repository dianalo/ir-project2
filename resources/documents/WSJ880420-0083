The over-the-counter market rose yesterday with the Nasdaq composite index ending 1.76 higher, or 0.47%, at 376.86. In contrast the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue chips fell 0.43%. But the OTC market was withering badly near the close and traders said if there was more time prices would have fallen further.    &quot;It really didn't feel very good on the close,&quot; said Arthur Pacheco, who runs OTC trading at Cantor Fitzgerald andamp; Co., a New York brokerage firm. &quot;They would have done more damage if they had the time.&quot;    For most of the day, OTC stocks rallied, with the Nasdaq 100 index of the largest OTC industrial stocks up 6.72 at one point. However, this index closed only 1.54 higher.    Said E.E. &quot;Buzzy&quot; Geduld, president of Herzog Heine Geduld Inc., which trades OTC issues for other brokers: &quot;Up until 2 p.m. it looked like they would just go to the moon. About an hour before closing it just cracked.&quot;    Traders said yesterday's trading pattern was typical when the exchanges have a late turnaround; the OTC market's reaction generally lags, and so on a day like yesterday Nasdaq indexes don't have time to catch up with the fall in the Dow Jones industrials. On Monday just the opposite happened as the OTC market scrambled to catch up with the late rebound on the exchanges.    Some OTC traders noted that big institutional investors started selling late yesterday -- as opposed to traders selling among themselves -- a sign that the OTC market may continue weak today. &quot;It was real selling,&quot; late yesterday, explained one trader.    Volume picked up from Monday's lethargic pace, but trading was still light at 128.5 million shares. Of the 91 million shares that traded on Nasdaq's National Market System, which includes most of the largest and most heavily traded OTC stocks, about 46.9 million rose and 23.2 million fell.    Among the generally smaller stocks that don't trade on NMS, 56.3 million shares rose and 27.1 million fell, a slightly better performance than the NMS stocks.    Dominating the market with 5.3 million shares traded, nearly triple any other stock, was MCI Communications, which rose 1/2 to 12 3/4. The Washington, D.C.-based company, Nasdaq's biggest telecommunications stock, yesterday reported first-quarter net income of $69 million, almost three times year-earlier earnings; per-share earnings rose to 24 cents from nine cents.    Big technology issues led the afternoon slide. Seagate Technology fell 1 1/8 to 19; Lotus Development fell 1 to 23 1/2; and Ashton-Tate declined 3/4 to 27 1/4.    Microsoft, which yesterday reported third-quarter net income of 67 cents a share, compared with 35 cents a share a year earlier, escaped relatively unscathed, falling 1/2 to 54 1/4.    Henley Manufacturing surged 2 3/4 to 33 on volume of 473,100 shares, more than seven times its average. Smith Barney analyst James H. Wilbur yesterday issued a buy recommendation. The stock, which was trading at 20 at year end, started rising last week after a Bermuda-based partnership said it planned on boosting its stake to more than 15% from 12.9%. A spokesman for Hampton, N.H.-based Henley Manufacturing, a chemicals and auto products company, said he recognized that last week's announcement and yesterday's buy recommendation had moved the stock, but declined further comment.    Parent Henley Group, a big La Jolla, Calif.-based company that also has engineering and financial-services interests, partially spun off Henley Manufacturing in December and still holds a 51.6% stake. Henley Group rose 1/8 to 22 5/8 on 625,200 shares.    Blockbuster Entertainment at one point was trading at 25 3/4, up 1 3/4, and on its way to three consecutive days of gains. But the late selling knocked the stock back to 24, unchanged. Traders told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report that an upbeat article in the May 2 issue of Forbes magazine had been boosting the stock. The Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based company is trying to become the first nationwide chain of video rental stores. </TEXT></DOC>
