Pan Am said the expansion out of Miami International Airportinitially will serve five cities and increase to 10 next fall.   The move is the latest by a major carrier to offer in-statetravelers better prices and more options and is expected tointensify competition in Florida.   American Airlines initiated its American Eagle commuter servicein October and plans to serve eight cities by year's end.   Continental-Eastern Express flies to 10 cities from Miami witheight planes. On Dec. 15, the service will drop Continental fromits name and plans to add six planes and 25 flights in February,Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said.   ``It will be a buyer's market,'' said Jack Guiteras, presidentof Lorraine Travel.   Guiteras said he expected the increased competition to lead tolower fares since travelers to smaller Florida locales will havewider choices of airlines, flight times and fares.   Candace Browning, an airline analyst with Wertheim Schroder andamp;Co. in New York, said: ``Pan Am is taking a long-term perspectivetoward building their market share.''   Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett said the first of the newaircraft is scheduled for delivery next spring and will be put intoservice by Pan Am Express in intra-Florida markets to feed PanAmerican World Airways growing hub operation out of Miami.   The service is to include 25 daily round-trip flights, alloperated into Miami; five daily round trips from Key West; six fromSarasota; six from Fort Myers; five from West Palm Beach; and threefrom Melbourne.   The flights will connect with Pan American World Airways' Miamidepartures, which by Dec. 15 will total 66 daily, including 42flights to other U.S. cities and 24 to international destinationsin Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean.   The additional 25 Pan Am Express departures would increase thedaily operations of the two Pan Am Corp. subsidiaries to 91.   ``With the growing popularity of Florida as a destination forEuropeans and North and South Americans alike, we are confidentthat the demand for increased capacity provides an advantageoustime for Pan Am Express to enter Florida,'' Plaskett said.   Pan Am Express, purchased by Pan Am Corp. in 1987, currentlyserves 11 cities in the northeastern United States, Los Angeles andSan Diego, as well as 11 European cities.   Its fleet includes 12 50-passenger deHavilland Dash 7 aircraftand 10 44-passenger ATR 42s. Another 13 aircraft already were onorder.   In addition to the 19-seat Jetstream 31 aircraft, the Pan AmExpress order from British Aerospace includes 29-seat Jetstream 41s.   Pan Am will get 10 Jetstream 31s to be delivered in 1990 and 10Jetstream 41s, a new stretch version of the 31, to be delivered in1993. Also, Pan Am has options on an additional 10 of each type ofaircraft.</TEXT></DOC>
