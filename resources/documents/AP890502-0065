Expressions of sorrow and outrage over the death of universityprofessor David Webster came from both blacks and whites, and fromanti-apartheid, academic, labor and student groups across SouthAfrica.   Max Coleman, who worked with Webster in several organizationsopposed to race-segregation, told hundreds of mourners Monday nightat the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, ``There isonly one group that stood to gain from this act: those who arededicated to perpetuating the brutal and vicious system that Daviddedicated his life to opposing.''   White musician Johnny Clegg, whose Zulu-style music has gainedinternational acceptance despite a cultural boycott against SouthAfrica, sent a message of support to the meeting from Los Angeles.   Webster, 44, an anthropology lecturer at Witwatersrand, was shotto death outside his Johannesburg home Monday by an assailantfiring from a passing car.   Colleagues said they had no doubt he was killed because of hispolitical activities. He was a prominent opponent of detentionwithout trial.   Several dozen black activists have been murdered in recentyears. Many white activists have received anonymous threats or havebeen harassed by vandals, but few have been attacked.   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said in a statement: ``Iwant to make it clear on behalf of the government that the murderis strongly condemned and that no stone will be left unturned toapprehend those responsible.''   Tributes to Webster came from a wide range of organizationsopposed broadly to apartheid and specifically to various policiesof the white-led government. The groups assist families ofdetainees, keep records of alleged human rights abuses, object tomilitary conscription and contest eviction of blacks from rentedhouses.   A spokesman for the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conferencesaid Webster's life ``was one of great respect for the humandignity of all people.''   Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the Congress of South AfricanTrade Unions, said the killing ``is a blow to our struggle but itwill only strengthen our determination to uproot and destroyapartheid evils.''   The Detainees Parents Support Committee, banned by thegovernment, said Webster became an authority on forms of staterepression and also patterns of informal repression. ``His workwent a long way to exposing those acting under the cover ofdarkness,'' a statement said.   Under apartheid, the country's 28 million blacks have no vote innational affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
