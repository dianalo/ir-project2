Mario Biaggi and four others of racketeering in the Wedtech corruption scandal.    The verdict against the 10-term Democrat from the Bronx came on the fifth day of deliberations.    The congressman and six others were accused during the four-month trial of turning Wedtech Corp. into a racketeering enterprise that dispensed millions of dollars in bribes to win no-bid government contracts set aside for minority-owned businesses.    The jury rejected arguments that Wedtech didn't need the Democratic congressman because the defense contractor had friends in the Reagan White House, including Attorney General Edwin Meese III.    Mr. Biaggi, 70 years old, was convicted of all but one of 16 counts, including conspiracy, extortion, tax evasion and receiving bribes. He faces up to 20 years in prison on the racketeering counts, the most serious charges. No sentencing date was set.    The former police officer was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in jail and was fined $500,000 in an unrelated case in November for accepting an illegal gratuity and is free on appeal.    The jury yesterday also convicted former Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon, Wedtech founder John Mariotta, former Small Business Administration official Peter Neglia and Biaggi's former law partner, Bernard Ehrlich, all of racketeering.    In addition, U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley ruled that Richard Biaggi, the congressmen's eldest son, had been acquitted of racketeering and conspiracy, but was convicted of two lesser counts. The jury originally announced that the younger Biaggi was convicted of racketeering and conspiracy.    Acquitted of racketeering was Ronald Betso, a former city policeman and friend of Mr. Neglia's.    More than 130 witnesses were called in the trial, including four former Wedtech executives who testified for the government in exchange for leniency. The four admitted bribing public officials, defrauding the government and stealing from the company -- in concert with Mr. Mariotta.    The defense argued that the corrupt Wedtech executives had pull with White House insiders such as Mr. Meese and thus didn't need to bribe Mr. Biaggi. However, Mr. Motley denied a defense request to call Mr. Meese as a witness.    Prosecutors claimed the &quot;Meese defense&quot; was a smokescreen to divert attention from the defendants.    A special prosecutor in Washington has determined there was insufficient evidence to charge Mr. Meese with any wrongdoing -- but he questioned the attorney general's ethics on several issues.    The House Ethics Committee staff recommended in February that Mr. Biaggi be expelled for the earlier conviction, but decided to put off action on the matter until Mr. Biaggi was available to defend himself. </TEXT></DOC>
