The detectors under consideration areincluded into automated systems for power distribution, monitoring andcontrol in nuclear reacor cores. Investigations are performed in theRK-LM in-pile loop operating in the IRT-M reactor. Gamma radiation doserate corresponds to 10/sup 5/ g.eq. of radium. The liquid metal alloycontaining 25% indium+62% gallium+13% tin is used as a gamma source.The detector sensitivity calibration is performed without activationof their structural materials with mean-square error being no more than+-4%. The obtained data show that ionization chamber sensitivity to gammaradiation under reactor and loop conditions agree well enough with eachother. Ionization chamber sensitivity difference from one another makesup no more than 30%. Emission detector sensitivity spread from the meanvalue does not exceed +-10%. 6 refs.; 4 figs.; 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
