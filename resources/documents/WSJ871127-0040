The figure was as much as #40 million under the expectations of some analysts.    Sales, based on currency rates at the end of the quarter, fell 3.5%, to #4.57 billion ($8.19 billion) from #4.74 billion. Net income was unchanged at #187 million.    B.A.IT, which has interests in tobacco, retailing, financial services and paper production, is Britain's biggest non-oil company in terms of revenue.    Currency movements reduced pound-denominated sales by #447 million and operating profit by #24 million, B.A.IT said. Operating profit from its tobacco operations rose 13%, to #231 million from #205 million. B.A.IT said continued growth in Japan compensated for a shrinking market in the U.S.    In the first nine months, pretax profit rose 16%, to #1.02 billion from #882 million, but sales fell 4.2%, to #13.07 billion from #13.62 billion.    Looking ahead, B.A.IT noted the turbulence on world financial markets, which began after the third quarter ended, and said that a &quot;company of this size must be affected by such events, which could have a significant impact on reported results.&quot; But it added that its &quot;business conditions continue to be in good shape, the group has strong liquidity, and it is well-positioned to meet any difficult times with resilience.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
