Also obtained are high moduli and excellentthermal stability and corrosion resistance, with sufficiently high fabricabilityto allow economic production of sheet, extrusion, and forging feedstocksapplicable to a wide range of aerospace applications; these applicationsencompass aircraft primary structures, gas turbine compressors, and missileairframes. 10 references.</TEXT></DOC>
