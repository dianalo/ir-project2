The report documents thefundamental technology development performed by GE-CRD on beta&quot;-aluminasynthesis, forming of electrolyte via electrophoretic deposition, sulfurelectrode materials characterization and design, sodium electrode materialscharacterization and design, sulfur container materials characterizationand process development and electrolyte seal development. The reportevolves this fundamental technology discussion into the development ofthe sodium-sulfur cell as the Program transitioned from the CRD laboratoriesto an Operating Component - Energy Systems Department and eventaullyAdvanced Energy Programs Department. The report addresses the GE utilitycell - the FII - in regards to its design, manufacturing, and performance.Also, the design of a 100 MWh utility load levelling battery utilizingthe FII cell is presented. Recommendations for future development anddesign activities are proposed throughout the report. 75 figs., 38 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
