He said Iraq ``wants to be surethat we are making real, durable and comprehensive peace'' to endthe 8-year-old war.   As he spoke, heavy fighting between Iran and Iraq was reported.   Iran said its forces drove Iraqi troops out of southern Iran andfought Iraq for control of a town in western Iran. Tehran claimed1,200 Iraqis were killed or wounded.   Iraq claimed its forces shot down an Iranian F-5 warplane overthe southern front. Iran said its military shot down two Iraqiwarplanes.   The tough stand by Aziz, who requested the current round ofcease-fire talks, could signal difficult going in the negotiations.   Iran has opposed direct talks, but has left the door open topossible direct contacts if requested by the secretary-general. TheU.N. chief said the talks initially would be separate and he wouldmediate between the two sides.   But he said he preferred direct talks and may request them later.   Perez de Cuellar said today he hoped to be able to announce thedate for a cease-fire next week, along with other dates forimplementation of a U.N. peace plan to end the war.   He also said he would raise the issue of foreign hostages heldby a pro-Iranian faction in Lebanon. ``I think they may asserttheir possible influence in order to have this problem out of theway for both humanitarian and political reason,'' Perez de Cuellarsaid. Nine Americans are among the hostages.   Aziz held a first round of talks this morning for one hour atthe secretary-general's residence near the United Nations. Thesecretary-general's spokesman, Francois Giuliani, said theunannounced meeting was held at Perez de Cuellar's residence for``convenience.''   Aziz and Perez de Cuellar then held a second meeting at U.N.headquarters.   On Tuesday, Iran's foreign minister accused Iraq of trying tosabotage peace efforts with attacks he said involved the use ofchemical weapons.   ``We said (to Perez de Cuellar) that if (the Iraqis) continuetheir attack, we will give them a lesson that they won't forget,''the Iranian minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, said after twice meetingwith the U.N. chief.   Velayati also was to meet today with Perez de Cuellar.   Velayati said he discussed with Perez de Cueller a timetable forimplementing the year-old U.N. cease-fire plan Iran agreed toaccept last week.   ``We also talked about the recent escalation of the war on ourborder with the Iraqis,'' he said.   Perez de Cuellar said he dispensed with formalities and beganpeace talks Tuesday, one day ahead of schedule, because Velayatihad already arrived.   Velayati and Perez de Cuellar discussed implementation ofSecurity Council Resolution 598, which was passed unanimously onJuly 20, 1987 and demands an immediate cease-fire in the Iran-Iraqwar.   The plan also calls for withdrawal to internationally recognizedborders, prisoner exchanges, peace negotiations and aninvestigation to determine which side started the war.   Iraq quickly accepted the resolution last year. Iran'sannouncement of acceptance came after a string of battlefielddefeats that began in the spring.   Before meeting the secretary-general, Velayati told reportersthat Iraq was trying to sabotage the peace process by in the pastweek invading Iran and using chemical weapons ``in a large scale.''   ``The war is still going on very seriously,'' he said, despiteIraq's claim it was withdrawing from all Iranian territory after aweekend offensive.   Velayati said his talks with Perez de Cuellar were``constructive'' and covered the steps to carry out a truce andpeace plan.   Meanwhile, two U.N. teams were at work in Tehran, one laboringover truce details, the other inquiring into the prisoner-of-warsituation. The cease-fire would be monitored and supervised byabout 250 U.N. peacekeeping troops.</TEXT></DOC>
