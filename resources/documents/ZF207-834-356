 They are non-disruptive, helping developers distribute anapplication invisibly.andP;  More interesting is a whole new kind of application(which can be built on top of RPCs): cooperative applications.andP;  This approachlets uses work ad hoc with a group of independent applications, and lets teapplications work with each other.andM;One handy communication mechanism for cooperative applications (as long asthey don't need real-time communication) is E-mail.andP;  E-mail enhanced withuses programming tools and interfaces to common applications and informationsources provides support for end-user development of groupware.andP;  (All thisrequires a very different kind of tool from an RPC compiler, something on theorder of a spreadsheet as opposed to a financial planning language.andP;  Remoteprocedure calls may underlie a mail system, as financial language routinesunderlie spreadsheets, but they aren't visible to most users.)andM;E-mail does not provide the power and seamlessness of remote procedure calls,but it's more accessible and error-tolerant.andP;  There is less advancecoordination required.andP;  Remote procedure calls are synchronous, like phonecalls, whereas E-mail is patient and non-intrusive, and provides astore-and-forward facility which can hold messages until the recipient --person or application -- is ready.andM;Mail modelsandM;There are two budding standards for large-scale E-mail: IBM's SNADS (for SNADistribution Service, which is part of SAA), and the TCP/IP Simple MessageTransfer Protocol, or SMTP, which is evolving toward the formal CCITT X.400standard.andP;  They correspond almost perfectly to SAA and UNIX -- inproprietariness, culture and consistency of implementation.andP;  (DEC's VAXmailis also widely used, just like VAXes.)andM;At the other end of the spectrum is Action Technologies' Message HandlingService, an open standard (you can use the protocol without buying the tools,but your users will need an MHS server from Novell, Action or a licensee).andO;It performs similar functions, but isn't directly comparable: Differences inscale translate into fundamentally different systems.andP;  MHS is local, andworks over local-area networks and asynchronous auto-dial.andP;  X.400 is global,and manages more complex data translation and a worldwide range of addresses...andP;  but it doesn't scale down well and it requires fairly sophisticatednetwork underpinnings (an OSI protocol stack) to operate at all.andP;  &quot;X.400 isto an army tank,&quot; says Soft Switch chairman Mike Zisman, &quot;as MHS is to aVolkswagen.andP;  They're both useful, but for different tasks.&quot; (Presumably,then, SNADS is a private tank.)andP;  All this means good business for Zisman,whose company provides gateways among local-area networks, the variousproprietary enterprise-wide systems such as VAXmail and IBM's PROFS, and theX.400 standard.andM;MHS has been around for a long time as part of Action Technologies' TheCoordinator, and was built as a quick, tidy elegant way for The Coordinatorto handle messages.andP;  Novell encouraged Action to generalize it, and nowoffers it (via a free coupon) as part of every NetWare system sold.andP;  You canalso buy it directly from Action Technologies (see Release 1.0, 86-10, 89-6).andO;Until this year it hasn't had much of a following, but 100 people turned outfor the first-ever MHS developers' conference, including ComputerLand, whichuses MHS to send messages between warehouses to manage inventories and otherdata.andP;  Like all these communication systems, MHS consists of protocols and amessage-handling (server) component.andP;  The primary protocol is an 18-lineASCII file that contains parameters describing where the message should go,whether acknowledgement is required, etc.andP;  At either end, each MHSapplication needs to know how to implement &quot;seal&quot; and &quot;unseal&quot; routines,creating and interpreting the 18-line header.andM;Mail-enabled applicationsandM;These standards are a start.andP;  Now we need interfaces so that they can carrymessages to and from applications, instead of just transmitting files andmessages between people.andM;What would such an E-mail-based system look like?andP;  As it happens, it wouldlook a lot like the MIT Information Lens and Object Lens systems, designedwith grants from Xerox, Wang and DEC among others and running on XeroxD-machines with a UNIX revision underway (see Release 1.0, 86-10 and 88-9).andM;Two start-ups are working on just such a system, with object-oriented usertools, but using more widespread pc platforms.andP;  Both companies have workedwith the MIT project leader, Professor Thomas Malone, and he is co-founderand director of, and consultant to, one of them, Agility Systems.andP;  Malonealso runs MIT's new Center for Coordination Science.andM;Both these systems fill a gap that struck us hard at OOPSLA: Lots ofobject-oriented programmings tools help you design application userinterfaces -- with windows, dialogue boxes, radio buttons, scroll bars -- butnone of them seems to know much about performing tasks, such as composing anddistributing a memo, handling a customer request for a special service orplanning a boss's itinerary.andP;  Nor do they know about programming interfacesto existing applications -- so that you could, say, get data from Dow Jonesor a 1-2-3 file through a nice, user-friendly form, or request an advancethrough a nasty, scary form that asks the name of your first-born.andM;The trick is not to sell object-oriented programming, but to sell anapplication tool.andP;  We need class libraries that include people, resources,tasks, groups and interfaces to applications, as well as screen objects andattached procedures.andP;  E-mail can provide the transport for all this, so thatno one needs to write complex remote procedure calls but can (invisibly) usethose of the mail system, at least for non-realtime applications.andM;All this is very nice, but it requires a fair amount of plumbing-level work.andO;Each client and each server application needs to know about message syntaxand be prepared to look for messages on the mail server each time it isloaded.andP;  (With the RPC approach, by contrast, the server procedure had betterbe there or the client will simply get an error message.)andP;  The breadth ofeach vendor's application-interface library will be an important determinantof success, helped by vendor efforts such as Lotus' DataLens.andM;Compare and contrast: Beyond and AgilityandM;Beyond was founded last year by Chuck Digate, with start-up funds from Lotusstock he acquired as senior vp of analytic software products.andP;  MIT also hasan equity stake in return for a non-exclusive license to its technology.andP;  TheBeyond development team includes people from ON and Ontologic (see Release1.0, 89-9); its board includes Zisman, who sits on no other outside boards.andO;He is excited by Beyond's potential to complement the plumbing systemsSoft.Switch provides, and the chance to &quot;cooperative instead of compete.&quot;andM;Agility was founded this month by John Landry, former evp of development atCullinet, with start-up funds from the sale of his Cullinet stock and asettlement he received in Cullinet's recent acquisition by ComputerAssociates.andP;  Landry promises that full specs of Liaison will be released byyear-end, with shipments to follow shortly.andP;  Agility will be using some asyet unidentified third-party technology to get a kick-start.andM;Neither system is implemented yet, so these descriptions are more thanusually subject to change.andP;  Now read on....andM;Agility's system will be Mac- and PC/Windows-based, while Beyond's will starton the PC, with the Mac to follow.andP;  The Beyond system seems to be focused ongroup information-sharing, while Agility's Liaison will be more concernedwith application integration, but that's a fine distribution.andP;  Both companieswill sit on top of a wide range of mail systems and adhere to standards, theysay, but are a little vague about precisely which ones.andM;Beyond will attack three intertwined information-oriented problems, saysDigate: information overload (with filters, although he won't use the term inmarketing), the restricted reach of information (it's hard to find and tosend), and people's reluctance to communicate (why risk it unless someoneasks?).andP;  In short, Digate sees a world where there's too much information;information is not packaged right to reach its targets; and people arereluctant to add to the mess.andP;  The Beyond product will include an E-mailfront-end (user agent, in E-mail parlance), intelligent agents (i.e.andP;  toolsto build them), an engine that can process messages and trigger agents, and alower-level interface for corporate and independent software developers tointegrate their applications with the system.andP;  Beyond itself will provideinterfaces for a variety of popular applications and formats.andM;While it's hard to compare smoke with mirrors (which is which?), we get thesense that Agility's Liaison, is more focused on the outside world (inkeeping with Landry's mainframe background).andP;  It will include the samegeneral capabilities listed above, but Landry tends to talk about externalinformation services -- Dow Jones, Lexis and Nexis -- while Digate talksabout person-to-person communication and pc applications.andP;  Agility willprovide support for a variety of input styles -- menu selection, phonebuttons, voice, even fax -- to attract non-typing executives.andP;  Landry isexcited about the interconnection of previously incompatible public andprivate mail systems -- MCI, Internet, VAXmail, PROFS, etc.andP;  -- while Digateseems to be focused initially on the closer-to-home issues of effectivecommunication and application integration within a workgroup.andM;In the end, it's a question of focus.andP;  Both systems will ultimately addressworkgroup, enterprise and wide-area communications.andP;  Both will have a userprogramming language and an interface for applications (unfortunately,different ones).andP;  You'll be able to do more or less the same things withelither, but initial positioning will depend on what object libraries andinterfaces each vendor starts with.andM;Fantasy: I'll have my agent call your agentandM;What can you do with either tool?andP;  Well, say Digate and Landry, you can buildpersonal, organization or inter-enterprise applications, or integrate allthree.andP;  The following scenario is our own, and is an example of what youmight build, not what you would get, with either product:andM;Alice might be calling on a new customer, Malleable Metals Corp.andP;  Shebroadcasts a message over the company network asking if anyone has anyinformation on Malleable Metals.andP;  She can't just query the corporate databasebecause (let's be realistic) this kind of information is not yet kept incorporate databases.andP;  On the other hand, this is the kind of message peoplewould normally throw away.andP;  So she sends it in the form of a message thatsays, &quot;If you think you know anyone at Malleable Metals, please press thisbutton to execute a query against your personal database.&quot;andP;  All the receiverhas to do is press the button, and the query is run against a personaldatabase that would normally be off-limits to Alice.andP;  As it happens, Juanthinks he used to know someone at MM, so he presses the button.andP;  A few linesof data, plus a comment about why Jeremy the purchasing manager didn't buy,are automatically sent back to Alice with no further work on Juan's part.andM;Now Alice is set.andP;  She composes a nice letter to Jeremy with an apologeticreference to the product deficiency, now fixed, that provoked his scorn lastyear.andP;  She incorporates some text and diagrams from a corporate database ofproduct information.andP;  She sends a copy of the letter to Juan personally, andto the entire sales department.andP;  Fred, new in the company, reads it avidly,but Henry, an old hand, has programmed his system to ignore any mailaddressed to the sales department -- unless it comes from the sales manager.andO;(Henry may miss a couple of interesting tidbits, and he knows all about MMand would have enjoyed telling Alice so, but that's his problem.)andM;After Alice takes Jeremy to dinner at the Quilted Giraffe, she files herexpense account, using a form developed by the accounting department forcompany-wide use.andP;  The system takes one look at the amount ($300 for dinnerfor two), compares it to her spending limit -- and sends the report to hermanager for review.andP;  He puts it on hold, but releases it to the accountingdepartment for payment (by pushing a button) after a brief chat with Alice.andM;Later on, when alice wins an order from Jeremy, the order form automaticallynotifies her boss as well as the shipping and invoicing groups.andP;  She offersto buy Jeremy a copy of her mail-enabled toolkit and send him her company'sorder interface so that he can place follow-up orders automatically.andP;  If hewants, she'll even offer to query his inventory system periodically, so thathe'll never run out, but it may take a while for her to earn his trust.andP;  Fornow, he's content to place orders when he thinks it's time.andP;  (This is animplementation of EDI, or electronic data interchange, for which a whole setof higher-level standards -- purchasing, ordering and billing transactions --is being developed by ANSI and EDIFACT, a UN-sponsored group.)andM;Behind the scenesandM;All this can be done fairly easily -- If you have the right tools.andP;  Note theuse of messages, forms, filtering and external communications (using somesort of gateway).andP;  End-users can send their own messages, and people such asthose in accounting can create expense-account forms that flow informationdirectly into the general ledger and a special tax-accounting system.andP;  The pcsupport group may get involved in building an EDI ordering system that'sintegrated with the production and shipping departments.andP;  Alice'sword-processor has a couple of extensions that enable her to downloadproperly formatted boilerplate from a corporate text base, and to send copiesof her letters by selecting from a menu integrated into her word-processor.andO;The only time she used the Beyond or Liaison E-mail system directly was whenshe broadcast her message searching for information on Malleable Metals.andP;  Tobuild that request, she selected &quot;fuzzy search&quot; from a menu, added hercriterion (Malleable Metals), and typed an explanation of her request in ashort cover note (an unstructured text field, for those who care).andP;  For eachusers who executed the query at her request, the system translated it intothe proper format for that user's data files.andM;Now, a clever programmer could set this all up today.andP;  However, he or shewould have to do most of the work by hand.andP;  Tools such as Agility's andBeyond's will provide a variety of application-specific interfaces tomanipulate existing applications and their own interface for user-developedapplications, and will use existing transport mechanisms.andP;  Initialapplications will no doubt include automatic calendaring, and a &quot;capture&quot;function that could take almost any data and turn it into an object.andO;Eventually, with a more integrated system, virtually all the data in acompany will have become objects.andP;  In other words, you could accomplish workthrough the system, which &quot;knows&quot; what's going on.andP;  Jeremy, for example, willbe registered as a potential customer; when his order comes through, thesystem gives him some new characteristics as an active customer.andM;NewWave and TogetherandM;It's hardly fair to talk about these two products, whose promises haven'tbeen tested yet, without mentioning Hewlett-Packard's two-year-old NewWave,which is real if not yet complete.andP;  NewWave has approached the problem ofcommunicating applications at the single-workstation level first, with moreconcern for the individual user's operating environment and office automationthan information management.andP;  (It could be a handy environment for Beyond orAgility.)andP;  Specifically, the most noticeable thing about NewWave is itslinking of data files and applications into &quot;objects,&quot; so that users needn'tdeal with them separately.andP;  Beyond that, it provides linking facilities sothat, for example, text, graphical and spreadsheet or database data can beincorporated in a single compound document without losing its character(i.e., each component is an object with its own methods).andP;  NewWave has anumber of standard messages, such as display and print, which are interpretedappropriately by each object.andP;  But the system's agent facility is stilllimited: It's either keystroke capture and replay, with limited support forconditional statements, or a language targeted as MIS types.andM;Yet another approach is that of Together from Coordination Technology (seeRelease 1.0, 88-6), an OS/2-PM-based product due out next year.andP;  It focuseson collaborative task automation and workgroups and has a less ad-hoc,individualistic feel than we expect from Agility and Beyond.andM;An inside viewandM;A major contributor of Agility and Beyond (following the original InformationLens) is semi-structured messages -- forms with both human-oriented text andwith data that the system can use for filtering, routing decisions or togenerate the appropriate message for each application supported.andP;  Some ofthese application messages will be at the keystroke level, while others willbe direct application-to-application communication; it all depends on howeasy it to get inside the third-party applications.andP;  With the exception ofsome databases, most pc applications at present have user interfaces, but notmuch of a programming interface.andM;That's why, as far as we can tell, Agility and Beyond are focusing theirinitial efforts on information-intensive application -- collecting andfiltering information, sending transaction messages to databases, and routingmessages people -- rather than the more-complex, inside-the-applicationefforts that Hewlett-Packard is taking on with NewWave.andM;The NewWave team's goal is to get more and more application vendors toprovide application programming interfaces so that applications can deal witheach other directly rather than pretend to be users, passing identifiedcommands, data sets and parameters rather than keystrokes (i.e.andP;  callingspecific application functions that it &quot;knows&quot; about).andP;  It has spent much ofthe last two years rounding up and forstering support from third-partyapplication vendors, who are tailoring their applications to work withNewWave.andM;The promise of Agility and Beyond is to work form the outside and accomplisheffective integration more quickly through end-user tools for communicationwith and manipulation of a variety of more-open applications -- applicationsthat are targeted to answering queries, executing transactions, and returninglarge volumes of information.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
