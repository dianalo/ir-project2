Louis MacNieceandM;And the arch enemy of TM: What is this life, if full of care We have no timeto stand and stare?andM;Programmers get close to the quintessential paradox of time when they realizethat the nano-second is finite--add enough of them sequentially and you getwhat is known in the trade as &quot;unacceptable response.&quot;andP;  We learn to respectthose epsilons of clockticks and spend weeks shaving cycles.andP;  Our image oftime is a 25MHz crystal rather than Old Father Time rolling along with OldMan River.andP;  We realize, of course, that if you are an electron in orbit (orwhatever they do nowadays), the nanosecond is an eternity, but we are stillhaunted by Zeno's stationary, moving arrow.andP;  Is time infinitely divisible?andO;If so, how do all those zero-length instances add up to blink my cursor andthen press on to make a long winter's night at a terminal?andM;The smallest discussable time period at the moment (sic) is the first10.sup.-43 seconds following the Big Bang, yet apparently much wasaccomplished.andP;  Great planning and TM, no doubt, that should inspire us tomake every cycle pay.andM;The smallest interval in everyday life, the cynics claim, is the time betweenthe traffic lights turning green and the Klaxon hoot from the car behind you.andO;Or perhaps the gap between subscribing to a computer magazine and receiving aletter urging you to renew.andP;  I recall on one occasion getting so mad atByte's hectic requests to renew a subscription that still had five months torun that I ticked the three-year box and sent my check.andP;  Almost by returnmail, I received a note explaining that under the new tax laws pending, asix-year subscription was strongly advised.andM;Physicists use a T in their equations quite remote from our biological clockand its daily scheduling impositions.andP;  Their T ranges from 0 seconds to10.sup.10 years and can even be made to run backward by changing a sign hereand there.andP;  Stephen Hawking has written a best-seller on the subject.andP;  ABrief History of Time (New York, N.Y: Bantam Books, 1988), covering theentire span from T.sub.0 to T.sub.max.andM;However, a New York Times survey revealed that Hawking's book was theleast-read, least-understood best-seller of all time!andP;  Apparently, theAmerican publishers insisted that Professor Hawking remove all obfuscatingmathematical formulae from the book, with the exception of E = mc.sub.2.,andO;which was considered to be well-known and harmless to the general reader'ssynapses.andM;The highlight of the book is Hawking's explanation of why a (3 +1)-dimensional universe (three for space, one for time) is just about rightfor earthlings.andP;  Two-dimensional creatures have a topologically difficult jobingesting food and evacuating waste since a proper digestive tract wouldliterally split them asunder.andP;  In the other direction, having more than threespatial dimensions would play havoc with the force of gravity, leading toplanetary instability.andP;  If other spatial dimensions are lurking, as mooted bythe non-ASCII superstring theorists, they must be incredibly tiny, coy, andwrapped up in themselves.andM;The general reader, unaccustomed to the tricks played by mathematicians, willbe startled by the fact that a point even in our (3 + 1) space-time manifoldis expressed with four coordinates: x, y, z, it, where i is the frightening(to some) and imaginary (the misnomer survives) square root of -- 1.andP;  Theso-called imaginary time axis, however, uses i for purely technical reasons,not because of any mystical properties.andP;  The i helps keep track of events'time components.andP;  A kind of ongoing cosmological TM, perhaps?andM;You may wonder why we have only one time dimension, apart from mollycoddlingthe astrologists and diary manufacturers.andP;  Well, I have an old, battered copyof Sir Arthur Eddington's Mathematical Theory of Relativity (Cambridge, U.K.:andO;Cambridge University Press, 1923), which reveals that a (2 + 2) universe (twospace and two time dimensions) is a perfectly reasonable object formathematical investigation.andM;You may recall Eddington's role in the earliest recorded relativistic joke.andO;Eddington, after giving the first public exposition of Einstein's new theoryin England, was asked by a reporter if it was true that only three people inthe world understood relativity.andP;  Eddington paused for a while, eventuallysaying, &quot;I'm wondering who the other one could be.&quot;andM;Eddington considers the boundary conditions if a real (2 + 2) space-timecontinuum rubbed shoulders with our (3 + 1) version somewhere.andP;  The sumsreveal that no electromagnetic signals could pass in either direction--asituation that will surely ring a bell with most readers.andP;  He concludes thata (2 + 2) universe cannot enjoy spatiotemporal relations with ours, which isa pedantic way of saying that it does not exist.andP;  More precisely, it meansthat if extraterrestrials are struggling with TM on two independent axes, wecan safety ignore them and vice versa.andP;  So, back to our own time and place.andM;One common-sense definition reckons that time prevents everything fromhappening at once.andP;  If this is indeed the intended purpose, then in myexperience time has not been consistently successful.andP;  A certain parallelismintrudes from time to time, prompting the cry that it's all happening hereand now on this very desk.andP;  To counter the assault of parallel problems youneed to develop parallel methods of problem solving, of which delegation ismuch touted but rarely available exactly when needed.andM;As with computing, the difficulty is determining which subtasks can betackled independently and which must await the outcome of an earliersequence.andP;  It is easy to fall for what I call the floss-while-you-are-eatingstrategy.andP;  Borrowing another computing analogy, the time-sharing concept, youcan often service a group of demands in such a speedy, round-robin way thateach demand is tricked into believing it has your undivided attention.andP;  Uponreflection, the ideas of job priority and time slicing are so basic to allhuman activity that they must predate teh multiterminal computer and itstrivial algorithms by countless millenia.andM;The traditional TM solution is learing how to do things more effectively, notonly the obvious elements of planning, scheduling priorities, speed, andefficiency, but also the art of avoiding too many commitments and deadlines.andO;One must not forget, though, that situations arise where the appropriatetime-management strategy involves stretching the job in hand.andM;A bystander, it has been reliably related, was watching a painter paint therailings outside Trinity College, Dublin, Eire.andP;  The painter would dip thebrush in a small tin of paint, walk 50 yards or so to the railings, apply thepaint, then return to the paint tin.andP;  After watching this performance forsome time, the bystander felt compelled to comment: &quot;I say, why don't youcarry the paint tin nearer to where you are painting?andP;  You'd have lesswalking and you could probably paint twice as many railings.&quot;andP;  To which thepainter replied indignantly, &quot;And to be sure, now, there aren't twice as manyrailings to be painted.&quot;andP;  This tale has an obvious moral for managers.andP;  Doesyour staff know what lies beyond the current project?andM;These preoccupations are prompted by my recent adoption of who-what-when, aPC package from Chronos Software subtitled &quot;Software for People, Project, andTime Management,&quot; as my personal deadline-control system.andP;  I will not attemptan objective review of who-what-when since it is the only TM package I havetried.andP;  In fact, until recently, I viewed TM as a rather pompous, obviousobfuscation, the sort of arena where &quot;methods&quot; become &quot;methodologies.&quot;andP;  I hadperhaps been misconditioned by reading about expensive, full-time, six-monthcourses where you learn how to avoid wasting time.andP;  My reaction was that onlythose dropping out after the first day would merit a diploma.andM;Clearly I cannot compete with my fellow COMPUTER LANGUAGE contributors whospecialize in product reviews and comparisons.andP;  Nor can I unroll any of thosefeature charts with vast matrices of side-by-side Yes/No/Optional notations,each carrying several modifying footnotes.andP;  Nor can I provide performancecharts superimposed against the vendors' claims.andP;  The latter should bemeasured in Ghallstones, a benchmark unit independently coined by PeterDufault, myself, and possibly many others.andP;  Whoever claims priority must beatFeb. 16, 1989, when I first publicly defined the Ghallstone during a SoftwareDevelopment '89 lecture before 65 unbribable witnesses.andM;The pleasant thing about who-what-when and its chief programmer, GregPeterson, is a lack of gall and hyperbole.andP;  The package is not a flashy,windows-everywhere affair promising all things to all people, but rather asolid, easy-to-use planning tool for the nontechnical individual or teamusing minimum, character-based PCs or laptops.andP;  It was written usingLogitech's Modula-2 (with a dash of MASM), an interesting choice for whatPeterson calls his &quot;one-man team.&quot;andP;  We often think Modula-2's advantages interms of groups independently developing component implementation modules fora set of communal definition modules.andM;But it's worth remembering that this approach also works for the individualprogrammer with nontrivial projects, allowing you to concentrate on themodule du jour.andP;  The other advantage is the growing number of qualitytoolboxes for Modula-2 so that wheels like B-tree file management do not needreinventing.andP;  Now Peterson is reaping the benefits as the company has gainedsuccess and grown in size over the last two years.andP;  Maintenance, upgrades,and hiring and training are all eased through standardization on a modular,self-documenting language.andP;  I also found it interesting that the Chronosstaff invites users to all their program-planning sessions so that decisionson features receive user input from step one.andM;who-what-when has a simple approach: a single entry of who you are going tomeet or phone, what the meeting is about, and when it is scheduled.andP;  Thethree data areas are then cross-referenced so you can call up on your screenpeople, project, and time views.andP;  The input screens offer a consistent andobvious interface, you can dial your contacts automatically or set popupalarms, and the printed schedules, project lists, and calendars fit nicelyinto the quality &quot;Paperware&quot; binder provided.andP;  My desk is a tad lessuncluttered.andP;  Tomorrow, I will be fully organized.andM;Returning to the subject of time, productivity, and wild claims, Tom Clune ofthe Eye Research Institute in Boston, Mass., has sent me a strange example ofgall taken from a CASE '89 flier: &quot;How do we truly achieve 50 to 100 timesmore productivity in system development though CASE, and how will werecognize when we have achieved it?&quot;andM;Clune immediately dismissed my suggestion that the writer intended a 50% to100% (rather than 5,000% to 10,000%) improvement on the grounds that no onein marketing today would ever admit to a mere doubling of productivity.andP;  Themystery is how one could possibly achieve such improvements without beingimmediately aware of them.andP;  Clune wonders if &quot;there is a special kind ofproductivity, CASE productivity, which is defined as extreme but indetectableproductivity...rather like the curvature of space, which is real andsignificant and yet requires the utmost in human ingenuity to measure.&quot;andM;I hasten to add that the CASE community should not be judged on this singleaberration.andP;  I fully support the aims of CASE: the computer caused the SEcrisis, so the computer will have to help us resolve the SE crisis.andP;  Mysneaking reservation concerning CASE is a semantic one and applies to most ofthe CAxx acronyms for computer-aided or computer-assisted whatever (excludingmy favorite chestnut: CAD for computer-aided delay).andM;In my work with Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing, I meetmany literary research projects where the CAxx part dominates at the expenseof worthy scholastic results.andP;  Theses proudly announce that the number ofrhyming couplets in Romeo and Juliet is 25% higher than in As You Like It.andO;But rather than explore the literary implications, many papers o'erdwell onthe hardware and software problems involved in the counting process.andM;The inappropriateness of elevating the tools above the end product can beseen if we imagine Shakespeare writing not plays but papers on Quill-AssistedDrama (QAD).andP;  And I've forgotten who first suggested a similar down-puttingacronym: TAR for Typewriter-Assisted Research.andM;Every area of human endeavor that can be computerized should be, is being,and will be.andP;  The CA tag becomes superfluous, tedious pedantry stretchingfrom CAC (Computer-Aided Computing) to CA(CAC), since CAC clearly needs to beComputer Assisted, and so on.andP;  That's begged enough questions for one column.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
