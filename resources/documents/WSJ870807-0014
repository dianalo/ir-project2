The move &quot;will reduce overhead and support expenses in the face of tight aviation markets and increased costs&quot; and is intended &quot;to enhance Beech's performance, which so far in 1987 has resulted in a loss,&quot; Beech said.    Beech, based in Wichita, Kan., makes small aircraft. Raytheon also makes missiles, defense electronics, major appliances and other products. Last year, Beech accounted for $868 million, or 12%, of Raytheon's $7.3 billion sales.    Raytheon's stock closed yesterday at $81.75, up 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
