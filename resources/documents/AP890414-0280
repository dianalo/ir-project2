The former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier also wasordered to post a $1 million bond and surrender his passport inexchange for his freedom until an expected trial later this yearculminating Wall Street's insider trading scandals.   Prosecutors said the agreement to place $600 million in accountsto be monitored by the government was believed to be the largestpretrial asset restraint ever under federal racketeering statutes.   ``The defendants not only contest the indictment but theyseriously, expressly contest the government's theories onforfeiture,'' Arthur L. Liman, Milken's attorney, said at thehearing in Manhattan federal court.   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood turned down a government requestthat Milken post an additional $250 million in bail money, sayingthe 42-year-old former broker was unlikely to flee the countrybefore a trial.   In addition, Milken's brother Lowell, who also faces fraud andracketeering charges, agreed to set aside $50 million in assets andalso was ordered to post a $1 million bond secured by other assetsby Monday.   The Milkens left the courthouse to applause from dozens ofsupporters who attended the hearing, including some wearing capsreading ``Mike Milken: We Believe In You.'' The brothers did notcomment.   The Milkens and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg werecharged with defrauding clients through insider trading and stockmanipulation in a 98-count indictment handed up March 29.   The racketeering charges seek $1.85 billion in forfeitures fromeach man, and they could be forced to pay double that in fines ifconvicted.   Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act,the government could have frozen all of the defendants' assets toensure they wouldn't liquidate them or transfer ownership inanticipation of a guilty verdict.   Instead, prosecutors and defense lawyers hammered out a bondpackage that requires Michael Milken to place $300 million cash inan account to be monitored by the government and to sign a notesecuring $300 million more in less liquid assets.   He is not prohibited from making investments or otherwisemanaging his money.   Milken also will have to surrender the gains from his holdingsin Drexel _ which total 6 percent of the investment firm and areestimated at about $100 million _ as soon as the firm's settlementof separate civil charges with the Securities and ExchangeCommission officially takes effect.   ``In substance, your honor, we expect the security forforfeiture in this case will amount to $700 million,'' AssistantU.S. Attorney John K. Carroll said.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird, who heads the officesecurities and commodities fraud section, said the restraints werethe largest for a securities case and likely the largest ever.   ``I don't know of one with numbers like this,'' he said.   The Drexel-SEC deal, announced Thursday, resolves a range ofcharges and forces the nation's fifth-largest investment firm todismiss Milken, sever all business dealings with him and make himrelinquish his Drexel holdings. The firm also will be subject torigorous federal supervision for three years.   Milken, who reportedly made more than $1 billion between 1983and 1987, under the deal also is barred from transferring anyassets out of the country and must gradually sell assets to convertthe $300 million note to cash.   Carroll sought $250 million in bail, claiming the potentialracketeering forfeiture ``gives (the Milkens) powerful incentive toabsent themselves should they choose to do so.''   ``Should they flee to someplace where they could not beextradited, they could live comfortably the rest of their lives,''he told the judge.   Liman asked Wood to free Milken without bail, saying he was a``homebody'' who posed no threat to leave the country. If theMilkens had sought to flee, they would have done so long ago, theirattorneys said.   Wood said the brothers, who both have lived near Los Angelesmost of their lives, were unlikely to flee but she set the $1million bail because of the scope of the indictment and the assetretention package.   The probe of Drexel and Milken is based in large part oninformation by jailed inside trader Ivan Boesky, whose revelationsstunned Wall Street in 1986. Boesky has completed one year of athree-year jail term.   ``The one thing you can bet on is that our clients are going tobe in court,'' Liman said. ``There is nothing that will keep themfrom coming to this court and confronting Boesky.''   Newberg, who also faces a racketeering indictment in a relatedcase, agreed to set aside $1.6 million in assets. He has yet notbeen arraigned because of a skiing injury and no bail terms wereset.   Michael Milken has been the main target of the government'scrackdown on white-collar crime. He is widely credited withreshaping corporate America in the 1980s through the sale ofhigh-yield junk bonds from Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., office.</TEXT></DOC>
