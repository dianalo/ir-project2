Background</ITAG>The Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) designated the category of halogenatedalkyl epoxides for priority testing consideration in its Second Report,published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 19, 1978 (43 FR 16684). HFPO was oneof seven chemical substances (chemicals) in the category of halogenatedalky epoxides. The ITC recommended that halogenated alkyl epoxides be consideredfor testing for oncogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, and other chroniceffects. The ITC also recommended that epidemiology studies be considered.The other six chemicals in this category were: Epichlorohydrin (ECH), 1,1,1-trichloro-2,3-epoxy-propane(TCPO), 1,4-dichloro-2,3-expoxybutane (DCBO), tetrafluoroethylene oxide(TFEO), 1,1,1-trichloro-3,4 expoxybutane (TCBO), and 1-bromo-2,3-expoxybutane(EBH). The ITC's recommendations were based on high production levels forone member of this category (500 million pounds per year for ECH), a NationalInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) estimate of 50,000to 140,000 workers exposed to ECH each year, an expected increase in theuse of other halogenated alkyl epoxides, and limited studies on the oncogenic,mutagenic, teratogenic, and other chronic effects of members of this categoryof substances. After considering all the available information on the category of halogenatedalkyl epoxides, EPA responded to ITC's recommendation by issuing a proposedrule, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of December 30, 1983 (48 FR 57686), which wouldrequire oncogenicity, mutagenicity, and reproductive effects testing forHFPO under the authority of section 4(a)(1)(A) of TSCA. EPA took this actionbecause chemicals that are structurally similar to HFPO (i.e., ECH) havedemonstrated oncogenic, mutagenic, and reproductive activity in animalsand EPA believed there was the potential for HFPO to elicit similar effects,and because monitoring data indicated there was workplace exposure to HFPO(Ref. 1). In addition, reduced spermatogenesis was observed in a subchronicstudy on HFPO, suggesting that HFPO may produce reproductive effects (Ref.2).In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of December 30, 1983 (48 FR 57695), EPA alsopublished a ``decision not to test'' the other six chemicals in the categoryof halogenated alkyl epoxides. EPA decided that testing of ECH was notnecessary because there are already sufficient data available on this chemical.EPA decided that the testing of TCPO, DCBO, and TFEO was not appropriatebecause none of these three Chemicals are listed on the TSCA inventoryand thus are subject to review under TSCA section 5(a) before they aremanufactured for uses under TSCA Jurisdiction. In the case of TCBO andEBH, EPA found that TCBO is not being manufactured, imported, or processedand EBH is being produced in quantities of 25 pounds or less solely forresearch and development.The proposed rule contained a chemical profile of HFPO. Specific data onthe quantity of HFPO produced annually and the number of workers employedduring its production and processing were claimed to be confidential businessinformation (CBI). EPA found the annual production of HFPO to be relativelylow and the number of workers employed to be relatively few.During the comment period following the publication of the HFPO proposedrule, EPA received manufacturing and processing design, industrial hygiene,and engineering control information from E.I. Du Pont De Nemours andamp;Company (Du Pont), the sole manufacturer and processor of HFPO in the UnitedStates (Ref. 3). Du Pont summarized its HFPO operation as follows: Theentire HFPO manufacturing process is carried out in a totally closed andautomated system; all process vents are scrubbed with caustic before beingdischarged to the atmosphere; before any piping breaks are made, processmaterials are evacuated through a caustic scrubber; protective equipment(acid suit with air supplied helmet) is required when making all pipingbreaks (e.g., sampling); the presence of HFPO in the exhaust air is monitoredusing a Miran IR Analyzer; and all HFPO produced is used in the productionof fluorinated substances and is not present in free form after processing.Based on analysis of the information submitted by Du Pont, EPA believesthat exposure to HFPO in the workplace is being controlled to levels whichare not expected to present an unreasonable risk of adverse health effectseven if the adverse effects for which it is suspected based on analogyto ECH are verified. The monitoring data from HFPO manufacturing and processingsites showed that concentrations of HFPO in the workplace are generallybelow 0.1 parts per million (ppm), which was the limit of detection, andin no case above 2 ppm.Furthermore, EPA has also issued a combined TSCA significant new use rule(SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) and section 8(a) reporting rule for HFPO,published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of October 27, 1987 (52 FR 41296). The SNUR forHFPO will ensure that EPA is notified if HFPO is manufactured, imported,or processed for any use other than as an intermediate in the manufactureof fluorinated substances in an enclosed process. Because the SNUR willnot provide notification of future manufacturing, importing, and processingactivities associated with HFPO's current use, EPA has required reportingunder section 8(a) if HFPO activities not covered by the SNUR are initiated.These rules will allow EPA to track the use of HFPO and to investigatethe health and environmental impacts of such activities.EPA is issuing this notice to terminate the proposed test rule for HFPObecause: EPA believes that Du Pont is presently controlling the exposureto HFPO in the workplace to levels which are not expected to present anunreasonable risk of health effects; and EPA has issued the combined SNUR/section8(a) rule for HFPO to be used as a mechanism to monitor any increases inexposures to HFPO in the future. EPA may reconsider the need for testingof HFPO at that time.<ITAG tagnum="84">II.
