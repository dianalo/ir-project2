McCarthy</HL><DD> 02/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TAXES </IN><TEXT>   Fund-raisers were trumpeting 1986 a few months ago as the taxpayer's last golden year for giving. They urged people to give to charity before the &quot;abominable&quot; tax law took effect.    A few months later, the new law is here, and guess what: It is still a good time to come to the aid of your favorite charity.    In fact, some donors can save more on taxes this year, when the law is being phased in, than they did last year. And giving in 1987 can return greater savings than giving next year.    Charitable deductions will be all the more significant this year because many other deductions were eliminated, the capital gains tax was boosted and various popular tax shelters were dismantled.    Also, because the tax rates drop permanently next year, 1987 is the last year to take advantage of sliding rates.    &quot;I don't know what fund-raisers can stress next year,&quot; says Charles Lawson, a fund-raising consultant. &quot;I think 1987 is their last shot.&quot;    As for 1987, tax advisers and fund-raisers stress the same strategies as last year: Make bigger donations while tax rates are higher. Give appreciated property, such as real estate or securities, instead of cash. Set up charitable trusts.    Nonetheless, while some donors can find fruitful ways to save taxes under the new law, others may come up with lemons. Donations won't be deductible, for instance, for filers who don't itemize.    Still, that's about the most severe restriction. Although the tax impact of giving varies from donor to donor, contributing is still valuable for the majority of taxpayers in 1987.    For people who postponed charitable gifts last year because they anticipated a higher tax rate in 1987, this could be the time to dash off donations. For example, a high-income individual whose rate last year was cut to 20% through tax shelters may get booted into the 38.5% category this year because of reduced deductions for those shelters.    Also, after falling next year, marginal rates aren't scheduled to change. As a result, tax advisers recommend that people who planned to make charitable donations in the next few years consider lumping some together this year.    People in the top tax brackets have the most to gain from giving this year rather than next year and after. The higher the marginal tax rate, the higher the tax saving from a donation. A $10,000 cash gift made this year by a married couple with a marginal tax rate of 38.5% will generate tax savings of $3,850. Next year, when the couple's rate drops to 33%, their savings will be only $3,300.    Appreciated property will be the darling of donations, many fund-raisers say. &quot;It's going to be the best giving vehicle possible,&quot; says Robert L. Thompson, chairman of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel. &quot;I think many donors will have stock portfolios strictly for giving purposes.&quot;    The law changed little regarding such gifts. Donors of securities and valuables that have appreciated still can deduct their full fair-market value, and the ceiling on the gifts remains 30% of the donor's adjusted gross income.    But the new treatment of capital gains gives appreciated property an added bonus, fund-raisers say. By giving an asset, donors still avoid the capital gains tax they would have to pay if they sold it. That benefit has made property gifts cheaper than equal gifts of cash. The benefit is amplified by the new law, which boosts the capital gains tax rate in 1987 to 28% from 20% last year. (In 1988, capital gains lose all preferential treatment and are taxed as ordinary income, albeit at lower ordinary-income rates.)    For some middle-income taxpayers, the after-tax cost of a gift of appreciated property may be lower this year than it was in 1986, say researchers Gerald E. Auten of Bowling Green State University and Gabriel Rudney of Yale University. The savings that result from avoiding this year's higher capital gains tax are even greater than the benefits of 1987's lowered tax rates.    For example, a donor couple filing a joint return who were in the 38% bracket last year fall into the 35% bracket this year, when the long-term capital gains tax rises to 28%. If they give property that has appreciated 50%, their after-tax cost in 1987 will be 51 cents for each dollar given; the same appreciated-property gift last year would have cost them 54 cents for each dollar's worth of donation. The cost reductions are welcomed lures to fund-raisers girding to capture donors.    But in the chorus of praise for property gifts, the one sour note comes from the alternative minimum tax, toughened by the new tax law. Taxpayers don't like to pay it, and fund-raisers don't like to talk about it. One fund-raising group told members in a memo: &quot;Wherever possible, avoid even discussing the AMT.&quot;    Beginning this year, the appreciation on property being donated may subject a taxpayer to the alternative minimum tax, boosting the cost of the gift. Most donors won't be affected by the minimum tax, tax advisers say, but the likelihood of triggering the tax climbs as the size of the gift grows. One way to escape the minimum tax, therefore, is to spread large gifts over several years, Mr. Auten says.    There are other advantages of long-term planning, says Stanley S. Weithorn, a senior tax partner at Baer Marks andamp; Upham in New York. He plans to set up for several clients what are called &quot;charitable lead&quot; trusts.    Here's how the trusts work: A donor puts assets in a trust this year and picks a charity to receive a specified amount of the trust's income for a certain period. The donor eventually gets the assets back. The donor also obtains an immediate deduction -- when current higher tax rates make deductions worth more -- equal to the value in 1987 dollars of the total income the charity will receive.    An executive in the 38.5% bracket in 1987 who sets up a five-year lead trust to generate annual income of $21,000 -- before adjusting for projected inflation -- obtains an immediate tax saving of about $31,000. By contrast, if a second donor in the same tax bracket contributed the same $21,000 in cash for each of the five years, the tax saving would total around $29,000.    While at first that isn't a big difference, the &quot;lead trust&quot; donor then can invest a much larger chunk of the tax savings up front, earning more than the other donor. At the end of the five years, if both donors invest their tax savings in the same 7% tax-exempt securities, the &quot;lead trust&quot; donor will have accumulated about $43,000; the other donor, around $32,000.    &quot;For the same donation,&quot; says Mr. Weithorn, &quot;that's a big difference.&quot;    ---   Mr. McCarthy is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Chicago bureau.    ---                   Giving Appreciated Property   Donor's per-dollar after-tax cost for a gift of propertythat has appreciated 50%.
