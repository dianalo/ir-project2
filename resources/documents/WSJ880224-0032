The amount wasn't estimated. The company blamed expenses from Western U.S. grocery operations that it is in the midst of selling.    The Detroit-based grocery chain predicted that it would sell its 61-store Farmer Jack supermarkets in five Western states at book value. But Borman's said proceeds of the sale wouldn't cover operating losses from the Western chain and closing costs from its sale.    Any fourth-quarter loss would only deepen Borman's losses for the year. Through the nine months ended Nov. 7, Borman's reported losses of $13.1 million on sales of $959.8 million.    In the year-earlier fourth quarter, Borman's earned $3.1 million, or $1.10 a share, on sales of $274 million.    Borman's said yesterday that it signed agreements to sell 21 of its 61 stores in Idaho, Utah and Wyoming to retailers affiliated with Fleming Cos., a Topeka, Kan.-based wholesaler. Albertson's Inc., a Boise, Idaho, supermarket concern, purchased another eight Farmer Jack supermarkets in the three states. The companies didn't disclose the sales price of the 29 stores.    Borman's said negotiations are continuing for the sale of the remaining 32 Western stores. Last April, Borman's paid $75 million for 60 Safeway Stores Inc. supermarkets in the Western states. It later added another store to the chain.    But the stores never worked out, according to Paul Borman, president of Borman's. &quot;The (Western) division hasn't performed up to expectations, and there have been some difficulties created by the distance between our Michigan headquarters and the Western stores,&quot; Mr.Borman said in a prepared release. &quot;Recent studies indicate that a successful turnaround would require a larger financial commitment than was originally anticipated.&quot;    Borman's stock fell 12.5 cents to close at $11.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after yesterday's announcement of the expected loss. </TEXT></DOC>
