Background</ITAG>As a result of the recognition of AIDS and the identification of the etiologicagent, HIV-1 (formerly known as human T-lymphotropic virus type III andlymphadenopathy associated virus), there has been extensive interest inthe development of in vitro diagnostic tests for detecting evidence ofinfection with the virus.Tests utilizing enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) and Western blot technologiesfor detecting antibody to HIV-1 have been approved by FDA. Nine manufacturerscurrently hold licenses issued under section 351 of the Public Health ServiceAct (the PHS act) (42 U.S.C. 262) for the test reagent to be used in testsystems to detect antibody to HIV-1 in human serum and plasma samples.The test is used as an aid in the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection and forscreening blood. In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of January 5, 1988 (53 FR 111), FDA publisheda final rule requiring that each unit of human blood and blood componentsintended for transfusion or for use in preparing a product be tested andfound negative by an approved HIV-1 antibody test.In 1986 and 1987, FDA received several submissions under section 510(k)of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360(k)),notifying the agency of manufacturers' intent to market blood collectionkits labeled for HIV-1 antibody testing. Such blood collection kits fornonprofessional use have sometimes been referred to as ``AIDS home testkits.'' The proposed blood collection kits provide instructions and equipmentfor sample collection, packaging for shipment of the sample to a laboratoryfor HIV-1 antibody testing and a confidential mechanism for receiving theresults of testing.In receiving the manufacturers' submissions, FDA agreed with the manufacturersthat these blood collection kits are medical devices subject to the act.However, FDA determined that blood collection kits labeled for HIV-1 antibodytesting are not substantially equivalent to devices marketed prior to May28, 1976, or to devices classified as class I or II since that date, andtherefore are classified by statute in class III and are subject to premarketapproval under section 515 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e). FDA has since receivedapplications for premarket approval and numerous inquiries concerning themarketing of these blood collection kits.In March 1988, FDA began to notify applicants for premarket approval ofhome blood collection kits that the agency was limiting the marketing ofblood collection kits at this time to those intended for professional useonly. FDA's response to the applications and inquiries was developed throughconsultation with the Public Health Service and private sector advisorygroups. Under FDA's policy on these kits, applications for premarket approvalare accepted only when they meet the following criteria:1. Kits are labeled and marketed for professional use only within a healthcare environment (e.g., hospitals, medical clinics, doctor's offices, sexuallytransmitted disease clinics, HIV-1 counseling and testing centers, andmental health clinics;2. Kits provide for the collection of a venipuncture or other appropriatelyvalidated sample by one who is recognized by a State or local authorityto perform such procedures;3. The testing sequence for all samples collected with the kits includesuse of a licensed screening test for HIV-1 antibody and, for those samplestesting positive by the screening test, the use of an additional more specifictest (i.e., Western blot or comparable test). It is recommended that alicensed test which is more specific for HIV-1 antibody be utilized. However,the agency may accept a properly validated unlicensed test until licensedtests are more widely available;4. The instructions for sample collection, storage, shipping, and testingconform with, or are validated as the equivalent to, the package insertinstructions for the specific licensed HIV-1 antibody test kid used totest samples; and5. All results of testing are reported directly to a professional healthcare provider for reporting and interpretation of the result to the personrequesting the test, as well as for counseling of the individual.As with any new product, FDA expects that some developmental phase willbe needed. If a blood collection kit labeled for HIV-1 antibody testingis developed according to the criteria in 1 through 5 above and to therequirements of 21 CFR 809.10(c), an investigational device exemption (IDE)pursuant to 21 CFR Part 812 will not be required during the developmentalstages of the kit. (See also 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3).)If a blood collection kit labeled for HIV-1 antibody testing is developedunder an investigation not incorporating the criteria in 1 through 5 above,FDA views the investigation as requiring an IDE.A kit for testing at home to detect HIV-1 antibody would include a biologicalproduct as defined under section 351 of the PHS act. A manufacturer orsponsor investigating or developing such a kit would be required to havean approved investigational new drug application (IND) and the kit wouldbe subject to licensure under the PHS act.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Public Meeting Topics </ITAG>The public meeting will provide a forum to discuss FDA's policy describedabove, the following topics, and other topics that may be suggested later:A. Topic 1: Blood Collection Kits 1. <T3>Collection and shipping of blood samples by laypersons. </T3>Impropersample collection, preparation, and shipment could adversely affect theaccuracy of HIV-1 antibody test results. In addition, it is possible, althoughmost unlikely, that improper sample collection and transport might resultin transmission of infection or injury. Therefore, comments are solicitedon the ability of laypersons to safely and adequately collect and packagethese samples for shipment. 2. <T3>Return of test results directly to the person from whom the samplewas collected. </T3>Some manufacturers have proposed systems in which theHIV-1 antibody test results would be returned directly to the person fromwhom the sample was collected. The results of in vitro diagnostic testsoften require interpretation (e.g., under what circumstances false-negativeor false-positive results might occur) and must be integrated into an overallassessment of a person's medical status. Before returning the results oftesting for evidence of infection with HIV-1 to any person other than ahealth professional, adequate instructions for interpretation of the testresults would have to be developed. Comments are solicited on whether suchinformation could be adequately provided.  3. <T3>Counseling outside of a medical health care environment. </T3>Thistopic is related to the issue of proper interpretation of and followupon test results. There is agreement among medical experts that adequatecounseling regarding the test results should be part of HIV-1 testing.Comments are solicited regarding the ability to provide effective pre-and post-test counseling in a setting outside the health care environment.4. <T3>Availability of blood collection systems. </T3>The availability ofblood collection systems as over-the-counter (OTC) devices could increasethe number of samples tested by making systems more readily available.Comments are solicited on whether blood collection systems should be availableas OTC devices. B. Topic 2: Kits for Collection and Home Testing of Blood for Evidenceof HIV-1 Infection Some have discussed the possibility of developing test kits with whichlaypersons could not only obtain their own specimen at home, but also performtesting for evidence of HIV-1 infection. FDA invites comments on issuesrelated to these types of kits. Such issues would include whether the kitsshould be made available OTC, whether laypersons can reliably and safelyperform the test, whether laypersons can adequately interpret the testresults, and whether that interpretation in the absence of a medical professionalis appropriate. The agenda of the public meeting will provide an opportunity for all interestedpersons to make their views known to FDA and to allow thorough discussionof the issues. However, FDA requests that interested persons intendingto make formal presentations notify the information contact person (identifiedabove) no later than March 30, 1989, so that the available time may beallotted among the persons making the requests.Interested persons may submit written comments or requests for a copy ofthe agenda for the meeting to the Dockets Management Branch (address above).Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individualsmay submit one copy. Comments on matters discussed in this notice and presentedat the meeting or written comments received by May 5, 1989, will be consideredin developing a final policy. Comments and requests for an agenda are tobe identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading ofthis document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Frank E.
