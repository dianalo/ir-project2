Biggins at theabove address (704/259-0321 or FTS 672-0321).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The cracking pearly mussel (<T3>Hemistena </T3>(=<T3>Lastena</T3>) <T3>lata</T3>) was initially described by Rafinesque (1820). This freshwatermussel has a thin, medium-size, elongated shell (Bogan and Parmalee 1983).The shell's outer surface is brownish green to brown and often has brokendark green rays. The nacre (inside of shell) color is pale bluish to purple.Because of its rarity, little is known of the mussel's biology. The speciesinhabits moderate-size streams on gravel riffles where it is often deeplyburied in the substrate (Bogan and Parmalee 1983). Like other freshwatermussels, it feeds by filtering food particles from the water. It has acomplex reproductive cycle in which the mussel larvae parasitize fish.The mussel's life span, fish species its larvae parasitize, and other aspectsof its life history are unknown. The cracking pearly mussel has undergone a substantial range reduction.It was historically distributed in the Ohio, Cumberland, and TennesseeRiver systems (Stansbery 1970, Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission 1980,Bogan and Parmalee 1983, Bates and Dennis 1985). The loss of populationsoccurring in these river systems was probably due to direct impacts ofimpoundments, pollution, and habitat alteration and the indirect impactsassociated with the reduction or elimination of its larval host speciesby these same factors. Based on personal communications with knowledgeablemussel experts (Steven Ahlstedt and John Jenkinson, Tennessee Valley Authority,1987; Arthur Bogan, Philadelphia Academy of Sciences, 1987; Richard Neves,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 1987; David Stansbery,Ohio State University, 1987) and a review of current literature on thespecies (see above plus Ahlstedt 1986), the species is definitely knownto survive in only three river reaches_the Clinch River, Hancock County,Tennessee, and Scott County, Virginia; the Powell River, Hancock County,Tennessee, and Lee County, Virginia; and the Elk River, Lincoln County,Tennessee. Although the species has not been collected in the Green River since 1966,and a survey of the Green River in Hart and Edmonson Counties in 1987 failedto collect the species, there is a possibility that an isolated populationmay still exist in the Green River (Richard Hannan, Kentucky Nature PreservesCommission, personal communication, 1988). Another small population mayalso still exist in the Tennessee River below Pickwick Dam in Hardin County,Tennessee (Paul Yokley, Jr., University of North Alabama, personal communication,1988). Live specimens have not been taken below Pickwick Dam since the1970s, but a few relict shells have been taken in the 1980s, indicatingthat a small population may still be holding on in a short reach of theTennessee River.All of the known populations and the populations that may exist in theGreen and Tennessee Rivers are threatened, and are located in areas borderedprimarily by private lands. The Powell River is severely threatened bythe impacts of coal mining. The Clinch River, although in much better condition,is also impacted by coal mining and in the past has experienced extensivefish and mussel kills caused by toxic spills from a riverside power plant.The Elk River mussel fauna has been impacted by cold-water discharges fromTims Ford Reservoir, and the Green River has had a history of water qualityproblems from oil and gas production in the watershed. The Tennessee Riverbelow Pickwick Dam has been impacted by gravel dredging, channel maintenancework and the upstream reservoir. The cracking pearly mussel was recognized by the Service in the May 22,1984, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(49 FR 21664) as a species that was being consideredfor possible addition to the Federal List of Endangered and ThreatenedWildlife and Plants. This mussel was then placed in category 2 on thiscandidate list. Category 2 is for those species for which the Service hassome information indicating that the taxa may be under threat, but sufficientinformation is lacking to prepare a proposed rule. The Service has metand been in phone contact with various Federal and State agency personnelconcerning the species' status and the need for the protection providedby the Endangered Species Act. On January 14, 1988, and May 16, 1988, theService also notified appropriate Federal, State. and local governmentalagencies by mail that a status review was being conducted and that thespecies might be proposed for listing. Nine written comments were received.The National Park Service provided distributional data. The States of Virginia,Kentucky, and Indiana and an interested scientist responded with distributionand threat data and were supportive of the species' being protected underthe Act. The Tennessee Valley Authority and the State of Tennessee supportedour efforts to review the species' status. No negative comments were received.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal list. A species may be determined to be an endangered orthreatened species due to one or more of the five factors described insection 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the cracking pearlymussel are as follows: A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range. </T3>The cracking pearly mussel was once fairlywidely distributed in the Ohio River basin. It ranged in the Ohio Riverfrom Ohio downstream to Illinois (Bogan and Parmalee 1983). In Indianaand Illinois it was historically known from the White, Wabash, and TippecanoeRivers (Kevin Cummings, Illinois State Natural History Survey Division,and Max Henschen, Mollusk Technical Advisory Committee, personal communications,1988) Kentucky records (Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission 1980: RichardHannan, Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission, personal communication, 1988)show that the species once inhabited the upper Cumberland, Big South Fork,Green, and Kentucky Rivers. The cracking pearly mussel has historicallybeen taken in Tennessee from the Tennessee, Cumberland, Powell, Clinch,Holston, Elk, Duck, and Buffalo Rivers (Bogan and Parmalee 1983, Ahlstedt1986, Bates and Dennis 1985) In Alabama, this mussel existed in the TennesseeRiver (Bogan and Parmalee 1983). Portions of the Powell, Clinch, and HolstonRivers in Virginia are also reported to have supported the species (Boganand Parmalee 1983; Charles Sledd, Virginia Department of Game and InlandFisheries, and Michael Lipford, Virginia Department of Conservation andHistoric Resources, personal communications, 1988) Based on a literature review (see above) and personal contacts with knowledgeableFederal, State, and independent biologists, the species is presently knownto be surviving only in the Clinch River. Hancock County, Tennessee, andScott County, Virginia; the Powell River, Hancock County, Tennessee, andLee County, Virginia; and the Elk River, Lincoln County, Tennessee. Thespecies may also still survive in the Green River, Hart and Edmonson Counties,Kentucky (Richard Hannan, personal communication, 1988), and in a shortreach of the Tennessee River below Pickwick Dam, Hardin County, Tennessee(Paul Yokley, Jr., personal communication, 1988). The Powell River's population was sampled in 1979 by the Tennessee ValleyAuthority (Ahlstedt 1986). They surveyed 78 sites over about 97 river milesand found the cracking pearly mussel at only three sites. The Powell Riverwatershed is mined extensively for coal, and coal mining impacts to theriver are evident. The upper reaches of the Powell River are significantlyimpacted. The lower river reaches, which still contain a relatively diversemussel fauna, have large deposits of coal fines and silt (Ahlstedt 1986).In 1973 the section of the Powell River inhabited by the cracking pearlymussel experienced a mussel kill that may have resulted in a loss of 5percent of the mussel population (Ahlstedt and Jenkinson 1987).The Clinch River population of the cracking pearly mussel is the largestand covers the greatest river length. Ahlstedt (1986) reported the speciesfrom 16 of the 141 sites sampled in a 1978-83 Tennessee Valley Authoritysurvey that covered about 174 river miles. Although this river and itsmussel fauna are apparently healthier than the Powell, the Clinch Riverdoes have environmental degradation problems. Charles Sledd (Virginia Commissionof Game and Inland Fisheries, personal communication, 1988) stated thatland use practices along the Clinch have contributed to the loss of waterquality and decline in mussel populations. The Clinch River also experiencessome impacts from coal mining, and the river has been subjected to twomussel kills that resulted from toxic substance spills from a riversidecoal-fired power plant. The cracking pearly mussel was taken at only two of 108 sites over the172 miles of the Elk River surveyed in 1980 by the Tennessee Valley Authority(Ahlstedt 1986). This river, according to Ahlstedt (1986), has a considerableamount of suitable habitat for freshwater mussels, and a large number ofrelic shells was present. However, Ahlstedt (1986) reported that cold-waterreleases from Tims Ford Reservoir and pollution from an unknown sourcein the lower Elk River have impacted the mussel fauna, and mussel densityhas been reduced. The cracking pearly mussel has not been taken since 1966 from the GreenRiver, and a 1987 mussel survey did not find the species (Ronald Cicerello,Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission, personal communication, 1988). However,suitable habitat appears to be available in the Green River, and an isolatedpopulation may still exist there (Richard Hannan, personal communication,1988). In the Tennessee River live specimens were taken in the 1970s, butonly relic shells have been taken in recent years. According to personalcommunication with Dr. Paul Yokley, Jr., (1988), this species, which apparentlyexisted only in small numbers in this river reach, could possibly stillsurvive there. If populations still persist in the Tennessee River below Pickwick Damin Tennessee and the Green River in Kentucky, these populations are alsoat risk. The Green River's mussel fauna has also been seriously depleted.Ortmann (1926) reported finding 66 species of mussels in the Green River.Isom (1974) reported only 27 species present. The Green River has beendegraded by oil and gas exploration and production and by alterations ofstream flow from an upstream reservoir. Any population below Pickwick Damin the Tennessee River is potentially threatened by gravel dredging, channelmaintenance, and operation of Pickwick Dam. This river reach also experienceda mussel die-off in 1985 and 1986 (Ahlstedt and Jenkinson 1987). B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes. </T3>This freshwater mussel species is not commercially valuable,but because of its rarity it could be sought by collectors. Thus, becauseof the species' restricted range, taking could be a threat to its continuedexistence. Federal listing would help control any indiscriminate takingof individuals. C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>Although the cracking pearly mussel is undoubtedlyconsumed by predatory animals, there is no evidence that predation threatensthe species. However, freshwater mussel die-offs, possibly due to disease,have been reported in recent years throughout the Mississippi River basin,including the Tennessee River and its tributaries (Ahlstedt and Jenkinson1987) Significant losses have occurred to some populations. D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3>The States ofKentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia prohibit taking fish and wildlife, includingfreshwater mussels, for scientific purposes without a State collectingpermit. However, these States' laws do not protect the species' habitatfrom the potential impacts of Federal actions. Federal listing would providethe species additional protection under the Endangered Species Act by requiringa Federal permit to take the species and by requiring Federal agenciesto consult with the Service when projects they fund, authorize, or carryout may adversely affect the species.E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>The Powell River and Elk River populations are small, and if the speciescontinues to exist in the Green River and Tennessee River, these populationsmust be very limited. All the populations are geographically isolated fromeach other. This isolation restricts the natural interchange of geneticmaterial between the populations, and the small population size reducesthe reservoir of genetic variability within the populations. It is likelythese populations, with the possible exception of the Clinch River, arenow below the generally acceptable level (Soule 1980) required to maintainlong-term genetic viability. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the cracking pearly mussel (<T3>Hemistena </T3>(=<T3>Lastena</T3>) <T3>lata</T3>) as an endangered species. Historical records reveal thatthe species, although now rare, was once widely distributed in the OhioRiver drainage. Presently only three, small, isolated populations, andpossibly two others, are known to survive. These populations are all threatenedby a variety of factors, including gravel dredging, coal mining, oil andgas resource development, and other factors that adversely impact the aquaticenvironment. Due to the species' history of population losses and the vulnerablenature of the populations, threatened status does not appear appropriatefor this species. See the following section for a discussion of why criticalhabitat is not being proposed for the cracking pearly mussel. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a speciesthat is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for the cracking pearly mussel at this time, owingto the lack of benefits from such designation. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the National Park Service are the threeFederal agencies most involved, and they, along with the State naturalresources agencies in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia, are already awareof the location of the remaining populations that would be affected byany activities in these river reaches. These Federal agencies have conductedstudies in these river basins and are knowledgeable of the fauna and oftheir projects' impacts. No additional benefits would accrue from criticalhabitat designation that would not also accrue from the listing of thespecies. In addition, this species is so rare that taking for scientificpurposes or private collections could be a threat. The publication of criticalhabitat maps and other information accompanying critical habitat designation,such as the location of inhabited river reaches, could increase that threat.The location of populations of this species have consequently been describedonly in general terms in this proposed rule. Available precise localitydata will be accessible to appropriate Federal, State, and local governmentalagencies through the Service office described in the ``<T2>Addresses</T2>'' section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibition against takingand harm are discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed criticalhabitat. If a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a speciesor destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay adversely affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsibleFederal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. TheService has notified Federal agencies that may have programs that affectthe species. Federal activities that could occur and impact the speciesinclude, but are not limited to, the carrying out or the issuance of permitsfor hydroelectric facility construction and operation, reservoir construction,river channel maintenance, stream alterations, wastewater facilities development,and road and bridge construction. It has been the experience of the Service,however, that nearly all section 7 consultations have been resolved sothat the species has been protected and the project objectives have beenmet. In fact, the areas inhabited by the cracking pearly mussel are alsoinhabited by other mussels that have been federally listed since 1976.The Service has a history of successful section 7 conflict resolutionsthat have protected the species and provided for project objectives beingmet throughout these areas. The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth aseries of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangeredwildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take any listed species, importor export it, ship it in interstate commerce in the course of commercialactivity, or sell it or offer it for sale in interstate or foreign commerce.It is also illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or shipany such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions wouldapply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for scientificpurposes to enhance the propagation or survival of the species and/or forincidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. In someinstances, permits may be issued during a specified period of time to relieveundue economic hardship that would be suffered if such relief were notavailable. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited </ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought on: (1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to this species; (2) The location of any additional populations of this species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by Section 4 of the Act; (3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thisspecies; and (4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on this species. Final promulgation of the regulation on this species will take into considerationthe comments and any additional information received by the Service, andsuch communications may lead to adoption of a final regulation that differsfrom this proposal. The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the FieldSupervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Asheville Field Office, 100Otis Street, Room 224, Asheville, North Carolina 28801. <ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="74">References Cited </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Ahlstedt, S.A. 1986.
