 During the past decade, evolutionaryupgrades in processor speed and memory have opened up many of those remotespaces; in company with several other technologies, computer graphics hascrossed the threshold into mainstream computing.andM;There have been a number of remarkable characteristics to this journey.andM;Gains and lossesandM;It has been painful.andP;  A number of go-go markets defaulted on their promise  -like corporate animation, business graphics, interactive video, and remotesensing.andP;  And the mainstay market -computer-aided design (CAD)  - has maturedto the point where it's lucky to have double-digit growth rates.andM;Commerce dominantandM;The technological emphasis of the market is fast giving way to commercialapplications  - mostly on the strength of electronic and desktop publishing.andM;Commodity reignsandM;By now over half of the processing power involved in computer graphics sitson the desktop or at deskside  - in PCs and workstations.andP;  Proprietarysystems have faded as applications and systems moved toward commodity status.andO;Software bottlenecksandM;Price thresholds seem no longer to be the barriers to acceptance of computergraphics  - since hardware is getting so cheap.andP;  But tremendous bottlenecksare resulting from the pace of software development, the ability of users toupgrade or adapt to new applications, and the lack of standards in manymarkets.andM;No niche an islandandM;Changes in computer graphics technology are becoming deeply enmeshed withchanges in other computing technology  operating systems, reduced instructionset computing, standard hardware platforms, mass storage, and laser printing,to name a few.andM;There's several pages more of items available, but the general drift isevident with this sample.andP;  The computer graphics industry is no longer aniche market.andM;At $26.3 billion last year, using reasonable definitions of what's computergraphics and what's not, it's a legitimate market all on its own.andP;  Even theniche markets within the computer graphics market -like desktop publishing,mapping, electronic CAD, and image processing  - are getting too big to becalled niches.andM;Graphics embeddedandM;At the same time, computer graphics functions are bleeding into other markets- more end users are touching and feeling graphics in their applications,more applications are embedding graphics in what they do and how they do it.andM;Graphics is no longer a function reserved solely for specialists sitting atproprietary systems.andM;Confirmation of this last point comes in figures compiled by TFS.andP;  Accordingto TFS, over two-thirds of the market revenues five years ago centered onproprietary and specialized systems for medical imaging, high-end electronicpublishing, CAD and the like.andM;The Apple Macintosh spread the gospel of graphics; the laser printer unseateddot matrix and impact printers as the output device of choice; color monitorsachieved at least parity with monochrome.andM;Business graphics charts the curveandM;Indeed, the decade began with the formation of companies for whom graphicsprovided a business edge  - like Apollo Computer and Sun Microsystems, andended with the formation of still more, like Stellar Computer and ArdentComputer.andM;But the events of the decade's last year show signs of changes.andP;  Prime,floundering under takeover attack, sought to sell Computervision, the CADcompany it had bought as a bid to bolster its own minicomputer line and totake advantage of similar focuses in technical computing.andP;  Hewlett-Packardacquired Apollo Computer -- and a month later high flying Sun Microsystemsannounced its first quarterly loss.andP;  It had grown faster than its ownaccounting system.andM;Stellar and Ardent merged, under pressure, as the market for $100,000workstations for scientists proved too small for both.andP;  And EBM beganshipping Presentation Manager, its Macintosh-like user interface, at the sametime that Apple became a $6 billion company.andM;Inside the linked segmentsandM;As the charts hint but don't show to fullness, the computer graphics marketis really a mosaic of market segments and subsegments; their fortunes are atthe same time both connected and separate.andM;For example, the same workstation technology powers the mechanicalengineering market and is shoring up the growth rate of the medical imagingmarket now that the growth of imaging scanners has slowed.andP;  The same versionof mass storage technology advances color events in both image processing andelectronic CAD -- as do other technologies, events, vendor actions, and evenaccidents.andM;But on the whole the various segments and subsegments of the market leadseparate lives.andP;  This is one of the reasons large vendors and investors insmaller companies worry so much about defining their own markets.andP;  Actionsappropriate in one market may be inappropriate in others.andM;Six central markets still define the field of computer graphics.andP;  At thispoint, it's worth looking briefly at each one of them.andM;DESIGN ENGINEERING.andP;  CAD/CAM/MCAE, Industrial Design.andP;  The key trends herecontinue to be the migration to standard platforms, the penetration(cannibalization) of the market by PC and workstation solutions, and the slowpermeation of the boundaries between design, engineering, and manufacturingengineering.andM;The general game seems to be the increasing support of PCs and workstationson networks, and increased linkages between databases.andP;  While it's not clearyet how much of the market has shifted from first-time sales to grades andadd-ons, it is clear that the market is more the latter than the former.andM;Unit shipments are still robust  - and there's plenty of room left in dieMCAD/MCAE area  - but falling unit costs are driving revenue growth ratesunder 10%.andP;  Spot markets exist in areas like industrial design and packaging,and in some foreign markets, but in general the design engineering market isbeginning to behave like a mature market, on some days, anyway.andM;ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN.andP;  A/E/C CAD, facilities management and planning,engineering analysis.andM;Because of its fragmentation  - so many small firms of so many types offeringarchitectural services  - this market is particularly well suited to PC andstandalone workstation solutions.andP;  Hence it's growing a tad faster than itslarger CAD cousin mentioned above.andM;There is still plenty of automation to go.andP;  The problems now relate tocompatibility  - between the architectural CAD, often based on Macs, and theengineering CAD, often on PCs on larger systems, that provides theengineering analysis behind the architects drawings.andM;Architects still search for a system that lets them do their creative work onthe system  - even as they've gotten used to using their systems to take careof the details of drafting, generating furniture layouts and schedules, andoutputting renderings suitable for wooing clients.andM;VISUAL COMMUNICATIONS.andP;  Presentation, multimedia, training, entertainment,and video production.andM;A smaller market segment that numbers a few subsegments that seem to haveever-receding potentials, this area of computer graphics continues to be moreinteresting than most.andM;Animation has yet to take off in either the corporate presentation ortraining world, but one could see its advantages.andP;  If one didn't have to bean animator to pull it off.andP;  As for business presentations, much of thecategory has been filched by desktop publishing and the resurgence of theoverhead transparency as a presentation medium.andP;  Yet multimedia is coming.andO;In new product announcements last year both IBM and Apple paid special homageto the technology  - IBM offering it with its new Intel 80486-based PCs,Apple with a marketing focus on the subject.andP;  What's more, a number oftechnologies are coming together that will set the stage for multimediagrowth  - including object-oriented database and programming (facilitatingimage manipulation), optical disk, local networking, and scanning.andP;  What'snot clear is how fast the technologies will coalesce into applications thatdrive equipment purchases.andM;GRAPHICS ARTS.andP;  Electronic publishing, pre-press, illustration design, andfine arts.andM;A market segment already stormed and captured for the most part by thepersonal computer, particularly the Macintosh, the graphics arts business isgoing through much of what happened to the music production business oncedigital recording hit.andP;  The profession is undergoing rapid change.andM;First and foremost may be that more artwork is getting done  particularly inelectronic publishing and pre-press  - with fewer artists.andP;  And those whoserepertoire of skills does not include familiarity with the tools ofautomation now available to the profession are dinosaurs indeed.andM;The big trends on the horizon include: (1) increasing adoption of color andautomation of color proofing and processing, (2) increasing integration ofprocesses (direct design to print), and (3) migration to digital video(electronic darkroom, video input to multimedia.) The big unknown is thedegree of saturation of the electronic publishing, specifically the desktoppublishing market.andP;  Note that we have lowered expectations for the market in1993 from what they were in last year's industry review  - reflecting abelief that sometime in the next three years the market will begin to grow atthe pace of application innovation.andM;MAPPING.andP;  GIS, geophysics, cartography, business mapping.andM;What with scaling the mountain of conversion of old maps to digital formatand awaiting, perhaps too passively, for new applications to spur demand, themapping business is still betwixt and between.andP;  Here's a fragmented potentialmarket  - lots of land use planners, local zoning commissions, real estatedevelopers, and direct marketing outfits  - that could use the technology.andO;Unfortunately they need the kind of technology now embedded in six and sevenfigure systems and gigabyte databases.andP;  So the main market thrust continuesto come from utility companies, the commercial map makers themselves, thefederal government, and oil companies.andP;  These, unfortunately, are not boomingbusinesses in and of themselves.andP;  Most likely the big breakthroughs thismarket needs will come later in this decade rather than sooner.andM;SCIENCE AND MEDICINE.andP;  Visualization, imaging, and analysis.andM;The overriding trend here is taking place in the medical imaging area  -where health care costs have put a damper on sales of million-dollarscanners.andP;  There is a flip side, though, and it's the rapid growth of the aftermarket,&quot; namely networked workstations for analysis and optical systemsfor storing images and medical records.andP;  In other areas of science, graphicscontinues to play a quiet but revolutionizing role  - in molecular modeling,in astrophysics, in software development, and in all manner of simulation andanalysis.andP;  Would that scientists  - many working on grants from thegovernment or under the auspices of academia  - had more money.andM;The next decadeandM;For all the internecine warfare underway in the computer graphics market  -little systems chewing away at timeshared larger ones, proprietary systemsunder assault from general purpose or standard systems  - the computergraphics market will do well in the 1990s overall.andP;  By 1993, in fact, it willbe within spitting distance of $50 billion.andM;What's more, there's no reason to believe that the overall market will hitsaturation levels.andP;  A number of reasons for this:andM;The infrastructure for computer graphics is still rudimentary.andP;  But it'simproving.andP;  These include improvements in the ability to store and manipulateimages, in large bandwidth networking, in user interfaces, and in graphicsstandards.andP;  Once some of these elements are in place, like object management,windowing programs, and embedded image processing, graphics applications willbe easier to develop.andM;Overseas markets are still underdeveloped.andP;  While much of the informationprocessing industry gets 50% of revenues from non-U.S.andP;  markets, the computergraphics community gets less than that.andM;Visualization will become real in the 1990s.andP;  The idea of &quot;steering&quot;applications, particularly simulation, using interactive graphics is still inits infancy.andP;  But it won't be 10 years from now.andP;  By then we'll be doingthings with visualization we can't conceive of today.andM;HDTV will be here.andP;  The advent of high-definition TV and the integration ofTV and computing technology, not to mention the widespread deployment offiberoptic networks, will play a wild card role in the computer graphicsmarket.andP;  Forecasting how HDTV and computer graphics enrich or impact oneanother is highly speculative  - other than to say they will.andM;Computer-literate now, we should grow increasingly graphics-literate in theyears to come, thanks as much probably to Steven Spielberg and Steven Jobs asto any others.andP;  This in turn will generate a demand for graphics that willfeed upon itself.andM;Graphics comes  into its ownandM;Eventually, in fact, after 50 years of dealing with graphics-poor.andP;  computertechnology  - in a way that goes counter to our own visual senses  - we willonly deal with our computers through graphics, and much of the way weautomate our daily tasks will be based on graphical approaches.andP;  Since we'reso far from that today, one can't help but feel the decade ahead ought to beat least as momentous for the computer graphics industry as the decade past.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
