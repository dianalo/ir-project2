Preincubation of DNA pol I with PG resulted in the loss ofpolymerase, 3'-5'-exonuclease, and DNA binding functions. Furthermore,the presence of DNA but not deoxynucleoside triphosphates protected theenzyme from inactivation. Labeling studies with [7-{sup 14}C]PG indicatedthat two arginine residues were modified per mole of enzyme. In orderto locate the site of PG modification, we digested the PG-treated enzymewith trypsin and V-8 protease. The resulting peptides from each digestwere then resolved on reverse-phase hydrophobic columns. As appearanceof a new peptide peak was observed in both tryptic and V-8 protease digests.Since inclusion of template-primer during PG modification of enzyme blocksthe appearance of these peaks, these peptides were concluded to representthe template-primer binding domain of pol I. Indeed, the extent of inactivationof enzyme by PG treatment correlated very well with the quantitativeincrease in the new tryptic peptide peak. Amino acid composition analysisof both tryptic peptide and V-8 peptide revealed that two peptides werederived from the same general region; tryptic peptide spanned betweenresidues 837 and 857 while V-8 peptide spanned between residues 841 and870 in the primary sequence of pol I. Sequence analysis of tryptic peptidefurther identified arginine-841 as the site of PG modifications, whichimplicates this residue in the DNA binding function of pol I.</TEXT></DOC>
