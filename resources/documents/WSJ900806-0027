Judge Harold Greene said, &quot;U S West has been engaged in asystematic and calculated effort to frustrate thedepartment's legitimate demands for information, frequentlyby patently frivolous and usually dilatory maneuvers.&quot; Hecontinued: &quot;Indeed, in many respects, U S West's legal basisfor withholding documents or objecting to testimony wasentirely without legal foundation, factual basis, or both.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Judge Greene, who oversees the consent decree that brokeup the Bell System in 1984, made the remarks in an order lastweek setting up procedures for U S West to turn over certaindocuments to Justice Department investigators.   In January, the Justice Department whittled down itsrequest to 108 documents, and U S West decided that 23 couldbe handed over, at least in part.   A U S West spokesman said the Denver-based company hasturned over &quot;at least 60,000 documents to the JusticeDepartment. The order covers 108, an infinitesimal number ofdocuments.&quot; U S West, he said, believes that most of thosedocuments are confidential.   Judge Greene's decision in the documents dispute could beappealed, but the company hasn't decided whether to take thatstep, the spokesman said. He declined to discuss the overallinvestigation or alleged improprieties in obtaininggovernment contracts for switching services.   The scope of the investigation hasn't been disclosed, butfor the past three years, the agency, which has enforcementauthority for the Bell consent decree, has been looking intoalleged irregularities in switching service contracts betweenU S West and the General Services Administration.   At least part of the investigation involves switchingcontracts awarded in 1987, a job that was a precursor toconstruction of FTS-2000, the multibillion-dollar contract toupgrade the federal government's long-distancetelecommunications system. That contract was split betweenAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and U S SprintCommunications Co., a unit of United Telecommunications Inc.Last year, a GSA engineer pleaded guilty to accepting mealsfrom BellSouth Corp. during the bidding process for theswitching contracts. BellSouth wasn't charged.   In the U S West matter, Judge Greene said that two yearsago, the company &quot;withheld hundreds of documents,&quot; claimingthey were confidential. For the past two years, he said, &quot;U SWest has engaged in a calculated effort to delay compliancewith the department's request by a variety of tactics, in themain related to claims of privilege.&quot; Later, when somedocuments were delivered to the department, he said, &quot;itbecame apparent that there never had been a basis for theclaims of privilege.&quot;   The judge also criticized U S West's assertion ofconfidentiality when Justice Department lawyers begandeposing U S West employees. The company, he said,&quot;instructed witnesses not to answer even though theinformation had already been disclosed in substantial part inother documents or testimony.&quot;   The court order said U S West already has disclosedattorney-client communications on four topics, and thus haswaived its claim of privilege on those subjects. The topicsinclude a U S West decision that it didn't discriminate bycharging ATandamp;T and the GSA different rates for certainservices, and the application of special access surcharges toprivate lines used in connection with switching services.   For remaining documents, the judge ordered both sides towork out an agreement, and he told U S West that &quot;in view ofits past indefensible dilatory conduct,&quot; the company has theburden of explaining in detail why disputed documents shouldremain secret.   The document squabble follows a Nynex Corp. indictment May31 on one count of criminal contempt for violating the Bellconsent decree by providing information services through itstiny Telco Research Corp. unit. The Justice Departmentcharged that Telco, a software company, provided MCICommunications Corp. with computer services used to find thecheapest way to configure telecommunications networks for bigcorporate customers.   Both matters are being handled by the department's specialtask force to examine allegations of illegal activity by theseven Baby Bells. At the time of the Nynex indictment,Constance Robinson, who heads the task force, said the unitwas investigating other regional phone companies.</TEXT></DOC>
