Members of Teamsters Local 399 yesterday voted overwhelmingly to reject a contract offer from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and to strike Monday. Herb Steinberg, Alliance spokesman, said a strike is likely, despite a federal mediation session set for today.    &quot;We're prepared,&quot; he said. &quot;We'll continue to produce if they go on strike.&quot;    The Alliance is seeking various givebacks. It wants to abolish extra pay for weekends that fall within an employee's five-day workturn, and also wants lower wages for some drivers.    Another 800 craft employees also were voting yesterday on whether to strike; results weren't immediately available.    Hollywood was practically paralyzed during a 22-week strike by movie and television writers that ended Aug. 7 when the writers finally granted the producers' main demand -- a sliding payment schedule for certain television royalties. The 9,000-member Writers Guild of America generally is seen as having lost that dispute. </TEXT></DOC>
