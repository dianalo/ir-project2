A series of alternativesfor better energy usage are presented and assessed by first and secondlaw methods. The efficiency of the overall system based upon conventionalmethods is of the order of 81%. In contrast, the second law efficiencyof the system is about 4.5%. This low value is a consequence of the irreversibilitiesinherent to the heat transfer processes. An analysis were performed torecommend supply and return operating temperatures, aimed at reducingfuel and electricity energy inputs, and yet fulfill heat exchanging constraints.</TEXT></DOC>
