For the quarter, ended March 31, net income was about $1.8 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $107,745. For the year-ago period, profit from continuing operations was $749,482, or 14 cents a share; a loss from discontinued operations totaled $857,227.    Preston B. Heller Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview that sales jumped 28% to $73.4 million for the latest period from $57.4 million the year before.    Mr. Heller said the company is benefiting from broad-based demand for electronic parts, including renewed strength in the original-equipment sector. Pioneer-Standard also is increasing its market share, officials said.    For all of fiscal 1988, Pioneer-Standard expects to report profit of about $5.2 million, or 96 cents a share, up sharply from year-earlier net income of $462,003, or nine cents a share, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $1.4 million. For fiscal 1987, profit from continuing operations was $1.8 million, or 34 cents a share.    Mr. Heller said fiscal 1988 sales rose about 20% to $254.6 million from $212.2 million.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Pioneer-Standard's stock closed at $8.375, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
