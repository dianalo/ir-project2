When USDA's proposed operating budget was sent to Congress lastFebruary, net price support outlays by the department's CommodityCredit Corp. were estimated at $17.7 billion for the current yearand $17.1 billion for the fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1.   The revised estimates, based upon a ``mid-session review'' ofUSDA budget figures, are tentative and still subject to revision.However, as of now, they call for commodity price support spendingto drop this year to around $13.1 billion and in fiscal 1989 to$11.1 billion.   Spending on farm supports soared to a record $25.8 billion in1986, the first year of a new farm law passed in 1985. The lawauthorized gradual reductions in ``deficiency payments'' made tofarmers when market prices are depressed. It also allowed otheradjustments, including the lowering of basic price support loanrates for major commodities.   Outlays for support edged down to $22.4 billion in 1987 but wereexpected to decline more in future years as lower adjustments weremade in the law's various formulas, including reduced dairysupports.   But rising exports, followed by drought this year, boostedcommodity prices sharply. That has lessened the need for largedeficiency payments for some crops.   Not all commodities have shared in the expected cost reduction.Some programs, including cotton and rice, will be more costly tooperate in the coming year.   But the anticipated savings in direct payments to farmers was animportant arguing point in favor of the recent $3.9 billion droughtrelief measure signed Aug. 11 by President Reagan. Corn, soybeansand spring wheat areas have been the hardest hit.   According to a summary provided at the request of The AssociatedPress, most of the $10.6 billion in savings this year and next willcome as a result of reduced payments to producers of feed grains,which include corn, sorghum, oats and barley.   Feed grains payments in fiscal 1987 totaled nearly $14 billion.This year's payments are expected to decline to $8.2 billion and in1989 those will drop to less than $2.73 billion, according to theestimates.   Last February, USDA budget analysts said feed grains paymentsmight be about $12.6 billion this year and $11.1 billion in 1989.   Some other payments and comparisons, included:   _Wheat, $2.84 billion in 1987, $556.9 million in 1988 and $695.5million in 1989. Earlier, this year's payments were forecast at$1.08 billion and 1989's at $1.52 billion.   _Rice, $905.9 million in 1987, $124.6 million in 1988 and $1billion in 1989. The earlier forecast was $189 million in 1988 and$320 million in 1989.   _Upland cotton, $1.79 billion in 1987, $756.8 million in 1988and $2.61 billion in 1989. The earlier forecast was $42 million in1988 and $229 million in 1989.   _Dairy, $1.17 billion in 1987, $1.18 billion in 1988 and $681.9million in 1989. The earlier forecast was $1.23 billion in 1988 and$936 million in 1989.   _Wool, $152.1 million in 1987, $136.7 million in 1988 and $84.7million in 1989. The earlier forecast was $125 million in 1988 and$127 million in 1989.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Agriculture Department scientists say theyhave not forsaken the Asian cockroach. They're still looking forways to kill it.   The pest invaded Florida two years ago and has been a target ofUSDA eradicators since then, the department said Wednesday. And theanti-roach campaign will continue at least through the next fiscalyear.   Ralph A. Bram, head of research on insects affecting humans andanimals for the department's Agricultural Research Service, saidthat contrary to reports, the agency has ``not closed out anyresearch program aimed at controlling these pests.''   Bram said the agency's research budget next year is for $243,700to be spent on cockroaches, the same as this year. The work is doneat the agency's laboratory in Gainesville, Fla., in cooperationwith the University of Florida.   The agency said recent published reports implied that anotherUSDA scientist, Richard J. Brenner, said the cockroach will spreadto all of the contiguous 48 states.   Bram said there is no way of knowing exactly how far north thecockroach will migrate. Because of winter temperatures, he said, itis doubtful the insect would survive father north than Maryland onthe East Coast, Tennessee in the central area, and lower Washingtonstate in the West.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department has announcedallocations totaling $110 million for 46 projects under theTargeted Export Assistance program for the fiscal year that willbegin Oct. 1.   Under the program, various trade organizations get money tocarry out overseas promotion of designated agricultural products.The program is aimed at countering or offsetting adverse effects ofunfair foreign trade practices on U.S. exports.   In most cases, the sponsoring organizations put up some of theirown money in carrying out a specific project, although the amountof those contributions vary and are subject to negotiation with thedepartment.   The $110 million for 1989 is the same as for this year, a levelset by Congress in the 1985 farm law.   Officials said Wednesday the biggest amount, $8.9 million, willgo to the U.S. Meat Export Federation to promote red meat, varietymeats and related products. Other leading recipients includeAmerican Soybean Association, $8.8 million; Cotton CouncilInternational, $7.9 million; and the California Raisin AdvisoryBoard, $7.7 million.</TEXT></DOC>
