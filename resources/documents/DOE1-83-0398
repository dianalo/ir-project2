The investigationprogramme consists of the following three parts: A thermal fatigue experimentand fractographic studies, experiments to characterize the material,and the fracture mechanics analysis. In the thermal fatigue experimentsmall cylindrical plates are used which are exposed to a heating phaseand a second phase in which the specimens are cooled down under welldefined boundary conditions. The use of small specimens offers the advantagethat the test conditions can be varied, e.g., the initial crack geometry,the thermal load and the material investigated. By use of semi-ellipticalsurface cracks the behaviour of cracks in components can be adequatelydescribed. The crack growth analysis relies on linear-elastic fracturemechanics to predict crack growth per cycle. The thermal stress distributionis calculated using Finite Element programs. Stress-intensity factorsare calculated with the weight function method. The crack growth parametersC and n which enter the Paris relation and strongly depend not only onthe material but on the environmental conditions such as the surroundingmedium, load shape and frequency, are determined in mechanical fatigueexperiments with standard CT-specimens and plates having a semi-ellipticalinitial crack geometry. Besides fractographic studies the post-test analysesare performed to compare the theoretical prediction with the experiment.The results of two representative thermal fatigue specimens and post-testanalyses are demonstrated.
