Each Thursday afternoon, 13 teen-age girls pick up $7 and snackon chips and soda at the La Mariposa Health Care Center, a DenverGeneral Hospital clinic in the low-income, largely Hispanicneighborhood where most of them grew up.   Twelve of them already have at least one child, and many bringtheir babies along. This is a program for girls who have gottenpregnant by age 16 and know the consequences of teen pregnancyfirsthand.   ``It's an incentive program and it's a support group,'' saysMargo Daly, assistant director of Planned Parenthood of the RockyMountains, which sponsors the program.   ``In the past two years, out of more than 20 girls, we've hadonly two pregnancies. That's really successful for the kind ofgroup we're dealing with.''   The program has sparked interest around the country, and spawneda similar program in San Mateo, Calif., Daly says.   The girls use the weekly sessions to talk about child-rearing,school, dating _ providing each other the support that they mightotherwise try to find having another baby, organizers say.   Consciously or unconsciously, they are addicted to motherhood,says Dr. Jeffrey Dolgan, a child psychologist at Children'sHospital who thought up the ``Dollar-A-Day'' program several yearsago after directing a home for troubled youths and seeing a steadystream of teen mothers come through.   ``Their deprivation and emptiness _ their longing for somethinguniquely their own'' compels girls in their situation to getpregnant, Dolgan says. ``That, plus weak refusal skills and apassive understanding of their role as women.''   Dolgan says weekly support from others like them helps the girlsovercome a psychological longing for a child. The money andrefreshments are added incentive, a psychological ploy he says istoo often overlooked in addressing the nationwide teen pregnancyproblem.   The girls don't like seeing themselves as deprived, but someagree they wanted to get pregnant.   ``My cousin had a baby and I felt I kind of lost her. I felt Ineeded someone with me all the time,'' said Jo Ann Armijo, 17,holding her 5-month-old son, Jose, on her lap at one Thursdayafternoon session.   Now, she attends high school through the city's Teen ParentEducation Network, which provides some day-care. She doesn't wantto get pregnant again, because she wants to become a veterinarianand to be able to provide for Jose, she said.   Armijo said the money isn't the reason she and other girls cometo the clinic each week, although ``it gives them something tothink about.''   For her, the session ``gives me a chance to let some of myfeelings out _ or if I need to know something about the babies'' _things like teething and heat rash, or what to do when you want togo to school and can't find a babysitter.   Planned Parenthood estimates the program costs about $600 pergirl annually, paid for by donations. Daly says that makes it acheap alternative to teen pregnancy.   Last year, Gov. Roy Romer's Initiative on Teen Pregnancyreported: ``The cost to Colorado totals over $200 million each yearin Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, Medicaidand other public assistance for families headed by women who begantheir childbearing as teens.''   The state health department reported that one in 10 babies bornin Colorado in 1987 was born to a teen-ager, and teen-agepregnancies resulted in more than 5,700 births and 3,000 abortions.   Maria Olivia Valdez, 17, has come to the sessions since her son,Chris, was born a year and a half ago. For her, it's a welcomebreak in a week filled with high school, a job at a grocery storeand the responsibilities of motherhood.   ``I didn't want to get pregnant, but I was happy because I likekids, especially newborns,'' she said.   She enjoys being with the other girls. ``They're your same ageand they have babies, too, so they know how you're feeling.   ``A lot of girls think, `I might as well have another baby sinceI can't go out and work much (with one child already).' Here, yourealize it'll be harder to take on another baby _ it'll stop yourcareer life ... You just won't feel right living off of yourparents or your in-laws.''   The girls, as young as 13, can stay in the Dollar-A-Day programfor two years or until they are 18. Most take high-school classes,and some have jobs, counselor Diane Medina says.   Seven dollars a week doesn't go far, but can pay for diapers ora snack on the way home, several girls said.   Valdez, unusual in the group in that she lives with her son'sfather, another teen-ager, said she used to spend the $7 a week onlaundry and diapers, but now saves it for her son.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday AMs, Nov. 20</NOTE></DOC>
