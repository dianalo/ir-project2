(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Although he was acquitted, the trial ofan Army sergeant charged with killing a civilian during the U.S.invasion of Panama has left some soldiers with doubts about usingdeadly power.   ``It would make me hesitate,'' Sgt. Gina Nixon said Friday afterthe military jury announced the verdict. ``Just look at the all thethings he's gone through to prove his innocence.''   Master Sgt. Roberto Enrique Bryan, 43, a paratrooper with 19years in the Army, was found innocent of unpremeditated murder, orvoluntary manslaughter, in the death of a wounded, unarmedPanamanian.   Ted Sampley, publisher of U.S. Veteran News and Report, said thecourt-martial has caused ``irreparable damage to the morale ofcombat soldiers. Combat soldiers must not hesitate in the face ofthe enemy.'' The publication set up a defense fund for Bryan.   ``The message is one of confusion,'' Sampley said. ``What is acombat soldier's exact role now? Should he be a police officer andworry about human rights. Or is he a soldier conditioned to inflictdeadly casualties on the enemy?''   In the Dec. 23, 1989, episode, Bryan's unit stopped a carload offive Panamanians at a roadblock. A grenade was tossed and thesoldiers opened fire, killing four of the men; 10 American soldierswere injured by the grenade.   The fifth Panamanian man was injured. Bryan shot and killed hima short time later under circumstances that were at issue in thetrial.   The prosecution's case rested on the testimony of 1st Lt.Brandon Thomas, who said Bryan shot the man without provocation toavenge the soldiers injured in the grenade explosion. A prosecutor,Capt. Charlie Luckey, called it ``a battlefield summary execution.''   Witnesses supported Bryan's contention that the man madethreatening moves and testified that Thomas did not see theshooting.   Luckey said the defense witnesses who testified they saw thePanamanian make a threatening motion ``all missed something.''   ``We're all soldiers and we all know we kill the enemy (but)we're all soldiers and we all know when the enemy is shot up andwounded and no longer a threat, we all know he's no longer acombatant,'' Lucky told jurors.   Bryan's unit, along with most of the 82nd Airborne Division fromthe base, has been deployed to Saudi Arabia. The soldiers still onpost Friday said they would have reacted as Bryan did.   ``Probably under the same circumstances, I would have done thesame thing,'' said Master Sgt. Don Gouldsmith.   Bryan proved by his actions that he was ``willing to put hissoldiers' welfare first, regardless of what the outcome was. Youdon't find that everyday. It's indicative of a good leader,''Gouldsmith said.   Sgt. David McLean said he could only hope that the court-martialdidn't cause soldiers in a combat situation to hesitate.   `Stop and think (about shooting), and you might not be around,''he said.   At least three other U.S. soldiers have been prosecuted fortheir actions during the Panama invasion. One was convicted ofunpremeditated murder and two others were found guilty of lessercharges.</TEXT></DOC>
