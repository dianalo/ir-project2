The Securities and Exchange Commission, which polices thenation's stock and bond markets, has obtained increased cooperationfrom overseas governments in conducting investigations offoreign-based fraud over the past few years.   But many governments remain reluctant to comply with SECrequests for help, and a few express hostility and resentment,providing a convenient shield for foreign insider traders in U.S.securities.   In some countries, the use of non-public information to profitin the financial markets is perfectly acceptable.   ``The world is not in any kind of agreement that insider tradingis a heinous crime,'' said John S. Stoppelman, a securities lawattorney in Washington and former chairman of the SEC task force oninvestigation rules. ``Some of these countries think we're crazy toenforce these laws.''   Obtaining cooperation from foreign governments is an importantpart of the SEC's case against Hong Kong-based businessman Fred C.Lee and Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. junior analyst Stephen Wang Jr.,accused co-conspirators in a scheme to profit on inside informationabout impending corporate takeovers.   A complaint, filed last Monday in U.S. District Court, demandedthe pair return $19 million in alleged illicit profits plus triplepenalties for a total of $76 million. That amount is second only tothe record $100 million in profits and penalties the SEC seizedfrom insider trader Ivan F. Boesky in November 1986.   Although SEC investigators gathered much of the evidence againstWang and Lee in the United States, the key break came when theyquestioned Lee in Hong Kong, for which they needed cooperation fromthe British colony's government.   ``The fact they were taking testimony in Hong Kong suggests thecommission is much further along than a couple of years ago ingetting active and passive assistance of other law enforcementauthorities,'' said Anne Flannery, a New York-based securitieslawyer who used to work for the SEC.   ``Agencies like the SEC, which are quasi-criminal in nature,don't conduct inquiries without foreign help,'' she said.   Besides the Hong Kong connection, the SEC also has disclosed aSwiss link in the Wang-Lee probe. Commission Chairman David S.Ruder, testifying at a Senate Banking Committee hearing this pastweek, said the commission was negotiating with Switzerland'sgovernment for information about Swiss bank accounts controlled byLee and a possible freeze of assets in those accounts.   In addition, SEC enforcement chief Gary Lynch disclosed at thesame hearing that the commission is pursuing about 50investigations involving foreign trading, with sums ranging from$40,000 to ``some very large amounts.''   SEC officials attribute the growth of these investigationslargely to the increasing relationships between markets, which nowmake it possible to easily trade U.S. stocks in cities ranging fromParis to Singapore. A foreign-based investor with insideinformation about an American company can make profitable tradeshalfway around the world.   As a result, Lynch said in a telephone interview, ``There's moreof an acceptance of the notion that a person who affectstransactions in the securities market of a particular countryshould comply with the laws of that country regardless of wherethey happen to live.''   For example, the Swiss have become increasingly cooperative,securities experts say. Switzerland, which once routinely dismissedqueries about ownership of financial assets, now has an independentcommission that oversees SEC requests for help.   Moreover, a new law took effect Friday in Switzerland that makesinsider trading a criminal offense. The measure will make it easierfor the Swiss to assist the SEC.   Other countries historically have rejected the SEC's requestsfor information and continue to do so, partly out of sovereigntyprinciples. France and Liechtenstein, for example, are considerednotoriously uncooperative.   Sen. Donald W. Reigle Jr., D-Mich., has sponsored a bill aimedat making it easier for the SEC to investigate foreign-basedinsider trading. The bill would allow the commission to investigateon behalf of foreign governments, which would be expected toreciprocate.   Nevertheless, such legislation would not compel other countriesto adopt U.S.-style prohibitions against insider trading, whichremains a fundamental problem as international securities marketsgrow in complexity and scope.   ``I don't think they're going to buy all our concepts ofsecurities fraud,'' Stoppelman said. ``Just because it seemsmorally unacceptable, that doesn't mean the whole world agrees withus.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
