How much more practical and charming, for me and forthem, it would be if these giraffes made themselves availablepublicly in miniature versions, like Reader's Digestcondensed books. But they persist in seeing their freakishand obstructive size as a natural right to be flauntedwithout apology. To its credit, however, the OxfordUniversity Press has taken the biggest jewel in its crown andreproduced it in handy miniature form and at (relatively) lowprice.   &quot;The Compact Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (Prepared by J.A.Simpson and E.S.C. Weiner, 2,416 pages, $295) is a small-typeedition of the full text of the full-size OED. That behemoth,in the second edition published in 1989, now runs to 20 bigvolumes, costs $2500 and weighs 138 pounds. By contrast, thecoltish COED contains the same 500,000-plus definitions,127,000 pronunciations, 249,300 etymologies and 2.4 millionillustrative quotations garnered from the entire history ofour language -- all in one liftable 14-pound tome.</LP><TEXT>   How can this be? Basically they do it with lenses. TheCOED, like its micrographic predecessor in two volumes, hastiny type. But this new edition achieves the compact ideal bycompressing nine pages of the full OED onto a single14-by-10-inch COED page.   With the help of the Cyclopean domed magnifier that comeswith the book, it is fairly easy to read, if not browsethrough. Its oceans of verbiage stretch from `a' (over sixpages) to `zyxt' (an obsolete Kentish form of the verb see).   If you want a comprehensive historical dictionary, the OEDis obviously it. And this compact format is the only one forpeople without wads of cash and four feet of shelf space todevote to logomania. In other words, this is the OED for the'90s.   It should keep us happy until we move up to the CD-RomOED, which permits computer-like searches through the entiremazy work, but the price ($950) and the lack of CD-Romhardware will keep most of us waiting a while for thisrefinement. In the meantime, buyers of the COED will be ableto improve their dictionary skills by reading the full-sizetext of the complimentary (and complementary) pamphlet byDonna Lee Berg, &quot;A User's Guide to the Oxford EnglishDictionary.&quot;   This 71-page primer is clearly intended to make thedictionary itself user-friendly (a term amply defined, by theway, in the OED itself). Ms. Berg brings off what might havebeen a mundane task with verve. Her choice of example entriesto show how the OED musters quotations is clever if notsubtly provocative: academia, after, palumbine, periderm,phlizz and wranlons.   Everything on this jewel of a page has an ironic resonanceto it. Ms. Berg has chosen academia, I think, to surprise uswith how recently it popped into the language. The firstquotation is from William H. Whyte's &quot;The Organization Man&quot;of 1956. The second instance, fruitily non-academic indiction, is from the &quot;White House Diary&quot; of an author the OEDidentifies with Wimbledonesque formality as Mrs. L.B.Johnson: &quot;If I had to capsule these two days in Academia, howwould I?&quot;   The citations for &quot;after&quot; show this common word's uncommonpossibilities, e.g. Shakespeare, Julius Caesar: &quot;If you know,That I do fawne on men. . .And after scandall them.&quot; Theother four words are unusual and show the dictionary's range:palumbine, superficially recondite, is actually a poetic andmellifluous way of conjuring the wood pigeon or ring-dove;periderm, on its face a Greek botanicism for &quot;the corkylayers of plant-stems,&quot; turns out to have originated recentlyamong learned Germans; phlizz was Lewis Carroll's &quot;fanciful&quot;term for a fruit or flower without real substance, &quot;hence,allusively, anything without meaning or value, a mere name.&quot;Yet phlizz, as Ms. Berg must want us to conclude, is no mereword, but a splendid piece of whimsy worth knowing about andreviving.   She winds up her elegant demonstration with alexicographical flourish: the extremely obscure 15th-centuryterm wranlons, &quot;unthriving trees that will never becometimber.&quot; In her own voice, Ms. Berg observes, in a quietlydeconstructionist vein, that such a word &quot;may appear morefrequently in dictionaries than in other contexts.&quot;   Not even the OED can contain every word. Owners of thatstill more compact chrestomathy, &quot;Chambers EnglishDictionary,&quot; can be smug about myristicivorous(nutmeg-eating), added to the 1988 Chambers after an earlieredition specifically mentioned this jawbreaker as the kind ofobscurity impossible to include in a single-volume lexicon.It is still not to be found in the OED.   Perhaps it will be soon. Ms. Berg, in the course ofconceding that some entries in the current OED and COED lackmodern quotations, reveals that &quot;updating these entries willbe one of the tasks of the third edition, ALREADY INPROGRESS&quot; (joyful emphasis mine).   ---   Another compact source of useful information comes to usnow from the hand of Barbara Ensrud, who sometimes writesabout wine on this page. &quot;Best Wine Buys for $10 or Less, aGuide for the Frugal Connoisseur Featuring Wines from Aroundthe World&quot; (Villard, 170 pages, $9.95) is just what the titleso fully indicates.   In a few well-chosen words, Ms. Ensrud leads us to theoutstanding values at the low end of the endlesslyproliferating wine market. She is eloquent and timely in herdiscussion of the developing world of serious Chilean wines.She is up to the minute on what to expect from thesurprisingly well-managed vineyards of Bulgaria. Arriving atPortugal, she plumps for several &quot;superbuys,&quot; most especiallythe &quot;dry, delightfully fruity&quot; white muscat from Joao Pires.She even finds superbuys in France and Italy. I won't saywhich, because that would be like revealing whodunit in amurder mystery.</TEXT></DOC>
