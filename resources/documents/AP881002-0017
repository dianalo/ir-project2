Strauss, 73, is head of the Christian Social Union, the Bavariansister party of the nationally dominant Christian Democrats.   He was hospitalized in the Bavarian city of Regensburg aftersuffering a possible stomach rupture in addition to a heart attackthat at first was suspected to be slight, the state governor'soffice said.   State spokesman Helmut Schwaabe said Strauss was strickenSaturday afternoon while on a hunting trip in the Regensburg areaof Bavaria, about 65 miles northeast of Munich.   Schwaabe told The Associated Press in a telephone interview fromhis office in Munich that Strauss was conscious and his conditionhad stabilized by late Saturday evening. Doctors were planning tooperate to correct Strauss' condition, Schwaabe said.   However, the statement issued early Sunday superseded theearlier statements, indicating Strauss had taken a turn for theworse.   The outspoken Strauss often has been at the center of nationalpolicy-making and has used international travels to wield influenceover foreign policy as well.   His thick Bavarian accent coupled with stinging comments alsomakes the outspoken, corpulent state governor West Germany's mostcolorful politician.   From 1966 to 1969, Strauss served as finance minister underthen-Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger in the so-called ``GreatCoalition'' of West Germany's conservative parties with theleft-leaning Social Democrats.   After the Social Democrats took over the government in coalitionwith the centrist, business-oriented Free Democratic Party in 1969,Strauss remained as a member of the federal parliament'sconservative opposition until 1978, when he was elected Governor ofBavaria.   Two years later he was nominated to run for chancellor but lostthe election against Social Democrat Helmut Schmidt in 1980. Hekept his post as Bavarian state governor.</TEXT></DOC>
