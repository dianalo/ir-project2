Medicare program funds cannot generallybe used to pay for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries that arenot covered under the Social Security Act (the Act). This proposed ruledeals primarily with issues related to coverage of services, rather thanto payment for services; that is, with determining the services to be paidfor as benefits under the Medicare program rather than the method or levelof payment. The primary statutory basis for these coverage decisions appearsin section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act, which prohibits payment under theMedicare program for any expenses incurred for services ``which are notreasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injuryor to improve the functioning of a malformed body member.''This proposed rule is being published to establish in regulations generallyapplicable criteria and procedures for determining whether a service is``reasonable'' and ``necessary'' under the Medicare program; to set forththe coverage decisionmaking process that we propose to include in regulations;and to summarize and provide an analysis of the public comments that wereceived in response to the April 29, 1987 notice (52 FR 15560) that announcedour current process for making coverage decisions.That notice was published in accordance with the terms of an agreementsettling a lawsuit, <T3>Jameson</T3> v. <T3>Bowen,</T3> C.A. No. CV-F-83-547-REC (E.D. Cal.). Under the settlement,we agreed to publish for public comment a description of the process weuse to make Medicare coverage decisions. We invited the public to commenton the coverage process currently in use and specifically to comment onprocedures allowing for public input into the coverage decisionmaking processif appropriate. The notice described the current process only, becauseof the limited time available for meeting the court deadline of May 1,1987 for publication of the notice. In publishing that notice, we alsosolicited comments on how the current process could be improved.These regulations are intended to clarify our coverage decisions policyand improve the method for making national coverage decisions. In addition,they are intended to assure that Federal funds are expended only for medicalservices that are appropriate to meet an individual's medical needs. Webelieve that it is important to set forth these policies and proceduresin regulations since decisions on coverage can have a bearing on the availabilityof a medical service. Further, some groups, including the Health IndustryManufacturers Association (HIMA), have urged us to make public the processfor national coverage decisions since they argue that these decisions directlyaffect the diffusion of new technology.In addition, we believe it is important that beneficiaries understand fullythe considerations underlying program coverage decisions. Finally, theAdministrative Conference of the United States, in a December 30, 1986<T4>Federal Register </T4>publication (51 FR 46987), recommended, in part,that more ``openness and regularity'' be introduced into the process forissuing national coverage decisions pertaining to new medical technologiesand procedures.In view of the significant considerations noted above, we propose to establishin regulations generally applicable criteria and procedures for determiningcoverage of specific health care technologies under the Medicare program;and to invite public comment on them. We are soliciting comments on allaspects of the Medicare coverage process including:andbullet; The criteria for coverage decisions, including cost-effectiveness,and their application.andbullet; The identification and selection of health care technologies fornational coverage decisions.andbullet; Methods for assuring appropriate public participation in the variousphases of the technology assessment process.andbullet; The length of time required for review.andbullet; The relationship between determinations by Public Health Service(PHS) agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and theOffice of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA) and Medicare coverage decisions.We have explained in much detail our current process for making coveragedecisions, as well as the changes that we propose to make to this process.To assist readers in referencing sections contained in this proposed rule,we are providing a table of contents below:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1> </H1>I.

Medicare Coverage_General</ITAG>A. Statutory BasisThe Medicare program was established by Congress in 1965 with the enactmentof title XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act). The program providespayment for certain medical services for persons 65 years of age or over,disabled beneficiaries, and persons with end-stage renal disease. The programcurrently covers 28.8 million aged and almost three million disabled individuals.The Medicare program consists of two separate but complementary insuranceprograms, a Hospital Insurance Program, known as Part A, and a SupplementaryMedical Insurance program, known as Part B. Although Part A is called hospitalinsurance, covered benefits also include medical services furnished inskilled nursing facilities (SNFs) or by home health agencies (HHAs) andhospices. For purposes of the Medicare program, we refer to these institutionalentities as ``providers''. These providers must be certified as qualifiedproviders of services and must sign an agreement to participate in theprogram. Part B covers a wide range of medical services and supplies suchas those furnished by physicians or others in connection with physicians'services, outpatient hospital services, outpatient physical therapy andoccupational therapy services, and home health services. Physicians' servicescovered under Part B include visits to patients in the home, office, hospital,and other institutions. Part B also covers certain drugs and biologicalsthat cannot be self-administered, diagnostic x-ray and laboratory tests,purchase or rental of durable medical equipment, ambulance services, prostheticdevices, and certain medical supplies.While the Medicare law provides coverage for the broad categories of benefitsdescribed above, it also places general and categorical limitations onthe coverage of the services furnished by certain health care practitioners,such as dentists, chiropractors, and podiatrists, and it specifically excludessome categories of services from coverage, such as cosmetic surgery, personalcomfort items, custodial care, routine physical checkups, and servicesthat are not reasonable and necessary for diagnosis or treatment of anillness or injury. The statute also provides direction as to the mannerin which payment is made for Medicare services, the rules governing eligibilityfor services, and the health, safety, and quality standards to be met byinstitutions providing services to Medicare beneficiaries.The Medicare law does not, however, provide an all-inclusive list of specificitems, services, treatments, procedures, or technologies covered by Medicare.Thus, except for the examples of durable medical equipment in section 1861(n)of the Act, and some of the medical and other health services listed insections 1861(s) and 1862(a) of the Act, the statute does not specify medicaldevices, surgical procedures, or diagnostic or therapeutic services thatshould be either covered or excluded from coverage.The intention of Congress, at the time the Medicare law was enacted in1965, was that Medicare would provide health insurance to protect the elderlyor disabled from the substantial costs of acute health care services, principallyhospital care. The law was designed generally to cover services ordinarilyfurnished by hospitals, SNFs, and physicians licensed to practice medicine.Congress understood that questions as to coverage of specific serviceswould invariably arise and would require a specific decision of coverageby those administering the program. Thus, it vested in the Secretary theauthority to make those decisions. Section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act states:``Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, no payment may bemade under Part A or Part B for any expenses incurred for items or serviceswhich * * * are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatmentof illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed bodymember.'' This is a key provision since the words ``notwithstanding anyother provision of this title * * *'' make this an overriding exclusionthat may be applicable in a given situation despite the existence of provisionsthat would otherwise permit coverage. Thus, while Congress provided forthe coverage of services such as inpatient hospital care and physicians'services, coverage for those services is prohibited unless they are ``reasonable''and ``necessary''.B. Implementation of the Law Historically, HCFA has interpreted section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act toexclude from Medicare coverage those medical and health care services thatare not demonstrated to be safe and effective by acceptable clinical evidence.However, current regulations are general and we have not defined the terms``reasonable'' and ``necessary'', nor have we described in regulationsa process for how these terms must be applied. (See Medicare regulationsat 42 CFR 405.310(k)(1).) In practice, Medicare contractors (that is, fiscal intermediaries, carriers,health maintenance organizations (HMOs), competitive medical plans (CMPs),and Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organizations (PROs)) arecharged with the responsibility to assure that payments are made only forservices that are covered under Medicare Part A or Part B. (See sectionV below for a further description of contractor functions.) Therefore,they must determine whether a particular service is covered under Medicarein the course of adjudicating a Medicare claim or conducting utilizationand quality review. Our policy on the implementation of section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act isset forth in Part A Intermediary Letter 77-4 and Part B Intermediary Letter77-5 (January 1977). These documents translate the statutory terms ``reasonable''and ``necessary'' into a test as to whether the service in question is``safe'' and ``effective'' and not ``experimental''; that is, whether theservice has been proven safe and effective based on authoritative evidence,or alternatively, whether the service is generally accepted in the medicalcommunity as safe and effective for the condition for which it is used.For Medicare coverage purposes, the term ``experimental'' is used synonymouslywith the term ``investigational''. Further guidelines for contractors administeringthe program are contained in the Intermediary (HCFA Pub. 13-3), Carrier(HCFA Pub. 14-3), and Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization(HCFA Pub. 19) manuals. These manuals are updated periodically throughthe instruction issuance process and comprise the primary source of informationfrom HCFA central office to the contractors on claims adjudication andutilization and quality review. In addition to these general guidelines, we have issued over 200 specificnational Medicare coverage decisions on individual health care technologies.The term ``national coverage determination'' refers to a coverage decisionthat HCFA makes and issues as national policy. The term ``health care technology''refers to any discrete and identifiable regimen or modality used to diagnoseor treat illness, prevent disease, maintain patient well-being, or facilitatethe provision of health care services. These technologies range from practicesthat appear to be obsolete or of questionable effectiveness to new technologies,recently introduced into medical practice, still in an experimental stage,or that are new applications of established technologies. We publish nationalcoverage decisions on health care technologies in the Medicare CoverageIssues Manual (HCFA Pub. 6), and may also publish these decisions in otherHCFA program manuals or as HCFA Rulings in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. National coverage decisions are binding on ourcontractors and must be applied. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Current Process for Making National Coverage Decisions </ITAG>This section expands upon the description of the <T3>current</T3> process we use in making national coverage decisions thatwas published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 29, 1987 (52 FR 15560). A. Referral and Identification of Coverage Issues for National DecisionsThe process for determining whether a health care technology or serviceis covered has been in place for many years. Over time, certain refinementsand revisions have been made in that process, but the basic structure hasremained the same. Decisions on coverage are made mostly by carriers, fiscalintermediaries, and PROs that contract with the Secretary to review andadjudicate claims for Medicare services. (Section V of this preamble describesthe functions of Medicare contractors.) We estimate that almost 400 millionindividual claims were processed by our carriers and intermediaries infiscal year 1987. Most of the individual claims processed by Medicare contractorsdo not raise serious questions about coverage. However, a small numberof services (usually 20 to 30 per year) are the subject of a national coveragedecisionmaking and technology assessment process. Coverage issues of national significance regarding health care technologiesare raised in a variety of ways. Some are raised by individual Medicarebeneficiaries, physicians, equipment manufacturers, public officials, professionalassociations, or government entities. Other coverage issues are raisedduring our ongoing review of current medical literature. However, mostcoverage issues are brought to our attention by our program's contractors. If a contractor cannot resolve a coverage question satisfactorily, or believesa national coverage decision may be necessary, the issue is referred toHCFA central office through a HCFA regional office. In general, the moreexpensive a service is or promises to become, either in an individual caseor in the aggregate, or the more prone it is to raising public health andsafety concerns, the more likely it is to be referred to HCFA central office.Also, the more likely a service is to be subject to overutilization orother abuse, the more likely it is that the contractor will seek our guidanceon a coverage policy. A frequent source of contractor referrals is theCoverage/Payment Technical Advisory Group (TAG). The TAG, which is madeup of medical directors and other officers of the carriers and intermediaries,meets every six to eight weeks with HCFA staff to discuss its experiencewith various coverage and payment issues, and to discuss with us the dispositionof specific coverage questions, including the need for a national coveragedecision when appropriate.  B. Criteria for Selection of Coverage Issues for National Decisions  When a coverage question arises regarding a health care technology, theissue is referred to the Bureau of Eligibility, Reimbursement and Coverage(BERC) within HCFA. BERC may identify a service or technology for our centralizedcoverage process if there are no statutory bars to coverage of the serviceand one or more of the following conditions is present: (1) The servicerepresents a significant advance in medical science; (2) the service canbe described as a new product (that is, a device, drug, or procedure forwhich there is no similar technology already covered under Medicare); (3)the service is likely to be used in more than one region of the country;(4) the service is likely to represent a significant expense to the Medicareprogram; (5) the service has the potential for rapid diffusion and application;(6) there is substantial disagreement among experts regarding the safety,effectiveness, or appropriateness of a service; (7) the service has beentreated inconsistently by contractors and a conflict can be resolved onlyby a national decision; or (8) the service was ``commonly accepted'' bythe medical profession in the past or a national decision to cover theservice was made previously, but appears to have become outmoded or questionsabout its safety and effectiveness have been raised.  After preliminary analysis, BERC may conclude that the coverage issue doesnot meet any of the criteria specified above and that a national coveragedecision is not appropriate or necessary for that specific health caretechnology. If BERC concludes that a national coverage decision is notappropriate or necessary, the individual or organization that requesteda national coverage decision is informed of the basis of the conclusion.In addition, if the request for a national coverage decision was made byone of our contractors, BERC may provide information to contractors asto the opinion of other third party payors, specialty societies, or recognizedmedical authorities regarding the appropriateness of coverage of the healthcare technology in question. However, that information, in the absenceof a national coverage decision is not binding on the contractors who retainthe discretion to cover or not cover, taking into account the circumstancesof the individual case. For example, a contractor may question whethera new surgical procedure to treat a rare medical condition should be covered.BERC may decide that a national coverage decision is not necessary sinceonly a few patients are likely to ever need the procedure. However, aspart of its analysis, it may learn that the procedure is considered experimentalby other third party payors and various specialty societies. The contractorwould be informed that a national coverage decision will not be made andalso informed that the procedure is considered experimental by other entities.The contractor also would be informed that the information is not bindingand that coverage could be provided if the contractor determines that theprocedure is reasonable and necessary in a particular case.  C. HCFA Analysis  <ITAG tagnum="81">1. General  </ITAG>HCFA has used various methods for seeking medical and scientific advicein determining whether a health care technology is reasonable and necessary.The fundamental test has been whether the technology is safe and effectiveor commonly accepted by the medical community. They have included, at onetime or another, the use of PHS advisory councils, ad hoc groups of representativephysicians, and various forms of consultation and liaison with nationalmedical associations. At present, a structured process of review and assessmentinvolves HCFA central office staff physicians, PHS representatives, a contractormedical advisory group, and the medical community.   <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Initial Consideration_Background Papers  </ITAG>If BERC determines that consideration should be given to issuing a nationalcoverage decision for a specific health care technology, BERC conductsa medical literature search, meets with interested parties (proponentsand opponents) as needed, determines the status of any FDA action, andprepares a background summary on the service.  The background paper stresses the information obtained from the medicalliterature search and the administrative aspects of the issue. CurrentMedicare coverage guidelines are discussed, as well as any informationobtained regarding published decisions by other groups involved in technologyassessment.  <ITAG tagnum="81">3. HCFA Physicians Panel  </ITAG>The next step in the process involves presenting the background paper tothe HCFA Physicians Panel for review. This Panel, a group composed of staffphysicians and other health professionals in HCFA's central office andcounterparts from PHS, meets approximately once every six to eight weeks.These sessions are designed to permit the free exchange of ideas amongknowledgeable staff within the Department and are not open to the public.The HCFA Physicians Panel serves in a purely advisory role to BERC. AlthoughBERC utilizes the Panel's expertise in determining whether to develop acoverage question as a national policy, BERC retains responsibility formaking judgments about referring items to PHS for further study and formaking recommendations on coverage for the approval of the HCFA Administrator. Upon weighing background information and medical literature, the Panelmay recommend to BERC that the service should be: (1) Referred to PHS (specificallyto the Office of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA) in the National Centerfor Health Services Research and Health Care Technology Assessment (theNational Center), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health) on eitheran ``inquiry'' basis, or for a full assessment as to safety and effectiveness;or (2) that no national coverage decision be made at that time.  A recommendation to refer an issue to OHTA on an inquiry basis may be madeif the Panel is uncertain that there is sufficient evidence available towarrant a full assessment, or if only limited information is needed inthe context of specific questions. Upon receipt of an inquiry, OHTA typicallygathers background information from other PHS and governmental agenciesand conducts a more indepth review of the medical literature than the BERCstaff is able to do. OHTA contacts FDA for information on the regulatorystatus of the health care technology, if appropriate, and the NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), andother agencies for information on its medical and scientific status.  The information gathered by OHTA is then forwarded to BERC. The responsegenerally includes a brief statement of the steps taken in obtaining theinformation and of the organizations consulted. It responds to all questionsraised by BERC, but does not include a recommendation as to coverage ornoncoverage.  The following parameters are among the major considerations by the Panelin recommending that an issue be referred to OHTA on an assessment basis: andbullet; The issue is of such importance, that a national coverage decisionwill likely be required upon completion of the assessment;  andbullet; The technology involves significant expenditures for Medicare,that is, the technology has the potential for rapid diffusion in a largepatient population or the technology is very expensive on a per case basis; andbullet; The data base appears adequate, that is, there is sufficient scientificevidence to permit conclusions regarding safety and effectiveness (Thedefinition of adequacy will vary according to the nature and course ofthe disease and the difficulty or complexity of the intervention in conductingclinical trials.); and  andbullet; FDA has accepted the technology if it consists of drugs, biologics,or medical devices.  The Panel may recommend that a national coverage decision not be made atthat time. In that case, the individual contractor would continue to makecoverage decisions on a case-by-case basis. In general, this recommendationis made if the issue involves a new or emerging technology or practicefor which it appears there is limited clinical data on which to base afirm coverage decision or when claims have been received from few contractorareas. Coverage decisions in these situtations are best made by the contractor'smedical staff, taking into account the unique circumstances of the individualcase as well as local standards of care.  D. PHS Assessment Process  When HCFA initiates an assessment by referring an issue to OHTA for a coveragerecommendation, OHTA announces the assessment in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, allowing a 90-day period for public comment.OHTA collects information from a wide variety of sources, including medicalliterature, Federal agencies, clinical medical specialty groups, and manufacturersassociations. All relevant information is analyzed and synthesized in orderto develop conclusions regarding the safety and clinical effectivenessof the subject technology. OHTA then prepares an assessment report thatcontains the information on which a coverage recommendation is based. Thatreport forms the basis for a PHS coverage recommendation that is submittedto HCFA in conjunction with the report. After HCFA makes its coverage decision,the OHTA report is made available to the public. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note</T4>._PHS has informed HCFA that a revised set of guidelines forthis process is being prepared, and this material will, after appropriateinternal review, be made available for subsequent public comment.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">1. Drugs and Biologicals </ITAG>Questions regarding coverage of drugs and biologicals are rarely referredto PHS since we have determined as a matter of national policy that drugsor biologicals approved for marketing by FDA are safe and effective whenused for indications specified in their labeling. In addition, FDA-approveddrugs also may be covered when used for indications other than those specifiedon their labeling as long as FDA has not specified such use as non-approved.Coverage of non-labeled uses is determined by our contractors taking intoconsideration the generally accepted medical practice in the community.Treatment Investigational New Drugs (INDs) are approved by FDA but arestill considered experimental and not covered by Medicare. Drugs that havenot received FDA approval for marketing are considered experimental orinvestigational and are not covered except for certain cancer drugs distributedby the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Under its Cancer Therapy Evaluaton, the Division of Cancer Treatment withinNCI, in cooperation with FDA, approves and distributes certain drugs foruse in treating terminally ill cancer patients. One gorup of these drugs,designated as Group C drugs, unlike other drugs distributed by the NCI,are not limited to use in clinical trials for the purpose of testing theirefficacy. In view of NCI controls on their distribution and use, GroupC drugs are covered by Medicare if all other applicable coverage requirementsare satisfied. In accordance with section 202(k)(1)(A) of the Medicare Catastrophic CoverageAct of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-360, enacted July 1, 1988), the Secretary mustconduct a study and report to Congress by January 1, 1990 on the possibilityof covering certain experimental drugs and biologicals (for example, thoseused in the treatment of cancer or in immunosuppressive therapy) as outpatientdrugs under the Medicare program. Consequently, we are interested in receivingcomments on our position concerning Treatment INDs. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Devices </ITAG>FDA approval for the marketing of a medical device will not necessarilylead to a favorable coverage recommendation, particularly if FDA requirementshave been met by means of a notice issued under section 510(k) of the FederalFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 360(k)), rather than bymeans of a premarket approval application (PMA) made under section 515of the FFDCA. This is because a section 510(k) notice generally does notinvolve clinical data showing safety and effectiveness. Only limited safetyand effectiveness data are generally required by FDA for purposes of asection 510(k) notice. FDA findings of safety and effectiveness focus onthe labeled use of a device only, while our decisions may focus on otheruses of a device under average conditions of use (that is, other than ina clinical setting). In accordance with paragraphs (a)(2)(C) and (a)(3)(A) of section 513 ofthe FFDCA (21 U.S.C. 360c) regarding PMAs, FDA determines the safety andeffectiveness of a device by ``weighing any probable benefit to healthfrom the use of the device against any probable risk of illness or injuryfrom such use,'' and effectiveness ``on the basis of well-controlled investigations,including clinical investigations where appropriate, *** from which investigationsit can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that thedevice will have the effect that it purports or is represented to haveunder the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in thelabeling of the device.'' E. Criteria for Making National Coverage Decisions After considering OHTA's recommendation, HCFA decides whether or not theservice should be covered. During the decisionmaking process, a numberof issues must be considered, in interpreting the ``reasonable'' and ``necessary''requirements of the Medicare statute. In making national coverage decisions,HCFA interprets the term ``reasonable'' and ``necessary'' contained insection 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act to mean that a service is safe, effective,non-investigational, and appropriate. Not all of the criteria are necessarilypertinent to every coverage issue and each criterion is not necessarilygiven equal consideration in reaching a final decision. Because of thecomplexity and variety of issues involved in making coverage decisions,we do not think it is possible, or advisable, to try to set quantitativestandards or develop a formula for the application of these criteria. The criteria are identified below by major headings, with a brief descriptionof each criterion and a detailed, although not exhaustive, list of questionsthat we try to answer under each criterion. These questions illustratehow the particular criterion is applied. Because it is often impossibleto identify absolute benchmarks, it is frequently useful in making thesedecisions to compare the service in question with other available diagnosticor therapeutic approaches. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Safety and Effectiveness </ITAG>A service may be determined to be safe and effective if it is generallyaccepted in the medical community as safe and effective. Contrary evidence,however, may support a conclusion that the service is not safe and effectivefor some or all conditions. The standards for safety and effectiveness are less stringent when evaluatingbreakthrough medical or surgical procedures. The more severe and life threateningthe disease process, the more acceptable a relatively less safe technologymay be when no safer or more effective technologies are available. However,such coverage may have certain limitations, for example, setting, patientselection criteria, or provision to later revise a coverage policy basedon subsequent data collection. Medical devices, drugs, and biologicalsthat have been accepted for marketing by FDA are considered safe and effectivefor Medicare coverage purposes when used for the conditions prescribedin the labeling. What is the likelihood that use of the service will cause harm to beneficiaries?Can it be applied safely to a larger proportion of the population thanavailable alternatives? What is the severity of any risks associated withits use? How does the risk associated with this service compare with thatof other services designed to accomplish the same or similar purposes?How does the risk associated with this service compare with the severityof the medical condition it is designed to diagnose or treat? What is thesource and nature of the evidence to support the safety of this service?How confident are we of our conclusions? What is the likelihood that theservice will produce the health benefit it was designed to accomplish?What are the expected outcomes on the morbidity and mortality of beneficiariesto whom it is furnished? What are the indications for its use? Is it equallyeffective for all indications? How do these outcomes compare with thoseof available alternatives? If the purpose of the service is diagnostic,is it significantly more accurate or less invasive than available alternatives?If its purpose is therapeutic, is it significantly more reliable or lesspainful, or does it provide faster healing than available alternatives?How does the effectiveness of this service compare with the severity ofthe illness or injury it is designed to diagnose or cure? What is the sourceand nature of the evidence to support the effectiveness of this service?How confident are we of our conclusions? If we are considering a device,has it been approved for marketing by FDA? If so, what type of review did the device receive (PMA or section 510(k))?Are there any limitations or restrictions on the use of the device? Shouldthe device be used only for certain medical indications? <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Experimental or Investigational </ITAG>A service that is furnished for research purposes in accordance with predeterminedrules is considered experimental or investigational. A drug (except forcertain cancer drugs), biological product, or device that is subject toFDA approval and has not been approved for marketing by FDA is consideredexperimental or investigational. Except for certain breakthrough medicalor surgical procedures, a service that is not used widely because thereis inadequate evidence of safety and effectiveness is considered experimentalor investigational. Has the service been generally accepted by the medical community, and hasit emerged from the research stage? Has the drug or biological been usedindependently or in connection with a medical device approved for marketingby FDA? <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Appropriateness </ITAG>A service is considered appropriate if it is furnished in a setting commensuratewith the patient's medical needs and condition, and furnished by qualifiedpersonnel. Will the service raise questions of a health and safety nature relatingto the appropriate setting? Does use or provision of the service requirespecial qualifications or training? Among the many relevant considerations, safety and effectiveness are thekey factors for our review. Thus, if a health care technology ``failed''either of these two criteria, we would decide not to cover it. On the otherhand, while the fact that it ``passed'' both of these tests would clearlyhave a major influence on our thinking, there are other considerationsthat affect whether and how broadly a technology might be covered. Virtually no technology is absolutely without risk or totally effectivein all cases. As a general rule in making these coverage decisions, thegreater the risk, the greater the need for proven effectiveness. We havenoted the inter-relationship between the criteria of safety and effectivenessand the nature and severity of the medical condition being treated. Thus,for example, the more severe and life-threatening the condition, the morelikely we are to cover a treatment for which clinical effectiveness hasnot been proven to the usual point of acceptability to us, if there areno other safe and effective treatments available. Similarly, as the levelof demonstrated effectiveness drops, the lower is the threshold of acceptablerisk.F. Publication of National Coverage DecisionsHCFA generally requests OHTA's review of any new Medicare coverage instructionthat is derived from the OHTA assessment process before its publication.HCFA publishes national coverage decisions in the Medicare Coverage IssuesManual (HCFA Pub. 6). In some cases, HCFA may also publish a coverage decisionin other HCFA manuals or as a HCFA Ruling in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. HCFA makes national coverage decisions availablethrough the issuance of a manual instruction or the publication of a HCFARuling in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. We would also rely on the various medical specialtysocieties and organizations to disseminate further this information totheir members through their organizations' journals and publications.Additionally, a listing of all manual instructions (which includes nationalcoverage decisions) will be published in a quarterly <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice in accordance with section 4035(c) ofthe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-203). Section4035(c) requires us to publish quarterly notices that list all manual instructions,interpretative rules, statements of policy, and guidelines of general applicabilitythat implement the Medicare and Medicaid programs.G. Reevaluation and Reconsideration of National Coverage DecisionsIn addition to assessing new services, we might reevaluate a service thatis already excluded or covered under the Medicare program. This might occur,for instance, if in a previous assessment, PHS suggests a reevaluationof a service at a later date. The publication of new clinical studies inthe medical literature may prompt reevaluation of a service especiallyif the findings are not consistent with the existing coverage policy. Thedecison to reevaluate might also occur if a service is considered obsolete.Instances such as these come to our attention in a variety of ways; forexample, from other third party payors, through ongoing review of medicalliterature, or from HCFA central and regional office staff. In all of theseinstances, the same coverage assessment process is followed as is describedabove for evaluation of new services, except that if the decision is towithdraw coverage of a service, we would publish a notice for comment inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> announcing that intent.At any time after publication of a Medicare coverage instruction, interestedparties may request reconsideration and submit evidence demonstrating thata reassessment of that coverage decision is warranted. A reassessment wouldordinarily only be done if there is acceptable information or evidenceavailable that was not available at the time the most recent assessmentwas performed. In particular, since an extensive medical literature searchwas performed in preparation for the initial decision, the documentationfor reconsideration would ordinarily include evidence published later thanthat available at the time of the initial coverage decision. As discussedabove, certain types of evidence carry more weight than others in makingan assessment of safety and effectiveness. This would also be true of evidencesubmitted for reconsideration of a coverage decision.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulation Provisions of this Proposed Rule</ITAG>A. Reason for Codifying the Coverage Decisions ProcessAlthough the process by which we make Medicare coverage decisons on healthcare technology has been in place for many years, we believe there aresegments of the population that may still benefit from a complete descriptionof the coverage decisionmaking process. We also believe the process shouldbe more open and that the review of breakthrough technologies should bestreamlined. It is for these reasons that we are now presenting the coveragedecisions process as a public document.B. Definitions of Commonly Used TermsWe would define the terms ``effective'', ``experimental'', ``health caretechnology'', ``national coverage decision'', and ``safe'' for the purposesof coverage of health care technology under the Medicare program (andSection;400.202).These definitions would not apply to the activities of other organizationalcomponents of the Department.C. Cost-effectiveness as an Additional Criterion for Medicare Coverageof Medically Reasonable and Necessary Services In section II. E. of the preamble, we identified the criteria we currentlyapply when making national coverage decisions (safety, effectiveness, experimentalor investigational considerations, and appropriateness). Also, for eachcriterion we provided a detailed, although not exhaustive, list of questionswe consider in reaching a national coverage decision. In section V. C.of the preamble, we identified and explained the criteria that Medicarecontractors currently apply when making coverage decisions in the absenceof national coverage decisions by HCFA. In addition to these criteria,we propose that HCFA and Medicare contractors consider the cost-effectivenessof a service when making coverage decisions (andSection; 405.380). Traditionally,HCFA has interpreted the terms ``reasonable and necessary'' contained insection 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act to mean that a service is safe, effective,and widely accepted in the medical community. HCFA is including cost-effectivenessas a proposed criterion because we believe considerations of cost are relevantin deciding whether to expand or continue coverage of technologies, particularlyin the context of the current explosion of high-cost medical technologies.We believe the requirement of section 1862(a)(1) that a covered servicebe ``reasonable'' encompasses the authority to consider cost as a factorin making Medicare coverage determinations.The proper role for cost-effectiveness considerations is an important matter.Cost-effectiveness is one of several potential factors to be weighed ina given situation. In many cases, it may have no bearing at all on ourconclusion. However, if a service were to be viewed as marginal with respectto safety and effectiveness, but expensive in comparison with availablecovered alternatives, we think that cost-effectiveness considerations areappropriate. In this instance, however, outright exclusion from coveragemight not be appropriate. To clarify the use of cost-effectiveness as acriterion for coverage as compared to using cost-effectiveness as a criterionfor a payment decision, we offer the following example of one possibleuse of cost-effectiveness as a criterion for a payment decision. Considerthe case of a service that is closely comparable with respect to the risksassociated with its use and its effectiveness to another already coveredservice, but the new service is substantially more expensive than the onethat is already covered. In this situation, we may wish to cover the newservice, while providing the results of our cost-effectiveness evaluationto the payment policy staff and/or Medicare contractors for their use inestablishing payment levels. For example, when a claim is filed for durablemedical equipment containing features of a nature that are not requiredby a patient's condition, or when there exists a reasonably feasible andmedically appropriate alternative pattern of care that is less costly thanthat furnished, the amount payable is based on the reasonable cost of theleast expensive alternative treatment that appropriately meets the patients'needs.Formal cost-effectiveness analysis is an analytic tool that seeks to comparethe incremental cost with the additional effectiveness of the procedureor technology. Beneficial effects are usually quantified in nonmonetaryterms (for example, increased years of life or reduced infection ratesper patient), while costs or savings (both medical and nonmedical) areexpressed in dollars. We are aware that cost-effectiveness analysis isa complex field that suffers from data limitations and the inability toquantify some costs. Specifically, for many new technologies, accuratemeasures of patient benefits or economic impacts (for example, incrementalhospital costs) are imprecise because the device or procedure has not beenused on many patients. Furthermore, even when data are available, methodologicaldifficulties (for example, selecting a method for projecting future costs)and inherent subjectivity can seriously hamper analysis.We may not consider cost-effectiveness in every coverage decision. Forexample, if there is a significant breakthrough or lifesaving technologyfor which there is no comparable alternative, we could not attempt a comparisonto other available technologies since none exist. Another example is considerationof the provisions of section 1861(t)(2) of the Act (as added by section202(a)(2)(C) of Pub. L. 100-360). That section provides Medicare Part Bcoverage of outpatient prescription drugs, biological products, and insulinwhich are not presently covered as part of, or as incident to, other coveredservices. Coverage for this new benefit is effective for drugs used inimmunosuppressive therapy and drugs that are intravenously administeredto an individual in the home beginning January 1, 1990, and for other coveredoutpatient prescription drugs beginning January 1, 1991. Specifically,section 1834(c)(5)(C) of the Act (as added by section 202(b)(4) of Pub.L. 100-360), prohibits the exclusion from coverage or denial of paymentof a covered outpatient drug or class of outpatient drugs, or of any specificuse of such a drug for a specific indication, unless the exclusion is basedon a finding by the Secretary that the use is not safe and effective. Webelieve the Act precludes the application of the cost-effectiveness criterionto covered outpatient drugs, and we do not plan to apply the cost-effectivenesscriterion to those drugs, although we request comment on the issue.We believe that a disciplined effort to assess systematically the cost-effectivenessof technologies under coverage review will be useful. We propose to usea flexible definition of cost-effectiveness that encompasses a wide rangeof impacts: Cost-effectiveness means having improved health outcomes forMedicare patients that justify additional expenditures. In this regard,we would consider a technology cost-effective if, based on analysis, itdemonstrated one of the following results:andbullet; It is less costly and at least as effective as an alternativecovered technology. andbullet; It is more effective and more costly than a covered alternative,but improved health outcomes justify additional expenditures. andbullet; It is less effective and less costly than an existing alternative,but is a viable alternative for some patients. To establish the cost-effectiveness of any intervention, we propose tofollow a standard set of analytical steps that are well accepted amongeconomists. These steps are: andbullet; Identify the relevant alternative technologies to which the currentintervention is to be compared. andbullet; Identify all the relevant outcomes from the alternative technologiesand, when possible, quantify them. These may include clinical outcomessuch as reduced morbidity and mortality, or qualitative outcomes such asreduced pain, enhanced personal well being, vigor, etc. andbullet; Identify all the relevant costs expected (both Medicare and non-Medicare)from the interventions, including direct medical costs or savings and indirectcosts such as enhanced productivity for the disabled, transportation, etc.These will generally be valued in dollars at standard levels relevant tothe Medicare program (for example, Part B charge payments or Part A DRGoutlays). andbullet; Consider nonquantifiable factors. Since all technology impactscannot be fit into a conventional cost-effectiveness formula, the rangeof nonquantifiable factors (for example, ease of use, and access to ambulatorysetting) should be described and considered as modifiers of the analysis.We believe the regular application of these principles by HCFA, as wellas by those proposing new technologies for coverage, would vastly improveour knowledge base and be a deterrent to coverage of procedures that maybe costly, but have little or no impact on improving health outcomes. Toaid in this process, HCFA's Office of Research and Demonstrations is planninga study to develop an approach for collecting and analyzing primary andsecondary data for cost-effectiveness considerations. Based on this studyand a review of other existing studies and models, a methodology wouldalso be developed for making periodic policy decisions based on cost-effectivenessconsiderations. We specifically invite the public to comment on cost-effectivenessmethodologies that could be appropriate for Medicare's use. D. Procedures for Medicare Contractors in Making Coverage Decisions We would establish a new andSection;405.381 and outline the procedures Medicarecontractors would follow in making coverage decisions. The regulationswould set forth contractor responsibilities, including the review of individualclaims and making coverage decisions in the absence of national coveragedecisions by HCFA. E. HCFA Procedures for Making National Coverage Decisions We have set forth the key criteria and procedures in the coverage decisionsprocess (andSection;andSection; 405.380 and 405.382) by which, under seciton1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act, we make coverage decisions that are nationalin their scope and application. As stated earlier, our purpose is to clarifyand inform the public regarding the grounds on which we conclude that anational coverage decision is warranted, the sources of information weuse in making these decisions, and the public's opportunity to participatein the process and be informed of its results.   F. Carrier Coverage ProcessWe are proposing a process for carriers to use in developing utilizationreview policy. This process would include notifying the appropriate groupsof a proposed policy and the need for and basis of establishing it andsoliciting comments from them prior to its implementation.G. Conforming ChangesWe also would amend the title and authority citation to Part 405, SubpartD to conform to the new sections being added.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Relationship With Other Agencies</ITAG>Following is a broad overview of the mission of other agencies and a descriptionof our relationship with them as it applies to the coverage decisionmakingprocess.A. Food and Drug AdministrationFDA protects the public health of the nation as it may be impaired by foods,drugs, biological products, cosmetics, medical devices, radiological products,poisons, pesticides, and food additives. FDA's regulatory functions areto assure that: Foods are safe, pure, and wholesome; drugs, medical devices,and biological products are safe and effective; cosmetics are harmless;all of the above are honestly and informatively packaged; and that exposureto potentially injurious radiation is minimized. The participation of FDAis critical to the Medicare coverage process since, as discussed earlier,FDA approval of drugs, devices, and equipment must precede Medicare coveragein many cases. FDA staff regularly attend HCFA Physicians Panel meetingsin an advisory capacity. Likewise, we monitor FDA advisory panel meetingsand attend those that relate to potential Medicare coverage issues.B. Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC)ProPAC was established by Congress when legislation authorizing implementationof the Medicare prospective payment system was enacted. ProPAC was establishedas a permanent, independent commission with responsibilities related tomonitoring and making recommendations relative to improvements in the prospectivepayment system.ProPAC has two primary responsibilities. The first is to recommend annuallyto the Secretary of HHS the appropriate percentage change in Medicare paymentsfor inpatient hospital care. The second is to consult with and recommendto the Secretary necessary changes in classification and weighting of diagnosis-relatedgroups (DRGs) based on scientific evidence available on the impact of newtechnologies. All national coverage decisions that potentially affect prospectivepayment rules or rates are routinely referred to ProPAC for its reviewand comment prior to publishing the decisions as notices in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and later as instructions in the Medicare CoverageIssues Manual (HCFA Pub. 6) or other HCFA manuals, or as HCFA Rulings inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>.C. National Institutes of HealthNIH serves as the principal biomedical research agency of the Federal Government.Through the support and promotion of biomedical research, NIH seeks toimprove the health of the American people by: Increasing the understandingof the processes underlying human health, disability, and disease; advancingknowledge concerning the health effects of interactions between man andthe environment; developing methods of preventing, detecting, diagnosing,and treating disease; and disseminating research results for critical reviewand, ultimately, medical application. In the pursuit of this mission, NIHsupports biomedical and behavioral research in this country and abroad,conducts research in its own laboratories, trains promising young researchers,and promotes the acquisition and distribution of medical knowledge.With its budget for development of new technologies and treatment, NIHis a major supporter of clinical trials, a key component of the technologyassessment process. NIH also sponsors and coordinates consensus developmentconferences through its Office of Medical Applications of Research (OMAR).These conferences are routinely attended by HCFA staff because they dealwith technologies that, for the most part, have passed the investigationalstage and have diffused into practice. OMAR directs questions on technologiesbeing investigated for Medicare coverage to the knowledgeable institutewhere the latest available information on that issue can be syntheseizedquickly. OMAR staff regularly attend our Physicians Panel meetings andinform Panel members of current and future consensus conferences on varioustopics that might be of interest to the Medicare population. HCFA and OHTAstaff often exchange information with NIH staff on current medical developments.Further, OHTA often uses NIH resources as a source of expert opinion onvarious services under study.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Contractor Functions and the Claims Process</ITAG>A. GeneralAs explained above, the Medicare program covers many medical and healthcare services, supplies, and procedures in use today, subject to establishedcoverage criteria_the exclusions and limitations in the statute, regulations,and administrative instructions described in section I of this preamble.The claims review process for the Medicare program is designed to identifyservices that may not be covered. Resolving these issues is usually a matterof deciding whether the service, either in or by itself or under the specificcircumstances of a particular use, statisfies the established coveragecriteria.B. Contractor FunctionsThe separation of the Medicare program into an institutional component(Part A) and a noninstitutional component (Part B) was patterned aftera program alignment used by Blue Cross/Blue Shield Associations in payingfor services to their subscribers. In order to assure that the Federalhealth insurance program would benefit from the longstanding experienceof health insurance carriers in the private sector, the Secretary decidedthat most claims-processing and administrative functions for both PartA and Part B of Medicare should be handled by public or private insuranceorganizations (commercial insurers or Blue Cross/Blue Shield Associations)acting as fiscal agents or contractors for the Medicare program.The contractors responsible for the administration of hospital insuranceor Part A benefits are termed fiscal intermediaries. The major role ofthe intermediaries is to review and pay claims submitted by providers (suchas hospitals, SNFs, and HHAs) for covered services furnished to beneficiaries.The intermediary makes payments for inpatient services under the prospectivepayment system and makes payments for outpatient services by reviewingsubmitted cost reports and making reasonable cost determinations followingpolicies set by HCFA.Under Part B, the contractors are called carriers. Since Part B servicesare reimbursed primarily on a reasonable charge (as opposed to reasonablecost or the prospective payment system) basis, one of the major functionsof carriers is to determine the reasonable charges in their respectiveareas for each medical care service paid for under the program. Carriersalso are responsible for reviewing and paying claims to or on behalf ofbeneficiaries for the services provided.The functions performed by Medicare fiscal intermediaries and carriersinclude utilization review, beneficiary hearing and appeals, professionalrelations, and statistical activities, in addition to claims review andprocessing. Currently, there are 48 carriers, 57 intermediaries, and someHMOs and CMPs under contract with HCFA that perform reviews and processclaims for their Medicare members. In addition to these contractors, wealso contract with PROs.Before describing the functions of PROs, it is necessary to provide a briefhistory of utilization review under Medicare. In designing the Medicareprogram, Congress was concerned about controlling the costs of the programand ensuring that Medicare beneficiares received only those services thatwere medically necessary. However, Congress also wanted to assure thatjudgements regarding the medical necessity of specific services would bebased on the specific knowledge, skills, and experience that only physiciansand related health practitioners could provide. Therefore, Congress initiallyrequired that hospitals and SNFs have utilization review committees, staffedby physicians, to review the admissions, duration of stay and professionalservices furnished to Medicare beneficiaries according to the criteriaof medical necessity and most efficient use of available health facilitiesand services. In 1972, Congress amended the Medicare law to improve themedical review function by establishing a utilization review program thatrelied upon organizations (Professional Standards Review Organizations(PSROs)) outside of the individual facilities serving Medicare beneficiaries.In order to improve further the conduct of medical review of Medicare claims,Congress enacted the Peer Review Improvement Act in 1982 and required theSecretary to contract with PROs, which are private entities composed oflicensed physicians in a geographical area who are engaged in the practiceof medicine and surgery and who represent the practicing physicians inthat area. Currently there are 54 PROs. Subject to the terms of its contract,a PRO is responsible for the review of specified professional activitiesin its area for which payment may be made by Medicare, for the purposeof determining whether: (1) The services are or were reasonable and medicallynecessary; (2) the quality of the services meets or met professionallyrecognized standards of health care; and (3) services that are proposedto be furnished or were furnished on an inpatient basis, could be providedeffectively on an outpatient basis.C. Criteria and Procedures for Contractor Coverage Decisions  Contractors make Medicare coverage decisions within parameters set by statutoryauthority, regulations, and program instructions prepared by HCFA to implementregulations and statutory authority.  If we have issued a national coverage decision, contractors are bound bythat decision. If no national coverage decision has been issued, a contractormust decide whether the service in question appears to be reasonable andnecessary and therefore covered by Medicare.  As stated previously most of the individual claims processed by Medicarecontractors do not raise serious questions about coverage. When questionsof coverage do arise, they relate primarily to whether the service wasmedically necessary for the individual and was furnished in an appropriatemanner and setting, rather than to broader coverage issues. Even when aclaim for a new, or otherwise questionable, service is received, the contractoris authorized to make reasonable and necessary decisions with respect tothe service, in the absence of applicable national policy. These decisionsare usually made in consultation with the contractor's own medical staffand local medical specialty groups. It should be noted that, since eachcontractor makes decisions only for Medicare claims that are submittedto it, coverage of a particular service may vary among contractors. Infact, coverage decisions made by the same contractor may appear to varyfrom claim to claim reflecting relevant differences in the circumstancesin which the service is furnished or the need of the particular patientfor that service. This variation is consistent with the legislative intentthat the administration of the Medicare program take into account bothdifferences in local medical practice and the types of treatment feasibleindividual patient situations.  Over time, written guidelines have been issued to Medicare contractorsto assist them in making initial decisions as to whether, in individualcases, services are reasonable and necessary and therefore covered underMedicare. In addition to considering the criteria that must be consideredwhen making any coverage decision (that is, the service must be safe andeffective, not experimental, and appropriate), Medicare contractors mustdetermine whether the service under consideration is_  andbullet; Medically necessary in the particular case and the duration andfrequency of the use or application of the service are medically appropriate; andbullet; Furnished in accordance with accepted standards of medical practice;andandbullet; Furnished in a setting appropriate to the patient's medical needsand condition (such as inpatient care at a hospital or SNF, outpatientcare at a hospital or physician's office, or home care).D. Appeals Procedures  Sections 1155, 1869, 1876, 1878 and 1879 of the Act authorize administrativeand judicial review for beneficiaries and providers (in certain cases)to challenge certain adverse coverage decisions. Since certain parts ofthese sections are now under review, a detailed description of their applicationis not being presented. Refer to the specific sections of the Act for informationor appeals procedures.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Analysis of and Responses to Public Comments for April 29, 1987Notice  </ITAG>In response to the April 29, 1987 notice that we published in the <T4>Federal Register, we received 62 timely items of correspondence. Ofthese, 30 were identical letters from health professionals and administratorsin facilities providing rehabilitation services, two others were from rehabilitationprofessionals, 10 were from professional associations or councils, sixwhere from Medicare providers (including three from the same provider),three were from law firms, three were from medical equipment suppliers,and one each was from a medical consultant, a management firm, a StateGovernor, a State office for the handicapped, a Medicaid State agency,and a private individual.  </T4>HCFA also received two letters from the Administrative Conference of theUnited States, one of which enclosed an informational outline of a studyof the Medicare coverage decision process that the Administrative Conferencehas commissioned.  Several of the comments referred to the coverage of or payment for specificservices. Because the inent of the notice was to describe the general coveragedecisionmaking process and to solicit comments on that process, we havenot responded to those comments on the coverage or payment of specificservices in this proposed rule.A. Inconsistent Medicare Contractor Decisions  <T3>Comment: </T3>Forty of the 62 commenters (including the 30 identicalpieces of correspondence) suggested that Medicare contractors should nothave the discretion they currently have in making coverage decisions. Theyargued that inconsistencies between the differenct contractors lead toinequitable treatment of beneficiaries.<T3>Response: </T3>We are aware that coverage of a particular service mayvary among contractors. This variation is to be expected, we believe, inview of Congressional intent that the Medicare program be administeredto some extent by numerous contractors who could make decentralized determinationsand take into account differences in local medical practice. We also notethat decisions with respect to some services may appear to vary becausewhat is medically necessary for one patient may not be medically necessaryfor another. Further, we cannot develop guidelines that are sufficientlydetailed to encompass all possible coverage decisions. However, in viewof the number and consistency of the comments on this issue, we believethat we must take certain steps to improve consistency in contractor coveragedecisions. First and foremost, we expect the publication of this proposedrule and subsequent final rule to reduce significantly the inconsistencyin contractor coverage decisions, since, as described in greater detailin our responses to other comments below, we are proposing to define theterms ``safe'' and ``effective'' (andSection; 400.202) when used in the contextof making a national coverage decison on any health care technology, andto specify the criteria and procedures to be applied by contractors inmaking coverage decision (andSection;andSection; 405.380 and 405.381). We alsopropose to convene annually the medical directors and other officers ofall our carriers, intermediaries, and PROs, as well as representativesof our regional offices, to review all aspects of the coverage processincluding recently issued national coverage decisions. Finally, we areproposing a process for contractors to follow in developing utilizaitonreview policy. This should facilitate greater consistency in the standardsand criteria used by all carriers and the program which they follow.B. Define ``Reasonable'', ``Necessary'', and ``Experimental''<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters recommended that we define the terms``reasonable,'' ``necessary,'' ``experimental,'' and other commonly usedterms.<T3>Response: </T3>We partially agree with the commenters and we have includedseveral definitions in these proposed regulation (andSection; 400.202) asthese terms relate to health care technology. Although we do not definespecifically the terms ``reasonable'' and ``necessary,'' we do specifythe criteria that a health care technology would have to meet in orderto be considered reasonable and necessary, as well as how the criteriawould be applied in the coverage decisionmaking process. We believe thatthe uniform application of these definitions and criteria by our contractorswould reduce inconsistencies in their coverage decisions. We also believeit is important to define in regulations the terms ``safe'' and ``effective,''since our definitions differ slightly from those of FDA. That differencehas not been clearly stated in the past, giving the public the impressionthat an FDA finding that a device is safe and effective should be a sufficientbasis for Medicare coverage. As discussed in this preamble, safety andeffectiveness are not the only criteria applied when deciding whether agiven technology can be considered reasonable and necessary. Further, FDAfindings of safety and effectiveness focus on the labeled use of a deviceonly, while our decisions may focus on other uses of a device under averageconditions of use.C. Issue Contractor Criteria for Making Decisions<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters recommended that we issue contractorcriteria for making coverage decisions.<T3>Response: </T3>In view of the comments that inconsistencies in coveragedecisions among Medicare contractors are related in part to a lack of clearcriteria, we propose to define the criteria and their application in regulations(andSection;andSection; 405.380 and 405.381).D. Coverage Criteria<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter, in recommending that our coverage criteriabe explicit, also suggested that we specify that neither experimental statusnor cost is a criterion on which coverage decisions are made. It was arguedthat we cannot use criteria for coverage that extend beyond what the medicalexperts think are reasonable and necessary for an individual's medicalneeds, and that the statute does not authorize us to deny coverage of aservice on the basis that it is experimental or not cost-effective.<T3>Response: </T3>We believe that experimental services cannot be consideredreasonable and necessary since, by definition, their safety and effectivenessare not established. As discussed in this preamble, the reasonable andnecessary language of the law permits the inclusion of costs as a criterionin making Medicare coverage decisions. We invite comments on the issueof cost-effectiveness.E. Absence of Public Input and Comment in the Coverage Process<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters suggested that the public be giventhe opportunity to provide input at every step of the coverage process,while others focused their requests for public input on selected stepsonly.<T3>Response: </T3>While we are in basic agreement with the value of publicinput, we are concerned that public input at every step of the processthrough notice and comment in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>would delay significantly a process that manyof the same commenters argue is already too lengthy. We are interestedin receiving public comment on this issue and specific suggestions on howto balance these two conflicting objectives. Our responses to suggestionsfor public input at specific points in the process follow.<T3>Comment: </T3>It was suggested that the public should have the opportunityto petition us to consider a service for a coverage decision and that weroutinely publish the agendas of HCFA Physicians Panel meetings.<T3>Response: </T3>Under our current process, requests from the generalpublic are handled in the same manner as any other request for a coveragedecision and, if they meet our criteria for a national coverage decision,may be placed on the agenda of the HCFA Physicians Panel for its consideration.We agree that routine publication of the Panel agenda would be desirable.While the fact that we frequently add agenda items 3 to 4 weeks beforethe meeting precludes providing timely notification to the public throughthe <T4>Federal Register, </T4>we plan to identify other more appropriate andtimely vehicles for announcing upcoming HCFA Physicians Panel meeting agendato the public.<T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters expressed concern that there is no assurancethat knowledgeable professionals are involved in the process and suggestedthat a health professional familiar with the particular area of healthcare be a member of the Panel. Other commenters suggested that HCFA PhysiciansPanel meetings be open to public participation.<T3>Response: </T3>As described earlier, the HCFA Physicians Panel hasregular representation from the medical and scientific experts at FDA andNIH to contribute specialized knowledge on all agenda items. In responseto the comments that the Panel meetings be open to the public, we believethat the current HCFA Physicians Panel process should be modified. We dobelieve the functioning of the Panel could be improved by allowing somepublic input. We propose to permit the presentation, by interested parties,of information related to agenda items prior to deliberations by the Panel.We believe this process would assure that the Panel hear from, and havethe ability to submit questions to, a health professional familiar withthe particular area of consideration, while continuing to allow it thenecessary benefits of a closed decisionmaking opportunity. <T3>Comment: </T3>It was suggested we solicit public comments on OHTA assessmentsand coverage recommendations before we make a final coverage decision.<T3>Response: </T3>We are opposed to this suggestion because we believeit would lead to considerable delay in a final decision on Medicare coveragewith no real benefit. The public is given considerable notice and opportunityto provde input to OHTA during OHTA's assessment process. OHTA's recommendationsto HCFA, based on that information, are only a portion of the materialthat is considered by HCFA in arriving at its final decisions on coverageof a specific service. It is at the time of a HCFA decision, not OHTA recommendation,that public comment would have the greatest value for both the commentersand HCFA. As discussed below, HCFA does solicit public comment on its Medicarecoverage decisions through the <T4>Federal Register</T4> when the benefit of public input is sufficientto outweigh the substantial delay of making a final decision. <T3>Comment: </T3>It was also suggested that we make available throughpublic notice and comment all coverage decisions on health care technologybefore issuing them in HCFA manuals. <T3>Response: </T3>We are opposed to this procedure affecting all coveragedecisions, primarily because it would routinely result in substantial delayin the issuance of final coverage decisions. As noted, we do seek publiccomment before finalizing a Medicare coverage decision when we believethat the value gained from the public comment process outweighs the delayin making a final decision. We also have requested comment on our decisionswhen controversy in the scientific community is intense and the impactof the decision on the public and medical community is profound (for example,coverage of heart transplants). Otherwise, we count on gaining the public'sviews on coverage issues through the opportunity provided in the OHTA assessmentprocess, as well as through public participation prior to the HCFA PhysicianPanel deliberations. We believe this approach would provide a mechanismfor informing the public of national coverage decisions on health caretechnology without involving the extensive delay associated with formalnotice and comment rulemaking. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters suggested that we publish coverage decisionson health care technology in medical journals and other publications ofthe health care industry since our manual instructions are not readilyavailable to beneficiaries, practitioners, and providers. <T3>Response: </T3>We agree that our decisions should be more readily available.Therefore, in addition to the publication of quarterly notices in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> listing coverage decisions (andSection; 405.382(g)),we propose to make national coverage decisions available to the publicas soon as they are issued through the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.The various medical specialty societies and organizations can disseminatethis information to their members through the various journals and publicationsof their organizations. Also, we are prepared to work closely with nationalorganizations representing beneficiaries and physicians to apprise theseorganizations of our coverage decisions and to work with them to developeffective means to inform their constituencies about national coveragedecisions and Medicare coverage policy in general.F. Composition of HCFA Physicians Panel<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter suggested that a representative of FDAbe a member of the Physicians Panel. Another commenter suggested that arepresentative from the prepaid health care industry be added.<T3>Response:</T3> At the present time, FDA and NIH staff routinely attendHCFA Physicans Panel meetings and actively participate in discussions.We do not believe that a representative from the prepaid health care industryneeds to be added to the Panel since we do not specifically include representativesof provider groups. The Physicians Panel is composed of staff physiciansand other health professionals in HCFA's central office and counterpartsfrom PHS who have had experience with a variety of health care deliverysystems.G. Time Frame for Process<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters suggested that each step in the processof making national coverage decisions be limited to a certain number ofdays. One commenter also suggested that we establish a two track reviewsystem that distinguishes technologies that have had Federal review basedon documentation of safety and effectiveness from technologies with nosuch review and that the time frame for these two tracks be different.The commenter suggested reviewing devices accepted by FDA following reviewof a PMA or a section 510(k) application supported by clinical data ona faster track.<T3>Response:</T3> We do not believe it would be feasible to place timelimitations on each step of the process. Generally, we cannot anticipatethe documentation needs that may apply at the various stages of the processor predict the time required to gather documentation at each stage. Moreover,the data that must be reviewed and analyzed vary so widely from issue toissue that it is not possible to establish standard time frames. Also,the level of evidence for safety and effectiveness may vary, dependingon whether a device or procedure is a treatment of last resort or otherwiseinvolves new lifesaving techniques. We do, however, agree that our coveragedecisionmaking could be expedited if the service under consideration hasreceived, or is soon expected to receive, FDA acceptance under the PMAor the section 510(k) processes. In that regard, it is our intention toexpedite assessments for breakthrough, well-researched devices and procedures.H. Improving Coordination with FDA.<T3>Comments:</T3> One commenter suggested that for FDA-regulated technologies,HCFA and OHTA review begin when the FDA advisory panel approves a technologysince this panel decision indicates a high likelihood of FDA approval.The commenter believes that by starting HCFA and OHTA reviews at the pointof approval by the FDA advisory panel, delays would be reduced and agencydecisionmaking would be better coordinated.<T3>Response:</T3> We agree with this suggestion but only under certaincircumstances. First, we do not believe that we should review automaticallyevery technology that is favorably reviewed by an FDA advisory panel sincein many cases some of these technologies do not meet our criteria for considerationof a national coverage decision. Second, not all manufacturers would beinterested in having their technology subjected to the Medicare coverageprocess.Consequently, we prefer to consider for a national coverage decision onlythose technologies selected by us or referred to us by physicians, manufacturers,or other interested parties. We are prepared to begin that review followinga favorable FDA advisory panel recommendation, or earlier if warranted,by placing the issue on the agenda of the next available HCFA PhysiciansPanel meeting. Also, so that we can better coordinate our national coveragedecisionmaking process with FDA, we plan to meet with them on a quarterlybasis to discuss issues of mutual concern and to facilitiate our reviewof technologies under FDA review that potentially may affect the Medicarebeneficiary population. We wish to note that we have considered some servicesfor a national coverage decision before they received formal FDA approval.For example, we requested assessments of magnetic resonance imaging andautomatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillators many months before theywere approved for marketing by FDA.I. Coverage Exclusions Deter Research  <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the exclusion of coveragefor a service deters further research into the application of that service,making it more difficult to accumulate the data needed for reconsiderationor reevaluation. <T3>Response: </T3>We recognize that further research may be discouragedif a service is excluded from Medicare coverage, but we cannot approveprocedures or devises lacking evidence of safety and effectiveness simplyin order to provide a basis for developing that evidence. This approachwould be contrary to the statutory provision that we pay only for a servicethat is determined to be ``reasonable'' and ``necessary''.J. Interim Payments during the Coverage Decisions Process <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that we establish an interimcoverage status allowing payment for certain technologies during the coveragedecisions process.<T3>Response: </T3>We are opposed to providing, on an interim basis, anational coverage decision of any service during our coverage decisionsprocess because to do so could pose serious legal and practical problemsunder section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act. Section 1862(a)(1)(a) precludesMedicare payment for a service unless it is reasonable and necessary. Webelieve that reaching an interim decision, which would effectively requireus to determine that the service was reasonable and necessary would, asa practical matter, require us to undertake a level of full review virtuallytantamount to the review required for making a final national coveragedecision before we have the benefit of considering all relevant factors.This procedure would be cumbersome, redundant, and potentially confusingto the public. Moreover, it would place an undue burden on the Medicareprogram, which could essentially be required to surmount a higher hurdleby finding on full review that a service it has approved on an interimbasis as reasonable and necessary does not now meet that standard. On theother hand, we also are opposed to issuing interim noncoverage instructions,since to do so could eliminate the availability of potentially valuableservices to our beneficiaries when there may be some credible indicationsthat the service may meet the reasonable and necessary criteria, at leastin particular circumstances. Consequently, we believe the prudent approachto the interim coverage of issues under national consideration is to leavethe decisionmaking in the hands of the local contractors, who can takeinto account local medical practice and the unique circumstances of anindividual case.K. Carrier Screens<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters raised the issue of contractor ``screens''and objected to the use of screens for coverage decisions and denials withoutexplanations or requests for additional information. Others objected tothe fact that they are generally unaware of these screens and their medicalrationale and thus are unable to tailor their services to beneficiariesto comply with screens that comport with good medical practice.<T3>Response: </T3>In order to facilitate claims processing and identifypossible overutilization, Medicare contractors have developed ``screens''.These screens alert the contractor that services or procedures performedby a provider have exceeded a treatment norm set by the contractor; thatis, it does not fall within a certain predetermined range. When this occurs,the claim for services can then be reviewed more intensely to determineif further medical evidence is necessary to process the claim properly.In general, carriers seek physician consultation from appropriate specialitieswhen developing screens. The policy and related documentation requirementsare then communicated to physicians prior to implementing them. We received comments that some contractors may be developing or applyingthe screens inappropriately. We therefore have proposed a process for contractorsthat would involve the local medical community in the development of utilizationreview policy (andSection; 405.383(a)). This proposed process would applyto the development of new utilization review policy only; it would notapply to any existing utilization review policy. The local medical communitywould be notified of the type of information that would be required tobe submitted with a claim for any service subject to review. However, theywould not be informed of certain operational parameters of the policy,such as the number of claims over a given period of time that would bepaid without manual review, since to do so could encourage over-utilizationbased on the knowledge that claims would not be reviewed. In response to the concerns that some claims are denied inappropriately,we propose to prohibit the denial of claims that are the subject of medicalreview in accordance with a utilization review policy without review ofall relevant information submitted with the claim (andSection; 405.383(b)).L. Monitoring Contractor Performance Comment: One Commenter recommended that we leave our current process unchangedand direct our attention to the reeducation of claims processors and thecareful monitoring of our contractors. Response: We have not accepted this comment. The claims processing personnelof our contractors are educated on an ongoing basis and our contractorevaluation process undergoes constant scrutiny and revision when needed.M. Physician Review of Adverse DecisionsComment: One commenter asked for clarification of the following statementon page 15561 of the April 29, 1987 <T4>Federal Register: </T4>``Only a physician can make an adverse determinationand only after consulation with the attending physician.'' It is unclearto the commenter whether this requirement applies only to PRO decisionsor to decisions made by other contractors as well. The commenter believesthe requirement should apply to all contractors and all aspects of reviewunder the Medicare program. Response: We regret that the notice was not clear concerning this statement.The statement as written relates only to PRO decisions and is based onsection 1154(a)(2) of the Act. The issue is complicated by the fact thatPRO medical necessity decisions are binding on the carriers and intermediaries.However, not all denials are made by the PROs. Except for PRO decisions,there is no statutory requirement that only a physician can make an adversedecision. However, in practice, any claim initially denied by carrier orintermediary review staff generally will be reviewed by qualified medicalreview staff using written guidelines developed by a physician if the denialis appealed or the claim is resubmitted with additional documentation.We believe this process is a reasonable one since mandatory physician reviewof all denials by carriers and intermediaries would be prohibitively expensive.N. Equipment and Coverage for Long Term Disabilities Comment: Several commenters complained that the program does not coverand pay for the latest equipment needed by the long-term disabled individual.Response: It is not clear why commenters believe that long-term disabledindividuals are denied the benefits of the latest and best technology bythe Medicare program. Our program regulations for the coverage of durablemedical equipment (DME) and other medical supplies are the same for allMedicare beneficiaries, whether they are among the long-term disabled,the chronically ill, or the acutely ill. It is true, however, that newequipment might not be covered by Medicare as soon as it is introduced.At a minimum, equipment that requires marketing approval by the FDA mustreceive that approval. In addition, DME must be shown to meet the Medicareprogram's definition of DME, that is, equipment that (1) can withstandrepeated use, (2) is primarily and customarily used to serve a medicalpurpose, (3) generally is not useful to a person in the absence of an illnessor injury, and (4) is appropriate for use in the home. With respect to the concerns expressed about our alleged willingness topay for the ``best'' equipment available (which, in many circumstances,is the most expensive), our policy is a rather straightforward one, andone that we believe does not require revision. An item of durable medicalequipment may have certain convenience or luxury features that make itmore expensive than a standard item; that is, one which will adequatelymeet the medical needs of the patient. The reasonable charge for the moreexpensive item cannot exceed the reasonable charge for the item that isadequate for the patient's medical needs. We will base the reasonable chargefor a covered service on the more expensive model only when the specialfeatures of the more expensive model are medically reasonable and necessaryfor the beneficiary.O. Confidentiality of Data <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that we publish our policieson confidentiality to facilitate submission of sensitive, not-yet-publishedresearch data that document safety and effectiveness. <T3>Response: </T3>HCFA regulations regarding the Freedom of InformationAct appear in 42 CFR Part 401 and supplement the more general Departmentregulations that appear at 45 CFR Part 5. These regulations implement ExecutiveOrder 12600, ``Predisclosure Notification Procedures for Confidential CommercialInformation'', signed June 23, 1987. In accordance with these regulations, to facilitate the identificationof confidential commercial material, organizations are encouraged to markrelevant sections of submitted material (individual pages, reports, charts,etc.) as ``confidential''. Blanket statements claiming that all submittedmaterial is confidential should be avoided. Instead, organizations shouldclearly mark all specific portions of submitted material that in fact containconfidential commercial information. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Proposed Uncodified Changes to the Current Coverage DecisionsProcess </ITAG>As a result of our assessment of necessary revisions and in response tothe public comments we received on the April 29, 1987 <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, we propose to make the following changesin our coverage decisionmaking process, which we believe do not requirecodification in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). A. HCFA Physicians Panel We propose to identify appropriate vehicles for announcing the date, andagenda of upcoming HCFA Physicians Panel meetings. B. Improved Coordination and Communication We propose to convene an annual meeting of the medical directors and otherofficers of all our carriers, intermediaries, HMOs, CMPs, and PROs as wellas representatives of our regional offices, to review all aspects of thecoverage process including recently issued national coverage decisions,This should facilitate and reduce any inconsistencies in the implementationof national coverage decisions and allow for the identification of additionalissues for which national coverage decisions may be warranted. We alsoplan to meet with FDA on a quarterly basis to discuss issues of mutualconcern and to facilitate our review of health care technologies undertheir review that may potentially impact on the Medicare beneficiary population.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Regulatory Impact Statement </ITAG>Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires us to prepare and publish an initialregulatory impact analysis for any proposed regulation that meets one ofthe E.O. criteria for a ``major rule'', that is, that would be likely toresult in : an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; amajor increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,government agencies, or geographic regions; or, significant adverse effectson competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or onthe ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. In addition, we generally prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysisthat is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C.601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulationwould not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. Also, section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act requiresthe Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if the proposed rulemay have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial numberof small rural hospitals. Such an analysis also must conform to the provisionsof section 603 of the RFA. This proposed regulation would specify the process through which we makedecisions as to whether to cover particular services under Medicare. Thesedecisions are published in the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual and maybe published in other HCFA manuals or as HCFA Rulings in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. This proposed regulation would foster the carefulconsideration of available scientific and medical information in the coveragedetermination process. Accordingly, it would serve to ensure that all Medicarecoverage determinations are consistent with our statutory obligations.The coverage decision process set forth in this proposed rule would thusof itself, neither promote nor hinder any specific economic outcomes (asopposed to any particular coverage decision, which might have a substantialeconomic impact). Furthermore, most provisions of this proposed rule conformto the Medicare coverage determination process that has been in place formany years. Therefore this proposed regulation, in itself, would have nodirect effect on the economy or on Federal or State expenditures, and nothreshold criteria under E.O. 12291 would be exceeded. Consequently, aninitial regulatory impact analysis has not been prepared. In addition,we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rulewould not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities, and this proposed rule would not have a significant impacton the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Wehave, therefore, not prepared an initial regulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Information Collection Requirements </ITAG>These proposed changes do not impose information collection requirements.Consequently, they need not be reviewed by the Office of Management andBudget (OMB) under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980(44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.)</T3>. <ITAG tagnum="84">X. Responses to Comments on this Proposed Rule </ITAG>Because of the large number of comments we receive on proposed regulations,we cannot acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, in preparingthe final rule, we will consider all comments received timely and respondto the major issues in the preamble to that rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>42 CFR Part 400 Grant programs_health, Health facilities, Health maintenance organizations(HMO), Medicaid, Medicare, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 42 CFR Part 405 Administrative practice and procedure, Health facilities, Health professions,Kidney diseases, Laboratories, Medicare, Nursing homes, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Rural areas, X-rays.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 42 CFR Chapter IV would be amendedas follows:I. 42 CFR Part 400, Subpart B, is amended as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 400_INTRODUCTION: DEFINITIONS;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Definitions</ITAG>1.

A new undersignated center leading and new andSection;andSection; 405.380through 405.383 are added to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="85">Criteria and Procedures For Making Medical Services Coverage DecisionsThat Relate To Health Care Technology</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 405.380 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Criteria for Medicare coverage of reasonable and necessary services.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General rules and process. </T3>(1) For purposes of this section, theuse of the word ``services'' means health care technologies as definedin $405.202.(2) In the absence of statutory bars, a service is covered by Medicare(under section 1862(a)(1) of the Act) only if the service is reasonableand necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injuryor toimprove the functioning of a malformed body member. In determining whetherthis coverage requirement is met, a service is considered resonable andnecessary with reference to the following criteria if_(i) The service if safe and effective.(ii) The service is not experimental or investigational.(iii) The service is cost-effective.(iv) The service is appropriate.(3) HCFA makes national coverage decisions in accordance with andSection;405.382. Medicare carriers, intermediaries HMOs, CMPs, and PROs make coveragedecisions, in the absence of national coverage decisions by HCFA, in accordancewith andSection; 405.381.(b) <T3>Application of the criteria for making coverage decisions. </T3>Amongthe criteria described in paragraph (a) of this section for making coveragedecisions, safety and effectiveness are the key criteria. A service thatis determined not to be safe and effective is not covered regardless ofwhether it satisfies the other criteria. A service that is determined tobe safe and effective may or may not be covered depending on whether theother criteria are met. In determining whether the criteria are met, wewill consider the following:(1) <T3>Safety and effectiveness. </T3>(i) A service may be determined to besafe and effective if it is generally accepted in the medical communityas safe and effective in the setting and for the condition for which itis used, or proven to be safe and effective based on authoritative evidence.(ii) Even if a service is generally accepted in the medical community assafe and effective for some conditions, evidence may support a conclusionthat the service has not been shown to be safe and effective for all conditions,and in these cased Medicare does not cover the service for those conditions.(iii) To be considered safe and effective, a service must be furnishedin a setting commensurate with the patient's medical needs and condition.(iv) To be considered safe and effective, a service must be furnished bypersonnel who are qualified to furnished the service by virtue of education,training, experience, certification, or licensure.(v) When evaluating breakthrough medical or surgical procedures, the standardsfor safety and effectiveness are less stringent. The more severe and lifethreatening the illness or injury process for which a particular treatmentis applied, the more acceptable a relatively less safe technology may bewhen no safer or more effective technologies are available. In these cases,treatments whose clinical effectiveness has not been conclusively demonstratedmay be determined to be reasonable and necessary if no safer or more effectivetreatments are available. However, in certain cases, we may provide forcoverage but impose such limitations as facility or patient selection criteria,or a provision to later revise a coverage policy based on subsequent datacollection.(vi) Medical devices that have been approved for marketing by FDA on thebasis of a premarket approval application (under 21 U.S.C. 360c) or a section510(k) application submitted with clinical data are considered safe andeffective for Medicare purposes when used for the conditions prescribed,recommended, or suggested in the labeling of the devices.(vii) Drugs and biologicals approved for marketing by FDA are consideredsafe and effective for Medicare purposes when used for indications specifiedin their labeling.(2) <T3>Experimental or investigational considerations.</T3> (i) A servicethat is furnished for research purposes in accordance with predeterminedrules is considered experimental or investigational and is not coveredby Medicare. (ii) Except for certain drugs used in treating terminally ill cancer patientsthat are identified as Group C cancer drugs distributed by the NationalCancer Institute, a drug or biological product that has not been approvedunder a new drug application for marketing by FDA is considered experimentalor investigational by HCFA and is not covered by Medicare. (iii) A medical device that has not been approved by FDA (under 21 U.S.C.360k) is considered experimental or investigational and is not coveredby Medicare. (iv) A service, other than breakthrough medical or surgical proceduresdescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, that is not used widelybecause there is inadequate evidence of safety and effectiveness is consideredexperimental or investigational and is not covered by Medicare. (3) <T3>Cost-effectiveness.</T3> A technology is considered cost-effectiveif it is_ (i) Very expensive to the program, but provides significant medical benefitsnot otherwise available; (ii) Less costly and at least as effective as an alternative covered intervention;(iii) More effective and more costly than a covered alternative, but theadded benefit is significant enough to justify the added cost; and (iv) Less effective and less costly than an existing alternative, but aviable alternative for some patients. (4) <T3>Appropriateness.</T3> (i) A service is considered appropriate if itis furnished in a setting commensurate with the patient's medical needs.(ii) A service is considered appropriate if it is furnished by qualifiedpersonnel. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;405.381 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures for Medicare carriers, intermediaries, HMOs, CMPs, andPROs in making coverage decisions. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Presence of a national coverage decision.</T3> In their review of claimsfor payment, Medicare contractors (carriers, intermediaries, HMOs, CMPs,and PROs) are bound by the statute, regulations, and all HCFA administrativecoverage issuances, including all national coverage decisions.
