Wangler, Chief, RadioactiveMaterials Branch, Technical Division, Office of Hazardous Materials Transportation,U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street, SW, Washington,DC 20590, (202) 366-4545.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> Many countries and international transportorganizations throughout the world have adopted the standards of the IAEA's``Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials'' (IAEA Regulations).These regulations are currently found in IAEA publication Safety SeriesNo. 6, 1985 Edition (SS6-85). Section 171.12(e) of 49 CFR permits the importand export of radioactive materials, under certain conditions, if packagesare prepared for shipment in accordance with the IAEA Regulations. Currently,andSection; 171.21(e) references Safety Series No. 6, 1973 Revised Edition(As Amended). However, the HMR are periodically amended to allow conformancewith most of the IAEA Regulations for domestic transportation. It is anticipatedthat the HMR will be amended to require conformance with SS6-85 by July1, 1990. Thus any changes to SS6-85 may affect the HMR.The IAEA has instituted a new process for the continuing review and revisionof its regulations. This process will lead to supplements to the IAEA Regulationsand its supportive documents being issued every 2 years, thereby allowingthe IAEA Regulations to remain current with technology and needs.As part of this process the IAEA convened a Technical Committee meetingfrom July 10-14, 1989, to consider proposals for amendments and identifiedproblems submitted by IAEA Member States and international organizationsin connection with the IAEA Regulations. Additionally, the Technical Committeeconsidered advice and reports developed by consultant groups examiningspecific aspects of the regulatory standards for transport. The TechnicalCommittee was charged with the tasks of examining the justifications forthe proposed amendments and of recommending changes suitable for earlyadoption in the IAEA Regulations. To ensure that Member States were represented,the Technical Committee consisted of designated representatives of theMember States.As a result of the meeting, the Technical Committee recommended 2 typesof changes: (1) Those that were designated as ``minor changes'' that donot alter the substance of the IAEA Regulations; (2) those that were designatedas ``Changes of Detail.'' Minor changes comprise matters such as editorialcorrections, drafting errors and internal consistencies. The consequentamendment to the IAEA's Regulations for this type of change will be promulgatedin due course without the prior approval of Member States. Changes of Detailare considered to be essential by the IAEA to keep their Regulations current.These changes can only be promulgated by the Director General of the IAEAafter giving Member States not less than 90 days notice to comment on thechanges.The Director General of the IAEA has invoked the 90 day notice procedureand has transmitted the changes to the U.S. and other Member States. Sinceamendments of the IAEA Regulations may have an effect on the HMR, the publicis invited to review the changes and to submit comments on the proposedchanges. To facilitate this process, a copy of the changes has been placedin RSPA's Docket Unit for use by the public. Copies of the proposed changesmay be obtained upon request to the Dockets Unit. Comments submitted bythe public will be considered and incorporated into the U.S. response tothe changes.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC on November 15, 1989, under authority delegatedin 49 CFR part 106, Appendix A.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Alan I.
