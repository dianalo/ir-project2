Its scopeis demonstrated by analysis of a drilling island consisting of a ballastedtank placed on a submerged sand berm. Full interaction including potentialslip between tanker and berm is taken into account. Verification is providedby data from simulated earthquake tests on a centrifuged model. The useof TARA-2 in practical analysis is illustrated by analysing the seismicresponse of an offshore drilling island, typical of those used in theCanadian Beaufort Sea.</TEXT></DOC>
