Meanwhile, Americans' earnings from wages, rents andinvestments went up just 0.2 percent in both March and February, although farmincome in March rose a robust 14.4 percent after increasing 19.2 percent inFebruary, the Department of Commerce said.;    Home purchases and consumerspending patterns are closely watched as indicators of the economy's futuredirection. Consumers account for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activitythrough their purchases of goods and services. But few analysts forecast amajor stimulus from consumer spending in the next few months becauseunemployment is increasing and incomes are not growing briskly.;    &quot;Consumersare burdened with debt and income growth is very weak,&quot; said Cynthia Latta,senior financial economist for DRI/McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. &quot;There's apotential for more layoffs. . . . We are still not looking for a vigorouseconomic recovery.&quot;;    Still, housing analysts were heartened by the Marchfigures, even though the improvement in home sales was due entirely to anincrease in the West, where home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted 155,000units compared to 127,000 in February.;    Experts said that the March rise,although tiny, suggests that February's huge double-digit increase was thebeginning of an industry recovery rather than an aberration.;    &quot;I thinkwe've certainly turned the corner on housing,&quot; said David W. Berson, chiefeconomist at the Federal National Mortgage Association, who had forecast a 1.5percent rise in March sales.;    Berson said that he also was encouraged thathousing sales in the Midwest -- which dipped to 90,000 from 106,000 -- held upin the wake of abnormally high sales activity in February when home purchaseswere aided by mild weather.;    But Berson said that the continued strength ofhome sales, in the wake of sluggish new construction activity, could putsubstantial upward pressure on home prices later in the year. New housingconstruction fell 9.3 percent in March and the inventory of unsold homesshrank to 7.5 months' supply at the current sales pace.;    &quot;With constructionlagging behind sales, home prices have the potential to go up significantly,&quot;Berson said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910430  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  496  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday April 30, 199100121121,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
