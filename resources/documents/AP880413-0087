In a surprise announcement Tuesday, a Frankfurt state court saidHamadi's brother, Mohammed Hamadi, will be tried in a juvenilecourt.   That decision means Mohammed Hamadi, charged with murder and airpiracy in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jet, faces a maximum 10-yearprison sentence if convicted. An adult court could sentence him toa possible life term upon conviction.   Abbas Hamadi is accused of kidnapping two West Germans inLebanon in January 1987 allegedly to force West Germany to free hisbrother.   ``I had no direct or indirect involvement in the kidnappings,''Abbas Hamadi told the five-judge panel Tuesday after his attorneysconcluded their final arguments.   Earlier, defense counsel Ludwig Hoeller told the court that hisclient did not contest charges of possessing explosives. Herecommended that Hamadi be sentenced to one year in prison butadded that Hamadi should be released immediately because already hehas served more than a year in investigative custody.   Prosecutors last week asked for a prison sentence of 11{ yearson kidnapping, coercion and explosives charges.   A verdict is expected next week.   Hamadi is charged with kidnapping West German businessmen RudolfCordes and Alfred Schmidt in Beirut in 1987.   Cordes was seized at Beirut Airport on Jan. 17, 1987 and Schmidtwas abducted from his Beirut hotel room three days later. Schmidtwas released last September in what his captors called a ``goodwillgesture,'' while Cordes remains in captivity.   ``Much of the evidence against my client is based on testimonyfrom witnesses of dubious credibility, on hearsay, and oninterrogations that were conducted improperly,'' chief defensecounsel Eckart Hild Hild said earlier Tuesday.   Federal Prosecutor Karl-Heinz Schnarr said evidence, includingwiretaps and fingerprints, proved conclusively that Abbas Hamadiwas involved in the kidnappings.   The abductions came shortly after Mohammed Hamadi was arrestedat Frankfurt Airport on Jan. 13, 1987 carrying liquid explosives.Abbas Hamadi was arrested in Frankfurt on Jan. 26, 1987.   Mohammed Hamadi was charged in February with murder, hijacking,hostage-taking and other crimes stemming from the June 1985hijacking of a TWA jetliner to Beirut, during which a U.S. Navydiver was killed and 39 U.S. citizens held hostage for 17 days.   A Frankfurt state court on Tuesday said Mohammed Hamadi would betried in a youth court because ``the perpetration of the crime''may have begun before he was age 21. The statement said the stateprosecutor's office in Frankfurt listed Mohammed Hamadi's birthdate as June 13, 164.   ``The state court has studied this case intensively and isconvinced that it belongs in the juvenile court,'' Hesse statecourt spokesman Thomas Kehren said.   It is possible that the juvenile tribunal declines the case,``but that is highly unlikely under the circumstances,'' Kehrentold The Associated Press in a telephone interview.   Under West German law, defendants age 21 or older at the time ofthe crime are considered adults, those between 18 and 21 areadolescents, and those under age 18 are juveniles. Adolescents aswell as juveniles are tried in juvenile courts.</TEXT></DOC>
