House Banking Chairman Henry Gonzales (D., Texas), worriedabout the shrinking bank deposit insurance fund, wants torush through a limited plan to recapitalize the fund. Hewould have lawmakers consider broader reform later.</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday Mr. Gonzales and Rep. Frank Annunzio (D., Ill.)introduced a bill that would give the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. authority to borrow up to $25 billion for theinsurance fund, impose new accounting standards on banks,allow regulators to close banks before they are totallyinsolvent, and bar the FDIC from paying off uninsureddeposits after 1995.   The Bush administration wants a broader bill that wouldgive banks permission to operate nationwide branch networksand affiliate with brokerage and other financial servicesfirms.   There is considerable opposition among committeeRepublicans and Democrats alike to the narrow bill introducedby Messrs. Gonzalez and Annunzio. But while there seems to besome support for nationwide branching, there isn't yetagreement on what a broad bill would include.   Rep. Chalmers Wylie (R., Ohio), the banking committee'sranking Republican, also will attend next week's meeting withMessrs. Brady and Gonzales. The session could be the openinground of discussions that would lead to a broader bill. &quot;Theadministration is going to have to give . . . and we aregoing to have to give,&quot; Mr. Gonzalez said.   However, he noted that a new General Accounting Officeaudit of the bank insurance fund increases pressure for quickaction to recapitalize the fund. Preliminary results of theGAO audit suggest that the fund's balance is several billiondollars less than the $7 billion the FDIC calculates. Theadministration has proposed a plan to open credit lines of$79 billion for the fund. The borrowings would be repaid frompremiums the banking industry pays on domestic deposits.</TEXT></DOC>
