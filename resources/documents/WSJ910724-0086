The decision by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsapplies only to countries that have signed extraditiontreaties with the U.S. In its 2-to-1 opinion, the court saidthat such treaties -- allowing the transfer of defendantsfrom one country to another for trial -- must be understoodto ban government-sponsored kidnappings. However, hostnations can waive the ban by consenting to an abduction.</LP><TEXT>   That means that Rene Martin Verdugo-Urquidez, a Mexicannational who was brought to this country and convicted inconnection with the 1985 murder of a U.S. drug agent, will beentitled to a federal court hearing into whether hisgovernment consented to the transfer. If not, he may be ableto demand repatriation.   Although the ruling in the Verdugo-Urquidez case isn'tbinding outside the nine Western states covered by the 9thCircuit, it may signal an increased resistance by courts tothe practice of kidnapping foreigners for trial in U.S.criminal courts without the permission of their governments,lawyers said.   Some lawyers said the Ninth Circuit decision could have animpact on the case of former Panamanian dictator Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega, who is currently facing narcotics charges infederal court in Florida. Gen. Noriega was brought to theU.S. after surrendering to forces that invaded his country in1989.   That situation is different from the one considered by theNinth Circuit, because there wasn't any evidence thatPanama's new rulers protested the U.S.'s move. But a lawyerfor Mr. Verdugo-Uriquidez said that courts could recognize anexception &quot;when this country basically topples&quot; the existingforeign government.   &quot;Who is left to protest in such a case?&quot; asked PatrickHall, of the San Diego law firm of Goldberg, Frant andamp; Hall,who represented Mr. Verdugo-Urquidez. &quot;If I were Noriega, I'dfile an official protest right now as the government in powerat the time. The court would probably laugh at that, but itwould be an imaginative attempt to fit into the precedent ofthis case,&quot; Mr. Hall said.   Mr. Noriega's lawyers were in court yesterday and couldn'timmediately be reached for comment.   In the past, courts generally didn't inquire into themeans by which a foreign defendant arrived on U.S. soilunless it was clear that the method of transfer &quot;shocked theconscience,&quot; said Neal Sonnett, a Miami criminal defenselawyer. Mr. Sonnett noted that citizens of other countriesare brought to trial in this country as often as a dozentimes a year, but only a few cases receive public notice.   The Verdugo-Uriquidez case was the first to raise theissue of what happens when a foreign country protests atransfer. After he was seized, the Mexican goverment lodgedwhat it termed &quot;a formal complaint&quot; with U.S. authorities.   Mr. Sonnett said that in most cases, the foreign countrycooperates with the U.S. government or at least remainssilent. Even so, he said, the Ninth Circuit's decision willlimit the ability of the U.S. government to send strikeforces into other countries without contacting them. &quot;Somesenators have argued that we ought to send troops intoColombia and snatch drug lords. Clearly, under this decisionthey couldn't do that,&quot; Mr. Sonnett said.   ---   SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS pension fund comes under attack fromtwo ministers.   The Rev. Thomas Basich and his son, the Rev. MatthewBasich, pastors of Advent Lutheran Church in St. Paul, Minn.,are seeking the right to remove their accumulated pensionfunds from the $2 billion pension plan of the EvangelicalLutheran Church in America, in a lawsuit filed in state courtin Minneapolis.   In what appears to be an unprecedented case, the twoclergymen assert that church officials are pursuing&quot;socio-political&quot; investment policies with the pension fund-- such as shedding holdings in companies doing business inSouth Africa. As a result, the pastors say, the fund isn'tbeing managed in the best financial interests of its members.   &quot;It's our position that this is harming the pension fund,&quot;said Robert C. Bell, an attorney with Peterson, Bell,Converse andamp; Jensen of St. Paul, which represents the Basiches.He said the complaint asks the court to grant all 42,000members of the pension fund &quot;portability&quot; -- that is, theoption of moving their accumulated pension money to anotherfund of their choosing. A request by the Basiches that theybe allowed to move their money to another fund was denied bythe church Board of Pensions in April.   The suit names both the 5.3 million-member church and itsBoard of Pensions as defendants, seeking unspecified damagesfrom each.   &quot;It's the first time that I'm aware of that someone hassued or taken an action against a plan for being sociallyconscious,&quot; said Howard Weizmann, executive director of theAssociation of Private Pension and Welfare Plans inWashington, D.C. &quot;It's usually the reverse that's happening,&quot;he added, with pension-plan members suing to force a plan tomake more socially conscious investments.   Mr. Bell said the case and the issue of portability have&quot;a broad application&quot; for other pension funds run by localgovernments, labor unions and other organizations.   But John Harris, an attorney with Faegre andamp; Benson inMinneapolis, which is representing the pension board, said adecision to allow ministers to withdraw from the fund couldbe made only by the church. &quot;There is no court case of whichI am aware in which a court has ruled that a {pension} planmember may withdraw from a plan&quot; that does not make aprovision for such individual withdrawals, he said.   ---   INVESTMENT ADVISER who squandered clients' money seeks newsentence.   David Bloom, 26 years old, has been in prison sinceJanuary 1989 serving an eight-year sentence, one of thetoughest penalties to come out of the Wall Street scandals ofthe 1980s. In federal appeals court in Manhattan yesterday,Mr. Bloom's attorney argued that the case should have fallenunder the federal sentencing guidelines, which he said wouldhave resulted in a prison term of 30-37 months.   Mr. Bloom made headlines in 1988 when he was charged withusing most of the $15 million that investors turned over tohim to buy expensive paintings, real estate and luxuryautomobiles for himself. Mr. Bloom pleaded guilty to twocounts of fraud in May 1988 and agreed to make restitution.   Gerald Lefcourt, Mr. Bloom's attorney, said the caseshould have been covered by the sentencing guidelines,because the allegations continued past Nov. 1, 1987, when theguidelines took effect. But the government argued that Mr.Bloom only admitted to specific allegations occurring beforethat date.   The difference could greatly affect the actual time Mr.Bloom will serve behind bars. Typically, defendants inpreguidelines cases must serve two-thirds of the sentencebefore coming up for parole, which in Mr. Bloom's case wouldbe 64 months. Sentences under the guidelines are for &quot;realtime&quot; in prison.   ---   FIRST WOMAN managing partner named at Mayer, Brown andamp;Platt.
