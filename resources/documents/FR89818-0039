[<T4>Federal Register</T4>, July 10, 1989, 54 FR 20978] <ITAG tagnum="84">The Regulation </ITAG>The applicable portions of current andSection; 121.358 require that, ``afterJanuary 2, 1991, no person may operate a turbine-powered airplane unlessit is equipped with an approved system providing airborne windshear warningwith flight guidance.'' However, this section also states that a certificateholder may obtain an extension of this date, ``for airplanes manufacturedbefore January 2, 1989, if it obtains FAA approval of a retrofit schedule.''To obtain an extended compliance date, the certificate holder would haveto show that ``at least 50 percent of those airplanes manufactured beforeJanuary 2, 1989, will be equipped by January 2, 1991, at least 25 percentmore of those airplanes will be equipped by January 2, 1992, and all ofthe remaining airplanes which are required to be equipped in accordancewith this section by January 4, 1993.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>On June 1, 1987, the FAA published NPRM No. 79-11A, Airborne Low-AltitudeWindshear Equipment and Training Requirements (52 FR 20560); the commentperiod closed September 28, 1987. The final rule was issued September 22,1988, and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 28, 1988 (53 FR 37688). On March 17, 1989, the ATA submitted to the FAA comments concerning theFAA's windshear rule. Included with these comments were studies concerningthe retrofit of airborne windshear warning and flight guidance equipmenton older airplanes. On June 1, 1989, the ATA petitioned the FAA to amendthe windshear equipment rule to repeal the requirement that older airplanesbe retrofitted with the flight guidance systems. In its petition, the ATAincluded the studies it had submitted to the FAA on March 17, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>The ATA petition speaks of windshear ``alerting'' equipment.For the sake of consistency, this notice will use the term ``warning''as is found in the windshear rule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of the Proposals </ITAG><T3>Retrofitting older airplanes with windshear flight guidance.</T3> TheATA asserts that the studies submitted to the FAA support the premise thatthere may be no benefit provided from retrofitting windshear flight guidanceinto older airplanes. For the purpose of this proposal, older airplanesinclude, but are not limited to, the DC-9, B-727, and certain airplanesin the B-737 and B-747 series. This term, older airplanes, comprises about48% of the commercial fleet. These airplanes were manufactured withoutthe means to easily install windshear flight guidance equipment; thus,in many cases, they cannot be retrofitted without substantial installationcosts. Newer airplanes, such as those listed in the proposal, are manufacturedwith the capability to easily install windshear flight guidance equipmentwithout major retrofitting. ATA's petition asserts that the studies providedto the FAA show that in the case of older airplanes, windshear warningsystems coupled with pilot training using the Windshear Training Aid \1\<NOTE/> and flight simulators help pilots to avoid or recover froma windshear encounter in a manner equal to or better than piloting proceduresbased on windshear warning systems and escape flight guidance. Studiesto which ATA makes reference conclude: (1) That training with the WindshearTraining Aid is retained well; and (2) that recovery capability does notdepend on the pilot's ability to precisely execute windshear recovery techniques.Further, ATA asserts that, because certain windshear warning and flightguidance systems currently in use on older aircraft require a windshearwarning before providing flight guidance, pilots are likely to wait forthe warning and guidance, relying completely on the windshear equipment,instead of initiating avoidance procedures immediately upon early windshearrecognition.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ In 1986, the FAA contracted with aviation specialistsfrom the Boeing Company, United Airlines, McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed-California,Aviation Weather Associates, and Helliwell, Inc. to produce a trainingaid on flight procedures to help pilots avoid or recover from encounterswith windshear. The information included in the attachment to the ATA petition representsa substantial effort to study the effectiveness of the Windshear TrainingAid and whether retrofitting older airplanes with windshear flight guidanceis warranted. The FAA is not aware of data that refutes ATA's studies orattempts to quantify the economic benefits of the individual componentsof the windshear final rule, i.e., training, windshear warning, and windshearflight guidance. Therefore, the FAA concludes that the portion of ATA'spetition concerning the retrofit of older airplanes may have merit. The FAA solicits specific comments on the following issues raised in theATA petition: (1) The claim that, because certain airborne windshear systemsin older aircraft require a windshear warning before providing flight guidance,pilots are likely to wait for the warning and guidance instead of initiatingavoidance procedures upon early windshear recognition as trained; (2) pilotretention of windshear escape and avoidance procedures; and (3) whetherthe list of airplanes in this proposal that would be required to have windshearflight guidance systems should be modified. The above requests for specific comments are designed to solicit commentson issues raised by ATA's petition. The FAA is aware, however, that otherissues may be equally important to commenters. Therefore, interested personsare invited to submit comments concerning other relevant issues. The FAA has determined that airborne low-altitude windshear equipment providesa positive safety benefit. Concerning older airplanes, an additional issueis the appropriate means of achieving that benefit. The ATA asserts thatfor older airplanes windshear warning and training, without flight guidance,is more efficient, because windshear flight guidance on older airplanesdoes not provide a sufficient increase in safety to warrant the cost ofretrofitting. The FAA recognizes that so long as the safety benefits areequal, it is in the public interest to obtain those benefits at the lowestavailable cost. The FAA further notes that the shorter life span and theexpense and problems of upgrading and maintaining aging airplanes in generalmay not warrant windshear flight guidance system installations for thoseairplanes. This concern is reflected in the proposed NPRM, which does notrequire air carriers to retrofit older airplanes with windshear flightguidance. Thus, the FAA solicits public comment on whether older airplanesshould be exempt from the windshear flight guidance equipment requirement.Included in ATA's proposed amendment is a subsection concerning performancestandards for the development of windshear flight guidance systems. TheATA requested approval guidelines for: (1) Automatic windshear warningand flight guidance systems that are fully integrated into flight guidancecomputers; and (2) windshear warning and flight guidance systems that arenot integrated into flight guidance computers and that require a windshearwarning or pilot action to initiate flight guidance. In addition, the FAAhas determined that the development of guidelines for airborne windsheardetection and avoidance systems \2\<NOTE/> (predictive systems) should be developed.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Windshear detection and avoidance systems are expectedto provide windshear warnings early enough so that a pilot can completelyavoid windshear encounters. At this time, these predictive systems arenot available. The FAA recognizes the need for such standards and solicits specific commentson what criteria are necessary in the area of flight guidance performance.Based on these comments the FAA may issue or revise appropriate guidancematerial.<T3>Compliance Schedules.</T3> The proposed rule would permit a certificateholder to obtain an extension of the windshear equipment compliance date.However, unlike the current rule, the proposal would not require certificateholders to submit schedules demonstrating that certain percentages of theirfleets will be in compliance on particular dates. Rather, certificate holderswould be required to be in full compliance on a specific date, and wouldbe required to submit status reports every 6 months showing the progressmade. The purpose of the proposed amendment is to allow certificate holdersto retrofit required airborne windshear equipment by using the same complianceschedule established for the retrofit of Traffic Alert and Collision AvoidanceSystem II (TCAS II) equipment. While developing the windshear final rule, the FAA was also developinga rule requiring the installation of TCAS II equipment on large passengercarrying aircraft. The Airway Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1987required that TCAS II equipment be installed on all large passenger carryingaircraft by December 30, 1991. Due to reported testing and installationproblems, legislation has been introduced to extend the compliance dateby allowing air carriers to install TCAS II equipment in accordance witha phased schedule. This legislation, if adopted, would also require thatthe Administrator consider amending the schedule for the installation ofairborne windshear warning and flight guidance systems. The FAA believesthat it will be more efficient if the industry were required to have onlyone cycle of disassembly and reassembly during which both systems are installed.This would preclude a second, out-of-service period for retrofit. <T3>Windshear Detection and Avoidance Systems (Predictive Systems).</T3>The FAA also takes this opportunity to propose an amendment to the windshearequipment rule so that the use of approved windshear detection and avoidancesystems (predictive systems) is allowed by the rule when such equipmentbecomes available. Therefore, the FAA proposes to amend the provisionsin Section 121.358(a) so that turbine powered airplanes may be equippedwith an airborne windshear warning and flight guidance system, or an approvedairborne windshear detection and avoidance system (predictive system),or an approved combination of these systems. Although no predictive, look-aheadsystems have been approved yet, the FAA does not want to preclude the useof predictive systems when such systems become available. <ITAG tagnum="84">Necessity for 30-Day Comment Period </ITAG>The FAA announced on July 10, 1989. [54 FR 28978] its intention to holda public meeting on August 16 and 17, 1989, to discuss possible changesto existing requirements for the installation of collision avoidance equipment(TCAS II) and windshear flight guidance equipment. The TCAS II equipmentis to be installed in the same aircraft that are covered by the windshearwarning and flight guidance equipment rules which are the subject of thisnotice. Uniform attainment of the TCAS II phased retrofit schedule mandatedby Public Law 100-223 coupled with the phased retrofit schedule for windshearequipment under Section 121.358 of the Federal Aviation Regulations appearsto be difficult at this time, as noted in the 1989 Office of TechnologyAssessment Report entitled <T3>Safer Skies with TCAS,</T3> and affirmed by a number of witnesses atthe hearings of the House Aviation Subcommittee on May 4, 1989, regardingH.R. 2151. If statutory changes are enacted and signed into law makingit possible for the FAA to modify the TCAS II installation schedules, itis in the public interest to make the installation schedule for the windshearwarning and flight guidance equipment compatible with the modified TCASII installation schedule; doing so will eliminate the need for two separateout-of-service retrofit periods for each aircraft. Those schedule changes,if they are to provide the relief intended, must be made as soon as possible,because of the complexity of the TCAS II installation requirements andthe urgent need for modification of that schedule. The changes proposedherein for the airborne windshear equipment installation requirements mustbe considered simultaneously with the changes in TCAS II installation schedulesin order to be able to assess the range of costs, benefits, and schedulingimplications of the various installation schedule options. The FAA is mailing a copy of this NPRM and the ATA petition, for rulemakingto all persons who have placed their names on the Department of Transportation'sPart 121 NPRM mailing list. In addition, the FAA is making the NPRM andthe ATA petition, including the data in the attachment to the petition,available to all groups it could identify as having an interest in theseissues, and has asked that these groups make this information availableto their members. <ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Summary </ITAG>The FAA has considered the economic impact of amending the airborne low-altitudewindshear equipment requirements (windshear rules) in response to certainissues raised by the ATA in its June 1, 1989, petition. The ATA petitioncontains an economic analysis, which maintains that the requirement forwindshear flight guidance does not pass the most elemental cost/benefitanalysis. Cost The petition indicates that industry sources agrees with the FAA's estimateof $372.2 million, in 1987 dollars, as the cost of equipping all affectedairplanes with on board windshear warning and escape flight guidance systemsover a 15 year period. The ATA claims however, that training and maintenanceduring the same 15 year period would drive total costs to over $800 million.The petition claims that the latest research conducted by the airlinesas they begin to comply with the rule indicates that the cost of windshearflight guidance, most likely, has been underestimated. ATA states thatairlines and airframe manufacturers are discovering that the recertificationof older airplanes after retrofitting windshear flight guidance is moredifficult than expected when the FAA developed its cost analysis for thewindshear final rule. The problems with recertification are twofold. First,there is concern regarding the feasibility of maintaining Category II andCategory III certification (lower visibility approaches) of some olderairplanes because the flight instrumentation systems may not be compatiblewith the windshear flight guidance systems. Second, obtaining certificationof the retrofitted flight guidance systems themselves is more difficultthan expected. According to the petition, the industry estimates the incremental costof adding windshear flight guidance along with the basic windshear alertequipment for all airplanes to be $183.4 million, in 1987 dollars, overthe 15 year period. ATA does not show how it arrived at these costs nordoes it estimate the number of airplanes that may need recertificationof the affected associated systems. The FAA realizes that retrofitting windshear escape flight guidance systemsinto older airplanes is more expensive than either retrofitting these systemsinto airplanes with digital flight instrumentation systems (digital airplanes)or manufacturing new airplanes with factory installed windshear flightguidance systems. This was shown in the regulatory evaluation of the finalwindshear rule. The FAA cannot verify the revised costs presented by thepetition because ATA does not present sufficient details showing how thecosts were derived. ATA does not quantify these costs nor does it estimatethe number of airplanes that may need recertification of the affected associatedsystems. Moreover, ATA does not attempt to quantify the marginal costsof retrofitting windshear flight guidance systems into older airplanes,although it seeks relief from the requirement to retrofit only these systems.The agency does not have sufficient data at this time to quantify ATA'scosts.  However, based on the information presented by ATA, the FAA acknowledgesthat certain certificate holders may incur substantial recertificationcosts. Therefore, the FAA requests additional information regarding training,maintenance, and recertification costs. Benefits The ATA petition points out that FAA estimated $451.6 million in benefitsover 15 years, assuming that all of the requirements of the rule wouldeliminate windshear accidents. These benefits were predicated on an accidentrate of 1.13 per year (17 windshear accidents occurred during the 15 yearspreceding the analysis). FAA notes that, in its regulatory evaluation ofthe windshear final rule, it predicated its projection of potential avoidableaccidents on the basis of accidents per operation. The petition submitsthat, since the 1983 Academy of Sciences Study and the subsequent voluntaryimplementation of windshear training by 80 percent of certificate holdersaffected by the windshear rules, the accident rate has dropped dramatically.In fact, no accidents have occurred in 42 months, or four times longerthan the previous average. Thus, in the last 6 years, since the academystudy, the accident rate has fallen to 0.5 accidents per year. Scalingthe benefits of the rule accordingly, reduces the 15 year benefits to $199.2million. The petition maintains that pilot reports attribute the abovereduction in accidents to the avoidance of windshear made possible by heightenedawareness of clues to its existence and their significance, rather thanto the use of recovery techniques. While the FAA does not dispute ATA's assertion that no windshear accidentshave occurred in the 42-month period cited in the petition or that pilottraining in handling windshear conditions has significantly affected thewindshear accident rate, it is unwilling to accept that the reduction inaccidents over the 42-month period can be attributed solely to pilot training.Other factors, such as controller awareness and increased forecasting capabilitiesalso could have played a role in the reduction of such accidents. Thesecontinued efforts should improve safety. For example, 1985 was the aviationindustry's safest year. The exact cause for this has never been pinpointednor has the industry been able to repeat that year's safety record. Commentersshould address whether the FAA should give the 42-month period the overwhelmingweight in estimating benefits that was given to it in the ATA petition.Is a longer period necessary to accurately ascertain the impact of pilottraining, or any other factor, on improved safety? The petition attempts to isolate the incremental benefit of windshear flightguidance by referring to the Windshear Training Aid. The Windshear TrainingAid compares ``optimum'' flight guidance, i.e., guidance methods havingfull knowledge of the wind field and optimized for the conditions, againstalerting plus flight guidance and alerting plus training techniques. Inthis study optimum flight guidance is given a value of 100 percent; alertingplus flight guidance is given a value of 97 percent; and alerting plustrained techniques is given a value of 94 percent. Based on the 3 percentdifference in effectiveness between alerting plus flight guidance on theone hand, and alerting plus trained techniques on the other, the petitionallocates $5.8 million over the 15 year period as the benefit attributableto flight guidance alone. According to ATA, the benefits of retrofitting older airplanes with windshearflight guidance over the 15 year period, do not justify the cost of suchretrofitting. ATA points out that the FAA, in the preamble to the finalwindshear rules, acknowledged that the accident prevention potential attributedto these rules was uncertain. ATA asserts that this analysis does not supportthe requirement for escape flight guidance.The FAA acknowledges the study ATA used as the basis for its analysis,but does not believe that the study's findings are conclusive enough tosignificantly influence this rulemaking action. For example, the effectivenessvalues may not have been allocated to each of the different combinationsof windshear systems on a strictly scientific basis. ATA's petition also claims that safety may be decreased because flightguidance on older airplanes is dependent on the issuance of a windshearwarning. As the FAA understands ATA's contention, pilots who are trainedto avoid windshear conditions may fail to initiate early avoidance proceduresand instead wait for the warning and flight guidance. The FAA does notdeny that certain pilots may rely on warning dependent flight guidanceto help them recover from a windshear encounter instead of initiating earlyavoidance techniques; however, the FAA does not have sufficient informationto determine whether this practice would result in decreased safety. Conclusion ATA concludes by stating that it strongly believes that too little credithas been given to the increased understanding of the windshear phenomenonand the ensuing training improvements that have resulted in reduced windshearrelated accidents. ATA cites various encounters with windshear conditionsby pilots, without windshear devices, and how they successfully dealt withthese conditions using the techniques recommended in the Windshear TrainingAid. Further, ATA notes the absence of windshear related accidents duringthe past 3 years and asserts that this proves that the bulk of the benefitsshould be attributed to training rather than the devices required by theregulation, particularly the requirement to equip the older airplanes inthe fleet with warning dependent escape flight guidance systems. The petitionmaintains that if FAA grants the relief sought, no reduction in safetywould result. It reiterates that the rules have raised concerns that awarning dependent escape flight guidance system may be less safe than apilot executed escape maneuver initiated before the issuance of a warning.While the FAA cannot fully agree with all of the assertions in ATA's petition,it concedes that the petition raises a number of issues that merit furtherconsideration. Based on data presented in the petition, the FAA realizesthat certain certificate holders may incur recertification costs that werenot taken into account in the regulatory evaluation of the final windshearrules. A degree of uncertainty still exists regarding the effect of retrofittingwindshear flight guidance into certain older airplanes. Introducing flightguidance into these airplanes may result in time consuming and expensiverecertification of these older airplanes. Because ATA presented insufficientdata regarding these costs, the FAA cannot quantify them at this time.Nevertheless, these costs may adversely affect the cost efficiency of retrofittingwindshear flight guidance into older airplanes. Therefore, this issue shouldbe reconsidered. The FAA disagrees with the ATA assertion that no safety benefits are providedby windshear flight guidance on older airplanes and recognizes that, ifthe relief sought is granted, the full safety benefits of windshear systemsestimated in the regulatory evaluation of the final windshear rules maynot be realized. The FAA has not quantified the extent by which these benefitswould be reduced, nor has the agency quantified the extent, if any, towhich safety benefits will accrue by eliminating the possibility of toomuch pilot reliance on warning-dependent windshear flight guidance. Inaddition, the FAA needs to closely study ATA's attempt to isolate the incrementalbenefits of retrofitting windshear escape flight guidance systems intoolder airplanes. Therefore, the FAA seeks comments from the public regardingthese issues to help determine the extent to which the benefits obtainedfrom windshear systems would be reduced if the requested relief is granted.The FAA notes that these reduced benefits may be further reduced by thefact that the affected airplanes are the segment of the fleet expectedto be most rapidly retired because of age. In light of the above discussion, the FAA is considering the issues raisedby the petition; therefore, it requests comments on this regulatory evaluationand on the consequences of granting the relief requested by ATA. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Determination </ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress inorder to ensure, among other things, that small entities are not disproportionatelyaffected by Government regulations. The RFA requires a regulatory flexibilityanalysis if a rule has a significant economic impact, either detrimentalor beneficial, on a substantial number of small business entities. FAAOrder 2100.14A, <T3>Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance,</T3> establishes thresholdcost values and small entity size standards for complying with RFA reviewrequirements in FAA rulemaking actions. The small entities that would beaffected by the proposed rule amendments are part 121 certificate holdersthat own nine or fewer aircraft, which is the size threshold for smallaircraft operators. The cost thresholds are $94,500 for operators of scheduledservices with entire fleets having a seating capacity of over 60; $54,000for other scheduled operators; and $3,700 for unscheduled operators.\3\<NOTE/> A substantial number of small entities means a number whichis not less than eleven and which is more than one-third of the small entitiessubject to the proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Thresholds appearing in the order have been inflated from1986 to 1989 dollars using the Consumer Price Index appearing in ``FAAAviation Forecasts, Fiscal Years 1989-2000 (FAA-APO-89-1) March 1989. The FAA has determined that granting ATA's petition requesting the eliminationfrom the windshear regulations the requirement that windshear escape flightguidance systems be retrofitted into certain older airplanes may have asignificant beneficial economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. According to FAA data for the period ending December 1, 1987, 51 certificateholder subject to part 121 operated nine or fewer aircraft. Twenty-sevenof these certificate holders conducted scheduled service and the remaining24 engaged in unscheduled operations. These 51 certificate holders aresmall entities that will be affected by the proposed rule changes. Although the FAA does not have sufficient information to accurately estimatethe level of the economic impact on these small operators, it has determinedthat the impact may be significant by using data in the regulatory evaluationof windshear final rules. The impact of relieving small certificate holdersfrom the requirement that windshear escape flight guidance systems be retrofittedon certain older airplanes should exceed the $3,700 cost threshold fornonscheduled part 121 certificate holders. While FAA does not have datareadily available indicating how many of the affected aircraft each ofthese small entities has in its fleet, FAA feels secure in assuming thatmore than one-third of such small certificate holders have at least oneof the affected aircraft in their fleet. Thus, a substantial number ofnonscheduled part 121 certificate holders are expected to incur a significantbeneficial economic impact as a result of the proposed amendments to thewindshear regulations. On the basis of this finding a full regulatory flexibilityanalysis is attached as appendix A to the full regulatory evaluation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Trade Impact Assessment </ITAG>The proposed rule amendments will have little or no impact on trade byeither U.S. firms doing business in foreign countries or foreign firmsdoing business in the United States. The proposed rules will apply onlyto part 121 certificate holders some of which compete internationally forpassenger and cargo revenues. Granting the relief requested by ATA's petitionwill permit the affected certificate holders to operate aircraft equippedessentially the same as those of international air carriers, most of whosecountries do not require them to install windshear equipment. In any event,the amount of relief that would be granted to these carriers is not expectedto be sufficient enough to noticeably impact international trade. Therefore,the proposed amendment will not cause a competitive fare disadvantage forU.S. carriers in international operations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications </ITAG>Changes to the regulations proposed by this notice, if enacted, would nothave a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship betweenthe States, on the relationship between the national Government and theStates, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among thevarious levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order12612, it is determined that these proposed changes would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>For the reasons discussed above, the FAA has determined that this proposedamendment is not major under Executive Order 12291 and that it is significantunder the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034, February 26. 1979). Also for the reasons discussed above,it has been determined that the proposed amendment would have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 121 </ITAG>Air carriers, Air transportation, Aviation safety, Safety, Transportation,Windshear. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Rule </ITAG>Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend Part121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 121) as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 121_CERTIFICATION AND OPERATIONS; DOMESTIC, FLAG, AND SUPPLEMENTALAIR CARRIERS AND COMMERCIAL OPERATORS OF LARGE AIRCRAFT </ITAG>1.
