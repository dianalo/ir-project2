The variations of the components of natural gas, andthe vast differences in the heating value of different streams of gas,make the proper sampling of the product an operation that can no longerbe left to chance. Gas is a fragile product and without proper care,can be difficult to handle effectively. It is no longer practical tosend just anyone to a location to &quot;grab a sample&quot;. It behooves us tosend trained personnel to collect gas samples that are representativeof the gas flowing in the pipeline. This paper discusses the methodsemployed in the sampling operation, and the factors that have to be takenin consideration when sampling.</TEXT></DOC>
