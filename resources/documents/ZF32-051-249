(Washington D.C.'s increasing Japan bashing)(Column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Robinson, Brian.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Once again Washington DC is creating a sense of economic urgencyby leaning on its proven tactic of bashing Japan's tradepractices.andP;  Like Godzilla in the movie, Washington seems to becreating a Japanese menace that will waddle threateningly upon theAmerican shoreline following a time of tranquility, only to bebeaten by the valiant efforts of a few brave people.andP;  Those peoplehave been stepping forward.andP;  House Minority Leader RichardGephardt plans to introduce legislation to renew the Super 301clause that has been used in the past as a prime tool for bashingJapan, and Sen Lloyd Bentsen has asked the General AccountingOffice to investigate claims that Japan is 'stealing' Americantechnology.andP;  It is likely that Japan is no more or less guiltythan the US or Economic Community have been in their tradepractices.andP;  Instead, American law-makers should question whetherthe old trade-policy tools are still relevant today.andP;  For example,the most recent semiconductor pact between the US and Japancontains a foreign manufacturers' share of 20 percent of Japan'schip market by the end of 1992.andP;  There is little chance thistarget will be reached, and manufacturers in both countries knowthis, but Congress could use the shortfall as another example ofJapanese duplicity if the mistrust between the two countriesintensifies.andP;  The US and Japan are both dependent on each other'seconomies.andP;  Perhaps it is time for a little more understanding.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     JapanJapanese CompetitionUnited StatesInternational TradeNational GovernmentGovernment Regulation.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
