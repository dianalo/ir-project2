Nestle's 2.55 billion-pound offer edges out rival bidder JacobsSuchard AG, a Swiss chocolate and coffee concern, to create theworld's second-largest confectioner behind Mars Inc.   The bid for Rowntree, maker of the Kit Kat candy bar, is thelargest offer for a British company by a foreign concern.   Nestle will pay 10.75 pounds a share, or $19.03, up from itsinitial bid of 2.1 billion pounds, or 890 pence a share. Theconfectioner increased its stake in Rowntree to 22 percent Thursdayfrom a previous 15.8 percent.   Suchard, which holds a 29.9 percent stake in Rowntree, hadoffered 2.32 billion pounds, or 950 pence a share.   Tim Potter, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. inLondon, noted that Nestle's bid not only is 13 percent higher thanSuchard's offer, but Nestle ``got the board along with theagreement, which is crucial in this takeover battle. That isprobably enough to win Rowntree.''   Suchard declined to comment on its plans, but Walter Anderau,the company's vice president for corporate affairs, said, ``We arein no rush.'' But he said Suchard is ``still convinced thatRowntree would be the ideal partner for us.''   Analysts predict Suchard, which will drop from second to thirdplace among worldwide confectioners, is likely to sell out to itsrival. At the current buyout price, Suchard's profit would amountto about 205 million pounds, Potter said.   The battle for Rowntree began April 13 when Zurich-basedSuchard, maker of the triangular Toblerone chocolate bar, snappedup nearly 15 percent of Rowntree's shares in a ``dawn raid.'' Thatmove prompted Nestle to enter the fray with an initial offer onApril 26. Suchard countered with its bid a month later.   In trading on the London Stock Exchange, Rowntree closed up 37pence a share at 10.76 pounds a share.   Nestle said it assured Rowntree that the confectioner's Yorkheadquarters will remain the center of the company's activities inBritain and that the office also will serve as headquarters ofNestle's international chocolate and confectionery ``strategy.''   In addition, Rowntree Chairman Kenneth Dixon will be retained asan executive member of the Nestle general management committee.   The assurances were an apparent attempt to fend off publiccriticism about the takeover.   Rowntree's Dixon said, ``We believe that the price now offeredis fair and shareholders and employees should both gain from theagreement which has been reached.''   The competing bids by the two Swiss companies sparked acontroversy in Britain, where critics objected to the acquisitionof the 263-year-old British company by a foreign concern and fearedjob losses in York, where Rowntree employs 5,300 of its 30,000workers.   The government's decision not to intervene in the takeover bidssparked protests and divided members of Prime Minister MargaretThatcher's Conservative Party.   ``This is a sad but inevitable result of the government'srefusal to defend British industry against foreign predators,''said Bryan Gould, an opposition Labor Party lawmaker.   Rowntree, which traces its origins back to a Quaker grocer'sshop in northeast England, had a pre-tax profit of 112 millionpounds on sales of 1.43 billion pounds in 1987.   Nestle, based in Vevey, Switzerland, had net profit of 1.8billion Swiss francs, or about $1.2 billion, on sales of 35.2billion Swiss francs, or $24 billion last year.   Helmut Maucher, Nestle's managing director, said, ``We lookforward to building on the strengths of the two companies andcreating a prosperous future for the combined group.''   The previous largest foreign bid for a British company wasAustralia-based Elders IXL's 1986 purchase of the Courage brewingbusiness from Hanson PLC for 1.4 billion pounds, or $2.5 billion,according to Mergers and Acquisitions magazine.</TEXT></DOC>
