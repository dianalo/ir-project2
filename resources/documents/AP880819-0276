Davis, the primary owner of the $77 million bank in Denver's17th Street financial district, made the contribution to Metro'scapital just after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. held anauction for the bank, in which the FDIC tried to find a buyer forthe bank.   The infusion of capital brings the bank's capital-to-assetsratio to 7 percent, the minimum required by regulations, andboosted Davis' contributions to Metro to $32 million, a spokesmansaid.   Davis, who divides his time between Los Angeles and Denver, hasbailed the bank out of problems before.   The bank has been hit hard by energy, real estate and pennystock-related loans. It was on the brink of insolvency last monthafter the Colorado Supreme Court refused to strike a $940,000judgment against the bank in a case involving a defunct penny stockbrokerage, regulators said.   On March 31, Metro's capital had fallen to 1.64 percent ofassets, after the bank lost $610,000 during the first three monthsof the year. It lost $12.9 million in 1987, according to SheshunoffInformation Services Inc.   Problem loans totaled $11.3 million, or more than 20 percent ofthe bank's total loan portfolio, officials said.   The bank's problems have forced officials to reduce its size bymore than 50 percent since 1984, when it had $181 million in assets.</TEXT></DOC>
