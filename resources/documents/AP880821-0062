More than 3,000 were injured in the quake, which seismologistscalled the deadliest to strike the Himalayan region since 1950.   Indian officials said at least 125 people were killed and 2,000injured in the eastern state of Bihar. Government television putthe number of dead at more than 300.   State-run Radio Nepal said at least 281 people were killed intowns near the border, and Nepalese officials said more than 1,000were injured.   The quake also jolted parts of northern Bangladesh and thecapital of Dhaka, but there were no reports of casualties or damage.   The Seismological Observatory in New Delhi said the quakeoccurred at 4:40 a.m. and measured 6.5 on the Richter scale. Thequake lasted for about one minute and aftershocks continued forabout an hour, observatory director H.N. Srivastava said.   Srivastava said the temblor was centered about 40 to 50 milesnortheast of Darbhanga, a town of about 800,000 in Bihar. Thelocation puts the epicenter almost on the India-Nepal border.   Officials said most of the deaths occurred in Darbhanga, Mungerand Madhubani districts. More than 25,000 houses in those areaswere destroyed, they said.   V.K. Sharma, a deputy secretary in the Bihar government,predicted the death toll would rise because many people wereseriously injured.   Landslides knocked out communication links on both sides of theborder, preventing officials from obtaining information aboutcasualties or damage from the remote, hardest hit areas.   ``The tolls have come in only from urban areas,'' Sharma said ina telephone interview from Patna, the Bihar capital.   The monsoon rains, which hit the subcontinent in late June andusually continue through September, also were hampering rescueoperations. More than 50 villages were flooded after the quakeshifted embankments.   In Nepal, Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya, a Foreign Ministryofficial, said at least 500 people were injured and thousands ofhouses collapsed from the quake's impact. But other officials saidlater Sunday that more than 1,000 were hurt.   ``Most of (the victims were) buried alive under collapsedhouses,'' said Indra Shrestha, a social worker involved in therescue operations at Dharan Bazar, a township of about 100,000people about 18 miles from the Indian border.   In the ancient township of Bhaktapur, about 11 miles south ofKatmandu, Mayor Assa Kazi Basakala surveyed the damage.   ``The Germans came and helped restore most of this town to itsoriginal, traditional splendor'' in 1960, he said. ``I don't knowhow we'll rebuild now.''   Officials in both countries were rushing medical teams, clothesand other relief material to the disaster aras. Indian PrimeMinister Rajiv Gandhi planned to visit the region Monday to surveythe damage.   Most of the victims were asleep in their beds when the quakestruck. Witnesses said windows and doors rattled, buildings crackedand people ran screaming from their homes.   ``My bed rattled, then it began swinging,'' said R.N. Rudra, aresident of Patna. ``My dogs began barking and I ran out of thehouse.''   The quake also was felt in the heavily populated states of UttarPradesh, West Bengal and Orissa, United News of India said. Reportsof injuries came from the Darjeeling district of West Bengal, thenews agency said, but no deaths were reported.   The Press Trust of India news agency said 17 children werekilled in Darbhanga town, which is about 560 miles southeast of NewDelhi, when a school hostel caved in.   In the neighboring Madhubani district, a river jumped its banksafter the quake shifted embankments and flooded nearly 50 villages,the United News of India said.   Officials said at least 45 people died in the district, but itwas not known whether the deaths were due to floods or collapsinghouses.   The Bhootahi Balan River continued to rise more than 12 hoursafter the quake, and the army was alerted to the possibility thattroops might be sent to help rescue operations, the officials said.   The Richter scale measures the energy released by an earthquakeas gauged by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quakeof magnitude 6 is capable of causing severe damage.   The worst quake on record in the Indian subcontinent occurred in1935, when at least 30,000 people were killed in Quetta, India, inwhat is now Pakistan. In 1950, an estimated 1,530 were killed inthe Himalayan foothills of India's Assam state.   Nepal's deadliest earthquake occurred in 1934. More than 10,700people died.</TEXT></DOC>
