Meanwhile, two Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation thatwould require candidates who are eligible to receive public fundsin the general election campaign to agree in writing to participatein at least four 90-minute debates. The vice presidential nomineeswould be required to engage in at least one debate.   ``If presidential candidates are going to continue to take $100million from taxpayers to run their campaigns, then there ought tobe some assurance that they will stand up on stage, face theiropponent and engage in a true discussion of the issues,'' said Rep.Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., who introduced the legislation with Sen.Bob Graham, D-Fla.   Under the proposal, the debates would be sponsored bynon-partisan organizations and held in September and October. Atleast 30 minutes of each 90-minute debate would be devoted toquestions and answers or candidate-to-candidate exchanges.   The Federal Election Commission would determine whethercandidates are responsible for failing to comply.   Taxpayer contributions, which come from checking a $1contribution box on tax returns, have been declining because,according to Markey, ``each year fewer and fewer think they'regetting their dollar's worth.''   The percentage of taxpayers contributing to the PresidentialElection Campaign Fund has dropped steadily from 28.7 percent in1981 to 21 percent in 1988, according to the ongressional ResearchService.   Once overflowing, the campaign fund is falling victim toinflation as well as a dropoff in income.   FEC spokesman Fred Eiland said the peak year was $41 millionearmarked on returns filed in 1981. On returns filed last year,only $33 million was earmarked for the election fund.   The fund is the source for the matching contributions the FECallocates to candidates for the major party nominations as well asthe lump sum payments made to the nominees for the generalelections campaign.   In 1988, Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakisreceived federal checks for $46.1 million each for their fallcampaigns. In addition, each party received $9.2 million.   The FEC also paid out a total of $66.7 million in matchingfunds. The commission matches up to $250 in individualcontributions to qualified presidential candidates during theprimary campaign.   Republican Pat Robertson received $10.1 million in matchingfunds, the largest amount of any presidential candidate. Dukakiswas second with $9 million and Bush third with $8.4 million.   The fund paid out a total of $177 million in 1988. The firstyear it operated was 1976 when $70 million was distributed tocandidates.   Eiland said the fund is expected to have enough money to coverthe 1992 election assuming President Bush has no serious oppositionfor the GOP nomination.</TEXT></DOC>
