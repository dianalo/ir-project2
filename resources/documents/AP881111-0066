(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Citing the biblical wisdom that people reapwhat they sow, a judge ordered Jim and Tammy Bakker and a former topaide to repay $7.7 million to PTL for taking undeserved profits fromthe TV ministry.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds said he determined that theBakkers and former PTL vice president David Taggart were overpaidduring their last four years at the ministry.   ``In conforming with the religious overture of this case, thiscourt observes that James Bakker either overlooked or ignored partsof the Bible, including 1 Timothy 6:10 ... `For the love of money isthe root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they haveerred from the faith and pierced themselves through with manysorrows,''' Reynolds said in his order, filed Thursday.   Reynolds said Galatians 6:7 should also be applied to the PTLcase: ```Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a mansoweth, that shall he also reap.'''   PTL, now under administration of the bankruptcy court, sued theBakkers and Taggart on Feb. 1 for $52 million. The ministry allegedthey grossly mismanaged the ministry by taking huge sums forpersonal use between 1984 and 1987 while PTL couldn't pay its bills.   During the trial, which ended Oct. 20, PTL dropped its claim toall but $7.7 million. Reynolds's judgment is the first time anycourt has ruled that Bakker or other PTL leaders used PTL donors'money improperly.   In the order, Reynolds said Jim Bakker, who founded PTL and leftin March 1987 after admitting to a tryst with former churchsecretary Jessica Hahn, must pay PTL $4.9 million. Tammy Bakker, hiswife and former co-host of the ``PTL Club'' television show, mustrepay $677,397, and Taggart must repay $1 million.   In addition, Reynolds ordered, Bakker and Taggart jointly mustrepay PTL another $1 million. Taggart was fired in April 1987 byJerry Falwell, who took over PTL from Bakker.   PTL attorney R. Bradford Leggett of Winston-Salem, N.C., said,``I think the judge's opinion made a clear suggestion that whenpeople contribute to support a ministry, there is a trust involvedthat must be dealt with in good faith.''   Reynolds, in his 50-page order, said PTL's expenditures underBakker were ``unbelievable'' and a ``waste of PTL's money.'' He alsoaccused the administrators of ``gross mismanagement'' and ``totaldisregard for reality.''   Reynolds said it appeared the PTL board of directors was neverinformed that the ministry and Christian theme park near Fort Millwas in ``any kind of precarious financial position.''   The judge rejected Bakker's attempts during the trial to justifythe $6.6 million in salary and bonuses he and his wife collectedbetween 1984 and 1987.   ``We plan to appeal,'' said Ryan Hovis, the Bakkers' Rock Hillattorney. Hovis said Bakker could not repay the ministry because``he doesn't have anything.''   A secretary at the Bakkers' new organization, Jim and TammyMinistries in Pineville, N.C., said Bakker would not comment untilhe reads the order.   Taggart's attorney, Ben Cotten of Washington, D.C., did notreturn telephone calls seeking comment.   Last month, Bakker and several former PTL associates werenotified they are targets of an investigation by a federal grandjury in Charlotte, N.C., which focuses on possible mail and wirefraud, conspiracy and criminal tax violations.   Leggett said that although the Bakkers and Taggart have the rightto appeal Reynolds' judgment to U.S. District Court, PTL intends tobegin trying to collect from them.   Reynolds is scheduled to choose a buyer for PTL's assets onWednesday from four bids ranging from $113 million to $120 million.</TEXT></DOC>
