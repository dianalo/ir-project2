Edward Kwalwasser, executive vice president at theexchange, told the Senate Securities Subcommittee that&quot;non-material documentation problems&quot; were noticed byexaminers in April but we &quot;didn't think they were serious.&quot;The Big Board then wrote to Salomon management explaining theproblems and asked how the firm would fix them, Mr.Kwalwasser said. He wouldn't say whether the problems focusedon government securities.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Kwalwasser said the Big Board was &quot;surprised&quot; bySalomon's August announcement of wrongdoing, and now isplanning to review its examination program to determinewhether the examiners are looking at the things they should.   The disclosure raises serious questions about whether theregulatory oversight program is sufficient to catch misdeedsat Wall Street firms.   Mr. Kwalwasser said the Big Board's reviews don't includebids from Treasury auctions because those are out of theexchange's purview. He added that a firm such as Salomon isinvolved in 8,000 securities trades a day, making it eventougher to find false bids.   Separately, representatives of S.G. Warburg Group PLC; itsU.S. affiliate, S.G. Warburg andamp; Co., and a money-managementaffiliate, Mercury Asset Management Co., met with Treasuryofficials to explain their failure to inform the agency offalse bids placed by Salomon in February.   Salomon has said that it placed a false bid in the name ofWarburg. But the primary dealer also placed a bid on its own.When the New York Federal Reserve Bank asked Salomon'sgovernment-bond trading desk chief, Paul Mozer, he said thebid was actually from Mercury. But Mercury hadn't placed anybid. The Treasury wrote to the firms to inform them aboutbidding rules, but in Mercury's reply, Charles Jackson,senior director, didn't inform the agency that it hadn'tplaced the bid. He also didn't tell the Treasury that Mr.Mozer had called to ask him not to tell the Treasury aboutthe &quot;error&quot; Salomon had made in bidding.   At yesterday's meeting, Warburg and its affiliates arguedthat the Treasury's letter was a policy statement, not arequest for information, an individual familiar with thediscussion said. Moreover, Mercury officials got a call fromSalomon, a massive market player, explaining that it had madea mistake and that the mistake had been corrected when thesecurities were given to the right customer. So the firmssaid it wasn't unreasonable for Mercury not to inform theTreasury, the individual said.   Donald Kittell, chief administrative officer of S.G.Warburg andamp; Co., said the meeting, which lasted for more thanan hour, was &quot;open and constructive&quot; and that his firm isconfident it will be cleared of any misconduct. Mr. Jacksondidn't attend the session, but will attend a meeting todaybetween Warburg and Securities and Exchange Commissionofficials. Treasury officials declined to comment onyesterday's meeting.   In his testimony before the Senate yesterday, Mr.Kwalwasser said that two &quot;major firms lost millions throughthe squeeze&quot; created by Salomon and its customers in themarket for May two-year notes. He said that firms firedtraders over the incident, but wouldn't identify either thefirms or the individuals.   His immediate concern is the examination process. He saidhe is worried that Mr. Mozer apparently was able to easilysuppress customer confirmation tickets at Salomon, in turnapparently creating false books and records at the firm. &quot;Wehave to believe that the books and records are accurate,&quot; Mr.Kwalwasser said. &quot;If the books and records are able to bechanged, it really sets back our examination program a lot.&quot;   The New York exchange fined Salomon $1.3 million earlierthis year for violations stemming from stock trading in 1987.   In another area, the chairman and chief executive officerof the Federal National Mortgage Association, James Johnson,acknowledged that there long has been &quot;a certain amount ofpuffery and hype&quot; in offers made by securities firms for thedebt of the government-sponsored agency. But Mr. Johnsonemphasized that it wasn't until Salomon disclosed thepractice in August that Fannie Mae had hard evidence thatdealers had gone &quot;clearly beyond the gray area&quot; by submittingfalse written reports to the firm.   While many players in the market have long consideredoverbidding as a customary procedure, SEC Chairman RichardBreeden told a Senate subcommittee Wednesday that a&quot;distressingly large&quot; number of firms placed false orderswith Fannie Mae and similar agencies.   Agencies such as Fannie Mae provide crucial financing forhousing by selling debt through Wall Street firms, using thatmoney to buy mortgages and repackaging those mortgages intosecurities that are sold to investors. The firms that buy theoriginal debt apparently routinely hype their customer ordersto get a bigger allocation from the agency.   Earlier this week, Fannie Mae said it was changing the wayit sells its debt because of inflated customer orders andfalse written confirmations. Several other agencies have saidthey are reviewing their sales procedures.   ---   John Connor contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
