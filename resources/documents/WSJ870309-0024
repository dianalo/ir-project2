Cash-strapped Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma are flooding the municipal-bond market with debt. But their bonds are meeting investor resistance, because of concern about the crippling effects of depressed oil prices.    &quot;Some of our salesmen have accounts with the policy: no Texas, no Louisiana,&quot; says Thomas Gamello, research analyst with Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben Inc., a Cleveland-based brokerage firm.    Although oil is now trading at about $18 a barrel, compared with a low of $7 last July, it's still far below the $30 a barrel producers were getting in November 1985. The price roller coaster has wreaked havoc on states and municipalities accustomed to hefty tax revenues generated by the oil and gas industry.    But energy analysts and those who track regional economic trends are confident the oil-producing states will eventually rise again. They believe oil-patch bonds can be attractive for patient, adventurous investors who are able to see past -- and wait out -- the current problems.    Typically, these bonds offer investors a yield incentive of one-tenth to one-third of a percentage point over similar bonds from non-oil states. Although that's considered a significant spread in the bond market, it doesn't provide much incentive for someone investing only a few thousand dollars. The real payoff from taking a chance on down-at-the-heels regions would come if their economies improved, and the market price of the bonds rose.    Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma aren't the only states hurt by the oil-price drop, but they are the ones hit hardest -- and the ones deluging the market with debt. Indeed, almost a quarter of the $13 billion of tax-exempt securities sold this year have come from these three states.    For investors, the big worries are the risk of a default, which might wipe out their investment, and the risk of a ratings downgrading, which would mean a loss if they sold their bonds before maturity.    Investment analysts and others generally agree that the danger of default is minimal. &quot;States have so many resources available that default isn't a real concern,&quot; says Steven Hueglin, who is in charge of research at Gabriele, Hueglin andamp; Cashman Inc. The New York brokerage firm is recommending a recent $1.15 billion issue of Louisiana general obligation bonds, which has the lowest rating of any state debt, as &quot;a very attractive buy.&quot;    Concern about possible downgradings is another matter, analysts say. Last year, 81% of the 75 ratings changes made by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. on oil-patch debt were downgradings. Nationally, only 45% of the changes were downgradings.    In the market, the price of downgraded bonds is reduced so that they offer about one-quarter of a percentage point more in yield. It isn't unusual for a long-term bond downgraded one notch (to A from AA, for example) to drop $10 to $20 in value for each $1,000 face amount.    Insured bonds offer protection against default and tend to fluctuate less in price than uninsured bonds. But they also tend to offer a lower yield and add their own element of risk if the insurance firm backing the bonds is itself downgraded.    Moreover, bond prices can fall merely in anticipation of downgradings. And with Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, many analysts expect more bad news before the turnaround. These states &quot;have done as much as they can do on cutting expenditures, and haven't done a bad job,&quot; says William Oliver, senior municipal analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. But retail sales and property taxes, particularly in Texas, are likely to drop 5% to 10% in coming months, he says.    Still, for people who aren't forced to sell, a downgrading may make no difference: As long as the issuer doesn't default, investors receive the yield promised when they purchased the securities, and they get back their principal at maturity.    Meanwhile, Richard Ciccarone, senior municipal analyst with American Portfolio Advisory Service Inc., a unit of Van Kampen Merritt Inc. of Chicago, adds a bit of historical perspective. Pointing to the thriving economy of New England, he notes that a decade ago it &quot;was perceived to be in as bad a position as the Southwest is in now.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
