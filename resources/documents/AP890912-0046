Police said two people were killed and 17 wounded in theovernight duel, which escalated at 3:30 a.m. as the Princess-Handentered Lebanese territorial waters about 20 miles north of Beirut.   By police count, the six-month confrontation between Gen. MichelAoun's mainly Christian troops and the Syrian army has claimed thelives of 847 people and left 2,528 wounded.   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations,said the Syrians opened up at the Princess-Hand usingradar-controlled 130mm howitzers deployed north of the Christianenclave.   The ship, he said, sailed ``very close'' to theChristian-controlled coast as shells exploded around it, but made itsafely to the port of Jounieh and dropped anchor at 4:30 a.m. Hesaid further details about the ship's nationality and agents werenot available.   However, the spokesman said the bales of newsprint were importedby three newspapers operating in Christian east Beirut. He did notelaborate.   East Beirut and the rest of the 310-square-mile Christian enclavenortheast of the capital has been besieged by the Syrians for morethat six months in retaliation for a blockade imposed by Aoun onports run by Syria's militia allies south of Beirut.   Syrian gunboats have intercepted several ships trying to defy theblockade, and several vessels have been hit by Syrian shellfire asthey approached Christian ports. Most such attacks have not beenreported.   The daily newspaper An-Nahar published a study released by thegovernment-run Maritime Transport Directorate which said 27 shipshave been affected by the Syrian blockade of Christian waters, whichhas killed 14 seamen and wounded five.   The study said five of the ships were set ablaze by Syrianshelling, six suffered direct shell hits, 11 were hit by shrapneland five were intercepted by Syrian gunboats and taken toSyrian-controlled ports.   Meanwhile, Lebanese newspapers predicted that a truce in theSyrian-Christian confrontation would result from a meeting by athree-man Arab mediation committee scheduled for Wednesday in SaudiArabia.   An-Nahar said Aoun has agreed to the idea forming a team tomonitor the import of weapons by the warring Lebanese factions, anissue which has been a sticking point.   The Syrians claim Iraq, their Arab arch rival, is providing Aounwith weapons and ammunitions by sea.   The 54-year-old Maronite Catholic general has repeatedly refusedproposals for the formation of a team of observers to monitor the28-mile Christian-controlled stretch of Lebanon's 130-mileMediterranean coast.   Aoun's reported acceptance of an observation team, which couldnot be officially verified, is expected to facilitate efforts of themediation committee, which comprises the foreign ministers of SaudiArabia, Morocco and Algeria.   The three chief diplomats, after Wednesday's meeting, are toreport to their leaders on the possibility of stabilizing thesituation in Lebanon.   Kind Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and AlgerianPresident Chadli Bendjedid were asked by a full-fledged Arab summitin May to find a settlement by November to Lebanon's 14-year-oldcivil war.   However, the mediation committee announced July 28 that itsefforts on Lebanon were deadlocked and blamed Syria for blocking itsmission.   Aoun and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of betrayingtheir 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 22-nation Arab League bysiding with Moslems against Christians in the civil war, which hastaken more than 150,000 lives.</TEXT></DOC>
