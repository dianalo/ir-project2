Among other things, NAECA requires DOE to consideramending the energy conservation standards for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers,and freezers; and to establish standards for small gas furnaces, and toconsider prescribing standards for television sets.The Department of Energy has determined that revised energy conservationstandards for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers would resultin significant conservation of energy and be economically justified. Therefore,the Department is today amending title 10, part 430 of the Code of FederalRegulations (part 430) to add new standards for this product. More stringentstandards, including the maximum technologically feasible level, were consideredby the Department, but rejected based upon consideration of the economicanalysis.For small gas furnaces, the Department has determined that standards wouldresult in a significant conservation of energy and be economically justified.Therefore, the Department is today amending part 430 to add standards forthis product which are the maximum allowable by law.For television sets, DOE has determined a new analysis is necessary andis not now making a determination on the need for standards on televisions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATES:</T2> This action amending andSection; 430.32(a), thestandards for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers, is effectiveas of January 1, 1993.This action amending andSection; 430.32(e), setting the standards for smallgas furnaces (input rate less than 45,000 Btu/hr), is effective as of January1, 1992.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES:</T2> A copy of the Technical Support Document may be readat the DOE Freedom of Information Reading Room, U.S. Department of Energy,Forrestal Building, Room 1E-190, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington,DC 20585, (202) 586-6020, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Mondaythrough Friday, except Federal holidays.

AuthorityPart B of title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Pub.L. 94-163, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA),Pub. L. 95-619, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA),Pub. L. 100-12, and the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendmentsof 1988 (NAECA 1988), Pub. L. 100-357,1<NOTE/> created the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Productsother than Automobiles. The consumer products subject to this program (oftenreferred to hereafter as ``covered products'') are: Refrigerators, refrigerator-freezersand freezers; dishwashers; clothes dryers; water heaters; central air conditionersand central air conditioning heat pumps; furnaces; direct heating equipment;television sets; kitchen ranges and ovens; clothes washers; room air conditioners;fluorescent lamp ballasts; and pool heaters; as well as any other consumerproduct classified by the Secretary of Energy. Section 322. To date, theSecretary has not so classified any additional products.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>1 Part B of title III of EPCA, as amended by NECPA, NAECA,and NAECA 1988, is referred to in this notice as the ``Act.'' Part B oftitle III is codified at 42 U.S.C. 6291 <T3>et seq.</T3> Part B of title III of EPCA, as amended by NECPA only,is referred to in this notice as NECPA.Under the Act, the program consists essentially of three parts: testing,labeling, and mandatory energy conservation standards. The Department ofEnergy, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST), is required to amend or establish new test procedures as appropriatefor each of the covered products. Section 323. The purpose of the testprocedures is to provide for test results that reflect the energy efficiency,energy use, or estimated annual operating costs of each of the coveredproducts. Section 323(b)(3). The test procedures are an integral part ofthe energy conservation standards. The energy performance standards, i.e.,efficiency and consumption, are based on the test procedures found in subpartB to 10 CFR part 430. The test procedures are used by manufacturers tocertify compliance with the standards and will be used by the Departmentto determine compliance with the standards.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is required by the Act to prescriberules governing the labeling of covered products for which test procedureshave been prescribed by DOE. Section 324(a). These rules generally requirethat each particular model of a covered product bear a label that indicatesits annual operating cost and the range of estimated annual operating costsfor other models of that product. Section 324(c)(1). At the present timethere are FTC rules requiring labels for the following products: Room airconditioners, furnaces, clothes washers, dishwashers, water heaters, freezers,refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers, central air conditioners and centralair conditioning heat pumps, and fluorescent lamp ballasts. 44 FR 66475,November 19, 1979, 52 FR 46888, December 10, 1987, and 54 FR 28031, July5, 1989.For each of the 12 covered products, the Act prescribes an initial Federalenergy conservation standard. Section 325(b)-(h). The Act establishes effectivedates for the standards in 1988, 1990, 1992 or 1993, depending on the product,and specifies that the standards are to be reviewed by the Department within3 to 10 years, also depending on the product. Section 325(b)-(h). Afterthe specified period, DOE may promulgate new standards for each product;however, the Secretary may not prescribe any amended standard that increasesthe maximum allowable energy use, or decreases the minimum required energyefficiency, of a covered product. Section 325(l)(1). The Department's firstreview of standards is for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers.The Act also directs DOE to prescribe an energy conservation standard forsmall gas furnaces, i.e., gas furnaces having an input of less than 45,000Btu per hour and manufactured on or after January 1, 1992. Section 325(f)(1)(B).With regard to another covered product, television sets, the Act allowsthe Department to prescribe an applicable standard; however, such standardmay not become effective before January 1, 1992. Section 325(i)(3).Two products (refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers; and smallgas furnaces) are the subject of this rulemaking. As noted below in theproduct-specific discussion, the Department is postponing a final decisionon standards for television sets and will conduct a new analysis for televisionsets and publish a proposed rule based on that analysis.Any new or amended standard is required to be designed so as to achievethe maximum improvement in energy efficiency that is technologically feasibleand economically justified. Section 325(l)(2)(A).Section 325(l)(2)(B)(i) provides that before DOE determines whether a standardis economically justified, it must first solicit comments on a proposedstandard. After reviewing comments on the proposal, DOE must then determinethat the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens, based, to the greatestextent practicable, on a weighing of the following seven factors:(1) The economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on theconsumers of the products subject to such standard;(2) The savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average lifeof the covered product in the type (or class) compared to any increasein the price of, or in the initial charges for, or maintenance expensesof the covered products which are likely to result directly from the impositionof the standard;(3) The total projected amount of energy savings likely to result directlyfrom the imposition of the standard;(4) Any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered productslikely to result from the imposition of the standard;(5) The impact of any lessening of competition, determined in writing bythe Attorney General, that is likely to result from the imposition of thestandard;(6) The need for national energy conservation; and(7) Other factors the Secretary considers relevant.In addition, section 325(1)(2)(B)(ii) establishes a rebuttable presumptionof economic justification in instances where the Secretary determines that``the additional cost to the consumer of purchasing a product complyingwith an energy conservation standard level will be less than three timesthe value of the energy savings during the first year that the consumerwill receive as a result of the standard, as calculated under the applicabletest procedure * * *''Section 327 of the Act addresses the effect of Federal rules concerningtesting, labeling, and standards on State laws or regulations concerningsuch matters. Generally, all such State laws or regulations are supersededby the Act. Section 327(a)-(c). Exceptions to this general rule include:(1) State standards prescribed or enacted before January 3, 1987, and applicableto appliances produced before January 3, 1988, may remain in effect untilthe applicable standard begins (section 327(b)(1)); (2) State procurementstandards which are more stringent than the applicable Federal standard(section 327 (b)(2) and (e)) and certain building code requirements fornew construction, if certain criteria are met, are exempt from Federalpreemption (section 327 (b)(3) and (f) (1)-(4)); (3) State regulationsbanning constant burning pilot lights in pool heaters; and (4) State standardsfor television sets effective on or after January 1, 1992, may remain ineffect in the absence of a Federal standard for such product (section 327(b)(6)and 327(c)).Another exception to Federal preemption concerns standards for refrigerators,refrigerator-freezers and freezers. The Act specifies that if DOE doesnot publish a final rule before January 1, 1990, relating to the revisionof Federal standards for this product category, the State of California'sDecember 14, 1984, standards (effective January 1, 1992) for these products,would become effective in California beginning January 1, 1993, and maynot be preempted by any Federal standard. This exemption from preemptionby a Federal standard would exist as long as the California standard wasnot made more stringent. Section 325(b)(3)(A)(ii)(I) and section 327(c).In addition, if DOE does not publish a final rule before January 1, 1992,relating to the revision of standards for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers,and freezers, any State regulation which applies to such products manufacturedon or after January 1, 1995, is exempt from Federal preemption until theeffective date of a Federal standard. Section 325(b)(A)(ii)(II).b. BackgroundThe purpose of this rulemaking is two-fold: (1) To review the energy conservationstandards for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers (hereafterreferred to as refrigerators) that have been established by the Act; and,(2) to propose energy efficiency standards which are not less than 71 percentand not more than 78 percent AFUE (annual fuel utilization efficiency)\2\<NOTE/> for small gas furnaces, i.e., those having an input rateless than 45,000 Btu per hour.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ AFUE is the ratio of annual fuel output energy to annualfuel input energy, expressed as a percent.As directed by the Act, DOE published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking,with a 60-day comment period that ended February 5, 1988. (Hereafter referredto as the advance notice.) 52 FR 46367, December 7, 1987. The advance noticepresented the product classes that DOE planned to analyze, and provideda detailed discussion of the analytical methodology and analytical modelsthat the Department expected to use in performing the analysis to supportthis rulemaking. The Department invited comments and data on the accuracyand feasibility of the planned methodology and encouraged interested personsto recommend improvements or alternatives to DOE's approach. In addition,on January 28, 1988, a public hearing was held on the advance notice.On December 2, 1988, DOE published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerningrefrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers; small gas furnacesand television sets. (Hereafter referred to as the proposed rule.) 53 FR48798, December 2, 1988. The Department proposed to establish an energyconservation standard of 78 percent AFUE for small gas furnaces which wasthe highest level within the range (71 to 78 percent AFUE) for DOE to consideras set by the Act. For television sets, the Department proposed that anenergy conservation standard would not be economically justified. For refrigerators,DOE did not propose a specific standard level; rather, DOE solicited commentsand information within a range of standard levels. This range of standardlevels considered is shown in Table 1-1 below. The standards prescribedby the Act, effective January 1, 1990, and those prescribed today, effectiveJanuary 1, 1993, are shown in Table 1-2 below. During the 60-day commentperiod ending January 31, 1989, DOE received 120 written comments and testimonyfrom 33 participants at the public hearing held in Washington, DC, on January12 and 13, 1989.

General Discussion</ITAG>a. Maximum Technological Feasible LevelsThe Act requires that, in considering any new or amended standards, theDepartment must consider those that ``shall be designed to achieve themaximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determinesis technologically feasible and economically justified.'' (Section 325(1)(2)(A)). Accordingly, for each class of product that was under considerationin this rulemaking, a maximum technologically feasible level was identified.The maximum technologically feasible level is one that can be carried outby the addition of design options, both commercially feasible and prototypes,to the baseline units without affecting the product's utility. DOE believesthat the maximum technologically feasible level must be capable of beingassembled, but not necessarily manufactured, by the effective date of astandard.The maximum technologically feasible levels were derived by adding energy-conservingengineering design options to the respective classes in order of decreasingconsumer paybacks. Accordingly, the maximum technologically feasible levelfor refrigerator-freezers includes dual compressors and evacuated panels.A complete discussion of each maximum technologically feasible level, andthe design options included in each, is found in the Engineering Analysis.<T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, chapter 3.The ``max tech'' levels presented in this notice are predicated on theassumption that CFC-11 and -12 will not be available for refrigerator production.In the Engineering Analysis the Department applied a five percent efficiencypenalty for the CFC-11 substitute. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, chapter 3. If CFC-11 and -12 wereavailable for these designs, then the ``max tech'' levels could be evenmore efficient. A complete set of engineering cost-efficiency curves arepresented in the Engineering Analysis for refrigerators, including thosewith CFC-11 and -12.Table 2-1 presents the Department's maximum technologically feasible levelsfor the 10 refrigerator classes and 2 small gas furnace classes:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s150,xls120</C><T4>Table </T4>2-1._<T4>Maximum Technologically Feasible Levels</T4><H1>Products andamp; product classes</H1><H1>Unit energy consumption \1\</H1>Refrigerators:<ITAG tagnum="3">Manual defrost (17.0 cu. ft.) \2\</ITAG><D>325 kWh/yr.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Partial automatic defrost (16.8 cu. ft.)</ITAG><D>502 kWh/yr.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Automatic defrost top mount (20.8 cu. ft.)</ITAG><D>490 kWh/yr.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Automatic defrost side-by-side (24.1 cu. ft.)</ITAG><D>564 kWh/yr.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Automatic defrost side-by-side with through-the-door service features(31.9 cu. ft.)</ITAG><D>746 kWh/yr.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Automatic defrost top mount with through-the-door service features(20.8 cu. ft.)</ITAG><D>540 kWh/yr.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Automatic defrost bottom mount (22.8 cu. ft.)</ITAG><D>498 kWh/yr.</D>Freezers:<ITAG tagnum="3">Chest, manual defrost (22.5 cu. ft.)</ITAG><D>250 kWh/yr.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Upright, manual defrost (26.1 cu. ft.)</ITAG><D>423 kWh/yr.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Upright, automatic defrost (25.3 cu. ft.)</ITAG><D>588 kWh/yr.</D>Small Gas Furnaces:<ITAG tagnum="3">Non-weatherized (indoor)</ITAG><D>97% AFUE \3\.</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Weatherized (outdoor)</ITAG><D>97% AFUE \3\.</D><F>\1\ These maximum technologically feasible energy consumption levelsfor refrigerators/refrigerator-freezers/freezers are based on design optionsthat use substitutes for CFC-11 and -12.</F><F>\2\ Adjusted volume.</F><F>\3\ 78 percent AFUE is the maximum standard level that is allowed bythe Act for small gas furnaces.</F></ITAG>The Department believes that these are the maximum technologically feasibleenergy conservation levels from an engineering standpoint; with the exceptionof small gas furnaces, each of these levels was evaluated in accordancewith the economic justification factors specified in the Act to determineif the levels were economically justified. The maximum technologicallyfeasible levels for small gas furnaces were excluded from the analysis,since these levels are beyond the legislated range in which the Departmenthas to establish standards.The Department evaluated each maximum technologically feasible level todetermine if it would be economically justified at the time of the effectivedate of the standard. DOE rejected energy conservation standards that haveunacceptable impacts on consumers or manufacturers, e.g., unusually longpayback periods and negative impacts on manufacturers' returns-on-equity,or result in the changing of the utility of the product.b. Energy Savings1. <T3>Determination of Savings.</T3> The Department forecasts energy consumptionthrough the use of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential EnergyModel (LBL-REM). The LBL-REM forecasts energy consumption over the periodof analysis (1993-2015) for candidate standards and the base case.\3\<NOTE/> The Department quantified the energy savings that would beattributable to a standard as the difference in energy consumption betweenthe candidate standard's case and the base case.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ For refrigerators, the base case represents no standardsbeyond the Act's 1990 standards; for small gas furnaces, the base caserepresents no standards.The LBL-REM is fully explained in the Technical Support Document. AppendixB to that document addresses the LBL-REM in detail. The LBL-REM containsalgorithms to project average efficiencies, usage behavior, and marketshares for each product. The LBL-REM is used to project residential energy use over the relevanttime periods. By comparing the energy consumption projection at alternativestandards or no standards (for small furnaces), and at alternative standardlevels or the Act's 1990 standards (for refrigerators), the Departmentestimated the amount of energy projected to be saved during the period1993-2015.\4\<NOTE/> The energy saved is expressed in Quads, i.e., quadrillionBtu's. With respect to electricity, the savings are quads of source orprimary energy, which includes the energy necessary to generate and transmitelectricity. The Act defines ``energy use'' as the quantity of energy directlyconsumed by a consumer product at point of use. This is generally called``site'' energy, as opposed to ``source'' energy. There are major differencesbetween these types of energy. In 1987, the amount of electrical energyconsumed at the site was less than one-third of the amount of source energythat was required to generate and transmit the site electrical energy.\5\<NOTE/> Therefore, it is important to identify whether the electricityinvolved is site or source energy.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ LBL-REM analyzed a single standard level or alternativelevels over the entire period. That is, the fact that a standard mightbe revised during subsequent rulemakings was not considered by the model.The Department believes that it is not possible to predict what resultsuch reviews may have, and therefore it would be speculative to model anyparticular result. Therefore, for purposes of this reulemaking, each standardlevel that was analyzed was projected to have been in place from the timeof implementation to the year 2015.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Energy Information Administration, <T3>Electric Power Annual 1987, </T3>Tables 25 and 82, DOE/EIA-0348(87),1988.The LBL-REM projections are dependent on many assumptions. Among the mostimportant are responsiveness of household appliance purchases to changesin energy prices and consumer income, future energy prices, future levelsof housing construction, and options that exist for improving the energyefficiency of appliances. As is the case with any complicated computermodel simulation, the validity of the outputs is critically dependent onthe inputs. Under section 325(l)(3)(B) of the Act, the Department is prohibited fromadopting a standard for a product if that standard would not result in``significant'' energy savings. While the term ``significant'' has neverbeen defined in the Act, the Department believes that a standard leveloption need not meet a threshold level of energy savings to be considereda ``significant'' saver of energy. The U.S. Court of Appeals, <T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>Herrington,</T3> 768 F.2d 1355 (D.C. Cir. 1985), concluded that Congressionalintent in using the word ``significant'' was to mean ``non-trivial.'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 1373. Thus, for this rulemaking, DOE believes that eachcandidate standard considered results in significant energy savings.c.Rebuttable Presumption NAECA established new criteria for determining whether a standard levelis economically justified. Section 325(l)(2)(B)(iii) states:<ITAG tagnum="21">If the Secretary finds that the additional cost to the consumer ofpurchasing a product complying with an energy conservation standard levelwill be less than three times the value of the energy savings during thefirst year that the consumer will receive as a result of the standard,as calculated under the applicable test procedure, there shall be a rebuttablepresumption that such standard level is economically justified. A determinationby the Secretary that such criterion is not met shall not be taken intoconsideration in the Secretary's determination of whether a standard iseconomically justified.</ITAG>If the increase in initial price of an appliance due to a conservationstandard would repay itself to the consumer in energy savings in less thanthree years, then it can be presumed that such standard is economicallyjustified.\6\<NOTE/> This presumption of economic justification can be rebuttedupon a proper showing.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ For this calculation, cost-of-operation, i.e., energysaving, is derived from the DOE test procedures. See andSection;andSection;430.22 (a) and (n). Consumers who use the products less than the test procedureassumes will experience a longer payback while those who use them morethan the test procedure assumes will have a shorter payback. d. EconomicJustificationAs noted earlier, section 325(l)(2)(B)(i) of the Act provides seven factorsto be evaluated in determining whether a conservation standard is economicallyjustified.1. <T3>Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers.</T3> The engineeringanalysis identified improvements in efficiency along with the associatedcosts to manufacturers for each class of product. For each design option,these costs constitute the increased per unit cost to manufacturers toachieve the indicated energy efficiency levels. Manufacturer, wholesaler,and retailer markups will result in a consumer purchase price higher thanthe manufacturer cost.To assess the likely impacts of standards on manufacturers, and to determinethe effects of standards on different-sized firms, the Department useda computer model that simulated hypothetical firms in the industries underconsideration. This model, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory ManufacturerImpact Model (LBL-MIM), is explained fully in the Technical Support Document.<T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Appendix C. LBL-MIM provides abroad array of outputs. The outputs are shipments, price, revenue, netincome, and return-on-equity (ROE). An ``Output Table'' lists values forall these in the base case and in each of the standards cases under consideration.It also gives a range for each of these estimates. A ``Sensitivity Chart''shows how ROE would be affected by a change in any one of the model's ninecontrol variables.For consumers, measures of economic impact are the changes in purchaseprice and annual energy expense. The purchase price and annual energy expenseof each standard level are presented in Chapter 6 of the Technical SupportDocument. 2. <T3>Life-Cycle Costs (LCC).</T3> One measure of the effect of proposedstandards on consumers is the change in life-cycle costs resulting fromstandards. This is quantified by the difference in life-cycle cost (LCC)between the base and standards case for the appliance classes analyzed.The LCC is the sum of the purchase price and the operating expense, incudingmaintenance expenditures, discounted over the lifetime of the appliance.The LCC was calculated for the range of efficiencies in the EngineeringAnalysis for each class of product in the year standards are imposed. Thepurchase price is based on the factory costs in the Engineering Analysisand includes a factory markup plus a distributor and retailer markup. Energyprice forecasts are inputs that are taken from the 1989 <T3>Annual Energy Outlook</T3> of the Energy Information Administration.Appliance usage inputs for refrigerators are taken from the refrigeratortest procedure and for small gas furnaces are taken from the furnace testprocedure and modified to adjust from laboratory to field usage. The differences in life-cycle costs between the base case and various levelsof standards for refrigerators and small gas furnaces are presented inTables 6.1-6.3 of the Technical Support Document. These LCC's are calculatedat a seven percent discount rate; a higher rate, e.g., ten percent, givesa smaller difference between standards cases and the base case, while alower rate, e.g., five percent, produces a greater difference. This resultsbecause the consumer benefits, i.e., reduced operating expenses accrueover the life of the appliance and are discounted back to some base year.Therefore, the lower the discount rate, the greater the resulting consumerbenefits after discounting. In addition, as can be seen in the variousLCC curves, the use of a higher discount rate results in a flatter curve.When the LCC numbers are plotted graphically (on the Y axis) against unitenergy consumption (on the X axis), the data generally produce a curvethat is concave from above in shape. This means that at first the LCC curvewill decline as efficiency improvements are made, will reach a minimum(which may or may not be discrete), and then rise. This indicates thatthe first efficiency improvements will produce energy savings, the valueof which will more than pay for the design change. As additional efficiencyimprovements are made, it becomes increasingly costly to save more energy,and, eventually, the value of the energy savings will not cover the expendituresfor the design improvements. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Figures 6.1-6.12. The minimum of the LCC curve was of particular interest in the analysis.The minimum of the curve represents that level of efficiency improvementsthat maximizes the difference between the value of energy saved and theadditional consumer expenditures for the relevant efficiency improvements.Therefore, design options that corresponded to the minimum point were ofspecial consideration in establishing standard levels. The Department conducted a net present value (NPV) analysis to assess thedifferential economic impacts on consumers that would occur from the adoptionof standards (for small gas furnaces) and amended standards (for refrigerators)compared to a base case with no-standards (for small gas furnaces) andthe Act's 1990 standards (for refrigerators). <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Chapter 5. The LBL-REM calculatesthe total expenditure for each product (discounted total value of energyconsumption from 1992 through the last year of use for those products purchasedthrough the year 2015, plus the total discounted expenses for equipmentpurchased from 1992 through 2015), with and without standards (for smallfurnaces), and with more stringent standards and with the Act's 1990 standards(for refrigerators). The NPV analysis is similar to the LCC analysis, inthat the greatest NPV should occur at the standard level that correspondsto the LCC minimum for the product.\7\<NOTE/> The NPV for each product at the different standard levelsis identified in section IV of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The net present value (NPV) of a standard, per appliance,is calculated for all affected appliances that are purchased in the projectionperiod, while the life-cycle cost (LCC) is calculated only for the lifetimeof an appliance that is purchased in the first year of the relevant standard.Therefore, NPV and LCC estimates, per appliance, may not correlate exactly.3. <T3>Energy Savings.</T3> While the significant conservation of energy isa separate statutory requirement for imposing an energy conservation standard,the Act requires DOE, in determining the economic justification of a standard,to consider the total projected savings that are expected to result directlyfrom new or revised standards. DOE used the LBL-REM results, discussedearlier, in its consideration of total projected savings. The savings areprovided in section IV of this notice. 4. <T3>Lessening of Utility or Performance of Products.</T3> This factor cannotbe quantified. In establishing classes of products and design options,the Department tried to eliminate any degradation of utility or performancein the two products under consideration in this rulemaking. That is, tothe extent that comments, or DOE's own research, indicated that a productincluded a utility or performance-related feature that affected energyefficiency, a separate class with a different efficiency standard was createdfor this product. In this way the Department attempted to minimize theimpact of this factor as a result of the standards that were analyzed.However, other factors, in conjunction with standards, could affect theutility or performance of products subject to standards. For example, theEPA limitations on chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) production could cause refrigeratormanufacturers to adopt alternatives to the regulated CFCs which could affectthe referigerator's utility or performance. If this occurs, DOE is notable to assure that utility and performance would not be affected by standards.5. <T3>Impact of Lessening of Competition. </T3>The determination of thisfactor is to be made by the Attorney General. This determination is presentedfor each product in section IV of today's notice. In addition, a copy ofthe Attorney General's letter containing the findings is published in today's<T4>Federal Register.</T4>6. <T3>Need of the Nation to Conserve Energy. </T3>With increasing concernabout the prospects of polluted air, acid rain and global warming, somehave argued that energy conservation, including more stringent energy conservationstandards, is necessary to help alleviate those prospects. Accordingly,results from the environmental assessment for each product will be reportedconcerning this factor in the product specific discussion (section IV)of this notice.7. <T3>Other Factors. </T3>This provision allows the Secretary of Energy,in determining whether a standard is economically justified, to considerany other factors that he deems to be relevant. The only such factor thathas been identified is the EPA regulation to restrict the production ofcertain CFCs. This factor, too, is discussed in section IV of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of Comments</ITAG>The Department received 120 written comments in response to the December1988 proposed rule, and received testimony from 33 persons at the January12-13, 1989, public hearing. These comments addressed all aspects of theanalysis. In this section, the Department will discuss the general analyticalissues raised by the comments; and then, the product-specific issues.a. General Analytical Comments<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Energy Projections</ITAG>In the analysis for the proposed rule, the Department used energy priceforecasts from the 1986 Annual Energy Outlook of the Energy InformationAdministration. The American Gas Association (AGA) contended that theseprice forecasts should be updated. (AGA, No. 128, at 16-17).\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Comments on the proposed rule have been assigned docketnumbers and have been numbered consecutively. Statements that were presentedat the January 12 and 13, 1989, public hearing are identified as Testimony.The Department agrees with AGA and has updated the energy price projectionsby incorporating the forecasts from the 1989 Annual Energy Outlook (DOE/EIA-0383(89)).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Discount Rate Selection</ITAG>In the Department's analysis for the proposed rulemaking, a seven percentdiscount rate was used to calculate consumer life-cycle costs and net presentvalues.The Department received numerous comments on the choice of an appropriatediscount rate.\9\<NOTE/> Among those supporting a lower rate, generally either threeor four percent, were the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) (RMI, No. 49,at 1), the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) (NRDC, No. 81, at 8-9),the Northwest Conservation Act Coalition (NCAC) (NCAC, No. 91, at 1), MassachusettsExecutive Office of Energy Resources (Mass) (Mass, No. 107, at 5), theCalifornia Energy Commission (CEC) (CEC, No. 108, at 17), Edison ElectricInstitute (EEI) (EEI, No. 127, at 10), Ohio Office of the Consumer's Counsel(Ohio) (Ohio, No. 138, at 7), and Representative Edward J. Markey (Markey,No. 151, at 3).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Since the benefits of improved efficiency and the expensesof obtaining and maintaining the more efficient equipment accrue at differentrates over time, the values must be stated in terms of a common point intime. Usually this common time is the present, and the expense and benefitflows are discounted to present values through the application of an appropriatediscount rate. This rate is typically independent of price changes andtax considerations; as such, it is a real, after-tax rate.The principal argument offered in support of a lower rate is that applianceenergy conservation standards have benefits that accrue to all of society,and these positive benefits should be accounted for by a reduction in thediscount rate for the individual purchasers of the energy saving appliances.The Department agrees that all of society benefits from energy-conservingappliances, e.g., more energy-efficient appliances can help reduce theneed to build additional electrical generating plants, and thereby havepositive economic and environmental effects that can be enjoyed by allmembers of society. It is also true, however, that most of the benefitsfrom more efficient appliances are realized by the individual purchasersof those appliances, while those benefits that are collective in natureand benefit all members of society, e.g., the environmental benefits mentionedabove, are properly tallied in the environmental assessment that the Departmentmust conduct for the rulemaking, and are considered under the economicjustification factors. Such external benefits from the purchase of energyconserving appliances should not be used to support a lower discount ratefor calculating the benefits to the individual purchasers.Social discount rates can be appropriate in situations where there aresignificant societal benefits that cannot be estimated. However, even inthose circumstances, there is a practical problem in determining what thatrate should be, that is, by what amount the private discount rate shouldbe lowered in order to account for the benefits that accrue to all of society.Most of the comments that argue for a social discount rate suggested, asnoted above, lowering the individual purchaser's rate to three or fourpercent. None of these comments, however, offers any theoretical or empiricalbasis to support such a reduction, and the Department, therefore, rejectssuch calls for lowering the individual purchaser's discount rate. Furthermore,as noted above, many of the benefits that accrue to all of society frommore energy-efficient appliances are, the Department believes, environmentalbenefits, which are calculated in the Environmental Assessment (DOE/EA-0386).Any additional social benefits that might exist from an individual's purchaseof more energy-efficient appliances are, DOE believes, not sufficientlylarge or inestimable to warrant reducing the consumer's discount rate.The use of a three percent discount rate has no reasoned theoretical basis.It is not related to the opportunity cost of money for purchasing consumerdurables. It represents the extreme of the calculations of the social discountrate in a more general context, and is thus suspect on these grounds. Finally,the use of a three percent discount rate does not change the results qualitatively.For refrigerators, as seen in the Technical Support Document, standardlevel 3 has certain positive benefits, greater in magnitude than resultscalculated at a higher discount rate. Level 4 has even higher benefits,but is rejected for reasons not related to the discount rate and the calculatedlife-cycle-cost and net present value.The principal exception to those who argued for a lower discount rate wasa comment offerd by Battelle (Battelle) on behalf of the Association ofHome Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM). (Battelle, No. 110, at 8-18 and 32-34).Battelle stated that consumers' past implicit discount rates \1\\0\<NOTE/> for appliances have been calculated to be in the 40 to 100percent range. These rates are implicit discount rates, developed fromdata on past consumer purchases. Based on these data, Battelle contendsthat the discount rate, to be used in the analysis, should be no lowerthan 20 percent.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ The implicit discount rate is a measure of marketplacebehavior where, using historical data, a discount rate is calculated thatwould result in the shipment weighted energy factor (SWEF) coinciding withthe minimum LCC point.DOE reviewed these comments and found several problems with Battelle'srecommendation. First, the implicit discount rate is a value, initiallycalculated from historical data, that is used by LBL-REM in the projectionof efficiency choices. LBL-REM uses implicit (market) discount rates thatcharacterize the market-place's trade-off of purchase price against operatingexpense. For refrigerators, these values are calculated from purchase data,including the shipment weighted energy factor for 1987, which was obtainedfrom AHAM. The implicit discount rates used in the proposed rule were reportedfor each class in table B.2 of the Technical Support Document, and rangefrom 78 to 279 percent. Implicit discount rates for the small gas furnaceclasses were calculated to be 16 and 20 percent; these were used in theproposed rule and are also reported in Table B.2 of the Technical SupportDocument.Secondly, household appliances are considered to be consumer durable goods,not investment goods. This definition has been accepted elsewhere in theFederal government; for example, the U.S. Department of Commerce's <T3>Survey of Current Business </T3>reports expenditures on appliancesin this way. A consumer durable good is one that is expected to last morethan one year. All of the appliances that are covered by the Act fall intothis category.The return to a consumer of an appliance is the utility that is derivedfrom having and using the product. The consumer will spend on appliancesup to the point that the marginal utility that he derives is equal to thepurchase price. The idea of a monetary payback from consuming an appliance is contraryto economic thought. Only investment goods are expected to yield a monetaryreturn. Furthermore, to calculate a rate of return to consumers from consumingan appliance, one would need some cardinal measure of their individualutility schedules, and would need to make interpersonal comparisons ofthem. Both of these concepts are contrary to economic theory and application.\11\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ See, for example, Donald Stevenson Watson, <T3>Price Theory and Its Uses, </T3>Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1963,Chs. 4 and 5, esp. pages 59-61 and 68-71. For an additional critique ofthe practicality of cardinal measurement of utility, see William S. Vickrey,<T3>Microstatics, </T3>New York: Harcourt Bruce andamp; World, Incorporated,1964, pp. 36-51. Although the concept of paybacks from the consumption of a consumer durableis contrary to economics, such is the approach that has been taken by thosewho argue that the ``correct'' discount rates to use in consumer life-cyclecost and net present value calculations for the appliance standards programare the implicit discount rates derived from past consumer appliance purchasedata. It has been suggested by some that, since many of the appliances underthis program are ``necessities,'' the average model should be considereda consumer durable, but that any additional price paid for a more energy-efficientmodel could be considered a consumer investment, against which monetaryreturns can be calculated. It is then suggested that the rate of thesereturns should be used as discount rates in the life-cycle-cost and netpresent value calculations. This approach has some conceptual appeal; however, there would be problemswith its implementation. Such a calculation would be appropriate wherethe more energy-efficient model differed from the average model only inits improved energy-efficiency. If there were other differences in featuresbetween the two appliances, the extra price for the more energy-conservingmodel could be at least partly related to those different features; therefore,the extra price would not be solely for the energy conserving aspect ofthe more efficient machine, and calculating rates of return based on thatextra price would not produce a rate of return from the aspect of investingin energy-efficiency. Finally, the proposal to use a discount rate of 20 percent is counter tothe practice of government agencies that are evaluating either regulatoryprogram or government investments. In the evaluation of regulations, regulatoryagencies often use (real) discount rates of three to seven percent. Forexample, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in performing its regulatoryimpact assessment of the Montreal Protocol, used a 3 percent real discountrate. DOE, in evaluating Voluntary Energy Conservation Performance Standardsfor Commercial and Multi-family High Rise Residential Buildings used aseven percent real discount rate. Even if the arguments for the use of a higher discount rate were accepted,they would not change the results of the analysis qualitatively. For refrigerators,at a ten percent discount rate, the level 3 standards would have some positivebenefits (although reduced from the benefits calculated at seven percent.The net benefits of the level 3 standards would be higher than level 2or level 4. In deriving the seven percent discount rate that was used in the proposedrule, DOE was guided by the Court decision. <T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>Herrington, supra </T3>at 110. In the December 22, 1982, and August1983 final rules concerning appliance energy efficiency standards, DOEused a ten percent discount rate. In dismissing the ten percent discountrate, the Court presented, without comment, a methodology for calculatinga discount rate for consumer life-cycle cost and net present value calculations.The methodology was a calculation of the interest charged on consumer loans,minus the tax deductibility of such interest, minus the rate of inflation;this yields a real, after-tax, rate of interest. The applicability of that methodology changed considerably with passageof the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-514). The Tax Reform Act phasesout the tax deductibility of interest paid on consumer loans (the phase-outwill be complete at the end of 1990). DOE used that methodology in calculatinga discount rate for the December 1988 proposed rule. The Department examinedinterest rates on consumer loans (then about 12 percent) and deducted theexpected annual rate of price increases (often used as a measure of theinflation rate) in the early 1990's (then forecasted to be around 5 percent).With the passage of the Tax Reform Act, the issue became more complex.To the extent that purchases of more efficient appliances occur along withthe sale of new homes, then the purchase prices of those appliances areoften being financed by the interest rate on the mortgage, which is typicallylower than interest on consumer installment loans, and is also fully taxdeductible. Therefore, in order to derive an appropriate discount ratefor these purchasers, it is necessary to estimate the expected mortgageinterest rates, as well as the percentage of shipments of refrigeratorsand small furnaces that are expected to be installed in new homes. Whenthis rule is effective in 1993, there are projections that the fixed contractmortgage rate for conventional commitments will be 10.78 percent.\12\<NOTE/> For a purchaser in a marginal tax rate of, say, 28 percent,the after tax rate of interest paid would be 7.76 percent (10.78 x .72).Furthermore, it is estimated that the annual rate of price increases in1993 will be 4.7 percent.\13\<NOTE/> Therefore, the net, after tax, real rate of interest to theseconsumers would be 3.06 percent (7.76-4.70).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ DRI/McGraw-Hill, <T3>U.S. Long-Term Review; Winter 1988-89, Table 6.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ <T3>Idid.</T3>, Table 1.However, only a fraction of the units are expected to be installed in newhomes and, thus, qualify for such a favorable interest rate. Accordingto projections in the LBL-REM, around 60 percent of the small furnace shipments,and more than 30 percent of refrigerator shipments in 1993 are expectedto be installed in new homes.Presumably, then, 40 percent of small furnace shipments and 70 percentof refrigerator shipments in 1993 will be purchased as replacements andinstalled in existing homes. How these units are purchased would indicatean appropriate discount rate. For example, some replacement purchases couldbe made through home equity loans, the interest for which would be fullytax deductible. Many other replacements will be bought with cash that iswithdrawn from savings or by an unsecured, personal loan.For cash purchases, the relevant interest expense is the foregone interestthat those savings could have earned. In 1993, time deposits, i.e., savingsaccounts, are expected to be earning between 7.72 and 7.79 percent interest.\14\<NOTE/> Since such interest, if earned, would be fully taxable, thenet, after tax earnings that are foregone are between 5.55 and 5.61 percentfor an individual in a 28 percent marginal tax bracket. Subtracting theexpected rate of price increases (4.7 percent), one obtains a resultingdiscount rate of 0.85 to 0.91 percent.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ <T3>Ibid.</T3>, Table 23.Many consumers, however, will purchase their appliances by taking out unsecured,personal loans, which are likely to carry interest rates of 18 to 20 percent;these interest payments would not be tax deductible. The discount ratefor this group of purchasers would be as high as 13.3 to 15.3 percent.As the foregoing discussion indicates, there is a wide range of possiblediscount rates to be used in calculating life-cycle costs and net presentvalues. The range is from approximately 1 percent to slightly more than15 percent.Although many of the purchasers of these appliances should have real, aftertax interest payments below 7 percent, many will have payments in excessof 15 percent; thus it would appear that the use of a seven percent ratein the consumer life-cycle cost and net present value calculations is justified.Since one discount rate is to apply in all the calculations, the Departmentused a rate approximately at the mid-point of the potential consumer discountrates.This approach has several advantages. First, it has a reasoned theoreticaljustification in that it is related to the opportunity cost of money forpurchasing consumer durables; as such, it is justified in terms of thealternate consumer investment opportunities that are forgone in order tofinance the purchases of the appliances. Secondly, use of a higher ratewould arbitrarily bias the LCC results upward, while a lower rate wouldcreate biases in the opposite direction.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Selection of Candidate Standard Levels</ITAG>In the proposed rule, the Department indicated that its selection of candidatestandard levels was dependent on the consumer life-cycle cost curves thatwere developed in the analysis. These curves were calculated by estimatingthe expected initial price increase that such additional design optionswould cause, adding the discounted value of maintenance and operating expenses,and comparing them to the discounted value of energy savings that wouldresult from those design options. The selection criteria were to consideras possible standard levels as many points from the curves as would bepractical. Two levels that were considered as standards were the maximumtechnologically feasible levels, as required by the Act, and the LCC minimawhich, at least theoretically, should maximize the benefits to the consumer.In addition, in the case of classes of refrigerators, the Department considered,as candidate standard levels, up to three points less efficient than theLCC minima.NCAC and Ohio suggested that LCC points occurring between the LCC minimaand the maximum technologically feasible should be considered as viablecandidate levels. (NCAC, No. 91, at 2; Ohio, No. 138, at 3).DOE disagrees with the comment. The Department analyzed the LCC minimaand maximum technologically feasible levels for refrigerators, and foundboth levels not to be economically justified. While there is an engineeringdesign that falls between the LCC minima and the maximum technologicallyfeasible, the Department believes that if two standard levels are foundnot to be economically justified, the levels between them are also noteconomically justified.The CEC said that the establishment of a revised standard that is lessefficient than the lowest LCC point is not economically justified. (CEC,No. 108, at 30).The Department disagrees with the CEC's statement; the standards decisionis based on a review of the analytical results, after taking all sevenfactors of economic justification into consideration. The LCC results arejust one of the factors that is considered.Jon Leber (Leber), a professional engineer, noted that DOE incorrectlystated that ``at efficiency levels beyond the LCC minima, the incrementalfirst cost of the product exceeds the value of the energy savings suchthat the average consumer does not realize a benefit from the investment.''DOE agrees; Mr. Leber correctly notes that, in such a situation, ``Theconsumers will still realize a benefit from the investment but the ratioof the benefit to the cost will now be less than one.'' (Leber, No. 155,at 1).Ohio maintained that Congress clearly did not intend for DOE to excludeconsidering the benefits of energy efficiency that go beyond those thatare represented in a life-cycle cost comparison. (Ohio, No. 138, at 7).The Department agrees with Ohio, and notes that the LCC comparison wasjust one of the seven factors of economic justification that was consider.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Calculation of Energy Savings</ITAG>Some comments questioned the Department's calculations of energy savings.The CEC contended that historically the average efficiency resulting froma new standard has overshot the theoretical market minimum by five to tenpercent, and that DOE has underestimated the actual energy savings andeconomic benefits that will accrue from standards by at least that amount.(CEC, Testimony, January 12, 1989).The Department notes overshoot means the positive difference between maximumunit energy consumption standard levels, and the average unit energy consumptionactually attained by models sold after standards are implemented. For example,actual unit energy consumption may be five percent or more lower than standardlevels.DOE did not assume an overshoot, but adhered to its methodology, that,in the base case, the market will demand a range of efficiencies such thatthe SWEF exceeds the 1990 standard (in the case of refrigerators). In thestandards cases, designs which met or went beyond the standard were consideredto be available for purchase and were used to calculate a new SWEF. Whileno arbitrary overshoot was assumed, the average efficiency projected afterstandards by this method is allowed to go beyond the standard by an amountdepending upon the base case distribution of efficiencies. In looking atthe SWEF under each standard level, the Department is confident that ithas captured all of the energy savings that each candidate standard levelcould generate.It should be noted that the more stringent the standard level, the closerthat the SWEF will be to the standard level, and the lower that the overshootwill be. LBL-REM SWEF projections are found in Tables 5.6, 5.7, and 5.16of the Technical Support Document.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Reporting of the Environmental Benefits of Standards</ITAG>In reporting the results of the analysis in the proposed rule, the Departmentpresented the environmental effects of standards only in the EnvironmentalAssessment (DOE/EA-0372, November 1988). The Solar Energy Association ofOregon (SEAO) commented that, in determining the economic justificationof candidate standards, the Department should consider the environmentalbenefits that it calculates would result from candidate standards. (SEAO,No. 44, at 2). In addition, Representative Markey commented that mitigatingglobal warming and pollution are important for our national security. (Markey,No. 151, at 2).Under the economic justification factor, Need of the Nation to ConserveEnergy, as discussed above, the Department considered the environmentaleffects that are expected to result from standards. These effects are reportedfor each product in section IV of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Choice of Proposed Standard Levels</ITAG>In the proposed rule, the Department proposed a range of refrigerator standards,from not amending the 1990 standards through standard level 3. All of thesepossible standards were found to save a significant amount of energy, betechnologically feasible, and be economically justified.RMI commented that although the Department found that standard levels 4and 5 also satisfied those requirements, it did not propose either, thereby``violating the law.'' (RMI, No. 49, at 2).The Department notes that RMI is mistaken; in fact, in the proposed rule,the Department said that both standard levels 4 and 5 would be technologicallyfeasible and would result in a significant conservation of energy, butthat the Department found that they were not economically justified.GE and AHAM commented that the Department should not adopt refrigeratorstandards that are based on the scenario used for the proposed rule (inwhich it was assumed that CFC-11 and -12 would be available for refrigeratorproduction), since that analysis did not consider the phase-out of CFCs.(GE, No. 125, at 7; and AHAM, No. 137, at 2).While there is much speculation and many proposals concerning the phase-outof CFC-11 and -12, the Montreal Protocol calls for an immediate rollbackof production to 1986 levels with a 50 percent cut of those levels by 1998.As a result, various chemical companies and laboratories are doing researchon finding replacement chemicals. However, the record is fairly clear thatreplacement chemicals will not be available by 1993 when these standardsgo into effect.DOE believes that CFC-11 and -12 will be available to refrigeration manufacturersin 1993 and probably will still be available in 1997, although at higherprices. The Department believes that, short of some new treaty or legislation,any transition from CFC-11 and -12 over the 1993 to 1998 time span willoccur voluntarily. However, DOE believes that such a transition would likelyoccur; therefore, the analysis was modified to include the possibilitythat it occurs before 1998. To accomplish this, the analysis was dividedinto two parts. For the period 1993 through 1995, it was assumed that CFC-11and -12 are available, and for the period 1996 and beyond, it was assumedthey are replaced.For this later time period, the engineering analysis was modified as discussed,<T3>supra,</T3> in the ``Product-Specific Analytical Comments for Refrigerators''to include features such as enhanced heat transfer for evaporators anddual compressors. Other features, such as the 5.3 EER compressor and enhancedperformance foam insulation (k=.10), were deleted, since such designs arenot likely to be achievable without CFCs. A 5.3 EER compressor needs CFC-12as a working fluid to achieve its maximum efficiency. Based on announcementsfrom Dupont, it was assumed that a replacement for CFC-12 becomes availablewith no performance penalty. In addition, based on results of tests conductedby the Mobay Corporation \15\<NOTE/>, it was assumed that the replacement for CFC-11 will havea five percent penalty in insulation performance. The thermal conductivityof 0.1275 Btu-in/hranddegrees;F ft 2 was used in the analysis for today'sfinal rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Dietrich, K. W. and H. P. Doerge, ``Performance of AlternativeChlorofluorocarbons in Rigid Urethane Appliance Foams,'' in <T3>Proceedings of SPI; 31st Annual Technical/Marketing Conference,</T3>October 18-21. 1988, pp. 141-147.In addition to a performance penalty for the CFC-11 substitute, the Departmentalso assumed a price penalty for both CFC-11 and CFC-12 substitutes. Thispenalty was to assume a three-fold increase in price.The engineering analysis presented in the proposed rule is still used forthe earlier time period; the Department chose to modify the engineeringanalysis only slightly, because the Department believes it still is generallyrepresentative of the possibilities with CFC-11 and -12 being available.The slight modifications included increasing the estimates of evacuatedpanel costs, and, as baseline volumes were adsjusted, recomputing the baselinecost estimates.All impacts of the refrigerator standards presented today are a resultof the original engineering analysis being used for 1993 through 1995 andthe modified engineering analysis, with its different costs and features,being used from 1996 and beyond. The Department believes that this representsa conservative but plausible scenario for the possibility of a transitionaway from the CFC-11 and -12.Both the with- and without CFC-11 and -12 scenarios were used in the LBL-REM,LBL-MIM, and in the environmental analyses. As the scenarios changed inputsto LBL-REM, the LBL-REM fed into LBL-MIM and the environmental analysesand affected their results, also.The Department notes that in the above scenario the consumer paybacks presentedare based on the earlier CFC case, since the Department believes that theAct requires those estimates to be presented for the year in which thestandards are to be effective. The trial standard levels, however, werebased on costs and efficiencies achievable with alternatives to CFC-11and -12, i.e., the post-1995 scenario.b. Product-Specific Analytical Comments<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Refrigerators</ITAG>A. <T3>Engineering Analysis:</T3> The comments on the engineering analysisof refrigerators dealt with a variety of issues, ranging from the Department'smethodological approach and assumptions to its estimates and calculations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Evacuated Panel Costs and Energy Efficiency</ITAG>One comment contended that, in the analysis for the proposed rule, theDepartment had underestimated the costs and overestimated the associatedK value for evacuated panel insulation. (Admiral, No. 135, at 2). GeneralElectric's (GE's) comment, however, supported the K value (of 0.05 fora composite of evacuated panel and foam insulation) used by the Department.(GE, No. 125, in Appendices 6 and 7).With regard to the underestimation of cost, for the analysis for the finalrule, the Department agrees that an increase in its estimate of evacuatedpanel costs is justified after receiving comments from Admiral, who hasperformed research on the development of vacuum panels.DOE agrees with GE that the K value for a composite wall of foam insulationands an evacuated panel is correctly represented by 0.05. The Departmentrealizes that Admiral's original estimate of K value was speculative. However,DOE is relying more on GE's comment, since that company has actually manufacturedpowder filled panels in refrigerator-freezers, and, therefore, has actualknowledge of what the K factor can be.<ITAG tagnum="84">Evacuated panel availability</ITAG>Amana Refrigeration, Inc., (Amana, No. 87, at 1-3) believes that the argumentsconcerning the future availability of evacuated panels for industry wideuse are ill-considered. The statement identified a single, but all-importantfacet of this emerging technology; namely, the supply of ultra-fine silicapowders which have thus far been the best candidates for filler materialfor two types of panels.Amana stated that based upon the several patents issued and other literaturecovering this subject area, fumed silica and precipitated silica are thepremier candidates for filler material in evacuated panels. When utilizedin a plastic pouch and evacuated to an absolute pressure of approximately0.1 Torr, the densified silica weighs approximately 8.0 to 9.8 lbs perft\3\. (This is the powder-filled panel produced by GE). Fumed silica tendsto have a smaller particle size (0.8 um) than the fine precipitated silicas(1.3 to 2.0 um), thus tending to be a more consistent insulator.With this information, Amana provided a ``what if'' scenario, for a hypotheticaluse of evacuated panels in the industry's refrigerator and refrigerator/freezerproducts. First, Amana made several assumptions:(1) The industry's annual production of 6.9 million refrigerators and refrigerator/freezersin 1988 will continue at that level.(2) The 18 cu. ft. top freezer model described in the Technical SupportDocument represents an ``average'' model for the purpose of calculatingmaterial requirements.(3) That a composite insulation structure consisting of \1/2\andmin16;andmin16;thick panels (R=10) and foamed-in-place polyurethane represents a viablestructure for consideration.(4) That the evacuated panels should substantially cover the entire innersurface (5 sides) of the refrigerator outer case to achieve the benefitsof enhanced insulation. For the assumed model described in the TechnicalSupport Document engineering analysis, this could require as much as 45ft\2\ of evacuated panel. The silica material required then ranges from15.5 to 18.6 lbs. per unit. (The lower number refers to fumed silica fillers;the higher to precipitated silica.)DOE believes that these four assumptions are reasonable for this analysis.Amana's fifth and all important assumption is that the entire Industryhas to install evacuated panels in all its products by 1993_a purely hypotheticalscenario.Amana, using the assumptions above, demonstrates that industry requirementsfor fumed and precipitated silica for evacuated panel use are in the rangeof from 107 to 128 million pounds, annually. Since the entire United States'production capability for manufacturing these materials is estimated tobe approximately 200 million pounds annually, the refrigeration industry'srequirements could consume over 60 percent of the entire national supply.This would be an untenable situation, and the suppliers of silica powderswould need to enhance their productive capability significantly.A fumed silica manufacturing plant with an annual capacity of 11 millionpounds represents a $40 million investment, not including the siting andenvironmental protection costs. To meet the hypothetical demand noted above,ten such plants would be needed. Erection and prove-out time requirementswould range from 3 to 4 years after site selection, zoning approvals, environmentalimpact statements, and other preliminary procedures were completed.Quantum Optics testified that ``Aerogels are now available only in limitedquantities, but several projects are underway that could lead to productionfor the entire refrigerator industry by 1993 if adequate investment capitalis committed.'' (Quantum Optics, Testimony, January 12, 1989).DOE has reviewed the comments, and believes that the chemical industrywill not be able to make sufficient quantities of silica commercially availableby 1993; and, therefore rejects this technology as being economically justified.<ITAG tagnum="84">Additivity of Energy Impacts of Design Options</ITAG>White Consolidated Industries (WCI) stated that the analysis was ``notadequate for standard setting. Often various design changes interact witheach other or with existing systems. The results are rarely additive assimplistically assumed by (the Department's) analysis.'' (WCI, No. 78,at 5).The Department agrees that because designs can interact, the energy impactsare not necessarily additive. That is why the Department computed independentlythe energy impacts of each combination of designs. Simulations were runfor each combination of design options as shown in the Technical SupportDocument. Interactions among design options were accounted for as partof the simulation model.<ITAG tagnum="84">Estimates of Improved Thermal Conductivity Values</ITAG>WCI stated that the Department's analysis of improved insulations goes``far beyond anything we believe will be available.'' (WCI, No. 78, at6). Specifically, WCI argued that the assumption that .11 and .10 K valuescan be achieved with MDI foam is not valid.In response, the Department notes that GE testified that it presently achievesa K value equal to 0.11. (GE, Testimony, January 12, 1989). Since a K valueequal to 0.11 is available now, the Department has no reason to believethat it will not still be available in 1993, when this rule will be ineffect. On the other hand, because of the expected product development,e.g., drying, rigidity, and other implementation issues, that the Departmentexpects will be needed to achieve the availability of .10 foam, DOE agreeswith WCI that such foam is not likely to be available, in necessary quantities,in 1993. Therefore, in its analysis for this final rule, the Departmentlimited its consideration of a maximum improvement in thermal conductivityvalue to 0.11.<ITAG tagnum="84">Substitution of Foam Insulation for Fiberglass</ITAG>In the proposed rule, the Department reported that it had estimated a 12percent reduction in energy-use as a result of substituting foam for fiberglassunder the lid of a chest freezer. WCI argued, however, that when it madea similar substitution, there were zero energy savings. (WCI, No. 78, at5).The Department's estimate of energy savings from foaming the lid of a chestfreezer was obtained from an analysis of K factors for fiberglass and foaminsulation. With the area and temperature difference being equal, the Departmentbelieves that the superior K factor of foam should provide a noticeablesavings.Furthermore, even assuming a penalty for the replacement of CFC-11, theDepartment estimated that foaming the lid of a chest freezer would stillresult in an 8.6 percent reduction in energy-use for this design option.In addition, the substitution of foam for fiberglass should provide superiorinsulating qualities, at least theoretically, and, therefore, provide someenergy savings. Empirically, such substitutions have produced energy savingsin other refrigeration applications. The Department, therefore, does notunderstand why WCI's substitution of foam for fiberglass in a chest freezerlid produced no energy savings.<ITAG tagnum="84">Energy Savings With the 5.0 EER Compressor</ITAG>In the proposed rule, the Department reported that its energy model predictedan 11.2 percent energy reduction when a 5.0 EER compressor was substitutedfor a 4.5 EER compressor in the case of an 18 cubic foot, top-mount, automaticdefrost refrigerator-freezer. Admiral, however, commented that its simulationmodel ``predicts a 7.1 percent energy reduction for the same change.''(Admiral, No. 123, at 7).The Department's simulations modeled actual compressors with data suppliedby compressor manufacturers. The 5.0 EER compressor that was modeled wasactually a 5.05 EER compressor at the standard rating conditions (130anddegrees;Fcondensing temperature and ^10anddegrees;F evaporator temperature). The Departmenthas changed its designation of the 5.0 EER compressor to a 5.05 EER compressorin the substitute CFC analysis. The 4.5 EER compressor is actually a 4.3EER compressor at the rating point. If both compressors operated at thesame standard conditions, the efficiency improvement for the refrigerationsystem would be (5.05^4.3)/4.3=17.4 percent. The energy reduction, (assumingno auxiliary electric energy use) would be 14.8 percent. However, sinceonly about 75 percent of the total energy use for the top-mount automaticdefrost refrigerator-freezer is for the compressor, the efficiency improvementwould be only 11.1 percent (.75 (14.8 percent)). Therefore, if the evaporatorand condenser temperatures were at ^10anddegrees;F and 130anddegrees;F, respectively,11.1 percent would be the expected energy savings. The Department had an11.2 percent energy savings. It should be noted that the simulation modelsolves iteratively for the condenser and evaporator temperatures. Therefore,the actual compressor EER is rarely equal to the nominal value.<ITAG tagnum="84">Baseline Model</ITAG>A number of comments claimed that the baseline models are inaccurate; thatis, they do not properly represent the features of average models to besold in 1990. These comments also stated that the average unit representedby the shipment-weighted energy factor (SWEF) would be substantially higher,i.e., more efficient, than the 1990 standard. (AHAM, No. 137, at 3 and16; GE, No. 125, at 22-24. Battelle, No. 110, at 1, and Testimony, January13, 1989; and Admiral, No. 123, at 7).In response, the Department notes that the purpose of the baseline modelsis to provide a basis for estimating changes in unit energy consumptionand production costs associated with implementing engineering design changes.The baseline models in the analysis for today's final rule are generallyrepresentative of units that marginally comply with the 1990 standard.In the proposed rule, DOE stated that the baseline models for refrigerators,refrigerator-freezers, and freezers ``represent a typical model withinan appliance class that will be sold during 1990, the year NAECA standardsfirst take effect.''The Department's baseline unit contained designs that were meant to representonly one combination that can be used to meet the 1990 standard. The baselinedescription should not be interpreted as being unique. Indeed, there aremany ways to achieve a particular energy-use. The baselines that were chosenrepresent one set of descriptions for units close to the 1990 standards.Where the baseline consumption was greater than the expected 1993 SWEF,an adjusted baseline (from the cost-efficiency curve) was established withwhich to calculate economic quantities such as payback periods. The Departmentbelieves that it is reasonable to expect that the baseline unit shouldhave characteristics that are similar to marginally compliant units thatwill be produced in 1990. The Department believes that recent manufacturerdata submitted to the Department by Battelle show that objective was accomplished.(Battelle, No. 110).The Department has responded to Battelle's comment by adding a point inthe engineering analysis' cost-efficiency curves that reflects the BEM,and has used that information in the LBL-REM. This point was used as the1990 SWEF, from which calculations of energy savings were made. In addition,its use in the LBL-REM influenced the other parts of the analysis thatuse LBL-REM output as input, e.g., the LBL-MIM, environmental analysispayback calculations.In selecting a baseline unit, the Department chose units that had adjustedvolumes that are representative of the different models sold. Commentsthat the baselines chosen had adjusted volumes that differed from the industryaverages, which were provided by Battelle, are not relevant. That is becauseenergy standards are not in terms of a single maximum allowable energyconsumption regardless of size, but, rather, the standards are equationsthat relate energy-use to adjusted volume. Therefore, differently sizedunits of the same class have different maximum allowable levels of energyconsumption.According to data submitted by Battelle, in many cases, the industry hasplanned design changes to meet the 1990 standards which differ from thosecharacterized by the DOE baseline model. DOE recognizes the diverse methodsby which industry can meet the 1990 standards, and is not implying thata specific design will be adopted by all manufacturers. For some classes,the DOE baseline units do not meet the 1990 standards. In those classes,a design option is identifiable which will meet the 1990 standard. DOEassumes that the most cost-effective designs will be incorporated first.<ITAG tagnum="84">Compressor Efficiencies for Smaller Capacity Units</ITAG>WCI contended that the proposed rule failed ``to take into account thevery important difference that size makes in compressor efficiency.'' (WCI,No. 78, at 5).Specifically, WCI pointed out that in smaller refrigerators, the correspondinglysmaller compressors are less energy-efficient.This point was also raised at the hearing in testimony offered by Mr. Hardtof the Embraco Corporation. (Hardt, Testimony, January 12, 1989).After extensive review of the subject, the Department agrees with WCI'sand Embraco's contention. As a result, the analysis for this rulemakinglimited its evaluation of the maximum feasible compressor efficiency to4.0 EER for the very small refrigerator-freezers. This consideration wasapplied only to the manual defrost refrigerator class, since that is theclass in which virtually all of the relevant smaller units fall.<ITAG tagnum="84">Accuracy of the Simulation Model</ITAG>GE stated that ``using the simulation program that GE normally uses fordesign guidance, the results showed the baseline model would use 1016 kWh/yr.,compared with 947 kWh/yr. as shown in the TSD.'' (GE, No. 125, at 21).In response, the Department notes that it is difficult to compare two simulationprograms without knowing all the details about them. However, there isa very important difference between GE's baseline unit and DOE's. The Department'sdescription of the schematic drawing of its baseline in Appendix A of theproposed rule's Technical Support Document was in error. It describes a20 ft3, rather than an 18.0 ft3, top-mount automatic defrost refrigerator-freezer.The simulations were done for an 18.0 ft3 unit as described in the proposedrule. The Department, however, placed the wrong schematic in the appendix.Therefore, GE would be expected to obtain a higher energy consumption forits baseline than the Department did. The adjusted volume for the unitpictured in Appendix A is actually 23.4 ft3 rather than 20.8, a 2.6 ft3increase over the baseline adjusted volume. DOE believes that the differencein adjusted volume accounts for the higher energy use of GE's baselineunit.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Several Refrigerator Design Options</ITAG>Several comments contended that the Department had failed to analyze properlyseveral significant design options. These included dual compressor units;two-stage, two-evaporator systems; hybrid evaporators; variable-speed compressors;and, silica aerogel insulation. (American Council for an Energy-EfficiencyEconomy (ACEEE), ACEEE, No. 77, at 1-4; NRDC, No. 81, at 38-55; NYSEO,No. 156, at 125; CEC, No. 108, at 10; and RMI, No. 49, at 3-5). Each ofthese will be discussed.There are at least three variants of two-evaporator systems. These arethe two-stage, two-evaporator system, e.g., the LaBrecque cycle; the two-compressor,two-evaporator system; and the hybrid evaporator system. The energy savingsarise by having the refrigerator evaporator operate at a higher (about20 anddegrees;F) temperature than the freezer evaporator (about ^13 anddegrees;F).A reduction in defrost energy is also possible since there is less condensationof moisture from food in the refrigerator at the higher evaporator temperature.Food will also keep longer because it will not get as dehydrated.The two-stage, two-evaporator LaBrecque cycle refrigerator-freezer is beingdeveloped. Theoretical estimates are that this design can save 20-25 percentof compressor energy currently consumed.The hybrid evaporator is a two-evaporator system with one compressor. Avalve controls the flow of refrigerant to the two evaporators. Two companieshave commented that it did not perform well. Amana stated that ``variationsin the temperatures had a marked effect on the compressor cycling patternand on thermal performance of the unit.'' (Amana, Testimony, January 13,1989).The two-compressor, two-evaporator system received much attention in thecomments (ACEEE, No. 77, at 3; RMI, No. 49, at 4; NRDC, No. 81, at 49-53).These comments identified the Norgard prototype as a low energy prototypethat uses this technology. It must be noted that the Norgard prototypealso uses thicker insulation than is normal for similarly sized U.S. refrigerator-freezers.There are no anti-sweat heaters and no condenser fan. The Norgard paper\16\<NOTE/> estimates about 20 percent energy savings for the refrigerationsystem. Using the Norgard equations and the Department's data results ina 17 percent energy savings for the compressor. Norgard does not providedata on the compressor EERs or additional cost for the refrigeration system.One comment stated that the Norgard prototype can be built for $150-$200more than conventional models, and the price premium would fall with increasedproduction. (RMI, No. 49, at 4). This price increase is supposed to coverall changes in the prototype relative to the conventional model. Two-compressor,two-evaporator system models are built by Sub-Zero in the U.S. and by Boschin Germany.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ Per Henrik Pedersen, Jorgen Schjaer-Jacobsen, and JorgenS. Norgard, <T3>Reducing Electricity Consumption in American Type Combined Refrigerator/freezer</T3>,paper presented at 37th Annual International Appliance Technical Conference,Purdue University, May 6-7, 1986.After analyzing the three different two-evaporator systems, the Departmenthas added such a design option to the analysis. DOE selected the two-evaporator,two-compressor system for the analysis.The Department attempted to obtain data on variable-speed compressors fromrefrigerator and compressor manufacturers, but was unable to. In the future,manufacturers may go to this technology to match loads better to compressorcapacity. This will reduce cycling losses and allow for higher evaporatortemperatures in the refrigerator compartment. The cost of such a systemand the performance are not yet known. This design could eventually beconsidered as another alternative for the two-evaporator system; that is,a variable-speed compressor could operate with an electronically controlledvalve and two evaporators to supply refrigerant to the cabinet that requiresit.Since the Department's original analysis, aerogel insulation has been moreseriously considered as a replacement for foam insulation in refrigeratorsand freezers. A prototype is being constructed by a manufacturer in concertwith Quantum Optics, Inc. (Quantum) (Quantum, Testimony, January 12, 1989).DOE performed some analysis of this design option, e.g., the developmentof cost-efficiency data, but chose instead to let powder-filled panelsbe the representative for evacuated panel insulation. Powder-filled evacuatedpanels have been used in some refrigerators marketed in the United States,and the Department believes that the data on their cost and performancecharacteristics are more reliable for use in modeling the energy-conservingpossibilities of evacuated panels.Two comments argued that the Department's analysis was insufficient intreating alternative refrigerants, condenser gas heating, and improvedgaskets. (NRDC, No. 81, at 44-55; and CEC, No. 108, at 10).Improved gaskets reduce heat leakage and thus reduce compressor energyuse. This can be done by improving single gasket designs or changing toa double gasket design. NRDC commented that improved single gaskets shouldbe considered. (NRDC, No. 81, at 57). The Department's proposed rule assumeda 10 percent improvement in gasket heat leakage for its baseline models.The Department does not see that further improvements can be made. Therefore,for the final rule, the Department continued to assume a 10 percent improvementin gasket heat leakage for the baseline models.Since the proposed rule was prepared, new research has been performed onalternative refrigerants. Alternatives, such as HFC-134a and HCFC-22, andmixtures have been considered. The former will not provide an efficiencyas high as that of CFC-12, although both HFC-134a has the advantage ofno ozone depleting potential (ODP) and HCFC-22 a much lower ODP than thatof CFC-12. For mixtures, such as CFC-12 and DME, preliminary Oak RidgeNational Laboratory (ORNL) data show an improvement in efficiency relativeto that of CFC-12 alone. However, the work at ORNL is only preliminaryand more testing is necessary. The Dupont mixture, consisting of HCFCs-22and  -124, and HFC-152a, is reported to be approximately equal to CFC-12in efficiency. The new blend is reported to be a drop-in, and oil compatibilityis not reported to be a problem. The ODP is very low (0.03) relative toCFC-12 (1.0). Toxicity testing is needed for HCFC-124. Only limited commercialquantities could be provided before 1993-94 (Dupont, No. 113, at 2).Two comments contended that substitution of condenser gas heating for anti-sweatheaters around the doors of refrigerators and freezers will save energybecause the electric energy use of the heaters is saved. (NRDC, No. 81,at 56; and RMI, No. 49, at 5). This is a controversial issue. It is notclear if the heat flowing into the cabinets due to the increased wall temperaturewould be greater than that provided by the electric heaters. Since anyadditional internal heat would have to be removed by the refrigerationsystem, condenser gas heating may not be more energy efficient than electricanti-sweat heating. One participant at the hearing stated that it is unclearwhether using condenser gas heating saves energy. (Sub-Zero Freezer Company,Inc. (Sub-Zero), Testimony, January 12, 1989).NRDC assumes that condenser gas heating will save energy because most ofthe heat energy will flow outwards (due to the higher R-value of the walls).However, DOE believes this may not occur since the wall temperature maystill be higher than without condenser gas heating. Therefore, DOE rejectscondenser gas heating as an energy saving design.<ITAG tagnum="84">Natural Convection in Lieu of Fans</ITAG>RMI commented that the Department should have included the use of naturalconvection currents instead of fans in some situations. (RMI, No. 49, at5).The Department notes that it may be possible to remove fans in a two-evaporatordesign where air need not be circulated from the freezer to the refrigeratorcompartment. The Norgard design uses one fan in the freezer compartment,and none in the refrigerator cabinet. Sub-Zero's design, on the other hand,uses fans in each cabinet.Where two-evaporator systems were studied, the Department's analysis includeda four watt evaporator fan in the freezer compartment, and no fan in therefrigerator compartment. By modeling this design, which is similar tothe Norgard one, the Department's analysis does address the savings potentialof natural convection currents.<ITAG tagnum="84">Inclusion of Enhanced Heat Transfer for Evaporators</ITAG>Two comments stated that DOE should have included in its analysis enhancedheat transfer for evaporators. Heat exchanger heat transfer can be improvedby increased area, increased air flow over the refrigerant tubes or otherheat transfer enhancement. (ACEEE, No. 77, at 4; and CEC, at 10). All ofthese approaches allow the evaporator temperature to be increased, whichresults in less compressor energy use. Heat exchanger area can be increasedby increasing face area or adding more rows of refrigerant tubes. Increasedarea will result in increased evaporator heat transfer effectiveness. Increasingthe volume occupied by the heat exchanger will reduce the internal volumesince evaporators are located inside the cabinets. Simulations with thetop-mount, automatic defrost refrigerator-freezer indicate that an increasein evaporator  ``heat transfer-area product'' of 10 percent will resultin a 1.1 percent energy use decrease.DOE added this design option to the analysis.Another alternative is to add fins or redesign the fins so as to increasethe rate of heat transfer. For example, the amount of material used inthe fins could be kept constant while changing the shape of the fins, andpossibly increasing their density. Alternate materials could be used thathave higher rates of heat transfer to the surrounding air. The heat transferon the interior of the heat exchanger tubes can also be enhanced by addinggrooves or other modifications. Data provided by coil manufacturers tothe Department indicate that an energy savings of 1.5-2.0 percent is possiblefor enhanced evaporator heat transfer for an additional cost of $1.225million (all tooling and expenses, covering all applicable refrigeratorand freezer classes). Although there is no confirmation of this cost estimate,DOE has converted this tooling cost into a per unit cost.The ACEEE further stated that a paper by Mr. Bohman of Amana discussesthe potential savings with improved evaporator heat transfer. In that paper,an example was given where the uA value \17\<NOTE/> for the evaporator is increased from 65 to 113, and the compressorcan operate at ^10 anddegrees;F rather than ^15 anddegrees;F. This resultsin an energy savings of 7.5 percent for a 74 percent increase in heat transfereffectiveness. This is similar to the simulation results cited above. Theanalysis is over-simplified since space limitations and other factors muststill be considered. Costs of such an improvement were not provided inany comments received. Therefore, DOE is using the data that was used previouslyto estimate energy savings and costs for enhanced evaporator heat transfer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ uA is the engineering factor for heat transfer-area usuallygiven in units of Btus/hr/anddegrees;F.<ITAG tagnum="84">Improved Expansion Valves and Fluid Control Valves</ITAG>One comment states that data should be gathered on improved expansion valvesand fluid control valves, since fluid control valves could be used to reduceoff-cycle refrigerant movement. (CEC, No. 108, at 10). Fluid control valveswould cause a compressor to start against an unequalized pressure condition.This has been accomplished for rotary, but not for reciprocating compressors.Fluid control valves have not been effective with reciprocating compressors;and, it was reciprocating compressors that the Department simulated inits analysis. Therefore, the Department has not modeled any energy savingsfrom the use of fluid control valves with reciprocating compressors.Although DOE has comments requesting an evaluation of improved expansionvalves, no new data have been forthcoming. As stated in the proposed rule,it is expected that some energy savings would be possible from this designoption in the non steady-state mode. Another complication is that the testprocedure may not be suitable to demonstrate the savings from this designoption. Additional information from the laboratory as well as in-use dataare needed to evaluate this design accurately.There were no new data submitted on either of these design options.B. <T3>Consumer Analysis:</T3> The comments on the consumer analysis of refrigeratorsdealt with a number of issues including the baseline models and efficienciesfor 1990 and the Department's projections of no improvement in energy useand efficiency levels for refrigerators.<ITAG tagnum="84">Energy Use Projections</ITAG>Battelle submitted data that support the energy consumption estimates thathad been attributed to specific designs by the Department. These data indicatethat manufacturers plan to exceed the 1990 standards. Battelle did notcriticize the costs associated with the design options.DOE continues to calculate energy savings and net present value of proposedstandards by comparing the trial standards cases to the base case, whichincludes the 1990 standards. DOE welcomes the AHAM data submitted by Battelle,since it is useful for calibrating the base case in 1990, as noted above.Based on revisions to the engineering data and modeling inputs, e.g., energyprice projections and heat pump shipments, the Department has calculateda new projection of efficiencies for refrigerators. These revised projectionsare reported in the Technical Support Document accompanying today's finalrule. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Appendices A and B.NYSEO criticized the Department's questioning of its own projection that,in the absence of more stringent refrigerator standards, no improvementin refrigerator efficiency would be likely. NYSEO characterized the Department'sstatement as a ``turnaround'' for which DOE had provided no justification.(NYSEO, No. 156, at 20).While the Department believes that conservation improvements in refrigeratorswill occur, nevertheless, the analysis for the final rule continues toproject that in the absence of more stringent standards, there would beno improvement in refrigerator energy efficiency. The Department continuesto question the LBL-REM's forecast of no improvement in SWEF over the analysisperiod (1993-2015). The Department finds that the improvement in efficiencywhich has occurred and the improvements that are possible, as shown inthe engineering analysis, make it highly unlikely that, on average, therewill be no improvement in refrigerator efficiency over the next 25 years.<ITAG tagnum="84">Shipments</ITAG>One comment on the proposed rule suggested that the Department's projectionsof refrigerator shipments under the different standards cases were toohigh. (Battelle, No. 110, at 2, 23). Battelle not only does not expectshipments to increase in the standards cases, as DOE had projected in theproposed rule, but expects instead that shipments would decline under standards,at least in the short term. (Battelle, No. 110, at 21).DOE agrees with comments raised by Battelle.DOE obtained the results of increasing shipments in the standards' casesprimarily because of the operating expense elasticities in the LBL-REM,which were based on a cross-sectional analysis that was done in 1976. Inresponse to Battelle's comments, the Department has revised, but not eliminated,operating expense elasticities, in order to prevent refrigerator salesfrom increasing in the standards' cases. Values of the operating cost elasticitiesfor refrigerators and for freezers are presented in the Technical SupportDocument.Battelle also contended that ``consumers switching to efficient modelsonly steal sales from inefficient models.'' (Battelle, No. 110, at 22).The Department believes that this view is unsupported. Although effectivelyall households in the U.S. now own a refrigerator, the saturation did notstop at 100 percent. In fact, many households now own two, and in somecases three, refrigerators. If the operating expense of an appliance decreases,it could become more attractive to a larger population.<ITAG tagnum="84">Maintenance Expenses</ITAG>Another critique of the consumer analysis of refrigerators was that theDepartment did not include additional maintenance expenses that would beassociated with more efficient refrigerator designs. Battelle suggested,in fact, that more efficient designs impose an incremental maintenanceexpense equal to five percent of the incremental price. (Battelle, No.110, at 16). In addition, while not suggesting a specific amount, GE alsocomplained that the economic analysis that was reported in the proposedrule did not consider maintenance expenses. (GE, No. 125, at 34).In the proposed rule, DOE assumed that there would be no incremental maintenanceexpenses for the refrigerator, refrigerator-freezer, and freezer designoptions considered. The Department does not believe that incremental maintenanceexpenses are accurately represented by simply taking five percent of theincremental price as proposed by Battelle. The information presented isinsufficient to justify including such expenses as proportional to equipmentprices. In addition, the Department does not believe that the designs underconsideration, e.g., more efficient compressors and improved gaskets, wouldbe sufficiently different in design from their less energy-conserving counterpartsthat their estimated reliability should be lower. The Department, therefore,continued to assume no incremental maintenance expenses in its analysisfor the final rule.C. <T3>Manufacturer Analysis:</T3> The comments on the proposed rule's analysisof impacts on refrigerator manufacturers dealt with four areas: the markupsused in the analysis; profitability questions; the discount rate from themanufacturers' perspective; and, the ``worst case'' refrigerator sensitivityscenario. Each of these are discussed, below:<ITAG tagnum="84">Markup</ITAG>CEC and NRDC argued that the constant markup assumption in the manufacturers'impact model (LBL-MIM) was unrealistically high, and they requested documentationof its origin. (CEC, No. 108, at 14-16; and NRDC, No. 81, at 111-113).The Department notes that the Manufacturer Analysis uses a manufacturermarkup, which varies with the product class, and a retail markup whichis constant. To arrive at the retail price, the manufacturer's cost ismultiplied by the manufacturer markup and the retail markup.The LBL-MIM computes a set of manufacturer markups based on estimates ofthe average markup and the ratio of the highest to the lowest markup, andon the assumption that markup is linearly related to the price of the applianceclass, that is, the greater the price, the greater the markup that is containedwithin that price. These three pieces of information completely definethe manufacturer markup for each appliance class.The first use of these markups is to estimate the unit variable cost inthe calibration, or present-day, case. This is done by taking the retailprices for calibration-case appliance models, and dividing, first, by aconstant retail markup, and then by the manufacturer markup for the appropriateclass.The central economic calculations of the LBL-MIM (found in the long-runmodule) divides the cost of a baseline (calibration) unit into fixed andvariable components. It is assumed that fixed costs cannot be marked up,but that variable costs are. From this assumption, a markup for variablecost is computed; this markup reproduces the estimate of the industry'saverage ROE. This markup is then applied to the long-run variable costcomponent of all cost increases, and is constant over all design options.At this stage of the model, classes are not considered.The manufacturer analysis is based on manufacturer price, which is calculatedas just described. In addition, one final calculation using markups ismade for the benefit of other parts of the analysis. That is the calculationof retail prices for the individual classes. This begins with the manufacturingprice in the calibration case, and adds to this the change in long-runvariable cost times the manufacturer markup for the particular class underconsideration. (This is the markup described above; it varies from classto class.) These new prices are then all multiplied by a factor (near onein value) which is designed to ensure that the average price, when computedby weighing all classes by their shipments, is the same as the price thatis computed by the long-run module, and is used in the LBL-MIM analysis.The comments requested documentation to validate these markups. There areno ``real market data'' on markups at either the manufacturer or retaillevel, since these data are highly confidential. The manufacturer markupsused in the analysis were developed for the proposed rule from data andinformation collected from refrigerator manufacturers.The retail markup is an average retail markup that covers a range of actualmarkups and it is not meant to represent any one type of retail distributionchannel. NRDC asserts that the retail markup will decrease rather thanstay constant as standards impose a higher first cost of refrigerators.(NRDC, No. 81, at 111). However, NRDC does not provide any data to supportits claim or to show how much the markup should decrease. There is no reasonto believe that retailers will not mark up cost increases induced by standards.The Department did not use any data to arrive at the constantness of theretail markup assumption, because no data exist, but believes that assumptionis more plausible than any alternative.<ITAG tagnum="84">Profitability</ITAG>The questions about refrigerator manufacturers' profitability involvedprojections about profitability in the short- and long-run, as well asthe projected differences in forecasted profitability under five standardscases.In commenting on the likely short-run profitability results, Battelle stated,``the cost increases that will accompany more stringent standards willnot be fully recovered or immediately reflected in higher prices, resultingin lower profits and returns in the short run.'' (Battelle, No. 110, at22).In response, it must be noted that if standards lead to a decrease in shipments,the LBL-MIM does predict a short-run fall in profits. LBL-MIM predicts,however, that there will not be a decline in shipments or profits in theshort run for refrigerator manufacturers. Nevertheless, the dynamic processof adapting to a new situation_the process of reaching a new equilibriumof demand and supply_is difficult to model. It is difficult to predictwhat production, marketing, and pricing strategies different manufacturerswould choose in adapting to more stringent standards, and it is possiblethat some manufacturers would make choices that would result in lower profitsin the short run until they learn how to operate in the new environment.On the issue of long-run profitability, Battelle contends that, under revisedstandards, refrigerator and freezer shipments will decrease rather thanincrease (as the Department had projected in the proposed rule), and, therefore,profits will decrease. In addition, for any chance for profits to increase,shipments would need to increase. (Battelle, No. 110, at 22). The Departmentof Justice (DOJ) also questions the conclusion that the proposed refrigeratorstandards could increase profits. (DOJ, No. 162, at 4).The Department notes that for improved profitability, it is not necessaryfor shipments to increase under revised standards. If a manufacturer sellsfewer units that are higher priced or that have higher profit margins,it is possible that profits would increase.Battelle does state that ``because cost increases cannot be passed on,immediately or completely in this price competitive market, profits andROE (return-on-equity) cannot increase.'' (Battelle, No. 110, at 22).In response, the Department questions the inevitability of this result,since Battelle gives no data to support the assertion that costs cannotbe passed on completely, nor to what extent they can be passed on. Observationof the marketplace strongly supports the view that increases in variablecosts generally are passed on, often with a markup. No single manufacturercould independently make substantially more efficient machines and expectan increase in his profitability, because his product's purchase pricewould be higher to the consumer than would his competitor's less-efficientproduct. Because of that manufacturer's higher prices, and the fact thatthe average consumer does not consider life-cycle expenses, that manufacturer,by acting alone to produce a more energy-efficient appliance, would likelyexperience declines in profitability and ROE. However, standards are likelyto raise the production costs of major refrigerator manufacturers similarly,thereby increasing the likelihood that costs can be passed on in the formof higher consumer prices for refrigerators. Furthermore, the extent towhich costs are passed on is determined by the proportion that is variableas opposed to fixed, as discussed under markup above.In urging support for standard level 4, the Oregon Department of Energy(ODE) contended that ``level 4 results in a more positive economic impacton manufacturers than level 3.'' (ODE, No. 83, at 2).The Department notes that the ODE did not describe what criteria it wasusing for ``positive economic impact;'' from the analytical results insupport of the proposed rule, however, the Department consistently usedROE as the normal measure of impact, and ROE was reported to be 0.03 percentagepoint lower at standard level 4 than at standard level 3.<ITAG tagnum="84">Manufacturers' discount rate</ITAG>Battelle asserts that ``From the manufacturers' perspective, use of a 7percent real discount rate is also unsupportable'' for a manufacturer analysis.(Battelle, No. 110, at 33). Battelle's concern appears to be that the correctdiscount rate be used in estimating the economic impacts of energy conservationstandards on manufacturers.In response, the Department notes that the LBL-MIM used a real interestrate of six percent in modeling the interest rate paid for debt incurredby the firm. This figure was reported on pages C-45 and C-59 of the proposedrule's Technical Support Document. Battelle concurs with using this interestrate for this part of a manufacturer's operations. (Battelle, No. 110,at 33).LBL-MIM uses the firm's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) (whichincludes both return-on-equity and return on debt) in analyzing the impactsof additional investments induced by standards, and LBL-MIM uses a WACCrate of 12.1 percent for refrigerator manufacturers (See proposed ruleTSD, p. C-59). Battelle uses ROE for the manufacturers discount rate. AlthoughWACC is a different measure from ROE, the rate that is used is similarto what Battelle suggests the analysis should use: ``Based on our knowledgeand experience, an industry like the refrigerator/freezer industry wouldlikely require a return-on-equity between 10 and 20 percent, though probablyin the mid to lower half of this range * * * *'' (Battelle, No. 110, at33).Thus, it seems that Battelle's disagreement with the discount rate usedin the Manufacturers Analysis is a result of misunderstanding what numbersare used in what portions of LBL-MIM.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sensitivity Analysis</ITAG>The NRDC commented that the refrigerator sensitivity analysis that wasused in a ``worst case'' scenario, which consisted of a low consumer operatingexpense elasticity, was implausible and should not be used. (NRDC, No.81, at 113-117).In response, the Department notes that the NRDC correctly states that ifthe operating cost elasticity is zero, ``consumers pay no attention whateverto operating costs,'' but then incorrectly concludes that ``market forceswill never save a single kilowatt-hour of energy consumption in refrigerators,but instead that standards will be and have been responsible for 100 percentof the efficiency improvement that can ever take place.'' (NRDC, No. 81,at 113-114). In fact, increased efficiency is often the by-product of technologicalchange driven by very different market forces. DOE does not believe thatall scenarios are possible. This one is offered as a way of providing afirm bound on the estimated values. The Department agrees with NRDC thata zero operating cost elasticity is highly improbable, but lacks the datato estimate that probability.NRDC also states that even if consumers are totally unresponsive to savingsin operating costs, there will still be an operating cost elasticity, becauseconsumers are saving money on operating expenses, and thus will buy morerefrigerators. This is referred to as the ``income effect,'' which, theDepartment believes, would be small in this case because: (1) The operatingcost savings in any one year are extremely small relative to a consumer'sincome; and, (2) the consumer is not restricted to buying appliances withthe money saved_he or she can spend it in any way desired.Regarding the industry price elasticity, the Department agrees with NRDC'sanalysis that the data showing a price elasticity of ^1 are improbable.That price elasticity was used, however, only in the sensitivity analysis.Sensitivity analyses are meant to help set upper and lower bounds on theresults of an analysis, and as such are supposed to be unlikely. Thus,the Department believes that its choices of industry price elasticity andoperating cost elasticity for the sensitivity analysis are good choices.2. Comments on Small Furnace Analysis<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Engineering Analysis</ITAG>The engineering comments related to the energy use of an induced draftfan, the space required for induced draft fans in narrow units, low maintenancecosts, and low installation costs. Each of these will be addressed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Energy Use</ITAG>Lone Star Gas (LSG) correctly states that DOE did not include the costof electricity to operate the induced draft fan motor in a 78 percent AFUEsmall gas furnace. (LSG, No. 130, at 9).The Department has not included electrical consumption in the determinationof AFUE for any gas or oil furnaces. However, as furnaces have become moresophisticated with items such as induced draft fans, to include electricityconsumption in the determination of AFUE has become a growing concern.While the AFUE calculation for small gas furnaces does not include anyfan energy consumption, the Department did include, in the analysis forthe final rule, an operating cost for a 50W electric power demand for theinduced draft fan in the 78 percent AFUE small gas furnace.<ITAG tagnum="84">Size</ITAG>Energen and Alabama Gas Corporation (Eandamp;AGC) state that induced draftfan designs are currently not available in the narrow sizes (10.5andmin16;andmin16;-12.25andmin16;andmin16;)that are often used in multifamily housing. (Eandamp;AGC, No. 82, at 4).Presently designed induced draft units may not fit some of the narrowestspaces now being used. DOE believes that there are no technical reasons,however, to preclude the design of narrower induced draft fan units. Itis difficult for DOE to predict exactly what new models will look likebut the Department does not believe that the compact, narrow furnace marketwill be abandoned. Additionally, some of the relatively new gas units thatcombine water and space heating in one unit may be appropriate where compactnessis required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Maintenance Costs</ITAG>LSG and Southern Gas Association (SGA) state that DOE maintenance costsare too low and that DOE should include the cost of replacing a circuitboard which, they claim, is likely to fail during the life of a small gasfurnace. (LSG, No. 130, at 7; and SGA, No. 51, at 6).DOE does not consider the control electronics for the induced draft unitto be basically any more complex than for the IID design required for the71 percent AFUE furnace. There are only simple controls such as thermostats,sensors and switches to test for air flow. The Department does not expectany increased circuit board maintenance costs for the induced draft furnacerelative to the 71 percent AFUE design and, therefore, the maintenace costshave not been changed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Installation Costs</ITAG>A number of gas supply companies stated that increased installation costswould result from the replacement of old furnaces with 78 percent AFUEinduced draft furnaces, because of venting modifications to accommodateatmospheric gas water heaters. LSG estimated an increase of $60-$150. (LSG,No. 30, at 6). SGA estimated an increase of $0-$400 with an average of$175. (SGA, No. 51, at 5). Florida Natural Gas Association (FNG) estimatedan increase of $200. (FNG, No. 115, at 3). AGA projected an unspecifiedincreased cost. (AGA, No. 128, at 13).Common venting of induced draft gas furnaces and atmospheric water heatersis a complex issue. Building codes vary throughout the nation and mostlocalities may require some modifications to common venting systems, includingprohibiting them. Such modifications would be expected to cause some increasein installation cost. The costs would fall most heavily on replacementfurnaces in multifamily buildings, since changes from current venting practicescan be accounted for in designs for new construction and single familyunits, where venting can often be done directly through the sidewall. DOEdoes not have any data that provides an estimate of how frequently additionalinstallation costs would be incurred. To account for these increased costs,the final rule included a $200 estimated extra installation cost for allreplacement furnaces in multifamily units.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Consumer Analysis</ITAG>There were comments on many consumer issues dealing with small gas furnaces.These included end-use specific gas prices, conversion expenses, fuel-switching,oversizing factors, rebound effects, maintenance expenses, heat pump shipments,fan energy consumption, calculations of AFUE, and the furnace-water heatingfuel linkage. Each of these will be addressed.<ITAG tagnum="84">End-Use Gas Price</ITAG>Enserch Corporation (Enserch) commented that for the Department to employend-use specific electricity prices for the analysis of those appliancesthat consume electricity, and not to employ end-use specific natural gasprices for the small furnace analysis is both ``illogical and erroneous.''(Enserch, No. 51, at 8).In response, the Department notes that while it agrees in principle withusing end-use specific energy prices for natural gas in the small furnaceanalysis, neither the Energy Information Administration, nor the AGA (inits Home Househeating Survey) collects direct information on natural gasprices by end-use consumption.The Department does not believe, therefore, that the price of natural gasthat is utilized by small gas furnaces can be determined from any existingdata base. Therefore, DOE continued to assume that the price of naturalgas for small gas furnaces was the average residential price of naturalgas.<ITAG tagnum="84">Shift to Electric Resistance Heating</ITAG>The Act required that the Department analyze the extent to which the pricesassociated with conservation standards on small gas furnaces could causeconsumers to switch from natural gas to electric resistance heat. In theanalysis for the proposed rule, the Department did not account for anyadditional consumer expense in undertaking such a switch. This assumptionwas criticized by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and by the AmericanElectric Power System and Southern Company (AEPSSC). (EEI, No. 127, at6-7; and AEPSSC, No. 136, at 10). EEI stated that this expense would notbe insignificant. According to the 1988 edition of ``Means Electrical CostData,'' EEI reported that to upgrade a home with electrical service capacityof 60 amperes to 200 amperes would cost the consumer $860. Even to upgradeto 150 ampere service, EEI reported, would cost the consumer $715. (EEI,No. 127, at 6). In response, the Department included, in the LBL-REM modeling runs forthis final rule, expenses that could be involved in the replacement marketto convert from gas heat to electric heat.A number of comments were received concerning the Department's belief thata 78 percent AFUE standard on small gas furnaces would not result in asignificant shift to electric resistance heating. The Department proposedthis conclusion as a result of its estimation of expected market sharesfrom LBL-REM. In Table 5.20 of the proposed rule's Technical Support Document,the Department had estimated that a 78 percent AFUE standard or small gasfurnaces would not lead to a shift to electric resistance heat. The analysisprojects that standards would lead to an increase in small gas furnaceshipments, compared to the base case, over the 1992-2015 time period. Thisincrease was expected to come at the expense of larger gas furnaces andelectric heat pumps. A similar shift is found in this final rule. The small gas furnace methodology is based on historical data on spaceheating choices in new homes from 1976-79. In addition, the method effectivelyassumes that the elasticities are a function of climate, energy prices,and other variables, and are not constant. As a result, the Department is confident in its analysis of market shares.Nevertheless, numerous comments suggested that a 78 percent AFUE standardon small gas furnace would lead to initial price increases, the resultof which would be a significant shift to electric resistance heat, especiallyin new construction where, it is argued, builders, who are concerned primarilywith the initial purchase price, make the purchase decision. Among thosepresenting these conclusions were Southern Gas Company (SGC) (SGC, No.51, at 3 and 9); Atlantic Gas Light Company (AGLC) (AGLC, No. 70, at 1);Mobile Gas Service Company (MGSC) (MGSC, No. 72, at 2); Hope Gas, Inc.(HGI, No. 112, at 2); Florida Natural Gas Association (FNGA) (FNGA, No.115, at 3); Laclede Gas Company (LGC) (LGC, No. 121, at 2-5); AGA (AGA,No. 128, at 6 and 12); Southern California Gas Company (SCGC, No. 134,at 2 and 6); and ENTEX and Arkansas Louisiana Gas (ENTEX) (ENTEX, No. 161,at 3). A number of comments, on the other hand, supported the Department's conclusionthat a 78 percent AFUE standard on small gas furnaces would not resultin a significant shift from natural gas to electric resistance heat. BardManufacturing Company (Bard) and GAMA concluded that a 78 percent AFUEsmall furnace standard should not result in a loss of market share by gasutilities because: (1) The price differential between a 71 percent AFUEand a 78 percent AFUE furnace in today's marketplace would not apply in1992 when NAECA standards go into effect; (2) the cost to upgrade olderhomes to the 200 amp service needed for electric heating makes it unlikelythat gas furnaces would lose market share to electric resistance heatingin replacement markets; (3) in the new construction market in the South,gas furnaces compete against heat pumps, not against electric resistanceheating; and, (4) in new construction, the cost of venting a 78 percentAFUE fan-assisted combustion system gas furnace through the wall is, inmost cases, less than the cost of venting a 71 percent AFUE atmosphericcombustion gas furnace, which would require construction of a chimney forventing. (Bard, No. 90, at 1-2; and GAMA, No. 129, at 3-6). <ITAG tagnum="84">Market Share </ITAG>In response to comments received, DOE revised several assumptions thathave an impact on the market shares of gas furnaces, including: Energyprice projections, maintenance costs of efficient gas furnaces, conversioncosts from gas to electric heat, and retrofit costs for replacing smallgas furnaces. These changes are reported in the Technical Support Document.GAMA data indicate that 40 percent of 1985 shipments of all gas warm aircentral furnaces were at or above 71 percent AFUE, and that 61 percentof small gas furnaces sold in 1985 were at or above 71 percent AFUE. (1985is the most recent year for which data on small gas furnace shipments areavailable). In 1988, 52 percent of all gas furnaces shipped were at orabove 71 percent AFUE. DOE believes that the more efficient furnaces arebeing bought both for replacement and for use in new housing. AGA datashow increasing market shares for gas heating, and a substantial numberof conversions from electric heat to gas heat. (AGA, No. 128, Attachment1, at 4 and 11). In light of the current market for gas furnaces, DOE doesnot believe that purchasers, including builders, are sensitive only toequipment costs. Therefore, DOE has modeled the market decisions basedupon observed market behavior. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Appendix B. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fuel Switching</ITAG>In a related comment, ENTEX charged that the Department had not adequatelyaddressed fuel-switching because LBL-REM ``does not emulate the marketplacefor furnaces in new residential construction, where builders decide onwhich type of heating equipment is installed, and are extremely sensitiveto the initial cost of the equipment.'' (ENTEX, No. 161, at 3). As described in the proposed rule, LBL-REM had been modified for the purposeof analyzing small gas furnaces, to take account of the sensitivity toinitial equipment cost and other sensitivities that have been reflectedin actual market purchases in new homes. In addition, LBL-REM models thesensitivity to first cost as a function of climate, with purchasers inmilder climates more sensitive to first cost (relative to operating cost)than purchasers in more severe climates. This information was reportedon pages B-10 and B-11 of the proposed rule's Technical Support Document.These modifications were maintained in the analysis for this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Oversizing Factor </ITAG>In the analysis of small gas furnaces, the Department assumed that furnaceswould be oversized for the expected heating loads by a factor of 2.3. Thisassumption was derived from AGA data for existing furnaces. Several comments suggested that, with the trend toward less oversizing,the Department was using an unrealistic assumption about the future, wherein,it is argued, smaller equipment, more suited to actual heating loads, willbe installed. These comments contend, therefore, that by using an unrealisticallyhigh oversizing factor, the Department has underestimated the size of thefuture market for small gas furnaces. (LGC, No. 121, at 4; EEI, No. 127,at 8; and NRDC, No. 81, at 92). In response, the Department analyzed a small gas furnace sensitivity casewith an oversizing factor of 1.3. This resulted in much higher shipmentsand a correspondingly higher net present value. In addition, the impactsof standards remained small. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Tables 5.28 and 5.31.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rebound Effect</ITAG>In the analysis for the proposed rule, the Department assumed that purchasersof more efficient furnaces, with a 78 percent AFUE standard, could utilizethem more intensively than expected, and thereby reduce the energy savingsbelow what the engineering estimates would otherwise project. This so-called``rebound effect'' was assumed to be 30 percent, so that only 70 percentof the engineering estimates of expected savings would actually be expectedto result.This estimate of a 30 percent rebound effect was criticized in severalcomments, which argued that the rebound should be lower, and perhaps equalto zero. (AEPSSC, No. 136, at 13; EEI, No. 127, at 9; NRDC, No. 81, at93; and NYSEO, No. 156, at 2 and 28-30).In response, in a sensitivity analysis for the final rule, the Departmentremoved the rebound effect with respect to operating expense for all smallheating systems. Usage behavior, however, was still assumed to be a functionof income.Setting the usage elasticity with respect to operating cost at zero wasexpected to increase the energy savings attributed to standards. Sincethe rebound effect was eliminated for all small heating systems, the impactswere observed among other fuels, as well as natural gas.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Issues</ITAG>EEI commented that in the proposed rule, the Department underestimatedheat pump shipments. (EEI, No. 127, at 9).In the final rule, the Department revised the heat pumps shipments to agreewith reported shipments from 1980-1987. These results are presented inthe Technical Support Document. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.18.Lastly, LGC commented that since the choice of space heating fuel usuallydetermines the choice of water heating, the relevant comparison is notbetween a small gas furnace and electric resistance heat, but, rather,it is between a small gas furnace with a gas water heater and electricresistance heat with an electric water heater. (LGC, No. 121, at 5).While the Department agrees that water heating fuel choice is usually linkedto space heating fuel in new construction, LBL-REM treats these end-usesseparately. The model cannot handle these two appliance choices jointly,but, by modeling the results for small furnaces <T3>vis a vis</T3> electric heat, the Department believes that water heatersales are not an issue that affects the analysis.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Manufacturer Analysis</ITAG>There were three areas of the manufacturer analysis for the proposed rulethat drew comments. Comments were submitted dealing with the markup andprices that were used, the pricing and production of 71 percent AFUE furnacesafter 1992, and the impacts of standards on gas furnace manufacturers.<ITAG tagnum="84">Markup</ITAG>The Energen Corporation (Energen) asserted that the manufacturer analysis``was based on manufacturing cost estimates instead of actual contractorpricing,'' and it did not take into account that higher efficiency furnacesreceive higher markups. (Energen, No. 82, at 5-6).In response, the Department notes that the manufacturer analysis takesinto account, in a limited way, the fact that higher efficiency furnacesreceive higher markups. Small gas furnaces of 90 percent AFUE, and higher,receive a manufacturer markup of 1.3, while lower efficiency furnaces receivea markup of 1.15. These markups are based on data gathered from contractorsby DOE for the proposed rule. All large furnaces receive a markup of 1.3.After 1992, furnaces with lower than 80 percent AFUE rating will be theleast efficient furnaces on the market, and thus will receive the lowestmanufacturer markup. Most comments that provided data used current priceand markup lists, but manufacturers testified that their costs, markups,and pricing will change when the Act's standards go into effect. (Rheem,No. 67, at 2; and GAMA, No. 129, at 3-4).With regard to the analysis considering only ``manufacturing cost estimatesinstead of actual contractor pricing,'' the Department has learned throughdiscussions with contractors that ``actual contractor pricing'' is highlyvariable, and that the Department's estimates of price differences arefairly reasonable.The Department had estimated that the current price difference betweena 71 percent AFUE small gas furnace and a 78 percent AFUE one to be $137.Several gas utilities, e.g., Enserch (No. 51), Energen (andplusmin;82), Laclede(No. 121), and PSCNC (No. 144), criticized that price difference as beingtoo low. The submissions of those companies had price differences rangingfrom $200 (Laclede) to $467 (PSCNC).On the other hand, one gas furnace manufacturer, Carrier Corporation (Carrier),supported the Department's estimate of the current price difference betweena 71 percent AFUE and 78 percent AFUE furnace:<ITAG tagnum="21">We believe that the DOE estimate of $87 (sic) installed cost differentialbetween atmospheric and induced draft furnaces of less than 45,000 BTU/His reasonable. Carrier's estimate of installed cost differential is approximately$100. In no event would we expect the differential to exceed $150. (Carrier,No. 143, at 1).</ITAG>While the Department does not doubt that the price differences submittedby the gas utilities have occurred, Carrier's support of DOE's estimateof the price difference between a 71 percent AFUE and 78 percent AFUE smallfurnace gives the Department confidence that its estimate is reasonable.In all likelihood there is a range of price differentials. In addition,because Carrier is a manufacturer of these appliances, the Department believesthat its numbers are representative. Furthermore, gas furnace manufacturersstated in their comments that the price difference between 78 percent and71 percent furnaces would certainly decrease in 1992 when NAECA standardsgo into effect. (Rheem, No. 67, at 2; Snyder General Corporation (Snyder),No. 73, at 3; and GAMA, No. 129, at 2-4).The proposed rule had indicated that using current prices of those furnaceswould overstate the retail price difference that would prevail after standardson larger gas furnaces went into effect 1992 because:(1) Seventy-one percent AFUE furnaces would become more expensive in 1992because they no longer would be the standard type of furnace, but insteadwould be a specialty product which would be produced in short productionruns about twice a year, or be purchased from another manufacturer (thusincurring an extra level of markup).(2) Seventy-eight percent AFUE furnaces will become less expensive in 1992because they will be produced in even larger quantities then.(3) Seventy-eight percent AFUE furnaces will become less expensive undera 78 percent standard because they will then be the ``bottom of the line''furnace and receive the lowest markup, whereas they now receive a highermarkup.<ITAG tagnum="84">Impact on Manufacturers</ITAG>Last, SCGC questions the Department's conclusion that a 78 percent AFUEminimum energy conservation standard on small gas furnaces would have aminimum impact on manufacturers. (SCGC, No. 134, at 4).In response, the Department notes that SCGC has reservations about theassertion that manufacturers will be better off manufacturing like products,i.e., after 1992 all furnaces would be 78 percent AFUE or more, and thatthe overall impact is a high return on investment.However, SCGC's assertion is in error. First, the proposed rule does notconclude that the overall impact of gas furnace standards is a high returnon investment for manufacturers. In fact, LBL-MIM estimates that standardswill cause a decrease in ROE of less than 0.01 percent. Second, the SCGCdoubts that manufacturers can manufacture high efficiency furnaces andbe better off, and then rebuts its own statement by citing Lennox as acompany that produces high-efficiency furnaces and does well. In addition,manufacturers have stated that they are better off not having to maintaina separate production line for lower-efficiency small gas furnaces. (Rheem,No. 67, at 2; and GAMA, No. 129, at 2-4). Last, no gas furnace manufacturerhas commented on the estimate that standards will have a minimum impacton such manufacturers.As a result, the Department continues to believe that a 78 percent AFUEstandard on small gas furnaces will have a minimum impact on manufacturers.3. Utility AnalysisSCGC commented that the utility analysis should have included estimatesof the lost revenues to gas utilities that would result from a 78 percentAFUE small gas furnace standard. (SCGC, No. 134, at 5).In response the Department notes that a separate analysis of impacts onthe gas utilities was not performed. The Department notes that an electricutility impacts analysis was performed to address significant economicimpacts from appliance efficiency standards, based on calculations specificto the electric utility industry. The utility analysis also provides inputsto the environmental analysis.Furthermore, the Act requires that the Department examine any possibleshift to electric resistance heating. This is accomplished through theLBL-REM.The electric utility analysis was originally undertaken because: (1) Theexpected economic impacts of standards on electric utilities were expectedto be large; (2) it was important to estimate the peak demand and capacitysavings from any standards, since electricity cannot be stored. In addition,power plant capacity has been increasing in cost, and has been more difficultto site and build in recent years; and (3) the environmental impact analysisrequired information about which generating plants would be curtailed inresponse to the changes in load brought about by any standards.The Department's utility analysis did not include gas utilities because:(1) The expected economic impacts of small gas furnace standards on gasutilities are small on a national scale; (2) natural gas can be stored,so capacity savings, fixed costs, and the consequent potential revenuelosses are not as large a problem for gas utilities as for electric ones.Gas utilities typically have 20-40 percent of their costs attributableto fixed costs, while electric utilities typically have upwards of 50 percentof their costs attributable to fixed costs. In addition, the costs of layingnatural gas transmission and distribution pipelines, which represent themajor share of the fixed costs in the natural gas industry, have not beenincreasing substantially over time (unlike power plant capital costs);and, (3) the environmental analysis calculates these impacts directly fromthe amount of natural gas consumed, without the need for an interveningutility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Product Specific Discussion</ITAG>a. Refrigerators<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed</ITAG>DOE examined a range of standard levels, including the 1990 NAECA standards.As discussed above, the impacts of any revised standards were comparedto the 1990 NAECA standards; therefore, the impacts of the base case aregenerally not presented because they are calculated to be zero.Table 4-1 presents the efficiency levels, other than the base case, selectedfor analysis for 1993. Alternate levels were selected to generate a rangeof impacts for analysis. Initially, the levels were selected for the classof top-mount, automatic defrost refrigerator-freezer without through-the-doorice service. Level 5 corresponds to the highest efficiency level consideredin the engineering analysis. This is the maximum technologically feasiblelevel. It was felt that manufacturers can assemble appliances at this efficiency.Level 4 generally corresponds to the minimum life-cycle cost point. Levels1 through 3 correspond to efficiencies lower than that of level 4. Eachlevel was analyzed discretely in the engineering analysis. Standard levelsfor each of the other classes of refrigerators were based on the combinationof design options for the top-mount, automatic defrost refrigerator-freezerwithout through-the-door ice service. The top-mount automatic defrost refrigerator-freezerwas used as the analytical model for the analysis because that class representsnearly 73 percent of new refrigerator and refrigerator-freezer sales.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>4.1._<T4>Alternative Efficiency Levels for </T4>1993 <T4>Refrigerators, Refrigerator-Freezers and Freezers</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Energy Consumption KWh/Yr.]</ITAG><H1>Product class </H1><H1>Level analyzed</H1><H2>1</H2><H2>2</H2><H2>3</H2><H2>4</H2><H2>5</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers with manual defrost <D>105+25.2andmultiply;AV </D><D>104+23.9andmultiply;AV </D><D>98+19.9andmultiply;AV </D><D>70+14.7andmultiply;AV </D><D>70+14.7andmultiply;AV</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Refrigerator-freezer_partial automatic defrost <D>423+11.9andmultiply;AV </D><D>420+11.2andmultiply;AV </D><D>398+10.4andmultiply;AV </D><D>383+7.1andmultiply;AV </D><D>383+7.1andmultiply;AV</D></ITAG>Refrigerator-freezers_automatic defrost with:<ITAG tagnum="3">Top-mounted freezer without through-the-door ice service.\1\ </ITAG><D>391+18.9andmultiply;AV </D><D>376+17.1andmultiply;AV </D><D>355+16.0andmultiply;AV </D><D>329+11.8andmultiply;AV </D><D>290+10.4andmultiply;AV</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Side-mounted freezer without through-the-door ice service </ITAG><D>574+15.0andmultiply;AV </D><D>539+13.7andmultiply;AV </D><D>501+11.8andmultiply;AV </D><D>444+8.8andmultiply;AV </D><D>377+7.5andmultiply;AV</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Bottom-mounted freezer without through-the-door ice service </ITAG><D>397+18.0andmultiply;AV </D><D>371+16.3andmultiply;AV </D><D>364+14.2andmultiply;AV </D><D>290+12.7andmultiply;AV </D><D>248+10.9andmultiply;AV</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Top-mounted freezer with through-the-door ice service </ITAG><D>431+20.8andmultiply;AV </D><D>414+18.8andmultiply;AV </D><D>391+17.6andmultiply;AV </D><D>363+13.0andmultiply;AV </D><D>310+11.0andmultiply;AV</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Side-mounted freezer with through-the-door ice service </ITAG><D>594+20.6andmultiply;AV </D><D>571+18.0andmultiply;AV </D><D>527+16.3andmultiply;AV </D><D>408+14.7andmultiply;AV </D><D>347+12.5andmultiply;AV</D>Upright freezers with:<ITAG tagnum="3">Manual defrost </ITAG><D>286+13.1andmultiply;AV </D><D>276+12.5andmultiply;AV </D><D>264+10.3andmultiply;AV </D><D>211+7.8andmultiply;AV </D><D>211+7.8andmultiply;AV</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Automatic defrost </ITAG><D>449+19.0andmultiply;AV </D><D>425+17.6andmultiply;AV </D><D>391+14.9andmultiply;AV </D><D>322+10.7andmultiply;AV </D><D>311+10.3andmultiply;AV</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Chest freezers and all other freezers <D>140+14.2andmultiply;AV </D><D>139+13.8andmultiply;AV </D><D>124+12.0andmultiply;AV </D><D>85+7.3andmultiply;AV </D><D>85+7.3andmultiply;AV</D><F>\1\ Including all refrigerators with automatic defrost.</F><F>AV = Total adjusted volume, expressed in Ft. 3.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">2.

As noted earlier, under ``Selection of CandidateStandard Levels,'' paybacks are calculated for the 1993 time period whichincludes the assumption that CFC-11 and -12 are available.For most classes, standard level 3 corresponds to the most stringent energyconservation standard level at which the additional expense of purchasinga product at this efficiency level will be less than three times the valueof the energy savings that the consumer will receive during the first year.The payback period for refrigerators that meet standard level 1 efficiencyranges from a low of 0.10 year for a manual defrost refrigerator to a highof 1.62 years for a partial automatic defrost refrigerator-freezer; thepayback period for refrigerators that meet standard level 2 efficiencyranges from a low of 0.90 year for a side by side automatic defrost refrigerator-freezerwith through-the-door service to a high of 1.73 years for a partial automaticdefrost refrigerator-freezer; at standard level 3, the paybacks range froma low of 1.27 years for an upright, manual defrost freezer to a high of3.65 years for a manual defrost refrigerator; the payback period for unitsthat meet level 4 efficiency ranges from 3.24 years for a partial automaticdefrost refrigerator-freezer to 7.91 years for a manual defrost chest freezer;and, the standard level 5 paybacks range from allow of 3.24 years for apartial automatic defrost refrigerator-freezer to a high of 7.91 yearsfor a manual defrost chest freezer. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document Tables 6.3 and 6.4.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,15</C><T4>Table </T4>4.2._<T4>Payback Period (Years) Top Mount Auto Defrost Refrigerator-Freezer,Without Through-The-Door Features </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Adjusted Volume=20.8 Cu.

Significance of Energy Savings</ITAG>To estimate the base case energy savings by the year 2015, the weightedaverage energy consumption of new refrigerators sold in the absence ofrevised standards is compared to 1990 when the legislated standards becomeeffective.

Economic Justification</ITAG>A. <T3>Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers.</T3> The per unit increasedcost to manufacturers to meet the level 5 efficiency ranges from $65.30for a 25.3 cubic foot AV upright automatic defrost freezer to $141.25 fora 31.9 cubic foot AV automatic defrost refrigerator-freezer with side freezerand through-the-door services. The cost for the most prevalent class ofproduct (automatic-defrost refrigerator-freezer with top-mounted freezer)would increase $129.65. For level 4 efficiency, the per unit increasedcost to manufacturers to meet that efficiency ranges from $47.30 for a22.5 cubic foot chest freezer to $75.25 for a 31.9 cubic foot automaticdefrost refrigerator-freezer with side freezer and through-the-door services.The cost for the most prevalent class of product (automatic-defrost refrigerator-freezerwith top-mounted freezer) would increase $63.65. The per unit increasedcost to manufacturers to meet the level 3 efficiency ranges from $25.20to $50.85, while level 2 cost increases range from $8.10 to $20.25. Forlevel 1, the cost increases are from $3.60 to $7.30. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Tables 3.14-3.23.In the base case, the LBL-MIM, projects manufacturers' long-run ROE tobe 9.73 percent for refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers and 8.60 percentfor freezers. At level 5, the LBL-MIM predicts that a prototypical refrigeratorand refrigerator-freezer manufacturer would have a gain in its ROE to 13.20percent, a gain of 35.7 percent. The projected ROE's at levels 3 and 4,respectively, would be to 10.27 percent, a gain of 5.5 percent, and to11.85 percent, a gain of 21.8 percent. At levels 1 and 2, the refrigeratorand refrigerator-freezer manufacturers' ROE are expected to improve respectively,to 9.95 percent (an improvement of 2.3 percent) and to 10.24 percent (animprovement of 5.2 percent). For freezer manufacturers, the ROE is expectedto improve to 8.97 percent (an improvement of 4.3 percent) and to 8.96percent (an increase of 4.2 percent) for levels 1 and 2, respectively.<T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Tables 7.9 and 7.10.The Department's characterization of the prototypical manufacturer in thebase case assumes that manufacturers' typical refrigerator, refrigerator-freezerand freezer designs are based on the combination of options presented inthe Engineering Analysis. As discussed above, DOE revised the base casebased on the comments received. However, manufacturers that use a differentcombination of design options to comply with the 1990 NAECA standard, mayhave a different financial position than the prototypical manufacturerin the LBL-MIM.The sensitivity analysis indicates the refrigerator, refrigerator-freezerand freezer industry is sensitive to price and operating expense elasticities.For example, the high price and low operating cost scenario indicates thatthe effects of standards would be to decrease ROE for refrigerator, refrigerator-freezermanufacturers by nearly 3.3 percent, and 10.7 percent for freezer manufacturers,in the base case. <T3>See</T3> Technical Document, Tables 7.17 and 7.18.For consumers, standard level 5 would cause price increases that wouldrange from a low of $151.20 for an automatic defrost, upright freezer,to a high of $353.14 for an automatic defrost, side-by-side refrigerator-freezerwith through-the-door services. The price would increase for the most prevalentclass of product (automatic-defrost refrigerator-freezer with top-mountedfreezer) by $172.34. The corresponding range of price increases at standardlevel 4 would be a low of $98.00 for a chest freezer and a high of $189.12for an automatic defrost, side-by-side refrigerator-freezer. The pricefor the most prevalent class of product would increase $134.48. The priceincrease to consumers at standard level 3 ranges from $59.23 to $16.99,while level 2 price increases range from $19.00 to $46.36. For level 1,the price increases range from $8.40 to $112.10. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Tables 3.31-3.40.B. <T3>Life Cycle Cost and Net Present Value</T3>. The LCC analysis indicatesthat, for each possible standard level, the increase in purchase pricewould be offset by savings in operating expenses. Standard level 4 generallycorresponds to the minimum for each of the life-cycle cost curves. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Figures 3.13-3.22. This indicatesthat the standard level would not cause any economic burden on the averageconsumer. DOE examined the effect of different discount rates, 5, 7 and10 percent, on the LCC curves and generally found little impact.The LBL-REM employs national average energy prices and usage rates. Theappropriateness of this approach depends on the relationship between energyprices and consumer choice of efficiency levels and the relationship betweenconsumers' expected usage and choice of energy efficiency level.The NPV analysis indicates that if a standard were adopted at level 5,there would be an NPV of $9.3 billion from energy savings over the period1993-2015. At level 4, the corresponding NPV would be $11.8 billion; atlevel 3, $9.1 billion; at level 2, $7.7 billion; and, at level 1, the correspondingNPV would be $6.0 billion. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.14.C. <T3>Energy Savings</T3>. As discussed above, DOE concludes that standards,at each candidate standard level, would result in a significant savingof energy.D. <T3>Lessening of Utility or Performance of Products</T3>. As indicatedabove, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that thestandards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performanceor refrigerators.One of the design options, increased foam thickness on the refrigeratorwalls, could serve to reduce interior volume slightly. It has been arguedthat if manufacturers used this design option to achieve a level of refrigeratorenergy-efficiency, the impact on consumers could be some small loss ofutility. DOE, however, does not believe that the small reduction in interiorvolume that may be caused by this standard will cause any utility lossesamong consumers. Furthermore, the Department notes that manufacturers neednot use this design option, as they would be free to use other energy-conservingdesign options, e.g., dual compressors, to achieve a standard level, evenif that level had been based on thicker sidewalls in the analysis.E. <T3>Impact of Lessening of Competition</T3>. In accordance with the requirementsof the Act, the Department of Justice (DOJ) evaluated the impacts on competitionof the proposed rule. Based on its analysis and review of the proposedrule, DOJ concluded that the proposed standards (levels 1-3) would notlessen competition in the refrigerator, refrigerator-freezers and freezermarkets. <T3>See</T3> DOJ, No. 162.DOJ states that for standards to affect competition adversely, standards-inducedcost increases would have to be sufficiently severe and asymmetrical thatthey would force from the market one or more significant competitors. Inaddition, levels of concentration would have to rise substantially becauseof such exits. Also other market conditions would have to be conduciveto oligopolistic pricing or price fixing. DOJ concludes, based on availableevidence, that such a lessening of competition would not likely occur ifDOE adopts any of the proposed standards for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezersand freezers. DOJ did not examine the more efficient standard levels 4and 5. Also, DOJ rejects the Department's assertion, in the proposed rule,that the proposed standards will increase profits. As discussed above,one reason LBL-MIM predicted an increase in ROE and profitability, wasthe LBL-REM's forecast of increased refrigerator, refrigerator-freezer,and freezer sales. This had been changed in the LBL-REM in the analysisfor the final rule.The Department notes, further, that the changes to the analysis that weredone for the final rule should not affect the conclusions derived fromthe DOJ review on the proposed rule.Therefore, based upon its review of the DOJ analysis, DOE concludes thatstandard levels 1, 2 and 3 would not adversely affect competition. However,the Department believes that standard levels 4 and 5, which would requirethe use of evacuated panels, could affect competition. No U.S. manufacturerhas manufactured refrigerators with evacuated panels on a high volume basis.GE manufactured a limited number, 1,000 units, by hand, and subsequentlydiscontinued the unit. The Department believes that the technological problemsthat exist in mass producing evacuated panel refrigerators are such thatit is likely that major manufacturers would consider leaving the market.This industry has experienced numerous mergers.DOE believes that one likely result of standards at level 5 could be toincrease the rate of industry consolidation by merger of two significantcompetitors, which could result in a substantially larger firm. DOE believesthat standards at level 5 could lessen competition by increasing levelsof concentration. The Department further believes that standards at level4, which involves efficiencies attained with evacuated panels, could leadto some firms leaving the industry, because of an inability to produceor purchase sufficient numbers of panels.F. <T3>Need of the Nation to Save Energy</T3>. Refrigerators use electricityas their energy source. Nearly seven percent of the nation's total electricity(which required source energy of 29.5 Quads in 1988) powers refrigerators,and nearly 13 percent of that seven percent would be saved by standardsfor this product at level 3, while 21 percent of that seven percent wouldbe saved at level 4, and over 26 percent of that amount would be savedat level 5. Levels 1 and 2 would save 6 and 9 percent, respectively. Inaddition, decreasing future electricity demand as a result of standardswill decrease air pollution. The greatest decreases in air pollution willoccur for sulfur oxides (listed in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide,or SO<T2>2</T2>). For standard level 5, in the year 2010, the estimated SO<T2>2</T2> reduction would be 256,933 tons. This reduction represents 1.5percent of the United States SO<T2>2</T2> emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants inthat year.Standard level 5 would also result in a decrease in nitrogen dioxide (NO<T2>2</T2>) emissions for the year 2010, of 173,715 tons. This decreaserepresents 1.7 percent of the total NO<T2>2</T2> emissions expected to be emitted by power plants in that year.Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon dioxide(CO<T2>2</T2>) emissions. Fossil fuel burning is believed to elevate CO<T2>2</T2> concentrations in the atmosphere, which is believed to trapheat from the sun that has been absorbed by the Earth and would normallybe re-radiated. Although there is substantial scientific uncertainty concerningthe magnitude and timing of this effect, this ``greenhouse effect'' isthought to raise the mean global temperature. Standard level 5 is estimatedto reduce United States CO<T2>2</T2> emissions by about 0.88 percent for the year 2010.In 2010, standard level 4 is expected to reduce SO<T2>2</T2>, NO<T2>2</T2> and CO<T2>2</T2> emissions by 1.2, 1.35, and 0.7 percent, respectively. Standardlevel 3 reductions are expected to be 0.72, 0.81, and 0.42 percent forSO<T2>2</T2>, NO<T2>2</T2> and CO<T2>2</T2>, respectively in 2010.Standard levels 2 and 1 would reduce SO<T2>2</T2> power plant emissions by 0.51 and 0.33 percent, respectively.NO<T2>2</T2> power plant emissions would be reduced by 0.58 and 0.38 percentfor standard levels 2 and 1, respectively in 2010; CO<T2>2</T2> emissions at standard levels 2 and 1 would be 0.3 and 0.19 percent,respectively of the total U.S. amount.G. Other Factors.Refrigerators typically use CFCs-11 and -12. Both of these refrigerantsare subject to an EPA rulemaking that places restrictions on the manufactureof certain CFCs. Furthermore, based on comments in this rulemaking, DOEbelieves that these CFCs would not be available after the year 2000, eitheras a result of amendments to the Montreal Protocol, further EPA restrictionsor marketplace forces. DuPont, for example, announced that it intends tophase out production of these CFCs by 2000.The use of CFCs in the manufacture of refrigerators currently accountsfor approximately two percent of the restricted CFCs. The 50 percent reductionin CFC manufacture prescribed by EPA, will likely result in the use ofCFCs in refrigerators to exceed five percent of U.S. consumption. Thisincrease in the percentage of CFC consumption accounted for by refrigeratorswould be a result of the CFC production restriction along with increasedCFC use to meet the legislated 1990 standards, and increased sale of theseproducts. Presently, DOE is unaware of any currently available alternativesto CFC-11 or CFC-12 that have been demonstrated as acceptable replacementsto the affected CFCs. However, as discussed above, likely alternativeshave been identified. Based upon the comments on the proposed rule, DOEassumed that suitable alternatives will be developed; however, the scheduleby which these alternatives will become available in sufficient quantitiesis unknown at this time. As discussed above, DOE's engineering analysisis based on alternatives, and DOE has assumed that these alternatives willbe adopted by refrigerator manufacturers by 1996.<ITAG tagnum="84">5. Conclusion</ITAG>Section 325(1)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the Department must consider,for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve the maximum improvementin energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologicallyfeasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the Department firstconsidered the ``max tech'' level of efficiency, i.e., standard level 5,for amended refrigerator standards.Of the standard levels analyzed, level 5 saved the most energy (10.8 quadsmore than the base case). In addition, it had the largest positive impacton the environment.Two of the three technologies needed to meet this standard level, adaptivedefrost and dual compressors, are available now in some refrigerators;however, the third item, evacuated panels, is not currently available ona mass produced basis. While some refrigerators with hand-built evacuatedpanels have been produced for sale, the Department does not believe thatevacuated panels can be mass produced by the effective date of this standard,especially considering the need for additional capacity to manufacturefumed and precipitated silica, as previously discussed in the EngineeringAnalysis.Furthermore, the cost of these three technologies is high, producing arelatively large increase in purchase price. While the life-cycle costof Level 5 is lower than that of the base case, the purchase price pushesthe payback to 6.9 years, and, by being beyond the minimum life-cycle costpoint, would preclude consumers from buying models with the lowest life-cyclecost. The impact on manufacturers is expected to be positive, producingthe highest long-run increase in net income and return-on-equity of allthe standard levels analyzed. However, these results are based on the assumptionthat sufficient quantities of the necessary technologies will be availablein 1993, and as noted above, the Department is doubtful that one of thosetechnologies, evacuated panels, will be available in sufficient quantitiesby then. In addition, the Department also believes that the required useof evacuated panels could cause a lessening of competition. Overall, theDepartment finds the burdens, especially the technological uncertaintiesof level 5, to exceed the benefits, and, therefore, rejects level 5.Standard level 4, also based on evacuated panels. saves the second greatestamount of energy, an estimated 8.7 Quads, and has the second most positiveimpact on the environment. However, the above discussion on evacuated panelsalso applies to level 4. While the purchase price is less than that oflevel 5, and while life-cycle cost is the lowest of any level analyzed,level 4 still produces a payback of 6.0 years. The impact on manufacturersis estimated to produce the second highest long-run increase in net incomeand return-on-equity of the standard levels analyzed. Overall the Departmentfinds the burdens of level 4, especially the technological uncertainties,to exceed the benefits, and, therefore, rejects level 4, too.Energy efficiencies approaching those of level 4 could be achieved by areordering of the design options, e.g., by substituting dual compressorsand adaptive defrost for evacuated panels. As noted above, however, designoptions were added on the basis of increasing time for payback, and dualcompressors and adaptive defrost were added last because of their relativelylong paybacks. Therefore, while a combination of the design options instandard level 3 with dual compressors and adaptive defrost designs couldproduce energy savings and environmental benefits approaching those oflevel 4, such a combination of designs would also probably have much higherconsumer burdens than level 4, in the form of higher prices and longerpaybacks. This would result because dual compressors and adaptive defrosthave a higher initial price than evacuated panels, and produce similarenergy savings. On balance, then, the Department finds that the burdensof this version of level 4 also exceed the benefits, and, therefore, rejectsall combinations of level 4.The next most energy-conserving standard level is standard level 3. Aftercarefully considering all parts of the analysis, the Department is amendingthe NAECA-imposed 1990 standard for refrigerators with standard level 3for refrigerators. The Department concludes that level 3 standards forrefrigerators save a significant amount of energy, are technically feasible,and are economically justified.As discussed above, there would be significant energy savings at this levelof efficiency. During the period 1993-2015, these savings are calculatedto be 5.2 Quads of primary electricity compared to the base case. Suchsavings would total nearly 13 percent of base case electricity use. Inaddition, the standards will have a positive impact on the environmentby reducing the emissions of CO<T2>2</T2>, SO<T2>2</T2>, and NO<T2>2</T2> by an estimated .42, .72, and .81 percent, respectively, bythe year 2010.The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presentlyavailable. This standard level may initially involve the use of additionalamounts of ozone-depleting CFCs; however, these additional amounts willcome at the expense of other products that presently use the restrictedCFCs. The amounts needed for refrigeration manufacturing are relativelysmall and the Department believes they will be available, albeit at a higherprice.The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The standardlevel meets the rebuttable presumption test for economic justificationby having a payback of 2.5 years. Furthermore, the standard level substantiallyreduces consumer life-cycle costs and only moderately increases initialprice. Additionally, the standard is also expected to have a positive impacton manufacturers by producing long-run increases in their net income andreturn-on-equity of 21.8 and 5.4 percent, respectively.b.

Significance of Energy Savings</ITAG>By the year 2015, the weighted average energy efficiency of new small gasfurnaces sold in the absence of standards is projected to be 79.9 percentAFUE. Standards, at standard levels 1 and 3, are expected to increase theaverage shipment weighted efficiency of small gas furnaces to between 81.0and 83.4 percent AFUE, respectively. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.16. However, the aggregateannual energy consumption of small gas furnaces is projected to increaseslightly. This is due to the increase in the market for small gas furnaceswhich comes at the expense of larger gas furnaces, heat pumps, and centralelectric furnaces. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.18. When energy conservationstandards are imposed on small gas furnaces, the LBL-REM projects that,over the period 1992-2015, the following changes in energy consumptionwould occur:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s100,4.3,4.3,4.3,4.3</C><T4>Table</T4> 4.5._<T4>Cumulative Residential Energy Consumption of Gas and Electricity forSpace Heating,</T4> 1992-2015 <T4>(Quadrillion Btu, Primary)</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Base</H1><H1>Standard level</H1><H2>1</H2><H2>2</H2><H2>3</H2>Gas heating systems:<ITAG tagnum="3">Small gas furnaces</ITAG><D>1.05</D><D>1.06</D><D>1.08</D><D>1.09</D><ITAG tagnum="1">All gas heating<D>91.7</D><D>91.7</D><D>91.6</D><D>91.6</D></ITAG>Electric heating systems:<ITAG tagnum="3">Central electric furnaces</ITAG><D>30.4</D><D>30.3</D><D>30.3</D><D>30.3</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Electric heat pumps</ITAG><D>14.9</D><D>14.8</D><D>14.8</D><D>14.8</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Electric baseboard heat</ITAG><D>14.2</D><D>14.2</D><D>14.2</D><D>14.2</D><ITAG tagnum="1">All electric heating<D>59.5</D><D>59.3</D><D>59.3</D><D>59.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total gas and electric<D>151.2</D><D>151.0</D><D>150.9</D><D>150.9</D><F>Source: Technical Support Document, Table 5.18.</F></ITAG></ITAG>As Table 4.5 shows, standard level 1 would lead to an increase in smallgas furnace energy consumption of .01 Quadrillion Btu (Quads), but wouldresult in a net energy savings of .02 Quads. At standard levels 2 and 3,the net energy savings would total .03 Quads.The Department finds these net energy savings to be significant.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Economic Justification</ITAG>A. <T3>Economic Impact on Manufacturers and Consumers. </T3>The per unit increasedcost to manufacturers to meet the level 3 efficiency ranges from $64 foran indoor gas furnace to $88 for an outdoor gas furnace. The per unit increasedmanufacturer cost to meet levels 1 and 2 are $21 and $96, respectively,for an indoor unit; for an outdoor unit, the per unit cost increases are$25 and $97 for levels 1 and 2, respectively. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Tables 3.24 and 3.25.At standard level 3 of efficiency, the price to the consumer increases$217 for indoor gas furnaces and $247.90 for outdoor gas furnaces. Theper unit increased consumer price at levels 1 and 2 are $77.91 and $208.39,respectively, for an indoor unit; for an outdoor unit, the per unit priceincreases are $84.83 and $226.94 for levels 1 and 2, respectively. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Tables 3.41 and 3.42.The LBL-REM results indicate that standards at level 3 will result in nearlya four percent improvement in average shipment weighted efficiency whencompared to standard level 1. This would result in a $178 drop in life-cyclecosts for an indoor, warm air, small gas furnace; for an outdoor one, theLCC savings would be $154.In the LBL-MIM results for small gas furnaces, it was found that standardswould cause manufacturers to lose even more money on these furnaces thanthey are projected to lose in the base or no-standards case. In the basecase, manufacturers' ROE are expected to be ^2.02 percent for small furnaces,compared to an ROE of a ^2.13 percent under standard level 3 and ^2.03percent under standard level 1. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 7.16.Small gas furnaces tend to have very low profit margins and thus they contributelittle or nothing to a gas furnace manufacturer's profitability. DOE believesthis is because of marketing considerations, in that manufacturers findit important for marketing purposes to carry a complete line of furnacecapacities. Thus, manufacturers tend to carry small gas furnaces in theirproduct lines, although many of these firms carry only one or two models.LBL-MIM projects that a standard of either 71, 74, or 78 percent AFUE forsmall gas furnaces would result in lower net income and ROE than wouldoccur in the absence of standards.The LBL-MIM predicts at level 3 that a prototypical furnace manufacturerwould experience a .001 percent decrease in ROE. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 7.23. The sensitivity analysis,however, indicates the gas furnace industry results are sensitive to consumerprice elasticities and unit variable cost increases. For example, the sensitivityanalysis indicates that the effects of standards could be to decrease return-on-equityfor small gas furnace manufacturers by nearly 1.2 percent or to raise itby nearly the same amount. However, there is only a one percent chanceof either of these sensitivity results occurring.B. <T3>Life Cycle Cost and Net Present Value. </T3>The LCC analysis indicatesthat at each possible standard level, the increase in purchase price wouldbe offset by savings in operating expenses. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 6.7. Also, of the threecandidate standard levels, level 3 had the lowest consumer life-cycle cost.The decreasing life-cycle-costs indicate that the standard level wouldhave the greatest benefit to consumers.The NPV analysis indicates that if a standard were adopted at level 3,there would be a net present value of $21 million to consumers. At levels1 and 2, the respective NPV's would be $13 million and $16 million. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 5.23.C. <T3>Energy Savings. </T3>As indicated above, standards will result in anincrease of gas consumption for small gas furnaces, but, also, in an overallsavings of natural gas. If, however, the marketplace continues to demandchanges in efficiency at the same rate as historically, the LBL-REM projectsthat there would be no savings from standards over the 1992-2015 period.This result occurs because in the base case, the efficiency, or SWEF, ofall new small gas furnaces is projected to exceed the 78 percent AFUE standardby the time it would come into effect. <T3>See </T3>Technical Support Document, Table 5.30, Reference 10.D. <T3>Lessening of Utility or Performance of Products. </T3>As indicatedabove, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that thestandards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performanceof small gas furnaces. In addition, DOE believes that none of the designoptions considered will affect utility.E. <T3>Impact of Lessening of Competition. </T3>The Department of Justiceconcluded that for small gas furnaces, the available evidence affirmativelysuggests that no significant adverse competitive impact is likely. DOE,therefore, concludes that none of the candidate standard levels would lessencompetition.F. <T3>Need of the Nation to Save Energy. </T3>Small gas furnaces use naturalgas as their energy source. Nearly 0.16 percent of the nation's naturalgas consumption is used to operate small gas furnaces, and nearly fourpercent of that 0.16 percent would be saved by standards for this productat level 3. However, the sensitivity analysis on the LBL-REM indicatesthat if consumer awareness of and concern with appliance efficiency continuesthe projected savings would be the same as with level 3 standards.Furthermore, the natural gas saved would result in a cumulative CO<T2>2</T2> emission savings in 2010 for standard level 3 of 312,000 tons,and 98,000 tons for level 1. Other environmental effects from furnace standardswould be savings in 2010 of 3,822 tons of SO<T2>2</T2> and 2,976 tons of NO<T2>2</T2> at standard level 3; at standard level 1, the savings wouldbe 1,200 tons of SO<T2>2</T2> and 927 tons of NO<T2>2</T2>.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Conclusion</ITAG>As noted above, the Act requires that, in establishing standards, the Departmentlook first at that standard that maximizes energy savings, i.e., is the``max tech'' level of efficiency for small gas furnaces, the ``max tech''level is at 97 percent AFUE.It was also noted above, however, that for this rulemaking, the Departmentis restricted in its consideration to an efficiency level between 71 percentAFUE and 78 percent AFUE. Therefore, the Department must begin its considerationfor a standard at that level that is the most stringent level allowed,i.e., 78 percent AFUE.After careful consideration of all the factors, the Department is establishinga 78 percent AFUE standard on small gas furnaces. This standard for smallgas furnaces will result in a significant conservation of energy, and itis technologically feasible and economically justified.In addition to producing the maximum unit energy savings of the candidatestandards, this standard is beneficial to consumers and manufacturers alike.The technology that would generally be used to meet this level of efficiency,i.e., induced draft combustion, is not only presently available, but italso will be installed on all other gas furnaces when this standard isto be effective.For consumers, the 78 percent AFUE standard produces the lowest consumerlife-cycle cost of the candidate levels. Furthermore, the standard's NPVof $21 million over the 1993-2015 period is the highest of the standardlevels analyzed. Also, the designs necessary to achieve that level of efficiency,i.e., induced draft combustion, should have no effect on utility to theconsumer.Also, the initial purchase price increase may be lower than that whichhas been estimated. This result is possible, because the 78 percent AFUEstandard on small gas furnaces is the same level of efficiency that theAct imposes on larger gas furnaces, which presently comprise more than95 percent of furnace sales. Therefore, to the extent that manufacturerscan produce these small units on the same production lines, with the samedesign options that will be used for the larger furnaces, there may beeconomies of scale in the production of these units.Small gas furnace manufacturers have strongly supported the 78 percentAFUE standard on their products. The analysis indicates that such a standardshould have relatively little economic impact on them. It is estimatedthat a 78 percent AFUE standard on small gas furnaces would cause the prototypicalgas furnace manufacturer to suffer a loss of .1 percent in its ROE. Theuniformity of a 78 percent AFUE standard on small furnaces and on largerunits, however, may make the production process simpler for the manufacturers.This occurs because, as mentioned above, a uniform standard for all gasfurnaces could result in fewer production lines.In addition, as noted above, the Attorney General has determined that thisstandard should not have a significant adverse effect on competition amongfurnace manufacturers.While the effects of a 78 percent AFUE standard are only slightly betterthan a 71 percent AFUE standard, the Department believes that the Act requiresthat the Department establish the most stringent standard that saves asignificant amount of energy, is technologically feasible, and is economicallyjustified. The 78 percent AFUE standard meets these requirements.In comments on the proposed rule, several gas utilities contended thata 78 percent AFUE standard on small gas furnaces would cause them to losemarket share to electric resistance heat. The analysis for this final rule,however, indicates that such a loss of market share is not a likely resultfrom a 78 percent AFUE standard. The LBL-REM projects that market sharefor small gas furnaces is likely to increase as a result of the level 3standard. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Table 5.20.One drawback to the 78 percent AFUE standard on small gas furnaces is thatit would eliminate units that may, in some circumstances, be the most cost-effectivefor some consumers. This is a result that could possible occur in someSouthern-tier States, where the most cost-effective small gas furnace couldbe one that is less efficient and whose first cost is less than that ofthe minimum LCC unit. Nevertheless, while this is a possible outcome forsome purchasers in some areas, the Department believes that such effects,should they occur at all, would be limited.Another possible drawback is that some installations, particularly of replacementfurnaces in some multi-family units could be somewhat complicated becauseof space limitations. The Department believes that these effects, too,would be limited, if they occur at all.Lastly, 78 percent AFUE standards, over the forecast period (1993-2015),are expected to save 4,818,000 tons of CO<T2>2</T2>, 65,112 tons of SO<T2>2</T2>, and 48,393 tons of NO<T2>2</T2> emissions.c. Television SetsThe Department received a number of comments concerning the engineeringanalysis for television sets. However, none of the comments included dataor sufficient information for the Department to consider. In order to respondto the comments, DOE believes an in-depth analysis of televisions wouldlikely need to be performed. And, since the data in a new analysis wouldbe new data that was not previously subject to comment, the Departmentbelieves a new analysis and proposed rule for television sets would haveto be published.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Environmental, Regulatory Impact, Takings Assessment, Federalismand Regulatory Flexibility Reviews</ITAG>The Department has reviewed today's final rule in accordance with the Department'sobligations under:andbullet; The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C.4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Council on Environmental Quality regulations implementingthe procedural provisions of NEPA (40 CFR part 1500 <T3>et seq.</T3>), and the Department's own NEPA guidelines (54 FR 49667,December 13, 1987);andbullet; Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193, February 19, 1981) which pertainsto agency review of the impact of Federal regulations;andbullet; Executive Order 12630 (53 FR 8859, March 18, 1988) which pertainsto agency consideration of Federal actions that interfere with constitutionallyprotected property rights;andbullet; Executive Order 12612 (54 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) which pertainsto agency consideration of Federal actions that would have a substantialdirect effect on States, on the relationship between the National Governmentand the States, and on the distribution of power and responsibility amongthe various levels of government; andandbullet; The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) which requires, in part, that an agency prepare a regulatoryflexibility analysis for any final rule unless it determines that the rulewill not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities.'' In the event that such an analysis is not required fora particular rule, the agency must publish a certification and explanationof that determination in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.a. Environmental ReviewIn issuing the proposed rule, the Department prepared an EnvironmentalAssessment (EA) (DOE/EA-0372) that was published within the Technical SupportDocument (DOE/CE-0239, November 1988). The environmental effects from differentpossible standard levels were found not to be significant, and a Findingof No Significant Impact (FONSI) was published along with the proposedrule. (53 FR 48826, December 2, 1988).In conducting the analysis for the final rule, the Department re-orderedthe refrigerator design options in order of increasing consumer paybackperiods, as noted above. As a result of this re-ordering, the environmentaleffects for the different refrigerator standard levels differ from thosereported in the EA. <T3>See</T3> Technical Support Document, Environmental Effects.Due to this re-ordering, and to greater efficiencies projected in the basecase, standard level 3 for refrigerators will result in slightly lesserreductions in carbon dioxide (CO<T2>2</T2>), sulfur dioxide (SO<T2>2</T2>), and nitrogen dioxide (NO<T2>2</T2>) than those projected in the EA for this level.In the proposed rule, the forecast period ended in the year 2010. The emissionssavings of CO<T2>2</T2> in that year for standard level 3 for refrigerators were estimatedto be 9.18 million tons, a reduction in emissions that was determined notto be significant.For the standard level being finalized in this rulemaking, the expectedCO<T2>2</T2> emissions savings in 2010 are 7.691 million tons, and, in theyear of the greatest savings, 2015, the emissions reductions are expectedto be 8.834 million tons. Both of these reductions in emissions are lowerthan the amount that was estimated for the proposed rule.For standard level 3 for refrigerators, the proposed rule's SO<T2>2</T2> and NO<T2>2</T2> emissions savings in 2010 were estimated to be 151,000 tonsand 100,000 tons, respectively. These reductions in SO<T2>2</T2> and NO<T2>2</T2> emissions were determined not to be significant.For the standard level being finalized in this rulemaking, the expectedreductions in SO<T2>2</T2> and NO<T2>2</T2> emissions in 2010 are 123,282 tons and 83,352 tons, respectively.In 2015, the year of the greatest expected reductions in SO<T2>2</T2> and NO<T2>2</T2> emissions, the savings are expected to total 126,365 tons and94,624 tons, respectively. The SO<T2>2</T2> and NO<T2>2</T2> emissions reductions expected in 2010 and in 2015 from thisfinal rule are lower than the amounts that were estimated for the proposedrule.The Department believes that these environmental impacts are not sufficientlylarge to be considered ``significant.'' These impacts fall within the rangeof impacts that were analyzed in the EA that was prepared for the proposedrule, and which were determined not to be significant in the FONSI thatwas issued for the proposed rule. Accordingly, DOE has determined thatthe impacts of re-ordering the refrigerator engineering design optionsare bounded by the analysis in the results of the EA, and that the originalFONSI is still valid.Furthermore, if the Clean Air Act Amendments that have been introducedin Congress were to become law, the amount of allowable powerplant emissionsof SO<T2>2</T2> and NO<T2>2</T2> in the year 2010 would be reduced from the amount otherwiseanticipated. The Department expects that there would be a correspondingdrop in emissions reductions caused by these appliance standards. Underthose conditions, the Department would expect that standard level 3 forrefrigerators would lead to reductions in emissions of 64,881 tons of SO<T2>2</T2>, and 62,013 tons of NO<T2>2</T2>. Each of these reductions is less than what would be expectedwithout the Clean Air Act Amendments, i.e., in the Department's forecastresults, presented above.The NRDC was critical of the Department's finding in the FONSI that theenvironmental effects that could result from appliance standards are notsignficant. The NRDC contended, in fact, that the expected environmentalbenefits are significant, and that the Department should have preparedan Environmental Impact Statement. (NRDC, No. 81, at 120-124). NRDC hasnot taken exception to DOE's forecasts of emissions reductions.The Department has determined that the environmental effects described,totaling less than 1 percent of U.S. powerplant emissions (for SO<T2>2</T2> and NO<T2>2</T2>) and less than one-half of 1 percent of U.S. emissions of CO<T2>2</T2> in the year 2015, are not significant, and do not require preparationof an Environmental Impact Statement. Nevertheless, as noted above, theenvironmental effects were considered in selecting the final standard forrefrigerators.b. Regulatory Impact ReviewExecutive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193, February 19, 1981) directs that, inissuing a major rule,\18\<NOTE/> an agency perform a regulatory analysis. Such an analysispresents major alternatives to the regulation that could substantiallyachieve the same regulatory goal at lower cost, as well as a descriptionof the costs and benefits (including potential net benefits) of the proposedapproach.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ ``Major rule'' means any regulation that is likely toresult in: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.DOE has determined that this rule is a ``major rule.'' Accordingly, a FinalRegulatory Impact Review has been prepared and submitted to the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB). OMB has reviewed the Regulatory Analysisunder Executive Order 12291.The Regulatory Analysis is summarized below. This summary focuses on themajor alternatives considered in arriving at the proposed approach to improvingthe energy efficiency of consumer products. The reader is referred to thecomplete final ``Regulatory Impact Analysis,'' which is contained in theTechnical Support Document, available as indicated at the beginning ofthis notice. It consists of: (1) A statement of the problem addressed bythis regulation, and the mandate for government action; (2) a descriptionand analysis of the feasible policy alternatives to this regulation; (3)a quantitative comparison of the impacts of the alternatives; and (4) theeconomic impact of the proposed approach.It should be noted at the outset that none of the alternatives that wereexamined for these products saved as much energy as the rule. Also, mostof the alternatives would require that enabling legislation be enacted,since authority to carry out those alternatives does not presently exist.<ITAG tagnum="81">Alternatives for Achieving Consumer Product Energy Conservation</ITAG>Six major alternatives were identified by DOE as representing feasiblepolicy alternatives for achieving consumer product energy efficiency. Thesealternatives include:andbullet; No New Regulatory Actionandbullet; Informational Action _Product labeling _Consumer educationandbullet; Prescriptive Standardsandbullet; Financial Incentives _Tax credits _Rebatesandbullet; Voluntary Energy Efficiency Targetsandbullet; The Proposed Approach (Performance Standards)Each alternative has been evaluated in terms of its ability to achievesignificant energy savings at reasonable costs and has been compared tothe effectiveness of the proposed approach.If no new regulatory action were taken, then no new standards would beimplemented for refrigerators or small gas furnaces. This is essentiallythe ``base case'' for each appliance. In this case, between the years 1992and 2015, there would be expected energy use of 44.09 Quads of primaryenergy, with no energy savings and a zero net present value.Several alternatives to the base case can be grouped under the headingof informational action. They include consumer product labeling and DOE'spublic education and information program. Both of these alternatives aremandated by the Act. One base case alternative would be to estimate theenergy conservation potential of enhancing these programs. To model thispossibility, the Department assumed that market discount rates would belowered by five percent for purchasers of these products. This resultedin no energy savings, with expected consumption equal to 44.09 Quads. Thenet present value is estimated to be $0.00.Another method of setting standards would entail requiring that certaindesign options be used on each product, i.e., prescriptive standards. Forrefrigerators, this involved assuming a 1.5 inch foam door and 5.0 EERcompressor (4.0 EER compressor for manual defrost units) and, for smallgas furnaces, a power burner. This resulted in energy consumption, between1992 and 2015, of 40.37 Quads, and savings of 3.71 Quads. The net presentvalue, in 1987 dollars, was $7.79 billion.Various financial incentive alternatives were tested. These included taxcredits and rebates to consumers, as well as tax credits to manufacturers.The tax credits to consumers were assumed to be 15 percent of the increasedcost of higher energy efficiency features of these appliances, while therebates were assumed to be 15 percent of the increase in equipment prices.The tax credits to consumers showed almost no change from the base case,i.e., this alternative would save less than 0.01 Quad with a net presentvalue of $80 million. Consumer rebates however, would save 0.05 Quad witha net present value of $260 million.The consumer rebate program and the tax credit program would return tothe participating consumer exactly the same amount of money. However, itis expected that there will be more participants in the rebate program.Therefore, the rebate program would result in substantially more energysavings than the tax credit program would.The most important differences to the consumer between rebate and tax creditprograms is that a rebate can be obtained quickly, whereas a tax creditis delayed until income taxes are filed or a tax refund is provided bythe Internal Revenue Service. This means that middle- and low-income purchasers,who generally have little ready cash to purchase more expensive products,are not as likely to take advantage of the program as are upper incomepurchasers. To simulate this impact, DOE has assumed that only 60 percentof consumers would purchase more energy efficient products as a resultof the tax credit program.Another financial incentive that was considered was tax credits to manufacturersfor the production of energy-efficient refrigerators and small gas furnaces.In this scenario, an investment tax credit (ITC) of 20 percent was assumed.The tax credits to manufacturers had almost no effect, since the energyconsumption estimates are 44.09 Quads with no energy savings, and a netpresent value equal to $30 million.The impact of this scenario is so small because the ITC was applicableonly to the tooling and machinery costs of the firms, i.e., the firms'fixed cost, and most of the design improvements that would likely be adoptedto manufacture more efficient versions of these products would involvepurchased parts. Expenses for purchased parts would not be eligible foran ITC.Two scenarios of voluntary energy efficiency targets were examined; inthe first one, energy conservation standards were assumed to be adoptedvoluntarily by all the relevant manufacturers in five years, and, in thesecond scenario, the standards were assumed to be adopted in 10 years.In these scenarios, the five year delay would result in energy consumptionby these appliances of 40.71 Quads, energy savings of 3.38 Quads, and anew present value of $5.69 billion; the 10 year delay would result in 42.27Quads of energy being consumed, 1.82 Quads being saved, and a net presentvalue of $3.43 million.These scenarios assume that there would be universal voluntary adoptionof the energy conservation standards by the refrigerator and small gasfurnace manufacturers, an assumption for which there is no reasonable assurance.Lastly, all of these alternatives must be gauged against the performancestandards that are being prescribed by this rule. Such performance standardswould result in energy consumption of refrigerators and small gas furnacesto total an estimated 38.89 Quads of primary energy over the 1992-2015time period. Savings would be 5.20 Quads, and the net present value wouldbe an expected $9.18 billion.As noted at the beginning of this section, none of the alternatives thatwere considered for refrigerators and small gas furnace would save as muchenergy as today's rule.c. Federalism ReviewExecutive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) requires that regulationsor rules be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on therelationship between the National Government and the States, or on thedistribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government.If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then Executive Order12612 requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in alldecisions involved in promulgating and implementing a regulation or a rule.DOE has identified a substantial direct effect that today's rule wouldhave on State governments. It would initially preempt inconsistent Stateregulations. However, DOE has concluded that the initially preemptive effectis not sufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment forthe following reason: the Act provides for subsequent State petitions forexemption, which necessarily means that the determination as to whethera State law prevails must be made on a case-by-case basis using criteriaset forth in the Act. When DOE receives such a petition, it will be appropriateto consider preparing a federalism assessment consistent with the criteriain the Act.d. Regulatory Flexibility ReviewThe Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-354) requires anassessment of the impact of regulations on small businesses. Small businessesare defined as those firms within an industry that are privately ownedand less dominant in the market.In this rulemaking, two different products and, hence, industries, arebeing addressed. Regulatory flexibility issues are addressed for the twoindustries for which standards are being finalized.First, the energy conservation standard of 78 percent AFUE on those smallgas furnace manufacturers, who could be considered small businesses, isdiscussed. There is no indication that the impact of standards will bedirectly related to firm size. Although different size firms have differentcost structures, industry sources indicate that, overall, neither largenor small firms have a cost advantage and that neither large nor smallfirms tend to have a higher proportion of fixed cost. A corollary to thisobservation is that profits are also not correlated to firm size. Somelarge firms are quite profitable, while others earn more modest profits,and the same is true for smaller firms.The Engineering Analysis indicates that the measures necessary to meetthe standards levels under consideration involve using additional purchasedparts which do not require development costs of the appliance manufacturer.While larger firms may have some slight cost advantage from buying in largerquantites, the fact that the design options predominantly involve purchasedparts tends to be an equalizing factor among different-sized firms.Therefore, the fact that this energy conservation standard on small gasfurnaces is not likely to ``have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities'' suggests that the provisions of section 605.(b)of the Regulatory Flexibility Act pertain. These provisions state thatneither an initial nor a final regulatory flexibility analysis need beperformed for a proposed or final rule ``if the head of the agency certifiesthat the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.''Of the eight small refrigerator firms reviewed for this analysis, threemake custom refrigerators, three make compact units (largely for mobilehomes and recreational vehicles), and two make 3-in-1 units with rangetops and sinks.The analysis of combined-unit manufacturers is straightforward. Three-in-oneunits are not covered by the present standards, so these manufacturerswill not be affected.The custom refrigerator manufacturers seem to be fairly well protectedfor two reasons; they are not exposed to either direct foreign competitionor direct competition from major domestic firms, and because they producecustom units they have a greater ability to make design changes comparedto a large manufacturer. These two facts indicate that standards will probablynot hurt the custom manufacturer's control of its market; however, itsmarket may shrink due to price increases. This cannot be estimated withoutengineering data and an estimate of the elasticity of demand in this market.One thing must be remembered when analyzing this problem: standards willincrease the price of standard refrigerators and this will offset (partlyor more than completely) the impact of the price increase of custom refrigerators.The three small manufacturers of compact refrigerators are probably atthe greatest risk, both without standards and from standards. They facestiff foreign competition from large foreign manufacturers.In conclusion, since neither of the standards is expected to have a ``significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities,'' the Departmenthas found that it was not necessary to prepare a regulatory flexibilityanalysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 430</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Energy consideration, Householdappliances.In consideration of the foregoing, part 430 of chapter II of title 10,Code of Federal Regulations, is amended as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, November 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.
