But Evans indicated Wednesday in the wake of his appointment aday earlier to one of the most prestigious posts in American bookpublishing that he harbors no ill will toward his old boss.   ``Now that I'm your publisher, you can be sure that your bookwill be published under me at Random House with maximum panache,''Evans said he wrote in a letter to Murdoch. ``And by the way, don'tpull any punches.''   Evans became editor at The Times, a British daily newspaper, inearly 1981 after 14 years as editor of The Sunday Times of London.   But he resigned in March 1982 after repeated disagreements withMurdoch over the political independence of the newspaper.   Murdoch is chief executive at News Corp. Ltd., which owns bothnewspapers as part of a media emprire that includes a movie studio,the Fox Television network, TV stations, newspapers and magazinesin the U.S.   Random House obtained the rights to publish Murdoch's memoirsonly recently, and Evans was named Tuesday as president andpublisher of the division of Random House that will publish thebook.   A spokesman for Murdoch did not return phone calls Wednesday forreaction to Evans' appointment and letter.   In a telephone interview, Evans said he plans to promoteMurdoch's book ``in a very big way.''   He described his departure from the Times as ``one littleincident.''   ``We both moved beyond those arguments of 10 years ago,'' hesaid.   Random House publishes about 120 books a year including works byauthors such as James Michener, Norman Mailer, William Styron andRobert Ludlum.   It is the nation's biggest publisher of general trade books,which include fiction and non-fiction for adult readers as well asbooks for children.   The book industry newsletter BP Report of Wilton, Conn.,estimates that Random House had $850 million in sales of generaltrade books in 1989, well ahead of second-place Bantam DoubledayDell at $595 million.   The company declined to comment on sales. It is owned by theprivately held Advance Publications Inc., controlled by theNewhouse family.   Evans, 62, was named president and publisher of the adultgeneral books division of Random House with responsibility for thatimprint as well as those of Villard Books and Times Books.   He replaces Joni Evans, 48, who had been publisher of the RandomHouse adult division since 1987 and will now found a new imprintfor the publishing company. Harold Evans and Joni Evans are notrelated.   Evans said he was approached about taking the new job in thepast week or two after Joni Evans persisted with her longstandingdesire to start her own book imprint.   Harold Evans will become executive vice president of RandomHouse, a post which Ms. Evans retains as well.   Harold Evans comes to the new job from another Newhouse company,Conde Nast Publications, where he was founding editor in chief ofConde Nast Traveler magazine. That publication has won plauditsfrom media critics for occasionally publishing stories critical ofpotential advertisers.   After leaving The Times of London in 1982, Evans was editor inchief at The Atlantic Monthly Press and editorial directoe of U.S.News andamp; World Report from 1984-86. He helped found Conde NastTraveler in 1986.   He is married to Tina Brown, editor of Conde Nast's Vanity Fairmagazine.</TEXT></DOC>
