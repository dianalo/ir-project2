If anything, the two Kunnming factory workers who hijacked one of China's commercial airliners May 12 and flew to Taiwan have given Taipei a headache.    In its war of words with Beijing, Taipei always considers it a propaganda coup when defectors from China seek refuge in Taiwan. But the hijacking, the first directly from China to Taiwan, comes as Taipei's policy toward Beijing is in a state of confusion. The hostile rhetoric remains, but the old rules don't apply.    Indirect trade and investment are booming. Since Taipei lifted a travel ban in November, residents of Taiwan have flooded into China to visit relatives. And analysts say government officials worry that giving refuge to hijackers could put Taiwan in a league with outlaw nations such as Libya and Iran. So the government scrambled to save face.    The usual hero's welcome accorded to those who have fled the mainland was toned down. Officials hailed the hijackers as &quot;freedom seekers,&quot; and a news conference was scheduled to introduce them to the press. But President Lee Teng-hui abruptly canceled their appearance, leaving government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming to brave his way through an explanation.    He said the government warmly welcomed the hijackers, who were absent because they needed to catch up on sleep. Asked if Taiwan would abide by three international air-piracy treaties it has signed -- all of which require the immediate prosecution or extradition of hijackers -- Mr. Shaw said extradition to China was out of the question. As for prosecution, he said, &quot;All options are under consideration.&quot;    Meanwhile, pictures of the two hijackers smiling in front of a portrait of Taiwan's late president, Chiang Ching-kuo, were handed out in the back of the room.    &quot;The government knows it has a hot potato in its hands,&quot; says Lu Ya-li, a Taiwan University political-science professor. &quot;On the one hand, they can't send the hijackers back. On the other hand, we have to improve our image.&quot;    The hijackers also landed in the middle of a controversy over the actions of previous defectors. Since 1961, 11 Chinese Air Force pilots have landed in Taiwan and been given asylum. They have been lavished with as much as $2 million in gold, jobs and chances to attend universities. Private groups connected to the government gave similar treatment to the only other Chinese airplane hijackers to reach Taiwan (via South Korea, in 1984).    But newspapers have charged that one of the defectors left China to escape his wife, not communism, and a plea by another for more gold created a stir. Earlier this month, Taiwan's vice minister of defense publicly denounced some of the former pilots for chasing women and squandering their money.    &quot;Public opinion has changed,&quot; says Antonio Chiang, publisher of Taiwan's leading political magazine. &quot;During the cold war, this was good propaganda. Now it's an embarrassment.&quot;    The Taipei district prosecutor got the two hijackers' case to consider last weekend. But government radio quoted a prosecution official as saying that the hijackers &quot;will be treated leniently&quot; if they are taken to court. Instead of being arrested, the hijackers, both 26 years old, were put up in a Taipei mansion owned by a government-linked anti-communist association.    (Wu Rongnan, director-general of Xiamen Aviation Co., which operated the hijacked plane, demanded that Taiwan punish the two defectors, according to newswire reports of an article in China's official newspaper, the People's Daily. The newspaper said Mr. Wu told a news conference that the hijackers deserved severe punishment because they &quot;used force to threaten the plane's crew and passengers and caused the plane to exceed its speed limit, triggering violent shaking of the plane.&quot;)    Political analysts say the hijackers may be given a perfunctory trial and suspended sentences. The analysts say Taiwan can avoid criticism of this soft treatment by claiming that the airplane never left domestic airspace, so international air-piracy agreements don't apply. Since fleeing to Taiwan in 1949, Taiwan's Kuomintang government has claimed sovereignty over mainland China.    A U.S. political analyst based in Taiwan says one aspect of last week's hijacking may represent an improvement in relations between Taipei and Beijing.    In 1986, when a pilot with Taiwan's China Airlines flew his Boeing 747 cargo jet to Canton and defected to China, it took two weeks of difficult negotiations to get the plane returned to Taiwan.    In this case, the plane -- a Civil Aviation Administration of China Boeing 737 -- was sent back to China less than six hours after the remaining 116 passengers and crew members were fed a midnight snack by the Taiwan government. &quot;This case marks an improvement, not a step backwards,&quot; the analyst said. </TEXT></DOC>
