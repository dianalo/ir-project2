U.S. officials say they do not expect May's planned Sino-Sovietsummit _ the first such meeting in 30 years _ to produce a similarstrategic shift in the superpower security equation.   They say Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's bear hug inBeijing with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping will not be a diplomaticsetback for the United States, whose commercial and academic tieswith Beijing are steadily improving.   The Americans have ample reason to be confident.   China has made it clear there will be no backtracking to the1950s, when Beijing was a junior partner in Moscow's bid to lead aunified and expanding Communist bloc.   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, in a statement on summitpreparatory talks last week, stressed China's ``independent foreignpolicy of peace'' and said the expected normalization ofChinese-Soviet relations ``should not prejudice their respectiverelations with other countries.''   Gorbachev presented his appeal to end the years of mistrustbetween the Communist giants in a 1986 speech that offeredcompromises on territorial disputes. The Soviets later cut troops inSoviet ally Mongolia and along the border.   The Chinese have slowly responded to the Soviet overtures, andthey have rejected Gorbachev's proposal for an Asian-Pacificconference on regional security, which would give Moscow more say inregional affairs.   Instead, the Chinese have actively sought to improve relationswith Thailand and other nations of Southeast Asia and the SouthernPacific, partly to counter Soviet links to Vietnam and its designsfor a greater presence in the region.   China also remains firmly committed to the West for trade, aidand technology.   Soviet trade with China is now 10 times the 1981 figure of $260million, but that pales with China's $12 billion trade with theUnited States last year and more than $3 billion U.S. investment inChinese industry.   Japan provides more than $1 billion in loans to China annually,and had bilateral trade worth $15.6 billion last year.   China last year sent 445 students and scholars to the SovietUnion. There are more than 30,000 Chinese studying in the UnitedStates.   Except for the brief honeymoon after the Chinese Communists cameto power in 1949, relations between Asia's two largest nations havetraditionally been shaky. Territorial disputes go back to the daysof Czarist Russia.   After a brief border war in 1969, the Soviet ``hegemonists''became China's No. 1 enemy, and more than 1 million troops massed oneach side of the 5,000-mile border.   Even as the summit approaches, China continues to view the Sovietardor for rapprochement with suspicion and caution.   When visiting Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze talkedeffusively last week of a ``complete normalization'' of relations,Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei balked at the word``complete.''   ``I don't want to use any adjectives,'' he said.   Relations have already improved dramatically in recent yearsbetween China and the Soviet bloc nations of Eastern Europe. Chinaand Mongolia have also begun to restore long-strained ties.   Now that Moscow and Beijing are talking, they may cooperate morein ending the 36-year stalemate on the Korean Peninsula, where theyare both allies to North Korea, and in resolving the conflict inCambodia, where they back opposing sides.   The two sides have begun talks on easing military tensions alongthe border.   Although they face vastly different problems, the Sovietpurveyors of perestroika, or economic restructuring, can learn muchfrom China's travails of inflation and shortages after 10 years ofeconomic reforms.   China, which has lagged behind in political reforms, is watchingSoviet flirtations with democracy.   Shevardnadze spoke of greater exchanges in trade, science,controlling the environment and exploring outer space.   Barter trade across the border is booming, tourist exchanges havebegun and next year the second Trans-Siberian railway, a linethrough western China first envisioned in the 1950s, is to becompleted.   ``Soviet-Chinese relations have reached this point notautomatically and not by chance,'' Shevardnadze said. ``Both sideswanted it to happen.''</TEXT></DOC>
