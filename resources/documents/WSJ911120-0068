The efforts persisted even after international sanctionswere imposed on Iraq because of its invasion of Kuwait inAugust 1990, law enforcement officials said.</LP><TEXT>   Prosecutors and customs agents in Miami and Philadelphiaare gathering evidence they contend indicates that Mr.Cardoen and associates evaded U.S. export laws, according tothese officials. The investigators believe the scheme usedSouth African, Spanish and other firms as intermediaries tosupply Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein with parts for artilleryshells and other military equipment through the 1980s.   The investigators allege that shipments were made throughsome countries without proper U.S. export licenses. In othercases, they say, shipments were made to South Africa inviolation of U.S. laws and United Nations prohibitionsagainst supplying military hardware to that country.   In 1988, according to documents filed by prosecutors infederal court in Philadelphia, one of Mr. Cardoen's firmsparticipated in a $33 million deal in which a major SouthAfrican defense electronics company allegedly was to smuggleU.S. bomb fuses to Iraq in exchange for oil. Law enforcementofficials said they also have gathered documents andtestimony showing that the Chilean industrialist worked withU.S., South African and other firms in alleged schemes to tryto sell Iraq military goods ranging from helicopters tofuel-air bombs after the invasion of Kuwait.   The investigation, among other things, ties Mr. Cardoen'sbusiness empire, Industrias Cardoen S.A., to companiescontrolled by James Guerin, a former major U.S. arms-dealeraccused of masterminding a $1 billion swindle that includedillicit sales of missile-guidance parts, optical equipmentand other battlefield gear for use by South Africa'sgovernment-owned armaments company. Investigators havealleged that Iraq also was the destination for some of Mr.Guerin's deliveries.   As part of the probe, investigators are trying todetermine if retired Pakistani Gen. Talat Masood, untilseveral months ago that country's top arms-procurementofficial, received $250,000 in a Swiss bank account to helphide Mr. Guerin's schemes in the late 1980s. Gen. Masoodcouldn't be reached for comment.   Miami Assistant U.S. Attorney Eduardo Palmer, theprosecutor in charge of the Cardoen investigation, declinedto comment, as did prosecutors in Philadelphia who aresupervising the related inquiry involving Mr. Guerin andPakistan.   Roberto Martinez, Mr. Cardoen's attorney, declined torespond to questions. But documents filed by Mr. Martinez inDallas federal district court contend that various U.S.officials visited Mr. Cardoen's facilities and were aware ofhis arms-selling activities, especially his efforts to marketoverseas a version of a helicopter manufactured by a TextronInc. unit.   In the past, Mr. Cardoen and his spokesman acknowledgedhaving dealings with Iraq, but they denied violating any lawsand said that sales to that country ceased last year afterthe U.N. imposed an embargo on sales to it.   While earlier press reports mentioned that a criminalinvestigation of Mr. Cardoen's activities had been started,law enforcement officials said that the grand jury probe wasstepped up recently, and prosecutors now have been authorizedby their superiors to seek wide-ranging criminal charges,perhaps by early next year.   With his web of offshore companies and plants from SouthAmerica to Greece and Iraq, investigators said, Mr. Cardoenwas in a perfect position to funnel a wide range of Westerntechnology to Iraq and other parts of the Middle East.   Messrs. Cardoen and Guerin are both considered &quot;majorleague international arms dealers,&quot; according to JohnHensley, the head of enforcement for the Customs Service.Investigators believe the two men joined forces on some dealsinvolving South Africa, Iraq and other Middle Eastern states.   The two also reached an agreement, according to one personinvolved in the case, about certain countries where theywouldn't try to compete against each other in marketingcluster bombs.   Pretoria has declined to comment on the allegations, eventhough its government-owned weapons firm was indicted a fewweeks ago by a Philadelphia grand jury on arms-smugglingcharges stemming from its involvement with Mr. Guerin.   Mr. Guerin agreed months ago to plead guilty to variousfelonies and cooperate with prosecutors. Law enforcementofficials said he has described meeting with Mr. Cardoen andadmitted, among other things, using one of the Chileanindustrialist's plants in a ruse to book more than $460million in bogus missile business with Pakistan. Prosecutorsallege Mr. Guerin used the phony contract to inflate thevalue of his principal company.   When outside auditors and others became suspicious in thespring of 1989, according to the indictment, Mr. Guerinarranged a meeting to have &quot;a general&quot; in the Pakistani army&quot;vouch for the validity of the phony&quot; contract. Lawenforcement officials said Gen. Masood is the person referredto in the indictment, but he hasn't been charged with anycrime.   The flamboyant, U.S.-educated Mr. Cardoen -- whoseinterests in Chile are said to include ranching, textiles andother nonmilitary holdings -- has been watched by the CentralIntelligence Agency for years. As early as 1984, according toa report by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the CIAbelieved Mr. Cardoen &quot;was the primary supplier of clusterbombs for the Iraqi government&quot; and an &quot;important supplier&quot;of other munitions throughout the Middle East.</TEXT></DOC>
