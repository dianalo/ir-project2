As aresult, the total amount of oil to be made available isexpected to be 50% to 75% of the 2.5 million barrelsoriginally envisioned.   Energy Secretary James Watkins said that in cutting thesize of the auction, the U.S. tried &quot;to ensure that our salereflects genuine market needs while, at the same time,satisfying crude oil buyers that the government is a reliablesupplier at fair market prices.&quot;   The department accepted bids for 14.35 million barrels oflow-sulfur, or sweet, crude and 2.95 million barrels of sour,or high-sulfur, crude. The department increased the amount oflow-sulfur crude and slashed the amount of high-sulfur oil itis selling in response to the strong industry preference forsweet crude.   The department said it expects most of the crude to bedelivered to purchasers in late February and early March.Actual purchase prices may be adjusted to reflect changes inmarket prices.
