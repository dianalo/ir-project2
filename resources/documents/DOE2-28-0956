Certainly, such negotiationscan play an important part in reducing NATO's reliance on the early firstuse of nuclear weapons in response to aggression, as well as perhapsallowing for some fiscal relief. On November 2, 1987, agreement in principlewas in fact reached in Vienna to begin what NATO terms conventional stabilitytalks in 1988. These negotiations, which will cover the whole of Europefrom the Atlantic to the Urals, presumably would absorb the 14-year-oldand moribund Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction (MBFR) negotiations,which were limited to negotiations on common manpower ceilings in CentralEurope. Results in the new force stability talks, however, are likelyto prove painfully slow in emerging - if the negotiations bear fruitat all. The author discusses new ideas for confidence- and security-buildingmeasures, intended to reduce the risk of war in Europe, by keeping thetwo blocs well informed of each other's military activities.</TEXT></DOC>
