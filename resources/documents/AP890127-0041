Enrique Gorriaran Merlo directed the attack Monday on the 3rdInfantry Regiment base in the western suburb of La Tablada thatresulted in the death of 38 people, government and security sourcessaid Thursday.   Gorriaran Merlo, 47, once led the now-defunct People'sRevolutionary Army, which openly battled the military after it tookpower in a 1976 coup. He is believed to have escaped during a27-hour siege in which army and police forces retook the base, thesources said on condition of anonymity.   Among the dead were eight soldiers and two policemen. One of thepolicemen died Thursday of wounds suffered in the assault. About 70others were wounded.   But Gorriaran Merlo was not thought to be among the bodies of 14armed civilians who remain unidentified, the sources said.   The disclosure came as authorities probed links between theattackers and left-wing organizations. The government claims theassailants were leftist subversives.   Police on Thursday raided several houses in Mar del Plata, 250miles south of Buenos Aires, and arrested three people but gave noother details.   Gorriaran Merlo, a stocky former architecture student, wasinvolved in the Marxist People's Revolutionary Army, which wasdecimated in the late 1970s during a harsh anti-subversion campaignwaged by the military leaders.   Gorriaran Merlo, however, escaped and went to Nicaragua. Inpublished interviews, he said he led a team of Argentine andNicaraguan guerrillas who assassinated Somoza in 1980 on a street inthe Paraguayan capital of Asuncion. Somoza had been ousted byNicaragua's leftist Sandinistas in 1979.   President Raul Alfonsin ordered the prosecution of GorriaranMerlo shortly after taking office in December 1983. Alfonsin'selection ended nearly eight years of military dictatorship.   Gorriaran Merlo was believed to be living abroad. Last year, aleftist human rights lawyer, Jorge Banos, asked the courts to allowGorriaran Merlo to return and face trial without being imprisoned.   Police said among those killed in this week's assault was Banos.He and at least two other attackers whose names have been releasedby police were active in a leftist political group, the Everyone forthe Country Movement.   The little-known movement, formed about three years ago,denounced earlier this month what it said were plans for a coup byright-wing extremists in the armed forces. Those elements have ledthree dramatic but short-lived insurrections against Alfonsin sinceApril 1987.   The army base's attackers carried a written proclamation thatsaid their action was designed to stop a coup and foment civilianresistance to the military.   The incident surprised and chilled Argentines, and promptedAlfonsin to set up a National Security Council to evaluate andcurtail the threat of subversion.   The group, composed of the chiefs of the military branches andseveral government ministers, met for the first time Thursday.Alfonsin presided. No details were provided.   The centrist Radical government, with an eye to the excessescommitted by the military during its so-called ``dirty war'' againstsubversion in the 1970s, until now has barred the military from amajor role in internal security.   Human rights groups already have said they fear militaryparticipation might mean a return to the deadly anti-leftistrepression of last decade, when at least 8,900 people were arrestedand vanished without a trace. They are presumed executed.   The Buenos Aires daily newspaper Clarin, quoting governmentsources, said Alfonsin's decree gives military intelligence agenciesauthority to conduct domestic surveillance _ which previously wasillegal.</TEXT></DOC>
