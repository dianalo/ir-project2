Currently, commercial AMR systems for thegas industry are based on one of two technologies: radio frequency (RF)and telephone. The development of long-life lithium batteries and low-powerconsumption circuits have eliminated many of the obstacles that retardedthe development of AMR systems. There are two manufacturers of RF-basedsystems and six manufacturers of telephone-based systems in the UnitedStates. There are also two telephone-based Japanese systems, but thereare not marketed in the United States. The units are relatively easyto install and generally cost between $55 and $75. Fiber optics is athird potential communication link for either AMR systems or SCADA (SupervisoryControl and Data Acqusition) systems. There are two primary advantagesto fiber optics: (1) they are safe because data are carried as lightbeams and (2) fibers can carry an enormous amount of data in a small-diametercable. Three scenarios for fiber optic installations are described inthis paper.</TEXT></DOC>
