(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A dispute at Georgia's Republican conventioncould leave the state with two competing delegations to the GOP'snational convention in New Orleans this summer.   Atlanta lawyer Matt Patton took the podium at the conventionthis weekend after an angry walkout by GOP Chairman John Stuckey,who adjourned the meeting and left along with several hundred partyregulars.   The more than 900 Republicans who remained elected Patton topreside and continued the convention on their own, adopting a partyplatform and electing 18 at-large delegates to the NationalRepublican Convention.   Stuckey said he would convene a meeting of the party's stateexecutive committee to select the official at-large delegates,leaving open the possibility of two Georgia delegations. Thirtyother GOP delegates were already picked at district conventions.   Stuckey had presided Friday over an abbreviated session markedby chanting and booing by many of the 968 delegates _ mostly PatRobertson supporters and newcomers to party politics _ who had beendisqualified by the party regulars' credentials committee.   The credentials committee, complying with a court order,considered and granted appeals by many of the disqualifieddelegates Friday evening and, on Saturday, party officials beganthe lengthy process of registering the official delegates.   But Stuckey adjourned the convention, saying it had been takenover by what he described as an unruly mob. He told reporters thecourt rulings would be appealed to the state's highest court and,if necessary, the U.S. Supreme Court.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Cuomo Predicts a Dukakis Landslide</HEAD><DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y.

Mario Cuomo says DemocratMichael Dukakis would win the November presidential election by ``alandslide'' and Vice President George Bush might even bow out ofthe race.   ``It's totally improbable,'' said Cuomo of a possible withdrawalby Bush before the Republican convention in August, ``but Iwouldn't rule it out.''   ``He (Bush) looks so weak anything could happen,'' said Cuomo.   Cuomo, referring to national polls and continuing politicalproblems for the vice president, said, ``If I were Bush I'd beconcerned.''   On the other hand, the New York governor said he was impressedby Dukakis' ``superb campaign.''   ``It's not going to be a victory. It's going to be alandslide,'' Cuomo said.

Cuomo has said he will make his endorsementafter the primaries end on June 7, and that his endorsement will goto the front-runner at that point.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Poll Shows South Carolinians Support Bush Over Dukakis</HEAD><DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C.
