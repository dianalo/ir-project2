Justice Harry A. Blackmun refused to reinstate an anti-strikeinjunction that was lifted on Sept. 30 by the 8th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals based in St. Louis.   Burlington Northern said the appeals court order could meanstrike activities will be resumed against the railroad pendingfurther court appeals in a dispute between the railroad and theUnited Transportation Union.   The dispute was triggered by Burlington Northern's plan to sella section of its line in Montana and Idaho to the Montana RailLink, a new corporation.   This type of transaction recently was exempted from review bythe Interstate Commerce Commission.   The union threatened to strike after failing to block the saleor get the railroad to negotiate over the planned sale.   The 8th Circuit court last May refused to enjoin the union fromstriking, but that ruling did not take effect until Sept. 30.</TEXT></DOC>
