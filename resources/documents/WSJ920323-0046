Vietnam may start borrowing again from the World Bank andthe International Monetary Fund as soon as it repays about$140 million in arrears to the IMF, said the official,Callisto Madavo.   Meanwhile, the World Bank is &quot;extremely encouraged by whatVietnam has done in policy reforms with very little externalsupport,&quot; he said. &quot;It's moving from a command economy to amarket economy. And it has the resource base, theentrepreneurial drive and the talent to succeed. We'retalking about a country with 90% literacy.&quot;   As its economic reforms bear fruit, Hanoi could getincreasing amounts of aid from Australia, Italy and theNordic countries, Mr. Madavo said.                                                                                                          BRAZIL ENVIRONMENT CHIEF AXED                                                                                                          Brazil's President Fernando Collor de Mello firedEnvironment Secretary Jose Lutzenberger, whose speechescondemning Amazon destruction delighted conservationistsabroad but made him enemies at home. The decision came lessthan three months before Brazil is due to host the giantUnited Nations &quot;Earth Summit&quot; in Rio de Janeiro. Thedismissal follows a row last week when Mr. Lutzenbergeraccused the nation's environmental agency of acting as a&quot;subsidiary of the timber industry.&quot; He will be succeeded byEducation Secretary Jose Goldemberg, a Collor ally.                                                                                                          WESTERN GERMANY'S TRADE GAP                                                                                                          Western Germany, which was one of the world's mightiestexporters before German unification, swung to a merchandisetrade deficit of 408 million marks ($244.1 million) inJanuary from a surplus of 4.1 billion marks in December.Eastern Germany's trade surplus shrank to 458 million marksfrom 1 billion marks. The data aren't adjusted for inflation.The unified German trade surplus plunged to 50 million marksfrom 5.1 billion marks.                                                                                                          U.K.'S INFLATION RATE DISAPPOINTS                                                                                                          Britain's inflation rate remained stuck at 4.1% inFebruary, disappointing some economists who had forecast adecline to as low as 3.8% from a year earlier. The datadeprived the Conservative government of fresh ammunition forits April 9 election campaign, though Prime Minister JohnMajor said recent British price stability is &quot;remarkable in away not seen for many years.&quot; Other measures showedunderlying inflation, which excludes mortgage interest, at5.6%, also unchanged from January. The static performanceresulted partly from a rebound in many retail prices oncepost-Christmas sales ended.

The European Community Shipowners'Association in November 1989 complained that the harborcharges, ostensibly aimed at guaranteeing a constant supplyof dockworkers, were illicitly used to improve thedistribution network for Japan's imports and didn't benefitEC shippers.

The measures were imposed Fridayto battle ozone pollution levels that had soared to more thanthree times the health-safety limit. In the smog-chokedcity's worst environmental alert on record, the city hadalready ordered a 30% cut in industrial activity, halved thenumber of government vehicles on the roads, suspended streetwork, and even closed schools for a day.                                                                                                          SPAIN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH OUTLOOK                                                                                                          Spain will have strong economic growth and reducedunemployment through next year if it caps inflation andtightens its budget, the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development said.   The OECD, an economic forum of rich industrial nations,praised Spain for cooling its overheated economy last yearand predicted a gradual pickup in activity. Economic growth,2.5% in 1991, is expected to expand to 2.8% this year and to3.3% in 1993. Unemployment, 16% in 1991, is seen retreatingto 15.75% this year and easing further in 1993 to 15.25%, asthe quickening pace of the economy boosts job creation.   But the OECD warned that the key to Spain's continuedgrowth lies in reining in wage increases and dampinginflation by opening the sheltered service sector tocompetition.   The group said its projections &quot;depend on the assumptionsof wage moderation, greater emphasis on efficiency gains bycompanies, and the curbing of excessive profit margins inservice sectors.&quot;                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .
