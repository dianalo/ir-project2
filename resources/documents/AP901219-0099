The sanctions would have limited U.S. imports of Norwegian fishproducts.   ``We're very pleased with the president's decision,'' saidIngvard Havnen, press counselor at the Norwegian Embassy.   Earlier, Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher found thatNorway's whaling practices were hindering international efforts topreserve whales. Such a ruling would normally result in sanctionsagainst the offending country. But in a letter to leaders ofCongress, Bush wrote:   ``Norway has made improvements in the design of its researchprogram in each year and a reduction in the take of whales from 68to five North Atlantic minke whales. ...
