Capt. Philippe Legorjus, chief of the French anti-terrorismforce in this French-held territory, was released from a cave onthe island of Ouvea and told to pursue negotiations with Frenchauthorities, official sources in Noumea said.   They threatened to kill their remaining hostages if he did notreturn to the rebel hideaway, a system of caves 110 miles north ofhere.   Legorus, five police officers and an assistant prosecutor wereseized by the Melanesian separatists Wednesday as they sought tonegotiate the release of 15 other lawmen who had been kidnapped onApril 22.   The initial hostages were among 27 people kidnapped in a bloodyattack at a police station that left four gendarmes dead. Twelve ofthose hostages subsequently were freed.   The attack was part of widespread violence aimed at haltingSunday's French presidential elections on the island.   Police said all the remaining hostages are being held in theOuvea caves.   The Melanesian separatists, known as Kanaks, released Legorjusto negotiate with French authorities in Fayaoue, a village onOuvea. Legorjus made at least one trip by helicopter from the caveon Thursday.   ``When you open talks, you take risks,'' Defense Minister AndreGiraud, responsible for order in the Pacific archipelego, said inParis.   Meanwhile, Bernard Pons, minister for overseas territories, saidin Noumea that he has asked the government to outlaw the KanakSocialist Liberation Front, which is seeking New Caledonia'sindependence from France.   ``It appears now that there is collusion between terrorist actscarried out in certain parts of the territory, including the takingof hostages on Ouvea, and the (Kanak political group),'' Pons said.   Membership in a banned group is a crime under French law.   In Paris, Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac referred to theKanak front as a ``terrorist faction'' that does not represent theNew Caledonian population.   ``I will do everything so that this group is reduced,'' he saidduring a televised debate with Socialist President FrancoisMitterrand, his rival in presidential run-off elections May 8.   ``What counts today is the liberation of the gendarmes andjudicial offical,'' Mitterrand said. ``But what counts tomorrow isdialogue.''   Chirac did not clearly say whether he supported outlawing thefront.   Such a ban must be voted by the Cabinet, which meets againWednesday. Mitterrand would have to sign the decree to make it law.   Yeiwene Yeiwene, the No. 2 leader in the Kanak political group,said banning the organization ``would not settle the crisis in NewCaledonia and will not stop the Kanak people from taking the fightfor independence to its end.''   Since Friday last week, election-related violence has left sixpeople dead on New Caledonia and at least 10 wounded.   Native Melanesians make up 43 percent of the population of145,000, while 36 percent are Europeans and the rest primarilyAsian or Tahitian.   Many Kanaks desire independence, while most Europeans wish toretain ties to France.   An estimated 4,000 French troops and gendarmes are in NewCaledonia.   A French police officer was shot Thursday near Canala on theeast coast of the mainland, according to the national policeheadquarters in Paris. He was listed in good condition at a Noumeahospital.   The kidnappers have demanded the removal of policereinforcements from the islands. They asked that mediators be sentfrom Paris to discuss a new referendum on self-determination.</TEXT></DOC>
