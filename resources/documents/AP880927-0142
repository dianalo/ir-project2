Police said they were unable to compile a casualty report fromthe 10-minute raid by two jet fighters on bases of Hezbollah, orParty of God, in pine woods near the Christian town of Jezzine.   Hezbollah gunners opened up with anti-aircraft guns as the jetsstaged their dive-bombing sorties at 11:30 a.m. on targets about 30miles south of Beirut. There were no hits, police said.   In Jerusalem, the Israeli command said the target of the strikewas a guerrilla base in a Shiite area near the village ofal-Luwayzah, 10 miles north of the Christian town of Marjayoun.   Marjayoun is the provincial capital of a border ``securityzone'' Israel carved out in south Lebanon in 1985 to serve as abuffer against cross-border guerrilla forays.   Smoke billowed from the stricken bases just outside the zone asHezbollah gunmen sealed off the woods west of Jezzine, preventingpolice patrols from taking stock of the losses, said a policespokesman who cannot be named under standing rules.   Hezbollah is made up of Shiite zealots backed by the IslamicRepublic of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. They have long been wagingguerrilla attacks on Israel's self-proclaimed security zone.   Jezzine is the northern-most position manned by theIsraeli-sponsored south Lebanon army militia, which patrols thesix-to-10-mile zone.   The last previous Israeli air raid was on Friday, when jetsraided Palestine Liberation Organization bases near the southernport city of Sidon, killing three guerrillas and wounding five.   That brought to 68 people killed and 108 wounded the overalltoll from Israel's 14 air strikes since Jan. 3.</TEXT></DOC>
