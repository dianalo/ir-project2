Various geophysical and geomechanical methods of fieldmeasurements will be used to obtain the experimental data base for anumerical analysis of critical stresses. Finite element calculationsare used to precalculate the temperatures, strains, and stresses, toestablish design criteria for this experiment, and for comparison withthe measurements. These investigations will be also used for improvingand verifying of numerical models used in the thermomechanical calculations.7 refs.; 10 figs. refs.</TEXT></DOC>
