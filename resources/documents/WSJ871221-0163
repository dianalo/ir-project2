Units---By Teri AginsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BAIR PN LABORTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)AIRLINES (AIR) </IN><TEXT>   Braniff Inc. Chairman Jay A. Pritzker, trying to nail down union concessions, is preparing to revise his Pan American World Airways merger proposal to include at least two other Pan Am Corp. units, the Pan Am Shuttle Inc. and Pan Am Express, a commuter airline.    Sources close to the negotiations say Braniff will need to acquire the other Pan Am airline units in order to obtain $200 million in annual cost concessions for four years from Pan Am's unions. While leaders of four of the airline's five unions met with Mr. Pritzker and representatives of Dallas-based Braniff last week, the unions have failed to grant concessions to Mr. Pritzker, in part because they are seeking to keep the New York-based airline company intact.    Mr. Pritzker left New York Thursday after discussing with Air Line Pilots Association leaders his proposed concessions package. Union leaders said Mr. Pritzker left it up to them to determine how to put together the $70 million in concessions, which the Braniff chairman said the merged company will require annually for four years.    Pan Am directors are scheduled to meet tomorrow, when sources close to the talks expect that Braniff's planned revisions to its merger proposal will be discussed. While Pan Am's directors have been split over the sale of the company, industry observers believe that they will have little choice but to consider a revised proposal from Braniff if Braniff obtains the concessions. &quot;If Pritzker is able to come in on Tuesday with $70 million of concessions from ALPA at least, then the board will be forced to consider selling the rest of the company to him,&quot; one source close to the negotiations said.    Under the current proposal, approved by Pan Am's directors and endorsed by management, Braniff would be merged with Pan American World Airways, which would be spun off from its parent. Pan Am Corp. would retain its shuttle, Pan Am Express, and World Services units. The World Services unit, which provides ground services to military and commercial installations, wasn't included in the current discussions, a union source said.    Current Pan Am Corp. shareholders would receive 55% of the new company's shares and Braniff shareholders would receive 45%, of which Braniff would be expected to keep 25% and give 20% to the unions in exchange for cost concessions. The sources said that in a revised proposal Braniff would probably take a smaller portion of the new company in order to pay for the other airline units.    Wall Street analysts as well as Pan Am union leaders have said that the merged company would benefit from both the shuttle and Pan Am Express, profitable units that would provide a domestic traffic feed to the airline's international structure. &quot;The company as a whole works better if you keep both components together,&quot; one union source said.    As previously reported, Pan Am's 21,500 employees received a letter from management last week recommending that they give concessions to Braniff. The letter was signed by both Pan Am Chairman C. Edward Acker, who has supported the spinoff, and Vice Chairman Martin Shugrue Jr., who has been fighting it. Pan Am insiders say that the strain between the two has continued and one Pan Am official said that Mr. Shugrue signed the letter &quot;under duress&quot; in an attempt to present a united front to employees.    Whether or not Pan Am directors go along with any revised proposal, Pan Am insiders believe that the board will be confronted in coming weeks with problems created by the rift on the board. &quot;Both Acker and Shugrue have lost all credibility with the unions and that means that they will never really be effective in running the company,&quot; a union source said.    Analysts have recently estimated that Pan Am will close the year with losses as high as $90 million, and the company is in the midst of the unprofitable winter season without labor concessions needed to bring its cost structure under control. One analyst expects the company to face a critical cash squeeze in the first quarter of 1988.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Pan Am closed at $3.25, unchanged. In over-the-counter trading, Braniff shares were quoted at $4.75 bid. </TEXT></DOC>
