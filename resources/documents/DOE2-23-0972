It has been designed for nuclear and atomic physics experimentsrequiring multiparametric data acquisition, analysis and display. Itallows fast event recognition performed by a special CAMAC module, dataacquisition based on automatically generated routines according to user-definedevents, on-line integration of raw, calculated and gated parameters.A high resolution colour display is used to show 1-D and 2-D spectra.</TEXT></DOC>
