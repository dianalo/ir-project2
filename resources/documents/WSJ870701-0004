Clark, pending a Supreme Court decision on a related case that isn't expected until next spring.    Mr. Clark, a lawyer, was indicted in January on 55 felony counts, most related to an insider-trading scheme involving nonpublic information misappropriated from The Wall Street Journal in 1983 and 1984. A former Journal reporter, R. Foster Winans, has been convicted and sentenced along with two others in the case, but the three have appealed to the Supreme Court and their sentences have been stayed pending the appeal.    The judge's decision means that two related civil lawsuits, one filed against Mr. Clark by a former client and another filed by Mr. Clark against Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. and others, are likely to proceed before the Clark criminal trial. Kidder Peabody had urged that the criminal case proceed first.    If the convictions of Mr. Winans and the two other men are set aside, U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan ruled yesterday, &quot;the insider-trading counts against Clark must fall. It would be unfair to the defendant to make him undergo the ordeal of a trial under such circumstances.&quot;    The Winans appeal -- which raises a major securities-law question about the validity and scope of the &quot;misappropriation theory&quot; used to prosecute insider trading -- will probably be heard by the Supreme Court in October or November, and a decision isn't expected before spring 1988.    Besides staying the Clark case, Judge Keenan, in an 11-page opinion, denied the bid of Clark attorney F. Lee Bailey to admit polygraph tests as evidence at the trial, and denied his motion to dismiss, on technical grounds, the perjury count of his indictment.    The insider-trading charges against Mr. Clark involve Mr. Winans's leaks of advance word of market-sensitive Journal stories to Peter N. Brant, a former Kidder broker who has pleaded guilty in the case and is awaiting sentencing. Mr. Brant, the government charges, passed some of the information to Mr. Clark, who allegedly made $453,000 in illegal trading profit. Mr. Clark is also charged with defrauding clients of his law firm of $3.7 million and using those &quot;embezzled funds&quot; to trade on the Winans information.    The government has used the misappropriation theory of securities fraud to win cases against defendants, including Mr. Winans, who were accused of improperly obtaining stock information even though the information didn't come directly from an official of a company. Attorneys for Mr. Winans and the other two men have argued on appeal, however, that though their clients' conduct may have violated Journal policy, it didn't violate securities laws.    Though Judge Keenan said it would be &quot;preferable&quot; to have the criminal case proceed before the two civil actions, the judge hearing the civil cases recently ruled that his cases would start Aug. 3 if the Clark criminal case was stayed.    Federal prosecutors had wanted a trial on the embezzlement charges against Mr. Clark to proceed even if the insider charges were delayed. But Judge Keenan turned aside that motion.    Mr. Bailey, the attorney for Mr. Clark, said through a spokesman that he thought the judge's stay of the criminal case was &quot;appropriate.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
