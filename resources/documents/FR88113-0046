Notice of Special Review and Preliminary Notice of Intent To CancelOn April 10, 1985, EPA issued a Notice of Special Review (also called PositionDocument 1 of ``PD-1'') on pesticide products containing cyanazine (50FR 14151), following a finding that cyanazine met or exceed the risk criteriain 40 CFR 162.11(a)(3)(ii)(B), which were in effect at that time. The new,revised risk criteria which appear at 40 CFR 154.7(a)(2) are met or exceededas well.The Cyanazine Special Review was based on teratology studies using oraladministration which showed that cyanazine produced teratogenic effectsin the Fischer 344 rat [lowest-observed-effect-level (LOEL)=25 mg/kg/day,no-observed-effect-level (NOEL)=10 mg/kg/day] and fetotoxic effects inNew Zealand white rabbit (LOEL=2 mg/kg/day, NOEL=1 mg/kg/day). Exposuresto mixers/loaders and applicators were identified as the occupational exposuresof concern.Dermal absorption and dermal developmental toxicity studies were submittedto the Agency after the issuance of the Notice of Special Review on cyanazine.These new data led to refinement of the risk estimates presented in theNotice of Special Review. The dermal developmental toxicity study demonstrateda NOEL of 573 mg/kg/day.Following review of public comments and available data, the Agency issueda Notice of Preliminary Determination on January 7, 1987, as well as theCyanazine Technical Support Document. That document discussed in detailthe Agency's determination regardng the risks arising from the use of cyanazineand the modifications to registration which, if adopted, would reduce risksto acceptable levels. Such modifications involved risk reduction measuresand included requirements for the use of protective gloves, closed loadingsystems, and chemical-resistant aprons, as well as label statements regardingthe cleaning of protective gloves, separate laundering of protective clothing,and the reason cyanazine has been classified for Restricted Use. This notice announces the Agency's intent to cancel registrations and denyapplications for registration for all pesticide products that contain cyanazineas an active ingredient, unless the terms and conditions of registrationare amended as described in Unit VI. This action is based on the Agency'sdetermination that the use of cyanazine will result in unreasonable adverseeffects to mixers, loaders, and applicators of cyanazine unless the requiredmeasures are adopted. A detailed discussion of the basis of this actionis contained in the Notice or Preliminary Determination and the CyanazineTechnical Support Document issued on January 7, 1987 (52 FR 589). ThisNotice constitutes the final Agency action on the Special Review of cyanazinepesticide products initiated by the results of the developmental toxicitystudies discussed herein. B. Legal Background In order to obtain a registration for a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, an applicant for registrationmust demonstrate that the pesticide satisfies the statutory standard forregistration, section 3(c)(5) of FIFRA. That standard requires, among otherthings, that the pesticide perform its intended function without causing``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment.'' The term ``unreasonableadverse effects on the environment'' is defined under FIFRA section 2(bb)as ``any unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into accountthe economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the use ofany pesticide.'' This standard requires a finding that the benefits ofthe use of the pesticide exceed the risks of use, when the pesticide isused in compliance with the terms and conditions of registration or inaccordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice. The burden of proving that a pesticide satisfies the standard for registrationrests on the proponents of registration and continues as long as the registrationremains in effect. Under section 6 of FIFRA, the Administrator may cancelthe registration of a pesticide or require modification of the terms andconditions of registration whenever it is determined that the pesticideappears to cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. In determining whether the use of a pesticide poses risks which are greaterthan the benefits of its use, EPA considers both possible changes to theterms and conditions of registration which can reduce risks, as well asthe impacts of such modifications on the benefits of use. If EPA determinesthat such changes reduce risks to the level where the benefits outweighthe risks, it may require such changes be made in the terms and conditionsof registration. Alternatively, EPA may determine that no change in the terms and conditionsof a registration will adequately ensure that use of the pesticide willnot pose unreasonable adverse effects. In that event, the Administratormay issue a Notice of Intent to Cancel the registration or may hold a hearingto determine whether it should be cancelled under FIFRA section 6(b). Indetermining whether to issue such a notice, the Administrator must takeinto account the impact of the action on production and prices of agriculturalcommodities, retail food prices, and other possible effects on the agriculturaleconomy. At least 60 days before formally issuing such a notice, he mustinform the Secretary of Agriculture in writing of the substance of theproposed actions and supply the Secretary with an analysis of the expectedimpact on the agricultural economy. At the same time, under FIFRA section25(d), the Administrator is required to submit the proposal to the ScientificAdvisory Panel for comment as to the impact on health and the environmentof the action proposed in the cancellation notice. EPA is also requiredby law, where appropriate, to consult with the U.S. Department of the Interior'sOffice of Endangered Species to see if the proposed action may affect anendangered species. Unless expedited procedures are employed, EPA informs the public of itsproposals to issue cancellation notices so that registrants and other interestedpersons can also comment or provide relevant information before a finalNotice of Intent to Cancel is Issued. Registrants and other interestedpersons are invited to review the data upon which the proposal is basedand to submit data and information to address whether EPA's initial determinationof risk was in error. In addition to evidence relating to risks, commentsmay include evidence as to whether any economic, social, and environmentalbenefits of use of the pesticide outweigh the risks of use. If, after reviewing the comments received, EPA decides to issue a Noticeof Intent to Cancel, and adversely affected person may request a hearingto challenge the action. In the hearing, any party opposing cancellationwould have an opportunity to present evidence. Other interested partiescould intervene to present evidence. At the end of the hearing, EPA woulddecide on the basis of the evidence presented whether or not to cancelor restrict the registration of pesticide products. If no hearing is requested,each registration would be cancelled by operation of law 30 days afterreceipt by the registrant or publication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of the final notice, whichever occurs later.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Determination of Risks</ITAG>A. Risk Assessment and Risk Reduction MeasuresThe Technical Support Document includes a detailed discussion of the developmentaltoxicity demonstrated by the cyanazine studies, which include anophthalmia,microphthalmia, skeletal variations, diaphragmatic hernia, dilated brainventricles, and cleft palate, as well as detailed discussions of the Agency'sexposure assessment and risk assessment. The Agency's risk assessment indicates that, while the degree of risk variesdepending on the use rate and the number of acres treated, the risk isunreasonable without the adoption of protective measures as specified herein.Traditionally, the Agency prefers the use of an oral NOEL to assess thedevelopmental toxicity hazard of dietary exposures and a dermal developmentaltoxicity NOEL for occupational exposures, because each NOEL provides informationrelative to the potential hazard posed by a pesticide from that chosenroute of administration. Based on the NOEL (573 mg/kg/day) from the dermaldevelopmental toxicity study in rabbits and exposure estimates from a cyanazineexposure study, margins-of-safety (MOSs) were developed using the followingformula:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,s8,23,1,36,r8</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Margin-of-Safety (MOS)</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>Dermal Developmental Toxicity NOEL</H1><H2>Exposure level</H2><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Agency generally considers a MOS of less than 100 for this biologicalendpoint to be a matter of concern. 1. <T3>Ground Boom Application. </T3>The MOSs presented for ground boom applicationassume that the mixer/loader and applicator are the same person. The MOSsare greater than 100 for all application rates to corn, cotton, wheat fallow,and milo when protective gloves are worn during mixing and loading operationsand when adjusting, repairing, or cleaning equipment, as shown in the followingTable 1:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,tp8,p8,8/9,i1,s25,4,5,5,5</C><T4>Table </T4>1_<T4>Margins-of-Safety for Ground Boom Application \1\</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Corn </H1><H1>Cotton</H1><H1>Wheat fallow</H1><H1>Milo</H1>Applicator \2\<ITAG tagnum="2">No protection \3\<D>7</D><D>21</D><D>11</D><D>21</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Gloves \3\<D>670</D><D>1,980</D><D>990</D><D>1,980</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Gloves/closed cab<D>4,240</D><D>12,730</D><D>6,370</D><D>12,730</D><F>\1\ The MOSs in this table are for the highest use rates.</F><F>\2\ Assumes that mixer/loader and applicator are the same person.</F><F>\3\ The approximately two order of magnitude difference in the MOSsbetween the no glove scenario and the glove scenario is a result of comparingtwo independent data bases and the effect of protective gloves on reducingexposure.

ThisTable is not intended to imply that protective gloves can reduce totaldermal exposure by two orders of magnitude.</F></ITAG></ITAG>    2. <T3>Aerial Application. </T3>Aerial application to corn, grain sorghum,and wheat fallow is minimal. There are no data showing that cyanazine isbeing applied aerially to cotton.         The MOSs for mixer/loaders during aerial use are less than 100 unless protectivegloves are worn during mixing and loading operations and when adjusting,repairing, or cleaning equipment and a closed loading system is used, asshown in the following Table 2:      <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,p8,8/9,i1,s25,7,6,6   </C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Margins-of-Safety for Aerial Application \1\   </T4><H1> </H1><H1>Grain sorghum</H1><H1>Corn</H1><H1>Wheat fallow</H1>      <ITAG tagnum="1">Applicator (Pilot)<D>320</D><D>170</D><D>250         </D></ITAG>Mixer/Loader:         <ITAG tagnum="3">No Protection (open pour)</ITAG><D>5</D><D>2</D><D>2         </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Gloves (open pour)</ITAG><D>24</D><D>11</D><D>12         </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Gloves/Closed System</ITAG><D>1000</D><D>440</D><D>520         </D><F>\1\ The MOSs in this table are for the highest use rates.</F></ITAG>         3. <T3>Chemigation. </T3>Corn is the only crop for which chemigation is listedon the label as an application method. The MOSs for chemigation are lessthan 100 unless protective gloves are worn during mixing and loading operationsand when adjusting, repairing, or cleaning equipment, and a closed loadingsystem is used, as shown in the following Table 3:      <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,p8,8/9,i1,s25,6   </C><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>Margins-of-Safety for Chemigation \1\   </T4><H1> </H1><H1>Corn</H1>         Applicator:         <ITAG tagnum="3">No protection (open pour)</ITAG><D>13         </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Gloves (open pour)</ITAG><D>59         </D><ITAG tagnum="3">Gloves/Closed System</ITAG><D>2490         </D><F>\1\ The MOSs in this table are for the highest use rate.</F></ITAG>            4. <T3>Spray Drift. </T3>Surrogate exposure studies were used to estimateexposure to cyanazine through spray drift. Based on these exposure estimates,the MOS for a population exposed to cyanazine by spray drift would be over1000.         B. Other Risk Reduction Measures         1. <T3>Separate Laundering. </T3>Secondary exposure may occur when contaminatedclothes are brought home. Although data are not available to quanitfy suchexposure, data do show that cross-contamination does occur when contaminatedclothes are washed with household laundry. Washing cynazine-contaminatedclothes separately from household laundry would prevent cross-contaminationof other laundry.         2. <T3>Chemical-Resistant Aprons. </T3>While the risk of dermal exposure tothe body from leaning against tanks during mixing or loading operations(a common occurrence) and accidental spills cannot be quantified, it maybe significant in light of the developmental toxicity of cyanazine. Wearinga chemical-resistant apron while mixing or loading cyanazine would reduceexposure from accidental contact or spills.         3. <T3>Washing of Protective Gloves. </T3>Because hands receive the largestpercentage of the dermal exposure during mixing/loading, the Agency believesthat protective gloves will be contaminated on the outside with cyanazine.If protective gloves are washed with soap and water after use and beforebeing removed from the hands, the risk of exposure from contaminated gloveswill be reduced.         4. <T3>Restricted Use.</T3> Cyanazine products have already been classifiedfor Restricted Use, as stated in the cyanazine Registration Standard whichwas issued in January 1985. The Registration Standard stated that the reasonfor this Restricted Use classification was that cyanazine had been detectedin ground water and surface water. Label language regarding cyanazine'sdevelopmental toxicity and detection in ground water and surface waterwas added to cyanazine labels in accordance with the Registration Standard,but this language was not explicitly tied to the Restricted Use requirement.   The Agency's preliminary determination proposed requiring labels to furtherstate that cyanazine products have specifically been classified for RestrictedUse because cyanazine has been found in ground water and because it hascaused birth defects in laboratory animals. The Agency based that proposedrequirement on the belief that the reasons a pesticide is classified forRestricted Use should be more prominently displayed on the labels so thatthe users and other members of the public can more readily identify thesereasons.    State sponsored monitoring studies, available at the time the RegistrationStandard was issued, had located residues of cyanazine in wells in Iowa,Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Illinois, and Vermont. Only a small percentageof all the cyanazine samples taken were positive, at levels close to 1part per billion (ppb). Also, the Agency Office of Water Regulations andStandards' STORET data base had reported finding cyanazine in wells. Thatdata base included reports on 1564 samples, reporting 21 positive samples(1.3 percent), with the 85th percentile level equal to 0.2 ppb. (Stateagencies submit data into the STORET data base.)    To provide a more systematic evaluation of cyanazine's contamination potential,the Agency required the registrant to conduct a ground water and surfacewater monitoring study. Those data have now been submitted and reviewedand are summarized below.    Two study areas of two counties each were monitored in 1986. In the hydrogeologicallyvulnerable East Coast, Sussex County, Delaware and Worcester County, Marylandwere sampled. In the moderately vulnerable Midwest study area, ChampaignCounty, Illinois and Jones County, Iowa were studied. There were no positiveresults in the 400 samples (200 wells each sampled twice). These resultshave some consistency with the previously mentioned monitoring studieswhich showed 1 percent positives with findings near and less than 1 ppb.   As a result of the newly generated monitoring data and the previously availabledata, the Agency no longer believes that cyanazine has significant groundwater contamination potential. Therefore, EPA no longer believes that goundwater contamination should be a reason for classifying cyanazine for RestrictedUse. Therefore, all cyanazine labels will include a statement that cyanazineproducts have been classified for Restricted Use only because cyanazinehas caused birth defects in laboratory animals. However, because some instancesof contamination were reported in the earlier studies, the Agency believesthe ground water advisory statement should remain on the label.    <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Determination of Benefits    </ITAG>A. The Effect of the Risk Reduction Measures on Benefits    The Agency expects that the risk reduction measures required in this Noticewill have a negligible effect on the benefits otherwise associated withthe use of pesticide products containing cyanazine. The requirements involvingseparate laundering, washing of gloves, and adding a statement on RestrictedUse to the cyanazine label will have minimal impact on the cost of usingcyanazine pesticide products. The requirements to use protective glovesand aprons will have a negligible impact on the cost of use of cyanazineproducts. In as much as there is not a great deal of aerial use of cyanazineand most aerial applicators already have systems which allow for some degreeof closed transfer, the requirement that aerial applicators use closedloading systems is not expected to have a significant impact on the benefitsassociated with cyanazine use. Similarly, there is little use of cyanazinethrough chemigation, and the requirement that closed loading systems beused with chemigation is not expected to have a significant impact on benefits.None of the modifications are expected to prevent users from using cyanazineproducts wherever such products are currently used. Thus, the Agency believesthat the required modifications will have a negligible impact on the benefitsassociated with the use of pesticide products containing cyanazine.                 B. Benefits and the Types of Applications    1. <T3>Ground Boom Application. </T3>The largest use of cyanazine is for broadleafand grass weed control in corn, accounting for about 95 percent of itstotal annual usage. Approximately 15 to 20 million acres (20 to 25 percentof the total U.S. corn acreage) of corn are treated annually with cyanazineas either the sole active ingredient or tank-mixed with other herbicides.Growers select cyanazine over other available herbicides for the followingreasons: (a) It has a wide annual broadleaf and grass weed control spectrum;(b) it can be tank-mixed with a number of herbicides to broaden its weedcotnrol spectrum; (c) it has relatively short persistence in the soil;(d) it has no rotational crop restrictions; and (e) certain soil typesand/or soil conditions require the use of a short residual herbicide inorder to rotate to different crops. The Agency assumes that the overallimpacts from cancellation of cyanazine use on corn could have significantimpacts to individual users in those areas where soil conditions precludethe use of more persistent chemicals. The Agency assumes that since thecosts of the required label modifications to the user are relatively low,no one who is currently using cyanazine would be kept from its use in thefuture. As a result, there would only be a negligible reduction in benefitsin relation to those benefits which are currently realized.    Only small acreages of wheat fallow, cotton, and sorghum are treated withcyanazine in the United States. Cyanazine is used primarily where a broadspectrum of weed control is desirable without the carry-over associatedwith many of the more residual herbicides. As with the impact on benefitsto cyanazine use on corn, the Agency also assumes that there would onlybe a negligible reduction in the benefits of cyanazine use of wheat fallow,cotton, and sorghum as a result of the required label modifications.   2. <T3>Aerial Application. </T3>Available data indicate that approximately70,000 acres of corn are treated aerially with cyanazine. Aerial applicationto grain sorghum and wheat fallow is minimal. There are no data showingthat cyanazine is being applied aerially to cotton. The main benefits fromaerial application are the ability to treat either a large area in a shortperiod of time or when the soil in the fields is too wet to allow accesswith ground equipment. The Agency assumes that the costs resulting fromthe label modification which requires closed systems for transfer of cyanazinewill not create significant hardship or reduction in these benefits becausemost aerial applicators already have systems which allow for some degreeof closed transfer.    3. <T3>Chemigation. </T3>No significant usage of cyanazine through chemigationhas been reported. The Agency assumes that the required label modificationswill therefore have no significant effect on the benefits associated withthat type of application.    <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Comments of USDA, SAP, and Public  </ITAG>A. Comments From USDA and Agency Response    In accordance with FIFRA section 6, the Agency's preliminary determinationwas sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for comment.    <T3>Comment From USDA. </T3>USDA commented that EPA did not give a numericalestimate for the benefits of cyanazine use on corn and that EPA shouldexamine the risks associated with cyanazine's alternatives.    <T3>Agency Response. </T3>In the Cyanazine Special Review Technical SupportDocument, which was issued with the Agency's preliminary determinationon cyanazine, the Agency assumed that the overall impacts from cancellationof cyanazine on corn would be low due to the availability of registeredalternatives. EPA did not conduct a quantitative estimate of the benefitsof cyanazine use on corn because EPA concluded that the impacts on cornfarmers will be negligible if the registrant maintains its registrationswith the label modifications proposed by the Agency in its preliminarydetermination.    Therefore, the Agency does not expect those who use cyanazine now to stopusing cyanazine and switch to an alternative herbicide because of the requiredmodifications to cyanazine labels. However, as mentioned in the Agency'sTechnical Support Document for cyanazine, the following herbicides maybe used as alternatives to cyanazine: Alachlor; atrazine; prometryn; propachlor;fluometuron; diuron; and simazine. The risks associated with these alternativesare given in Unit IV.A.1.-7. of this notice.           1. <T3>Alachlor. </T3>Sufficient toxicity data in laboratory animals are availablein the Agency to classify this pesticide under toxicity category III foracute oral and dermal exposure. This chemical does not cause eye or skinirritation.No teratogenic effects were demonstrated when alachlor was given to pregnantrats. However, administration of alachlor to rats at 30 mg/kg/day throughthree successive generations produced kidney alterations in F2 and F3 offspring.A reproductive NOEL was established by the Agency at 10 mg/kg/day.Evidence of a mutagenic effect was not demonstrated in the several assays(CHO/HGPRT, Salmonella, <T3>E. coli,</T3> and <T3>B. subtilis</T3>). Data from chronic feeding studies indicated thatalachlor induced nasal turbinate tumors in rats and bronchiolar alveolartumors in female mice. This herbicide is classified as a category B2 oncogen(probable human carcinogen) by the Agency and a consolidated Q* (cancerpotency) of 8 andmultiply; 10^2 for (mg/kg/day)^1 human equivalents has beencalculated. These risks are discussed in the Agency's Conclusion of SpecialReview for Alachlor signed on December 14, 1987.2. <T3>Atrazine. </T3>The available toxicity data support the classificationof atrazine under toxicity category III for acute oral, dermal, and inhalationexposure. Atrazine is neither a dermal nor eye irritant.A rat developmental toxicity study has been classified as SupplementaryData because a developmental toxicity NOEL could not be established. TheLOEL was 10 mg/kg/day (lowest dose tested), based on an increased incidenceof runts. A maternal NOEL was established at 10 mg/kg/day, with decreasedbody weight observed at 70 mg/kg/day.A rabbit developmental toxicity study showed a NOEL of 1 mg/kg/day anda LOEL of 5 mg/kg/day for maternal toxicity, based on reduced body weightgains. The NOEL for developmental toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day and the LOELwas 75 mg/kg/day, based on increased resorptions, reduced fetal weightsfor both sexes, and increases in delayed ossification. The rabbit studyis also classified as Supplementary Data.In a chronic/oncogenic rat study, an increase in carcinomas of the mammaryglands was observed in females fed 70, 500, or 1000 parts per million (ppm)for 2 years. There was also an increase in the incidence of fibroadenomas/carcinomas(1000 ppm) and all mammary tumors in females receiving 500 and 1000 ppm,when compared to controls. The Agency has classified atrazine as a categoryC carcinogen (possible human carcinogen). Mammary gland adenocarcinomaincidence data were used to estimate the Q* of atrazine. The Q* was determinedto be 1.24 andmultiply; 10^1 (mg/kg/day)^1 in human equivalents.3. <T3>Prometryn. </T3>The available toxicity data place technical prometrynunder toxicity category III for acute oral and dermal, and toxicity categoryIV for acute inhalation exposure. There is no evidence to suggest thatprometryn is a dermal or eye irritant.A developmental toxicity NOEL was established at 72 mg/kg in rabbits butno developmental toxicity NOEL could be ascertained from a rat teratologystudy. Although the rat multigeneration reproduction study was classifiedas supplementary data, there is no suggestive evidence of an adverse effecton reproduction up to and including the highest dose tested, 5 mg/kg/day.Chronic and oncogenicity data are insufficient to assess the oncogenicpotential of prometryn.4. <T3>Propachlor. </T3>Propachlor is moderately toxic to laboratory animals.The acute oral and dermal LD50s are classified as toxicity category IIIand IV, respectively. Placement of propachlor in rabbit eyes produced cornealopacity, ulceration, iris irritation, chemosis, and conjunctivitis. Thisherbicide is also a strong dermal sensitizing agent.Administration of propachlor to pregnant rats did not result in developmentaltoxicity up to and including a dosage level of 200 mg/kg.The reproductive and the oncogenic potential cannot be ascertained sinceno valid studies are available. It is noteworthy to mention that propachloris structurally related to alachlor (discussed previously), a B2 oncogen.5. <T3>Diuron. </T3>Diuron is classified as toxicity category III for acuteoral, dermal, and inhalation exposure. It does not produce eye or skinirritation.No acceptable teratology studies are available to assess the developmentaltoxicity potential of diuron. A multigeneration reproduction study wasconducted in rats and decreased F2b and F3a offspring weights were notedat the single dose level tested (6.25 mg/kg).No acceptable oncogenicity studies are available. However, diuron was clastogenicin an <T3>in vivo </T3>cytogenetic assay. Further, diuron is structurally relatedto linuron, a category C oncogen (possible human carcinogen).6. <T3>Fluometuron. </T3>Sufficient data are available to suggest that fluometuronhas a low acute toxicity in laboratory animals. The acute oral and dermalLD50s and the acute inhalation LC50 belong to toxicity category III. However,fluometuron produces severe dermal irritation, corneal opacity, and maycause dermal sensitization.No data are available to assess the developmental toxicity, reproductive,chronic, mutagenic, and oncogenic potential for this herbicide.7. <T3>Simazine. </T3>Simazine is structurally related to atrazine and cyanazine.It is relatively non-toxic to laboratory animals after acute oral exposure(toxicity category IV). However, it is moderately toxic after inhalation(toxicity category II). The 80 percent wettable powder formulation producedcorneal opacity and skin irritation.A developmental toxicity NOEL was established in rabbits at 75 mg/kg/daywith decreased fetal weights and increased skeletal variations noted atthe 200 mg/kg/day. In the rat, administration of 100 ppm did not exertany adverse reproductive effect.Data are inadequate to assess the chronic toxicity, oncogenic and mutagenicpotentials of simazine.In summary, the Agency has a more complete data base for cyanazine thanfor most of its alternatives. The most widely used alternative to cyanazineis atrazine, which may have more persistent residues, has been classifiedas a category C oncogen, and leaches through the ground at the same rateas cyanazine.B. Comments From SAP and Agency ResponseIn accordance with FIFRA section 24, the Agency's preliminary determinationwas sent to the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP or Panel) for comment.An open meeting was held with the SAP on March 24, 1987 to discuss scientificissues being considered by the Agency in connection with the Special Reviewof cyanazine. Specifically, the Agency requested any comments that thePanel wished to make with regard to the Agency's use of the dermal developmentaltoxicity study to assess the hazards from dermal exposure.1. <T3>SAP Comment on Maternal Toxicity. </T3>The Panel believed that thedermal developmental toxicity study was an appropriate data set for determininghazards from dermal exposure. However, the Panel also believed that thetoxic endpoint that should have been used was the NOEL for dermal maternalsystemic toxicity (96 mg/kg/day), not dermal developmental toxicity (573mg/kg/day). The Panel stated that developmental toxicity occurred onlyat doses that were maternally toxic, and maternal systemic toxicity occurredat lower exposures; thus, a lower MOS existed for adult animals than forthe developing fetus.<T3>Agency Response. </T3>Oral administration of technical cyanazine induceddevelopmental toxicity (including malformations) in rabbits and rats. Fromthe rabbit oral developmental toxicity data, both maternal and fetal developmentaltoxicity NOELs were established at 1 mg/kg/day.Dermal application of technical cyanazine produced maternal toxicity (bodyweight depression and food consumption reduction) at 283 mg/kg/day andabove. A maternal NOEL was established at less than 96 mg/kg/day basedupon dermal irritation and at 96 mg/kg/day based upon systemic effects.Developmental toxicity (delayed ossification) was found at 955 mg/kg/dayand a dermal developmental toxicity NOEl was established at 573 mg/kg/day.The NOEL of 573 mg/kg/day for dermal developmental toxicity was used bythe Agency to calculate risk in its preliminary determination.A Peer Review Committee consisting of representatives from different AgencyOffices met to discuss the comments raised by the SAP. The Peer ReviewCommittee concluded that the use of the maternal NOEL from a developmentaltoxicity study in calculating the MOS may not be justified because:a. In general, maternal toxicity end points determined from a developmentaltoxicity study (body weight, organ weight, food consumption, clinical signs)are insensitive parameters that do not reflect a true NOEL. Based uponthe weight-of-evidence, determination of maternal toxicity requires scientificjudgement on a case-by-case basis.b. Developmental toxicity manifestations may or may not be associated withmaternal toxicity because the mechanisms by which toxicity is manifestedare different.c. As a screening test, a developmental toxicity study is designed primarilyto assess effects on the developing organism and does not allow characterizationof subtle changes in systemic toxicity due to an inadequate length of exposure(10 days).d. Manifestations of maternal systemic toxicity may result from repeatedexposures whereas manifestations of developmental toxicity more likelyresult from a single exposure. Therefore, NOELs for maternal systemic toxicityand for developmental toxicity may not reflect comparable lengths of timeduring which exposure occurred.2. <T3>SAP Comment on Label Language. </T3>The SAP believes that the Agencyis correct in requiring the label changes to reduce applicator exposure,but that it should not state that birth defects are the reason since developmentaltoxicity occurred at maternally toxic doses and maternal systemic toxicityoccurred at lower exposures.<T3>Agency Response. </T3>The SAP recommendation relative to ``maternaltoxicity occurred at lower doses than developmental toxicity'' appliedonly to the dermal developmental toxicity data. By the oral route of administration,developmental toxicity and maternal toxicity are observed at the same doselevel (both NOELs are established at 1 mg/kg/day and both LOELs are establishedat 2 mg/kg/day). The Agency's ``Guideline for the Health Assessment ofSuspect Developmental Toxicants (1986)'' states that ``when developmentaleffects are produced only at maternally toxic doses, the types of developmentaleffects should be examined carefully, and not discounted as being secondaryto maternal toxicity. Current information is inadequate to assume thatdevelopmental effects at maternally toxic doses result only from the maternaltoxicity; rather, when the lowest observed effect level is the same forthe adult and developing organisms, it may simply indicate that both aresensitive to that dose level.''The developmental toxicity hazard of cyanazine was demonstrated by theoral route of administration (structural abnormalities including malformations)at maternally toxic doses, (indicating that both the mothers and developingorganisms may be equally sensitive to that dose level), and confirmed bythe dermal route of administration (developmental delay, altered growth)at doses higher than those producing maternal toxicity. Therefore, thedevelopmental toxicity hazard of cyanazine is still of concern and failureto state that ``* * * cyanazine has caused birth defects in laboratoryanimals * * *'' is not justified. Consequently, the Agency supports itsoriginal position of requiring this advisory statement on cyanazine labels.C. Comments From the Public and Agency ResponseThe only public comment submitted in response to the Agency's preliminarydetermination which challenged the Agency's position was submitted by thecyanazine registrant, E.I. Du Pont De Nemours Company (Du Pont). The CyanazineTechnical Support Document, which was issued with the Agency's preliminarydetermination, cited Shell Chemical Company, Setre Chemical Company, andR.F. Lindsey and Sons as the registrants for cyanazine. However, sincethe preparation of the Technical Support Document, Setre and Lindsey havevoluntarily cancelled their cyanazine registrations, and Du Pont has purchasedShell's cyanazine registrations.1. <T3>Du Pont Comment on Birth Defects Labels. </T3>Du Pont believed thatthere was no basis for concern from exposures associated with present uselabels and that the statement regarding birth defects should be removedfrom the label. Also, Dupont stated that maternal toxicity was always seenat doses lower than those showing fetotoxicity, and therefore, cyanazinewas not a true ``teratogen'' and should be of no concern.<T3>Agency Response. </T3>By the dermal route of administration, structuralanomalies (not malformations) are observed in rabbits at doses higher thanthose producing maternal toxicity. However, by the oral route of administration,manifestations of developmental toxicity, including malformations: Anophthalmia/microophthalmia;dilated brain ventricles; and diaphragmatic hernia, are observed in bothrabbits and rats. Although these manifestations occur at a dose level whichalso produces some evidence of maternal toxicity, they cannot be consideredas secondary to maternal toxicity.Current information is inadequate to assume that developmental effectsat maternally toxic doses result only from maternal toxicity; rather, whenthe lowest effect is the same for the adult and developing organisms, itsimply indicates that both are sensitive to that dose level. Therefore,the association between developmental toxicity manifestations in both ratsand rabbits by the oral route of administration and cyanazine cannot beruled out. Based upon these data, there is evidence to suggest that cyanazineis a developmental toxicant (multispecies evidence of similar findings).Du Pont's statement, ``maternal toxicity was always seen at doses lowerthan those showing fetotoxicity,'' is misleading. This is true for thedermal but not for the oral studies in which maternal toxicity and fetotoxicityoccurred at the same dosage level.2. <T3>Du Pont Comment on Separate Laundering. </T3>Du Pont agreed that cross-contaminationmay occur when contaminated clothing is washed with household laundry andthat separate laundering is a ``prudent precaution'' to take with all pesticidecontaminated clothing. However, Du Pont questioned ``the imposition ofa requirement to launder cyanazine-contaminated clothing separately fromhousehold laundry in lieu of data specific to cyanazine.'' Du Pont believedthat ``this requirement should be added to cyanazine labels at the timethis change is mandated for all pesticide labeling, unless specific datawarrant otherwise.''       <T3>Agency Response. </T3>The Agency notes that Du Pont agrees that itwould be prudent to wash cyanazine-contaminated clothing separately fromhousehold laundry. The Agency believes that by stating such on the labelit is more likely that this precaution will be taken. That label languageis being required to be added to cyanazine labels at this time in orderto reduce potential exposure and because the Agency has just completedits review of worker exposure to this chemical.3. <T3>Du Pont Comment on Chemical-Resistant Aprons. </T3>Du Pont disagreedwith the Agency's position regarding the use of chemical-resistant aprons.In opposition to a statement which was made in the Agency's preliminarydetermination, Du Pont stated that there were data to quantify the risksassociated with dermal exposures resulting from leaning against mixingtanks and accidental spills; Du Pont stated that the cyanazine exposurestudy which was used by the Agency to calculate some of the risks presentedin the preliminary determination employed all common practices in mixingand loading, including leaning against the spray tanks. Also, Du Pont believedthat chemical-resistant aprons were bulky and cumbersome to wear and proposedthe following label language, instead of requiring the use of chemical-resistantaprons:<ITAG tagnum="21">In case of accidental exposure, remove contaminated clothing and washskin thoroughly with soap and water. Replace contaminated garments withclean, freshly laundered clothing before returning to pesticide handlingoperations.</ITAG><T3>Agency Response. </T3>The Agency has no indication that chemical-resistantaprons are difficult to wear and has imposed this requirement on otherpesticide registrations. The Agency does not agree with Du Pont's proposedlabel language because it is unlikely that when an accidental spill occurs,a pesticide operator would be in a situation where it is convenient toimmediately remove his/her clothing, put on clean clothing, and resumehis/her duties.4. <T3>Du Pont Comment on Restricted Use Classification. </T3>Du Pont alsobelieved that cyanazine should be reclassified from Restricted Use to generaluse. Du Pont based their position on the beliefs that: Cyanazine is nota teratogen in the absence of maternal effects; the Agency's requirementsfor additional protective clothing and closed loading systems will provideadequate occupational MOSs; and recently collected ground water samplesdid not contain detectable residues of cyanazine or the amide metaboliteSD 20258.<T3>Agency Response. </T3>The Agency agrees with Du Pont's comment thatit is not appropriate to classify cyanazine for Restricted Use due to groundwater concerns. As discussed in Unit II.B.4. of this notice, new monitoringdata have shown that out of 400 samples from 200 wells in two East Coastcounties and two Midwest counties, no detectable levels of cyanazine werefound. However, the Agency continues to believe that cyanazine poses developmentallytoxic concerns and that Restricted Use is an appropriate requirement tomitigate this concern.The Agency has found that when a pesticide is classified for RestrictedUse, the pesticide operators are better educated in the proper use of apesticide. Therefore, it is more likely that label directions will be compliedwith, and practices are less likely to occur which may result in unreasonableexposures to mixers/loaders or applicators. Therefore, cyanazine will remainclassified for Restricted Use because of its developmental toxicity.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Risk/Benefit Conclusions</ITAG>As discussed in Unit II. of this notice, the Agency has found that thereare substantial risks associated with the currently registered use patternsof pesticide products containing cyanazine. The Agency has also determinedthat there are modifications available that can significantly reduce theserisks. The Agency has further determined in Unit III. of this notice thatadoption of these modifications will have a negligible effect on the benefitsassociated with the use of pesticide products containing cyanazine. TheAgency therefore believes that current use patterns generally cause unreasonableadverse effects upon the environment and that cyanazine products shouldbe cancelled unless the following modifications are made:1. For ground boom applications, the label must require: a. The use ofprotective gloves; b. use of chemical-resistant aprons; c. separate launderingof cyanazine-contaminated clothes; and d. washing of protective gloves.In addition, the label must include a statement explaining that cyanazineproducts have been classified for Restricted Use because cyanazine hascaused birth defects in laboratory animals.2. For aerial applications and chemigation, the label must require: a.The use of protective gloves; b. a closed loading system; c. use of chemical-resistantaprons; d. separate laundering of cyanazine-contaminated clothes; and e.washing of protective gloves. In addition, the label must include a statementexplaining that cyanazine products have been classified for RestrictedUse because cyanazine has caused birth defects in laboratory animals. Thelabels of product formulations which cannot be used in a closed loadingsystem must contain language prohibiting the use of those formulationsvia aerial application and chemigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Compliance With This Notice</ITAG>A. DefinitionsThe following terms are defined for the purposes of this Unit.1. ``Manufacturer'' refers to any registrant who, as defined, sells ordistributes a pesticide product containing cyanazine.2. ``Distribute and sell'' and grammatical variants refer to the distribution,sale, offering for sale, holding for sale, shipping, delivering for shipment,or receiving and (having so received) delivering or offering to delivera pesticide product.B. Requirements for Complying With This Notice    A manufacturer of any pesticide product containing cyanazine must submitan application to amend the registration of the product within 30 daysof publication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>or receipt of this notice, whichever is later,to be allowed to continue to sell and distribute the product.

Existing Stocks and Disposal Provisions    Under the authority of FIFRA section 6(a)(1), EPA will establish certainlimitations on the sale, distribution and use of existing stocks of cyanazinepesticide products subject to any final cancellation notice. EPA definesthe term ``existing stocks'' to mean any quantity of cyanazine pesticideproducts in the United States on the effective date of final cancellationof a cyanazine registration or on the effective date an application foramendment of registration as provided for in Section VI.B of this noticeis granted by the Agency. Such existing stocks include cyanazine productsthat have been formulated, packaged and labeled and are being held forshipment or release or have been shipped or released into commerce.   As stated earlier in this notice, EPA believes certain modifications tothe terms and conditions of registration are necessary in order to preventthe use of cyanazine products from causing an unreasonable adverse effectupon the environment. In order to allow for the modifications to be madeor to allow for substitution of alternative control methods, EPA will allowsale and distribution of existing stocks of cyanazine for up to six monthsafter final cancellation or approval of an amendment to the registration.Existing stocks may be sold or distributed, by the registrant or by anyother person, after this six-month period only if the stocks have beenrelabeled to reflect the modifications identified in this notice.    EPA also will allow use of existing stocks for up to 1 year after finalcancellation or approval of an amendment to the registration. Existingstocks may be used after this one-year period only in accordance with themodifications identified in this notice. Any disposal of existing stocksnot relabeled in accordance with this notice must be in accordance withthe requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.    Any existing stocks provisions involved in voluntary cancellation of acyanazine product prior to the publication of the final Notice is not affectedby this provision.    <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Procedural Matters    </ITAG>This notice announces EPA's intent to cancel the registrations of pesticideproducts that contain cyanazine.
