Michael A. Andrews, D-Texas, leadorganizer of the conference held in Texas. ``Each year, a millionyoung people start smoking.''   Among the co-sponsors of the conference Jan. 27-28 in Houstonwas the Coalition On Smoking Or Health _ comprised of the AmericanCancer Society, the American Heart Association and the AmericanLung Association _ and the American Medical Association.   Scott Ballin, chairman of the coalition and vice president forpublic affairs of the American Heart Association, said theconference report ``strengthens the advocacy campaign of thetobacco-control movement'' and also supports the legislative agendaannounced by the coalition at the start of the current Congress.   Among the recommendations of the January conference:   _The Food and Drug Administration should be given some authorityover all tobacco products. Under present law, the FDA does notregulate tobacco use because it does not meet the legal definitionof food or drug.   _Tobacco advertising must be restricted to eliminate itsinfluence on children.   _Excise taxes on tobacco products should be increased.   _The federal tobacco price support program should be eliminated.   _Non-smokers should have legal protection from having to inhalethe smoke of others in airplanes, all public places and in theworkplace.   _The federal government should stop encouraging the export ofU.S. tobacco to other countries.   Ballin noted that the coalition has been working ``with keymembers of Congress to put the conference's recommendations intoaction'' since they were issued made in January.   Among bills being pushed are two separate proposals to boost the16-cent-per-pack cigarette tax _ one by 22 cents and one by 25cents.   Also pending are at least 13 other bills that would _ in one wayor another _ restrict the use, sale and advertising of tobacco.</TEXT></DOC>
