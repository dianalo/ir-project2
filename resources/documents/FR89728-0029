This proposal area was originallypart of the RARE II Bighorn Weitas Roadless Area (andplusmin;1306). An environmentalimpact statement (EIS) will be prepared which will document the analysis.This EIS will tier to the Clearwater National Forest Land and ResourceManagement Plan of September, 1987, which provides overall guidance inachieving the desired future condition for the area. The primary purposeof the proposed action is to improve big game range and produce timber,improving growth and yield on suitable ground.  Some preliminary scoping was initiated for this project in March, 1988.The Forest Service is seeking information and comments from Federal, State,local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may now be interestedin or affected by the proposed actions. This input will be used in preparingthe Draft EIS (DEIS). This process will include:  1. Identification of potential issues.  2. Identification of issues to be analyzed in depth.  3. Elimination of insignificant issues or those wich have been coveredby a relevant previous environmental analysis.  4. Identification of additional reasonable alternatives.  5. Identification of potential environmental effects of the alternatives. 6. Determination of potential cooperating agencies.  The agency invites written comments and suggestions on the issues and managementopportunities for the area being analyzed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>date:</T2> Comments concerning the scope of the analysis should bereceived by September 30, 1989 to receive timely consideration in the preparationof the Draft EIS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>address:</T2> Send written comments to Thomas C.

Management activities under consideration would occur in tributariesof Orogrande Creek and Weitas Creek. Included in the area of analysis areall or portions of the following: sections 24, 25,26, 35, and 36 T38N,R7E and Sections 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31,32, 33 and 34 T38N, R8E, Boise Meridian.  The Land and Resource Management Plan for the Clearwater National Forestprovides the overall guidance for management activities in the potentiallyaffected area through its goals, objectives, standards, guidelines, andmanagement area direction.  The areas of proposed harvest and reforestation for the Fuzzy Bighorn projectare within Management Areas E1, C8S, C3, C4 and M2. Forest plan directionstates that Management Area E1 consists of lands wich are generally themost productive timber land On the Forest. The management goal is to provideoptimum, sustained production of wood products in a cost effective manneras well as provide adequate protection of soil and water quality, manageviable elk populations, manage a range of fish habitat potential and managea roaded natural setting for dispersed recreation.  Management Area C8S consists of lands of high value fishery streams, productivetimber land, and key big-game summer range. The management goal is to maintainhigh quality wildlife and fishery objectives while producing timber fromthe productive forest land.  Management Area C3 contains land within inventoried big-game winter rangeand unsuitable for timber management. The management goal is to providewinter forage and thermal cover for big game.  Management Area C4 contains land within inventoried big game winter rangeand suitable for timber management. The management goal is to provide sufficientforage and cover for existing and projected big game populations in conjunctionwith achieving timber production outputs.  Management Area M2 consists of lands that are riparian and timber producingalong perennial streams. The management goal is to manage for multipleuse integrated with adjacent areas E-1 and C4, giving special considerationto protect water and other riparian resources.  The analysis will consider a range of alternatives. One of these will bethe ``no-action'' altenrative in which all harvest and regeneration activitieswould not be implemented. Other alternatives will examine various levelsand locations of harvest and regeneration to provide emphasis on differingmixes of timber and non-timber resource values.  The analysis will disclose the environmental effects of alternative waysof implementing the Forest Plan. The Forest Service will analyze and documentthe direct, indirect and cumulative environmental effects of the alternatives.In addition, the EIS will disclose the analysis of site specific mitigationmeasures and their effectiveness.Public participation is especially important at several points of the analysis.People may visit with Forest Service official sat any time during the analysisand prior to the decision. However, two periods of time are identifiedfor the receipt of comments on the analysis. The two public comment periodsare during the scoping process (now thru September 30, 1989) and duringreview of the Draft EIS (December 1989).The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, will beinformally consulted throughout the analysis. To meet the requirementsof the Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service willreview the EIS and Biological Assessment and, if necessary, render a formalBiological Opinion of the effects on the Threatened and Endangered Speciesincluding the grizzly bear, and gray wolf.The DEIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) and available for public review by November 30, 1989. At that time,the EPA will publish a notice of availability of the DEIS in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. After a 45 day public comment period, the commentsreceived will be analyzed and considered by the Forest Service in the finalenvironmental impact statement (FEIS). The FEIS is scheduled to be completedMarch, 1990.The Forest Service believes it is important to give reviewers notice atthis early stage of several court rulings related to public participationin the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmentalimpact statements must structure their participation in the environmentalreview of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency tothe reviewer's position and contentions. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.v. NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections thatcould be raised at the draft environmental impact statement may be waivedor dismissed by the courts. Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris, 490 F.Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it isvery important that those interested in this proposed action participateby the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive commentsand objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time whenit can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final environmentalimpact statement.To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues andconcerns on the proposed action, comments on the draft environmental impactstatement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if commentsrefer to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments mayalso address the adequacy of the draft environmental impact statement orthe merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement.(Reviewers may wish to refer to the council on Environmental Quality Regulationsfor implementing the procedural provisions of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.)The Forest Service will respond in the FEIS to the comments received onthe DEIS. The District Ranger who is the responsible official for thisEIS will make a decision regarding this proposal considering the comments,responses, environmental consequences discussed in the FEIS and the applicablelaws, regulations and policies. The decision and reasons for the decisionwill be documented in a Record of Question.Thomas C. Blunn, District Ranger for the Pierce Ranger District, ClearwaterNational Forest, is the Responsible Official.<ITAG tagnum="6">Thomas C.
