As a Windows tool, thespeed and power of Actor's predefined classes make the product even moreexceptional.andM;That power comes at a price, however: An Actor development session feels likeprogramming, unlike ToolBook and KPWIN where the program seems like anautomatic by-product of applications design.andP;  Actor's tutorials are excellentbut are of the &quot;now type this&quot; variety rather than the on-line &quot;now click onthis&quot; of ToolBook.andM;Unlike ToolBook and KPWIN, Actor can create a DOS application that does notrequire an auxiliary run-time file.andP;  This process also strips out unnecessarycode, producing a compact and fast program.andP;  The process is not quite assimple as Whitewater's claim of &quot;automatic&quot; would suggest, but the manualprovides detailed directions.andM;Actor's documentation is completely redesigned for release 3.0, withgenerally good results.andP;  However, the explanation of the applications'&quot;sealing-off&quot; process was easier to follow in 2.0's manual.andM;Like the classic Xerox Corp.andP;  Smalltalk-80 development environment, Actormaintains a library of classes, which grows over time as the user/developerrefines and extends the original system.andP;  Actor's &quot;class browser,&quot; a vitaltool for navigating the resulting hierarchy, is effective and easy to use.andM;For some users, Actor will be the right mix of hands-on programming power anda Windows-based development environment.andP;  However, Actor may not meet allneeds.andM;For those already proficient in a standard language, such as C, itsproprietary language may seem a waste of time.andP;  (See story, Page 66.)andM;The Whitewater Group, in Evanston, Ill., can be reached at (708) 328-3800.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;&quot;We chose Actor because it was object-oriented and had a rich set of classlibraries devoted to Windows functionality,&quot; said Eric Herbel, director ofmedical systems at Hoescht-Roussel Pharmaceuticals Inc., a chemicalsmanufacturer in Somerville, N.J.andP;  Herbel uses Actor 2.0 and, at the time ofthis review, was evaluating the beta version of 3.0.andM;&quot;It is a very natural tie to developing in Windows with very high-levelconstructs dealing with windows and dialogue boxes,&quot; he added.andM;&quot;We looked at other packages, but Actor was the most complete,&quot; said RobertMoore, managing director of systems at Rogers, Casey andamp; Associates Inc., apension investment firm in Darien, Conn.andP;  Moore evaluated Caseworks' CASE:Wand Glockenspiel Limited's CommonView.andM;&quot;For the novice user it does a good job of hiding the complexity of Windowsfrom the user with prewritten object classes, which do most of what a userwould need,&quot; said Moore, who has also purchased Actor 2.0 and is presentlybeta testing Actor 3.0.andM;Although some training time was needed to develop in the object-orientedlanguage of Actor, both buyers agreed that the debugging facilities offerbenefits.andM;&quot;When you look at things in an object-oriented way, it streamlines thedevelopment process,&quot; said Moore.andP;  &quot;And once you develop and design code itdoes become reusable in other applications.&quot;andM;For many prospective users, the critical event for Windows 3.0 is not theadvent of new applications, but the migration of familiar text-mode products.andO;For developers, this creates a need for tools to help them build a newinterface around existing core code, mostly written in C.andM;The key Windows tool for C developers, Microsoft Corp.'s Windows SoftwareDevelopment Kit, was not released at the time of this review.andP;  (PC Weekexamined a prerelease version in the Windows Special Report in the May 22issue.)andM;PC Week did examine for this review three other aids to &quot;C'ing&quot; throughWindows: CASE:W 1.20 from Caseworks Inc. of Atlanta; WindowsMaker (examinedin prerelease &quot;Alpha3&quot; state) from Candlelight Software of Las Vegas; andDialogCoder 1.00 from The Software Organization Inc. of Brookline, Mass.andM;CASE:W, the most mature of the three, has been reviewed several times by PCWeek, most recently in the Dec.andP;  11, 1989, issue.andP;  Like WindowsMaker, it letsthe developer build the presentation layer using interactive graphicaluser-interface techniques.andP;  In both products, a code generator then producesthe corresponding code, preserving the developer's modifications if and whencode is regenerated later in the development process.andM;WindowsMaker, due to be shipped this month, claims more efficient codegeneration, offering examples that are verifiable but not conclusive.andO;WindowsMaker, however, supports only the C programming language; Caseworksalso serves the broader Systems Application Architecture (SAA) environmentwith CASE:PM, a compatible OS/2 environment for all the SAA languages (C,COBOL and FORTRAN), C++ and mainframe Customer Information Control System.andM;DialogCoder is a more focused tool that addresses only the creation ofdialogue boxes.andP;  This is not to be sneered at, because dialogues can be themost confusing piece of a complex graphical user- interface application, anddevelopers need all the help they can get.andM;DialogCoder 1.00 provides an imaging port to support Wang Laboratories Inc.'sOpen Image Windows imaging tool kit, accelerating the development ofapplications, such as Wang's Freestyle, that transfer images as easily astoday's software transfers text.andM;Case:W and WindowsMaker each costs $795, DialogCoder is $499.andP;  -- P.C.C.andM;Because of their name, it's easy to forget that many of the benefits ofgraphical user interfaces have nothing to do with graphics.andM;A character-based interface can support windows, icons, menus and a pointingdevice without the overhead of pixel-by-pixel graphics.andP;  Even MicrosoftCorp.'s Works integrated software and Quick language products use a friendlybut economical character-oriented Windows design.andM;A software developer has put these features into an off-the-shelf developmenttool.andP;  Magma Software Systems, of Millburn, N.J., has created a programminglibrary called Magma Extensible Window and Event Library (MEWEL).andP;  MEWELsupports message-based programming compatible with the Windows/PresentationManager application programming interface.andP;  This permits development of fast,text-based applications that conform to the Common User Access component ofIBM's Systems Application Architecture.andM;Magma's customer list includes American Airlines Inc., ATandamp;T and StanfordUniversity.andP;  Units also have been sold to graphical user-interface proponentsIBM, Microsoft and The Whitewater Group.andP;  MEWEL costs $195 in library format,or $495 with full source code.andP;  A demo disk is priced at $15, or the demo canbe downloaded free from Magma's bulletin board at (201) 912-0668.andP;  Magma canbe reached at (201) 912-0192.andP;  -- P.C.C.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
