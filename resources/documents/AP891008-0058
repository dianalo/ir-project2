(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   State and federal investigators seized amine company's log books, memorandums and computer printouts intheir probe of a coal mine explosion that killed 10 miners lastmonth.   Agents of the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, FBI,Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Marshals Service and Kentucky StatePolice acted Friday and Saturday on search warrants issued by ajudge for Pyro Mining Co.   Harvey Fenster, a spokesman for Pyro Mining, said the companyalready had turned over most _ but not all _ records sought byinvestigators. He said the company would have turned over theremainer if investigators had gone through proper channels.   Michael Finnie, a special investigator for the Mine Safety andHealth Administration, said in a sworn statement submitted to acourt Friday that workers removed a cinder-block barrier inside thewestern Kentucky mine about 15 minutes before the Sept. 13explosion.   That action disrupted air currents, creating dangerous levels ofexplosive methane, Finnie said.   Pyro Mining said Saturday in a statement that the company didnot violate federal mine-safety laws by making a ventilation changein the mine the day of the explosion. The company did not elaborate.   Last month Ron Siler, president of Costain Coal Inc., parent toPyro Mining, said a barrier was indeed taken down the morning ofthe explosion, but after the fatal blast, not 15 minutes before.And he contended that its removal could not have been a factor,even if it came before the accident.   The company also denied Finnie's allegation that employeesapparently tore pages out of mine record books before giving thebooks to federal officials the day of the explosion.   Investigators have said the explosion occurred after a spark _possibly from a welder's torch or electrical equipment _ ignited adangerously high concentration of methane.</TEXT></DOC>
