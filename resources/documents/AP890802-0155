Col. William Higgins, including criticism fromIran's president-elect, left U.S. officials somewhat encouragedWednesday about the fate of the second American hostage facing adeath sentence in Lebanon.   Two days after a militant Shiite group in Lebanon announcedHiggins' execution on Monday, State Department spokeswoman MargaretTutwiler said she was unable to think of a single country thathasn't spoken out against the action.   Still, other officials cautioned the situation remains grim,pointing out the captors of Joseph Cicippio, who was taken hostagein 1986, have not backed off their pledge to execute him onThursday.   Ms. Tutwiler seemed to attach importance to a joint statementissued Tuesday in Tehran by Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze and Iran's president-elect Ali Akbar HashemiRafsanjani in which they expressed regret over Higgin's reporteddeath.   They also condemned ``all acts of a terrorist nature.''   Ms. Tutwiler called on Rafsanjani to act ``in accordance withthe spirit'' of his statement.   She said the United States ``remains convinced that Iran is in aposition to bring significant influence to bear'' on thepro-Iranian groups who hold the American hostages and she called onthe Iranians to use the influence.   If Higgins' death is confirmed, that would leave eight Americanhostages in Lebanon. The State Department was still unable toconfirm absolutely that the body in the videotape released Mondayin Beirut was that of Higgins.   Ms. Tutwiler also welcomed a statement by a top aide toPalestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat criticizingthe execution of Higgins.   The sense among American officials was that the outrageexpressed by Western as well as Islamic countries about thedevelopments in Beirut may be having an impact on Iran and itsShiite allies in Lebanon.   The officials, asking not to be identified, left open thepossibility that the Iranians may have convinced the captors ofCicippio, 58, to delay his execution by 48 hours.   A crisis atmosphere had prevailed here when the group claimingto hold Cicippio, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, said itwould kill him Tuesday at 11 a.m. EDT unless Israel freed a ShiiteMoslem cleric kidnapped by Israeli commandos July 28.   With the delay in administering the death sentence, officialsexpressed hope that intensified diplomatic efforts by U.S. envoysmay be bearing fruit. The U.S. diplomats have been in touch with anumber of countries with access to or influence with Iran.   In Beirut, Shiite Moslem sources said Iranian pressure may havebeen behind the decision to delay the execution and added thechance his life may be spared has increased.</TEXT></DOC>
