Congress still refuses to repeal theabusive Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law,so Louisiana federal Judge Frank Polozola did the next bestthing. He punished the lawyers who filed a classic RICOlawsuit by ordering them to take $323,532.92 out of theirpockets and give it to the defendants.   This is what Our Lady of the Lake Hospital in New Orleans,its board of directors and several staff doctors had to payto defend themselves from charges that they were &quot;racketeers&quot;for removing a surgeon for incompetence. After several yearsof internal review and a critical report by an independentgroup of thoracic surgeons, the hospital fired Dr. PrentissSmith. His lawyers filed a $22 million RICO lawsuit on hisbehalf against numerous defendants. A nun and a priest whoworked at the hospital were excluded from the suit; theplaintiff's lawyers explained that while they were as guiltyof racketeering as the named defendants, they wouldn't havethe money to pay any award.</LP><TEXT>   The case looks like a bald attempt to chill thepeer-review system the hospital used to weed out doctors forremoval. The allegations were never very clear. For example,to meet the requirement of two predicate acts as part of apattern of racketeering, the lawsuit alleged wire fraud. Thewire fraud, however, turned out to be two telephone messageslips indicating that the Society of Thoracic Surgeons hadreceived a copy of Dr. Smith's records that it analyzed inits critical report.   RICO is so vaguely worded that most cases just go merrilyalong, racking up the legal bills until the defendant criesuncle and offers a settlement. Here, Dr. Smith's side forced2,200 pages' worth of depositions and gathered 3,000 pages ofmaterial during discovery. Then the judge made clear that hethought the claim had no merit, and eventually Dr. Smith andhis lawyers dropped the RICO case.   It's worth noting that if we had the English rule onattorneys' fees -- which applies in almost all countriesoutside the U.S. -- the losing side would automatically paythe winner's legal bills. Full justice requires no less.Here, the defendants had to ask the judge for compensationfor their legal bills under Rule 11 of the federal rules ofcivil procedure, which punishes harassing or frivolouslawsuits.   Judge Polozola said that Dr. Smith and his lawyers at theprominent New Orleans law firm of Stone, Pigman, Walthen,Wittmann andamp; Hutchinson, took even the open-ended RICO law toofar. He said that before finally dropping the lawsuit, they&quot;openly and flagrantly abused the judicial system by causingunnecessary delay and harassment, making scandalous,unjustified and unsupported allegations in their pleadings,abusing the discovery procedures of the federal court andproceeding in an improper and frivolous manner with callousdisregard of the judicial system.&quot;   The judge made another important point. He ruled thatthere is &quot;a greater responsibility to inquire into the factsand law on counsel who file RICO suits&quot; than other kinds ofcases. This is because of RICO's unique &quot;potential forfrivolous suits in search of treble damages.&quot; Earlier, Rule11 sanctions were imposed against RICO cases filed bylawyer-radicals Ramsey Clark and Christic Institute officers.The new caveat-emptor rule for racketeer-happy lawyers: Youfile your RICO suit, you take your chances.   The blame here is less on the lawyers for using a vaguelaw to help a client than on Congress, which is too beholdento the PACs of contingency-fee plaintiff lawyers to repealRICO. The Supreme Court also shares the blame for failing toinvalidate what the Justices have admitted is a dangerouslyhazy statute. Three cheers for Judge Polozola for hitting thelawyers where it hurts, but only Congress or the SupremeCourt can put RICO out of the country's misery for good.</TEXT></DOC>
