Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, a seniormember of the Intelligence panel overseeing the CIA, remainsundecided on the nomination. The Georgia Democrat was amongthose who argued for a public airing of charges that Mr.Gates tailored intelligence at the agency to suit hissuperiors in the Reagan administration.</LP><TEXT>   After appearing behind closed doors Wednesday, past andcurrent analysts at the CIA will be called back next week totestify regarding Mr. Gates's record in the agency. And thereis pressure in both parties for a broad declassification ofdocuments to permit a more educated understanding of thedebate. An expert in Soviet studies, Mr. Gates is being mostdirectly challenged by colleagues with the same background,and one byproduct of the debate may be an unusual look backat the analyses that influenced the U.S. military buildup inthe 1980s.   &quot;I'm not leaning either way, but the charges are seriousallegations that have to be aired,&quot; said Mr. Nunn. &quot;Thisrelates to the future of the agency, the morale of theagency. It goes beyond a single individual.&quot;   Melvin Goodman, a professor at the National War Collegeand former colleague of Mr. Gates's at the CIA, was his mostsevere critic in testimony this week. But Republicansacknowledged that the nominee had been hurt as well by theimpromptu remarks of Hal Ford, an almost dean-like figure inintelligence analysis with a long record at the CIA.   &quot;It's not a net plus,&quot; said a senior Republican. And thedispute goes to the same issue of intellectual integrity thathas dogged Mr. Gates in explaining his role in theIran-Contra affair. In many respects, the judgments are lessclear in the argument over intelligence analysis than themore factual record of that scandal. But for some senators,who have been reluctant to revisit Iran-Contra, the focus nowon the politicizing of intelligence is more central to thecommittee's role as a protector of the intelligence process.   Mr. Gates had strong defenders as well in the closed doortestimony this week, and is still favored to be confirmed.But in demonstrating his independence as an analyst, he mostoften cites his willingness to challenge the State Departmentunder former Secretary George Shultz. In fact, politically,Mr. Shultz was a favorite target for conservatives in theReagan administration. And in a controversial case in 1985,Mr. Gates lobbied behind the scenes to suppress dissent fromintelligence analysts at the State Department, who opposed apaper used by his boss, the late CIA Director William Casey,to advance the sale of arms to Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
