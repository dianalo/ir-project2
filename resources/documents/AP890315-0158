(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cartoonist Berke Breathed has poked fun atCrayola crayons once again, but the crayon maker says things aren'tas black and white as they appear in ``Bloom County.''   In January, Breathed drew a strip in which a black child wantingto draw a self-portrait contemplated a crayon whose color waslabeled ``flesh.''   But Binney andamp; Smith, Inc., makers of the crayons, sent a letter toBreathed noting that it had changed the label from ``flesh'' to``peach'' in 1963, partially as a result of the civil rightsmovement.   In strips appearing in Tuesday's newspapers, Breathedacknowledged the error, but targeted another color still used:indian red.   In the latest episode, the cartoon's fictional chief executiveofficer, W.A. Thornhump, says the company ``was accidentallymentioned here as selling racially insensitive pink crayons labeled`flesh.'' He continues it was ``a grave and foolish mistake. Crayolahasn't had `flesh' since 1963.''   Then, another character, the penguin Opus, notes, ``It does have`indian red,' tho.''   Crayola does have an ``indian red,'' Binney andamp; Smith spokesmanBrad Drexler said Tuesday, but it does not refer to anyone's skincolor.   ``It was used to describe the ground early American Indians usedin various projects,'' he said, citing pottery.   Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines indian redas ``a yellowish red ferruginous earth containing hematite and usedas a pigment.'' It's spelled with a lowercase ``i'' by bothWebster's and Binney andamp; Smith.   Drexler shrugged off Breathed's latest barb, saying, ``I guesshe's trying to get the last word in on the Crayola story.''   Ironically, it was Binney andamp; Smith that provided Breathed with hislatest ammunition.   Al Leeds, sales manager of the Washington Post Writers Group,which syndicates ``Bloom County,'' said Breathed found the ``indianred'' crayon in a shipment of crayons the Forks Township companysent to prove it no longer used ``flesh'' on its crayons.</TEXT></DOC>
