Confidence in the GCM predictionswill be much enhanced once the models are thoroughly tested in termsof their ability to simulate climates that differ significantly fromtoday's climate. Simulating the climate of the past 18,000 years providesone opportunity to test the models. As one index of climate change, themagnitude of the global mean temperature change during the past 18,000years was similar to that predicted for carbon dioxide doubling. Thecomparison of model results with paleoclimatic data can illustrate thesensitivity of the model's response to variations in the seasonal radiationbudget as well as to changes in other boundary conditions. These comparisonsalso provide the opportunity to check the sensitivity of the climaticresponse of critical components of the climate system such as sea-ice.During the past several years, we have used paleoclimatic data to testthe NCAR CCM, a model used in CO{sub 2} research, after changing itsboundary conditions to those appropriate for simulating past climates.We have assembled global paleoclimatic data sets of pollen, lake level,and marine plankton data, and calibrated many of the data in climaticterms. We have also developed methods that permit direct quantitativecomparisons between the data and model results. Our comparisons haveshown both some of the strengths and weaknesses of the model. 59 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
