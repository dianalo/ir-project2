Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said Tuesday thatmost U.S. intelligence agences now believe the Soviet Union ishiding hundreds of potent medium-range missiles in Europe. TheReagan administration said his assertion is incorrect.   Helms, commenting as the Senate Foreign Relations Committeecontinued its examination of the new treaty banning allmedium-range missiles in Europe, has repeatedly said estimates fromthe Defense Intelligence Agency indicate the existence of at least300 more SS-20 missiles than those declared by the Soviets.   The senator, who opposes the treaty, said on Tuesday he now hasbeen told a majority of U.S. intelligence agencies support thatview.   But Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-RI., the committee chairman, read anadministration statement denying that.   The statement called the Helms assertion incorrect, and added:``The majority of the national intelligence community does notsupport the view the Soviets have withheld a number of SS-20s.''   The statement said that all data on the number of such weaponswill be reviewed when the Soviets submit an updated report on theirmedium-range missile force after the new treaty is ratified by theSenate.   That report will be verified by on-site inspection, thestatement said.   It said that CIA Director William Webster, ``speaking for theentire intelligence community, has said the (submitted) Soviet data... `falls within (U.S.) intelligence estimates.'''   The SS-20 is a mobile, highly accurate, medium-range missile,each of which carries three nuclear warheads.</TEXT></DOC>
