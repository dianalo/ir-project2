Moslems and Arabs in Moscow, Bangladesh, Amsterdam, and Malaysiaalso protested the U.S. military deployment in the Persian Gulfregion, and most expressed support for Saddam's takover of Kuwait.   In Moscow, about 100 Arabs waving Iraqi flags and color postersof Saddam marched past the U.S. Embassy at midday and shoutedanti-American slogans for about 30 minutes. They dispersed after aU.S. Embassy official agreed to speak briefly to a representative.   ``Down with America and also Bush,'' said Sami Kamil, a doctorfrom Libya. ``It's our land, Arab land. We must control it. NoAmericans, no one from outside .. We don't want anybody there.''   The protest was organized by Arab students, said Ahmed Jassam, aphysics student at Moscow University. He said the crowd includedcitizens of 10 countries.   A larger protest occurred Friday in Dhaka, the capital ofBangladesh, where hundreds of 400 Moslems demanded the withdrawalof U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia. Unlike protesters in the othercountries, they also demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi troops fromKuwait, which has been occupied since Aug. 2.   More than 200 members of the fundamentalist Khelafat Andolan, orCaliphs' Revolution, marched from the Baitul Mukarram Mosque to thenearby National Press Club. ``Iraq get out of Kuwait!'' theychanted. ``Down with American imperialism! Americans get out of theholy land of Saudi Arabia!''   Nearly 200 youths converged on the press club at the same time.Their speakers said the world should pressure Saddam and PresidentBush to resolve the gulf crisis through negotiations.   The biggest show of support for the Iraqi leader was inJerusalem, where thousands of Palestinian Moslems cried ``Amen!''as Mohammed al-Kafrawi, chief preacher of the Al Aqsa mosque,praised Saddam and referred to Americans and Europeans as ``newcrusaders'' making war on the Arab nation.   ``God, make the desert a mass grave for the Americans,''al-Kafrawi said.   Al Aqsa and the adjacent Dome of the Rock are regarded as thethird holiest sites in Islam after Mecca and Medina in SaudiArabia. Their importance is evinced by the Saudi-donated carpetswith the country's symbol of crossed swords and a palm tree.   Friday noon prayers at Al Aqsa are the most important of theweek for Moslems, and the enthusiastic response to al-Kafrawi'ssermon signaled the Palestinians' anger at Saudi Arabia forinviting the Americans into the country to defend against Iraqiagression.   Referring to Saddam, the mosque preacher said ``Leader of Iraq... for the dignity of Islam, persist in your struggle to get ridof the American intervention and the forces of treason.''   Islamic fundamentalists and Palestinian activists alsodistributed anti-Saudi and anti-American leaflets to the crowd.   Several dozen ethnic Arabs demonstrated outside the U.S.Consulate in Amsterdam on Friday to protest U.S. military presencein the Persian Gulf. No incidents were reported.   Shouting ``Down with America!'' and ``Bush out of the gulf!''the protesters carried banners that read ``America out of theMiddle East'' and ``No War in the Gulf.''   There are about 400,000 Moslems in the Netherlands. Most haveorigins in Morocco, Turkey and Indonesia.   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, protesters burned an American flagand carried anti-American banners in front of the U.S. Embassy in ademonstration against the military deployment in Saudi Arabia.   About 1,500 members and supporters of the oppositionPan-Malaysian Islamic Party participated in the peaceful 90-minuteprotest. They carried banners and placards which among other thingsread ``Go to hell America.''</TEXT></DOC>
