More than a dozen protesters were beaten badly and at least 10were dragged away by police during a melee that broke out afterauthorities shouted through loudspeakers that the rally wasunauthorized.   It was the most violent clash between protesters and police sincethe gatherings began Sunday.   The crowd had been chanting slogans demanding broader freedoms inthe communist-ruled nation, but those slogans changed to ``Gestapo!Gestapo!'' when the baton-wielding wave of riot police sweptthrough, lashing out indiscriminately.   Officers linked arms to form human chains and push the protestersout of the square.   Mayor Vdenek Horcik appealed for the ``provocations'' to stop. Inan address on national television, which appeared after the mainevening news, Horcik urged parents and teachers to keep young peopleoff the streets and said the police action was necessary to maintainorder.   The crowd assembled shortly after 5 p.m., when many Pragueresidents were on their way home after work. They shouted ``FreeHavel!'' and ``Let them go!'' referring to human rights activistVaclav Havel and 14 others jailed for taking part in earlierprotests.   Hundreds of officers poured into the half-mile-long square fromsidestreets when the protesters refused to leave, charging the crowdand pushing them along the boulevard.   Police vans and ambulances with sirens blaring arrived to helpforce away the demonstrators. Water cannons were brought onto thesquare but not used.   The demonstrations began Sunday when about 5,000 people gatheredat Wenceslas Square for a memorial to Jan Palach, who burned himselfto death 20 years ago to protest the presence of Soviet troops afterthe 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion.   Troops and tanks sent in by the Kremlin in August 1968 crushedthe Prague Spring reforms, which now are likened to the social andeconomic changes championed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Some protesters yelled ``Gorbachev sees this!'' when police movedin Thursday.   On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, police used water cannons, dogs,truncheons and tear gas to break up rallies. About 5,000demonstrators gathered again Wednesday night, but police did notinterfere.   The more tolerant treatment was seen as the result of criticismby Western officials attending a human rights conference in Vienna.Czechoslovakia was one of 35 nations that agreed Sunday at themeeting to a broad package of rights and freedoms, and itsleadership drew fire for breaking up Sunday's peaceful demonstrationwithin an hour of the accord's adoption.   Members of the Charter 77 human rights group sent a letterThursday to Czechoslovakia's prime minister, Ladislav Adamec,demanding that jailed dissidents be freed and officials be moretolerant of public expression.   Vaclav Maly of Charter 77 said fellow activist Martin Palous wasdetained by police at his home around noon. Palous addressedWednesday's rally, reading a Charter 77 protest of the earlierarrests.   Maly also said a prosecutor informed activists that Havel,Czechoslovakia's best-known dissident, faces hooliganism charges. Hesaid the crime carries a maximum two-year jail sentence.   At least five other activists have been told they also will facecriminal charges for their roles in the demonstrations, Charter 77members said.   Communist authorities accused dissidents and the Western media offomenting the unrest.   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo said that on Wednesdaynight, ``a cluster of about 1,000 people in the upper half ofWenceslas Square made the usual everyday traffic impossible.''   ``The purpose of this unauthorized gathering was also this timeevident from chanted slogans attacking the socialist system and itsleading representative,'' Rude Pravo said.   In another development, former Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek, amember Charter 77, was denied permission to visit West Germany forthe 75th birthday of his friend, former Chancellor Willy Brandt.   Hajek, who was allowed to visit Austria last month, said Pragueauthorities deemed it against state interests for him to travelabroad.</TEXT></DOC>
