The biggest immediate threat to American business is the American legal system. What happened to Texaco could have happened to anyone.    Texaco's move to Chapter 11 is best understood as a do-it-yourself injunction against the Texas courts and Pennzoil. Now Pennzoil can't attach liens. Texaco tried to get a series of courts to block the $12 billion bond so that it could try to get the absurd trial verdict overturned without first having to post a crippling bond. It lost. So Texaco chose legal bankruptcy over actual bankruptcy. The betting is that this will shield it from unsecured creditors long enough for justice to prevail.    This is a painful process. But it is also probably the only hope Texaco had for finding a serious court to consider the core public-policy issue raised by this case: The U.S. legal system is supposed to create rules of behavior that are rational and certain, not bizarre and entirely unpredictable. Pennzoil v. Texaco is a national embarrassment. Foreigners may justifiably wonder how they can avoid local but utterly destructive legal pitfalls in this country when not even a powerhouse like Texaco can escape.    The courts so far have been hung up on the side issue of the size of the bond Texaco must post to appeal the ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court last Monday told Texaco it had to go back to the Texas courts for relief from the bond. The company had warned that it couldn't wait that long, and within the week Texaco's biggest creditors were already nervous. Banks and oil suppliers feared Pennzoil would get its liens before Texaco found a court willing to reduce the bond. Texaco gave additional security to its most important creditors, but this process couldn't last. In bankruptcy court, the secured creditors are better off than Pennzoil, which is unsecured.    Now that Texaco has the protection of a federal bankruptcy court, Texas itself is even more on trial than before. The only way Texas can begin to repair its reputation is for its supreme court to reverse the trial judgment.    The most fundamental question of contract law is at stake: When does an informal agreement become a legally binding contract? Pennzoil had an agreement to buy part of Getty, but this was explicitly &quot;subject to a definitive merger agreement.&quot; That distinction was entirely lost on trial Judge Solomon Casseb Jr., who in his jury instructions referred only to an &quot;agreement.&quot; A Texas appeals court concluded it was in Judge Casseb's &quot;discretion&quot; whether he followed the applicable New York law or not. The Texas Supreme Court hasn't decided if it will hear the case.    Outside Texas, only one court has given any thought to this key issue. Federal District Judge Charles Brieant last January lowered the bond from $12 billion to $1 billion. The Supreme Court overturned Judge Brieant on the bond issue, but he has interpreted New York contracts before, so his view is important in determining how the case should eventually come out. He noted that in New York law, which applies in the case, there is a huge difference between an agreement and a binding contract. The intentions of the parties aside, the agreement between Pennzoil and Getty couldn't be binding because it would have violated Securities and Exchange Rule 10b-13 against private dealings during a tender offer. This rule voids any such agreements.    Even if there is some liability, Judge Brieant said it couldn't be anything like $10 billion, which he called &quot;so absurd, so impractical and so expensive that it hardly bears discussion.&quot; Any appeals from the bankruptcy court will go to Judge Brieant's district.    The U.S. Supreme Court last week did acknowledge that this case raises &quot;federal constitutional questions&quot; of due process. Texaco lawyer David Boies says this particular claim will be based on dubious political campaign contributions by Pennzoil lawyers to Texas judges -- running unopposed -- who were involved in the trial. This gives the elected justices of the Texas Supreme Court something to think about. Their judicial pride could prove to be a virtue; no court likes to get overturned, especially when the whole world is watching.    In any event, Texas justice means that the well-publicized hard times in the oil patch may now get harder. For starters, bankruptcy procedures won't let Texaco finance independent contractors so easily. The salaries of the 15,000 Texaco employees in Texas (nearly half the company's total) and pensions of 8,000 retired workers are now subject to bankruptcy proceedings. (One irony is that the state civil-servant pension fund -- which covers Judge Casseb and his colleagues -- has big investments in Texaco.)    It is a sad and surreal day when one of the nation's 10 largest firms can declare bankruptcy and then say it hasn't felt so good in a long time. If unstopped, the disintegration of the rule of law will have huge costs. Not even a Texan's sense of size can do justice to the damage this travesty has already done to the good reputation of Texas, and now to the world's largest commercial nation. </TEXT></DOC>
