Network feed-in is possible from 5 MWalso. In Austria an installed output of 530 to 710 MW (capital investment3.8 to 5.0 milliard Austrian Schillings) could generate ca. 15 PJ ofdistrict heat (ca. 7.5% of the total low temperature usable energy) anddepending upon the method of power utilisation up to 19 PJ of primaryenergy could be saved annually. Both the energy-economical and environmentalbenefits of MCP plants must be used more efficiently by changing thepromotion policy and the structuring of electricity prices.</TEXT></DOC>
