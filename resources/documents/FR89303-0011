L. 98-473, Title II, section 1012, 98 Stat.1976, 2142 (1984) amended 18 U.S.C. 1114, which prohibits the killing ofdesignated federal employees, to authorize the Attorney General to addby regulation other federal personnel who will be protected by this section.The categories of federal officers and employees covered by section 1114are, by incorporation, also protected, while engaged in or on account ofthe performance of their official duties, from a conspiracy to kill, 18U.S.C. 1117; kidnapping, 18 U.S.C. 1201(a)(5); forcible assault, interference,or intimidation, 18 U.S.C. 111; and threat of assault, kidnap or murderwith intent to impede or intimidate, 18 U.S.C. 115. Consistent with thelegislative history and purpose of section 1114, this protective coveragehas been extended by 28 CFR Part 64 to those federal officers and employeeswhose jobs involve inspection, investigative or other law enforcement responsibilitiesor whose work involves a substantial degree of physical danger from thepublic that may not be adequately addressed by available state or locallaw enforcement resources.Field employees of the Social Security Administration have been assaultedand threatened by visitors to field offices, and a number of Nuclear RegulatoryCommission personnel involved in license hearings and adjudications havereceived threats. Therefore, their coverage under these regulations isappropriate. The former are added as new subsection (v) of 28 CFR 64.2,and the latter by amendment of subsection (m). United States InformationAgency Security Officer Special Agents perform a wide variety of investigativeand law enforcement functions and have on occasion been threatened. Theirinclusion within these regulations is appropriate, and they have been addedas new subsection (w).Because the material contained herein involves only three federal agenciesand is thus of limited and not general effect, the Department of Justicefinds inapplicable the provision of the Administrative Procedure Act (5U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for publicparticipation, and delay in effective date.The Department of Justice has determined that this Order is not a majorrule for purposes of either Executive Order 12291, or the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 64</ITAG>Crime, Government employees, and Law enforcement officers.By virtue of the authority vested in me by 28 U.S.C. 509, 5 U.S.C. 301,and 18 U.S.C. 1114, Part 64 of Chapter I of Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations,is hereby amended as follows:1.
