Lawyers for the class-action plaintiffs have told JusticeHelen E. Freedman of New York's State Supreme Court that theydeserve the fees for getting the brokers to agree to includea notice about interest rates in the monthly statement sentto margin-account customers.</LP><TEXT>   But about a dozen members of the plaintiffs' class havewritten to Justice Freedman, who is considering whether toapprove the pact, objecting to the settlement and urging hernot to agree to the attorney's fees. &quot;The settlement's solepurpose is to dramatically illustrate the unbelievable greedwhich permeates every level of the legal profession in thiscountry,&quot; wrote Douglas DeBernard of Hayward, Calif., in onesuch letter.   Some of those objecting to the attorneys' fees are lawyersthemselves. &quot;This is the kind of thing that gives attorneys abad rap,&quot; said Stephen M. Blitz, a Los Angeles lawyerexplaining why he wrote a letter objecting to the payment oflegal fees.   The lawsuit, filed in 1990, named seven brokerage houses,Bear Stearns and Co.; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andamp; SmithInc.; Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.; Prudential SecuritiesInc.; PaineWebber Inc.; Gruntal and Co.; and Donaldson, Lufkinandamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. About one million people who heldmargin accounts with their brokers from 1984 to 1990 wereincluded by the plaintiffs' lawyers in their class action.   The suit involved margin accounts, under which customerscan borrow cash against securities in their portfolios. Theinterest rate on such loans currently averages about 9%. Theplaintiffs' lawyers alleged that the practice of compoundinginterest charges on margin accounts -- charging interest onthe credit and interest on outstanding interest -- violatedNew York State law.   The brokers countered that the interest-rate charges onmargin accounts, which are applied in a similar manner asthose of credit cards, are part of a longstanding policy wellunderstood by their customers. In addition, they said it wascompletely lawful.   Thousands of hours of legal work later, the lawyers forboth sides agreed to settle the suit without any resolutionof the legal issues involved. (In fact, the New YorkLegislature recently clarified state law to make it clearthat compounding interest on margin accounts is legal.) Thedefendants agreed to notify customers about the compoundinterest rates, which at least two firms say they already do,and to pay legal fees to the plaintiffs' attorneys.   Fred Yager, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch parent MerrillLynch andamp; Co., said the company decided to pay the legal feesto avoid &quot;further litigation expenses.&quot; He also said MerrillLynch has a longstanding practice to include a notice aboutinterest rate charges.   &quot;These cases illustrate the important and significantcontribution that consumer class litigation can achieve inchallenging an unlawful industrywide practice,&quot; theplaintiffs' lawyers -- Mordecai Rosenfeld, who practices inNew York, and Jeanne P. Wrobleski, a member of thePhiladelphia firm Kohn, Klein, Nast andamp; Graf -- wrote in courtpapers urging Justice Freedman to approve the settlement.Neither Mr. Rosenfeld nor Ms. Wrobleski returned phone callsseeking comment.   &quot;The evidence is mixed&quot; on whether class-action lawsuitsin the securities area get results, said Harvey J.Goldschmid, a professor at Columbia University Law School.Prof. Goldschmid said it's difficult to evaluate how much achange in corporate practices, as opposed to a cash paymentto plaintiffs, is worth. But he added that if a lawsuitresults in nothing of value the judge shouldn't grant fees.   ---   VIRGIN AIR battles Virgin Atlantic Airways over use ofname.   Virgin Air Inc., an airline operating in the Caribbean,has asked a federal judge in Chicago to stop Virgin AtlanticAirways, a London-based operation, from using the name&quot;Virgin.&quot; Virgin Air, based in St. Thomas, the VirginIslands, claims that Virgin Atlantic has infringed on itstrademark since 1985 and is engaging in unfair competition.   The dispute is before Judge Elaine E. Bucklo in federalcourt because negotiations between the companies broke downand because the Department of Transportation discontinued itsdecades-old practice of settling airline name disputes. HalParis, a spokesman for the DOT, said that in 1988 the agency&quot;got out of the business because it was so time-consuming.&quot;   Paul Wikander, president and owner of Virgin Air, saidthat soon after Virgin Atlantic got off the ground in 1985,he told the new airline's officials that he believed theywere violating federal trademark law by using the name thathe had used since 1970. Mr. Wikander also has asked the courtto award him all profits earned by Virgin Atlantic.   Mr. Wikander said he has held back on opening a route toMiami where Virgin Atlantic operates because he fears thattravelers will be confused. &quot;We get their calls on our 800number; we get their complaints, billings, reservations andnasty letters about some of their advertisements,&quot; Mr.Wikander said.   Robert Alpert, a lawyer for Virgin Atlantic, said theairline filed a motion Tuesday asking the judge to dismissthe case or move it to federal court in New York.   ---   JUSTICE DEPARTMENT will get to look at reporter's phonerecords.   A federal district judge in Alexandria, Va., allowed asubpoena of Bell Atlantic Corp. records for a freelancejournalist's phone calls. The reporter, Gregory J. Millman,had cited nonpublic Internal Revenue Service documents in anarticle for the trade publication Corporate Finance.   Government employees who disclose tax return informationare committing a federal offense, an IRS spokeswoman said,adding that the subpoena is part of a continuing criminalinvestigation.   Bell Atlantic is scheduled to turn over the phone recordsthis morning. Margaret Elliott, editor of Corporate Finance,a unit of Financial World Partners, said the publication,which had tried to block the subpoena, considered filing anappeal but didn't have time. &quot;And there were no new argumentsto put forward,&quot; she added.   It's unusual, but not unheard of, for the government tosubpoena a journalist's phone records, said Jane Kirtley,executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom ofthe Press.   ---   POP STAR'S STEPFATHER sues for share of her earnings.   Making claims more common to celebrity divorce cases,Joseph Vian alleges that his stepdaughter, 21-year-oldrecording star Mariah Carey, has a contractual obligation toshare her earnings with him because he helped her achievesuccess.   In the suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Mr. Viansaid he encouraged and supported Miss Carey in her pursuit ofa singing career by doing such things as providingtransportation to rehearsals and paying for dental work. Mr.Vian also said in the suit that he and Miss Carey oftendiscussed his contributions to her career and that she&quot;promised that {Mr. Vian} would share in her financialsuccess, if any.&quot;   Peter Parcher, an attorney for Miss Carey at the law firmParcher andamp; Hayes in New York, said in a statement, &quot;It is asad day when a talented young woman is subjected to a lawsuitlike this from her mother's estranged husband. In ouropinion, the case is totally without merit.&quot;   Mr. Vian, of Lake Hiawatha, N.J., married Miss Carey'smother, Patricia Carey, in April 1988. The singer's mothersued Mr. Vian for divorce and the couple is currentlyseparated. In the suit, Mr. Vian also blamed the singer forbreaking up the marriage.   Family-law attorneys said the suit seeks to extend the lawaffecting celebrities and their ex-spouses into anunprecedented area. Raoul Lionel Felder, a divorce attorneyin New York, said it is highly unlikely that a court willfind that a stepparent's relationship with a childconstitutes a contract. &quot;I think it gives stepfathers a badname,&quot; he added.   But Gary Skoloff, an attorney with Skoloff andamp; Wolfe inLivingston, N.J., said such a claim could depend on how muchtime the stepparent devoted to the child's career. &quot;If hemade her career his career, he deserves something,&quot; Mr.Skoloff said.   ---   NOTED: Securities litigator James L. Truitt is leaving theDallas firm of Jackson andamp; Walker to join the Dallas office ofHutcheson andamp; Grundy, a Houston-based firm that is trying tobroaden its practice areas after a decline in business fromthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., a longtime client.
