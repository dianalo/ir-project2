HAMM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Organization for Women is usingpersonal checks to lobby against the Supreme Court decision givingstates greater leeway to regulate abortion.   People who advocate the right to choose can purchase brightyellow checks that say ``Pro Choice _ Protect Our Right to Choose''and send a political message each time they use their checkbooks,NOW spokeswoman Patricia Ireland said Thursday.   The average person writes 300 checks a year and the recipientsare ``a captive audience,'' said Priscilla Fenton, founder of theSeattle-based Messsage!Check Corp.   ``About six to 10 people see each check as it goes through thebanking system _ from the people you write the check to all the wayto the Federal Reserve,'' said company spokeswoman Jane Lockwood.   Asked what sparked the idea pro-choice checks, Ireland replied:``Money.''   ``Everybody has to spend it and this is a way that sends amessage with the money,'' she said. ``It's much more of aconsciousness-raiser than a fund-raiser. And it demonstrates theeconomic clout of pro-choice supporters.   ``A lot of people have been supporters but not activists sincethe Supreme Court decision went down,'' said Ireland, adding thatthe checks, which have been available about three months, give thema chance in everyday life to show their support for the pro-choicecause.   ``If I'm standing in a supermarket line and I write my check tothe cashier _ in some way it gives you the opportunity to talk topeople about the issue,'' she said.   NOW has been distributing checks that say ``Equality for Women''through Message!Checks for about four years, Ireland said.   Fenton, a former fund-raiser, formed Message!Checks about fouryears ago to help non-profit organizations get their messagesacross without spending much money.   In addition to NOW, the company prints checks with messages forthe Vietnam Veterans of America, Greenpeace, Mothers Against DrunkDriving, and several other groups.</TEXT></DOC>
