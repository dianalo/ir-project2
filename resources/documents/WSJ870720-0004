Reynolds Tobacco Co. to subpoena a scientist's &quot;life's work&quot; that shows a greater risk of lung cancer for cigarette smokers exposed to asbestos.    State Supreme Court Justice Ethel B. Danzig refused to allow R.J. Reynolds to look at 97 file-cabinet drawers, 250 bound volumes and assorted computer tapes of medical data compiled by Irving J. Selikoff that link asbestos and smoking.    The American Cancer Society and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, where Dr. Selikoff is based, say they were outraged at the tobacco company's request. R.J. Reynolds, in turn, says it's &quot;disappointed&quot; with the judge's ruling.    Dr. Selikoff -- one of the world's leading epidemiologists who was the first scientist to link asbestos exposure to lung cancer -- has published several influential articles concluding that someone exposed to asbestos is far more likely to get cancer if he smoked cigarettes than if he didn't smoke.    When R.J. Reynolds attempted to subpoena all of the doctor's data, collected over 22 years, the school and the cancer society howled. The lawyer for the school and society, Michael A. Cardozo, told the judge the subpoena was &quot;an assault on the integrity of academic research&quot; that would have a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on the scientific community.    In quashing the subpoena, Justice Danzig agreed that the tobacco company's motion, if allowed, would &quot;disrupt ongoing research&quot; at Mount Sinai and the cancer society.    The tobacco company, a unit of Winston-Salem, N.C.-based RJR Nabisco Inc., said it needed the data to bolster its defense in a lawsuit pending against it in California. That suit, similar to many the tobacco industry faces, involves a widow's claim that her late husband's smoking and exposure to asbestos combined to kill him.    Mount Sinai, the cancer society and their medical personnel aren't parties to the California suit.    Justice Danzig noted the tobacco company could have conducted its own medical research, as Dr. Selikoff had over the past 22 years. She also pointed out the 18,170 individuals studied by the doctor had received promises of confidentiality and it would take thousands of hours to purge their names from the data.    The judge agreed also the subpoena could have had a &quot;chilling effect and discourage future scientific endeavors.&quot;    &quot;We're obviously disappointed, because we feel it's unfair to have to confront data when we don't have the opportunity to cross-examine the author of the study or have access to the underlying data,&quot; an RJR Nabisco spokesman said.    The spokesman said the company will still pursue the data through a New York federal court, which had stayed consideration of a subpoena pending the outcome in the state court. </TEXT></DOC>
