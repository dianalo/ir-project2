This report was prepared by the Task Force on FelonIdentification in Firearm Sales.The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-690, section 6213, 102 Stat.4360) directs the Attorney General to develop a system for immediate andaccurate identification of felons who attempt to purchase one or more firearmsbut are ineligible to purchase firearms by reason of section 922(g)(1)of title 18, United States Code. The system is to be accessible to dealers,but only for the purpose of determining whether a potential purchaser isa convicted felon. The Attorney General is directed to establish a plan(including a cost analysis of the proposed system) for implementation ofthe system. In developing the system, the Attorney General is requiredto consult with the Secretary of the Treasury, other Federal, State andlocal law enforcement officials with expertise in the area, and other experts.The Attorney General further is directed to begin implementation of thesystem 30 days after a report to the Congress, which is due no later thanNov. 18, 1989.This report to Congress shall describe the system above referred to, togetherwith a plan (including a cost analysis of the proposed system) for implementationof the system. The report may include, if appropriate, recommendationsfor modifications of the system and legislation necessary in order to fullyimplement the system.Further, the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of theTreasury, is directed to conduct a study to determine if an effective methodis available for immediate and accurate identification of other personswho attempt to purchase one or more firearms, but are ineligible to doso by reason of section 922(g) of title 18, United States Code. In conductingthe study the Attorney General is required to consult with the Secretaryof the Treasury, other Federal, State and local law enforcement officialswith expertise in the area, and other experts. Such study is to be completedby May 18, 1990. This report is to be submitted to the Congress and madeavailable to the public. Such study may include, if appropriate, recommendationsfor legislation.

Pursuant to this mandate, the Attorney General requested thatthe Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs (OJP)establish a Task Force on Felon Identification in Firearm Sales to developa range of options that would comport with the statute.After preliminary research by components of the Departments of Justiceand Treasury, the Task Force held its first meeting on 14 March. I cannotoverstate my appreciation for the superlative efforts of all of the TaskForce representatives, especially the staff of OJP's Bureau of JusticeStatistics (BJS), which coordinated production of this Report. Under thedirection of Dr. Joseph M. Bessette, BJS staff invested considerable talentand expertise, and many evenings and weekends, to produce this document.The goal of the Task Force was to identify the entire range of issues thatought to be considered before implementing a felon identification system.Although this Report reflects an extensive and thoughtful review, it isimportant that the views of other Federal, State, and local officials,along with non-government experts, be taken into account before adoptingany particular system. While the Task Force has addressed many difficultand complex issues raised during the course of our study, we would be mostgrateful for any comments on this Report or suggestions for new avenuesto consider.President Bush is determined to close loopholes that ``allow deadly weaponsto fall into deadly hands.'' Although an effective felon identificationsystem will contribute toward achieving this goal, the President has proposeda more comprehensive approach, including enhanced penalties for crimescommitted with firearms. The President has further recognized that onebarrier to an immediate and accurate felon identification system, as notedin this Report, is incompleteness in criminal history reporting. The Presidenthas called upon the Federal, State, and local governments to provide timelyand accurate reporting of arrest and disposition records. Such a reformwould have benefits for a wide range of criminal justice applications.In Section 6213 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, known as the ``McCollum Amendment,''Congress has similarly recognized the need to develop improved mechanismsto enforce current laws that prohibit felons from obtaining firearms. Recentdevelopments in computerized criminal history information systems and improvementsin Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS) make possible theimmediate identification of felons. The goal of immediately identifyingfelons in the gun shop will be increasingly feasible as the advance oftechnology continues at its remarkable pace. It is not the existence ofthe technology, but rather its costs, the need for trained personnel, andthe incompleteness of criminal history records that present the greatestimpediments to implementing such systems.The Task Force does not in this Report make recommendations or reach conclusions.We are keenly aware of the significant concerns about protecting the privacyinterests of all citizens, as well as enhancing the ability of law enforcementauthorities to protect society from the criminal element. In addition,we recognize that those who select among the options must be mindful ofpreserving what Attorney General Thornburgh has called the ``historic andhonorable firearms tradition in this country.''The options contained in this Report fall into two basic categories: thosewhere identification of felons is made at the point of sale versus thoseinvolving a pre-approval procedure. Reliability would be greater with priorapproval if fingerprint checks are conducted requiring 4-6 weeks. The basicprior approval system, however, is considerably more expensive than thebasic point-of-sale system_perhaps two to three times as costly_and raisesother significant policy issues as well. It is clear to the Task Force,however, that considerably shorter waiting periods (7 days has been commonlysuggested) do not significantly enhance reliability over point-of-salesystems.The Report discusses options that range from lower-cost systems that minimizethe burden placed on firearm purchasers to extremely costly systems thatrely upon technology just now becoming available and that raise issuesof the type involved in a national identification system. The most elaborateoptions presented in this report may cost up to $10 billion or more. Butless exotic schemes, albeit less than perfect alternatives, are also presentedfor consideration. They could be implemented in the near term at substantiallyless cost. In assessing this Report, it is important to note that there could be shortcomingsin any felon identification system. In a 1984 study for the Departmentof Justice, it was determined that about five-sixths of convicted offendersin State prisons who admitted to ownership of firearms claimed to haveacquired their weapons from sources other than a retail outlet. Throughthe use of ``straw men'' who lack a criminal record, and therefore maybe eligible to purchase firearms, some felons are able to obtain the toolsof their deadly trade. In addition, there is an active ``black market''in firearms. Consequently, one major effect of a felon identification systemmay be to discourage felons from direct purchase and to encourage theiruse of alternative means to obtain prohibited weapons.  Although many of the options may be subject to intense public policy debate,the Task Force has attempted to remain assiduously neutral in preparinga complete and fair description of various alternatives. Each option presentedis meant to be flexible and adaptable to numerous modifications. If thisobjective has been achieved, then the Report can serve as a skeleton ontowhich decisionmakers may add the details necessary to produce a viablefelon identification system. Such a system must preserve legitimate rightsto privacy and firearms ownership, while at the same time enhancing theability of law enforcement to carry out its responsibility to maintainthe domestic peace.<ITAG tagnum="6">Richard B.

Introduction and Summary of FindingsThe Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Section 6213(a) of Public Law 100-690,November 18, 1988) requires the Attorney General, in consultation withthe Secretary of the Treasury and other Federal, State, and local law enforcementofficials, to ``develop a system for immediate and accurate identificationof felons who attempt to purchase one or more firearms but are ineligibleto purchase firearms by reason of section 922(g)(1) of Title 18, UnitedStates Code.'' The Attorney General is further required to make a reportto Congress describing such a system no later than 1 year after passageof the Act (November 18, 1989) and to begin implementation of the system30 days later (December 18, 1989). Finally, the Attorney General is requiredto conduct a study to determine whether an effective method can be designedto identify other persons prohibited by Federal law from purchasing firearms(Section 6213(c)). Such persons include fugitives from justice, those whouse or are addicted to illegal drugs, those who have been adjudicated asmentally defective or have been committed to any mental institution, illegalaliens, those dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, and thosewho have renounced their American citizenship. This second study must besubmitted to Congress by May 18, 1990.This report represents the completion of the first phase of the task todesign a system for identifying felons who attempt to purchase firearms.Its purpose is to describe a variety of possible options for such a system.It details the essential elements of each option; cost estimates; the impactof the system on firearm dealers and on local, State, and Federal law enforcementagencies; the strengths and weaknesses of each option; and associated legaland policy issues. The options are organized into two basic types: thosethat involve some kind of immediate verification at the gun shop of theprospective purchaser's eligibility, and those that require some kind ofprior approval process and documentation of the purchaser's eligibility.Within each of these categories the options are arrayed from the lower-costalternatives to higher-technology, more expensive options.This report does not address the issue of identifying other persons, besidesfelons, who are ineligible under Federal law from purchasing firearms.The Task Force decided that this parallel activity ought to be initiatedby a private contractor with expertise in criminal justice and informationsystems. The Bureau of Justice Statistics on behalf of the Task Force hasissued a Request For Proposals for such a study. Applications are currentlyunder review.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Scope of the Problem</ITAG>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) of the Department ofthe Treasury estimates that approximately 7.5 million new and used firearmsare sold at the retail level each year in the United States through 270,000Federally licensed firearm dealers.Currently, those who purchase firearms are required to fill out BATF form4473 at the dealership attesting that they do not fit into any of the categoriesof persons ineligible to purchase firearms. These forms include identifyinginformation for the purchaser as well as the type and serial number ofany firearms purchased. The forms are kept by the dealer and are subjectto inspection later by BATF officials. They may be examined, for example,to try to track down the purchaser of a firearm left at the scene of acrime.At this time there is no Federal requirement for any checking of the eligibilityof the purchaser, either before or after the purchase. The dealer reliessolely on the purchaser's signature attesting to his eligibility. Falsestatements by the purchaser on the BATF form are a Federal felony punishableby a prison term of up to 5 years.Although the Federal government does not require a criminal history orany other kind of check of firearm purchasers, the States are free to imposetheir own requirements. Currently 20 States and the District of Columbia(covering 55% of the Nation's population) stipulate that a pre-purchasecriminal history check be made of anyone who wishes to buy a handgun. Fourof these States and D.C. include the purchase of long guns in this requirement.These checks are done during a waiting period that ranges from 2 days to6 months. Two States without waiting periods do a criminal history checkonly after the purchase is made. Twenty-eight States currently requireno criminal history check for firearm purchases.Any system for identifying felons who attempt to purchase firearms mustconfront two distinct issues of scope. One is the large number of firearmsales in this country. The estimated annual total of 7.5 million retailsales is equivalent to a daily average of more than 20,000 sales, assuminga 7-day business week. Since many stores are likely to be closed on Sundaysand to be busier on Saturdays than mid-week, it is likely that on peakdays as many as 30,000 or more firearms are sold. During hunting seasonpeak-day sales may reach 50,000 firearms. Any new system for identifyingfelons must be capable of handling this heavy volume. Second, such a systemmust involve either the participation or cooperation (depending on thesystem) of 270,000 licensed firearms dealers. Although precise figuresdo not exist, it is estimated by the BATF that 60-70% of these dealersare not gun stores as such, but rather individuals who collect and dealin guns on a small scale (hobbyists, collectors, etc.). These small-scaledealers account for an estimated 20-25% of all firearm sales. Any systemthat placed special demands on gun dealers in terms of capital expenditures,training, or personnel resources would pose a particular problem for thesesmall-scale operations. Other problems may arise in attempting to identifyfelons who purchase firearms during gun shows or in other ways outsideof normal retail outlets.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Key Elements of a Felon Identification System</ITAG>There are three key elements of the felon identification system mandatedin Section 6213 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988: (1) the definitionof felon, (2) the meaning of ``immediate,'' and (3) the level of accuracyrequired.<T3>Definition of felon. </T3>Section 6213(a) relies on the definitionof felon previously specified in the Gun Control Act of 1968 (with subsequentamendments). This definition includes those convicted of a ``crime punishableby imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,'' but excludes (1) certainspecified Federal or State offenses relating to the regulation of businesspractices and (2) any offense classified by the State as a misdemeanorand punishable by a term of imprisonment not exceeding 2 years. Also excludedare those whose conviction has been expunged or set aside and those whohave been pardoned or who had their civil rights restored.This definition presents certain problems for any system that would accessautomated criminal history records as part of a clearance process:First, automated conviction records do not show how long a person couldhave been sentenced. Approximately one-third of those convicted of feloniesin State courts receive no incarceration sentence. Another fifth receivea sentence to a local jail, usually for less than 1 year. In these casesthe automated conviction and sentencing records often will not show whetherthe conviction could have resulted in a sentence of more than 1 year andtherefore whether the offense met the Federal definition of a felony.Second, the offense identifiers contained in automated conviction recordsmay not precisely show whether the offense is one of the business relatedcrimes exempted from the Gun Control Act. Third, automated criminal history records may not accurately show whethera conviction offense is a misdemeanor punishable by no more than 2 yearsof incarceration, also exempted from the Gun Control Act.Finally, automated criminal history records often do not show whether aconviction has been set aside or led to an eventual pardon or the restorationof civil rights. <T3>Immediate. </T3>The Anti-Drug Abuse Act does not define ``immediate''with relation to the mandated felon identification system. In the absenceof such a definition the Task Force has considered options that would meetthe immediacy test in two distinct ways. One is a system that would involveon-site inquiries by gun dealers (by telephone, for example) to determineeligibility at the time of purchase with response times of one to severalminutes. The other is a system involving a pre-approval mechanism wherebya prospective gun purchaser would apply for documentation (such as a license,permit, or identification card) authorizing him to purchase firearms andthen use that documentation each time he makes a purchase. In such a systemthe application process would take approximately 4-6 weeks. Once the documentationwas issued, however, the purchaser could buy a firearm without additionaldelay at the time of sale.<T3>Accurate. </T3>Although the Anti-Drug Abuse Act mandates the ``accurateidentification of felons,'' it does not specify the level of accuracy thatwould be acceptable. Accurately determining who is a convicted felon involvestwo issues. First is the identification of the person attempting to purchasea firearm. Although standard identification documents such as driver'slicenses and credit cards are regularly used in commercial and bankingtransactions, these are not definitive evidence of the identity of thebearer. Such documents may be altered or counterfeited or may be originallyobtained with false information. Because identification documents cannotabsolutely prove identity, ``biometric'' information (physical evidencesuch as fingerprints, retinal scans, DNA, etc.) is often used to establishpositive identity for various purposes. New technologies, such as automatedfingerprint identification systems (AFIS), have dramatically increasedthe speed and efficiency of using biometric information to establish identity.This report explores the possibility of using biometric information andbiometric technologies to identify accurately convicted felons who attemptto purchase firearms.The second issue regarding the accurate identification of convicted felonsis the quality of the criminal history data bases that would have to beaccessed to verify that a firearm purchaser was not a felon. A perfectlyaccurate criminal history data base would be up-to-date (new arrests, convictions,etc. would be entered promptly), complete (all official transactions wouldbe entered), and devoid of any inaccurate data that might, for example,show a conviction in a case that resulted in acquittal or dismissal. Theissue of accuracy and completeness of criminal history data bases is addressedin greater detail below. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. The Quality of Felony Conviction Data</ITAG>As discussed above, the congressional mandate to establish a felon identificationsystem for firearm sales requires identifying those who have been convictedof a Federal or State offense punishable by imprisonment for more than1 year (with certain exceptions). How accurate and complete are convictionrecords? To answer this question requires an examination of where and howcriminal history records are maintained.Criminal history data are maintained in either manual or automated format three different levels of government: (1) operational law enforcementor criminal justice agencies such as police, prosecutors, and courts; (2)centralized State criminal history repositories (often run by the Statepolice); and (3) the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).Within the States the criminal history repositories are responsible formaintaining complete and accurate information of official criminal justicetransactions. Such transactions include arrests for serious crimes, decisionsnot to prosecute, court dismissals, convictions and acquittals, admissionsto and releases from local jails and State prisons, and entries to andexits from probation and parole. A 1984 survey of State criminal historyrepositories conducted for the Bureau of Justice Statistics revealed thatmore than 35 million criminal history records were maintained in the States(State Criminal Records Repositories, Technical Report, Bureau of JusticeStatistics, October 1985). In 11 States the records were not automated,and in most of the others automation was only partial. Half the Statesreported that they had a fully automated name index to their criminal historyrecords, even when the records themselves were manual. Only seven Statesreported that they did not have at least a partially automated name index.A recent telephone survey of 20 States conducted for the Task Force inApril of this year showed that only 3 of the 20 States had fully automatedcriminal history records, and half the States had less than 65% of theirrecords automated (A Survey Of Twenty State Criminal History Repositories,Fisher-Orsagh Associates, June 1989). On the other hand, 14 of the 20 Stateshad fully automated name indexes to their criminal history records.Currently two telecommunications networks link law enforcement agenciesto State repositories: the National Law Enforcement TelecommunicationsSystem (NLETS) and the network supported by the National Crime InformationCenter (NCIC). The NCIC network links law enforcement agencies with theInterstate Identification Index (III) maintained by the FBI. Law enforcementagencies use computer terminals to inquire whether a criminal history recordexists for a named individual. If such a record exists in the repositoryof 1 or more of the 20 States that participate fully in the III system,the inquirer is notified and can request the criminal history record throughNCIC. In addition to pointing to State data for the 20 fully participatingStates, the NCIC system makes directly available any other criminal historyinformation from the FBI's own automated records maintained in its IdentificationDivision. These records include information from the other 30 States aswell as Federal criminal justice transactions.The FBI's Identification Division is responsible for conducting fingerprintchecks on individuals processed through the criminal justice system andon those who must pass a criminal history check for specified jobs or positions(such as Federal Government employees, child care workers in some States,etc.). These fingerprint-based criminal justice transactions form the basisfor substantial criminal history information. This information is maintainedin three basic categories at the FBI. The largest is the group of automatedcriminal history records for 12.5 million persons arrested for a fingerprintableoffense (a felony or serious misdemeanor) for the first time on or afterJuly 1, 1974. Next largest is the group of manual records for 8.8 millionpersons born in or after 1929 and arrested for a fingerprintable offensefor the first time before July 1, 1974. The smallest is the group of manualrecords for 3.6 million persons born before 1929 and arrested for a fingerprintableoffense for the first time before July 1, 1974. The FBI maintains an automatedname index both to the 12.5 million automated files and to the 8.8 millionmanual files of those born in or after 1929. There is no automated nameindex for the final group. Currently, the automated name index and theautomated files for the 12.5 million persons arrested for the first timeon or after July 1, 1974, are linked to the NCIC system. Thus, those whomake inquiries through NCIC will access these automated records but notany of the manual records maintained by the Identification Division.Given these data systems, the law enforcement official who wants immediateaccess to felony conviction data has two basic options: to access directlythe automated records maintained by his own or another State or to accessinterstate and Federal records through the NCIC system. He may, of course,do both. The problem, however, is that the conviction records accessedthrough these computerized methods are not complete.These conviction records are incomplete for two distinct reasons. First,as noted above, many records at both the State and Federal levels are notautomated. Among States recently surveyed, an average of about one-thirdof criminal history records were not automated; at the FBI the proportionis about one-half. (It should be noted, however, that the automation ofthe records of young, active offenders is much more extensive than therecords of older, less active offenders.) Second, and equally important,convictions, as well as other final dispositions, are often not reportedto the State central repository or to the FBI even when an automated recordexists of the individual's arrest. The FBI, for example, estimates thatapproximately one-half of the arrest charges in their records do not showa final disposition. Data from the 1984 survey of State repositories citedabove show that about 34% fewer final dispositions than arrests were reportedto the repositories in 1983. (Ideally, each arrest should eventually bematched by a final disposition.) In several States the proportion of underreportingwas as high as 70-80%. Moreover, the April 1989 survey of 20 States revealedthat 8 of the 17 States able to supply a figure estimated that at least20% of convictions within the State were not reported to the repository.Based on the combination of partial automation of criminal history recordsand underreporting of convictions, it is reasonable to estimate that nationwidethe records of approximately 40-60% or more of felony convictions are notcurrently available in automated form and thus not immediately accessibleby law enforcement authorities. Such a high level of undercoverage rendersimpracticable a felon identification system that relies principally onimmediate access to automated conviction records.This problem of undercoverage, however, can be significantly mitigatedif the manual records maintained by the State repositories and the FBIare accessed. There are two ways to access these manual records. One isto use the automated name index to the manual records, if one exists, toidentify a record and then manually retrieve and examine it. The other,more common, method is to do a fingerprint search based on a full 10-printfingerprint card. If a fingerprint match is found, then the manual filecan be retrieved and examined. This method is by far the more reliablesince it establishes a positive identification. Because both of these methodsrequire direct human intervention at some stage, they are not as immediateas a computer-based search of automated files. For example, the FBI currentlyrequires 14 business days to process a fingerprint card, and, dependingon the location of the requesting agency, an additional 4-10 days may berequired for mail handling. (For the sake of simplicity the rest of thereport assumes an average of 7 days for mail handling.) A new automationsystem at the FBI holds the promise of reducing fingerprint processingtime to somewhere between 2 and 10 business days, depending on a proposedexpansion of computer facilities.While accessing manual records reduces the undercoverage that exists ina search of only automated files, it does not eliminate the problem. Asindicated above, a significant proportion of final dispositions are notreported to the State repositories or to the FBI for inclusion in eitherautomated or manual records. In these cases the law enforcement officialmay be able to get the missing disposition information directly from thecourt or prosecutor's office for the jurisdiction where an arrest tookplace, but not through an on-line computer-based search. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Impediments to Creating a Perfect System</ITAG>A perfect system for immediately and accurately identifying convicted felonswho attempt to purchase firearms would have three key elements: (1) a completeand accurate automated data base showing every conviction for a State orFederal offense punishable by more than 1 year in prison and clearly showingthe specified exceptions (such as business related offenses, misdemeanorspunishable by 2 years or less in prison, convictions set aside or pardoned,and cases where civil rights were restored); (2) a means for positivelyverifying the identity of a prospective purchaser at the time of the saleof the firearm; and (3) a mechanism for immediately linking identifyinginformation about the purchaser with the information in the data base.Such a perfect system is not feasible or practical in the foreseeable future.There are several reasons for this conclusion.First, as the above discussion has shown, automated conviction recordsare too incomplete to rely on to identify convicted felons. Moreover, evenwhen conviction information is available it will not necessarily show whetherthat offense meets the Federal definition of a felony or whether the convictionwas subsequently set aside or the offender had his civil rights restored.Second, positive verification of identity at the time of the gun sale wouldnecessarily require the collection of biometric information by the gundealer. Based on the Task Force's review of state-of-the-art identificationtechnology and its survey of the capabilities of the State repositories,it appears that the only feasible way to do this is with a 10-finger livescan that digitizes the prints and then transmits the digital representationover telephone lines to repositories capable of receiving this informationand automatically searching their data bases for a match. Machines capableof collecting and digitizing a full set of prints currently cost approximately$35,000-100,000 each. This is prohibitively expensive to require of allgun dealers. If purchased by the government for use by 270,000 gun dealers,current prices would require an investment of at least $9 billion. No doubt,mass production would reduce the cost; nonetheless, the sophisticated opticsand computer hardware used in these machines would limit the cost reductions.In addition, it takes a substantial amount of training to operate one ofthese machines, thus raising questions about the logistics of training270,000 gun dealers. Moreover, because it takes about 6 minutes to geteach set of 10 prints, gun dealers that average 10 sales an hour wouldhave such a machine running constantly and would require an additionalfull-time trained employee just to operate it. This would further raisethe cost to the dealer. (Note that machines that take and digitize a single print for communicationto an external data base are much less expensive_approximately $3,000-6,000_but these are not suitable for matching a single individual to a data baseof millions of offenders. Such single-print searches are extremely computer-intensive,often requiring hours to complete, and are unreliable for proving identityin a search of a massive data base. Currently, such single-print searchesare used as an investigative tool in serious crimes to produce a list ofpossible identities or are used for security purposes to compare one individual'sprints against those already on file.)Finally, even if sophisticated AFIS technology were made available to gundealers, it would be necessary to convert and/or upgrade the technologyin most of the State repositories and the FBI so that digitized fingerprintinformation could be received and compared to fingerprint-based data bases.This would be a massive and expensive operation. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Practical Alternatives</ITAG>What, then, are the practical alternatives for establishing a reasonablyeffective system for identifying convicted felons who attempt to purchasefirearms? The Task Force has identified two different kinds of systemsthat would meet the Congressional mandate and allow for the beginning ofimplementation by December of 1989. Both types of systems would rely oncurrently available identification techniques and technologies but wouldbe open to improvements in identification documents and methods, includingthose involving biometric information. The two basic options are identifiedhere as Option A and Option B. The body of the report includes a sampleof possible modifications of these two basic options.<T3>Option A: Point-of-sale approval through a telephone check.</T3> OptionA provides for on-site, immediate access to automated name indexes maintainedby State repositories and the FBI through telephone calls to the repositoryof the State in which the sale takes place. State officials would use computerterminals tied into their State records and into the NCIC and NLETS networksto determine whether there was an arrest record either within or out ofState for someone with the name, race, sex, and date of birth of the prospectivegun purchaser. If there was no ``hit'' during this immediate verificationprocess, the gun dealer would be notified over the phone and the sale wouldbe made. If there was a ``hit,'' the sale would not be allowed at thattime. If the prospective purchaser wished to pursue the sale, he wouldseek clearance through a secondary verification process. Under this procedurefingerprints would be taken at a local law enforcement agency and sentto the State repository. A fingerprint search would be conducted by theState and then by the FBI. Any criminal history records obtained throughthe fingerprint check would be examined by State officials for an indicationof a conviction for a disqualifying offense. Incomplete information wouldbe supplemented by inquiries to courts or prosecutors' offices. If no evidenceof a conviction for a disqualifying offense was found, a Certificate toPurchase would be issued to the prospective buyer (valid for up to 1 year).The purchaser would present this documentation to the gun dealer certifyinghis eligibility. The entire secondary verification process could take as long as 4-6 weeks.It is estimated, however, that approximately 84-88% of prospective gunpurchasers would successfully pass the initial verification and thus wouldnot have to go through the secondary verification. Reasonable modificationsof this system might reduce some of the burdens placed on the eligiblepurchaser.<T3>Option B: Firearm Owner's Identification Card.</T3> Option B is essentiallythe same as the secondary verification of Option A. The difference is thateveryone who wanted to purchase a firearm would go through a fingerprint-basedclearance process. If there was no evidence of a felony conviction, asdefined by Federal law, the State would issue a Firearm Owner's Identification(FOID) Card valid for up to 3 years. This card would be presented wheneverthe bearer wished to purchase a firearm. The chief advantage of OptionB over Option A is that it eliminates the problem of the false ``hits''that occur in a name-based automated criminal history check because ofmistaken identity. This option also has several disadvantages. The chiefdisadvantage is that it puts every prospective gun purchaser through a4-6-week clearance procedure every several years. It also places much greaterdemands than Option A on existing criminal justice identification systemsand is thus considerably more expensive.The Task Force has also identified a variety of higher-technology variantsof these two basic options. They are summarized here.<T3>Option A1: Computer terminal access by gun dealer to disqualifyinginformation.</T3> This option would replace the telephone calls of OptionA with direct computer terminal access to an intermediary computer thatwould review the State and Federal criminal history indexes and transmitnotices of approval or denial to the dealer. This would be considerablymore expensive than Option A in the short run and would present no particularoperational advantages over it.<T3>Option A2: Touch-tone telephone access by gun dealer to disqualifyinginformation.</T3> This option is similar to Option A1 but substitutes atouch-tone telephone for computer access. Like Option A1 it is more complicatedand expensive than Option A, at least in the short run, without any correspondingadvantages. It is possible that in the long run Options A1 and A2 wouldbe less expensive than Option A by reducing the need for computer operatorsat the State repository to respond to the calls from the gun dealers.<T3>Option A3: Live scan of fingerprints by gun dealer.</T3> This option,requiring that fingerprints be taken directly at the point of sale anddigitized for transmission to the record repository, is similar to thebiometrically-based system described previously in the discussion of aperfect felon identification system. While it would provide the greatestassurance of a positive identification, it would be the most difficultand expensive to implement.<T3>Option A4: Biometric identification card.</T3> This option is not somuch an alternative to the basic Option A as an additional feature thatcould be added to it. Under this option positive identification would beenhanced at the gun dealership by the comparison of a single fingerprintof the prospective purchaser with digitized information from a biometrically-basedidentification card issued by the State. <T3>Option B1: Live scan of fingerprints by local law enforcement and biometriccheck by gun dealer.</T3> This option combines elements of both prior approvaland immediate check. Prospective gun purchasers would go to a designatedlaw enforcement agency for a criminal history clearance. The agency wouldconduct a live 10-print fingerprint scan using AFIS equipment (as in OptionA3). The digitized fingerprint information would be transmitted to theState repository and the FBI to check for arrest and conviction records.Applicants who passed this clearance would be issued a FOID card. Thosewishing to purchase a firearm would present the FOID card to the gun dealer.Equipment at the dealership would allow a comparison of a single fingerprintfrom the purchaser to digitized information on the card (as in Option A4).<T3>Option B2: Smart card containing disqualifying information.</T3> Underthis option every adult would carry an identification card issued by theState of residence, such as a driver's license, that would have electronicallyimprinted identifying information, including biometric data and informationsuch as felony convictions that would legally bar someone from purchasinga firearm. At the gun dealership such a card would be placed into a readerto verify identification (by comparison with a single fingerprint) andto determine whether the bearer was prohibited from purchasing a firearm.<ITAG tagnum="81">F. Cost Estimates</ITAG>All of the options detailed here would place substantial new demands onFederal and State criminal history repositories and law enforcement agencies.In the few months that the Task Force has been operating it has not beenpossible to develop precise estimates of the cost implications of eachof the options. Nonetheless, some broad estimates have been derived. Theseshould be taken only as a general indication of the cost implications ofa felon identification system. They are conservative estimates that mayhave to be revised upward as the implications for local, State, and Federalpractice are more fully explored. Option A, which is judged to be the least expensive of the various possibilities,would have projected combined local, State, and Federal start-up costsof $36-44 million. Annual operating expenses would be an estimated $53-70million. Other variants of Option A would cost some additional amount overthe base system. (There is the possibility, however, that a more fullyautomated system that electronically connected gun dealers to the necessarydisabling information would in the long run prove less expensive than OptionA by reducing ongoing personnel costs.)Option B, the basic pre-approval system, would have total estimated start-upcosts of $148-153 million, and additional annual operating costs of $136-161million. The two other variants of Option B would likely cost considerablymore.Note that if existing criminal history checks for gun purchasers are takeninto account, the actual new cost would be somewhat lower than these estimates_perhaps8-12% less for operational costs.Part, or all, of these costs might be recouped by charging the gun purchasera special fee. Assuming 7.5 million gun purchases per year, a fee in therange of $7-9 per firearm might cover the annual operating costs of OptionA (although not the start-up costs). Assuming 6 million FOID cards issuedin the first year under Option B and 5 million issued each subsequent year,a fee in the range of $27-32 per application would be necessary to coverannual operating costs.The following summarizes cost information for the two basic options andthose higher-technology variants for which enough information was availableto approximate at least partial system costs:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,11,11</C> <H1>Options</H1><H1>Start-up costs (millions)</H1><H1>Annual operating costs (millions)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">A: Telephone check by gun dealer <D>$36-44 </D><D>$53-70</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A3: Live scan of fingerprints by all gun dealers <D>9,590-27,144 </D><D>3,047-8,347</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A4: Biometric identification card checked by all gun dealers <D>198-368 </D><D>102-168</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">B: FOID card <D>148-153 </D><D>136-161</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">B1: Live scan by law enforcement and biometric check by all gun dealers<D>344-572 </D><D>203-295</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">G. Implementation issues</ITAG>There are four broad possibilities for implementing a felon identificationsystem: (1) To create a self-standing Federal system that is run entirelyby Federal officials; (2) to mandate a cooperative Federal-State systemin which State officials carry out a substantial portion of the criminalhistory checks; (3) to establish a mandatory Federal standard that Statescould meet in a variety of different ways; and (4) to offer the Statesseveral models for a cooperative Federal-State system and make Federalresources and leadership available to assist the States.(1) The Task Force did not focus its research efforts on the creation ofan independent Federal system because 90% or more of arrests and convictionsin the United States are handled by State and local officials. Becauseof the variety of State laws, practices, and data systems, only State officialsare in a position to properly interpret criminal history record informationfor their State and to determine whether a conviction meets the Federalstandard for disallowing a firearm purchase. Moreover, State officialsare in the best position to track down missing or incomplete informationwith local courts or prosecutors. Thus, the active involvement of Stateofficials in the criminal history checks would seem essential to an effectivefelon identification system.(2) Given the necessity for active State involvement, the Federal governmentcould create a felon identification system by mandating that the Statesadopt a particular system, such as one of those detailed here or a modificationthereof. Under this implementation strategy, the Federal government wouldselect a felon identification system and each State would be required towork with Federal officials to implement it. The result would be a uniformsystem in each of the 50 States.(3) Another possible implementation plan is to allow variation across theStates in the kind of system established as long as each State's systemmet certain minimum Federal standards. As noted above, 20 States and theDistrict of Columbia (covering more than half of the Nation's population)currently conduct some kind of criminal history check for those who wishto purchase handguns. There is, however, substantial variation among thesesystems. In some States checks are conducted by local authorities; in othersby State authorities. Some States access only State records when conductingthe check; others also access Federal records. A few States require fingerprints;most do not. Of these existing systems, some might be as effective as theoptions detailed in this report in keeping convicted felons from purchasingfirearms through legitimate retail outlets. Others might be easily upgraded.All of the options presented in this report meet at least two minimum standards:all firearm purchases from Federally licensed dealers are covered, anda name check of both State and Federal automated data bases is conductedfor evidence of an arrest for a serious crime (such checks usually alsoinclude date of birth, race, and sex). It appears that only four Statesand the District of Columbia currently meet both standards. (4) Finally, the Federal Government could take a leadership role in designingone or more felon identification systems and in encouraging, but not mandating,State cooperation. Under this strategy the Federal Government would expandits own resources at the FBI and BATF to make such a system(s) possibleand would provide expertise and technical assistance to State and localofficials.<ITAG tagnum="81">H. Legal and policy issues</ITAG>Whatever option is chosen, new legislation would be required to addressa number of issues: (1) To mandate a specific system on the States, toestablish minimum Federal standards, or to base a system on voluntary complianceby the States; (2) to establish the funding mechanism for carrying outthe criminal history checks, possibly involving user fees by gun purchasers;(3) (under some options) to authorize the release of limited criminal historyinformation to gun dealers (e.g., whether there is a ``hit'' on a namesearch of automated arrest records); (4) to specify penalties for gun dealerswho improperly disclose criminal history information obtained as part ofa felon identification system; (5) to determine the minimum acceptablelevel of accuracy for the system; (6) to establish a statutory right ofappeal for the prospective gun purchaser from any adverse decision, includingthe right to inspect records; and (7) to set forth policy regarding theuse of information generated by a felon identification system, includingany fingerprint data collected. (This is an illustrative, not an exhaustive,list.)<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Solving the problem of felons acquiring firearms</ITAG>In evaluating the various possibilities for identifying convicted felonswho attempt to purchase firearms, it must be recognized that even a perfectfelon identification system would not keep most felons from acquiring firearms.One study of convicted offenders in State prisons found that about five-sixthsof those who admitted to ownership of a firearm claimed to have acquiredthe weapon through some means other than purchase through a retail outlet(<T3>The Armed Criminal in America,</T3> National Institute of Justice,November 1986). These other means included the black market, thefts, andinformal transactions with friends or associates such as a purchase ortrade. An effective felon identification system will do little to eliminateor reduce these off-the-record transactions. Indeed, a particularly effectivesystem may force even more felons to turn to the black market for theirweapons or to use accomplices without a criminal record to purchase gunsfor them. Nonetheless, a system that keeps felons from purchasing weaponsover the counter may at least increase the difficulty, and perhaps thecosts, of acquiring weapons for use in crime and may, in fact, deny weaponsto some number of less sophisticated criminals unable to access the blackmarket or to find willing accomplices. II. Options for a Felon Identification System<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Section 1. Schematic Overview</ITAG>In considering the design of a system for identifying felons who attemptto purchase firearms, it is useful to begin with a general overview ofthe basic components. Any final system would be comprised of an approvalprocedure, a designated processing organization, access to data sources,a designated decision organization, final action, and an appeals process.Different systems are basically different combinations of options amongthese components. (See Exhibit 1.)<T3>Approval procedures. </T3>Approval to purchase a firearm may occureither prior to an individual's trip to a gun dealer or at the point ofsale in the shop. Prior approval schemes include the issuance of: (1) Anidentification card, which establishes in advance that the individual iseligible to purchase a firearm, (2) a certificate to purchase, which permitsan individual to purchase a firearm for a limited period, or (3) a smartcard on which basic data are encoded that establish an individual's eligibility.Point-of-sale approval procedures may involve telephone checks by the gundealer of criminal history records through local or State law enforcementagencies or a regional office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.Direct checks of data bases could also be made over touch-tone telephonelines: dealers would access data with a series of identifying numbers andreceive approval or denial from a State or Federal computer system. Dealerscould also make electronic checks through terminals or automated biometricdevices with direct lines to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC)and State criminal history repositories.<T3>Processing organizations. </T3>Identification systems for firearm purchasesmay employ one or more organizations that process an application and searchthe criminal history data bases. For example, applicants may be requiredto appear in person at a local law enforcement agency, such as the policeor sheriff's department, to obtain a permit or identification card. Thisagency would search local files and access State or Federal files throughthe NCIC and NLETS communication systems. Alternatively, the applicantcould apply at the point of sale, and the gun dealer would call a local,State, or Federal agency to receive approval for the sale. A slightly differentsystem could designate the regional offices of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobaccoand Firearms as processing agents for firearms applications and as conduitsthrough which access is gained to State or Federal data bases. Finally, a wholly separate agency could be established at the State orregional level to function as a Felon Identification Center.<T3>Data sources. </T3>Currently, two basic sources of criminal historydata (State and Federal) can be accessed to determine if an applicant hasa disqualifying conviction. Any system of identification for firearm purchasesmust specify which data bases are to be used and how they will be accessed.Most States maintain a repository of criminal history record information(CHRI); in a few States the repository is maintained by a municipalityor consortium of local law enforcement agencies. States also maintain ``hotfiles,'' listing outstanding wants and warrants. The degree of automationof the CHRI files varies considerably from State to State: some repositoriesare completely automated, others partially automated, and a few Statesmaintain only paper files.Criminal history data and ``hot files'' are also maintained at the Federallevel within NCIC and the Identification Division of the FBI. The Federalfiles contain records from the applicant's State of residence as well asFederal and out-of-State records. These records may be accessed throughfingerprint searches (via the mail) or through electronic name and date-of-birthsearches (via NCIC access to the Interstate Identification Index [III]).Finally, a new data source could be created for the specific purpose ofidentifying individuals with disqualifying convictions and other individualsprohibited from buying firearms. A national center, for example, couldcreate and maintain an index, which would merge indexes from current Stateand Federal data bases, mental health records, and records kept by theImmigration and Naturalization Service. This national index of individualsprohibited from purchasing firearms would be updated continuously. It wouldserve as the sole data source for Federal regulation of firearm purchases.<T3>Decision organizations. </T3>Once the processing organization has checkedthe data bases, the data must be interpreted and a decision made. The processingorganization may not necessarily be the decision organization. Local lawenforcement may evaluate the data or rely on the State police or identificationbureau to do so. In response to problems of evaluating out-of-State andFederal records, other system designs may designate regional or Federalagencies as the decision organization.<T3>Action. </T3>The designated decision organization must either approveor prohibit an individual from purchasing a firearm. Depending on the typeof approval system, the organization would transmit the decision to theapplicant directly or through the gun dealer. Potential options includeissuance of a card, a certificate, a notice of denial, or an electronicmessage of approval or denial.<T3>Appeals process. </T3>Once an applicant receives final notice thatthe application has been denied, he may appeal this decision. The designatedappeals organization may be the local police, a State agency, a regionaloffice of BATF, or some other agency. Legislation may also establish aright to a judicial appeal once administrative appeals are exhausted. <T3>Basic options and variants. </T3>Although there are numerous possiblecombinations among these components, the Task Force has detailed two basicoptions: Option A, which is a point-of-sale telephone check by gun dealerswith secondary verification, and Option B, which is a pre-approval systemrequiring a firearm owner's identification card. The descriptions presentedhere specify for each basic option the type of approval procedure, theprocessing organization, the data sources, and the final decision organization.There is additional discussion of specific characteristics, estimates ofvolume, cost figures, advantages and disadvantages, and potential modifications.Each basic option is followed by several higher-technology variants.<ITAG tagnum="81">II. B. Section 2. Point-of-Sale Approval Systems</ITAG><T3>(1) Option A: Telephone check by gun dealer with secondary verification.</T3>A cooperative Federal and State system would be established requiring thatgun dealers obtain clearance from a designated law enforcement agency atthe time of sale of all firearms. This system would include both (1) Animmediate telephone check of automated criminal history records by gundealers through a designated law enforcement agency and (2) a secondaryfingerprint-based verification procedure for all individuals rejected throughthe initial telephone check. Each system would have the following elements:<T3>Telephone check (Exhibit 2).</T3> 1. At the time of purchase each gundealer would require the buyer to fill out an application and show twopieces of identification, with at least one having a current photo.2. The gun dealer would be required to telephone a State law enforcementagency for a criminal records check. Appropriate security procedures (suchas a call-back procedure or password system combined with additional dealeridentification and access codes) would be introduced to protect againstunauthorized entry and dissemination.3. The designated State law enforcement agency would access existing telecommunicationsnetworks to check the master name index within the State of purchase andthe FBI's Automated Identification System_Phase III (AIS-III). The AIS-IIIindex contains pointers to the Interstate Identification Index (III) forout-of-State arrests. Both State and Federal ``hot'' files would also bechecked.4. Initial checks would be made of the State and Federal master name indexes.These indexes contain identifying information on persons previously arrestedfor ``printable'' offenses (felonies and serious misdemeanors). Since theseare arrest-based indexes, some of the applicants found on these indexes(e.g., those arrested for a felony but not convicted, those convicted ofmisdemeanors only, and those who were pardoned) will be qualified to purchasefirearms. In those States in which criminal history files are automated,it may be possible to access and evaluate individual files while the gundealer remains on the phone. It may also be possible to access similarlyand evaluate some out-of-State records. (Note that currently several hoursare often required to obtain records for individuals arrested in the 20III States.)5. The gun dealer would immediately (i.e., within a few minutes) receivenotice of permission or denial of sale from the designated law enforcementagency. The dealer would receive a transaction number for each inquiryand be required to record the number on each application. Regardless ofwhether or not the sale was made, the dealer would be required to retaina copy of the application and a record of the telephone inquiry. The designatedlaw enforcement agency would retain records of all inquiries for use inaudits of gun dealers. Names of applicants would not be retained on theinquiry data base.6. If the sale was denied, the gun dealer would instruct the applicantthat a Certificate to Purchase may be obtained from a local law enforcementagency.<T3>Secondary verification (Exhibit 3).</T3> 1. An applicant who previouslyfailed a telephone check would be required to appear in person, with twopieces of identification, at a law enforcement agency within the jurisdictionof the applicant's legal residence.2. Each applicant would be fingerprinted, and the fingerprint cards wouldbe mailed to the State criminal history repository.3. The State agency would access in-State automated and manual criminalhistory records and also send the fingerprint cards to the FBI for a checkof out-of-State records.4. If an FBI rap sheet was found for the applicant, the State agency wouldreceive by mail a copy of the records maintained by the FBI's IdentificationDivision. These records would include Federal criminal justice transactionsas well as transactions in the 30 States that do not participate in theInterstate Identification Index (III). Additional information from non-IIIparticipating States could be sought directly from these States throughNLETS. If the applicant had been arrested in a III participating State,as indicated by the FBI records, the State agency would request via NCICadditional records from such a State. If the records so obtained were insufficientlycomplete to make a final determination of eligibility (e.g., lacking dispositiondata), additional information could be sought by telephone or mail inquiryto the relevant courts or prosecutors' offices.5. Based on all the available information, the State agency would makea determination whether there was evidence of a disqualifying convictionand issue either a Certificate to Purchase or a Notice of Denial. The Certificateto Purchase would be valid for no more than 1 year. The designated Stateagency would maintain a data base of all certificates issued. Individualscould renew their certificates by submitting a written application_no fingerprintswould be required. Names of individuals not renewing their certificateswould be purged from the data base at the end of 1 year.6. Copies of the Certificate to Purchase or Notice of Denial would be sentto the applicant and to the local law enforcement agency submitting thefingerprint card.7. If a Notice of Denial was issued, the applicant would be informed ofhis right to appeal (see Part II, Section 4.)8. If the applicant possessed a Certificate to Purchase and decided topurchase a firearm, the gun dealer would be required to verify, prior tosale, the identity of the purchaser_through two pieces of identification_andthe validity of the certificate_by calling the designated State agencyto check the validity of the Certificate to Purchase against the certificatedata base.<T3>Data sources.</T3>The initial telephone check would scan the Stateand Federal automated name indexes and would access whatever automatedrap sheet data could be immediately retrieved. Access to this informationwould be through a designated law enforcement agency only. (See Part IV,Section 3 and Exhibit 4 for an overview of national access to criminalhistory files.)Obtaining a complete check of out-of-State records would require expandingthe FBI's Automated Identification System-Phase III (AIS-III), which isaccessed through the NCIC telecommunications network. Currently, only thoseindividuals first arrested on or after July 1, 1974, are listed in theAIS-III master name index (approximately 12.5 million persons). The recordsof approximately 8.8 million individuals born in or after 1929 but arrestedbefore July 1, 1974, are not currently accessible through the NCIC network.In general, the current name indexes to criminal history data at the Stateand Federal level are arrest-based data sets only, containing identifyinginformation on individuals arrested for felonies and serious misdemeanors.In some instances, for example, if the charges are dropped or if the individualis acquitted or pardoned, States may purge the indexes of these names.With few exceptions, these indexes do not contain information on convictions.The secondary verification procedure utilizes all criminal history databases at the State and Federal levels, including automated and manual records.In addition these may be supplemented by direct queries to courts and prosecutors'offices. State law enforcement officials, who are in the best positionto interpret criminal history records, will determine whether there issufficient evidence of a conviction that meets the Federal standard fordisqualification.An inquiry data base would be created and maintained by the designatedState agency. This data base would record basic information on all inquiriesfrom the gun dealers. For each inquiry, a dealer's license number, a transactionnumber and date, and an outcome code (i.e., approval or denial) would berecorded. This information would be used by BATF for subsequent auditsof gun dealers. Names of applicants would not be retained in this database.This data base containing a list of the Certificates to Purchase and Noticesof Denial would also be created and maintained by the designated Stateagency. This data base would contain basic information on individual applicantswho had previously received a Certificate to Purchase or Notice of Denial.It would contain an applicant's name, date of birth, race, sex, a flagindicating approval or denial, and (when appropriate) a number assignedto the Certificate to Purchase. The data base could be updated continuouslyfor subsequent disqualifying convictions. After 1 year the Certificateto Purchase would expire. A new certificate would be issued if the applicantsubmitted a renewal form and passed subsequent State and NCIC checks. Identifyinginformation on all other holders would be removed from the data base after1 year. This data base would be used by the State agency to verify thevalidity of certificates at time of purchase. The data base would alsobe used to detect those individuals who were issued a Certificate to Purchasebut who were subsequently convicted of a disqualifying offense.This data base would also contain names of individuals issued a Noticeof Denial. Such a data base could detect repeated attempts by disqualifiedapplicants to purchase a firearm. Criminal penalties could then be leviedagainst those individuals who attempted to purchase a firearm after receivinga Notice of Denial.<T3>Verification and controls.</T3> Gun dealers would be required to maintaincopies of approved applications and logs of inquiries. However, gun dealerswould not keep copies of rejected applications, which would be sent tothe State. Dealers would receive a transaction number for each inquiryand be required to retain this number for subsequent audits. No sale couldbe made without this number. The designated State law enforcement agencywould be required to maintain records on all inquiries.Gun dealers would be subject to criminal penalties for any false inquiryor disclosure of any information received from a telephone check.Procedures would be adopted to verify the identity of gun dealers to theState agency. A call-back procedure could be used; for example, the gundealer would call the State agency, provide the dealer codes (includingdealer identifiers from State or Federal licenses), hang up the phone,and wait for a return call from the State agency. An alternative procedureis a single-call method, with a variable password system and dealer codeslinked to a data base maintained by the State agency.<T3>Positive identification. </T3>Positive identification of applicantsby gun dealers prior to the initial telephone check will be limited bythe quality of identification documents presented and by the range of dataelements accessible on the State and Federal master name indexes. Currently,searches of the automated indexes are limited primarily to the applicant'sname, date of birth, race, and sex. The use of additional data elements,such as place of birth, scars and marks, height, weight, eye and hair color,and miscellaneous numbers (e.g., social security number or driver's licensenumber), depends on whether they appear on existing master name indexesand on their use and accuracy on identification documents. Despite problemsof identifying individuals based on name and date of birth, numerous Statescurrently conduct name-based checks on gun applicants. (See Part IV, Section2 for a description of current State practices in conducting criminal historychecks of prospective firearm purchasers.)Additional efforts to ensure positive identification by the dealer at thetime of purchase could include placement of the applicant's fingerprinton the application form (BATF form 4473, Exhibit 5). The dealer could rollthe print of the applicant's right index finger at time of application.Though this print would not be submitted to the State identification bureau,it may serve as a deterrent to those possessing fraudulent identificationcards. In the future the print on the application could be used in combinationwith an identification card containing a similar print. (See Option A3for further elaboration of fingerprint checks by dealers.)Even if positive identification could be established by the dealers, theState agency would face problems of ``multiple hits'' (more than one personon the name index with a similar name, date of birth, sex, and race) and``false hits'' (a person on the name index other than the applicant witha name and date of birth similar to the applicant's). Estimates obtainedfrom the FBI, detailed below, indicate that approximately 50% of the caseswhere persons appear to have a criminal history record based on an initialname search are eventually found to be false hits.Procedures similar to those employed in Illinois (see Part II, Section2) may be adopted to reduce the number of false hits. Illinois uses placeof birth and additional identifying features such as eye color, hair color,height, and weight to reduce identification problems. The more identifyinginformation used, the less likely there is to be a false hit.<T3>Estimates of volume. </T3>Figures obtained from the Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms indicate that approximately 7.5 million new and usedfirearms are sold annually. This figure represents a 10-year average ofdomestic firearms production (adjusting for imports and exports) plus usedgun sales (estimated at about 50% of all sales of new firearms). The 7.5million annual purchases is equivalent to a daily average of more than20,000 sales. Since many stores are likely to be closed on Sundays andto be busier on Saturdays than mid-week and since firearm sales increaseduring hunting season, the number of sales may reach as high as 50,000on peak days.Assuming that a name check will be conducted prior to every purchase, thenumber of inquiries into the Interstate Identification Index (AIS-III)would increase by approximately 70% from the current level of 10.7 millioninquiries a year. However, relative to all inquiries received daily byNCIC, including ``hot'' files as well as AIS-III inquiries, name checksof gun applicants would increase the total number of inquiries by about5% at the peak time during hunting season. The 50,000 additional inquiriesresulting from gun applicants are small relative to the recent 1-day recordof 1.1 million inquiries into NCIC.The number of additional fingerprint cards would vary depending on thehit rate from the name check. This rate can only be estimated indirectly.Assuming that the final hit rate on gun applicants will resemble the ratefor fingerprint-based checks currently conducted by the FBI on applicantcards, an estimated 6-8% of all applicants will be rejected. (There arecurrently no National data on ultimate rejection rates for gun applicants.)Further, if half of all initial hits in a name and date-of-birth checkof gun applicants are false hits (based on FBI estimates for all applicants),then the expected initial hit rate should be between 12% and 16% for allgun applicants. Finally, not all of the initially-rejected applicants maysubmit fingerprints for the secondary verification_perhaps 10-14% of allapplicants will submit fingerprint cards.The number of applicants for a Certificate to Purchase will be less thanthe number of purchases, since applicants may buy more than one firearma year. Precise counts of the annual number of purchases per buyer do notexist. However, if we assume that the majority of applicants will buy onlyone firearm and a relatively small number will buy many firearms, the estimateof 1.25 firearms per buyer may be a reasonable expectation. Such an estimatesuggests that an estimated 6 million individuals buy the 7.5 million firearmssold annually.As a result of the above assumptions, we may expect approximately 725,000fingerprint cards on gun applicants as a result of a rejection from thetelephone inquiry by the dealer. Assuming the current 5-day week at theFBI's Identification Division, this represents an additional 3,000 fingerprintcards per day_an increase of nearly 10% in the number of cards receiveddaily.<T3>Additional system flows. </T3>The estimate of 7.5 million new namesearches of automated records and 725,000 new fingerprint checks that wouldbe generated by this option ignores the fact that many States currentlyconduct criminal history checks of gun purchasers. Twenty-two States andthe District of Columbia (covering more than half of the Nation's population)now conduct a pre- or post-purchase criminal history check. Thirteen Statesand D.C. access Federal and interstate records through NCIC. Six Statesand D.C. take fingerprints. Four States and D.C. include the purchase ofall types of firearms; the others, only handguns.Presumably, if Option A were adopted, the new criminal history checks wouldnot be conducted on top of existing checks, for this would create an unnecessaryredundancy. Either (1) States would modify their existing systems and criminalhistory checks to conform to the elements of Option A, or (2) the Federalmandate would accept current pre-approval systems as effectively accomplishingthe goals of Option A if certain minimum standards were met. In eithercase if current practice is taken into account, the net new impact on Federaland State repositories would be somewhat less than the estimate of 7.5million new name searches of automated records and 725,000 new fingerprintchecks.Criminal history checks of gun purchasers currently conducted by the Statesaccount for approximately 15% of the projected 7.5 million annual inquiriesinto NCIC under Option A and 8% of the 725,000 fingerprint checks at theFBI. As a result, the additional impact of Option A on NCIC and the FBIIdentification Division is estimated at 6.4 million inquiries and 664,000additional fingerprint cards. At the State level current practices accountfor a somewhat greater proportion of the inquiries required by this option.An estimated 20% of the total 7.5 million name and date-of-birth searchesprojected for State identification bureaus under Option A are currentlyconducted. Consequently, 6.0 million additional inquiries would be requiredat the State level under Option A.Finally, as a result of the proposed expansion of the AIS-III index, theFBI's Identification Division would also need to respond to requests forrecords on the 8.8 million individuals who were born in or after 1929 butarrested for the first time before July 1, 1974. Expansion of this indexwould necessitate the assembly, retrieval, and mailing of an estimated4,000 manual files daily (including 3,000 files to meet anticipated criminaljustice requests plus 1,000 files for firearm applicants).<T3>Identifying convicted felons.</T3> In many, perhaps most, cases theactual criminal history record of an applicant would be examined only whena fingerprint card is submitted. For an estimated 80-90% of all prospectivepurchasers, a check would only be made for the existence of a criminalrecord. For the applicants who were identified by a name and date-of-birthsearch and who subsequently submitted fingerprints, a more complete assessmentof the record would be required.The difficulty of accurately identifying a convicted felon varies fromState to State. In some States felony identification is automated: a felonyconviction flag exists in the record. In other States felony identificationis obtained from the State statutory code listed for each conviction offense.Interpretation of this code is typically achieved manually, unless a computerprogram exists to automatically classify statutory codes as either felonyor non-felony offenses. In other States felony identification is only sometimespossible. In these States a felony may be determined when a convictionis unambiguously a felony (such as murder or rape) or when a free textfield exists and the word felony appears in the field. The issue is furthercomplicated by the fact that the State definition of a felony may not correspondwith the definition in the Gun Control Act (an act punishable by imprisonmentfor more than 1 year.)The task of accurately interpreting criminal history records is even moredifficult when an applicant has been arrested in States other than thecurrent State of residence. FBI records do not contain sufficient informationto identify felons or those convicted of crimes punishable by imprisonmentfor more than 1 year. FBI offense codes are typically recorded as literals(free text) or as numeric NCIC codes. State statutes and text containingthe word ``felony'' are only infrequently reported.Faced with these difficulties, States currently conducting criminal historysearches on gun applicants employ three strategies: (1) Infer a felonyconviction based on sentencing data (e.g., if the record contains a sentenceto incarceration of greater than 1 year, the applicant is identified asa felon); (2) obtain more detailed out-of-State records via NCIC or NLETS,which may designate conviction offenses as felonies; and (3) infer a felonyconviction from a literal description.<T3>Response times. </T3>The initial telephone check would be immediate,within minutes, assuming sufficient resources. Electronic searches of Stateand Federal master name indexes could be conducted while the gun dealerremained on the line. Among the 20 State identification bureaus surveyedfor the Task Force by Fisher-Orsagh Associates, the average in-house responsetime for a non-fingerprint search utilizing a terminal is about 20 seconds(A Survey Of Twenty State Criminal History Repositories, Fisher-OrsaghAssociates, June 1989). Additional minutes would be needed if the Stateagency attempted to reduce the number of false hits by requesting additionalinformation from the gun dealer. An additional 30 seconds would be requiredfor an NCIC check of the AIS-III index.The secondary verification procedure would require approximately 4-6 weeksto complete. Existing searches based on fingerprint cards at the FBI'sIdentification Division are processed within 14 working days. An estimated7 days would also be required for submission of fingerprint cards via themail and return of FBI rap sheets to the State agency. Some additionaltime would be necessary for evaluating criminal history records by thedesignated State agency, including, if necessary, calls to courts or prosecutors'offices.The response time for secondary verification may be reduced once currentautomation procedures at the FBI are fully in place. The FBI anticipatesthat response times will be reduced to somewhere between 2 and 10 days,depending on a proposed expansion of their computer system.Estimates for fingerprint searches conducted by State criminal historyrepositories, which would be simultaneous with the FBI checks, indicatea total response time for a criminal justice inquiry of 3 to 23 workingdays, including mail turn-around time. In the 20 States examined by Fisher-OrsaghAssociates, the average response time for a fingerprint search was 5 days,assuming the search was for a criminal justice purpose. For non-criminal-justicesearches the average increased to a total of 9 days. No significant reductionin this response time is expected in the near future.<T3>Costs. </T3>Of all options, the telephone check with a secondary verificationmay be the least expensive to implement and operate. Costs are kept downby using existing technologies, telecommunication systems, and data sources.Costs are further reduced by limiting fingerprint checks only to thoseindividuals appearing on the master name indexes and by creating a State-leveldata base of Certificates to Purchase and Notices of Denial.For the telephone checks only, the total estimated cost at the State andlocal level includes a start-up cost of $14.3-$17.7 million and an additionalannual operating cost of $30.0-$39.4 million. The estimated cost of thesecondary verification would include a start-up cost of $8.6 million andan annual operating cost of $10.4-$13.3 million. The combined cost forthe telephone checks and secondary verification at the State and locallevel would be between $22.8 and $26.2 million in start-up costs and between$40.3 and $52.6 million in annual operating costs. (For more detailed costfigures, see Exhibit 6 and Estimates of Start-up And Operational CostsOf Systems For Identifying Felons Who Attempt To Purchase Firearms, Fisher-OrsaghAssociates, June 1989.)At the Federal level the combined cost for the telephone check and secondaryverification is estimated at $12.7-$17.8 million a year. The start-up costis estimated at $13.1-$17.3 million.When local, State, and Federal costs are added together, the total estimatedannual operating cost for Option A ranges from $53 million to $70 millionand the total estimated start-up cost ranges from $36 million to $44 million.Note that if existing criminal history checks for gun purchasers are takeninto account, the actual new cost may be somewhat lower than these estimates_perhaps11-13% lower for operational and start-up costs. On the other hand, theseestimates do not include any costs to dealers for new phone lines or staffor to local police for their part in the secondary verification.A substantial portion of the operating costs could be transferred to theindividual applicant through fees for all gun purchases, whether or nota fingerprint search is performed. Given the total annual cost estimates,a fee of $7.07-$9.39 per applicant per purchase would be required to coverlocal, State, and Federal costs. <T3>Impact. </T3>1. <T3>Purchasers: </T3>The vast majority of individuals without criminalrecords would have the immediate ability to purchase a firearm. Exceptfor individuals falsely rejected by the search of the master name indexes,those without criminal records would not be burdened by pre-approval procedures.2. <T3>Dealers: </T3>In addition to current application procedures, dealerswould be required to make a telephone call prior to every purchase andto create and maintain a log of all inquiries. The time necessary to makethe checks is expected to average about 3 minutes per sale. An additionaltelephone line may be required for some dealers. Among high-volume dealers,additional staff may be required to handle multiple checks simultaneouslywithout generating long waiting lines at the gun shop.3. <T3>Local law enforcement: </T3>Local law enforcement agencies would processan estimated 725,000 applications and fingerprint cards a year as a resultof the secondary verification procedures. This work load may require someadditional staff and funds for agencies currently working at peak levels.4. <T3>State law enforcement: </T3>The State identification agency or otherdesignated agency for applicant checks would experience a large increasein its work load. To process the estimated 7.5 million telephone inquiries,States would need new communications lines, staff to respond to inquiries,additional office space, computer terminals to access the State mastername indexes, and software to build the inquiry data base. State identificationbureaus would also require a 7-day work week with longer hours (or 6 daysif gun sales were prohibited on Sundays).To process the estimated 10% increase in fingerprint cards, States wouldrequire funds, staff, space, and software to maintain a data base on theCertificates to Purchase. (See <T3>A Survey Of Twenty State Criminal History Repositories, </T3>Fisher-OrsaghAssociates, June 1989, for the ability of specific States to handle a 10%increase in in-house searches of their criminal history files.) Statesmay also be required to establish an administrative appeals procedure forchallenging adverse decisions.5. <T3>NCIC and FBI Identification Division: </T3>The NCIC communicationssystem would experience a minor increase in volume_an increase of 5% ona peak day during hunting season. To process this increase in volume, 16additional lines plus an enhancement to the front-end capacity on the NCICcomputers will be required. The number of additional inquiries into theAIS-III computer, however, would increase by approximately 70%. To handlethis increase, the AIS-III computer must be significantly enhanced. Thetelephone search would also require additional staff at the FBI's IdentificationDivision to process requests for the 8.8 million manual records of offendersarrested for the first time before July 1, 1974, and born in or after 1929.The manual records would be requested through NCIC for all criminal justicepurposes and mailed to the requesting agency by the FBI IdentificationDivision. Based on the estimated 725,000 fingerprint cards submitted annually andthe 4,000 daily requests for manual files through NCIC, approximately 395additional employees may be needed by the Identification Division as aresult of Option A. An estimated 126 of these employees would be technical(e.g., fingerprint technicians, classifiers, and verifiers) and 212 wouldbe typists; all of these would require 3-6 months of training. The FBIwould require 12-18 months to recruit and clear these 395 new employees.These new employees would require nearly 8,000 square feet of additionaloffice space.<T3>Impact of AFIS technology on secondary verification. </T3>At the presenttime the FBI and more than half of the States either have an automatedfingerprint identification system (AFIS) or are in the process of procuringsuch a system. These systems, as currently utilized, require techniciansto classify the prints according to pattern type; the prints are then scanned,digitized, and matched against prints from an AFIS data base. (Note thatnew AFIS equipment has recently been introduced that automates the classificationprocess, but this is not yet a proven technology.) At the end of the matchingprocess, a list of all potential identification candidates is produced,and a technician visually compares the print to the corresponding listand makes the identification decision. (See ``Appendix'' to <T3>Legal And Policy Issues Relating To Biometric Identification Technologies,</T3>SEARCH Group, Inc., June 1989.)Despite the automation of the search process, further implementation ofAFIS technologies will have little impact in the near future on the estimatedresponse times and costs of processing the additional fingerprint cardsgenerated by the secondary verification procedure. The AFIS matching processis time consuming and both labor and machine intensive.<T3>Advantages. </T3>1. Access to criminal history records would be limitedto law enforcement agencies, except that gun dealers would receive noticeof approval or denial.2. With the exception of the addition of 8.8 million records to the AIS-IIIindex, the system would utilize existing State and Federal criminal historydata bases. The additional inquiry data base and Certificate data basewould be easily established and maintained at a low cost.3. Access through NCIC to the 8.8 million manual records maintained bythe FBI's Identification Division would have added benefit to law enforcement.Currently, checks are limited to younger offenders and those first arrestedafter 1974. Addition of these records would enhance the level of servicethat the FBI could provide to law enforcement agencies nationwide.4. Compared to other options, the initial telephone check would reducethe burden on State and Federal identification systems. Only an estimated10-14% of all purchases would require a fingerprint search.5. No list of applicants or purchasers would be created. Only those individualsissued a Certificate to Purchase or Notice of Denial could be identifiedin a data base. The identity of individuals holding certificates wouldbe regularly expunged from the data set within a year of the date of issuance.6. Purchases of firearms by applicants outside their State of residencewould be permitted. Normal telephone checks and secondary verificationprocedures could be followed.<T3>Disadvantages. </T3>1. The validity of the telephone check is onlyas reliable as the purchaser's identification documents. It does not provideunique identification as do the more expensive fingerprint or other biometricsystems. Consequently, prohibited individuals intent on obtaining a firearmwith false identification documents would be able to pass the telephonecheck.2. A major burden would be placed on the State agency accessing the repositorydata and on local law enforcement agencies that issue the fingerprint cards.The extent of the burden would depend on the volume of requests and degreeof record automation. Further automation of State master name indexes andcriminal history files would be encouraged.3. The system would not be immediate for individuals rejected by the searchof the master name indexes. In addition, some individuals may be falselyidentified because their name and date of birth match those of anotherindividual. Extensive false hits could generate considerable adverse reaction.4. Rejection of prospective buyers as a result of telephone checks maybe perceived by gun dealers as a cause for lost revenue. Buyers who ultimatelyqualify for purchase may not always return to the original dealer and makethe purchase.5. Occasionally the State or NCIC computer systems may not be operatingat the time of purchase, resulting in delays and possibly loss of revenueto the gun dealer.<T3>Potential modifications. </T3>1. The secondary verification procedurecould be modified so that applicants would only be required to appear ata law enforcement agency to be fingerprinted if the State repository wasunable to make a positive determination of eligibility after receivingall automated criminal history records. If the State repository could notdetermine an applicant's identity or resolve questions of eligibility,the applicant would then be fingerprinted at a local law enforcement agency,and the fingerprint cards would be submitted to the State identificationbureau and the FBI for evaluation.This modification could reduce the burden on applicants eligible to purchasefirearms. Applicants with prior arrests but qualified to purchase firearms(e.g., those not convicted of any offense, those convicted only of crimesnot meeting the Federal definition of a felony, or those pardoned) wouldnot automatically be fingerprinted or required to wait the projected 4-6weeks for a complete fingerprint check and evaluation of records.This modification would also reduce the volume of additional fingerprintcards submitted to the State identification bureaus and the FBI.2. A fingerprint could be placed on the BATF application (form 4473). Oncegiven approval for purchase, the gun dealer would roll a print of the applicant'sright index finger, for example. Although this print would not be submittedto the State identification bureau, it could greatly enhance BATF's abilityto prosecute applicants who provide false information. In addition, requiringan applicant to provide a fingerprint on the application form may serveas a deterrent to those who possess fraudulent indentification cards butwho are reluctant to submit fingerprints.3. An applicant data base could be created and maintained by the Stateidentification bureau. This data base would be queried first when a purchasercheck was conducted. It would contain basic information on individual applicantswho had been previously approved through a point-of-sale name check ora secondary verification procedure. The data base would include an applicant'sname, date of birth, race, sex, and a flag indicating approval for purchase.The data base could be updated continuously for subsequent disqualifyingconvictions. Once individuals received approval, no additional searchesof their criminal history files would be conducted for subsequent purchases.This option could eliminate the need for a Certificate to Purchase.If States constructed this data base, the number of name searches and printsearches could be significantly reduced. Fears that such a data base wouldcreate a list of gun purchasers could be allayed by requiring States tosystematically purge records after a 2 or 3 year period. Moreover, sucha data base could be limited to those who failed the telephone check andthen passed the secondary verification; thus, only a small portion of allgun purchasers would be included.4. Point-of-sale approval requirements could be relaxed for certain typesof dealers. Low-volume dealers and those selling at gun shows could beexempted from the telephone checks. However, to regulate purchases of firearmsfrom these dealers, State law enforcement agencies could be required toperform random criminal history checks on those who have purchased firearmsfrom these low-volume dealers.5. Fingerprint searches in the secondary verification process could belimited to the repository within the applicant's State of residence. Federaldata bases would be searched only on name, date of birth, race, and sex.Applicants found to have out-of-State rap sheets would be required to appealto the State repositories maintaining the disqualifying records. This modificationwould have two good effects: (a) a reduction of response time for secondaryverification, and (b) no need to evaluate out-of-State records. However,a major disadvantage is that once a hit is made through NCIC, the burdenof certifying qualification to purchase would be shifted to the applicant.6. To increase reliability, applicants for specific types of guns couldbe required to be fingerprinted and would not be eligible for a telephonecheck.7. To ensure that excess delay in making an eligibility decision did notunduly interfere with the rights of qualified purchasers, the system couldinclude firm deadlines for governmental action at various stages. Failureto meet a deadline would allow the sale to proceed. Ineligible purchaserswould still be subject to subsequent prosecution.<T3>(2) Option A1: Terminal access by gun dealer to disqualifying information.</T3>This option is a variant of Option A, described above, but instead of thegun dealer calling a law enforcement agency, which would access criminalhistory records electronically, the dealer would directly access an intermediarycomputer that would review the indexes and transmit ``accept'' or ``reject''notices to the dealer. The system would work as follows:1. The applicant would present the same identification documents to thedealer as required under Option A.2. The dealer would use a terminal in the shop to access an intermediarycomputer that would review criminal history indexes and transmit authorizationor denial notices to the gun dealer's terminal. (Special passwords wouldbe required to prevent unauthorized access. Transaction logs would be maintainedby the State or NCIC to monitor inquiries.)3. If the notice was to ``accept,'' the sale could be completed immediately.If the notice was to ``reject'' (indicating the existence of a printableoffense), the applicant would be directed to a local police departmentto initiate the secondary verification process.4. Subsequent procedures follow Option A.<T3>Advantages and disadvantages.</T3> All advantages and disadvantagesnoted in Option A apply to this option except as follows:1. The costs for installation of a terminal in each dealership would besubstantial. Training would also be required in the use and maintenanceof the terminals. Procedures for passwords and logs would also be required.2. Access through an intermediary computer would require a new computercapability at the Federal level and in each of the 50 States. Such a capabilitycould be costly.3. There would be no noticeable reduction in response times, since telephonechecks under Option A would also be completed on a real-time basis.<T3>Estimated cost.</T3> See discussion under Option A2.<T3>(3) Option A2: Touch-tone telephone access by gun dealer to disqualifyinginformation.</T3> This option is the same as Option A1 above, but substitutesa touch-tone telephone for terminal access. The system would work as follows:1. The applicant would provide identification to the dealer as requiredunder Option A.2. Using a touch-tone telephone and a toll-free number, the dealer wouldaccess an intermediary computer, as in Option A1, and would enter his licensenumber to prove eligibility. The communications system would establisha log of the transaction. The dealer would then enter the applicant's digitizedname and other identifiers.3. The message would be received by the State repository or NCIC and checkedagainst a master name index.4. The dealer would be advised of the ``accept'' or ``reject'' status only.5. If rejected, the applicant would be advised to seek secondary verificationthrough a local police department. Subsequent procedures would follow OptionA.<T3>Advantages and disadvantages.</T3> The advantages and disadvantageswould also be similar to those for Options A and A1; however, the costsmay be lower than Option A1 since terminals would not have to be installedat all dealers.<T3>Estimated cost.</T3> Although Options A1 and A2 do not present anyparticular operational advantages over the simpler Option A, they wouldbe more complicated and costly to set up. Thus, in the short term theydo not have any benefits over Option A. Nonetheless, it is possible thatby directly and electronically connecting gun dealers to disqualifyinginformation, Options A1 and A2, or others like them, would prove less expensivein the long run than Option A with its need for numerous new personnelin the State repositories to field the calls from gun dealers.<T3>(4) Option A3: Live scan of fingerprints by gun dealer.</T3> This optiondiffers from other variants of Option A in that fingerprints would be takendirectly at the point of sale and digitized for transmission to the recordrepository. Records would be scanned on the basis of fingerprints. Thesystem would work as follows:1. The applicant would place his hands into a fingerprint scanner, whichwould be maintained and operated by the dealer.2. Digitized fingerprint data on all 10 fingers would be transmitted tothe State repository.3. At the State repository, a fingerprint technician would calculate thepattern types of the 10 fingers and then select a subfile of the data basefor a subsequent automated search. Fingerprints would be checked againsta criminal history data base, a fingerprint index, or a specially createddata base of disqualified persons.4. If the search resulted in a list of potential candidates, a fingerprinttechnician would examine the candidate prints and make a determinationof identification.5. Based on the search, an ``accept'' or ``reject'' message would be sentto the gun shop. Fingerprints of accepted applicants would not be retainedby the State identification bureau.6. If a rejection was based on a check against a fingerprint index only,the applicant would be advised to initiate secondary verification. If arejection was based on a full record check or check against a special disqualificationdata base, the denial would be final, but the applicant would be advisedof appeal procedures.<T3>Additional characteristics. </T3>1. Dealers would be required to install10-finger scanning equipment including a capability to transmit the scandata to the State repository and the ability to receive ``accept'' or ``reject''messages from the repository.2. States would need: (a) The capability of receiving the 10-finger scandata, (b) fingerprint technicians to determine pattern types and subfilesto be searched, (c) the ability to search files based on pattern type anddigitized minutiae, (d) the ability to compare applicant prints to candidatefile-prints and determine identification, and (e) the ability to transmitresults to the dealer.3. In order to check for out-of-State arrests, the system would requirethe FBI to set up a mechanism for receiving digitized fingerprint datafrom State repositories, which currently use several incompatible AFISsystems. 4. Response times would include an estimated 6 minutes to scan 10 fingersat the shop, 1-6 minutes for a technician to classify the prints, and 1minute to verify a match from the search file. An additional 5-15 minuteswould likely be required to search the fingerprint file (depending on thesearch procedures, the size of the data base, and the availability of computerequipment). This is an estimated total of 13-28 minutes.<T3>Advantages and disadvantages. </T3>1. Use of fingerprints ensures accuracyof identification at the gun shop. In a properly functioning system, noone who had previously been fingerprinted for a crime would escape detection.2. There would be a substantial reduction in the number of secondary verifications,perhaps as much as 50-80% over Option A.3. A major disadvantage is the extremely high cost of developing, installing,and maintaining on-site equipment and transmission lines. Training fordealers would also be required to obtain properly scanned fingerprints.High-volume dealers would require multiple scanners and additional staff.4. Indexes to Federal and State criminal history files would have to beupgraded and made compatible with fingerprint data transmitted from theon-site scanners. At a minimum, indexes to current criminal history fileswould require upgrading.5. Response times (13-28 minutes) would be longer than the telephone checkof the basic Option A.<T3>Estimated cost. </T3>Because of the novel and complicated nature ofthis option and its use of technologies still under development, it hasbeen possible to estimate only part of the costs of setting up such a system.Consequently, the following estimates should be viewed as only a roughmeasure of system costs. For a system involving live fingerprint scan at all dealers, total start-upcosts are estimated at $9.6-27.1 billion and annual operating costs (assumingequipment depreciation and maintenance) at $3.0-8.3 billion. For a systemrestricting live scan to commercial dealers (an estimated 35% of all dealers),total start-up costs would be an estimated $3.5-9.6 billion and annualoperating costs would be $1.2-3.1 billion.<T3>(5) Option A4: Biometric identification card. </T3>This option is notso much an alternative to the basic Option A as a distinct feature thatcould be added to it. The system requires that the applicant obtain a State-issuedidentification card that incorporates biometric information, name, dateof birth, and other standard identifiers. This card could be a general-purposecard, such as a driver's license, or a special-purpose card for gun purchases.The biometric information could be an actual fingerprint on the card, orit could be a digitized representation of biometric information magneticallyencoded on the card. This option also requires that dealers have equipmentable to read the applicant's fingerprints, or other biometric information,and compare them against characteristics on the card. The system wouldwork as follows:1. The applicant would obtain a card from the State with biometric identifiers.2. The applicant would present the card to the dealer. The dealer wouldthen use equipment to compare the biometric data from the applicant withthe information on the card.3. If there was a match, the dealer would proceed with an inquiry to theState repository either (a) by telephone, as in Option A, or (b) if thecard was in a digitized format, through a device that could communicatewith an external database over telephone lines (as is used in approvingcredit card purchases).4. The remaining procedures follow Option A.<T3>Advantages and disadvantages. </T3>1. The use of biometric informationon the ID card and the subsequent biometric check at the gun shop wouldenhance the reliability of the identification check by making it substantiallymore difficult for such an identification document to be counterfeitedor altered. However, other technologies also exist, such as holograms,to enhance the security of identification documents. Moreover, the biometriccard does not solve the problem of individuals using fraudulent ``breeder''documents, such as birth certificates, to obtain the biometric ID card.2. Prior recording of biometric identification data on the card eliminatesthe need for transmission of biometric data from the dealer to the centralfacility.3. On-site equipment to check biometric data at the point of sale wouldbe expensive to install, maintain, and operate. Dealers would have to betrained.4. Interstate coordination, perhaps requiring the collection and maintenanceof fingerprints for all applicants, would be necessary to prevent applicantsfrom obtaining separate ID cards in different States using different names.This would be important since subsequent inquiries to State or NCIC databases would be based on name rather than fingerprints.5. Biometrically-supported identification could be used to link the dealerwith data bases of other ineligible firearm purchasers, such as those dishonorablydischarged from the Armed Forces.6. Regulations would have to be issued to govern action by dealers if applicantswere discovered to be using false identification (for example, where anapplicant's fingerprints did not match data on the card).<T3>Estimated cost. </T3>The following cost estimates do not include anycosts associated with producing and distributing a biometric identificationcard.For a system involving a biometric check at all dealers, total start-upcosts are estimated at $198-368 million and annual operating costs at $102-168million. For a system restricting the biometric check to commercial dealers(an estimated 35% of all dealers), total start-up costs would be an estimated$93-158 million and annual operating costs would be $70-105 million.<ITAG tagnum="81">II. C. Section 3. Prior approval systems</ITAG><T3>(1) Option B: Firearm Owner's Identification (FOID) Card. </T3>EachState would develop a system for issuing a Firearms Owner's Identification(FOID) Card, which would be required for purchasing any firearm and wouldbe valid for up to 3 years from the date of issue. This system, which wouldbe quite similar to the secondary verification of Option A, would havethe following requirements:<T3>System description (Exhibit 3). </T3>1. Prior to purchase of a firearm,each applicant would be required to appear at a law enforcement agencywithin the jurisdiction of the applicant's legal residence.2. Each applicant would be fingerprinted and photographed, and the fingerprintcards and photograph would be submitted to the State criminal history repositoryand to the FBI's Identification Division for a fingerprint check.3. Results from the FBI fingerprint check would be returned to the designatedState agency for evaluation.4. Additional records could be obtained directly from other State repositoriesor from courts or prosecutors' offices, as described in the discussionof the secondary verification procedures of Option A.5. State officials would evaluate the records from all sources to determinewhether the applicant was eligible to purchase a firearm. The designatedState agency would issue a FOID card or Notice of Denial. The State agencywould maintain a data base on all FOID cards.6. If a Notice of Denial was issued, the applicant would be informed ofthe right to appeal.7. The State agency would periodically issue to all gun dealers a listingof all invalid FOID cards.8. If the applicant possessed a FOID card and wished to purchase a firearm,the gun dealer would be required to verify, prior to sale, the identityof the purchaser and the validity of the card. The applicant would fillout an application for purchase, which would require an additional pieceof identification. The gun dealer would check the listing of invalid FOIDcards.9. If the sale was denied, the gun dealer would instruct the applicanton the procedures for an appeal. The gun dealer would send a copy of theapplication to the appeals agency.<T3>Data sources. </T3>Fingerprint searches would utilize all existingcriminal history data bases at the State and Federal levels. Manual aswell as automated files would be searched. Approval of an application fora FOID card would not require an immediate search for out-of-State records;consequently, the AIS-III index would not have to be modified (as in OptionA). Searches of records on individuals who were arrested before 1974 wouldutilize the current procedures of the FBI's Identification Division.A FOID card data base would be maintained by the State identification bureauor designated State agency. This data base would contain basic informationon applicants who had previously received a card. It would contain theapplicant's name, date of birth, race, sex, other identifying information,and the FOID card number and expiration date. The data base could be regularlyupdated by the State identification bureau for subsequent disqualifyingconvictions. The State agency would issue on a regular basis lists of invalidFOID cards. Unless the applicant elected to renew the FOID card, the database would be purged of all applicant information after the expirationdate.<T3>Verification and controls. </T3>Gun dealers would be required to maintaincopies of all applications and the purchaser's FOID card number. Gun dealerswould be subject to State or Federal audits. Dealers would be subject tocriminal penalties for false records of sale and to loss of license forincomplete records.Access to criminal history records would be restricted to law enforcementagencies.If a card holder became prohibited from purchasing firearms after the FOIDcard had been issued, a Letter of Revocation would be sent by the Stateagency to the individual. The State agency would be required to send allgun dealers a listing of invalid FOID cards. No attempt would be made torecall invalid cards or firearms.<T3>Positive identification. </T3>Positive identification of applicantsby gun dealers could be enhanced by placing the applicant's picture andfingerprint on the FOID card. Requiring the applicant to provide at leastone additional document with a picture identification would provide furtherconfirmation of identity by the gun dealer.Security provisions could be introduced to the FOID card, which would increasethe difficulty and costs of counterfeiting. States could also be encouragedto develop better procedures for issuing breeder documents and securingexisting cards (such as driver's licenses) from counterfeiting.An applicant's fingerprint could also be placed on the BATF application(form 4473, Exhibit 5) at the time of purchase. This requirement wouldnot only enhance BATF's ability to prosecute applicants who provide falseinformation but also serve as a deterrent to individuals with false documentswho may be reluctant to provide a fingerprint.<T3>Out-of-State sales. </T3>The sales of firearms to out-of-State residentseither at a gun shop or through the mail is currently restricted by Federallaw to long guns (e.g., rifles and shotguns). With few exceptions, interstatesales of handguns are prohibited. Under Option B applicants possessinga FOID card issued in one State would be permitted to purchase a long gunin another State; however, applicants could only obtain FOID cards in theirState of residence. Two procedures may be adopted to check qualifications of out-of-State purchasers:(a) Dealers may be required to call a national toll-free number for a nameand date-of-birth check; or (b) out-of-State residents may be requiredto obtain a Certificate to Purchase from a local law enforcement agency.The first procedure would require the non-resident applicant to fill outthe BATF application and present the out-of-State FOID card plus anotherphoto-identification card to the dealer. The dealer would be required tocall a national center, which would conduct a name and date-of-birth searchof State and Federal files through NCIC. The dealer would receive a messageof acceptance or denial. If the sale was denied, the applicant would beadvised of the right to appeal; however, all appeals would be conductedwithin the applicant's State of residence.The second procedure for sales to nonresidents would require that theseapplicants obtain a Certificate to Purchase from a local law enforcementagency within the State of purchase. Prior to purchase of a long gun, theapplicant would submit the out-of-State FOID card and other identificationdocuments to a local law enforcement agency; a name and date-of-birth checkof NCIC files would be conducted; if the applicant had no prior disqualifyingrecord, the applicant would be issued a Certificate to Purchase. The certificatewould be valid for 1 month.<T3>Identifying felons. </T3>The problems of interpreting criminal historyrecords are the same as those discussed in Option A. Accurate interpretationof in-State, out-of-State, and Federal records, though difficult, couldbe achieved given sufficient resources and time.<T3>Response times. </T3>The fingerprint search procedures (including mailhandling) and evaluation of records would require under current practicean estimated 4-6 weeks. (See Option A for details on how response timesare estimated for the equivalent secondary verification procedure.)Some reduction in the average response time could be achieved if Statefingerprint searches produced evidence of disqualifying convictions oryielded an FBI number before the results of the FBI fingerprint check werereceived. In the former case the applicant would be disqualified on thebasis of the State records alone; in the latter case the FBI number couldbe used to do an immediate query of Federal and out-of-State records throughNCIC.<T3>Expected number of cards issued annually. </T3>The proposed FOID cardwould be required of all purchasers of firearms. Unlike the current systemin Illinois (see Part IV, Section 2), FOID cards would not be requiredof current owners or those wishing to buy ammunition. Start-up of the proposedFOID card system would begin with new buyers only.Data on FOID card applications in the State of Illinois provide some basisfor estimating the number of cards to be issued nationwide under OptionB. Nearly 200,000 FOID cards are issued annually in Illinois. Relativeto the resident population age 18 or older in Illinois (8.5 million), thisfigure represents a rate of 2.4 cards per 100 adult residents. If thisrate were applied to all adult residents in the United States, the expectednumber of cards issued annually would exceed 4.2 million in 1990. A FOIDcard valid for only 3 years, instead of 5 years in Illinois, would generatea larger estimate_nearly 6 million cards issued yearly.Because the proposed FOID card system for the Nation is restricted to firearmpurchases only (and excludes requirements for possession of a firearm orpurchase of ammunition), the annual number of cards issued should be somewhatless than the 6 million, based on projections from the Illinois system.However, based on figures from Option A, an estimated 6 million individualsbuy the 7.5 million firearms sold annually. Consequently, in the firstyear of start-up, the estimated number of FOID cards issued cannot be lessthan 6 million. Once the system has been implemented, the number of cardsissued annually should diminish. Though no data exist on the number ofrepeat buyers from year to year, if we estimate that about a sixth of buyersin any one year purchased a firearm in the previous year, then the estimatednumber of cards issued annually should approach 5 million in the long run.Current practices of the District of Columbia and the 22 States that conducta pre- or post-purchase criminal history check would reduce the net impactof Option B by approximately 8%. As a result, the total projected increasein fingerprint cards at the State and Federal levels would be approximately5.5 million in the first year and 4.6 million in subsequent years.The resultant number of fingerprint checks at the FBI would represent morethan a doubling of civil (applicant) fingerprint cards (from the currentfigure of 4 million cards). Overall, the FOID card procedure would increasethe total number of fingerprint cards submitted to the FBI's IdentificationDivision from 8.4 million to 13.0 million_an increase of approximately55%. <T3>Impact. </T3>1. <T3>Purchasers: </T3>Individuals without criminal records would not havethe immediate ability to purchase a firearm. Those without criminal recordswould be required to have fingerprints taken by a law enforcement agencyand be required to wait an estimated 4-6 weeks to obtain a FOID card. Oncea purchaser possessed a card, there would be no additional waiting periodduring the time the card was valid.2. <T3>Dealers: </T3>Little additional burden would be placed on gun dealers.Gun dealers would not be required to place any calls to law enforcementagencies for clearance prior to a sale. Dealers would be required to enterthe FOID card number on each application form and review the lists of invalidFOID cards prior to each sale. Dealers would not perceive a loss of salesas a result of buyers being rejected in the shop at time of sale.3. <T3>State law enforcement: </T3>States would experience a substantial increasein work load. Local law enforcement agencies would process additional paperworkand fingerprint cards. In the long run, the number of fingerprint cardswould increase on average by 55% in each of the State identification bureaus.States would also need to establish an administrative staff to coordinateprocessing of appeals, to conduct system audits, and to coordinate auditsof gun dealers.4. <T3>FBI Identification Division: </T3>The FBI's work load would dramaticallyincrease. Based on the long-term projection of 5 million fingerprint cardssubmitted annually, as many as 1,700 additional employees may be neededby the Identification Division. Approximately 550 of these employees wouldhold technical positions (e.g., fingerprint technicians, classifiers, andverifiers) and 520 would be typists; all of these would require an estimated3-6 months of training. The FBI would need several years to recruit andclear these 1,700 new employees, assuming this is even possible. Moreover,it would require an additional 31,000 square feet of office space.<T3>Costs. </T3>The annual operating cost at the State and local levelis estimated to be between $71 million and $91 million. (For detailed costestimates, see Exhibit 6 and Estimates of Start-up and Operational Costsof Systems for Identifying Felons Who Attempt to Purchase Firearms, Fisher-OrsaghAssociates, June 1989.) State and local law enforcement agencies wouldalso require an estimated $72 million for start-up costs.At the Federal level the estimated cost for processing the anticipated5 million fingerprint cards a year is $65-70 million, and the cost forstart-up is $77-81 million.Overall, when local, State, and Federal costs are combined, the estimatedannual operating cost for Option B is $136-161 million, and the estimatedstart-up cost is $148-153 million.If the annual operating costs were transferred to applicants through userfees, a fee of $27.28-32.39 per FOID card application would be requiredto cover local, State, and Federal costs.Note that if current fingerprint checks for gun purchasers are taken intoaccount, the actual new costs may be slightly lower than these estimates_perhaps5% lower for start-up costs and 8% lower for annual operating costs.<T3>Advantages. </T3>1. The system would utilize existing data sources,communications systems, and search procedures.2. Access to criminal history records would be limited to law enforcementagencies. Gun dealers would receive only a listing of invalid card numbers.3. Positive identification for those with a criminal history record couldbe established at the time of application for the FOID card. Unlike OptionA, an estimated 6-8% of the individual applicants would not be falselyrejected because they had a name and date of birth similar to that of someonewith a criminal history record.4. Use of the FOID card would make purchase of firearms more convenientby eliminating point-of-sale criminal history checks. Only one criminalhistory check would be required in a 3-year period regardless of the numberof firearms purchased. 5. This system would be much less burdensome to the gun dealer than thepoint-of-sale options.<T3>Disadvantages. </T3>1. Individuals without criminal records would nothave the immediate ability to purchase a firearm and would be requiredto have fingerprints taken by a law enforcement agency. The processingof applications for FOID cards could take approximately 4-6 weeks. Theremay also be public resistance to systematic fingerprinting of all firearmpurchasers.2. Fingerprint searches are slow and costly and place heavy demands onState and Federal repositories, which are having difficulties with currentwork loads. 3. A State FOID card system would create a list of all persons with validcards. Though essential to verification and prevention of forgery and fraud,the creation of such a list may be controversial.<T3>Potential modifications. </T3>1. Fingerprint searches may be limitedto the repository within the applicant's State of residence. Federal databases would be searched only on name, date of birth, race, and sex. Inorder to accomplish this, the AIS-III index would have to be expanded toinclude individuals arrested before 1974. State repositories would assembleFederal and out-of-State records from automated and manual FBI files plusadditional records obtained from NCIC. This modification would substantiallyreduce the FBI's burden in conducting fingerprint checks while increasingits burden in providing manual records in response to NCIC inquiries. Thenet effect could be a reduction in burden to the FBI. This modificationin Option B would also potentially reduce response times and system costs.A major disadvantage would be decreased reliability in searches of Federaland out-of-State records since name searches of automated records are lessreliable than fingerprint-based searches.2. A notarized statement of eligibility from an applicant could be substitutedfor fingerprint checks (similar to procedures in Illinois). Fingerprintchecks would not be performed. Verification and control procedures couldbe introduced through random criminal history checks conducted by Stateidentification bureaus. Criminal sanctions could be imposed on individualswho falsify information on the application form. State repositories andFederal officials would be given authority to conduct audits, to revokeFOID cards, and to impose criminal sanctions on fraudulent applicants.Major advantages of this modification would include: (a) The burdens onState and Federal repositories would be reduced; (b) the burden on applicantswould be limited to obtaining a notarized statement; and (c) response timefrom application to issuance of card could be reduced from the 4-6 weeksin Option B. The major disadvantage would be an increased potential forfraud by disqualified applicants.3. Fingerprints could be required only for the initial issuance of theFOID card. Renewals could be based on a name and date-of-birth search only.As a result of this modification, the annual number of fingerprint searchescould be reduced by about a third.4. The FBI Identification Division could build a ``stop file.'' Applicantprint cards could be added to the existing criminal files or to a specialFOID card file. State identification bureaus could then be notified bythe FBI when a FOID card holder was subsequently convicted of a disqualifyingoffense. As a result of this modification, FOID cards would not have tobe restricted to a 3-year term; consequently, the number of fingerprintcards sent to the State and the FBI would be reduced. Major disadvantagesof this procedure would include: (a) A substantial increase in the numberof non-criminal fingerprint cards retained by the FBI, and (b) increasedfears that such a data base would create a Federal list of gun owners andthat it could be used for other criminal justice or investigative purposes.5. The proposed system could be modified so that FOID cards would be requiredonly of purchasers of specific types of guns. <T3>(2) Option B1: Live scan of fingerprints by local law enforcement andbiometric check by gun dealer. </T3>This option is a variant of the pre-approvalsystem described in Option B. In this variation gun buyers would be fingerprintedby local law enforcement; State and Federal criminal history files wouldbe checked by the local law enforcement agency; individuals would be notifiedof the results while at the law enforcement agency; if approved, individualswould be issued a FOID card; if rejected, individuals would be advisedof appeal procedures. The system would work as follows:1. The applicant would go to a designated law enforcement agency to obtaina FOID card.2. The applicant would place all 10 fingers into a fingerprint scanner,which would be maintained and operated by the local law enforcement agency.3. Digitized fingerprint data would be transmitted to the State identificationbureau (and to the FBI if the applicant was not disqualified by the State).4. At the State identification bureau, a fingerprint technician would calculatethe pattern type, which would identify the subfile of the State fingerprintdata base. The subfile would then be searched for potential matches.5. If the search resulted in a list of potential matches, a fingerprinttechnician would examine the prints and determine identity.6. If a match was found, a technician at the State identification bureauwould inspect the criminal record for disqualifying convictions. If theapplicant was disqualified, the local law enforcement agency would be immediatelynotified and the applicant would receive a Notice of Denial.7. If a match was not found in the State files (or if the applicant hadno disqualifying convictions), the digitized fingerprints, pattern types,and other identifying information would be transmitted by the State identificationbureau to the FBI. The FBI would subsequently conduct an electronic searchof the national fingerprint files, master name index, and criminal historyfiles.8. If a match was found in the FBI files, the State identification bureauwould receive (by NLETS) copies of the automated records and (by mail)copies of the manual records. If automated, the State would evaluate therecords and transmit results to local law enforcement. If manual, the Statewould notify the law enforcement agency that a record was found and thatthe applicant could return within 7 work days to receive a FOID card orNotice of Denial.9. If an applicant was issued a FOID card, the State identification bureauwould retain a copy of the applicant's fingerprints. A print of eitherthe thumb or index finger would be on the FOID card.10. At the gun shop, purchasers would present the card to the dealer. Thedealer would then use equipment to scan the applicant's fingerprint (oneprint). The equipment would compare the applicant's print to the printon the FOID card. 11. The dealer would call the State identification bureau. The FOID carddata base would be examined to determine whether the person in the gunshop was the same person who applied for the card, whether the card hadbeen reported lost or stolen, or had expired, or whether the person hadbeen subsequently convicted of a felony.12. The dealer would receive notice of approval or denial of sale fromthe State identification bureau. As a result of a denial, applicants wouldbe advised of appeal procedures.<T3>Advantages and disadvantages. </T3>1. <T3>Advantages include:</T3> (a) Shorter response time to obtain a permit_amajority of applicants could, within an hour, receive a valid FOID cardfrom local law enforcement; (b) the ability to increase the reliabilityof identification at the gun shop; (c) the ability to identify FOID cardsas lost, stolen, lapsed, or disqualified; and (d) the enhancement of automatedfingerprint processing for all law enforcement purposes.2. <T3>Disadvantages include: </T3>(a) The high costs of start-up and operations;(b) the requirement for equipment and software that are currently beingtested or yet to be developed; (c) the need for modifying existing Stateand Federal data bases to interface with digitized fingerprint information;(d) additional automation of State indexes and criminal history files;(e) public resistance to a data base that identified all FOID card holders;(f) significant increased burden on local law enforcement agencies; and(g) the need for additional fingerprint technicians and record evaluatorsat State identification bureaus.<T3>Estimated costs. </T3>Because of the novel and complicated nature ofthis option and its use of technologies still under development, it hasbeen possible to estimate only part of the costs of setting up such a system.Consequently, the following estimates should be viewed as only a roughmeasure of system costs.For a system involving a biometric check at all dealers, total start-upcosts are estimated at $344-572 million and annual operating costs at $203-295million. For a system restricting the biometric check to commercial dealers(an estimated 35% of all dealers), total start-up costs could be an estimated$239-362 million and annual operating costs would be $171-232 million.<T3>(3) Option B2: Smart card containing disqualifying information. </T3>Inthis variation of a pre-approval system, everyone would carry a card (e.g.,a driver's license) that would have electronically imprinted identificationinformation, including biometric data such as fingerprints. Whenever someonebecame legally disqualified to purchase a firearm (for example, by beingconvicted of a felony), the card would be updated to contain this information.Anyone attempting to buy a firearm would have to produce the card. Thecard would be put into a reader that would indicate whether the carrierwas prohibited from purchasing firearms.<T3>Advantages and disadvantages.</T3> 1. The major advantage is that thisprocedure would not require a communications system_the disqualifying informationwould be on the card itself.2. A major disadvantage is the cost of implementing such a radically newidentification system and providing criminal justice agencies with thefacilities to update these cards.3. There may be substantial public resistance to the requirement to carrysuch a card, especially since the need for interstate coordination mayrequire the creation of biometric databases for the Nation's adult population.<T3>Estimated costs.</T3> Sufficient information does not currently existto make reliable cost estimates of this novel and far-reaching option.<T3>II. D. Section 4. Appeal procedures.</T3> The appeals process commencesat the point that the applicant receives final notice that the sale hasbeen denied and has been notified of the reasons for denial. This may occurafter ``secondary verification'' (Option A) or after denial of a firearmowner's identification (FOID) card (Option B). As described in both options,fingerprint checks against State and Federal data bases would have beencompleted prior to final denial and initiation of the appeal period.During the appeal, the applicant may challenge the denial on grounds thatthe data are inaccurate (e.g., an acquittal was recorded as a conviction);that the record is incomplete (e.g., a subsequent pardon was not recordedin the data base); or that the offense does not represent a disqualifyingoffense under the Federal or State standards. Challenges based on inaccurateidentification would not occur at the appeals stage since fingerprint checksprior to denial would, presumably, catch errors of this type. The appealsprocess would proceed as follows:1. Following final denial, the applicant is advised of rights to appealand given a document to initiate the appeal.2. The applicant would go to the agency designated to handle appeals (orwould submit documents to a non-local appeals agency).3. The applicant would be provided a copy of the criminal history recordthat was used as the basis for disqualification.4. The applicant would indicate the basis for the appeal. The appeals agencywould assist the applicant either directly or indirectly by providing names,addresses, or telephone numbers for inquiries to in-State or out-of-Stateagencies.5. If errors could not be corrected on the spot or by telephone, the applicantwould obtain and submit to the appeals agency documents supporting eligibility(for example, court records of acquittal, pardon, or restoration of rights).6. The appeals agency would then review the documentation and rule on theappeal. If eligibility was established, the individual would receive aFOID card or Certificate to Purchase.7. If eligibility was denied, the applicant would be advised of rightsto a court challenge.<T3>Additional considerations.</T3> 1. The agency (or agencies) assignedresponsibility for appeals must be determined. The agency could be thedecision agency (State or Federal), a local agency, or a separate entity(State or Federal). Although the latter option would provide an independentreview, the decision agency would probably be more familiar with the criminalhistory records. Local agencies would best serve as a conduit to the officialappeals agency rather than as the agency responsible to rule on the appeal.2. The degree of formality for the appeal must be determined. For example,a separate ``Board'' could be established, or alternatively, an existingunit within an agency could be designated.3. Procedures for applicant assistance must be developed. In particular,procedures regarding challenges based on out-of-State records should bedeveloped and coordinated on a national basis.4. The time for the appeal and decisions may have to be limited.5. Some States may consider their existing procedures for correcting orupdating criminal history records as adequate for a felon identificationsystem.III. Legal and Policy IssuesBased upon legal research of State and Federal case law conducted for theTask Force, there appear to be no constitutional impediments to the creationof felon identification systems as described in this report. (See Legaland Policy Issues Relating to Biometric Identification Technologies, SEARCHGroup, Inc., June 1989.) Criminal history checks, including those basedon fingerprints, are currently required by State and Federal law for avariety of non-criminal justice purposes such as job applications and securityclearances. Depending on the jurisdiction, such checks are conducted forthose desiring to be lawyers, child care workers, State or Federal employees,bartenders, etc. The courts have generally upheld these requirements asrationally related to legitimate governmental purposes. Nonetheless, theuse of felon identification systems in firearm sales does raise a varietyof important policy issues that may have to be addressed in Federal andState legislation. Some of the major issues are outlined here.A final selection of any particular identification system ought to be precededby a rigorous legal review by appropriate divisions within the U.S. Departmentof Justice.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. A Federal or State System; Mandatory or Voluntary?</ITAG>There are four broad possibilities for implementing a felon identificationsystem: (1) To create a self-standing Federal system that is run entirelyby Federal officials; (2) to mandate a cooperative Federal-State systemin which State officials carry out a substantial portion of the criminalhistory checks; (3) to establish a mandatory Federal standard that Statescould meet in a variety of different ways; and (4) to offer the Statesseveral models for a voluntary cooperative Federal-State system and makeFederal resources and leadership available to assist the States.(1) The Task Force did not focus its research efforts on the creation ofan independent Federal system for the simple reason that 90% or more ofarrests and convictions in the United States are handled by State and localofficials. Because of the variety of State laws, practices, and data systems,only State officials are in a position to properly interpret criminal historyrecord information for their State and to determine whether a convictionmeets the Federal standard for disallowing a firearm purchase. Moreover,State officials are in the best position to track down missing or incompleteinformation with local courts or prosecutors. Thus, the active involvementof State officials in the criminal history checks would seem essentialfor an effective felon identification system.(2) Given the necessity for active State involvement, the Federal governmentcould create a felon identification system by mandating that the Statesadopt a particular system, such as one of those detailed here or a modificationthereof. Under this implementation strategy, the Federal government wouldselect a felon identification system and each State would be required towork with Federal officials to implement it. The result would be a uniformsystem in each of the 50 States. Such a mandate could be enforced by makingState cooperation a condition for the receipt of specified Federal fundsor, more directly, for the sale of firearms within the State (under theFederal authority over interstate commerce).(3) Another possible implementation plan is to allow variation across theStates in the kind of system established as long as each State's systemmet certain minimum Federal standards. As noted above, 20 States and theDistrict of Columbia currently conduct a pre-purchase criminal historycheck for those who wish to buy handguns. There is, however, substantialvariation among these systems. In some States checks are conducted by localauthorities; in others by State authorities. Some States access only Staterecords when conducting the check; others also access Federal records.A few States require fingerprints; most do not. Of these existing systems,some might be as effective as the options detailed in this report in keepingconvicted felons from purchasing firearms through legitimate retail outlets.Others might be easily upgraded.All of the options presented in this report meet at least two minimum standards:all firearm purchases from federally licensed dealers are covered; anda name check of both State and Federal automated data bases is conductedfor evidence of an arrest for a serious crime (such checks usually alsoinclude date of birth, race, and sex). It appears that only four Statesand the District of Columbia currently meet both standards.(4) Finally, the Federal government could take a leadership role in designingone or more felon identification systems and in encouraging, but not mandating,State cooperation. Under this strategy the Federal government would expandits own resources at the FBI and BATF to make such a system(s) possibleand would provide expertise and technical assistance to State and localofficials.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Sources of Funding for Criminal History Checks</ITAG>The Federal government will be required to invest substantial resourcesin national data bases, including both personnel and equipment, in orderto handle the increase in workload that would result from a felon identificationsystem for firearm sales. State repositories also will require substantialadditional resources to handle the work load increase and to continue toimprove data quality. Given these resource needs, policymakers will haveto determine the appropriate funding mechanism for carrying out the requiredcriminal history checks. Such funding mechanisms could include one or moreof the following: (1) direct appropriations by the Federal and State governments,(2) user fees by gun purchasers, and (3) increases in firearm dealers'licensing fees through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Inaddition, legislation would have to address whether the State and Federalgovernments would share any revenue generated by a felon identificationsystem and in what proportion.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Release of criminal history information to gun dealers</ITAG>The Task Force has not proposed any options that would give gun dealersdirect access to criminal history record information. Such access wouldviolate established standards of privacy and confidentiality as well asnumerous State statutes that preclude access to criminal history recordsby non-law enforcement personnel. Nonetheless, several of the options dorequire notification to the dealer that a criminal history check has turnedup evidence of an arrest for a felony or serious misdemeanor. Even thislimited provision of information may violate some State statutes or regulations.Under Option A and its variants, for example, the dealer would learn whetherthere was evidence that the prospective purchaser had a criminal historyrecord, but the dealer would not learn the substance of the record itself.This may be viewed by some as a release of criminal history informationto non-law enforcement personnel in a way that would embarrass or stigmatizethe prospective purchaser. Indeed, in many (perhaps most) cases an initialindication of a criminal record would eventually be shown to be untruebecause it resulted from a misidentification with someone else with a commonname and date of birth. Yet a ``hit'' on the initial telephone check willbe known to personnel at the gun store and perhaps to customers or otherswho are present. As a result, the purchaser's reputation within his communitymay be harmed through no fault of his own. This issue indicates the needfor legislative prohibitions on the release by gun dealers and others ofanything learned during the telephone check of purchasers, although itmay be difficult to enforce such prohibitions against customers or otherswho may overhear or observe the results of a ``hit'' during the telephonecheck.An important privacy consideration is whether gun dealers in a point-of-salesystem would keep the records or lists of those who failed the initialcheck. Operationally, as in the options described in this report, suchrecordkeeping is not necessary and could be prohibited by law.Note that under Option B and its variants the prospective purchaser hasalready completed a full-fledged criminal history check before going tothe gun dealer. Thus, the gun dealer only sees those who have previouslyqualified to purchase a firearm. He does not learn about those who failedthe pre-approval procedure. Only in the few cases where the purchaser hadbeen arrested between issuance of the FOID card and his attempt to purchasea firearm would any disqualifying information become known to the gun dealer.Another issue of relevance to gun dealers is whether or to what extenttheir liability ought to be limited by law for providing firearms to disqualifiedpersons on the basis of inaccurate information they received from law enforcementauthorities.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. The issue of accuracy</ITAG>The Congressional mandate under Section 6213 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Actcalls for the ``accurate identification of felons'' who attempt to purchasefirearms. The statute, however, does not specify the level of accuracythat would be acceptable. Since, for the reasons elaborated earlier inthis report, a perfectly accurate system is not feasible in the foreseeablefuture, policymakers will have to decide how much accuracy is requiredfor an effective felon identification system. Generally speaking, the mostaccurate systems are those that are the most expensive and that createthe greatest inconvenience for the gun purchaser.The issue of accuracy has two sides: (1) to correctly identify felons whoattempt to purchase firearms and (2) not to reject eligible persons whoattempt to purchase firearms. Deficiencies in identification documentsfor positively establishing identity, incomplete criminal history records,and the prevalence of common names and dates of birth complicate thesetwo tasks and make it that much more difficult to achieve both simultaneously.A system, for example, that focused primarily on not rejecting eligiblepersons might prove incapable of correctly identifying a large number offelons. On the other hand, a system that single-mindedly sought to keepconvicted felons from purchasing firearms might catch in its nets numerouslaw-abiding individuals who have a right to purchase firearms. How thebalance is to be struck between these two goals_to correctly identify felonsand not to reject eligible persons_is a policy, not a technical, judgment.The options outlined in this report present a variety of schemes for meetingthe two sides of the accuracy mandate.Because criminal history records are subject to error, the dictate foran accurate system points to the need for mechanisms through which prospectivegun purchasers can update and correct criminal history information. Fortunately,such procedures currently exist in all the States. Any felon identificationsystem for firearm sales ought to have a linkage to these procedures sothat corrections to criminal history records can be made in a timely fashion.Otherwise, persons eligible to purchase firearms may be improperly prohibitedfrom doing so.The requirements for establishing an accurate felon identification systemhighlight the need for complete and up-to-date criminal history records,preferably in an automated format. Improvements in the accuracy of criminalhistory records would generate benefits in a wide range of criminal justiceapplications.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Creating a data base of firearm purchasers</ITAG>None of the options outlined in this report provide for or require thecreation of a national data base of firearm purchasers. Since all the optionsare essentially State run, any recordkeeping, whether manual or automated,regarding the application to purchase, or the actual purchase of, firearmswould be maintained at the State level, as is currently the case in theStates that now require a written application and criminal history checkfor firearm purchases.Operationally, the maintenance of computer inquiry logs_transaction recordsthat do not necessarily require the applicant's name_is necessary to measuresystem traffic and cost and to ensure that inquiries are made only by legitimatedealers for legitimate purposes. In addition, any pre-approval system (suchas Option B and its variants and the secondary verification of Option A)must maintain records of successful applicants if the system is to havethe capability of revoking permits (or FOID cards) if a holder is convictedof a disqualifying felony. This could apply under systems that requirethe return of a revoked permit and under those in which dealers check thevalidity of a permit prior to sale.The development of a data base of gun purchase applicants raises the possibilitythat such records might be used for other purposes. For example, individualsincluded in such a data base might be treated as possible suspects in crimesinvolving firearms. If fingerprint data were included in the file, latentfingerprints might be routinely run against the data base.Policymakers, of course, could prohibit such use of applicant records throughlaw. Moreover, strict limits could be placed on the time during which recordsof firearm applicants were maintained and on the extent to which applicantnames would appear on transaction logs. In point-of-sale systems, timelimits could be placed on the retention of initial inquiry records whichdo not result in a ``hit.''Pre-approval systems, however, have greaterrecordkeeping requirements if the possibility of revoking permits is tobe maintained.<ITAG tagnum="81">F. Potential ``Tracking'' of Firearm Purchasers</ITAG>Any system that requires a criminal history record check prior to purchaseof a firearm creates the potential for the automated tracking of individualswho seek to purchase firearms. It would be possible, for example, for authoritiesto ``flag'' the names of specific individuals, perhaps suspects in criminalcases, who might seek approval to purchase a firearm. If an automated criminalhistory check was conducted on such a flagged individual as part of anapplication to purchase a firearm, an electronic message to this effectcould be sent to the interested law enforcement agency without the knowledgeof the applicant. In this way authorities could learn about the potentialpurchase of a firearm by someone under investigation or surveillance aswell as the geographic location of the purchaser.Policymakers will have to decide whether to prohibit all such trackingactivity or to permit it in some circumstances (for example, notifyingthe Secret Service when a person suspected of being a threat to the Presidentpurchases a firearm). If some tracking is to be permitted, then clear rulesand conditions for such activity will have to be established.<ITAG tagnum="81">G. Issuing Documents Authorizing Firearm Purchases</ITAG>The pre-approval options outlined here (Option B and its variants) requirethe issuance of some kind of documentation (FOID card, certificate to purchase,permit, etc.) for the prospective gun purchaser to present to the gun dealercertifying that the purchaser is not a convicted felon. Moreover, the point-of-saleoptions (Option A and its variants) have a similar requirement for thosewho fail on the original telephone check.Such a requirement, especially if mandated by Federal law, raises policyissues regarding whether the firearm purchaser ought to be singled outand forced to prove through documentation that he is not a convicted felonbefore he can engage in an otherwise lawful commercial activity. In additionto the inconvenience that such a requirement creates, it may be viewedas demeaning by some.The other policy issue that such a requirement for documentation presentsis that this may be interpretated as an initial step toward a nationalidentification card, something that members of Congress and others havestrongly opposed in the past. It should be noted, however, that there areseveral important differences between a national ID card system and thekinds of documentation required in the options in this report. As usuallyconceived, a national ID card would be an identification document thatwas issued to all adult Americans and which had to be carried at all times;yet neither of these conditions would apply to the kind of documentationdiscussed in this report. FOID cards or firearm purchase permits wouldbe required only for those who wish to purchase firearms and would haveto be carried only at the time of purchase. Legislation could prohibitthe use of such cards for unrelated identification purposes.<ITAG tagnum="81">H. The Use of Biometric Data</ITAG>Many of the options detailed in this report require the collection of biometricdata in the form of fingerprints at some stage in the approval process.Given the traditional association of fingerprints with law enforcement,there may be public resistance to the requirement to provide fingerprintsat a law enforcement agency or at a gun dealership in order to purchasea firearm. Such concern may be heightened if the fingerprints are kepton file, manually or electronically, and are subsequently used for unrelatedinvestigative purposes, criminal or otherwise. As noted earlier, such useof the fingerprints provided in a felon identification system could beprohibited by law. Other biometric technologies, such as retinal scans, could be introducedinto felon identification systems, especially to verify identity againsta biometrically based identification card. Because some of these technologiesmight be perceived as physically more intrusive than fingerprints, publicopposition to their use may be greater than to the use of fingerprints.On the other hand, this may be counterbalanced by the fact that these newertechnologies are not as closely associated with law enforcement activitiesas fingerprints.IV.

B. Section 2. Current Practices<ITAG tagnum="81">(1) Federal Control of Firearms</ITAG>The Federal role in the control of firearms is derived primarily from theGun Control Act of 1968 as amended and is overseen at the National levelby the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) of the Departmentof the Treasury. BATF has over 40 field offices and 500 field agents usedfor the control of firearms, alcohol, and tobacco; over half of the agentsare devoted to firearms control. There are approximately 270,000 federallylicensed firearm dealers. It is estimated that 60-70% are noncommercialdealers (hobbyists, collectors, etc.) and account for 20-25% of all salesof firearms. Primary control is maintained through the licensing of dealersand the recording of sales.Prospective dealers apply for a license through BATF. Ordinary dealerspay a fee of $10 a year; pawnbrokers pay $25 a year; and gun dealers whosell ``destructive devices'' may be required to pay a fee of up to $1,000a year. Licenses are issued for 3 years after inquiry and investigationhas determined that the applicant is legally qualified. Disqualificationcan be made if the applicant is under 21 years of age, has previously violatedthe laws and regulations governing firearms, or is ineligible to possessa firearm under Federal law. This license may be renewed, but may not betransferred if the business is sold. There are a variety of regulationsthat affect licensees; and licenses may be suspended or revoked for cause.Retail firearm sales require the completion of BATF form 4473 (Exhibit5) for each over-the-counter sale or transfer to an end user. This formrequires the prospective owner's name, address, date and place of birth,height, weight, and race. It also requires a certification that the prospectivebuyer is not prohibited from owning a firearm because of a prior felonyconviction or because he is in one of the several other categories of personswho are precluded from ownership by Federal law_including, among others,those dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, habitual drug users,and those who have been committed to a mental institution. The type andserial numbers of any weapons purchased are also recorded. The dealer isrequired to see appropriate identification from the prospective owner,such as a State driver's license, and must make a note of the method ofidentification on the BATF form 4473. There are stiff criminal penaltiesfor false statements on the form_up to 5 years in prison.Records relating to firearm transactions must be retained on the premisesof the dealer for a period of 20 years. If the dealership is sold, therecords be must transferred upon issuance of a new license. If the dealergoes out of business without a successor, the records of transactions mustbe shipped to BATF's long-term storage facility in Landover, Md. BATF agentsmay enter gun dealers' facilities and inspect any or all of the recordsthat are required to be maintained by Federal law. These examinations areconstrained by the law, which spells out in some detail the conditions(frequency and purpose) under which such investigations may be made. Asan example, in the event of a crime involving a firearm, BATF secures adescription of the weapon, including the serial number, and traces it fromthe manufacturer or importer through the distributor to the retail dealerwhere the records of sale are examined in an effort to trace the weaponto the owner of record.Because of limitations in manpower, BATF agents concentrate their examinationof records on high-volume retail stores, dealers who are suspected of illegalgun sales, and other individuals who come to the attention of the agentsthrough other sources. In their examination of these records, the agentsare especially alert to the sale of two or more handguns to the same purchaserwithin 3 days. Other causes for suspicion include sales to suspected gangmembers or sales of high-powered weapons to suspected ``straw purchasers,''those buying guns for others who are ineligible. If an inspection is notsatisfactory, BATF (1) may note the problem and reinspect in about 3 months,(2) notify the dealer that his license is in jeopardy if corrective actionsare not taken, (3) take other administrative action, or (4) initiate criminalproceedings.<ITAG tagnum="81">(2) State Practices Regarding Firearm Sales</ITAG>Currently, 20 States and the District of Columbia, covering 55% of theNation's population, conduct a criminal history check of persons desiringto purchase a handgun prior to allowing that person to take possessionof the weapon (Exhibit 7). Four of these States and D.C. include the purchaseof long guns in this requirement. In 10 States and D.C. the burden of responsibilityfor pre-purchase criminal history checks falls solely on local law enforcementagencies (either the police or sheriffs' department); in 5 States thisresponsibility is solely that of a State agency; and in another 5 Statesagencies at both State and local levels conduct criminal history checksprior to purchase.The levels of criminal history information accessed in these checks varyamong the States. Eight States access files no higher than those maintainedat the State level; 12 States and D.C. access national criminal historyrecords.In most States this criminal history check is done using name, date ofbirth, and other identifying characteristics such as race and sex, butexcluding fingerprints. In six States and D.C. fingerprints are taken fromthe applicant for use in the criminal history check. In one of these Statesonly a thumbprint is obtained.The criminal history check is conducted as part of an application processinvolving a mandatory waiting period. In 15 States this application processand waiting period are required for each handgun purchase (a permit isobtained through this process in four of these States). In six States asuccessful application for purchase of handguns results in a permit oridentification card which allows purchases for a specified or indefinitetime period. In the four States and D.C. that require criminal historychecks for the purchase of long guns, a successful application resultsin an identification card, permit, or registration certificate.In some instances, a criminal history check is conducted after the purchaserof a handgun has taken possession of the weapon. In Pennsylvania, a post-purchasecheck is conducted by the State agency (in addition to a pre-purchase checkconducted locally). Two States (Michigan and South Carolina) conduct acriminal history check on handgun purchasers only after the buyer has takenpossession of the weapon. In Michigan this check is done by the local agency,and in South Carolina it is done by the State agency.State residents making their initial purchase of a handgun in the 20 Statesand D.C. conducting a pre-purchase criminal history check are subject towaiting periods ranging from 2 days to 6 months (Exhibit 8). The two Statesthat conduct only a post-purchase criminal history check on handgun purchasershave no waiting period. One State (Wisconsin) requires a 2-day waitingperiod for handguns, but does not conduct a criminal history check on thepurchasers of handguns. The waiting periods for the purchase of long gunsin the four States and D.C. that require a criminal history check for suchpurchases range from 15 to 60 days. Local jurisdictions in many Statesmay have additional restrictions or requirements for the purchase of handgunsand long guns.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Application Requirements for Firearm Purchases in the 10 Largest States(as of April 1989; Population Figures are for 1988)</ITAG><T3>California (pop. 28,074,000). </T3>A written application is requiredto purchase a handgun.

The Act provides for the issuance of Firearms Owner's Identification(FOID) cards to persons authorized to acquire or possess firearms or ammunition.The provisions of the Act are administered by the Illinois State Police.An applicant submits a notarized card application form (with photo) tothe Illinois State Police. The applicant must indicate whether he:(1) Has previously been convicted of a felony;(2) Has been a patient in a mental institution within the preceding 5 years;(3) Is addicted to narcotics; or(4) Is mentally retarded.Rejection of the application may occur for affirmative responses to anyof the above or for perjured responses.Upon receipt of an application, a criminal history check is conducted utilizinga name index search through both the Illinois and Federal criminal historyrecords systems. An additional check is conducted with the Illinois Departmentof Mental Health and Disabilities. After determination that the applicantis not an ineligible person, a FOID card is issued with a 5-year expirationdate.Applicants who are rejected may appeal to the Chief of the IdentificationBureau of the Illinois State Police for an administrative hearing for reconsiderationand must, by personal appearance, present relevant documentation to supporta reconsideration. Subsequent appeals must be made through the State Court.If State authorities learn that a FOID cardholder has become ineligible(for example, by a felony conviction), the card is revoked and a voluntaryreturn of the card is requested. The revocation is noted in the State criminalhistory files. If the card is not returned voluntarily, it may be retrievedby the local police.Illinois authorities report that approximately 200,000 FOID cards are issuedannually. An estimated 78% of all cards are issued with the first application;the final rejection rate is about 5%.The Illinois State Police have noted three problem areas for administrationof the program:1. the identification procedures used do not insure a positive identification;2. court notification of disposition of felony charges for inclusion incriminal history records has not been accurate or timely; and,3. private mental health institutions are not required to share informationfor the record check.<ITAG tagnum="81">Virginia's New Point-of-Sale Approval System</ITAG>The following is a summary of procedures being established to implementthe recently enacted Virginia statute requiring felony checks for personswanting to purchase firearms within the State. The legislation was enactedby both houses of the Virginia legislature in February l989 and was signedby the Governor in April 1989. The system is to be implemented by November1, 1989. All information was obtained from the Virginia Department of StatePolice.One of the unresolved issues is which gun dealers are covered by the Act.The implementing agency, the Department of Public Safety, would preferthat small local dealers be exempted from coverage. They indicate thatin comparison to large dealers who may sell 1,400-2,000 weapons coveredunder the bill each month, small dealers may sell no more than one or twoeach year.The statute applies to:1. Handguns with a barrel of less than 5 inches, and 2. Semi-automatic center fire rifles or pistols that expel projectilesby action of an explosion, have a magazine that holds more than 20 roundsof ammunition, and are designed by the manufacturer to accommodate silencers,bayonets, tripods, flash suppressors, or folding stock.<ITAG tagnum="81">Procedures for Implementation</ITAG>1. The purchaser presents two pieces of ID to the dealer.2. The dealer calls the State Police using a toll-free telephone number.(The system will operate 7 days a week from 8 AM to l0 PM. The RecordsManagement Division estimates that they will receive 250,000 inquiriesa year).3. The dealer identifies himself by giving his firearm dealer ID numberand the control number from the State firearm purchaser's application form.4. The State checks the validity of the ID number and confirms that thecontrol number has been assigned to that dealer. (This is designed to preventinvalid inquiries. A micro-computer system is being developed that willcontain dealer identification information and list the control numbersassigned to each dealer.)5. The dealer provides the State Police with the applicant's name, sex,race, date of birth, and social security number.6. While the dealer remains on the phone, the State Police make a namecheck against the State index to criminal history records and the ``wantedpersons'' list. An exact name, sex, race, and date-of-birth match willbe required to make a ``hit.'' It is estimated that 16-20% of the telephoneinquiries will result in a ``hit.'' The total time for a phone call isexpected to be about 3 minutes.7. If there is a hit against the State index, the dealer is advised thatthe sale cannot be completed. State Police then have until the dealer'snext close of business day to determine if the applicant was actually convictedof a disqualifying felony. During this time, checks will be made againstthe State criminal history records, the NCIC ``wanted persons'' records,and the Interstate Identification Index (III). If no record is found withinthis time, the dealer is advised that the sale may proceed. If a disqualifyingfelony is found, the dealer is advised that the sale may not proceed. Thedealer then forwards a copy of the State application form to the StatePolice to permit cross checking of the control number and an appeal bythe applicant.8. If the sale is approved, the application form (with the dealer's controlnumber) is completed and forwarded to the State Police. A check is thenmade to verify the data.9. If there is no ``hit'' against the State index in the initial inquiry,the dealer is advised that the sale may proceed immediately. The Stateapplication form containing the control number is then forwarded to theState Police. The form will have been signed by the applicant attestingto the absence of any disqualifying felonies. Upon receipt of the applicationform, a check is initiated against State and Federal criminal history records.If a disqualifying felony record is found, this information and a copyof the application form is forwarded to the dealer and to the chief lawenforcement official in the jurisdiction in which the sale was made. Itis anticipated that the law enforcement official will issue an arrest warrantand initiate efforts to retrieve the firearm.10. Appeals are based on the applicant's general right to inspect and correcthis record. In general, applicants will be directed to the local policedepartment who may take fingerprints to support the record check. (TheState does not require a fingerprint check.) The applicant would also beadvised of any out-of-State records and would be assisted in contactingout-of-State officials.11. The system described above applies to Virginia residents only. Out-of-Stateresidents, who may legally purchase long guns but not handguns, must applyfor a permit. This application process, during which a criminal historycheck is conducted, may take up to 10 days.<ITAG tagnum="81">Maintenance of Records</ITAG>If the applicant is approved, a log of the inquiry transaction (includingthe applicant's name) will be maintained in an active file for 30 days.Thereafter, the information will be kept in an inactive file for auditpurposes.If the applicant is disapproved, a record of the inquiry and the basisfor the denial will be retained for 60 days (the length of time duringwhich the applicant may appeal the denial). If the applicant does not appeal,the record of the denial will be transferred to an inactive file and maintainedfor audit purposes.If an appeal is successful, the record will be maintained in accordancewith the procedures established for approved applicants (as described above).If an appeal is denied, a copy of the application form, marked ``appealdenied,'' will be forwarded to the dealer. No reason will be given forthe denial to prevent the dissemination of criminal history to the dealer.A record of the appeal denial will be maintained in an inactive statusfor audit purposes.<ITAG tagnum="81">Estimated Cost</ITAG>Virginia officials estimate that this system will require 16 new full-timepersonnel and will cost $481,000 for 12 months operation ($90,000 for start-upcosts and $391,000 for annual operating costs). This will cover staff,space, forms, communications, and equipment.<ITAG tagnum="81">Differences Between the Virginia System and Option A</ITAG>1. The Virginia system applies only to specific categories of firearmsand may be further limited to selected categories of dealers.2. In the Virginia system Federal and interstate records are not checkedprior to sale unless there is a ``hit'' against the State index. UnderOption A, a check is automatically made against State and Federal records.3. Virginia checks are based on name only and do not require a personalappearance at a law enforcement agency until the final appeal. Under OptionA, the secondary verification on which a disapproval is based is supportedby a fingerprint check.4. The Virginia system has strict deadlines for government action, whichare not included in the basic Option A.IV. C. Section 3: Access to Federal criminal history recordsThrough both its Identification Division and the National Crime InformationCenter (NCIC), the FBI serves as a central access point for Federal andState criminal history record information. The Identification Divisionmaintains fingerprint-based criminal history records on approximately 25million individuals who have been arrested at some time in their livesfor a serious offense (felony or serious misdemeanor). These records aredescribed below. In addition, the FBI operates the Interstate IdentificationIndex (III), accessed through the NCIC telecommunications network, whichnotifies law enforcement agencies requesting criminal history informationwhether a record exists in one of the 20 States (listed below) that currentlyparticipate in III. The III is a cooperative Federal-State program forthe interstate exchange of criminal history record information that makesavailable in a timely manner criminal history information to the law enforcementcommunity.III participating States maintain their own computerized criminal history(CCH) files at the State level and provide information from these fileswhen a request comes either through the NCIC network or directly to theState through the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS).Most States that do not participate in III also maintain automated CCHsystems, but these are not directly tied into the NCIC system. These data,if automated, can be accessed by a direct request through NLETS. In addition,when a request comes in to the FBI through NCIC, it provides whatever automateddata it has in its Identification Division from non-participating States.In order to provide rapid access to these State and Federal criminal historyfiles, the FBI maintains an automated master name index (MNI) of over 12.5million records, with over 70,000 new records being added each month. Anindex record contains an individual's name, aliases, physical description,identifying numbers, fingerprint classification, and the location(s) ofthe criminal history record(s).Criminal history records, sometimes call ``rap sheets,'' are cumulative,name-indexed histories of an individual's involvement in the criminal justicesystem for serious offenses (felonies and serious misdemeanors). Excludedare records on arrests and subsequent dispositions for such offenses asdrunkenness, vagrancy, disturbing the peace, and traffic violations (exceptmanslaughter, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and hit-and-run).Offenses committed by juvenile offenders are excluded unless a juvenileis tried as an adult.Access to these Federal data bases and indexes is through the NCIC system.The NCIC computer equipment is located at FBI headquarters in Washington,D.C. Connecting terminals are located throughout the United States, Canada,Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands in police departments, sheriffs'offices, State police facilities, Federal law enforcement agencies, andother criminal justice agencies. The system includes 37,000 terminals in17,000 locations and provides uninterrupted service 24 hours a day, 7 daysa week. Over 130 dedicated telecommunications lines link Federal and Stateagencies together. Each State maintains a central Control Terminal Agency(CTA), which is directly connected to NCIC. Telecommunications lines andequipment within the State provide State and local criminal justice agenciesaccess to the control terminal.The NCIC system provides direct, electronic access to the Interstate IdentificationIndex of records maintained in the 20 participating States and to the IdentificationDivision's automated records. This combined index is now known as the AutomatedInformation System_Phase III (AIS-III). Moreover, NCIC maintains severalnational ``hot files.'' These hot files contain identifying informationconcerning wanted and missing persons, stolen vehicles, and identifiablestolen property of several types.In addition to the computerized AIS-III MNI, the Identification Divisionmaintains three criminal history files designed for use by Federal andState agencies:1. An automated criminal history file which contains rap sheet informationon 12.5 million persons arrested for the first time and reported to theFBI since July 1, 1974, or known to the FBI with a year of birth 1956 orlater.2. Manual criminal history records on approximately 8.8 million individualsborn in or after 1929 but arrested at some time before July 1, 1974. Thereis an automated master name index to these data, but it is available onlyfor in-house use and not through the NCIC network. The manual rap sheetjackets are maintained at various locations in the Washington, D.C., area.Several of the options detailed above require merging the index for theserecords into the AIS-III index.3. Manual criminal history records on about 3.6 million offenders bornbefore 1929 whose files are maintained by the Identification Division.There is no automated index to this older information.In general, indexes at the Federal level are arrest-based files containingonly identifying information on individuals arrested for ``fingerprintable''offenses. See Exhibit 4 for an overview of these indexes and data bases.An authorized criminal justice agency can make an inquiry (a QH message)on name, sex, race, date of birth, and numeric identifiers such as SocialSecurity Number, State Identification Number (SID), or FBI number. Mostinitial searches are on name, sex, race, and date of birth, if known. Inresponse to a QH inquiry, the requester will be provided one of the followingresponses:1. A single matching record response_a ``hit.''2. A multiple matching response, up to a maximum of 15 records_a ``hit.''3. A ``no record'' response_a ``no hit.''A ``no hit'' response does not necessarily mean that there is no criminalhistory record on the individual being investigated. The FBI IdentificationDivision maintains fingerprints on approximately 25 million persons (21million automated). Of these, about half, 12.5 million, are contained inthe AIS-III MNI, discussed above. In order to access the information inthe additional records maintained by the FBI, a law enforcement agencycan submit a fingerprint card, usually through the mail, to the IdentificationDivision for a more detailed search. Additionally, there may be criminalhistory information at the local or State level for which the arrest fingerprintcard was never forwarded to the FBI.As indicated above, a positive response to an NCIC inquiry (called a QHresponse) can result in either a single record response (one individual)or a multiple record response (up to 15 individuals). The response providesthe requester with three types of information:1. The person's name, including aliases, physical descriptors, and numericalidentifiers.2. The identity of the data base(s) containing the criminal history recordinformation.3. The means to be used to obtain the record(s).In order to retrieve a specific criminal history, a criminal history recordrequest (QR message) containing the person's FBI or SID number must beused. The identifiers are obtained from the name-based QH inquiry or fromother sources such as State CCH records or investigative files. The QRmessage will result in an automatic notification to all data bases identifiedas having information on the subject being investigated. The CCH systemsof the States participating in III will be queried and the individual'srap sheet from one or more III States will automatically be forwarded viaNLETS. FBI records on Federal offenders and non-participating III Stateswill be sent on-line using NCIC telecommunications.If the automated name index for the records of the 8.8 million personsborn in or after 1929 and arrested before July 1, 1974, is integrated intothe AIS-III index, then under the initial verification procedure proposedin Option A (telephone check by the gun dealer), an NCIC inquiry couldbe conducted within a matter of minutes on approximately 21.3 million individualswho have been arrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor.The 20 States participating in III as of June 1989:<ITAG tagnum="42">California</ITAG><P>Colorado</P><P>Connecticut</P><P>Delaware</P><P>Florida</P><P>Georgia</P><P>Idaho</P><P>Michigan</P><P>Minnesota</P><P>Missouri</P><P>New Jersey</P><P>New York</P><P>North Carolina </P><P>Ohio</P><P>Oregon </P><P>Pennsylvania </P><P>South Carolina</P><P>Texas </P><P>Virginia </P><P>Wyoming</P>IV. D. Section 4. Study of Other Persons Ineligible to PurchaseFirearms Section 6213(c) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 requires the AttorneyGeneral to conduct a feasibility study to determine whether an effectivemethod can be established for identifying ``other persons'' ineligibleto purchase firearms (that is, other than convicted felons). Such personsinclude fugitives from justice, those who use or are addicted to illegaldrugs, those who have been adjudicated as mentally defective or have beencommitted to a mental institution, illegal aliens, those dishonorably dischargedfrom the Armed Forces, and those who have renounced their American citizenship.This study must be submitted to Congress by May 18, 1990.On behalf of the Task Force the Bureau of Justice Statistics has solicitedproposals from outside contractors with the expertise necessary to conductsuch a study. The study, scheduled to begin on July 1, 1989, will includethe following elements:andbullet; The availability of existing data bases that can be utilized toidentify ineligible individuals;andbullet; The quality of these data bases in terms of completeness and accuracyof records;andbullet; The remote accessibility of the data bases through a telecommunicationssystem, particularly, the method and cost of access;andbullet; Legal restrictions on the use of the data and an analysis of therelevant privacy and confidentiality considerations of accessing such data;andandbullet; The feasibility of linking these data bases with a felon identificationsystem.V.
