RUBIN</BYLINE><UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Saturday hehas told regulators with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ``in nouncertain terms'' that they lack authority to promise immunity fromprosecution to savings and loan officials.   ``Henceforth it's not to be indulged in,'' Thornburgh said. Theattorney general said he believed there were only ``isolatedinstances'' in which bank board regulators offered immunity fromprosecution to those under investigation for fraud in the savingsand loan industry.   Thornburgh, in an impromptu news conference following a luncheonspeech at the American Bar Association convention here, declined tobe drawn into a possible controversy over gun control.   ABA President Robert Raven said Friday he asked Thornburgh tosupport a federal waiting period for would-be gun buyers.   Raven, citing the recent slaying of five children at a Stockton,Calif., school and the wounding of four others in Washington, D.C.,said there is a ``glaring loophole'' in federal law that allowspeople to buy automatic weapons and assault rifles.   Thornburgh refused to say if he supports Raven's waiting periodproposal or if such weapons are too easily purchased.   ``We want to look at it,'' the attorney general said.   The savings and loan questions were prompted by a reports thatfederal prosecutors are being hamstrung by promises of immunity madeby Home Loan Bank Board regulators.   A U.S. attorney in Los Angeles said top officials of the failedSan Marino Savings andamp; Loan Corp. were told they could avoidprosecution by helping regulators recover some of the money lostwhen the thrift institution collapsed in 1984.   Thornburgh said the offer was a misunderstanding made withoutconsultation with the Justice Department and that bank boardregulators have been warned not to do it again.   Thornburgh also met with the ABA group that assesses judicialappointees and said he thinks it will continue to play a role inevaluating Bush administration nominees to the federal bench.   In his remarks to the ABA luncheon, Thornburgh said the Bushadministration will be a tough fighter against street crime.   ``Firm and effective action against drug-related criminalactivities, including application of the newly enacted federal deathpenalty, will be necessary to end the free-fire zones that havetaken the lives of so many innocent people,'' he said.   Thornburgh also said he supports a pay raise of about 50 percentfor federal judges that is due to take effect unless both houses ofCongress vote to block it before Wednesday.   ``It's absolutely essential that the pay-raise bill takeeffect,'' he said.   Thornburgh also said he will press for higher pay for U.S.attorneys and FBI agents.</TEXT></DOC>
