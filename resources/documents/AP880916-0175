About one-eighth ofMozambique's 11.7 million people are Catholic.   The bishops have been urging Chissano's government to startnegotiations with anti-Marxist rebels of the Mozambique NationalResistance, known by their Portuguese acronym, Renamo. Thegovernment has refused to negotiate and has criticized the bishopsfor advocating talk with ``armed bandits.''   ``The weapons we are still obliged to carry are used exclusivelyto defend our country's freedom and our nation,'' Chissano told thepope at the Ponte Vermelha (Red Point) palace, built by thePortuguese colonialists before Mozambique became independent in1975.   ``Your holiness proclaims the path of peace and denounces thepaths of hatred, the trade of war, the murder of innocents and theinadmissable methods of terrorism,'' Chissano said.   The 11-year-old civil war in this southeast African country hasforced about 1 million Mozambicans to flee into neighboringcountries. Nearly half Mozambique's 14.5 million people are in needof food aid, according to relief organizations.   Mozambique is the final stop on the pope's 10-day tour ofsouthern Africa. In addition to Swaziland, he also has visitedZimbabwe, Botswana and Lesotho and made a brief unscheduled stop inSouth Africa on Wednesday after his plane was diverted in badweather.   The Renamo guerrillas, believed to number between 12,000 and22,000, roam the countryside almost at will and have causedtremendous econonic damage.   No government acknowledges assisting the rebels, who have beenaccused of widespread civilian atrocities. Renamo denies thecharges.   The U.S. State Department, in a report released in April,estimated the rebels killed 100,000 civilians in the past two tothree years.   Renamo this week announced a cease-fire during the pope's visitand wished the pontiff a good stay. Still, Mozambique announcedextensive security measures for the pope and the pilgrims travelingto see him at stops in Nampula, Beira and Maputo, the capital.   Mozambique receives most of its military assistance from theSoviet Union but increasingly has been making overtures to Westernnations. The United States is the largest donor of food aid inMozambique, and Britain has been providing military training.   Mozambique also has been working to improve relations withneighboring South Africa, which has backed Renamo in the past.South Africa says it stopped supporting the guerrillas under termsof a 1984 mutual non-aggression pact, but Mozambique has continuedto accuse South Africa of providing assistance.   Mozambique regularly refers to South Africa as the ``racistregime,'' but on Monday Chissano hosted South African PresidentP.W. Botha on his first summit meeting in a black-ruled Africannation.   The Vatican has tried to prod the peace process in Mozambique bysending one of John Paul's top cardinal aides to meet separatelywith Botha and Chissano in July. Also, some Mozambican bishopsreportedly have maintained contacts with Renamo.   Chissano met the pope in May in Rome, but the Vactican appearsto be holding off the establishment of diplomatic relations as anincentive to move the peace process ahead.   In Mbabane, Swaziland, earlier Friday, the pope preached aboutthe virtues of monogamy at a Mass attended by Swaziland's20-year-old king and his four wives.   King Mswati III, the world's youngest monarch, satexpressionless as the pope told a crowd of 10,000 at the capital'snational stadium that God intended each husband to have one wife.   The pope, who arrived at the stadium in his popemobile escortedby spear-carrying warriors, spoke from an altar topped by a turretmanned by a soldier with a rifle and binoculars.</TEXT></DOC>
