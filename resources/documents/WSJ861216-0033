GTE Corp., which moves 1,200 people a year, says the price of homes near its Stamford, Conn., headquarters is a big factor. When people move, &quot;they want to be made whole,&quot; says Thomas Green, vice president for development. Fluor Corp. says workers in its Southern offices have refused transfers to its Irvine, Calif., base and to New York because of housing costs.    Capital Cities/ABC Inc. offers transferees a bid on their current homes through a relocation service. Declining interest rates have eased the problem a bit, officials say. About half of the 225 people First Chicago Corp. transfers annually get some housing assistance. Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. provides a three-year income supplement to most of the workers it transfers.    Refusing to move doesn't end a career, but &quot;a mobile person still has an advantage,&quot; says GTE's Mr. Green.    FLEXIBLE BENEFIT PLANS become more popular.    A survey of 824 companies in seven metropolitan areas shows that 24% offer their employees the cafeteria-style plans that permit choices among various health, vacation and other options, says A.S. Hansen Inc., benefits consultant. Thirty-seven percent of the employers say they use the programs to meet workers' needs; 31% say they adopted flexible systems to control benefit costs.    The plans require more explanation. &quot;You have to give employees good information to make good decisions. Company paternalism isn't the answer in the '80s,&quot; says Hansen senior consultant Thomas Maloof. Better computer software has made the plans simpler to administer, he says.    STATES AIM to help lower-income people get and keep jobs.    Next month, the Washington legislature will consider a &quot;family independence program&quot; that offers job training, health benefits and 135% of a recipient's welfare benefits while he or she is in the program. California started Greater Avenues for Independence last summer, combining job training, child-care services and &quot;workfare.&quot; The program is mandatory for most welfare recipients until they're off the rolls.    Ohio's legislature recently approved tax benefits for day-care expenses if a family's income is under $30,000. It also increased by 47% state contributions to a state-federal day-care fund. In October, North Carolina said some farmers can enter its dislocated-worker program, which offers job-placement assistance and training.    But some states can't offer help. &quot;There just hasn't been the money to do that,&quot; says South Carolina Gov. Richard Riley.    BRIEFING BUST: A Texas state judge ruled that 25 University Park police officers must be paid overtime for having attended 25-minute daily briefings since 1980. Officials of the Dallas suburb expect the ruling to cost $250,000 and require worker layoffs. The officers' lawyers warn that furloughing officers would return the case to court.    MOST STATES don't require screening of private-guard job applicants for mental or drug problems, says a survey by Guardsmark Inc., a New York security-services company. About 75% of the states forgo such checks, and most have no training standards. Because of liability concerns, far fewer guards are being armed, the survey notes.    FEAR OF LAWSUITS contributed to large 1986 increases in directors' fees, says Wyatt Co., a benefits consulting firm. Its survey shows median increases were 25% for fees and 20% for retainers; 10% more companies gave board members liability insurance. The dollar value of the coverage rose by 30% to 50% in some cases.    PAY-FOR-KNOWLEDGE compensation systems, which tie wages to the type of skills workers learn, are used in 8% of major corporations, says a Labor Department study. Although mostly found in nonunionized manufacturing businesses, the system works in other settings, the study shows. Workers who run out of new skills to master can still add to income through bonuses.    BALTIMORE PENSION FUND resists divesting stock with ties to South Africa.    Trustees of the $1.2 billion city workers' fund say Baltimore's stand on divestment will affect $450 million of its assets, 39% of its total portfolio. Divestment will hurt more because the system pegs benefit increases solely to the fund's performance instead of to inflation, says Administrator Ernest Glinka. He says the law is more severe than those that only limit new investments; it also requires sale of certain stocks within two years, beginning next Jan. 1.    Although most pension boards have complied with divestment edicts elsewhere, experts say challenges are expected because the laws can conflict with responsibilities to the funds' beneficiaries. An Oregon court ruled that a fund's voluntary divestment was imprudent because the trustees didn't consider other options, such as partial sales.    Baltimore says its fund can file a test case in Circuit Court, although it means one city agency will be suing another.    THE CHECKOFF: University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School says the average starting salary reported by its female MBA graduates in 1986 topped those reported by male graduates by 1.3%. . . Employee benefits in 1985 cost companies $8,166 per worker, or about $3.95 an hour, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. </TEXT></DOC>
