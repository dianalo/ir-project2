The second rule is Rule 15a-3 under the Act, which exempts frombroker-dealer registration exchange specialists executing block trades.The third rule is Rule 15b7-1 under the Act, which provides that the Commissionnot name a securities salesperson as a party to an administrative proceedingwithout first obtaining the salesperson's consent. The fourt rule is Rule15A<T3>1</T3>2-1 under the Act, a cross-reference rule which provides forthe application procedures outlined in Rule 15b7-1 to administrative proceedingsconcerning the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer from membershipin a registered national securities association. The fifth rule is Rule15c2-3, which prohibits broker-dealers from trading in certain German securities.The sixth rule is Rule 19a3-1, a cross-reference rule to Rule 15b7-1. Theseventh rule is Rule 19b-3, which prohibits national securities exchangesfrom promulgating rules which fix commissions. These rules have becomeunnecessary due to action by the courts, Congress, and the passage of time.Consistent with investor protection, the Commission is rescinding the rulesas part of its ongoing effort to update regulation and eliminate obsoleterules. Finally, the Commission is making a conforming amendment to Rule12a-5 of the Act to reflect the rescission of Rule 7c2-1.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>effective date:</T2> October 20, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact:</T2> Adrian Colachis, Esq., 202/272-2415,Division of Market Regulation, Room 5023, Securities and Exchange Commission,450 5th Street NW, Washington, DC 20549.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information:</T2> Rule 7c2-1 under the Act is being rescinded.At the time Rule 7c2-1 was adopted,\1\<NOTE/> and during subsequent amendments,\2\<NOTE/> section 7(c)(2) prohibited a broker-dealer from extendingcredit to a customer without collateral, or on any collateral other thanexempted securities or securities registered upon a national securitiesexchange. The rule originally was intended to provide a temporary exemptionfrom the provisions of section 7(c)(2) of the Act so that securities tradedon national securities exchanges that were exempt from registration undersection 5 of the Act could be used as collateral to the same extent asthose traded on registered exchanges. The rule was later modified to providea similar exemption for securities that were either listed on nationalsecurities exchanges or had unlisted trading privileges, but were not subjectto the registration requirements in section 12(a) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 11 (September 28, 1934).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 432 (December 1935);808 (September 28, 1936); and 1887 (September 10, 1938). In 1968, section 7(c)(2) was amended, eliminating the requirement thatsecurities be exempted securities or registered on a national securitiesexchange in order to be used as collateral by broker-dealers in credittransactions.\3\<NOTE/> As a result of the 1968 Amendments, the Commission has determinedthat Rule 7c2-1 has become obsolete. Accordingly, the Commission is rescindingthe rule. At the same time, the Commission is also amending Rule 12a-5of the Act to reflect the rescission of Rule 7c2-1. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Pub. L. No. 90-437, 82 Stat. 452 (1968). The Commission is rescinding Rule 15a-3 under the Act. This rule, adoptedin 1958 \4\<NOTE/> and never amended, exempts exchange specialists executingblock trades off the floor of the exchange from the broker-dealer registrationrequirements of section 15(a) of the Act. At that time, exchange specialiststrading exclusively on an exchange were not required by section 15(a) toregister as broker-dealers; Rule 15a-3 extended this broker-dealer registrationexemption to block trades executed off the exchange. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 5790 (October 10,1958), 23 FR 8097. The Securities Act Amendments of 1975 (``1975 Amendments''), amending section15(a), required all exchange specialists to register as broker-dealers.\5\<NOTE/> Because exchange specialists now are registered as broker-dealers,Rule 15a-3's exemption from broker-dealer registration is no longer necessary.Therefore, the Commission is rescinding Rule 15a-3. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See</T3> S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 109 (1975). Rule 15b7-1, ``Proceedings under section 15(b), 15A(<T3>l</T3>)(2) and 19(a)(3) of the Act,'' Rule 15A<T3>l</T3>2-1, ``Proceedings Under section 15A(<T3>l</T3>)(2) of the Act'' and Rule 19a3-1, ``Proceedings under section19(a)(3) of the Act,'' were adopted \6\<NOTE/> to codify the procedures implemented by the Commission followingthe decision of the U.S. court of appeals in <T3>Wallach</T3> v. <T3>SEC.</T3> \7\<NOTE/> In <T3>Wallach</T3>, the court held that the Commission could not name a securitiessalesperson as a party to an administrative proceeding against a broker-dealerunder section 15(b) of the Act without the salesperson's consent. Rule15b7-1 \8\<NOTE/> established the procedures to be followed by the Commissionin such cases, and delineated the Commission's statutory authority pursuantto sections 15(b), 15A(<T3>l</T3>)(2), 19(a)(3) and 15A(b)(4) regarding administrative proceedings.Rule 15A<T3>l</T3>2-1 was adopted as a cross-reference rule to Rule 15b7-1 andwas intended to apply to administrative proceedings where a broker-dealerwas suspended or expelled from membership in a national securities associationunder section 15A(<T3>l</T3>)(2). Rule 19a3-1 also was adopted as a cross-reference ruleto Rule 15b7-1, and was intended to apply to proceedings under section19(a)(3), which were governed by the provisions of Rule 15b7-1. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 5225 (September 9,1955), 20 FR 7036. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ 202 F.2d 462 (D.C. Cir. 1955). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Rule 15b7-1 originally was designated Rule X-15B-9. Rule15A<T3>l</T3>2-1 originally was designated Rule X-15a<T3>l</T3>2-1. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 7700 (September 10,1965), 30 FR 11851. Congress amended the Act in 1964 (``1964 Amendments''). Section 15A(<T3>l</T3>) was amended at that time to enable the Commission to bar, censureor suspend (for a period not exceeding 12 months) a person from being associatedwith a member of a registered securities association on the same groundsthat a member of the association could have been suspended or expelledby the Commission. The 1964 Amendments also limited the application ofthe <T3>Wallach</T3> case. Accordingly, the Commission amended Rule 15b7-1to limit its application to proceedings commenced before the enactmentof the 1964 Amendments. No further proceedings have been instituted underRule 15b7-1. Rule 15b7-1 has been rendered obsolete by its reference tosection 15A(<T3>l</T3>)(2), which was repealed by the 1975 Amendments.\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Public Law No. 94-29, 89 Stat. 97 (1975). The companion Rules, 15A<T3>l</T3>2-1 and 19a3-1 were not rescinded at that time. Proceedings areno longer conducted pursuant to section 15A(<T3>l</T3>)(2). Proceedings under Rule 19a3-1 are governed by the obsoleteprovisions of Rule 15b7-1. Accordingly, the Commission has decided to rescind Rules 15b7-1, 15A<T3>l</T3>2-1, and 19a3-1 because it finds that the rules are no longernecessary.\1\\0\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3> is not applicable because the proposed actions are notsubject to public notice and comment. In addition, the Commission has decided to rescind Rule 19b-3 of the Act,Rule 19b-3 prohibits any national securities exchange from adopting orretaining any rule that requires its members or any of their associatedpersons to charge a fixed commission for transactions effected on or byuse of the facilities of the exchange. The Commission has determined thatthe activities proscribed by Rule 19b-3 are prohibited to the same extentby section 6 of the Act. Accordingly, the Commission is rescinding Rule19b-3 as unnecessary. The Commission also is rescinding Rule 15c2-3. Rule 15c2-3 was adoptedin 1954 in response to concerns that certain German bearer bonds, lootedby the Soviet Army at the conclusion of World War II, might be sold orpurchased through broker-dealers.\1\\1\<NOTE/> Under the provisions of a Treaty between the Federal Republicof Germany and the United States, no German dollar bonds subject to thevalidation laws of the Federal Republic of Germany are enforceable againstthe issuer unless they have been validated. The rule prohibits broker-dealersfrom inducing the purchase or sale of these securities unless they havebeen validated under any applicable validation law of the Federal Republicof Germany. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 4983 (January 11, 1954),5011 (March 9, 1954), and 5370 (September 24, 1956). Since the rule was adopted in 1954, the Validation Board for German DollarBonds established in this country to review requests for validation hasceased operating. Moreover, most, if not all of the bonds have long sincematured. Although the bonds occasionally may be traded or produced forredemption, the Commission has concluded that the market for these instrumentshas diminished substantially since the rule was adopted. Accordingly, theCommission no longer believes that Rule 15c2-3 is necessary to guard againstthe sale of unvalidated German dollar bonds by broker-dealers. Any broker-dealersthat induce the sale or purchase of these instruments in the future, however,are reminded that they continue to be subject to the general antifraudprovisions of the federal securities laws.\12\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ <T3>See, e.g., In the Matter of Merill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andamp; Smith,Inc., et al.,</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 14149 (November9, 1977) (stating that ``[w]hen a broker-dealer recommends a security toits customer it represents that it has conducted a reasonable investigationof that security and that there exists a reasonable basis for the recommendation.'')In accordance with section 4(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act,5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), the Commission finds that notice and opportunity forpublic comment are unnecessary because the rules being rescinded are obsolete.Consequently, the rescission of the rules and the conforming amendmentto Rule 12a-5, will not impair the protection of investors. Pursuant tosection 4(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(9), theCommission may make the rescission and the conforming amendment effectiveimmediately because the rescission affects unnecessary rules.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 17 CFR Part 240</ITAG>Brokers, confidential business information, Fraud, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Securities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statutory Authority</ITAG>Pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and particularly sections7(c), 12(a), 15(a), 15(b), 15(c), 15A, 19(a), 19(b) and 23 thereof, 15U.S.C. 78<T3>1</T3>, 78<T3>o</T3>(a), 78<T3>o</T3>(b), 78<T3>o</T3>(c), 78<T3>o</T3>-3, 78s, and 78w, the Commission is amending Chapter II of Title17 by removing andSection; 240.7c2-1, andSection; 340.15a-3, andSection; 240.15b7.1,andSection; 240.15c2-3, andSection; 240.15A<T3>1</T3>2-1, andSection; 240.19a3-1 and andSection; 240.19b-3; and amendingandSection; 240.12a-5 in the manner set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Text of Final Amendments</ITAG>In accordance with the foregoing, 17 CFR Part 240 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 240_GENERAL RULES AND REGULATIONS, SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF1934</ITAG>1.
