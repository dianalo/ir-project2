Airbus arranged the loan after Northwest -- a unit of NWAInc., St. Paul, Minn. -- agreed to order an additional 75A-320 aircraft manufactured by Airbus and take options on 30more Airbus planes. A GE joint venture is supplying theengines for those aircraft.</LP><TEXT>   Although Northwest is Airbus's largest U.S. customer, theEuropean company had faced stiff competition for theNorthwest order, valued at $4.6 billion, from Seattleaircraft maker, Boeing Co. The cash arrangement may havegiven Airbus an edge in the competition.   Officials familiar with the transaction say Northwestplans to use the loan to reduce the bank debt that resultedfrom its acquisition last year by an investor group thatincluded Alfred A. Checchi and several other former MarriottCorp. executives. The Checchi group borrowed about $3 billionto purchase the airline and has $1.7 billion in bank debtremaining.   The new aircraft -- narrow-body twin-engine jets that seat150 passengers -- will be paid for through the airline'soperating funds as they are delivered, persons familiar withthe transaction said.   The loan reduces the chance that Northwest will face acash crunch as it weathers a period of sharply higher fuelprices and soft domestic passenger traffic. The carrierestimates its fuel bill this year could increase by $180million.   The cash infusion also gives Northwest a cushion as itfaces other potential financial hurdles. The carrier isfacing a Sept. 29 deadline from the Department ofTransportation to find a replacement for $225 million of a$400 million equity investment from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.Northwest is also under pressure to buy back an $80 millionstake currently held by Elders IXL Ltd., an Australianconcern.   Elders has been trying to sell the Northwest stake andother assets to solve its own debt problems. Northwest coulduse a portion of the Airbus-arranged loan to complete thepurchase of the Elders stake.   The KLM situation is less pressing since thetransportation department is likely to grant Northwest anextension for reducing the KLM investment to $175 million.That would be the second extension the carrier has received.The department ordered Northwest to alter the KLM investmentlast year, citing rules about foreign control over U.S.carriers.   Northwest and GE declined to discuss the Airbustransaction. However, Alan Boyd, chairman of Airbus Industrieof North America, confirmed Airbus arranged the loan withNorthwest during negotiations over the aircraft order.   Mr. Boyd declined to say how much of the loan Airbusprovided and how much came from GE. Mr. Boyd said the newA-320s and spare parts Northwest ordered will serve ascollateral for the loan, which is repayable after 1995. Theloan is believed to carry an interest rate of less than 10%.   GE's involvement in the transaction is through CFMInternational, a joint venture GE has with the Frenchaircraft engine concern, SNECMA. The GE engine order isvalued at $1.3 billion.   The Airbus loan to Northwest could renew the debate amongU.S. aircraft manufacturers over whether their European rivalis using unfair inducements to gain a toehold in the U.S. TheU.S. aircraft market is dominated by Boeing and St.Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp.   Mr. Boyd of Airbus said Boeing set a precedent for suchtransactions when Boeing agreed in 1987 to invest $700million in Chicago-based UAL Corp. to help United Airlines'parent thwart a takeover attempt by its pilot union.   &quot;Airbus is operating in a purely commercial fashion. We'venot done a single thing where there was not already aprecedent,&quot; Mr. Boyd said.   Spokesmen for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas both declinedto comment on the Airbus-Northwest arrangement.   It could be difficult for the U.S. manufacturers to openlycriticize Airbus's move since the loan is a boon toNorthwest. The loan could help the carrier reduce itsacquisition debt to a point where it could refinance theborrowing at a much lower interest rate. The Checchi groupcurrently pays an interest rate of about 10% on the debt.   Refinancing the debt at a lower rate would give Northwesta stronger balance sheet at a time when even the strongestcarriers are predicting lower earnings.   Northwest earned its first profit since the Checchiacquisition during this year's second quarter, when it hadnet income of $59.6 million on revenue of $1.8 billion.Higher fuel costs are expected to clobber earnings atNorthwest and most other airlines in the third quarter.   ---   Randall Smith in New York contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
