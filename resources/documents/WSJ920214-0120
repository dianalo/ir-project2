Asset-allocation funds, they say, are a low-risk way toimprove your investment returns. The funds are designed torelieve investors of the need to figure out for themselveshow much money to put into stocks, bonds and money-marketinstruments. The fund manager does the work for you,adjusting the mix from time to time in an effort to profitfrom changing market conditions.</LP><TEXT>   Many investors like the idea. The 77 asset-allocationfunds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. have $8.3billion, up from $5.4 billion a year ago.   But a number of financial professionals say many of thesefunds don't deliver the results investors may hope for.&quot;They're a high-tech product that hasn't delivered ahigh-tech performance,&quot; says John Rekenthaler, editor ofMorningstar Mutual Funds, a publication that tracks fundresults. In general, he says, &quot;they haven't been goodinvestments.&quot;   Asset-allocation funds' total returns have trailed notonly those of the average stock fund in recent years, butalso those of their closest mutual fund relative -- theold-fashioned &quot;balanced&quot; fund, many of which keep a fairlystable 60%-40% mix of stocks and bonds.   According to Lipper Analytical Services, the averageasset-allocation fund that shifts money among mostly U.S.investments returned a cumulative 44.6% over the past threeyears. And the newest product, asset-allocation funds thatshift funds around the world, did even worse, returning atotal of 30%.   In comparison, the average balanced fund returned 51%, andthe average stock fund returned 59.4% over the past threeyears, Lipper's numbers show.   The problem is that asset-allocation funds &quot;are structuredon the shaky assumption that they can forecast the marketcorrectly&quot; and can shift funds to take advantage of thatforecast, says John Markese, director of research for theAmerican Association of Individual Investors. But no one canaccurately forecast the market over the long term, he says.   And the cost of moving the money around means thatasset-allocation funds have higher expenses than the balancedfunds, says Mr. Rekenthaler.   The less-than-stellar performance might be worth it if thefunds really protected investors in a market downturn.Indeed, asset-allocation funds didn't take off until afterthe 1987 stock-market crash, when many fund groups convertedexisting funds into asset-allocation funds or started newones in response to investors' fears.   It isn't clear, however, whether these funds really wouldprotect an investor in a significant market slide. Most ofthem don't have long-term track records, says Michael Lipper,president of Lipper Analytical Services. &quot;There weren'tenough of them around in the October 1987 crash to make atest,&quot; he says.   In 1990, the market's most recent off year,asset-allocation funds lost money, though not quite as muchas the average stock fund. Lipper Analytical's numbers showthat in the worst quarter of that year, the third quarter,the average general stock fund fell 15.5%. The average U.S.asset-allocation fund declined 8.7%, and the average globalasset-allocation fund slipped 7.1%.   But the average balanced fund provided downside protectionjust about as good -- an 8% drop in the 1990 third quarter.   Kurt Brouwer, of Brouwer andamp; Janachowski, a San Franciscoinvestment adviser, doesn't think the asset-allocation funds'&quot;trade-off&quot; of some downside protection for lazy performanceon the upside &quot;is worth it.&quot; Says he: &quot;Quite frankly, theyhaven't done as well as the balanced funds. Their black boxesneed some tinkering.&quot;   Investors considering these funds should study theprospectuses. The funds' strategies vary widely -- as dotheir risks and their returns, says John C. Bogle, chairmanof Vanguard Group, the big Valley Forge, Pa., mutual fundfamily.   Some funds are &quot;stock-bond plays with very little cash,&quot;says Mr. Rekenthaler. &quot;Others are go-go funds that radicallyadjust what they are doing constantly. Some of these wildplayers have hurt&quot; the returns of the asset-allocationcategory.   Fidelity Asset Manager Fund, which has $1.1 billion ofassets, says it's a &quot;conservative to moderate&quot; riskasset-allocation fund. It can move only within certainparameters. Its normal exposure to stocks is 30%, but it cango as high as 50% in stocks or as low as 10%. Normal bondexposure is 40%, but it can move to a maximum of 60% or to aminimum of 20% in bonds. In the past 12 months, through Feb.6, the fund had a total return of 16.7%.   In contrast, Shearson Lehman Brothers MultipleOpportunities Fund, which has $129 million, is allowed toinvest in just about every type of security available. It canmove into U.S. and foreign stocks, bonds, cash, options andcommodities futures. It can also sell short and leverage itsassets by borrowing money. In the past 12 months, theShearson fund lost 1.2% on a total-return basis.   The newest wrinkle among asset-allocation funds is theglobal allocator, which not only shifts money from assetclass to asset class but from country to country. Vanguard'sMr. Bogle thinks global asset-allocation funds are just toocomplicated. &quot;I'm skeptical of a system that can get allthose layers right,&quot; he says. &quot;This is asking just too muchof a manager.&quot;   Mr. Markese suggests investors do their owndiversification, investing in several stock and fixed-incomemutual funds. He suggests splitting your stock money bythirds into a good large-company stock fund, a small-companyfund, and an international stock fund. Fixed-income moneyshould go in a money-market or short-term bond fund. &quot;Bediversified but don't try to move the money around,&quot; he says.   Mr. Brouwer recommends that conservative investors whowant some stock exposure use balanced funds instead ofasset-allocation funds. He suggests three that don't charge asales fee: CGM Mutual Fund, (a 28.7% total return in the 12months through Feb. 6); Fidelity Balanced Fund (19.5%); andVanguard's Wellington Fund (15.5%).</TEXT></DOC>
