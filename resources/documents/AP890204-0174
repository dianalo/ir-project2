Critics contend the bailouts negotiated by the Federal Home LoanBank Board are huge government giveaways with generous benefits forthe purchasers of sick Sandamp;Ls that will saddle taxpayers with billionsof dollars of open-ended obligations.   Board Chairman M. Danny Wall disputes those charges, saying theagency, which regulates the country's 3,000 Sandamp;Ls, is doing the bestit can to handle a gigantic problem with limited resources.   In December, the bank board negotiated deals involving 75bankrupt Sandamp;Ls in a year-end frenzy spurred by the fact thatlucrative tax benefits available to the buyers were to be slashed inhalf on Jan. 1.   The $16.7 billion in government aid promised in December alonedwarfed the combined $2.8 billion handed out to Chrysler Corp. andNew York City, the two previous record holders as the largestgovernment bailouts.   To attract buyers, the government included such sweeteners as:   _Multimillion-dollar tax breaks to some of the country'swealthiest investors that in many cases have far exceeded what theinvestors put up to purchase the Sandamp;Ls.   _Government guarantees extending over the next decade that makemany of the purchases virtually risk-free to the new Sandamp;L owners.   _Lucrative pay packages, which in one case will provide themanager of a conglomeration of failed Texas Sandamp;Ls with a salary of $1million a year for the next five years.   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, calls the deals, with their big taxbreaks, a ``back-door raid on the U.S. Treasury.''   ``One of the impressive aspects of these deals is that anoutsider can march in with very little capital and utilizesubstantial tax benefits,'' Leach said. ``If the thrift investmentworks, the outsider makes a riskless killing. If it doesn't, becauseof the nature of deposit insurance, the outsider has the rightsimply to walk away.''   With the government, once more, left holding the bag.   Charles O. Bowsher, head of the watchdog General AccountingOffice, told Congress the bailouts are so complex that justmonitoring them will strain the bank board's resources.   All of the controversy is coming as the Bush administration andCongress are trying to find a way to pay for the bailouts, past andfuture. The GAO estimates that in the deals negotiated so far,including 205 institutions closed in 1988, regulators have spent orpromised to spend $26 billion more than they will take in over thenext decade. The GAO projects that $35 billion more will be neededto handle 350 insolvent institutions still operating.   In a report last week, the GAO recommended that the governmentmove promptly to take control of the remaining insolvent Sandamp;Ls toisolate them from the healthy part of the industry.   For years, badly managed Sandamp;Ls were allowed to remain open becausefederal regulators didn't have the money to close them and pay offdepositors. All the while, the eventual bailout costs to the federalgovernment were mounting by $1 billion a month.   It is this crunch that has left the bank board, which regulatesSandamp;Ls but not banks, scrambling to craft inventive ways to handle themess.   Consider a medium-sized Sandamp;L with $1 billion in assets and $2billion in liabilities. The assets are home mortgages and realestate loans, the stocks in trade of an Sandamp;L. The liabilities aredepositors' savings. The institution is insolvent, with a negativenet worth of $1 billion.   If the bank board closed the Sandamp;L, the government would have topay out $2 billion immediately to depositors, who are protected byfederal insurance. Regulators would hope to recover the $1 billionrepresenting the failed institution's assets as it collected loanpayments and sold off repossessed properties.   This traditional approach, still used by regulators of thenation's 13,000 banks, requires huge up-front payments while waitingyears to recoup part of the expense.   That is a luxury Sandamp;L regulators don't have because theirinsurance fund, unlike the bank fund, is busted. Instead, the bankboard has hit upon a strategy that for the first time makes thegovernment the guarantor not only of deposits but of bad loans aswell.   Instead of taking over bad debts, the board is leaving them withthe new institutions and guaranteeing the new owners certain profitlevels for managing the soured loans.   The bank board's bailout strategy features these elements:   _PROMISSORY NOTES. These notes are provided by the board to bringan institution's net worth back up to zero. For an institution witha $1 billion negative net worth, that would mean pumping up itsassets with a $1 billion promissory note. The notes, which aretypically for 10 years, often carry an interest rate 2 percentagepoints higher than the cost that other financial institutions in theregion are paying to obtain funds.   For many new institutions, their biggest single asset is agovernment note. In 1988, the bank board issued $14 billion inpromissory notes and now has more than $20 billion in such notesoutstanding.   _GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES. In its year-end rush to close deals, thebank board agreed to protect new owners against losses on old loansover a 10-year period. These guarantees include ``capital losscoverage,'' whereby the government agrees to cover any losses on thebook value of a loan when it is eventually sold, and ``yieldmaintenance agreements,'' in which the government promises to makeup any loss of interest income on loans.   Many of the agreements covered every loan in a failed Sandamp;L exceptfor still-performing mortgages on single-family homes. Theseguarantees carried a price tag of $18 billion last year.   _TAX BREAKS. The board's assistance in the form of promissorynotes and guarantees is tax free. In addition, Sandamp;L purchasers havebeen allowed to deduct bad loans that had not been written off thefailed institution's books.   Congressional critics have complained because these taxwrite-offs can be carried from the acquired Sandamp;L to the investors'other businesses. Corporate takeover specialist Ronald O. Perelman,the head of Revlon cosmetics, came away with tax breaks worth $900million in his purchase of a group of failed Texas Sandamp;Ls, three timesthe capital he put into the deal. In all, the bank board dealt away$5 billion in tax breaks for 1988.   Beyond the tax breaks, the bank board projects that the Perelmandeal will cost the government $5.1 billion, including $2.9 billionin loan guarantees.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
