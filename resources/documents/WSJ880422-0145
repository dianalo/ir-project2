But recent studies of homicide rates by occupation suggest that they ought to think about it, especially if they want to drive a cab in gun-happy Texas.    A recent analysis of homicides by occupation in the Lone Star State reveals that, overall, murder is second only to motor vehicle accidents as a cause of death on the job, and that male cabbies have a murder rate 15 times higher than the combined rate of all other occupations.    Even prison inmates, policemen and detectives don't match it. The only male workers with a greater risk were sheriffs and court bailiffs. Among women, grocery clerks and waitresses led the list of risky occupations.    Not surprisingly, 72% of the murders occurred between 4 p.m and 8 a.m., and almost half of them were committed during armed robberies. Another 10% occurred during arguments between customers and employees; in Texas, the glove-compartment handgun is only a few steps away.    Is Texas unique? Not really. Although the state has a total murder rate more than twice as high as that of mellowed-out California, the incidence of murder on the job doesn't differ much in the two states. </TEXT></DOC>
