Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, considered a moderate among the Moslemguerrillas, was elected president with 174 votes, said sources closeto the assembly. Mojaddidi is leader of the Afghan NationalLiberation Front guerrilla group.   The 440 delegates chose hard-line fundamentalist Rasul Sayyaf asprime minister. Sayyaf is from the Ittehad-e-Islami rebel group. Hereceived 173 votes.   Fundamentalist factions advocate a strict Moslem system whilemoderates have pushed for a broad-based government in Afghanistanembracing Islam as its official religion.   Under a formula devised by a commission of Afghan fieldcommanders and scholars, the leader with the most votes becamepresident and minister of health. The second-highest vote-getterbecame prime minister and minister of communication, the sourcessaid.   Feuding between hardliners and moderates and between ShiiteMoslems and Sunni Moslems dominated the Islamabad council, or``shura,'' since it convened Feb. 10.   A spokesman for the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan saidits moderate leader, Ahmed Gailani, abstained from voting andexhorted his delegates to the shura to follow their conscience.   The shura, held at a religious compound on the outskirts ofIslamabad, was closed to journalists except for the final voteresults released late Thursday.   The Pakistan-based rebel alliance says the provisional governmentis to oversee the interim administration of Afghanistan until theguerrillas can form an Islamic republic of Afghanistan and holdformal elections in the country.   Guerrillas have predicted Afghanistan's communist government willsoon fall now that the Soviet soldiers who were helping Afghantroops fight the guerrillas have left the country.   The interim government lacks representation of Afghanistan'slargest minority, Shiite Moslems.   The majority of Afghan Shiite guerrillas live in Iran, and theyboycotted the shura after the Pakistan-based rebels, the majority ofwhom are Sunni Moslems, refused to give them the representation theysought.   The guerrillas have been fighting Afghanistan's government sincethe communists seized power in a bloody 1978 coup. Soviet forcesintervened in December 1979 and, under a U.N.-mediated accord,withdrew their troops by Feb. 15.   Afghanistan's official radio accused Pakistan on Thursday ofsending troops to help guerrillas attack the key eastern Afghan cityof Jalalabad.   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, claimed 1,600 armedPakistanis went to the border area of Afghanistan's Kunar Provinceto help in the assault.   The Kabul government summoned the Pakistani charge d'affaires anddemanded that he ``stop hostile actions against the democraticgovernment of Afghanistan,'' the radio said. ``Otherwise, the fullresponsibility may rest with the government of Pakistan.''   Afghanistan's official communist media repeatedly have claimedthat Pakistani, American and other ``foreign advisers'' haveinfiltrated their country to help insurgents fight the Kabulgovernment.   The accused countries deny the charges.</TEXT></DOC>
