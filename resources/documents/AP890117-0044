From the Midwest to Maine, snowfallhas been below normal and temperatures have been above normal.   ``Looking at the weather map and temperatures across the nation... one would never realize that it is the middle of January,'' theNational Weather Service said in a statement Monday night after themercury had climbed into the 40s and 50s across much of the country.Temperatures early today generally were in the 30s and 40s.   The relatively mild season has been a boon to motorists, joggersand municipal budgets but a bane for snowmobile dealers, winterfestival organizers and some ski resort operators.   ``We've really had to scrap with nature to get every bit of snowthis year,'' Matt Kelly said at Brodie Mountain Ski Resort inwestern Massachusetts, which reluctantly ``loaned'' Grafton, N.Y.,snow for its winter festival last weekend.   Meteorologists say climatic conditions, such as upper-atmospherewinds, haven't encouraged the kind of storms that leave a heavy snowcover.   ``It's pretty free of snow from the southern and central Plainsto the Atlantic Coast,'' Hugh Crowther of the National Severe StormsForecast Center in Kansas City, Mo., said today.   ``They have quite a bit of snow across the Northern Tier, butit's remaining up there.''   Much of the area from Burlington, Vt., to Bangor, Maine, was asbrown and bare Monday as it was last summer. Even in the region'sfar northern snow belt, snowfall has been far below normal.   As of Monday, Portland, Maine, had received a paltry 4.2 inchesof snow this winter, compared with a normal 30.2 inches.   Buffalo, N.Y. _ often the butt of snow jokes _ has received just16 inches, 30 inches below normal.   ``We're enjoying the weather right now,'' said Buffalo streetscommissioner Stan Buczkowski. ``But we're not going to kidourselves. We know we've got two months of winter left, and we'regoing to get some snow.''   In the Midwest, Iowa received just 1.3 inches last month, theseventh lowest December total in 102 years. Large areas of the statehad no snow at all. Temperatures averaged 25.9 degrees, 1.6 degreesabove normal, and on Dec. 2 Sidney and Indianola basked in balmy65-degree weather.   Illinois normally has had 16 inches of snow by now, but only 6inches have fallen. Temperatures have been 6 to 8 degrees higherthan the normal 29 degrees.   ``The 30-day outlook calls for continued mild weather, withtemperatures averaging about 60 to 65 percent above normal,'' AllanMorrison of the weather service said in Chicago.   In some sections of the Midwest hit hard by last summer's droughtand heat wave, the low snowfall is not expected to hurt thereplenishment of depleted water supplies, officials said. However, alack of snow cover can cause wind erosion, they said.   In the West, winter has been more familiar. Colorado, forexample, has had an average snow year, with ski resorts reportingbases of 30 inches to 86 inches.   While Western ski resorts have had little to worry about, somecross-country ski resorts in the East have had to close, officialssaid.   Some Eastern downhill ski resorts stayed in business by puttingsnow-making equipment to use, but others said bare ground in majorcities has made it tough to persuade would-be schussers to head forthe slopes. Cross-country races at festivals in several New Yorkcommunities have been canceled.   Many of the New York festivals, which bring in $5 million to $10million annually, don't start until late this month or earlyFebruary, but organizers are worried. Syracuse, where Winterfestbegins Jan. 27 and which normally gets 109.9 inches of snow, isbarren.   The weather has also put the brakes on snowmobile sales. InBrunswick, Maine, preseason sales were healthy but ``after Decemberit just fell flat on its face,'' said Chris Gould, who said fellowdealers reported it was the worst season since 1980.   But for those who miss the snow, there's always the chance of achange in the weather.   ``It can turn around in such a hurry that people may not betalking about lack of snow before long,'' weather servicemeteorologist Mike Noble said in Portland. ``We could see a lot ofsnow in a hurry.''</TEXT></DOC>
