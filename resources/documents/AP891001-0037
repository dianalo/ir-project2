An agreement between West Germany and Communist East Berlin onSaturday cleared the way for the exodus of thousands of EastGermans who had been holed up at Bonn's embassies in Prague andWarsaw for several weeks.   Trains left Prague Saturday night and Sunday with an estimated6,000 refugees and another 800 left Warsaw today.   East Germany said the transfer was a one-time occurrence, butrefugees hearing of the exodus began flooding embasies in thoseEast bloc capitals anyway in hopes of also securing safe passage tothe West.   In Prague, uniformed Czechoslovak police blocked the embassy andsquad cars later were positioned in all the streets leading to thecompound. All late arrivals, East Germans were turned back, but notbefore about 200 had gathered in front.   The crowd of latecomers _ most of them young, some with smallchildren _ milled about or sat in front of the embassy gate despiteword from an employee over the intercom system that the buildingwas closed for the day.   Their growing desperation ended abruptly at 5 p.m., when thepolicemen in front of the gate moved aside and Huber appeared.   Later Sunday, the West German Foreign Ministry in Bonn summonedCzechoslovak Ambasssador Dusan Spacil late Sunday to formallyprotest the police presence around the Prague embassy.   In a brief appearance earlier, Huber had urged the refugees togo back home.   ``Last night was a one-time situation,'' he said earlier of theexodus of thousands of East Germans on trains from Prague andWarsaw to West Germany. ``The occupation of the embassy will notimprove the situation.''   However, it was unclear now how Bonn would respond to the secondwave of would-be emigres or whether East Germany would allowanother transfer.   In Warsaw, dozens of East Germans also waited outside the WestGerman Embassy, including some who missed the train to the West byonly a few minutes.   The glum-looking refugees sat in cars or milled about thestreet, filling out forms for the embassy staff and wondering wherethey would spend the night.   Several said they were convinced that eventually there would beanother train for them.   The agreement between East and West Germany allowing the exodushighlighted the dramatic political changes at work in the East blocas Warsaw Pact nations slowly follow the lead of Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev, who has initiated widespread reform in hisown country.   The reform-oriented leadership in Hungary was the first to takeup the challenge presented by the East German refugees, opening itswestern border to them on Sept. 10.   East Germany, Czechoslovakia and other hard-line Warsaw Pactcountries have been critical of Hungary for opening its border.   Poland was reluctant to antagonize its ally in Berlin despitethe enormous political changes in Warsaw that led to the advent ofthe first East bloc government not led Communists. But Polishofficials did not inhibit the movement of the refugees around thecity, so they did not have to be crammed into embassy grounds.   The hard-line government in Prague pledged not to let EastGermans emigrate to the West through its territory. But onSaturday, West German television showed Czechoslovak policestanding by idly as refugees prepared for their trip west.   More than 100,000 East Germans have emigrated to West Germanythis year, taking advantage of a law automatically granting themcitizenship on arrival.   Among them are about 25,000 who emigrated over Hungary's westernborder. West German border police in Munich said Sunday nearly1,000 East Germans arrived via Austria from Hungary overnight _ thehighest number in recent days.</TEXT></DOC>
