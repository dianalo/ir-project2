While those whoare rich and getting richer can afford the very best, for the rest of Americathe dream of college is starting to move out of fiscal reach. Even as privatecollege fees rose 54 percent and public fees 27 percent, student aid increasedonly 11 percent over the last decade -- and most of that was loans, notscholarships.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  COLLEGES MUST LEARN CHEAPER TRICKS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Commentary; Bob Beyers, who directed Stanford University's news service formore than 25 years, is now an associate editor for the Pacific News Service.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Meanwhile parents of college-age kids -- Americans in their 40s and 50s--saw their average income drop 15 percent in real terms, putting the bestuniversities even farther beyond their reach. For those between the ages of 20and 25, the drop in income was more precipitous -- 25 percent. For thatone-fifth of the nation's preschool children being raised in poverty, collegemay be literally beyond the pale.;   To revive the fading dream of collegeeducation will take nothing short of radical reform of the entire educationalsystem.;   First and foremost, this will require moving away from the classiceducational model of a 30-student classroom with teacher and blackboard infront to new, technologically innovative forms of instruction. Much as thehealth care revolution shifted the emphasis from in-hospital care to fitnessand well-being, education policy-makers need to foster individual learningoutside the classroom.;   Second, universities must drastically improve theireducational effectiveness, rewarding their best teachers and freeingprofessors to develop new learning techniques.;   Third, more public resourcesmust be shifted away from higher education into elementary and secondaryschools -- a step college presidents themselves should advocate since it willultimately reduce the vast cost of remedial education colleges now bear.;  With slimmed down faculties, colleges will have to make more efficient use ofacademic capital. Above all, they will have to fight the trap of departmentalspecialization and encourage professors -- like general practitioners inmedicine -- to operate beyond the boundaries of their particular disciplineand institution. This would not only help cut costs and raise new revenues foreducation but would also expand access to those outside the academy.;   Everycollege has at least a few great lecturers whose courses could be recorded onaudio or videotapes, then distributed or sold to other audiences. Commercialfirms already offer &quot;America's best faculty&quot; on cassettes through Wall StreetJournal ads. Several alumni associations do the same, although many facultystill balk at what they consider unseemly commercialization of their roles.;  For more than three decades, Stanford has earned millions from broadcastingselected classroom courses live on closed circuit television to a network ofcompanies whose employees, if admitted as graduate students, can take them forcredit.;   A technique called tutored videotaped instruction takes the sameapproach a step further, combining tapes of the lectures with small groupinstruction. Discussion leaders -- not experts in the subjects being taught --meet with individuals in private homes and duplicate the syllabuses of collegecourses.;   A Stanford experiment with this approach found that theselearners, none of whom met criteria for admission to Stanford, nonethelessperformed as well or better than students who took the same course live inclass.;   Computers are also providing cheaper instruction than that offeredby traditional classroom teachers in courses ranging from Armenian to logic tomusic -- yet it's equally as effective. Once the programming is developed andtested by faculty, computers are available to students 24 hours a day.Students have rated computers as &quot;average&quot; teachers and much more patient thantheir human counterparts.;   Over time, the technology should move intomainstream use off campus. Computer-assisted learning is already making a dentin classrooms at the elementary and secondary school levels.;   Much moreexperimentation will be needed to keep the American dream of college botheffective and affordable. Even the affluent are likely to be more demandingnow that college costs twice the price of a Porsche.;   But the mostsuccessful experiments will be those that blur the long-standing barriersbetween the classroom and society, that liberate education from itstraditional classroom box.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BOB BEYERS  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910903  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  727  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, September 3, 199100247046,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
