But Byrd declined to offer details of the plan and cautionedthat ``the situation still is fluid.''   Meetings continued today and participants reported slowprogress. Byrd planned to add the aid package to a Pentagon moneybill if agreement could be reached on its details, and said hestill hoped to attract Republican support.   Meanwhile, President Reagan renewed his support for majorassistance for the Contras. ``Today, I call upon Congress to keepfaith with itself,'' he told a White House meeting of news mediaexeuctives.   Even as the Democrats met behind closed doors on Tuesday, SenateMinority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., was making pointed politicalreferences to the issue and seeking to highlight disagreementsbetween the two Democratic standard-bearers: Massachusetts Gov.Michael Dukakis, who opposes aid, and his vice-presidential runningmate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who has supported it.   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., one of those participating in theDemocratic drafting sessions, said the package would offercontinued humanitarian aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels andprovide for the release of some $16 million to $18 million inalready purchased weapons if certain conditions were met andCongress gave its consent in a later vote. It would provide no newmoney for lethal aid, he said.   Conditions for triggering the later vote would include continuedflows of Soviet weaponry into Nicaragua, violations of last year'sregional peace accord by the leftist Sandinista government and anyattempt by he Managua regime to militarily ``mop up'' the rebelforces, Kerry said.   The Contras have received no new military support since earlythis year, when Congress rejected lethal aid and a cease-firebetween the two sides took effect.   But some $16 million to $18 million in weapons bought withpreviously authorized money remain stockpiled in Contra warehousesand available for use if Congress gives the go-ahead and _ moreimportantly _ provides for a delivery mechanism like the CIA.   ``The true nature and intention of the Sandinistas are exposed.When are people in Congress who have been lied to for nine yearsgoing to get angry about it?'' Reagan said.   He said, ``After nine years of lies, broken promises andnon-compliance, the Sandinista mortgage is due.''   Sandinista ``subversion in Central America poses a risk all theway up to the Rio Grande,'' Reagan said.   In response to a question, Reagan said he supports a $47 millionpackage of military supplies and humanitarian aid to help theContras. He also said Congress should start by freeing the alreadypurchased weapons now stored in warehouses.   ``It is a political issue,'' Dole told reporters in one ofseveral appearances Tuesday that appeared designed to turn up thepolitical heat. ``There is a schism between the two candidates.''   Dukakis strongly opposes military support to the rebels fightingthe Managua government, while Bentsen consistently has voted forit. ``Senator Bentsen was right. Governor Dukakis is wrong,'' Doleadded.   Dole has proposed his own aid package, which includes $27million in new humanitarian aid for the rebels and $20 million innew military supplies. The lethal portion of the aid would bereleased only if Congress voted to do so at some later date. Dolevowed to attach his version to the first legislative vehicle whichcomes before the Senate.   ``If they want to starve the Contras ... then that's up to themajority Democrats and their nominee for president,'' Dole added,denying that his partisan attacks were part of any campaign to gethimself named to the GOP vice-presidential slot.   The issue is a delicate one for both parties. Democrats don'twant to be accused of starving the rebels out and giving a freehand to the Marxist Sandinista government. Republicans don't wantto be accused of derailing the now-faltering regional peace process.   Bentsen, meanwhile, called for an aid package that includesstandby military supplies for the Contras. He seemed to describe inbroad terms a package like the one being worked on by his fellowDemocrats.   ``We ought to fence what military aid has already been sent downthere and that (aid) be held there, and that the Sandinistasunderstand it's there and can be used and given to the Contras ifthey ... try to wipe out the Contras,'' Bentsen said.   He said he would support Contra aid when it comes to the floorlater this week, despite Dukakis' views on the subject. ``I havebeen voting my conscience in the Senate for 18 years, and I amgoing to continue to do that, and (Dukakis) accepts that.''</TEXT></DOC>
