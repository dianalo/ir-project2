 This trendraises numerous questions concerning the efficacy and hidden cost of suchsystems which may be poorly designed because of the users' lack of expertise.andO;Major tools used by users to develop their systems are database managementsystems (DBMSs) and fourth generation languages will DBMS capabilities.andO;Clearly the most popular DBMS for user application development is any of avariety of systems based on the relational data model [3].andP;  The relationalmodel is characterized by desirable properties like data independence andability to support high-level query languages [26].andM;Another trend likely to affect the use of database management systems is theproliferation of data models.andP;  The more recent data models are generallytermed semantic data models [31].andP;  The diffusion of information technology toend users coupled with the propositions of semantic data models raises thehuman factor issue of usability of these models.andP;  This article describes sucha usability study which compares representations developed by end users usingtwo popular data models--the relational, which is classical data model, andthe extended entity relationship (EER) model, which is a semantic data model.andM;DATA MODELSandM;In the general database design literature and in the practice of professionaldata analysts, the relational data model [8] has been used to conceptualizedata requirements [10, 26, 40].andP;  However, several researchers have noted ashortcoming of the relational model that it is difficult to capture certainsemantics of the real world.andP;  Schmid and Swenson [35] note that therelational theory gives no indication of the way in which the world is to berepresented by a collection of relations.andP;  Kent [24] has catalogued andexplicited the limitations of record-based information models, including therelational model.andP;  The limitations of the classical models have led toproposals for semantic data models (e.g., [4, 6, 17, 198 31, 37, 38]) thatare capable of coping with more intricate semantics inherent in manysituations.andP;  It seems that the most widely accepted semantic data model isChen's entity-relationship (E-R) model which explicitly adopts the view thatthe real world consists of entities and relationships [6].andP;  Chen introducedan associated graphical representation technique as a tool for databasedesign.andP;  Recently, the E-R model has been extended to include the notion ofcategories [15].andP;  This model is called the extended entity-relationship (EER)model.andP;  Teorey et al.andP;  [41] present the EER model as a logical design toolthat can be used to conceptualize data requirements.andP;  The EER representationcan then be converted to a relational representation (or any other datamodel) for database implementation.andP;  Thus implicitly, these authors make theassumption that the EER model, as compared to the relational model, is thebetter representation for conceptual design.andP;  However, there is littleempirical evidence that the EER model or any other semantic model leads tobetter novice end-user performance than the classical models in a conceptualdata modeling task.andM;THE NOVICE USER AND DATABASE DESIGNandM;Database technology is now readily available for application to nontrivialproblems by end users.andP;  The phenomenon of end-user computing has beensupported by relational data management technology.andP;  End users may beautonomous, that is, users who design, develop, implement, and useapplication programs to support personal or a small group's informationrequirements for decision making [12, 13].andP;  To build effective systems, theseusers not only need easy-to-use software, but a basic knowledge of techniquesabout system analysis and design as well.andP;  Since most information systemshave a database component, it is important that these users understand thedatabase design process and techniques.andM;The first step of database design is the development of the conceptual datamodel of the application.andP;  A conceptual data model is an abstraction of thereal world (organizational) data pertinent to an enterprise.andP;  The process ofderiving and analyzing the data inherent in a business situation and ofmapping objects of this understanding of reality in a conceptual modelrepresentation constitutes the discovery phase.andP;  The discovery phase consistsof two parts.andP;  The first part involves the elicitation of the informationrequirements.andP;  This is traditionally a result of an interview between theuser(s) and the analyst(s).andP;  The second part, in the data modeling context,involves the (conceptual) representation of the information requirements intothe form of a conceptual model.andP;  In this process, a data model providesrepresentation primitives to aid in the development and specification of aconceptual model.andP;  It also provides a discipline that can highlightinconsistencies in one's qualitative understanding of a situation.andP;  In thecase of end-user-developed applications, the discovery phase predominantlyinvolves representation, and only minimally involves elicitation since theuser-analyst communication gulf is eliminated.andM;This study concentrates on the second part of this phase, that is, thetranslation of one's understanding of a business situation into arepresentational form for a conceptual database.andP;  (We assert that even thoughthe requirements are available, the important task of &quot;fitting&quot; theserequirements into a conceptual model remains.)andP;  One may question therelevance of this phase and argue that some kind of a conceptual model isalready available at the end of the elicitation process, albeit in a naturallanguage.andP;  Yet, the transformation into a formal representation may not betrivial.andP;  An analogy may be drawn from the formulation of complexmathematical models which are essentially representations of problems firstconceptualized and expressed in a natural language.andM;The purpose of this article is to report the design and results of a studythat was conducted to test if the use of a semantic model instead of arelational model results in superior end-user performance.andP;  The semanticmodel used was the EER model.andP;  A pilot study, termed here as the first pilotstudy, was conducted in November 1987.andP;  The main purpose of this study was toidentify any procedural problems.andP;  The data collected from the first pilotwas not used for analysis.andP;  The data for the reported study was collectedduring February 1988 and September 1988.andM;PRIOR RESEARCHandM;A survey of human factors studies on databases suggests that most of theresearch has focused on programming tasks using database query languages(DBQLs).andP;  The interested reader may refer to a survey article by Reisner[32].andP;  However, the focus of our study was on data representation rather thandata manupulation.andP;  Therefore, we have not included the literature aboutdatabase query languages, and present only the literature relevant to thescope of our study.andP;  Reisner's survey deserves mention, however, since itfocuses on some important variables that seem to be consistently used in thehuman factor studies on query languages.andM;Most studies covered in Reisner's survey compare different query languages,so query language was obviously one of the variables.andP;  She stated that themethodology used to compare query languages is an extension of human factors,and, therefore, the studies include a measure of user performance as well asa set of tasks to capture some aspect of user performance.andP;  Although notexplicitly, Reisner also considers the characteristics of subjects whoparticipated in the studies.andP;  For example, some of the studies compare theperformance of nonprogrammers with that of programmers.andP;  Other studiescompare the performance of less experienced subjects with more experiencedones.andP;  Thus, at least implicitly, the variable human is considered in thesestudies.andP;  Reisner's survey of query language studies shows.andP;  Reisner's surveyof query language studies shows, therefore, that the laboratory studies oncomparison of query languages implicitly consider the following variables:data models, human, task, and user performance.andP;  The general framework ofthese studies, therefore, is similar to the (explicit) framework used inother MIS experiments [22].andM;A literature survey on human factors studies on data models revealed that thestudies can be classified into two categories--studies that compare oneclassical model with another classical model, and studies that compare therelational model with a semantic data model.andP;  The more recent studies fall inthe second category.andP;  The studies were also scrutinized to infer if theframework which applied to query languages was also applicable to datamodels.andM;One of the earliest published studies was performed by Lochovsky andTsichritzis [25], who compared the three classical models--hierarchical,network, and relational.andP;  Each model was implemented by using a differentlanguage: the IMS language DL/I [21], the DBTG COBOL DML [7], and ALPHA [9],respectively.andP;  Fifty-eight subjects were given query-writing tasks.andP;  Resultsshow that for less experienced users, relational group scores aresignificantly better than the other two groups.andP;  Though the authors concludethat the relational model is superior, they point out that it is difficult toascribe the results either to the data model or to the language sincedifferent models used different query languages.andM;To overcome the problem of query languages confounding the effects of datamodels, Brosey and Shneiderman [5] compared relational and hierarchicalmodels using instance diagrams.andP;  Comprehension, problem solving situation,and memorization tasks were performed by undergraduate subjects.andP;  Significanteffects are found for the data model, presentation order, subject background,and tasks.andP;  The hierarchical model was easier to use, but only for thebeginning programmer group.andP;  The conceptual model used in the experiment ishierarchical in structure, and may have favored the hierarchical model.andM;Durding et al.andP;  [14] conducted three experiments to investigate how peopleorganize data.andP;  This study does not use specific data models (and is,therefore, not included in Table I).andP;  Results show that the subjectsorganized most word sets based on semantic relations inherent in them.andP;  Theseresults suggest that the ease of use of a model depends upon the inherentstructure of data in an application.andP;  However, real world applications aregenerally a mix of various structures.andP;  This study did not, therefore,provide answers to whether any organization approach in general was better.andM;We note that the three studies just described had different implications.andO;The Lochovsky and Tsichritzis study [25] found that the relational model isbetter, the Brosey and Shneiderman study [5] concludes that the hierarchicalmodel is better, and the Durding et al.andP;  study [14] concludes that there isan interaction between the performance using a data structure and theunderlying semantic structure of the application.andP;  It is clearly evident thatno data model is better in all cases.andP;  In the Lochovsky study, the datamanipulation task results in a better performance for the relational model.andO;They also found that programmers did better than nonprogrammers, so humancharacteristics also affected the modeling performance.andP;  In the Brosey study,too, programmers performed better than nonprogrammers.andP;  Further, thedescription of the application (task) seemed to result in superiorperformance using the hierarchical model.andP;  Thus the divergent results foundin these studies could be explained by considering the framework which showsuser performance as dependent on data model, task, and human variables.andO;While the framework is more implicit than explicit in these studies, it doessuggest that user performance not only depends on data models, but also onthe specific task and the characteristics of the designer or the user.andM;Hoffer [18] first reported the result of an investigation of individualdifferences in using database models.andP;  He found that subjects haveindividualized images of a database, and that a process flow structure is themost frequently used image.andP;  He also reported that subjects omitidentification of database keys from their images and are not able to clearlyspecify data relationships.andP;  The subjects used a variety of data models whichsupports the earlier suggestion that a typical application would involve amix of structures, and hence is unlikely to be naturally suited to a specificdata model.andM;Even though these experiments did not provide any distinct conclusions aboutthe relative ease of use of the relational model, it seems that the ease ofuse of relational systems is now widely accepted.andP;  The major factorresponsible for this is probably the ability of the model to support anonprocedural query interface.andP;  However, the ability of nonexpert users tosuccessfully use the relational model for conceptual modeling is still underquestion.andM;Recent studies comparing data models use relational models as one andsemantic data models as the other treatment.andP;  Since no popular commercialimplementations are based on semantic data models, the comparison has been atthe conceptual level only.andP;  It may be argued, however, that the relationalmodel is no longer pertinent for conceptual modeling, and hence such acomparison may not be fair.andP;  On the other hand, it may be inappropriate tomake such a statement without some empirical evidence.andP;  In a study comparinghow expert and  novice designers develop relational representations, Batraand Davis [1] found that most experts and novices prepare the relationalrepresentation without using an intermediate model even though they are awareof other data models.andM;Studies comparing the relational model with semantic data models at theconceptual level have focused on elicitation and representation [33] andvalidation [23].andP;  Shoval and Even-Chaime [36] compare two modelingtechniques--normalization and information analysis--and focused on therepresentation phase.andM;Juhn and Naumann [23] focused on the user validation process in databasedesign.andP;  They found that the graphical models (entity relationship andlogical data structure) are more understandable than the relational and dataaccess diagram in relationship existence-finding and cardinality-findingtasks.andP;  On the other hand, relational models did outperform graphical modelswith respect to identifier compehension tasks.andM;Ridjanvic [33] conducted a lab experiment using MIS MBA students toinvestigate differences in the quality of data representations produced bynonexperts using the Logical Data Structure (LDS) and the Relational DataModel (RDM) formalisms.andP;  The subjects were asked to read a case, askquestions, and generate application data models which were then evaluatedusing an instrument developed by the researcher.andP;  Results indicated that,contrary to the author's hypotheses, the LDS subjects' questions were notrelationship-driven, and the RDM subjects' questions were notattribute-driven.andP;  On comparing the two representations, it was found thatthere are significant differences in the number of relationships in favor ofLDS and in the number of attributes in favor of the RDM group.andM;Shoval and Even-Chaime [36] compared two different methods for designing adatabase schema, normalization and information analysis (IA).andP;  Thenormalization method is based on the relational data model.andP;  The informationanalysis method is based on the binary relationship model developed byNijssen [29].andP;  The study involved 26 analysts who were trained to use the twomethods with the structured analysis method of system analysis.andP;  There wasevidence that the quality of the database schemata designed usingnormalization was better than that designed using IA, that normalizationrequired less time than IA to perform, and that the analysts preferrednormalization.andP;  The authors suggest, however, that the IA model may be moresuitable for complex tasks.andM;On comparing the Juhn and Naumann [23] study with the Shoval and Even-Chaime[36] study, it seems that the results are mixed.andP;  Juhn and Naumann seem tosuggest that the semantic data models are better while Shoval and Even-Chaimeconclude that the relational model is better.andP;  In fact, Juhn and Naumannfound that even for the same task, the results favor the graphical models onsome aspects, and the relational model on another.andP;  Once again, one canconclude that it is difficult to make sweeping generalizations about theeffectiveness of a data model.andP;  It is important to include the task and thehuman variables that interact with data model.andM;Our study extends the existing literature about laboratory studies comparingdata models.andP;  First, it is complementary both to the Juhn and Naumann studysince it considers the representation phase which is more appropriate for theend user rather than the validation phase which is more appropriate for auser-analyst scenario, and to the Shoval and Even-Chaime study since itconsiders the (less experienced) end user instead of the (more experienced)analyst.andP;  Finally, the study extended Ridjanovic's study by defining adetailed criterion for user performance.andP;  The study compared data models interms of facets, which are at a level finer than the conceptual model and arediscussed in the following section.andP;  The study goes beyond gross measures ofuser performance, like number of relationships, to a finer measure ofmodeling correctness.andP;  Thus, the study extends the line of research ofusability issues of data modeling.andM;RESEARCH METHODOLOGYandM;Research ModelandM;The broad purpose of this study was to compare classical and semantic models.andO;The research model is shown in Figure 1.andP;  The independent, dependent, andcontrol variables are now explained.andM;Independent VariablesandM;Specific models had to be selected to represent each type.andP;  The relationalmodel was selected as a classical model, and the extended entity relationship(EER), as a semantic model.andP;  The relational model was selected since it isnow generally accepted that relational systems lead to significantly betteruser performance in query writing tasks than other classical systems [25].andO;Further, the relational model has been the basis for several PC-based DBMSsand other end-user development tools.andP;  The EER model [15] was selected sinceit is an extension of the ER model which has been a widely accepted semanticdata model.andP;  Further, the EER model has been formally presented as aconceptual modeling tool [41].andM;Control VariablesandM;Task and human were selected as the control variables in the experiment.andO;Since the purpose of the study was to compare user performance between therelational and the EER models in the conceptual representation phase ofdatabase design, a task that required users to read a case and represent thecharacteristics of data as a conceptual model was selected.andP;  The user typewas selected based on computer experience and mode of use.andP;  This studyfocused on novice end users, that is, users who have limited databaseexperience and who design their own applications.andP;  Students enrolled in anintroductory MIS class were recruited and trained to use a modelingtechnique.andP;  The students had little or no database design background beforethey were trained.andM;Dependent VariableandM;The main performance variable, modeling correctness, can be defined as thedegree to which a conceptual model approaches the correct solution(s), wherethe correct solution(s) convey the same semantics about data as the naturallanguage description of the application.andP;  There was no restriction on thenumber of correct solutions if they translated to the same semantics.andO;Modeling correctness was measured at the level of facets.andP;  For example, abinary one-many relationship is one facet that may occur in a conceptual datamodel.andP;  A short explanation of the notion of facet follows.andM;A data model may be considered as consisting of various constructs likeentities, relationships, attributes, etc.andP;  A construct-like entity requires afairly consistent set of modeling rules and uniform representation.andO;Essentially, one has to be able to classify an object as an entity or anattribute.andP;  However, there is no consistent way of modeling relationshipssince they may differ in degree and connectivity.andP;  Representation of arelationship depends on its degree.andP;  For example, unary relationships aremodeled differently than binary relationships.andP;  A change in connectivity of arelationship also changes its representation.andP;  Hence, it is not appropriateto discuss a conceptual model at the general level of relationships: one mustqualify the relationships with their degree and connectivity.andP;  It is,therefore, pertinent to introduce a construct which is more detailed.andP;  Thisconstruct is termed a facet.andP;  Different instances of a facet have the samerepresentation.andP;  Different facets have different representation.andP;  Forexample, since any instance of a many-many binary relationship is modeled thesame way, a many--many binary relationship is a facet.andM;An important task in this study was to create a list of facets that could beincluded in the study.andP;  A general criterion used to qualify facets was theeach facet should commonly occur in real world applications.andP;  A review oftypical conceptual models found in textbooks and journal papers provideduseful information.andP;  For example, relationships of degree higher than three(ternary) were not found in the literature.andP;  Another criterion was that thedifficulty level of the facet should not be beyond the capability of thetypical subject.andP;  The first pilot study (November 1987) was very useful insuggesting the limits of representation capabilities of the subjects.andP;  Basedon these criteria, the following facets were identified as ones which couldbe included in the study: entity, indentifier, descriptor, category, and thefollowing types of relationships: unary, binary one-many, binary many-many,ternary one-many-many, and ternary many-many-many.andM;A comparison of the relationship and the EER representations revealed thatthe facets entity, descriptor, and category were of limited for this studysince there is no explanation to suggest that the user performance using oneof the two models could be expected to be better.andP;  Therefore, this articledoes not include a to be better.andP;  Therefore, this article does not include adiscussion of these three facets.andM;The correctness scores in each of the other facets of the conceptual model(e.g., unary relationship, etc.) were graded separately.andP;  The scores onindividual facets were, however, not added up to give a measure of an&quot;overall&quot; modeling correctness score since it would have been a function ofthe included facets only.andP;  There seemed to be serious construct validityconcerns with forming a composite score by adding scores (arithmetically orby assigning weights) obtained in individual facets.andP;  For example, there wasno justification for adding a score obtained in a binary one-manyrelationship with that obtained in a ternary many-many-many relationshipunles the weights based on the relative complexity and the frequency ofoccurrence of the two facets could be specified.andM;Davis (1985) defines perceived ease of use as the degree to which anindividual believes that using a particular system would be free of physicaland mental effort.andP;  This definition, in the present context, can be modifiedas the degree to which an individual believes that using a data model forconceptual design would be free of mental effort.andP;  This variable was exploredwhen the experiment was run in September 1988 by using an instrument (seeinset) which was essentially adapted from a perceived ease-of-use instrumentdeveloped by Davis (1985).andM;Variables as CovariatesandM;The study involved 42 subjects, twenty-one in each treatment.andP;  Since thesubjects were randomly assigned to the treatments, it was expected thatpossible effects because of confounding variables will be minimal because ofthe averaging effect.andP;  However, one variable, database experience, wastreated as a coveriable since it threatened to be a serious confound ifrandomization was not achieved.andP;  A selection strategy was used that wouldmaximize homogeneity in subject profile.andP;  Study subjects were solicited fromvarious sections of an introductory course in MIS.andP;  A typical student hadprogramming but not database design experience.andP;  While it seemed that a fairdegree of randomization was achieved (Table II), the variable was,nevertheless, treated as a covariate.andM;HYPOTHESESandM;In this section, seven hypotheses addressed by the study are presented.andP;  Fivehypotheses were relationship-based, one each pertained to identifiers andperceived ease of use.andP;  The null forms of the hypotheses are not presented.andM;For representing a relationship and its characteristics, EER provides adirect method, that is, a notation.andP;  In contrast, the relational modelaccomplishes this by associating identifiers of the involved entities.andP;  Thisstudy included the following kinds of relationships: unary, binary one-many,binary many-many, ternary one-many-many, and ternary many-many-many.andP;  For alltypes of relationships, it was predicted that better performance would beachieved using the EER model.andP;  Thus, the hypotheses were:andM;The EER model, as compared to the relational model, will lead tosignificantly better user performance in modeling:andM;H1) unary relationships.andM;H2) binary one-many relationships.andM;H3) binary many-many relationships.andM;H4) ternary one-many-many relationships.andM;H5) ternary many-many-many relationships.andM;These relationship-based hypotheses were explained by applying the conceptsdeveloped by Hutchins, Hollan, and Norman (1985) in their model of thehuman-computer interface.andP;  According to their human-computer interface model,there is a gulf (or directness distance) between user's goals and knowledgeof the application domain, and the level of description provided by thesystems with which the person must interact.andP;  The amount of cognitive effortit takes to manipulate and evaluate a system is directly proportional to thisdistance.andP;  One can identify two different kinds of distances, semantic andarticulatory, that have to be spanned between the user and the conceptualmodel.andP;  In the context of database design, semantic distance is concernedwith the relationship of the meaning of the conceptual model to user'sknowledge of real world data.andP;  Since a conceptual model is composed ofobjects, properties of these objects, and the association between theseobjects, the semantic distance relates to the distance between these realworld semantics and the constructs provided by the data model for developingthe conceptual data model.andP;  Articulatory distance is related to the meaningof the conceptual data model and its physical form.andP;  Thus, a relational modelhas a tabular form, while the EER model has a pictorial form.andM;It was hypothesized that the EER model would facilitate lower semanticdistance than the relationship model because it captures the characteristicsof the relationships beteen entitles in a more direct fashion.andP;  In fact, theEER model has a special symbol for a relationship which captures its degreeand connectivity.andP;  The relational model, on the other hand, capturesrelationshps in a more complicated manner, and will lead to a larger semanticdistance.andP;  For example.andP;  Figure 2 shows a problem represented using therelational and the EER model.andP;  The relationships MADE BY and CITY OF MFR areboth binary relationships.andP;  However, the connectivity of MADE BY is one-many,and CITY OF MFR is many-many.andP;  In the EER representation, the symbolsrepresenting the relationships are similar except that they reflectdifferences in connectivity.andP;  The relational representation shows lessuniformity.andP;  The relationship MADE BY is not shown explicitly, but isimplicitly captured by embedding the identifier MFR NAME in the relationVEHICLE (since the key VEH NO can functionally determine the key MFR NAME).andO;However, the relationship CITY OF MFR requires that a separate relation bedefined (since, between MFR NAME and CITY NAME, no once key can functionallydetermined the other).andP;  Thus there is lack of a consistent rule in modelingrelationships.andP;  Using the relational model, the problem is likely to get moreacute as the degree of the relationship is increased since there will be morepossible combination of connectivity, and therefore a larger number of rulesto represent the relationships.andP;  This may confuse a nonexpert user.andM;It was also hypothesized that the EER model, as compared to the relationalmodel, would lead to lower articulatory distance.andP;  An EER representation hasa graphical form (articulation) as opposed to the relational representationwhich has a textual/tabular, unidimensional form.andP;  Of course, as has beenfrequently documented in the MIS literature, there is no guarantee that agraphical form, as compared to a tabular form, would lead to superiorperformance.andP;  The superiority of a form is essentially function of task.andP;  Inthis particular context, it was hypothesized that the availability of agraphical formalism would facilitate modeling of relationships.andP;  Thisargument is based on two main reasons.andP;  First, in an EER representation, arelationship is always shown explicitly between the oject.andP;  Thus, if two realworld objects, like VEHICLE and MANUFACTURER, have a relationship betweenthem, then the representation for the relationship is shown connecting therepresentations for the entities involved in the relationships.andP;  However, inthe relational representation, the relationship is represented by associatingthe identifiers of the objects, and not representations of the objectsthemselves.andP;  Second, since a relationship, by its very definition, is anassociation between objects, the connection of objects by graphically linkingthem in an EER representation is a more direct way of showing thereationship.andP;  There are no explicit links in a relational representation.andM;The hypothesis on modeling of identifiers was formulated in favor of therelational model.andP;  In either of the models, an identifier serves to uniquelydistinguish instances of an entity.andP;  However, in the relational model,identifiers are also used to define the relationships between entities.andO;Therefore, it was expected that there would be better discipline inspecifying identifiers using the relational model.andM;This difference may be explained by the notion of a forcing function [30].andP;  Aforcing function is present when there is some feedback from the world thatprevents an operation from taking place if it were being done erroneously.andO;Thus, the design of a system should &quot;force&quot; a certain sequence of actions sothat errors are prevented.andP;  In the relational model, relationships aredefined using identifiers of the involved entities, therefore, therepresentation of the relationships forces the definition of the identifiers.andM;H6) The relational model, as compared to the EER model, will lead tosignificantly better user performance in specifying identiers of therespective entitiesandM;It was hypothesized that the same reasons which lea to better userperformance in modeling relationships would also lead to the perception thatthe EER model is easier to use.andP;  The relationships seem to be the mostdifficult component in conceptual modeling since they capture a lot ofsemantics.andP;  The EER model, with a more direct approach of modelingrelationships, was expected to be, therefore, easier to use.andM;H7) Users would perceive EER model, as compared to the relational model, ashigher in ease of use.andM;Research StrategyandM;A laboratory study was conducted to address the research question.andO;Tradionally, the laboratory has been the setting for most human factorresearch.andP;  In fact, the laboratory-based research strategy has been used inall data modeling studies comparing user performance.andP;  The main advantages ofthe laboratory method are high internal validity [39], precise definition andmanipulation of independent variable over feasible ranges [16], and controlfor nuisance variables or extraneous variables [27].andM;The task required subjects to develop a representation using one of the twomodels.andP;  A description of the application to be represented was adapted fromthe example in ]41] and is presented in Appendix A.andP;  The relational and theEER solutions are presented in Appendix B and Figure 3, respectively.andP;  Recallthat any solution semantically equivalent to these was also acceptable.andP;  Theapplication description was not biased in favor of any of the models since itincludes most of the facets typically found in database design, that is, thetask is not restricted to one or few facts.andP;  The description of the problemwas presented in text form.andP;  It was devoid of any pictures or tables.andO;Although the problem is nontrivial, the domain of the problem (which dealswith an employee database) is simple.andP;  These precautions were intended toavoid bias in favor of any model.andP;  The problem was tested in the first pilotfor any ambiguities and lack of clarity, and based on the feedback from thesubjects, was enhanced and used in the main study.andM;Graduated students were recruited mainly from introductory MIS courses.andO;Forty-two subjects participated in the study.andP;  The subjects came from avariety of majors.andP;  There was no monetary incentive to participate in thestudy.andP;  The incentive offered to subjects was the training in certain aspectsof database design.andP;  Participation in the experiment was voluntarily, andsubjects could withdraw from the experiment at any time.andP;  The investigatorobserved fairly high motivation.andM;The database experience of the subjects (from either prior work or education)was controlled to a fair extent by the selection process.andP;  Since the subjectswere recruited from introductory courses in MIS, a large majority of them hadhad no formal database courses.andP;  The subjects filled in a questionnairethatcollected data about their computer experience.andP;  Then based on theirdatabase experience they were pllaced into one of the six categories (TableII).andP;  Subjects using the relational model had a mean scor of 2.0, while thoseusing the EER had a mean score of 1.96.andP;  This suggests that randomizationaveraged out any invidivual differences in database design.andP;  Further, sincedatabase experience is an important variable, it was also treated as acovariate.andP;  The variations in database experience were measured before anytraining.andP;  Explicit training of subjects on the conceptual representationtask further minimized differences in database experience.andP;  An analysis ofcovariance using database experience as a covariate revealed that thevariable did not seem to signifacantly affect user performance.andM;A few days before the laboratory session, consenting subjects were providedwith a short note &quot;Conceptual Modeling,&quot; which introduced them to the basicterminology generaly used in database design.andP;  Each subject was given anappointment for the experiment.andP;  Appointments were allotted so that typicallyfour subjects would participate in an epxperimental session.andM;The actual experiment had the following sequence:andM;1.andP;  The subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire related to personaldemographics and computer experience.andM;2.andP;  They were then provided with a set of notes and trained by theexperimenter for approximately 45 to 50 minutes in using one of the models.andO;The training notes for each model had been reviewed by database faculty, toensure that the script was not biased in favor of any model.andP;  Further, twoindependent reviewers sat through some of the training sessions, and ratedthe equivalence of the training.andP;  This was done to check for any experimenterbias.andM;3.andP;  The subjects were asked to develope, in a suggested time of 30 minutes, aconceptual model for an empoyee database.andP;  They were not forced to stop afterthe suggested time had elapsed.andP;  They were provided with a textua descriptionof the problem and allowed the use of the training notes to complete thetask.andM;4.andP;  After each subject had finished the task, a debriefing questionnaire wasprovided to the subject so that he/she could provide feedback and report anyambiguities in the exercise.andM;Grading SchemeandM;The representation prepared by each subject was graded for correctness bythree raters by comparing it with the correct solution.andP;  The problem and thesolution were adapted from [41].andP;  The grading scheme (Table III) was designedto provide maximum consistency of scoring between the two models, and withthe data modeling training.andP;  The raters were provided with the grading schemeand supporting explanations of the scheme.andM;Each facet was graded separately.andP;  A score of 1 was awarded for each correctfacet and 0 for incorrect or missing facet.andP;  Partial credit was given forpartially correct representations.andP;  To facilitate this, errors wereclassified as minor, medium, or major, and 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 werededucted, respectively.andM;The grading scheme was developed primarily from an analysis of errors foundin the solutions prepared by subjects in the first pilot.andP;  The frequentlyoccurring errors were categorized based on the severity as minor, medium, ormajor.andP;  The scheme was evaluated by faculty experienced in teaching databasecourses, and any proposed changes were discussed, and if necessary,implemented.andP;  When the final scheme was formulated, it was found that none ofthe frequently occurring errors could be classified as major errors.andP;  Thus,the grading scheme (Table III) shows minor and medium errors only.andP;  Errorsfound in the representations prepared by the subjects and not covered by thegrading scheme were classified as minor, medium, or major depending on therater's perception of severity of the errors.andM;RESULTS AND INTERPRETATIONSandM;Three raters independently graded the representations prepared by subjects.andO;The final scores so obtained were averaged over the three raters and thenconverted to percentages.andP;  The overall inter-rater reliability (Cronbach'salpha) was found as 0.97.andP;  The results from the comparison of means of facetsand perceived ease of use are shown in Table IV.andP;  The mean correctness scoresare in percentages.andP;  The study used a critical significance level ([alpha])for each test of facet means as 0.01.andP;  There was little difference betweenthe time taken by the relational (36.1 minutes) and the EER (35.3 minutes)groups to complete the exercise.andM;The unary (hypothesis H1)--that the EER model, as compared to the relationalmodel, would lead to a significantly higher score--was not supported.andP;  Infact, the relational group scored higher by 13.1 percent, although this didnot result in significance (p = 0.26).andP;  It was felt that the higher score incase of the relational model may be because of a more concrete method ofmodeling unary relationships.andP;  For example, in the case given to the subject,a unary relationship was required to capture the following semantics: &quot;If anemployee is married to another employee of Projects Inc., then it is requiredto store the date of marriage and who is married to whom.andP;  However, no recordneed be maintained if the spouse of an employee is not an employee of thefirm.&quot;andP;  Even though the relationship involves only one entity, an instance ofa relationship involves distinct instances (the employee and the spouse whois also an employee) of the EMPLOYEE entity.andP;  In a relational model, this canbe captured by the following representation:andM;MARRIAGE(EMP#, SPOUSE#, DATE OF MAR)andM;As can be seen above, this is concretely captured by EMP# and SPOUSE# in therelational model.andP;  However, in case of the EER model, it is captured by arelationship symbol with two links to one entity (refer to Figure 3).andP;  Thishides the fact that the relationship is between two instances of the sameentity.andP;  This was also evident by the fact that some subjects showed SPOUSEas a separate entity and then showed the marriage relationship as binary.andM;Both hypotheses H2 and H3, one-many and many-many (binary) relationships weresupported.andP;  Subjects using the EER model made considerably fewer errors.andP;  Thesignificance level for the binary one-many hypothesis was 0.0035, while thatfor the binary many-many was 0.0007.andM;The results clearly note the inadequacy of the relational model for capturingbinary relationships.andP;  In fact, the problems about the way the relationalmodel captures relationships were evident.andP;  First, there is an inconsistencyproblem since the connectivity of the relationship dictates if it will becaptured explicitly (e.g., many-many), or implicitly (e.g., one-many).andP;  Anumber of connectivity errors were found.andP;  Second, the relationships arerepresented by associating the identifiers of the involved entities, not theentities themselves.andP;  It was found that subjects occasionally attempted tocapture a relationship by using the entity names, not their identifiers.andO;Another error that was found was the reciprocal inclusion of identifers, thatis, the relationship was captured between two entities by including theidentifier of each entity in the relation for the other entity.andM;The inadequacy of the subjects using the relational model to represent binaryrelationships is a significant finding since these seem to be the most commontypes of relationships found in most databases.andP;  Similar errors were rarelyfound in the EER representations prepared by the subjects.andM;The score was significantly higher for the EER group in case of the ternaryone-many-many relationship (p = 0.0004), but not for the ternarymany-many-many relationship (p = 0.33).andP;  The most important observation wasthe sharp fall in the scores in general as compared to scores pertaining tobinary relationships.andM;These results suggest three important points.andP;  First, for novice end users,ternary relationships are difficult to model.andP;  In fact, one should not expectsuch users to model relatioships of degree higher than 3.andP;  Second,relationships where the connectivity is partly one and partly many seem to bemore difficult to model.andP;  Finally, the EER model seems to lead to better userperformance although this eas not fully supported since the hypothesis H5pertaining to the many-many-many relationship was not statisticallysignificant.andM;Regarding the identifiers (hypothesis H6), the mean score for the relationalmodel was 72.4 and that for the EER model was 73.9.andP;  There was no significantdifference between the mean scores of the two treatment groups.andP;  This wascounter to the hypothesis which predicted higher score for the relationalgroup.andP;  In fact, both groups seemed to perform well.andP;  It may seem somewhatcontrary to Hoffer's finding which reported that subjects frequently omittedspecifications of identifiers.andP;  It is felt that the training imparted to thesubjects, which stressed specifications of identifiers, was probablyresponsible for our results.andP;  Another reason for the good performance may bethe application description, which in most cases specified or suggested anidentifier.andP;  It may be interesting to see the results if no identifier isindicated in the application description.andM;Perceived ease of use of a data model is the degree to which an individualbelieves that using the data model would be free of mental effort.andP;  Thehypothesis that the EER model, as compared to the relational model, wouldlead to greater perceived ease of use (hypothesis H7) was not supported.andP;  Ona scale that represented highest ease of use at 1, and lowest ease of use at7, the mean score of the EER group was 3.42, and the mean score of therelationship group was 3.78.andP;  A t-test indicated that this difference had asignificance level of 0.50, which was not significant.andP;  This shows that, forthe category of users considered in the study, the relational model wasperceived as more difficult to use.andP;  However, the difference was not largeenough to be of statistical significance.andP;  The reliability of the instumentused to measure perceived ease of use was 0.83.andM;Overall Interpretation of the ResultsandM;The overall objective of the study was to identify the better data model forend users engaged in conceptual representation task.andP;  The EER model scoredhigher in the correctness score of all facets except for unary relationship.andO;Given that the unary relationship is rarely encountered anyway, theoverwhelming evidence is in favor of the EER model.andP;  The most notable errorfound in the solutions prepared by the subjects was the incorrectrepresentation of connectivity of relationships.andP;  There wasno differencefound in perceived ease of use of the two models.andP;  Thus, the EER model wasfound to lead to better performance, but was not perceived as significantlyeasier to use than the relational model.andP;  One reason why a statisticallysignificant result for perceived ease of use was not obtained was the lowsample size (19 subjects) for this test as compared to the other tests of theexperiment (42 subjects).andP;  Further, because of the between-subjects design ofthe experiment, the subjects could not compare their perceptions of ease ofuse of the two data models.andM;IMPLICATIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCHandM;The general evidence from the study was that user performance in arepresentation task using the EER model, as compared to the relational model,was better.andP;  The EER model led to significantly better user performance inmodeling binary one-many, binary many-many and ternary one-many-manyrelationships.andP;  As the degree of the relationship increased from binary toternary, there was a sharp decline in user performance.andP;  The sharpdeterioration of user performance in modeling ternary relationships probablysets limits to the degree of relationships that can be successfully modeledby nonexpert end users.andM;Our study provides some clue about whether novice end users can developconceptual models if they understand the application.andP;  The performance of thesubjects in most facets, especially using the EER model, was satisfactoryenough to suggest that this is a real possibility.andP;  Some of the errors foundin the study would usually be caught as the database is defined via a DBMS.andO;A follow-up field study is needed to better understand what types of errorsor inadequacies are actually implemented by novice end users.andM;The results from the study also have practical significance.andP;  Currently, endusers are trained only to use DBMS software packages which are generallybased on the relational model.andP;  However, for effective use of such software,there is a need to train and support users in the discovery and validationtasks.andP;  Our research along with other findings [23] suggest that semanticmodels, e.g., the EER model, provide better mechanisms to support many ofthese tasks.andM;These findings have many implications.andP;  The developers of DBMS can build theinterface which is EER based, so that users can directly implement the EERrepresentation, without a conversion to the relational representation.andO;Alternatively, the novice end users can be trained to develop a conceptualmodel using the EER model which can then be converted automatically into arelational representation by utility software.andP;  Further, the developers ofDBMS can provide tutoring systems which assist the conceptual modelingprocess.andP;  Intelligent DBMS can be developed which can detect commonlyoccurring errors, and suggest corrections.andM;This study suggests that the most commonly occurring errors pertain to theconnectivity of relationships.andP;  This is especially the case with ternaryrelationships.andP;  Thus, the training of novice end users in the representationphase should focus on such frequently occurring errors, especially if suchusers may be expected to design nontrivial applications (that is,applications involving several entities and relationships between theseentities).andM;We suggest several extensions to our research.andP;  An obvious extension is tovalidate the research in a field setting.andP;  One can obtain actualimplementations of data-bases designed and implemented by end users, andcompare the errors found in these implementations with those found in thisstudy.andP;  Another extension of this research would be to compare expert andnonexpert designers.andP;  So that one could identify the nature of the expertisein this context.andP;  This would also provide useful information for buildingtutoring and expert systems to assist the conceptual modeling phase.andO;Finally, we need to consider the effect of other data models.andP;  other tasks,and other human characteristics on modeling performance.andM;APPENDIX A.andP;  EXERCISEandM;Projects Inc. is an engineering firm with approximately 500 employees.andP;  Adatabase is required to keep track of all employees, their skills, projectsassigned, and departments worked in.andP;
