Over the past20 years, the Japanese have developed their own construction and governmentregulatory institutions and now have an essentially independent domesticnuclear power program. Nuclear construction and government oversightof nuclear power have developed somewhat differently in Japan and theUnited States, reflecting to some extent the two countries' differentbusiness and social cultures. In the United States the vendor and utilityindustries are much more fragmented than those in Japan, and constructionprojects are carried out on a more competitive basis. The Japanese industryoperates through a few well-established consortia while the U.S. industrydoes not. Relations among the national government, the vendors, and theelectric utilities tend to be cooperative in Japan while they are moreadversarial in the Untied States. This paper discusses these topics ina framework of a comparative study of the countries' nuclear industries.Whether because of the factors mentioned above or for other reasons thesuccess of nuclear power in Japan and the United States has differeddramatically in recent years. This paper compares the performance ofthe nuclear enterprise in these two countries in terms of the physicalattributes of the plants themselves, the labor required to build them,and the construction times required. It also discusses the relationshipbetween initial estimates of costs and schedules and actual results achieved.On all counts, recent Japanese performance has been better than in theUnited States.</TEXT></DOC>
