In 1978, the first reportof application of diuretic renogram techniques to this problem appearedin the literature. This was the first systematic report of a standardizedprotocol to be applied to a specific surgical problem. The purpose ofthe procedure, as with perfusion pressure-flow studies, is to help distinguishbetween a dilated urinary tract that is obstructed and requires surgeryand a nonobstructed system in which urographic dilation and stasis mimicobstruction, but no genuine impedance to urine flow exists, and surgeryis not required. The technique provides dual information. It gives quantitativedata on individual renal function that perfusion pressure-flow studiesdo not, and it gives time-activity curves reflecting the urodynamicsthrough the individual upper urinary tracts at normal and high urinaryflow rates. In the early days, this information was obtained from probestudies, but the procedure is now almost exclusively performed usingthe gamma camera, images from which give additional information on thesite of any suspected obstruction. In some ways, the development of diureticrenography and that of perfusion pressure-flow studies have proceededin a competitive fashion, both attempting to answer the same questionsby different means. In practice, however, the two tests would be regardedas complementary, as will be shown later in this chapter. The followingsections describe the technique of diuretic renography, its current clinicalapplication and status in surgical and nuclear medicine practice, andits role in comparison with other available tests for management of thedilated upper urinary tract.</TEXT></DOC>
