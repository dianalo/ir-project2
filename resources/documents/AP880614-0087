But the Azerbaijani government voted to reject ceding control ofthe Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is predominantly Armenian.   Mofses Gorgisyan, an Armenian jailed in April and May forstaging nationalist demonstrations, said a general strike shut downmost businesses in Armenia on Monday, but that today ``some peopleare working, maybe half.''   He said students agitating for annexation had for three weeksstaged a sit-in outside the Opera Theater in Yerevan, capital ofthe southern republic.   Nagorno-Karabakh was assigned to Azerbaijan in 1923. MostAzerbaijanis are Moslems and most Armenians are Christians.   Azerbaijan's official Baku Radio reported today that theexecutive committee of that republic's legislature met Monday inthe Azerbaijani capital, Baku, and turned down a request byNagorno-Karabakh officials that their territory be transferred toArmenia.   The report, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. inLondon, said the Presidium of the republic's Supreme Soviet foundthe demand ``unacceptable'' because it would be ``contrary to theinterests of the Azerbaijani and Armenian population of therepublic and would be incompatible with the tasks of consolidatingthe friendship between all the peoples of our country, as well aswith the task of reconstruction.''   It said the annexation request came from the Nagorno-KarabakhAutonomous Region's Soviet of People's Deputies, one of twochambers of the region's legislature. A request from the same bodyin February touched off massive street demonstrations and strikesin Nagorno-Karabakh and Yerevan.   Armenia's legislature is to meet Wednesday to discuss theannexation demand.   Armenia's new Communist Party leader, Suren Arutyunyan, toldmore than 500,000 demonstrators in Yerevan on Monday that theArmenian Supreme Soviet would ``decide positively'' on their claim,according to Gorgisyan and Sergei Grigoryants, a dissidentjournalist in Moscow.   Gorgisyan quoted Arutyunyan as saying a majority of SupremeSoviet deputies indicated they support annexation. He said thespeech was replayed three times on Armenian television, apparentlyin an effort to persuade people to return to their jobs.   Since the Azerbaijani legislature has rejected the annexationdemand, if the Armenian Supreme Soviet calls for transfer ofNagorno-Karabakh, the issue would have to be decided by the centralgovernment in Moscow.   Moscow officials have rejected the demand once.   Gorgisyan said Armenians believe the next move is up to Moscow:``We are interested in Moscow's answer. Moscow has been silent sofar.''   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev got involved in the issue inFebruary, appealing to Armenians and Azerbaijanis to be calm andpromising the dispute would be reviewed.   The Kremlin later rejected the annexation demand and the centralgovernment instead approved a package of social and culturalimprovements for Nagorno-Karabakh.   According to Gorgisyan, three Armenians have been lying on thesquare outside the Opera Theater on a hunger strike since June 4.He estimated that 2,000 to 5,000 people were gathered on thesquare, where the latest round of demonstrations began May 25.   A worker at the Yerevan Hotel said the general strike was stillon and demonstrators were making speeches and holding posters.``It's very peaceful. People are highly cultured,'' said theworker. The phone conversation was cut off before a reporter couldask the woman's name.   The ethnic dispute has erupted into violence several times. Inlate February and early March 32 people, mostly Armenians, werekilled in riots in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait.   On Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov saidan Azerbaijani officer was killed by shotgun fire from an Armenianduring protests in Baku. He did not say precisely when the shootingoccurred.   There were unconfirmed reports Saturday of large-scale protestsin Baku.   Also Monday, the party leader of Azerbaijan, Abdul RahmanVezirov, told workers in Baku that they were correct in resistingArmenians' demands to give up Nagorno-Karabakh.   Communist Party authorities put Vezirov in charge of Azerbaijanand Arutyunyan in charge of Armenia on May 21, apparently firingtheir predecessors for not containing the dispute.</TEXT></DOC>
