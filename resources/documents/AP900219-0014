(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The patched-up tanker American Traderleft port Sunday for San Francisco, where it will undergo finalrepairs to a gashed hull that leaked 400,000 gallons of oil offSouthern California.   The ship left the Port of Long Beach at about 4:15 p.m., afterinspectors ruled it had been made seaworthy by temporary repairs,said Coast Guard Petty Officer Elizabeth Neely.   The trip up the coast was expected to take about two days, Ms.Neely said.   The oil spilled from the gashed hull Feb. 7, two miles offHuntington Beach, as the ship's crew maneuvered to unload thetanker's cargo of crude oil into a submerged pipeline. Authoritiessaid the tanker _ chartered by British Petroleum _ may havecollided with its own anchor.   Also Sunday, cleanup experts were trying to decide how to getrid of oil coating rock jetties between the Newport Beach pier andthe Santa Ana River, along the coast south of Los Angeles.   ``They're talking about using sea water heated to 85 degrees,which is warm enough to liquefy the petroleum on the rocks butwouldn't cook any creatures,'' said Newport fire Capt. RayPendleton.   About 300 cleanup workers were on the beaches between HuntingtonBeach and Laguna Beach, and their numbers may be reduced as theproject winds down, said Tony Kozlowski, a British Petroleumspokesman.   The spill forced closure of about 15 miles of beaches and twoharbors and economically hurt charter boat operators, whose craftare trapped inside the harbors.   The Coast Guard announced Sunday that Newport Harbor wouldreopen sometime Monday. Ms. Neely said conditions there improvedgreatly during the weekend.   Booms would remain in place at Newport Harbor, but ships couldpass through a gate that would be installed, she said.   There still was no timetable for opening the Anaheim Bay harbor.   As of Sunday, the oil had killed 300 birds and covered another461 birds in oil, state Fish and Game officials said. Two of foursea lions found soaked in oil have also died.</TEXT></DOC>
