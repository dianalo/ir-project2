LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A barrage of rockets hit a hospital, acrowded bus stop and an auto repair shop today in the capital,killing 21 people and injuring at least 22, the government andhospital sources said.   In Islamabad, Pakistan, a guerrilla radio official said oneguerrilla faction attacked a rival guerrilla group and killed 59people, mostly women and children. No date was given for theattack, which the purported attackers denied.   In Stockholm, Sweden, U.S. and Soviet delegations began two daysof talks on Afghanistan. It was the first superpower meeting on the10-year Afghan war since the last Soviet troops, who were alliedwith the Kabul government, left the country Feb. 15.   U.S.-backed guerrillas are fighting to overthrow theSoviet-backed Marxist government.   Some homes were also hit today in the shower of 14 rockets,Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said.   Amani said nine people were killed and 22 injured in separateattacks at Avicenna Hospital, its auto workshop and a nearby busstop. But hospital officials put the total killed in those threeattacks at 17 and said four other people died elsewhere.   The casualties raised to at least 200 the number of peoplekilled in rocket attacks on the capital this month.   Amani on Saturday accused the guerrillas of increasing rocketattacks on Kabul to ``have something in their hand'' for the startof U.S.-Soviet talks on Afghanistan in Stockholm today.   Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan this year under aU.N.-sponsored accord after a nine-year intervention to prop up thepro-Soviet regime.   In Islamabad, Qaribur Rehman Saeed, who runs therebel-controlled Afghan News Agency, said the Jamiat-e-Islamiguerrilla group attacked the village of Qochi Quba in the northernAfghan province of Kunduz. He said they killed four rival fieldcommanders as well as 55 women and children.   ``They surrounded the village and just began shooting with heavyartillery and missiles,'' he said. He gave no date for the attack,which could not be independently confirmed.   He said the slain field commanders were from the rivalHezb-e-Islami faction.   However, Mohammad Shaoib, a spokesman for Jamiat in thePakistani city of Peshawar, said, ``We think this is baseless. ...We haven't heard anything.''   Amani also said today that government troops ambushed an enemyammunition convoy southeast of Jalalabad, killing 75 guerrillas andinjuring 112. He gave no date for the attack.   In Stockholm, the U.S delegation was led by Assistant Secretaryof State John Kelly. The Soviet delegation was headed by AmbassadorNicolai Kozyrev.   An American official in Washington said the Soviet arms supplyto the ruling communists in Kabul will dominate discussions.   Officials in Stockholm said no issues other than Afghanistanwere on the agenda. However, Jim Borup, a U.S. Embassy spokesman,did not rule out the possibility that other issues might come up.   An American official in Washington said Friday the United Stateswould ask the Soviets for help in trying to win the release ofAmericans held hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems.   In Islamabad, the Afghan rebels' government-in-exile saidWashington should not make any agreements at the Stockholm talks.   Rasul Sayyaf, prime minister of the government-in-exile, said ina statement to the Afghan News Agency, ``Neither of the twosuperpowers can dictate their policies to us.''</TEXT></DOC>
