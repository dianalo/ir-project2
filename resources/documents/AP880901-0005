The coup talk was exemplified by an Aug. 17 article on theCerezo administration's economic austerity measures in thecountry's most widely read newspaper, Prensa Libre.   The article, headlined ``Cerezo's Cynical Ploy,'' quoted threeof five congressmen as using the word ``coup,'' hinting one wasaround the corner.   ``In our country we suffer from the continuous coup syndrome,''said Foreign Minister Alfonso Cabrera, referring to the successionof military dictatorships that has dominated Guatemala during itsmodern history.   Cerezo, a 46-year-old lawyer and Christian Democrat, took officein January 1986, heading the first elected civilian administrationin 16 years.   ``People here don't yet know how to live in democracy. Somebelieve that if they don't like a certain measure, the governmentshould be overthrown. Some small sectors still think like that,''Cabrera said.   On May 11, two columns of troops left their bases and marchedtoward the capital in an effort to seize power, but the attempt wasquashed without a shot. Six officers were arrested and four moredisciplined.   Cabrera said a few retired military officers and the NationalLiberation Movement, a small rightist party, were amongdestablizing elements. But he dismissed the threat they might pose.   ``There is no possibility of a coup,'' he said.   Defense Minister Gen. Hector Gramajo agreed. He said rightistelements in the agricultural and business sector mounted ``alarge-scale psychological (pro-coup) campaign'' after tax reform in1987.   ``All they could come up with was May 11. It was a good deal forus. We weeded out 10 less-than-brilliant officers. We discoveredand corrected vulnerabilities and were left with a greater capacityto confront such eventualities,'' he said.   ``The army is doing everything possible so that the era of coupspertains to the past. Nonetheless, the traditional forces are doingeverything possible so that it does not.   ``As of now, I'm winning,'' he said.   Guatemala's ``traditional forces'' are those that control landand business. Those sectors enjoyed a strong link with the armedforces during the decades of military rule.   Gramajo said the May coup bid ``was sponsored by a fascistagricultural sector of feudal characteristics.''   The National Agricultural Union groups the nation's principallandowners. Edgar Alvarado, its secretary-eneral, denied anyconnection with the May rebellion.   He said the government has had an incoherent economic policysince the tax reform, which was intended to increase governmentrevenues by making evasion more difficult.   The overhaul irked private-sector rightists, many of whomconsider taxation a form of socialism.   ``Private enterprise always tries to pay as little as possible,the state always tries to take as much as it can,'' said Alvarado.   ``We produce the hard currency. Others spend it,'' he said.Agricultural exports including coffee, cotton, bananas and cardamomaccount for about 85 percent of Guatemala's approximately $1billion in 1987 hard currency earnings.   Cerezo recently lifted price controls on basic foodstuffs andraised prices of fuel, public transport and utilitilities. Facedwith growing discontent over the effect on working people'spurchasing power, he slightly rolled back the fuel price increaseand decreed a 5-cent-per-hour wage raise for the private sector.   Private sector employees earn an average of about 50 cents anhour.   Alvarado said the president ``is pulling rabbits out of hats.... He has lost credibility. He tells each sector somethingdifferent.''   The private sector recognizes Cerezo's achievments during thefirst 18 months of his term. Inflation, which had been running atabout 35 percent, was brought down to about 10 percent. The grossnational product, which decreased by 6 percent in 1985, is expectedto grow by 3 percent to 4 percent this year.   Edgar Heinemann, head of the Chamber of Commerce and thebusiness federation CASIF, said, ``The government is going in tendirections at the same time. The Finance Ministry does one thing,the Economy Ministry another and the Central Bank another.''   He said that during the first six months of 1987, about $240million in private Guatemalan capital returned to the country tospur development. But the trend ended with tax reform, he said.   ``This year, there's capital flight,'' he said.   But he said differences over economic policy won't prompt localcapital to foster or fund a coup.   ``For us, the institutions are very important. A mistaken policydecision is something temporal. The country is forever,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
