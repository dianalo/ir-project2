But the new members of Parliament this decade are, alas, far from the standard English statesman Thomas Macaulay once saw in the Parliament of 1832: &quot;The most enlightened generation of the most enlightened people that ever existed.&quot; The new Tories are particularly weak on defense. In many ways, the government has only itself to blame. A prime minister who believes she &quot;can do business&quot; with the new Soviet leadership, together with a government that sees no redeeming feature in America's Strategic Defense Initiative but the contracts, is bound to invite such comments.    The tragedy of Thatcherism is not that some of the most radical members of Parliament for a generation have chosen to treat defense as they would Britain's nationalized health service, or education. It is that defense has simply failed to find a place on their agenda. This is all the more unfortunate since Thatcherism, if it means anything, means looking at every state subsidy in the light of what is affordable. A little monetarist efficiency might go a long way in the Ministry of Defense.    Unfortunately, the ministry has, therefore, by default become the territory of Whig tradition. Britain's Old Right has excluded from the ministries of defense and the foreign office those hard-faced men who captured commanding heights at the National Health Service. Three men who coveted the former -- Cecil Parkinson, Norman Tebbit and Nigel Lawson -- have been considered outsiders, whatever their influence at Number 10.    When defense problems aren't treated with Whiggish caution, they are subjected to a kind of narrow-minded Thatcherism, a penny-pinching without vision. John Nott did become minister of defense in 1981, but never gained the confidence of the Conservative Party's defense lobby. He was clearly a future Chancellor of the Exchequer, waiting in the wings for Sir Geoffrey Howe to retire. And his defense policy was dominated by a narrow economic view: The key word, he told the House of Commons in introducing the Defense Review of 1981, was &quot;volume,&quot; a measure which would have to be translated in the future into cash figures every 12 months. &quot;Last year,&quot; he reported, &quot;we suffered from severe cash problems and similar difficulties are already emerging in the current year.&quot; Of course, defense ministers and secretaries from every nation face strong constraints when it comes to department spending. But Mr. Nott's posture was particularly limiting. &quot;It was,&quot; his parliamentary private secretary at the time, John Wilkinson, wrote later, &quot;the bankers' approach; the company chairman preparing the shareholders . . . for news of a cut in the dividend.&quot; Mr. Nott ended his political life not as a victim of General Galtieri's Exocets in the Falklands War, but as a victim of Tory disdain.    At the Foreign Office there has been a complementary problem: a commitment to old verities, to arms control and detente as a way of saving money. When he was foreign secretary, Lord Carrington was described by one journalist as &quot;Whiggish, assiduous, intelligent . . . &quot; -- but above all pragmatic. Even the more acerbic Mr. Nott was described on his appointment to the Ministry of Defense by a Tory colleague as &quot;a nineteenth century liberal with a touch of rural sentimentality.&quot; That's a description which in any other ministry would have damned the man in Mrs. Thatcher's eyes overnight.    In Britain today, few institutions outside the government exist to check this backwardness. Mrs. Thatcher has created an important think tank, the Center for Policy Studies, but until recently it had no remit to discuss defense policy at all. Since policy adviser John O'Sullivan's departure from Downing Street, no one has worked on defense at Number 10. In a word, the prime minister has surrendered the defense community to the Whigs and the Whigs to a civil service community which has largely escaped the Thatcherite Cultural Revolution.    The reason for this, in part, is that defense has been a vote winner for Conservatives for so long that party conference organizers have been actively encouraged to minimize any disagreements within their ranks. Between 1945 and 1979 the Labor Party debated 70 resolutions on defense and threw out a third of those; the Conservative Party debated only 30 and accepted every one. It is a record which should be a matter for concern. During the party's 1986 Bournemouth conference, which met in the aftermath of the Reykjavik Summit, not a single speaker was prepared to challenge the notion that Britain's deterrent was safe in President Reagan's hands, despite the president's initial offer to eliminate all ballistic missiles.    Safely ensconced in the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defense, the traditional defense experts have largely inhibited the British government from pursuing some of the radical measures outlined in the Adam Smith Institute's Omega Report, a document with which neither the government nor the Conservative Party was formally associated. The report is the most fundamentalist Conservative document on defense yet published.    Denied expert advice, however, many of the reporters made recommendations that betrayed naivete. What the report proposed was the &quot;civilianization&quot; of the armed services: civil charter planes to replace strategic airlift command; reserves to replace regulars, women to support men in some roles. Pilot training in the Royal Air Force could be contracted out to the private sector; so could weapons maintenance in general. Civilian companies could be given state subsidies to strengthen or modify their cargo air fleet; merchant ships could be adapted to become aircraft carriers in time of war.    More than anything else, the crassness of some of the suggestions tells a sad story of energies wasted and talents misapplied. If the old party members, the &quot;Whigs,&quot; have offered remarkably little in the way of imaginative proposals to improve Britain's defense, the suggestions of the new men in the party have often merely invited derision. In an April Fool's Day jest, the Daily Telegraph newspaper imagined a Thatcherite military policy: It reported the government was considering de-nationalizing the army and selling off parts of it. &quot;Strict flotation terms,&quot; the paper wrote, &quot;would prevent hostile foreign interests gaining majority control. . . .&quot; It was a sad comment on Mrs. Thatcher's Britain that few apparently saw the joke.    ---   Mr. Coker is a lecturer in international relations at the London School of Economics.
