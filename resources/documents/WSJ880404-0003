The foreign exchange market has been rife with rumors that Japanese life insurers, who are a major force in currency trading, would step up their dollar-selling for hedging purposes after the old year ended. The companies normally sell dollars to hedge against possible foreign exchange losses when they buy dollar-denominated securities.    Traders speculate that insurance companies will have to reverse last month's build-up of their dollar holdings and increase their protection against a widely expected weakening of the dollar over the next few months.    Last month, according to traders, several insurance companies either stepped up their dollar-buying or put off selling dollars to help shore up the U.S. currency. Their aim was to avoid or minimize the foreign-exchange loss on a big chunk of their investment portfolios as the fiscal year ended.    In Tokyo, the Life Insurance Association of Japan issued a statement last week dismissing speculation that April would bring a torrent of dollar-selling by the industry. The statement called such speculation &quot;a wrong point of view, with no foundation.&quot;    According to the association, currency stability is indispensable to the insurance companies, which conduct a large share of their long-term fund management through investment in non-yen-denominated securities.    Excessive dollar-selling by the insurance companies would be like &quot;strangling yourself,&quot; an official at a major insurance company said in a briefing on the trade group's statement.    Kanji Kobayashi, director in charge of portfolio investment for Nippon Life Insurance Co., said traders who sold dollars recently on speculation that insurance companies will be big sellers this month have overlooked the fact that the companies also hold large amounts of listed securities. All foreign-exchange losses on these investments must be reported, in contrast to the companies' dollar-denominated securities, which don't have to be written down in value until the dollar declines 15% within a given period.    &quot;It's not in our interest to pressure the dollar lower excessively,&quot; Mr. Kobayashi said.    But Yasuhiro Kawate, chief trader at Industrial Bank of Japan's New York branch, still says Japanese life insurers will have to sell dollars this month.    Japanese insurance companies didn't seem to be a factor in the dollar's drop Friday, the first day of the fiscal year, Mr. Kawate said. He said the insurers are hoping for a dollar rally to sell into but would change their strategy in the event of a steep dollar decline.    &quot;If the dollar comes up, they'll sell into the market. If the dollar falls, they'll be forced to sell also. Either way, they have an interest in selling dollars this month,&quot; Mr. Kawate said.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar drifted lower in thin trading as the Good Friday holiday closed European markets and curbed U.S. activity.    &quot;There were relatively few banks operating Friday in New York, and those that were didn't do much trading,&quot; said Dan Brooks, head trader for BankAmerica International in New York.    In Tokyo trading, the Japanese central bank continued to support the dollar through intervention, as it had done throughout the week.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 123.85 yen, compared with 124.50 late Thursday. The dollar also slipped to 1.6555 West German marks from 1.6585.    Early Monday in Tokyo, the dollar slipped a bit further, trading at around 123.55 yen.    The Commodity Exchange in New York was closed Friday for the holiday.    ---               Late New York Trading               Friday, April 1, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
