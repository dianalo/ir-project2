While the plunging stock market has clobbered takeover stocks and speculators, it is fears of rising interest rates and a proposed tax bill that have dealt the merger business a staggering blow in recent days. Investment bankers, takeover lawyers and corporate raiders say that dozens of announced and unannounced takeovers are being reassessed.    Yesterday, the proposed $2.3 billion management buy-out of GAF Corp. was shelved for the moment. Wall Street executives say that others, such as a planned management buy-out of Southland Corp., are being delayed until the financial markets settle down.    The recent surge in interest rates and proposed tax law changes would hit at Wall Street's bread and butter: its ability to finance takeovers. The market for high-risk, high-yield &quot;junk bonds&quot; -- the backbone of many recent corporate takeovers -- is drying up as wary buyers wait to see where interest rates will settle. Few investment bankers are willing to make short-term &quot;bridge loans&quot; to finance takeovers in the current environment. And, of course, companies that use their stocks to buy other companies will find that plunging stock prices mean they have lost a lot of buying power.    &quot;Merger and acquisition activity is dead for the moment,&quot; said Harold Simmons, chairman of NL Industries Inc. and a noted takeover artist. Uncertainty over the tax bill and rising interest rates &quot;are going to knock a lot of deals out of the box,&quot; he added.    &quot;I don't expect to see people jumping into the market doing deals with the market down 500 points a day and bond prices dropping off, too,&quot; said Barry Friedberg, head of investment banking at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. He added that Merrill is holding up a number of mergers and acquisitions until markets settle.    Moreover, plunging prices for stocks considered takeover targets have devastated some arbitragers, traders say. Many of those who survive will sit on the fence at least for a while, making it harder for raiders to put companies &quot;in play.&quot;    How long the current paralysis will last is anyone's guess. If it persists, however, it could mean a slowdown in overall domestic merger activity. For some recent leveraged buy-outs, whose debt-repayment plans require major asset sales, this could mean trouble. And investment banks, which have reaped huge rewards from their merger and acquisition departments in recent years, could see their earnings dwindle.    But the news isn't bad for everyone. Takeover specialists say that falling stock prices could provide a feast for acquisition-hungry foreign buyers, who wouldn't be constrained by U.S. interest rates and tax laws. And, in fact, if stock prices fall further, some U.S. companies could again represent real bargains for investors and corporate raiders alike, even with higher interest rates.    The fall in stock prices &quot;is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity&quot; for takeover artists, said Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs, who said he's poring over balance sheets of prospective takeover candidates. Added New York investor Asher Edelman, &quot;I've been using this as a perfect buying opportunity since Friday.&quot;    Some takeover specialists and traders said yesterday's disclosure that a GAF management group led by Chairman Samuel J. Heyman is &quot;reconsidering&quot; its acquisition proposal for the company &quot;in light of current interest rates&quot; may be a sign of things to come. &quot;It's a harbinger of death,&quot; said one arbitrager. &quot;Now you have to look at every (takeover) deal.&quot;    Late yesterday, another proposed takeover fell through when Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific Tea Co. withdrew a $175 million offer for closely held Delchamps Inc., Mobile, Ala., citing in part &quot;current market conditions.&quot;    Meanwhile, an official close to the financing said Salomon Brothers Inc. and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. are delaying the completion of financing for the $4 billion leveraged buy-out of Dallas-based Southland. &quot;We're looking at market conditions,&quot; said one official involved in the financing. &quot;How long will it take? How long will it take for market conditions to settle down?&quot;    There was also speculation yesterday that the proposed sale of Beatrice may now be delayed until the market rebounds.    A spokesman for Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which owns Beatrice, declined to comment.    &quot;There are going to be deals crumbling,&quot; said Don Carter, a leading proxy solicitor. &quot;Nobody knows when rates will level off. That's the mystery that's causing a lot of deals to fall apart.&quot;    While other takeover professionals aren't so downbeat, almost all agree that conventional takeover financing is increasingly difficult to obtain in the current environment. Junk bond rates have risen sharply in recent weeks, making acquisitions based on that financial market far more costly.    &quot;Right now, it would be very difficult to do a high-yield (junk bond) deal,&quot; said Jack Perkowski, head of investment banking at PaineWebber Inc. &quot;All the money is being chased to the sidelines. But it can't sit there forever. People are just going to stand pat for a while.&quot;    Moreover, commercial banks are becoming more cautious about lending for acquisitions, because they fear that if interest rates continue to rise, and stock prices continue to tumble, current takeovers may be overpriced. &quot;Obviously, if you're going to raise money for a takeover, it helps to know what the rates will be,&quot; said Roland Franklin, an aide to Sir James Goldsmith, a major corporate raider. &quot;At this point, that's impossible,&quot; he added.    Moreover, under a proposed tax bill in Congress, takeover players would lose the ability to deduct most interest payments.    But some takeover specialists, while acknowledging that things are bad now, said that the halt in merger activity won't last for long. &quot;We're open for business as usual,&quot; said Joseph R. Perella, co-director of mergers and acquisitions at First Boston Corp. &quot;This is not a time to get weak at the knees.&quot;    Others dismissed the current uncertainty, in the words of takeover lawyer Joseph Flom, as &quot;a massive case of indigestion&quot; that will go away soon. Said Mr. Flom, &quot;I would be surprised if all this has any long-term consequences. It'll take a while for the blood-letting to be over, and then it's back to normal.&quot;    And when it gets to normal, some takeover players are betting things will be better than ever. Leonard Green, a partner of Gibbons Green van Amerongen Ltd., a leveraged buy-out concern, said of the stock market decline, &quot;It's like watching your mother-in-law go over the side of a cliff in your favorite car. You have mixed emotions about it.&quot;    Mr. Green said that while in the short term, takeover players could incur major losses, in the long term, stock prices will fall to &quot;realistic levels.&quot;    Takeover professionals largely discount the effect of falling stock prices on merger activity. If anything, it ought to provide more bargains, they say. Still, the precipitous decline of stock prices has drastically rearranged the circumstances of several current takeover battles.    For example, the Haft family's proposed $68-a-share bid for Dayton Hudson Corp. seems increasingly unrealistic, now that Dayton Hudson's stock price has declined from a high of $60.50 a share to $30 a share, including a drop of $14.75 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    Moreover, the Hafts, who own nearly 5% of the Minneapolis retailer's shares, have taken a paper loss of about $92 million on their stake, which they bought for roughly $50 a share. Sources close to the Hafts decline to comment on the family's proposed bid for Dayton Hudson, but say the family intends to push ahead with a planned proxy fight.    Another takeover player, Midland, Texas-based Wagner andamp; Brown, has an indicated paper loss of $65.6 million on its investment in USG Corp., which the partnership had said it might seek to control.    Not only are several takeover players in the unfamiliar position of losing money, but others are so leveraged that their losses may leave them on the sidelines for a while.    &quot;People who are in the market now could get wiped out,&quot; said Donald Trump, the real estate developer and takeover artist, who added that &quot;I haven't played the market for the last couple of months.&quot; Mr. Trump said that when the market settles, he doesn't think he will face as much competition for undervalued stocks from other corporate raiders who have held onto their stocks and suffered big paper losses.    But if Mr. Trump does get back into the market, some takeover specialists say he and others are likely to face steep competition from foreign concerns. &quot;Foreigners will have a heyday here,&quot; said Merrill Lynch's Mr. Friedberg. He said that unlike U.S. concerns, European, Japanese and Australian companies &quot;know what their tax situation is and have the benefit of cheap stocks in the U.S. and their own stronger currencies.&quot;    One of the only groups that may have been breathing a sigh of relief yesterday is corporate executives whose companies had been considered takeover targets in recent weeks. Some, said Mr. Simmons, &quot;will sleep a little better at night.&quot;    ---                  Largest Drops of DJIA Date                     Close       Decline      $ Chg.
