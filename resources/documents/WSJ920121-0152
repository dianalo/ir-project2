The plan, which will be added to the SEC's proxy-reformproposals in the next two months or so, would requirecompanies to use a specific method of valuing all stockoptions granted to senior officials. The program, beingpressed by SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, is designed to allowinvestors to compare executive pay plans from company tocompany.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, people familiar with the SEC say the agencyis considering allowing shareholders to vote on a broaderrange of proposals relating to executive pay.   Stock options have become one of the more integral waysfor executives to be paid but often are clouded by legal andfinancial jargon in the proxy statements sent toshareholders.   &quot;Sometimes under the current disclosure system, you needto be a Ph.D. in finance to determine the value of anexecutive's compensation package,&quot; Mr. Breeden said in aninterview. &quot;My sense is there really is a problem. This issomething that is relevant to analysts, directors andshareholders.&quot;   Executive pay has become a fiercely debated issue on theheels of President Bush's trip to Japan with U.S. corporateofficials. That trip highlighted the huge pay disparitiesbetween top executives in the two countries, despite thecompetitive troubles of many U.S. corporations.   While the SEC's action won't directly affect how much U.S.executives are paid, it could stir up shareholder sentimentabout compensation packages by putting hard numbers in frontof investors.   SEC officials feel it is outside their mandate to make anyeffort to cap executive pay.   But there are signs that the agency wants to allow moreshareholder votes on the issue. Last year, Linda Quinn, SECdirector of corporation finance, announced that shareholderswould be allowed to vote on changes to corporate bylawsdealing with compensation. Historically, the SEC had letcompanies leave those questions off the proxy ballot,agreeing with corporate officials that such issues relate tothe &quot;ordinary business&quot; of the company. Shareholdersshouldn't be able to determine whether an assembly lineworker is paid $5.50 or $5.80 an hour, the SEC said, soexecutive pay would be a logical extension of that.   But the agency moved away from that stance several yearsago when it began to let holders vote on &quot;golden parachute&quot;pay packages for top officers. Now, individuals familiar withthe process say, the agency is considering allowing morevotes on executive compensation questions -- not just thosethat change corporate bylaws.   For example, the SEC is weighing whether shareholdersshould vote on ending a company's plan to buy the homes oftop executives. &quot;How far the agency shoves the door open isstill to be determined,&quot; said one person with knowledge ofthe process.   Mr. Breeden declined to comment on plans other than theoption proposal, which he said is still being worked on byagency staffers. SEC economists will be studyingoptions-pricing models to determine which one best reflectsthe value of options and should be made the standard for allproxy statements.   Under current SEC rules, executive pay must be disclosedclearly in a table describing the cash and non-cashcompensation of the five highest-paid officials at a company.But in the non-cash category, &quot;it can be difficult tounderstand, and it can be very difficult to compare onecompensation plan with another,&quot; said Mr. Breeden. That ishurting investors' ability to compare companies, he added.   Last year, the SEC proposed a package of rules to make iteasier for shareholders to communicate with one another. Buta barrage of comment letters forced the agency to pull backthe proposals to clarify some of the wording. The optionsproposal would be added to the package when it is reproposed,&quot;hopefully before the end of the first quarter,&quot; Mr. Breedensaid.</TEXT></DOC>
