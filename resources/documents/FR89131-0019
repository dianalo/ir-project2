L. 100-418) (``the Act'') requires the President to impose, for aperiod of 3 years, a prohibition on the importation into the United Statesof all products produced by the Toshiba Machine Company (Toshiba), theKongsberg Trading Company (Kongsberg), and any other foreign person whomthe President finds to have knowingly facilitated the diversion of advancedmilling machinery and technology to the Soviet Union by Toshiba and Kongsberg.The President has issued Executive Order No. 12661, which announces theimposition of the sanctions required by section 2443(a)(2). These regulationsare being adopted to implement the Executive Order.Section 2443(a)(2) requires the President to prohibit the importation ofproducts produced by Toshiba and Kongsberg. However, in order to preventundue hardship to U.S. national security interests and minimize the collateralimpact of sanctions on U.S. companies, exemptions were provided for a widerange of transactions. The regulations implement the import prohibitionand provide necessary definitions and procedures whereby parties can importproducts exempted from the sanctions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>These interim regulations are effective immediately upon publication inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Such action is necessary to implement the sanctionsmade effective by the Executive Order. However, before adopting these interimregulations as a final rule, consideration will be given to any writtencomments (preferably in triplicate) timely submitted. Comments submittedwill be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedomof Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), andSection; 1.4, Treasury Department Regulations(31 CFR 1.4), and andSection; 103.11(b), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 103.11(b)),on normal business days between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. atthe Regulations and Disclosure Law Branch, Customs Service Headquarters,Room 2119, 1301 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20229.<ITAG tagnum="84">Inapplicability of Notice And Delayed Effective Date</ITAG>The effective date of the import sanctions imposed by Executive Order No.12261 is December 28, 1988. In order to implement the import sanctionsit is necessary that these regulations be effective on the date of publication.Accordingly, it is determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that noticeis impracticable. For the same reason, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3),it is determined to dispense with a delayed effective date. In addition,notice is not necessary since these regulations involve a foreign affairsfunction. However, before adopting final regulations, consideration willbe given to all written comments timely submitted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>Because this amendment involves a foreign affairs function, it is not subjectto E.O. 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for interim regulations,the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq.</T3>), do not apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This regulation is being issued without prior notice and public procedurepursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553).
