Negotiations recessed Saturday evening with an agreement thatboth sides would return to the bargaining table Wednesday.   Government-appointed mediator W.J. Usery, who had said he wantedto end the strike by Christmas, told both sides he expected tosettle the dispute by next Friday, according to sources familiarwith the talks. Because of a gag order imposed by Usery, thesources would talk only on the condition of anonymity.   A settlement by the end of next week would allow the Virginia,West Virginia and Kentucky miners to return to work after thetraditional holiday shutdown of mining operations.   Striking mine workers in Castlewood, Va., said they were notsurprised that contract talks were called off.   ``I wasn't expecting too much,'' said Bob Dixon, a UMW localpresident from St. Paul, Va. ``We did not want to get our hopes up,that way they don't get shot down.''   Miners pulling the late shift at the picket shack in McClure,Va., agreed with Dixon. ``It's kind of what I expected,'' said aminer who did not want to be identified. ``It was not realistic toexpect so much so soon.''   Usery, hoping to meet his goal, had the two sides at the tablevirtually around the clock all week, taking a break at midnightFriday but calling negotiators back to the table Saturday morning.   Considerable progress was made in the past few days but Userydecided to recess the bargaining until next week because it wasclear that an agreement could not be reached, drafted and approvedin time for the bargainers to make it home for Christmas.   The possibility of a settlement kept Labor Secretary ElizabethDole, who appointed Usery, in Washington _ delaying a trip sheplanned to North Carolina for Christmas.   The nearly 1,700 miners struck Pittston's coal subsidiary onApril 5, walking off the job at mines in Virginia, West Virginiaand Kentucky after working 14 months without a contract.   Wages never have been a major sticking point. Instead, thewalkout was prompted by Pittston's refusal to participate in anindustry agreement on how to fund costly miners retirement andhealth plans.   The talks are being closely followed throughout the coalindustry because of the implications a settlement might have onfuture discussions about the benefit plans.   The strike has been costly for both sides.   The union has paid the strikers about $200 a week in benefitsand is facing fines totallying $63.5 million for violating courtorders limiting picketing and other strike activities. Last weekthe union said it would give striker a $1,250 Christmas bonus.   Although Pittston hired replacement workers, production has beenwell below pre-strike levels. The company reported that its coaloperations lost $3.6 million in the second quarter of 1989 and $9.8million in the third quarter, compared to profits of $9 million and$7.4 million in the respective quarters of 1988.   The company has said special security requirements to protectreplacement workers and equipment has cost more than $10 million.   At times, the strike has turned violent.   Thousands of striking miners were arrested as a result ofdemonstrations in the early months of the strike. Several strikersalso have been arrested in connection with violence againstreplacement workers at some of the mines.</TEXT></DOC>
