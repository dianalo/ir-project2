And that has some lawyers worried.    They say the proliferation of such events is likely to bring closer scrutiny from regulators and investors. So they're warning entrepreneurs -- who make presentations at such events in the hopes of finding investors -- to be careful about what they say.    The problem, lawyers say, is that under certain circumstances, entrepreneurs could be charged by regulators with making an illegal offering of securities. Or they could face lawsuits from investors who get burned.    &quot;Anybody who is enticed into investing in a company which makes a presentation at a venture-capital club may have a right to rescind the transaction if the deal goes sour&quot; on the grounds that such a presentation was an illegal securities offering, says Joseph W. Bartlett, a venture-capital lawyer with Gaston andamp; Snow in New York.    The law, however, is murky on what exactly constitutes an illegal public offering. In fact, some lawyers at the American Bar Association's recent annual meeting in Toronto called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue guidelines on the subject. But the agency says such rules could cause more problems than they would solve -- by eliminating some legitimate forums if the rules are too strict or inviting abuses if they are too lenient.    &quot;At this point, we're loath to be any more specific,&quot; says an agency spokeswoman.    In lieu of such guidelines, lawyers and regulators offer this advice: Entrepreneurs should keep presentations general, avoiding specifics about capital needs or types of securities being offered. Also, venture groups shouldn't advertise meetings to the general public. &quot;That is obviously a general solicitation,&quot; says an SEC spokeswoman.    Women's Groups Look   Inside for Financing   WOMEN'S associations have long complained that a major obstacle for women entrepreneurs is the dearth of willing investors.    Now, some of them are determined to do something about it.    The National Association for Female Executives recently awarded $50,000 to one of its members to expand her Minneapolis manufacturing business. The 200,000-member association, which says about 17% of its members run their own businesses, plans to award up to $200,000 more this year through its new Venture Capital Program. In return, the association gets a stake in the company; profits will be used to expand the venture pool.    The National Association of Negro Business and Professional Women's Clubs is taking a different tack to help its 11,000 members start businesses. It just bought an American Speedy Printing Centers Inc. franchise in Washington, D.C. The store -- which is believed to be the first franchise owned by an association -- will &quot;serve as a role model and promote economic development,&quot; the association says.    The group plans to use some profits from the venture to help members fund the purchase of more American Speedy franchises. It will put up half of the money needed to buy a franchise in return for half-ownership.    Size Is in the Eye   Of the Government   WHEN IS A business a small business? The answer isn't as simple as it might seem.    To determine which companies qualify for certain government loans or contracts, the Small Business Administration defines &quot;small business&quot; differently for each of more than 850 industries.    For example, the government classifies bakeries or jewelry stores as &quot;small&quot; if they have revenue of less than $3.5 million. But for department stores or grocery stores, the cutoff is $13.5 million. Cigar-making companies are small if they have fewer than 500 employees. But cigarette makers can have up to twice as many employees and still be small.    &quot;There's no exact science in coming up with a size standard,&quot; concedes Gary M. Jackson, director of the Small Business Administration's size-standards staff.    Indeed, some businesses charge the government's definitions are arbitrary and unrealistic. Jesse E. Howard, who owns a Blacklick, Ohio, electrical-contracting concern, says the $7 million size standard for his industry should be about double that. Although his company qualifies as small now, he says any growth would cause him to lose that status and put him at a competitive disadvantage in bidding on government contracts. &quot;I'm at a standstill,&quot; he says.    Another problem is fraud. Critics of the government's &quot;set-aside&quot; programs for small business say some companies routinely set up &quot;shell&quot; corporations or just lie to qualify for government contracts. The SBA's Mr. Jackson admits there are abuses, but says, &quot;I don't think it's a major problem.&quot;    Odds and Ends   TANNING SALONS were started at a faster rate than any other business last year -- at least by one yardstick. The nation's Yellow Page telephone directories listed 17,405 tanning salons at the end of last year, up 55.3% from a year earlier, says the Omaha, Neb.-based Yellow Page Research Group. Retail toy and novelty shops and videotape rental stores also had growth rates of more than 50%. Perception vs. reality? When the general population is surveyed, 55% say that Michael Dukakis would do more for small businesses than George Bush, according to the latest poll by the National Federation of Independent Business. But small-business owners couldn't disagree more. They favor Vice President Bush over Gov. Dukakis by 78% to 17%, the NFIB says . . . For every small business that paid less taxes last year under the new tax code, eight paid more taxes, according to a poll by the Small Business Service Bureau Inc., a Worcester, Mass., small-business group. </TEXT></DOC>
