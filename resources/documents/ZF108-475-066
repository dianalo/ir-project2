(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Hildum, David.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>A language is developed that enables the easy and rapidspecification of a wide range of program transformations ofunstructured code for a variety of programming languages.andP;  Programtransformation systems are used to generate programs from formalspecifications or to modify code.andP;  The new specification languageidentifies the sequences of source code to be remapped in thetransformation, the new ordering of code and the actions to beperformed in the transformation process.andP;  Two syntax-directedtranslation processes recognize the transformation rules andgenerate their syntax trees, and employ the trees to generate thecode required for recognition of the patterns specified by thetransformation rules.andP;  The specification language was rapidlyprototyped in Prolog and successfully applied to a large number ofassembly- and source-level program transformations.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Research and DevelopmentCode ConversionTransformsCode GenerationLanguage TranslationProgramming LanguagesPattern MatchingNew Technique.andO;Feature:   illustrationtablechart.andO;Caption:   Pcode-like instruction set.
