It said the officer, Lt. Col. Yair Klein, fled Colombia but fourIsraeli associates ended up ``as hostages'' in his paramilitarytraining camp until a deal for their release was worked out.   Klein's lawyer, Yigal Shapira, denied the kidnapping report.   ``There is absolutely no truth to it,'' he said in a telephoneinterview. ``It's a nice story though.''   Defense Ministry spokesman Eitan Haber would not answer telephonecalls asking for comment.   The radio, which attributed its report to unidentified securitysources, said Klein earned about $800,000 for his work, includingproviding arms and equipment to the men he was training.   The government has begun investigating Klein's activities. Theradio report indicated the government has been aware for months ofKlein's operations.   Police investigators questioned two more reserve officers in thecase Tuesday and said others with possible links to Colombiantraining would be called. Interrogated were Avraham Tsadaka andMariot Shoshani.   Israeli newspapers said Tuesday that Israel was concerned thatreports of such involvement by Israeli mercenaries could hurt thecountry's lucrative arms trade.   The Miami Herald and also the Washington Post, quoting aconfidential report by Colombian security forces, reported that atleast five Israeli and 11 British mercenaries helped train teams ofassassins for Colombian cocaine traffickers and their right-wingallies.   Shapira repeated on Tuesday that neither Klein nor his firm, HodHahanit (Spearhead), sold weapons in Colombia. He would not commenton reports Klein was warned to leave that South American nation byIsraeli officials.   The Yediot Ahronot daily, in a report from Bogota, said Colombiahas purchased about $350 million worth of Galil rifles, Kfir fighterjets and communications equipment from Israel.   Police questioned Klein Monday on suspicion of violating Israelisecurity laws with his possible involvement in training killers forthe Medellin cartel.   Israel radio said that ``in the Defense Ministry, people knew.They asked the head of security in the Bogota Embassy to meet YairKlein and stop his activities. They are illegal and to get out ofthere and fast.''   It said Klein went to Bogota about six months ago to start atraining course and was warned by an Israeli official not to do sobecause the group being trained ``was in opposition to the(Colombian) government.''   Klein persisted, smuggling equipment and weapons to a camp about60 miles south of Bogota after paying a $100,000 bribe, the reportsaid, but he fled after a second warning saying Colombianauthorities wanted to arrest him.   After Klein left, apparently in April, Colombians at the trainingcamp reportedly held four of Klein's Israelis hostage, but freedthem after bribes were paid, the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
