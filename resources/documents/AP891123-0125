The renewed proposal by the leftist guerrillas for a negotiatedcease-fire was ``propaganda,'' the right-wing president told alarge gathering of reporters at military headquarters.   Shortly after the news conference began, suspected rebelsapparently tried to steal the show by setting off at least fivesmall bombs in a ravine about five blocks away. A military officersaid the explosives were ``guerrilla home-made bombs.''   The news conference continued as helicopters roared overhead,dropping bombs and rocketing the slopes of a volcano in apparentretaliation.   Cristiani, who was surprised but maintained his composure, saidthe Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front tried to spark apopular uprising to topple the government.   ``They tried it and lost,'' said Cristiani. He said the FMLN hadto ``come to its senses and stop its aggression against the people.Then we can sit down to look at the few things we can do tofacilitate their incorporation into the democratic process.''   Hopes that talks would begin under the auspices of VenezuelanPresident Carlos Andres Perez were dashed with the announcementthat only guerrilla officials would meet with Perez.   Cristiani said the guerrillas had used the peace process forpropaganda purposes while preparing the 11-day offensive that beganNov. 11.   The guerrillas had virtually the entire foreign press corps foran audience when they set the small bombs. Cristiani jumped, butkept talking, telling everyone ``not to worry.''   At one point he knocked over a chair as he reached for acigarette, and several times he mopped his brow. The conference washeld in an open-air pavillion at military headquarters, which hasbeen attacked numerous times during this nation's 10-year civil war.   The guerrillas had already proved their ability to launchattacks anywhere in the city, and Cristiani said ``anybody with asmall group of people'' could launch ``terrorism.''   Fighting Thursday flared in Apopa, eight miles north of thecapital. Soldiers were ambushed while buying soft drinks at aroadside stand but suffered no casualties. Dozens of governmenttroop-carrying helicopters came and went from an air base near thecity and the air force bombed a hillside near Apopa.   San Salvador's 1 million residents worked to clean up after therebel offensive and return the capital to some semblance ofnormality.   People lined up for gas, food and medical supplies. At theSoyapango cemetery east of the city, gravediggers buried fivebodies that had been left at the cemetery gates and said theyexpected more work.   Truck driver Israel Herrera stood in a line of 50 people at anatural gas distributorship in Soyapango, saying he ran out of thefuel a week ago.   ``We've been cooking with wood,'' he said. ``Since I don't haveany fuel for the truck I'm spending my days in line.''   Fighting in San Salvador ended Wednesday morning after 12 U.S.Army Green Berets left the Sheraton Hotel that had been seized byrebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.   The hotel is not now part of the U.S.-based chain.   On Wednesday night the FMLN renewed its cease-fire proposal butincluded language the government rejected earlier, saying acease-fire had to be ``defined.''   Rebel-government meetings in September and October foundered onthat point.   ``They have always tried to change what it means to have acease-fire,'' said Sandoval, who repeated the government positionthat any truce should begin at once, with details to be arrangedlater.   The rebels, who amended their proposal Thursday to say theywould ``cooperate'' in negotiating terms of a cease-fire, say thata cease-fire without terms works only for the government.   The guerrilla proposal also asked that the armed forces berepresented at the talks, another demand rejected previously. Therebels say the army holds the real power.   The guerrillas said they launched their offensive to persuadethe Cristiani government that they could not be defeated and wouldhave to be taken into account if the country was to have peace. The10-year-old insurrection has cost about 71,000 lives.</TEXT></DOC>
