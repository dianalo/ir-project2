The center-right Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Poul Schluetercommands only 67 of the 179 seats in parliament and needs to findshifting majorities to pass legislation. Moreover, the coalitioncomprising Schlueter's Conservatives, the Liberals and SocialLiberals shows signs of internal strife.   Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said the budget proposalreflected a major economic plan the government hopes to enact thisyear.   The plan, unveiled in May, called for a cut in the corporateincome tax rate from 50 percent to 35 percent, the top marginalincome tax from 68 percent to 52 percent and capital gains from 57percent to 40 percent.   It also proposed gradual reductions in public spending andemployment.   The tax reforms would be financed by introducing user charges forthe state's largely free social services and by shifting a greatershare of the unemployment benefit system onto employers and labororganizations.   The Social Democrats, Denmark's biggest political party with 55seats in parliament, put forward a tax reform of their own.   It also called for big tax cuts, but not at the expense ofwelfare benefits and employment. Instead, the Social Democratsproposed an obligatory pension savings plan, the proceeds of whichwould be reinvested in industry through union-run investment funds.   The government has begun negotiations with the Social Democratsto reach a compromise and avoid a showdown that could mean an earlyelection.   In a recent opinion poll published in the financial dailynewspaper Boersen, the Social Democrats and their allies, theSocialist People's Party, would have a slight majority if electionswere called now.   The ruling Conservatives did poorly both in the 1988 election andin a recent direct vote for the European Parliament. They face areal political test in local elections scheduled in November.   Danes have gone to the polls twice since 1987, but each time theresult was no clear majority in parliament.   In his proposal, Simonsen forecast total net state expendituresof $37.3 billion in 1990 with a budget deficit of $373.3 million.   The party's reaction to the budget, which included a $1.06billion cut in public spending, was to reject it unless thegovernment dropped the proposed welfare cuts.   But Schlueter demanded the Social Democrats accept the budget asa condition for the government's continuing to bargain with theopposition on tax and economic reforms.   Parliament will vote on the budget in December, and thegovernment hopes to have made a deal with the Social Democrats bythen. Otherwise, Schlueter might be forced to seek support from therightist Progress Party and other minor non-socialist parties or tocall an election that he likely would lose.</TEXT></DOC>
