About 500 policemen lined the streets in Noumea, but no violencewas reported during the five-hour march and rally.   About 7,000 French police and military personnel remained onfull alert Saturday, although the Kanak Socialist NationalLiberation Front, the main separatist group, said it would notdisrupt voting Sunday in the French presidential runoff.   The first round of voting April 24 was marked by shooting, theerection of barricades and threats of violence that kept somepolling stations closed.   During that election, voters also chose a local territorialcouncil which the separatists oppose. The council is part of anadministrative plan for the archipelego set up by conservativePremier Jacques Chirac, who received 74.6 percent of theterritory's first-round vote.   Extreme right National Front candidate Jean-Marie Le Penreceived 12.3 percent of the vote. Socialist President FrancoisMitterrand, who Chirac faces in Sunday's runoff, garnered 4.9percent of the vote.   Two days before ballotting, Melanesian separatists stormed apolice station on the island of Ouvea, northeast of New Caledonia'smain island, killing four gendarmes and abducting 27 others.   Twelve hostages were later released, but on April 27, eightlawmen were seized while they attempted to negotiate for therelease of the other hostages, held in a cave on the north coast ofOuvea.   On Thursday, police stormed the cave and freed the hostages,killing 19 of the kidnappers. Two members of the assualt team alsodied. Five people were injured.   In Paris, 57 gendarmes arrived on a commercial flight from NewCaledonia on Saturday and were greeted by Defense Minister AndreGiraud. Among the gendarmes were 10 who had been injuried in thelatest wave of violence that began April 22.   The gendarmes preceded Bernard Pons, minister for overseasterritories, who left Noumea for Paris on Saturday, saying hismission had been completed with the freeing of the hostages.   ``If I am sad because there were some dead, I also say thatthose who attack someone, who attack a bank, who commit a terroristact, take some risks and should be ready to assume them,'' Ponstold reporters before leaving.   Yeiwene Yeiwene, second-ranking leader of the liberationmovement, accused France of choosing blood over mediation.   ``The nationalist Kanaks never wanted to kill the hostages. Theyhad all the means, they had all the time to do so had they wished.But there were no hostages killed,'' Yeiwene said in an interviewon Radio Djiido. ``The massacre was perpetrated deliberately by Mr.Pons, who knew ... that there was no question of killing thehostages.''   Speaking to separatists at the rally, liberation front spokesmanLeopold Joredie, said ``It it because the Kanak people have beencornered that some of our sons chose the action on Ouvea.''   Joredie said reports from separatists on Ouvea indicated thatsome of the kidnappers were hunted down and killed after the attackat the cave.   A French armed forces spokesman denied the allegation.   French authorities have promised that the 27 people arrested inconnection with the Ouvea kidnapping would remain in the territoryfor trial. Since April 22, 49 people have been arrested for acts ofseparatist violence in the territory.   Native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 36 percent of the145,000 inhabitants of the territory. Forty-three percent areEuropean settlers, with the rest of the population made up ofAsians and Polynesians.   New Caledonia was colonized by France in 1853.</TEXT></DOC>
