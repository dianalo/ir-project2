Stevens, aDean Witter analyst. &quot;It's the worst I've seen it in all ofthe years I've been following the industry.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The largest companies were particularly hard hit.International Business Machines Corp. is expected to report abig loss, after a $3 billion pretax charge, and its firstyear-over-year revenue decline since 1946. Digital EquipmentCorp., the nation's second-largest computer maker, willreport the first operating loss in its history.   IBM says it will take the $3 billion charge to pay thecost of cutting its work force by another 20,000 people thisyear -- after cutting about that many in 1991 -- and asweeping reorganization.   Uncertainty over the net effect of the charge has resultedin widely varying fourth-quarter forecasts. Salomon Bros.analyst Steven Milunovich expects IBM, Armonk, N.Y., toreport a $771 million net loss, or $1.35 a share, on a 2%revenue decline to $22.5 billion. Mr. Stevens of Dean Witteris more optimistic with a net loss of $31 million, or fivecents a share, but he sees a 3.3% revenue decline, to $22.3billion. In the 1990 fourth quarter, net income was $2.461billion, or $4.30 a share, on revenue of $23.061 billion.   But most analysts are focusing on IBM's operating results,where there is less uncertainty. Mr. Milunovich isforecasting a profit before the charges of $1.5 billion, or$2.70 a share, while Mr. Stevens sees operating profit of$1.469 billion, or $2.57 a share.   Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., attributes the expectedloss for its second fiscal quarter to the weakening worldeconomy, especially in Europe, and to a broad transition to anew generation of computers that weren't available in thefourth quarter. Analysts see a net loss for the periodranging from $75 million to $125 million, or 50 cents to $1 ashare, compared with yearago net of $111.1 million, or 92cents a share.   Revenue is expected to slip to between $3.2 billion and$3.3 billion, from $3.35 billion a year ago. Marc G. Schulmanof UBS Securities Inc. says the decline will come fromproduct sales, which will be about 2.5% lower than in theSeptember quarter. Service revenue, on the other hand, hascontinued rising, but not enough to offset the decline incomputer and software sales. Mr. Schulman, who is convincedthat Digital hit bottom in December and will start to reboundby March, has a &quot;buy&quot; recommendation on the stock.   Unisys Corp., Blue Bell, Pa., should report its firstprofit in two years in the fourth quarter. Thanks largely tocost reductions related to a $1.2 billion restructuringcharge earlier this year, analysts expect Unisys to report aprofit for the quarter of about $24 million, or 15 cents ashare, despite sharply lower revenue estimated between $2.67billion and $2.34 billion. In the 1990 quarter, its net losswas $119 million, or 74 cents a share, on revenue of $2.933billion.   In Silicon Valley, Hewlett-Packard Co. is expected toreport essentially flat results for its fiscal first quarterending Jan. 31. Shao Wang, of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp;Co., forecast net income of $208 million, or 83 cents ashare, on $3.7 billion in revenue. Last year the Palo Alto,Calif., computer and instrument maker had net income of $205million, or 83 cents, on $3.4 billion in revenue.   Even some personal computer makers will report weakresults, as intense price competition and sluggish sales haveslashed profit margins in the industry.   Compaq Computer Corp. may be the biggest casualty. MicheleS. Preston of Cowen andamp; Co. expects net income of $40.3million, or 45 cents a share, on sharply lower revenue of$800 million. Marianne Wolk of Oppenheimer andamp; Co. is a littlemore optimistic, forecasting per-share net of 55 cents -- andsome estimates range as high as 75 cents, based on favorablecurrency translations in the quarter and notebook computersales. In the 1990 fourth quarter, the Houston firm earned$134.8 million, or $1.51 a share, on sales of $1 billion.   Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif., should be a brightspot in the stagnating desktop market, Ms. Preston says. Sheprojects net income of $128 million, or $1.04 a share, onsharply higher revenue of $1.877 billion. In the year-agoperiod, Apple reported net income of $150.5 million, or $1.28a share, on revenue of $1.676 billion.   Stratus Computer Inc. has also enjoyed revenue growth.Analysts expect the Marlborough, Mass., maker offault-tolerant computers will report net income of about$16.4 million, or 73 cents a share, on an 8% revenue hike to$128 million. Net income in the 1990 period was $13.46million, or 64 cents a share, on revenue of $118.5 million.   In workstations, market leader Sun Microsystems Inc.should earn between $43 million and $49 million, or 42 centsand 48 cents a share, on $860 million to $875 million inrevenue for the second fiscal quarter ended Dec. 28, saysRobert G. Herwick of Hambrecht andamp; Quist Inc. But Mr. Herwickworries about the coming year, with Sun facing unexpectedlystrong competition in the critical under-$10,000 marketsegment from IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Digital and SiliconGraphics Inc.   In the year-ago second quarter, Sun, based in MountainView, Calif., had net of $39.1 million, or 39 cents, onrevenue of $753.5 million.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES Corp. expects to report aloss in the fourth quarter and Digital Equipment Corp.expects to report a loss in its fiscal second quarter endedDec. 28. A headline in Friday's edition incorrectly statedthat IBM and Digital expect full-year losses.   (WSJ Jan. 13, 1992)</TEXT></DOC>
