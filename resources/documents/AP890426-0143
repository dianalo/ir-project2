Another official said a group of traders was ambushed as itreturned to the Thai district from Cambodia. ``While many of themwere running away from the gunfire, they found they were in themiddle of a minefield. They got blown up by the mines,'' he said.   The officials said 37 of the wounded were hurt seriously.   ``We have truckloads of wounded and we haven't seen the endyet,'' said Urs Boegli, head of the Red Cross delegation inThailand. The injured were taken to a hospital at the Khao-I-Dangrefugee camp run by the International Committee of the Red Cross.Boegli said the Red Cross recalled a third surgical team for thecrisis and had blood brought up from Bangkok.   Officials said the casualties included Thais, but most wereCambodians living on the other side of the border.   It was one of the most serious clashes along the border sincethe devastating 1984-85 Vietnamese offensive on the Cambodianresistance camps.   Other details were not available.   Ta Phraya district is in the eastern border province ofPrachinburi and about 50 miles north of the key Thai border town ofAranyaprathet.   Black market trading and clashes over it are rife along theborder and involve Thais as well as Cambodian guerrillas andrefugees in guerrilla-run camps. Three Cambodian guerrilla groupsbased along the frontier are fighting Vietnamese forces and troopsof the government Vietnam installed there after invading thecountry 10 years ago.   Also Wednesday, gunners continued recent attacks on Cambodianrefugee camps just inside Thailand, hitting the Site 2 camp withheavy shells that seriously injured four refugees, a Westernofficial said.   Site 2 is along the border in Prachinburi province and with180,000 people it is the largest U.N.-aided Cambodian refugee campin Thailand.   It was not clear who fired the shells, which forced theevacuation of all but the most essential Western aid workers. Thecamp is controlled by guerrillas of the Khmer People's NationalLiberation Front.   In the past, shellings of the camps escalated as the two sidesmaneuvered in advance of diplomatic events.   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk is to holdtalks in Indonesia next week with Hun Sen, premier of thepro-Vietnamese government.</TEXT></DOC>
