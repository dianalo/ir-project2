However, it sometimes happens thatthis substance changes its phase if it reacts long time with molten carbonate.Especially when transformed into alpha-phase, its specific surface arealowers considerably reducing the holding property of the electrolyte.In this invention, power of lithium-modified partially stabilized zirconiawas mixed with alkali carbonate powder, and the mixture was molded toobtain an electrolyte matrix which could maintain high power-generatingcharacteristics for a long time. A compound obtained from Y{sub 2}O{sub3}-partially-stabilized ZrO{sub 2} by treating with lithium is expressedby Li{sub 2}(Y/sub/Z/Zr/sub/1-x/)O{sub 3} which well maintains its compositionfor a long time with extremely little degradation. ZrO{sub 2} which ispartially stabilized with CaO can be similarly used. (1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
