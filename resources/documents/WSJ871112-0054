Mr. Regan will deliver a 90-second radio commentary each weekday on politics, economics and other subjects in the news. The broadcasts will appear on the NBC Radio Network as &quot;The Donald Regan Report&quot; starting Dec. 1.    The former U.S. Treasury secretary and chairman of Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. hinted that he may stir the pot a bit. &quot;I'm looking forward to expressing my views, contrary as they may be to those generally accepted,&quot; he said in a prepared statement.    Westwood One Inc., a Los Angeles-based entertainment concern, recently bought National Broadcasting Corp.'s radio network operations from General Electric Co. and hired Mr. Regan for the broadcasts. </TEXT></DOC>
