Mr. Callner makes rock videos, a product in such demand that he finds himself working 20-hour days at times. &quot;It's a madhouse,&quot; he says. &quot;I've never been busier in my entire life.&quot;    Mr. Callner's hectic schedule is being matched by others who make a living from recorded music. Stuck in a coma not long ago, the renascent music industry seems headed for its biggest year ever in 1987, likely exceeding the all-time high of $4.65 billion that the Recording Industry Association of America estimates was grossed at domestic stores last year.    With rare exception, &quot;everybody in the record business is making tons of money,&quot; says David Geffen, who owns Geffen Records, one of the largest independents.    But there are signs that the elevator has reached the penthouse. The compact disk craze, which has fueled the current boom, may be peaking. The U.S. market isn't as young as it used to be. And technological improvements could spark a new home-recording boom. Those factors and others could mean it's time for record companies to take the money and run.    The industry leader, CBS Inc., is facing such a decision and its board is scheduled to meet today on the issue. It's the best of times at its records unit, probably the world's largest, which has new recordings by superstars Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen in stores simultaneously. Yet CBS is now considering selling its records business to Sony Corp. of Japan, which has offered an eye-popping bid rumored to approach $2 billion, or spinning the unit off. The Sony offer is extraordinary given that a previous bid from a group led by the unit's president, rejected less than a year ago, was just $1.25 billion.    What's more, whether CBS sells to Sony could determine the future of a new, Japanese laser-based recording technology that uses tape instead of disks. It would allow flawless home copying -- and it has U.S. record companies up in arms. CBS is at the forefront of the opposition.    The prospect of CBS selling while business is so strong has stunned some record industry insiders. And CBS isn't the only company in a position to cash in on what may be an industry peak. N.V. Philips said recently it will sell 20% of its PolyGram records division in a stock offering that could bring as much as $270 million, implying an overall value of $1.35 billion for Polygram.    The music business is notoriously cyclical. Just a few years ago, it was mired in a deep slump. Younger consumers spent their money on video games, and music executives wondered if aging baby-boomers would keep buying records once they got past 30. Home taping was considered a scourge.    Video games have faded, but the industry was really resuscitated by compact disks, introduced about four years ago. The CDs allow higher profit margins and prompted a spending spree by audiophiles seeking to upgrade their collections. Last year some $930 million of CDs were sold in U.S. stores, rivaling albums in dollar volume.    The business may be even healthier overseas, where CDs have only begun to take hold. PolyGram estimates the non-U.S. market for recorded music at about $10 billion this year, and projects 1987 unit sales growth of 5% world-wide.    &quot;The record business is going through a really healthy time,&quot; says PolyGram records president David Fine, adding that the rapidly industrializing Far East and possible reforms in the communist world promise expanding markets and even faster growth ahead.    Such considerations sound like good arguments for staying in the record business, but they mask some worrisome signs. For example, revenue and profits are up, yet domestic unit sales fell last year, as they did the year before, mainly because of the decline in long-playing albums.    If inflation is factored into domestic sales, the industry is still behind where it was in 1978, when an estimated $4.13 billion was grossed -- before there were any CDs.    Moreover, sales growth in CD players has slowed, suggesting the boom may be maturing, and the phenomenal success of videocassette recorders has intensified competition for consumers' leisure time. Some 45% of U.S. households now have VCRs, but just 7% have CD players.    The demographic facts are scary too. The U.S. population as a whole is aging, and the current generation of teeny-boppers is fewer in number than the crop 20 years ago.    &quot;That doesn't bode well for the industry,&quot; warns Irving Azoff, president of MCA Inc.'s music division.    CBS itself illustrates the cyclical nature of the business. Profits for its record segment were $162.1 million last year, against $87.2 million in 1985, $123.5 million in 1984, $109.4 million in 1983 and $22.2 million in 1982.    Against the recent past, the music business is at a peak, another potential argument for CBS to sell. Industry observers are predicting a banner year, spurred in part by a line-up of releases by big-name stars for the year's crucial final months.    The new Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen albums are already out, and new releases are either out or due from Mick Jagger, Elton John, Billy Idol, Van Morrison, Kiss, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Bananarama, and The Judds among others.    One of the biggest question marks in the music business has to do with the digital audio tape technology, which, ironically, is much like the CD systems that have been its salvation. The new technology combines CD-quality sound with the ability to record and erase. There is talk of DAT players arriving here from Japan early next year.    &quot;It's a naked attempt by the hardware manufacturers to milk the software manufacturers one more time,&quot; says Alvin Teller, president of the domestic records division of CBS. Adds M. Richard Asher, president of PolyGram's U.S. records unit, &quot;DAT has no virtue except for the fact that it copies better.&quot;    DAT proponents scoff, but Mr. Geffen predicts that neither CBS nor Warner will sell pre-recorded music on DAT unless the players contain anti-copying devices. Without music, he says, DAT will wither.    Whether Sony, which could make a fortune producing DAT machines, succeeds in acquiring CBS Records could determine whether DAT has any future. Some say Sony would use the acquisition to sweep aside DAT opposition, but others say it might be unwilling to jeopardize a $2 billion investment by selling DAT machines without anti-copying devices. A CBS spokesman won't discuss the subject, except to underscore the company's opposition to DAT.    If the music business does enter another downturn, it will probably be better equipped to deal with it than before. There are only six main distribution companies left (compared with twice that number in the 1960s) and at least some of the lavish spending for which the industry was famous has been cut away.    John Carsello, studio manager at Rumbo Recorders, an independent sound facility in Canoga Park, Calif., says recording artists no longer routinely stretch sessions into the wee hours, running up huge studio charges.    &quot;They're much more cost-conscious,&quot; agrees vice president Joseph Henriques of Music Express Inc., which provides limousine services to most of the major record companies. He complains that industry economizing has forced him to use sedans instead of stretch limousines in many cases.    That doesn't mean the music business has grown staid. In Los Angeles, Porsche and Mercedes cars abound throughout the entertainment field, and people in the record business are often particularly freewheeling. Mr. Azoff and his high-spirited aides drive fancy cars, go without neckties, and throw dinner rolls in restaurants -- all despite the strait-laced culture that otherwise prevails at MCA.    MCA has benefited in the current boom, but CBS appears to be the biggest gainer of all: the company's records division is likely to have a big last quarter, on top of a strong nine months and 1986.    PolyGram has also seen an upturn recently. But Mr. Asher recalls that before he joined the company, which consists only of the U.S. record business, it was about to be sold -- at fire-sale prices. PolyGram is now profitable in the U.S., but Pam Haslam, vice president for communications, knows that in the platter business, what goes around comes around.    &quot;In 18 months they'll be cutting back on messenger service and overnight delivery,&quot; she says stoically. &quot;Meanwhile it's going great.&quot;    ---   Records: Growing Again ...
