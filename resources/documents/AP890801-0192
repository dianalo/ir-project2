The storm was blamed for the death of a man who fell from aChevron oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico south of New Orleans. Noinjuries were reported in Texas.   Thirteen people, including 10 on Tuesday, were plucked fromcapsized fishing vessels in the stormy Gulf of Mexico by CoastGuard helicopter crews. The Coast Guard also sent a patrol boat anda jet into the storm Tuesday to take water pumps to two shrimpboats in trouble.   Up to 15 inches of rain was forecast for parts of eastern Texas,where many areas remained saturated from Tropical Storm Allison sixweeks ago. Meteorologists said that with rivers and creeks stillhigh from the earlier heavy rain, residents in low flood-proneareas should begin taking precautions.   The hurricane's sustained wind speed never exceeded 80 mph anddecreased to 75 mph as it moved inland.   About three hours after the storm made landfall at 8 a.m. CDTTuesday at High Island, it had weakened further and was downgradedto a tropical storm. By Tuesday night the storm had been downgradedto a tropical depression and all warnings had been discontinued.   But it continued to be a major rainmaker and tornado threat,although there were no immediate reports of tornadoes.   At 8 p.m. CDT, the center of the storm was located near latitude30.8 north and longitude 96.4 west, or just north of CollegeStation, Texas. Maximum sustained winds had decreased to 30 mph.Also Tuesday, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center inFlorida were tracking Tropical Storm Dean, which carried top windsof 50 mph as it churned across the open Atlantic but was not yetconsidered a threat to land.   In Louisiana, flash flood and tornado threats lingered, but morethan 11,000 coastal residents headed back to their homes, unscathedby their brush with Chantal. Several beachfront homes in Grand Islewere destroyed, but officials said the small town had missed theworst.   About 20 miles off the coast, divers returned to anothercapsized Chevron oil rig to search for 10 missing crewmen despite10-foot seas and 43 mph winds left behind by the hurricane.   The rig, leased from Avis Bourg Co. of Folsom, had left theworksite because of the threat of Chantal and capsized on the way.   The Agriculture Department of Mexico said Tuesday that heavyrains brought on by Chantal helped put out fires in the YucatanPeninsula that have ravaged up to 370,000 acres of jungle duringthe past two months.   Tides at Galveston, Texas, were reported near normal within twohours of Chantal's landfall.   The Johnson Space Center was closed when the nearby Clear Lakearea recorded more than 10 inches of rain Tuesday.   A Galveston shelter housed some 1,000 people for the night, butit was closed by midday as the worst of the storm passed. Sheltersin Port Arthur and Beaumont were vacant by mid-morning after onlyabout an inch of rain fell.   About 30 people spent the night at the high school in HighIsland, a lightly populated fishing and resort community midwaybetween Port Arthur and Galveston.   ``My house started to move and it's not a mobile home,'' saidJim Chaney, of nearby Crystal Beach. ``That's about the time wedecided we should be moving along.''   ``We were real lucky,'' added Donny Jones, who lives near HighIsland. His home suffered minor damage when a 60-year-old pecantree blew over.   In Houston, 40 mph wind caused downtown skyscrapers to sway andcreak, but no damage was reported.   Roofs were blown off a few houses and some utility poles wereblown down along the coast.   At High Island, barrels rolled along roads and the metal roof ofa Veterans of Foreign Wars hall was shredded. Residents lost poweralthough the few businesses in town remained open.   ``We get worse thunderstorms than this,'' said Betty Barrow, a28-year resident of High Island. ``People are always casual aboutthese things here. The old-timers don't worry about these things;they just stay.''   Lyndon Young of Gilcrest found his house on stilts in good shapewith only minor roof damage, although it was surrounded by water.   ``By hurricane standards, so far this is pretty minor. If I getthrough this without losing my appliances and lawn mower and thosekinds of things, I'll be lucky.''   Side roads on the Bolivar Peninsula, east of Galveston, remainedunder water and people gathered at high spots to wait for the waterto recede.   ``It's one of the hazards of living down here,'' said HarryLeJune, who has a mobile home hear the beach. ``But I love it downhere because it's peaceful, quiet, small communities and everybodyknows everybody. If you live on the beach every once in a while yousort of expect to get flooded out.''</TEXT></DOC>
