(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA postponed the start of thecountdown for space shuttle Discovery by eight hours Sunday becauseof lagging preparations, but still aimed for a Thursday morningliftoff.   ``We're still on the timeline for launch on the 29th and that'sthe plan,'' said launch director Bob Sieck.   The countdown was rescheduled to begin at 8 a.m. EDT Monday forthe first manned American space flight since the Challenger blew upover the Atlantic 32 months ago.   The space agency had added 27 unprogrammed hours to thecountdown as insurance for last-minute problems, and Sieck saideight hours of that time would be used in advance to complete thework of replacing panels and work platforms.</TEXT><DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   June Scobee says she will watch the liftoff ofDiscovery on television because her presence at the launch site``would just remind everyone'' of the shuttle disaster that killedher husband and six other crew members.   Mrs. Scobee has not been back to Cape Canaveral, Fla., sincethat chilly morning of Jan. 28, 1986, when the Challenger exploded73 seconds after launch.   Now Mrs. Scobee, whose husband, Dick, commanded the ill-fatedship, said that ``like any other American citizen'' she is eagerfor a successful Discovery mission to get NASA's manned spaceflightprogram back on track.   None of the other Challenger families will attend Thursday'slaunch from the Kennedy Space Center, and Mrs. Scobee said somehave not even decided whether they will watch on TV.</TEXT><DATELINE>PLAINS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Billy Carter, the former ``first brother''and beer-drinking good ol' boy whose candor and business venturesamused and sometimes embarrassed the Carter administration, diedSunday of cancer. He was 51.   The brother of former President Jimmy Carter suffered for a yearwith pancreatic cancer _ the disease that killed his father and asister _ and lived longer than his doctors expected. He died threedays after leaving the hospital for his home in this southwestGeorgia hamlet.   Carter ``died quietly and peacefully in his sleep ... with hisfamily at his bedside,'' according to a statement issued by theCarter Presidential Center on behalf of the former president andhis family.   ``He had struggled courageously with his illness, never losinghis sense of humor and always more concerned about those who lovedhim than about himself,'' the family said.</TEXT><DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Emperor Hirohito lay in serious condition Sundaybut was alert enough to watch the finals of the autumn sumotournament on television, and a daughter who paid a bedside visitexpressed optimism about his health.   Thousands of well-wishers braved thunderstorms and cold rain tothrong the gates of the moated Imperial Palace in central Tokyounder a sea of bright umbrellas. Palace officials say 300,000 havesigned their names in a dozen registries set up nationwide to prayfor Hirohito's recovery.   The 87-year-old monarch remained under intensive,round-the-clock care by a team of court doctors after vomitingblood from an intestinal hemorrhage on Monday. The emperor has saton Japan's Chrysanthemum Throne for nearly 62 years.</TEXT><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The dream of creating room-temperaturesuperconductors is impossible unless scientists come up withmaterials different from those they are now developing, new studiessuggest.   Superconductors transmit electricity without resistance. Variouscopper oxides are now the best superconductors under developmentbut have so far worked only if chilled to at least 234 degreesbelow zero Fahrenheit.   Commercially available superconductors must be kept much colderwith liquid helium, an expensive and cumbersome process.   Researchers believe that if they can create room-temperaturesuperconductors, it may be feasible to build faster, smallercomputers; cheaper, super-efficient power transmission lines; 300mph trains that float above tracks, and extraordinarily powerfulmagnets to help produce electricity from nuclear fusion.</TEXT><DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rev. Barbara C. Harris, elected thefirst woman bishop in the Anglican Communion's 450-year history,said Sunday her elevation is the latest step in a movement to bringthe church into the mainstream.   Ms. Harris, 58, a former public relations executive, was electedSaturday to the position of suffragan, or assistant, bishop for theeastern Massachusetts diocese of the Episcopal Church. The diocese,which includes Boston, is the nation's largest in both geographyand population.   ``A fresh wind is blowing across this church of ours,'' she saidin her first sermon at Philadelphia's Church of the Advocate sinceher election.   Several elections earlier this year show the church is changing,said Ms. Harris, who is black. Two black priests were electedcoadjutor bishops, who are first in line to succeed their presidingbishops, without first serving as assistants.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Social initiatives from welfare to child careare hanging in the balance as Congress draws toward adjournment,increasingly impatient and preoccupied with presidential politics.   In a year of rhetoric about the American family, lawmakers haveyet to complete action on major initiatives to raise the minimumwage, expand and improve child care, reform the welfare system andguarantee leave to workers with pressing family responsibilities.   A number of appropriations bills, including one providing about$300 billion for the Defense Department, have been approved in someform, but differences remain between the House and Senate versions.   Also on the incomplete roster is the biggest environmental billof the 100th Congress, a revision of the Clean Air Act tostrengthen the battle against urban air pollution, acid rain andairborne toxic substances.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Trees, forest upon forest of them, are beingadvanced as one of mankind's best friends for future efforts tocombat global overheating from the ``greenhouse effect.''   Right now, however, trees represent one of the Earth's worstenemies.   Left alone, trees are storage ``sinks'' that consume largequantities of carbon dioxide, the worst of the greenhouse gasesthat scientists say are collecting in the atmosphere and trappingheat that once escaped into space.   But a tree felled by a logger or consumed by fire is doublydangerous: not only will it no longer consume carbon dioxide, itsdeath releases stored carbon dioxide to join the atmosphericaccumulation that scientists say will produce major global climatechanges in the 21st century.</TEXT><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A long-awaited study being released this weekcould dramatically change the way doctors are paid, sharplyreducing fees for many kinds of operations while raising chargesfor office visits.   The study has been the object of intense speculation andapprehension in the medical world since it was undertaken 2{ yearsago by economist William C. Hsiao of the Harvard University Schoolof Public Health.   The massive project attempts to determine the amount of workinvolved in everything doctors do _ from checkups and well-babyvisits to brain surgery and coronary bypasses _ so they can be paidwhat their services are worth.   There is widespread agreement, Hsiao said, ``that the currentpayment system is unworkable. The fees are distorted andinequitable.''</TEXT><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of people gathered Sunday in an unusualofficially sanctioned rally to commemorate the Nazi massacre ofJews at a ravine called Babi Yar. But several speakers directedtheir anger not at the Germans but the Soviet government.   ``Babi Yar was a prelude to the spiritual genocide of the Jewishpeople of our country,'' Yuri Sokol, a veteran of World War II,told at least 500 people huddled on a tree-lined road outside thegates of Moscow's Vostryakov Cemetery.   A few years ago, police would have broken up such ademonstration as an anti-Soviet outpouring of nationalism. Butunder Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, oropenness, only a few policemen were on hand and did not interfere.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Network documentaries, a string of new books,an all-night Capitol vigil and memorials by former Peace Corpsvolunteers and PT boat veterans will help commemorate the 25thanniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy in November.   But family members plan a low-profile remembrance, muchdifferent from the 1983 nationally televised observance of the 20thanniversary of that fateful day in Dallas.   ``They have tried to get away from commemorating the day of hisdeath and try to celebrate the day of his birth,'' said MelodyMiller, an aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. The senator andother family members have said they will not grant interviews.   Some family members likely will follow tradition and quietlyvisit JFK's grave site at the Arlington National Cemetery, whileothers join family matriarch Rose Kennedy at her regular daily Massat the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Mass., said Ms. Miller, along-time Kennedy aide who worked for the late Robert F. Kennedy.</TEXT><DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The emergence of rival Christian andMoslem governments threatens to plunge Lebanon once again into acivil war fueled by outside powers that long have used the countryas a proxy battlefield.   The crisis could formalize the de facto partition of Lebanoninto sectarian cantons carved out during the 13-year civil war,which killed about 150,000 people.   Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon, backs the Moslemgovernment and the Shiite Moslem Amal militia. Israel and Iraqsupport the right-wing Christians. Libya funds the Druse militia,which sent volunteers to fight alongside Col. Moammar Gadhafi'sarmy in Chad.   Iran arms and bankrolls the Shiite fundamentalists. Saudi Arabiahelps the Sunni Moslems, but fundamentalist Sunnis also look toIran for support.</TEXT><DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cleveland's largest suburb is running adstelling minorities they are welcome in the nearly all-whitecommunity, but officials say the court-ordered campaign is gettinga lukewarm response.   Parma launched the advertising campaign in January on ordersfrom a judge who ruled the middle-class suburb of 92,000 illegallytried to keep minorities out.   The public relations effort has included a booklet forprospective residents, a three-month radio campaign and year-longadvertisements in three local newspapers, including The Call andPost, a black-oriented weekly.   The ads proclaim Parma ``welcomes people of all races, religionsand national origins.'' and is an ``interracial community offeringthe advantages of a comfortable and stable suburban lifestyle.''   Parma has spent about $70,000 on the campaign and signed a$12,000 contract with The Cuyahoga Plan, a countywide fair housingorganization, to answer calls responding to the advertising.</TEXT><TEXT>   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The rebellion in the rank and fileof the 7,000-man army has dramatically reformed the high command,replacing corrupt and repressive remnants of the Duvalierdictatorship with competent professionals.   ``There is a democratic revolution going on in the army. Nodecision is made without the enlisted men,'' said Serge Gilles,co-leader of the Patriotic Unity Bloc, a coalition of threedemocratic political parties.   The army purge began Sept. 17, when enlisted men and theirsergeants ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, the head of government.They replaced him with Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who as a brigadiergeneral had been the army's top administrative officer.</TEXT><DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rising out of the azure waters like theCaribbean god of wind, Hurricane Gilbert smashed idyllic resortsand industrial cities during an eight-day rampage across theCaribbean and Mexico.   Gilbert grew into a hurricane with winds of 74 mph on Sept. 10,100 miles southwest of Puerto Rico, sending the first waves oftorrential rain and panic to impoverished towns in Haiti and theDominican Republic.   By the time Gilbert lost its hurricane status over northeasternMexico, it had killed more than 300 people, left hundreds ofthousands homeless and caused billions of dollars damage to theCaribbean, Central America, Mexico and the United States.   Gilbert's trail of destruction across nine nations occurreddespite the technological advances of modern-day weatherforecasting. Airplanes flew into the eye of the hurricane severaltimes daily and meteorologists with computers predicted the storm'snext target.</TEXT></DOC>
