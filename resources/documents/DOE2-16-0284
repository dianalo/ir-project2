Although the addition of sulphur scavenger suchas Na{sub 2}O, Ca(NO{sub 3}){sub 2} and Mn(NO{sub 3}){sub 2} hardly affectsthe gasification of graphite, the sulphur content in graphite is decreasedand the conversion in the region of low temperature gasification is increasedby the heating and NHO{sub 3}-treatment. The NHO{sub 3}-treatment isefficient especially for increasing the low-temperature gasificationactivity of coal char as well as natural graphite. The HNO{sub 3}- treatmentseems not only to be effective for the uptake of sulphur but also tohave the secondary effect showing good dispersion of the catalyst byintroducing the functional group such as-COOH and-OH derived from theoxidation of carbonaceous material.
