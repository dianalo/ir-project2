The sample is placedbetween the gamma source and the scintillator. The frontal surfaces ofthe scintillator are optically connected to two photomultipliers. Theoutput of each of them is connected through a pulse elongator to a linearsummator connected to an amplitude discriminator. More than one amplitudediscriminator are used with their inputs connected to a common entrypoint, and the output of each one, through a logical element AND, isconnected to a corresponding input of a logical element OR, the outputof which is connected to the registration and handling unit. The secondentry of each logical element AND is connected to a corresponding outputof a unit for determination of the irradiated zone. The inputs of thisunit are connected to the outputs of the photomultipliers.</TEXT></DOC>
