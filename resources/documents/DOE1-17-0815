It would be desirable to determine the nuclear matrix elementsof this process from beta decay measurements, but some of the transitionsinvolved for existing and proposed neutrino detectors are not accessibleto beta decay. The (p,n) reaction can induce the appropriate transitionswith almost no momentum transfer to the nucleus. Thus, (p,n) measurementshold a promise of providing needed information to predict neutrino absorptioncross sections. The use of this technique is reviewed.</TEXT></DOC>
