(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state House Judiciary Committee hasrejected three gun-control measures, including a proposed ban onmilitary-style assault weapons introduced after five pupils werekilled in a California schoolyard.   The panel on Wednesday threw out the bill offered by PeterFranchot after voting against police-supported amendments that wouldhave replaced a general definition of assault rifles with 28weapons. The amendments would have made it illegal to sell handgunsholding 20 or more bullets or detachable magazines forsemi-automatic rifles, but would have let people keep guns theyalready own.   Most opposition during debate Wednesday was to the amendments'lateness.   Franchot's bill was introduced after five elementary studentswere killed in January when Patrick Edward Purdy used an assaultrifle to spray a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard with more than 100bullets in less than two minutes.   The panel also killed a bill that would have required the sale ofguns from one private owner to another be reported to state police,and one that would have increased penalties for people caughtcarrying guns without permits.   Under Maryland law, semi-automatic weapons can be bought over thecounter without a background check or waiting period, and only salesby licensed dealers are reported to the police.   The committee's action was a victory for the National RifleAssociation, which had spent a record $6 million in an unsuccessfulcampaign to overturn a new Maryland law that bans cheap handguns.</TEXT></DOC>
