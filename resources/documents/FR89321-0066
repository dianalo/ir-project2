This effort supports the mission of the DOE Office ofMinority Economic Impact as defined in 211(d) of Pub. L. 95-619, Section641, and Executive Order 12320, HBCUs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>summary:</T2> The study will identify intra-individual differencesbetween minority students at HBCUs who complete science-based curriculumsand those who do not, and evaluate the findings against the socioeconomicstatus of the students. Several techniques will be utilized in viewingstudent distinctions that may impact retention. These include the Strong-CampbellInterest Inventory to compare the interest of the students in science-basedfields and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicators to assess the students decision-makingstyle. These and other techniques will be used to group students and evaluatewhich factors can be used to help spot potential dropouts and to developappropriate support systems to increase retention rates of minorities inscience-based studies. The study will focus on retention rate from an individual,rather than an institutional view point. This noncompetitive financial assistance award is necessary to enhancethe public benefits by developing techniques that will contribute to thesolution of underpresentation of minority groups in science and engineeringas indicated in recent studies from the National Task Force on Women, Minoritiesand the Handicapped in Science and Engineering. There is no known otherentity which is conducting or is planning to conduct a study focused onretention factors of underpresented minorities from an individual viewpoint.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>For further information contact:</T2> Birdie Hamilton-Ray, U.S. Departmentof Energy San Francisco Operations Office, 1333 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94612.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Oakland, California, March 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Kathleen M.
