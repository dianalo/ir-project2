Seven-Up Co.filed a bitterly worded lawsuit against Coca-Cola Co.,claiming that the cola company has been spreading lies aboutSeven-Up's business in an unlawful quest to persuade certainbottlers to drop Seven-Up in favor of Sprite.   The lawsuit, filed in State District Court in DallasCounty, Texas, charges that Coke, which manufactures Sprite,has embarked on a &quot;Future Belongs to Sprite&quot; campaign. Thatcampaign, according to the lawsuit, is disseminating &quot;lies,deceptions and misrepresentations&quot; about its operations andprospects to companies that bottle both Coke and Seven-Upproducts.</LP><TEXT>   Coke is doing so, the lawsuit contends, to persuade someof the 74 independent bottlers that currently distribute bothCoke and Seven-Up products, to sever ties with Seven-Up.Bottlers buy concentrate from Coke or Seven-Up, mix it withcarbonated water, bottle and can it, and distribute it inretail outlets.   The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory damages andpunitive damages of at least $500 million.   A spokesman at Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, said thecompany hasn't seen the lawsuit and had no comment.   The complaint underscores the interdependency of the largesoft-drink companies for brands and distribution, and howtheir marketing interests can come into sharp conflict.Independent Coca-Cola bottlers distribute about 7% ofSeven-Up's volume in the U.S.   At the same time, Coca-Cola has been making a bigger pushinto the lemon-lime market, the second-biggest soft-drinkcategory after cola, with its own Sprite brand. And that pushhas paid off. Combining regular and diet versions, Spritesurpassed Seven-Up in 1988, and drove its lead in thelemon-lime market last year to nearly 39%, according to theMaxwell Consumer Report, a trade publication, compared with31.4% for Seven-Up. Pepsi's Slice accounted for only 11%.   &quot;Coca-Cola has become a major factor in the lemon-limemarketplace,&quot; says Jesse Meyers, publisher of BeverageDigest.   Indeed, the lawsuit argues that once Seven-Up is droppedby a Coke/Seven-Up bottler, it is very difficult for Seven-Upto remain an effective competitor in that franchisedterritory. The consequence of that is a weaker Seven-Up,which is already highly leveraged, and less soft-drinkselection and higher prices for consumers, the lawsuit said.   Seven-Up charged that last March, Coca-Cola approached theNacogdoches Bottling Co. in Texas, giving it material withfalse and misleading information about Seven-Up. In January,the Nacogdoches bottler said it planned to cancel itscontract with Seven-Up, ending a 20-year relationship.Seven-Up said Coke is making similar presentations to otherindependent Coke bottlers in Texas and around the country inan attempt to interfere unlawfully with Seven-Up's contractsand business relationships.   Seven-Up said it is asking the court to enjoin Coke fromengaging in additional unlawful conduct.   Bottlers said that Seven-Up filed the lawsuit because itso depends on the reach of Coke's distribution systems to getits products to consumers. &quot;They're fighting to stay withCoke,&quot; said one bottling company executive.   Seven-Up, based in Dallas, is a unit of Dr Pepper/Seven-UpCos.</TEXT></DOC>
