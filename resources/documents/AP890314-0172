ROTSTEIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Air Force investigators are looking ateverything from weather to maintenance and weight to determine why ahelicopter crashed, and seem to have ruled out only night-visiongoggles, a spokesman said Tuesday.   All 15 aboard died in Sunday night's crash in the desert 25 milesnorthwest of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, where the helicopter hadstopped to refuel.   Authorities said the main rotor shaft nut, a fastener about afoot in diameter that holds the main rotor head to the helicopterframe, had been replaced two days before the crash. Although thatwasn't thought to have been a factor in the crash, it wasn't ruledout, officials said.   Investigators have ``tried to look at all the different aspects,all of the potential variables, things like weather, things like ...maintenance, fuel,'' said Capt. Carlos Roque, a spokesman atDavis-Monthan.   Roque said the only possible cause that has been ruled out is theuse of controversial night-vision goggles, which have been an issuein numerous military helicopter crashes.   Officials have confirmed that when the CH-3E helicopter went downin flames, its four crew members were wearing the light-amplifyinggoggles as they ferried 11 Army Special Forces members from an Armypost southeast of Tucson to an Air Force gunnery range 124 milesnorthwest.   The soldiers, whose names were not released immediately, werefrom Fort Bragg, N.C.   Authorities at Davis-Monthan were gathering medical and dentalrecords of the 15 victims to aid in identification of the badlyburned bodies. A temporary morgue was set up in advance of thearrival of a forensic team.   Navy Cmdr. David Thomas in Washington said more than 300 CH-3Esand similar helicopters belonging to the Air Force, Navy and CoastGuard were grounded for a week that ended Friday to inspect therotor nut.   Lt. Col. Darrel Hayes, an Air Force spokesman at the Pentagon,said the nuts were considered potentially defective. He said thehelicopter that went down had been inspected Friday and its nutreplaced, and that it was flown safely three times before the crash.   ``As we understand it, when they replaced the rotor nut, they haddone a flight test on it, then rechecked it, retorqued it. And ithas all sorts of special safety pins on it to keep it in place. Andthen it had flown three times since then,'' Hayes said.   ``So it wasn't as if it was something they just did and itbroke,'' Hayes added. He said that while maintenance always is anissue in a crash, ``it just doesn't fit with what we know.''   On Monday, officials at Davis-Monthan imposed an indefiniterestriction on the five remaining CH-3Es belonging to the 71stSpecial Operations Command.   ``At some point, they will be permitted to fly again, aftersomething is done, probably an inspection or a changeover of somesort, or whatever the investigators recommend,'' Roque said. ``Rightnow it's indefinite, but it's not permanent.''</TEXT></DOC>
