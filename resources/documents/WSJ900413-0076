Nearly two weeks after the April 1 target day, the bureausaid only 57% of the 103 million households that were mailedcensus forms have returned them. The bureau is hoping for aminimum 70% return rate by mail. It plans to count theremaining households in a massive, and costly, householdcanvass this spring and summer.</LP><TEXT>   Census Director Barbara Bryant said each 1% of the returnrate that falls below the 70% goal will cost taxpayers anextra $10 million. The money will be spent to hire and payextra door-to-door enumerators. At the same time, censusofficials concede that tens of thousands of Americans haven'treceived their 1990 population forms due partly to erroneousmailing lists.   Census officials were prepared for a poor response ratefrom low-income neighborhoods and areas with high immigrantpopulations. But Ms. Bryant expressed surprise at the numberof affluent households ignoring their forms.   &quot;We understand that over the last 10 years, the Americanpeople have been bombarded by direct and junk mail,&quot; Ms.Bryant said. She called the census form &quot;one piece of mailthat counts.&quot;   Population totals from the decennial census are used toallocate seats in the House of Representatives and statelegislatures. They are also the benchmark for handing outbillions of dollars in government grants.</TEXT></DOC>
