Thisreport outlines the unit turbine body, performance, control system, andits application on TU-SWVAWT. Effort of development was firstly concentratedto the conceptual design of optimal airfoils for the blade of SWVAWTwhich was embodied in the design of the Tokai Wind Turbine, and a seriesof wind-tunnel testing was made to confirm its wind dynamical characteristicsto collect operating experiences under real, fluctuating wind conditions.Applications of this wind turbine are seen in such examples as a directpump drive, such water feed and discharge as irrigation, power source(AC, DC), air conditioning, hot water supply, and fuel applications.(21 figs, 8 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
