The maximum individual CEA drop time restriction would be used tolimit the CEA drop time distribution from the arithmetic average.The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed amendments are required to allow effective use of the newCEA Drop Time Test software methodology in use at San Onofre Nuclear GeneratingStation, Unit Nos. 2 and 3. In order to preclude a delayed entry into Mode2 (Startup) following testing using the new methodology, the proposed amendmentswould allow an increase in the margin between the Technical Specificationlimit and the measured values derived from the new methodology.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe proposed action would not involve a significant change in the probabilityor consequences of any accident previously evaluated, nor does it involvea new or different kind of accident. Consequently, any radiological releasesresulting from an accident would not be significantly greater than previouslydetermined. The proposed amendments do not otherwise affect routine radiologicalplant effluents. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are nosignificant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposedamendments. The Commission also concludes that the proposed action willnot result in a significant increase in individual or cumulative occupationalradiation exposure.With regard to nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendments do notaffect nonradiological plant effluents and have no other environmentalimpact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significantnonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendments.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 7, 1989 (54 FR 37172). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice.Alternatives to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredin connection with the Final Environmental Statement related to operationof San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Units 2 and 3, dated April 1981and its Errata dated June 1981.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' request that supports the proposedamendments. The NRC staff did not consult other agencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed amendments.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludesthat the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the qualityof the human environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendments dated July 31, 1989 which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,DC 20555, and at the General Library, University of California, P.O.
