As damage estimates surpassed $4 billion, merchants throughoutthe area rushed to fill orders for glass, plywood, cement,flashlights, power generators _ and tarpaulins to shield from arainstorm sweeping in this weekend.   ``It seems like the biggest problem now is going to be therain,'' said Rusty Santee, the owner of San Jose's Central HomeSupply. ``All those people who have a chimney down or a hole intheir roof need a tarp. What the earthquake missed, the rain shouldget.''   Of course, many homeowners could do nothing. Their homes wereeither beyond repair or were condemned as unsafe.   Multiquip Inc., a distributor of light construction equipment,is toiling to ship electrical generators to the area.   ``The industry is in extremely bad shape to take care of the SanFrancisco disaster because of hurricane Hugo,'' Irv Levine, thefirm's president, said from the firm's Carson, Calif.,headquarters. ``We were totally cleaned out of generators. We'rescrambling to get as many as we can.''   More than 25,000 homes were still without power Friday morning.Levine said his company's reserve stock of 1,000 generators is gone.   ``We are renting lots of light towers, hydraulic house jacks,skip loaders and scissor lifts,'' said Steve Probasco, a manager atSan Jose's A-1 Rents. ``For things we're out off, we're directingour customers to our competitors.''   Amid the growing demand for repair materials, merchants mustcombat inoperative telephone lines, jammed or closed freeways andsometimes severe damage to their own headquarters.   The main San Francisco warehouse for auto-glass giant PPGIndustries was closed by the quake, with loss of inventoryestimated in excess of $50,000, said branch manager Howard Burrell.   ``We're shipping from other locations,'' Burrell said as thecompany tried to replace scores of broken windshields. ``We'reinoperative here.''   While the shipping delays almost certainly will result in higherprices for some materials, there have been no reports of pricegouging for items in shortest supply. ``I'm not trying to get intoa price war,'' said Probasco. ``We're just here to help people.''   Dale Williams, owner of Central Allied Glass with a dozen storesin the earthquake's vicinity, said that many homeowners are waitingfor aftershocks to subside before replacing broken windows.   ``A lot of people don't want to put glass in right away,''Williams said. ``They want to relax and wait until there's no moreshaking.   ``But from our understanding, everybody's glass stock is ingreat shape. They're not having problems with the distributors.''Other glass companies are boarding up most broken windows and areplanning to complete glass replacements in coming weeks.   ``If a store has lost its front, that's our first priority,''said Howard Cobel, vice president of Oakland's Cobel Glass Inc.``We're just boarding up now and we'll start installing glass thisweekend.''   At Goodman Lumber Co. in San Francisco, the huge building-supplystore has organized a special display with earthquake-related itemslike crescent wrenches, plaster, plumber's tape, fire extinguishersand flashlights.   ``We have sold out our stock of flashlights and batteries threeor four times over,'' said owner Charles Goodman. ``We are reallyexpecting to sell a lot of plywood. We're expecting quite a busyweekend. We have never had a situation like this before.''   At the same time, retailers are busy with a surge in demand forconsumer goods like bottled water, cleaning supplies like brooms,mops, buckets and paper towels.   ``Water right now is the No. 1 priority,'' said Deborah Lambert,Safeway Stores' Northern California manager for public relations.   Closer to the quake's epicenter, the idea of mops andflashlights is far from the top priority.   In Boulder, 14 miles north of Santa Cruz, more landslides wereexpected in the mountains where 60 homes already have beendestroyed and at least 100 more directly threatened.   ``The geologists will see if the cracks are in the bedrock or inthe ground,'' said Bud Tomlin, Boulder Creek's fire district chief.``If it was just soil that was loose, that would be easier becausewe could shore up the houses.   ``If there are cracks in the bedrock, the whole mountain couldcome down.''</TEXT></DOC>
