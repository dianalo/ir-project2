Lotus, best known for its 1-2-3 program for International Business Machines Corp.'s personal computers, makes a program called Jazz for the Macintosh, but the program hasn't sold well.    Lotus said its new program, Galaxy, will be unveiled this summer. It will incorporate Jazz features such as a spreadsheet, word processor and graphics capability. The new program will add improved communications capabilities and a command language that lets users write their own programs for doing complex tasks with a single keystroke.    Lotus declined to discuss pricing plans or say whether Jazz will be discontinued. </TEXT></DOC>
