The assemblyproperties of exhaustively dephosphorylated NF subunits were found tobe similar to those of untreated subunits, as determined by SDS-PAGEand electron microscopy. Moreover, in vitro dephosphorylation removedonly about half of the phosphate moieties suggesting the possible presenceof inaccessible phosphorylation site(s). The expression of all threeNF subunits in cultured adrenal chromaffin cells was demonstrated byimmunocytochemical staining, and by immunoprecipitation techniques. TheNFs in chromaffin cells, which are largely restricted to the perikaryon,were found to be hypophosphorylated, as they comigrated with in vitrodephosphorylated bovine NF subunits on SDS-PAGE. Triton-soluble poolsof NF-M, and NF-H were shown to be present in chromaffin cells. Thesewere found to be distinct from the cytoskeleton-associated NF subunitsbased on differences in their relative amounts, and in the rate of {sup32}P turnover. In addition, differences in the phosphopeptide maps ofTriton-soluble and cytoskeletal NF-M suggested that certain phosphorylationsites may be important in regulating NF subunit assembly.</TEXT></DOC>
