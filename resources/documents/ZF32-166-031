 For users, E-mail has rapidly moved from a method ofcommunication among a few propeller heads to the approved method ofconducting intra- and inter-company business.andP;  E-mail is now the basis fordocument exchange and order processing among dissimilar systems.andP;  And, as wemove from the era of personal computing and personal productivity enhancementto the area of networked corporate computing, E-mail has quickly become theplatform upon which users can build customized, workgroup applications toincrease the productivity and effectiveness of their organizations.andM;PC Software LeadersandM;Enter E-Mail MarketandM;Vendors have historically had some problems in approaching LAN-basedelectronic mail.andP;  In an area traditionally dominated by the mainframe/minigiants--the IBMs and Digitals with their PROFS and All-In-1--PC softwarecompanies were generally content to leave the challenge to the networkoperating system vendors, such as 3Com and Banyan, or to startups, such asAction Technologies (which developed MHS) and cc:Mail.andP;  The big guys, such asMicrosoft, Lotus, and WordPerfect, were content to battle for the four majordesktop productivity applications: &quot;word processing, spreadsheets, wordprocessing, and spreadsheets.&quot;andM;More recently, however, these same PC software developers have &quot;discovered&quot;that communication between people and applications was becoming moreimportant than the individual applications themselves.andP;  Each company hasbegun to define the communications-based architecture that will carry intothe twenty-first century.andP;  And at the center of each architecture--orunderlying the applications layer of each architecture--we find a ubiquitouselectronic mail service, a service that each of these vendors has decided toprovide itself, both to enhance its suite of office offerings and because,right now and in the future, providing electronic mail is a very goodbusiness.andM;Importance of E-Mail to Lotus, Microsoft, WordPerfectandM;E-Mail Is Key toandM;Asserting Dominance onandM;the DesktopandM;The trend toward the importance of electronic mail is clear, but why thesudden flurry of activity over E-mail right now?andP;  Why is WordPerfect devotingclose to 150 developers to its WordPerfect Office (E-mail, calendar/schedule,personal productivity) product?andP;  Why have Lotus and Microsoft madesignificant investments to acquire the two leaders in the LAN-based mailmarket--cc:Mail and Consumers Software, respectively?andM;The answer is that the three software giants are fighting for more than ashare of the electronic mail market's pie chart.andP;  With the emergence ofWindows as the desktop and application design center of choice for themajority of users, and with developers scrambling to provide tools,development environments, and applications, the opportunity has arisen forthe large software vendors to assert dominance on the desktop.andP;  If one ofthem could offer users and developers alike a single integrated developmentand user environment with all of the tools and traditional applications andwith a robust interface into the messaging service, that company couldconceivably shut out the others.andP;  This fear originally drove Lotus andWordPerfect to band together against Microsoft.andP;  It is now driving all threeto develop or buy all of the components so that they can offer users asingle-vendor solution.andP;  And while these vendors have traditionally competedin the productivity applications, the first big battle of the war for theWindows desktop is being fought over the dominance of electronic mail.andM;Choosing an E-mail Package for WindowsandM;Four Key IssuesandM;As the big three approach the exploding Windows market with their E-mailpackages, users are basing their connectivity choices on four major issues:andM;* Platforms and interconnectivityandM;* Application integrationandM;* User interfaceandM;* Advanced featuresandM;It should be noted that the basic mail feature (send, receive, cc:, reply,forward, etc.) are no longer differentiators, as each E-mail package canhandle them all.andP;  What is important to users are these four issues (with thefirst paramount) and the recurring considerations of price, performance, andscalability.andP;  But the most important choice that users are currently facingis deciding which vendor to tie their future to (see &quot;A User's View of theE-Mail Wars,&quot; page 21).andM;Platforms and InterconnectivityandM;Multiplatform SupportandM;and Interconnectivity AreandM;EssentialandM;We live in a homogeneous world, both in our own companies and as part of themore generalized world of suppliers, customers, and colleagues.andP;  While theindustry's major focus is currently on the Windows platform, the ability tocommunicate across platforms is essential for a successful mail packagebecause it is essential for the way we conduct our businesses.andP;  This isespecially true if mail is being used as the base-level method of informationand document interchange where no direct application-to-applicationinterchange functionality exists.andP;  And, as mail becomes the basis of groupapplications and application-to-application messaging, limiting it to one ortwo platforms is unacceptable.andM;The current set of mail packages has had to address the interconnectivityissue in two ways:andM;* Provide a comparably functional front end for the key desktops (Windows,DOS, Macintosh, and, eventually, Unix and OS/2) with access to common messagefiles and/or a common mail engine.andM;* Provide gateways from the local LAN-based system to other LANs and moregeneral public and private networks, including proprietary mail systems,X.400-based systems, and fax.andP;  A key issue here, one which goes beyond simpleconnectivity, is how we can easily (hopefully seamlessly) address messages topeople on different systems.andM;Both of these areas include more than the issue of sending text messagesacross different desktops, systems, and networks.andP;  They also must deal withthe issues of sending, receiving, and viewing more complex documents whereviewers and launchers (see &quot;Application Integration&quot; below) may not beeffective--e.g., a VT100 terminal user on a VAX is unlikely to be able tolaunch a PC Paintbrush file.andP;  And application-to-application communicationacross platforms and gateways must be considered--e.g., a PROFS gatewayshould support cross-system group scheduling as well as mail interchange(which, for example, WordPerfect Office's PROFS gateway will do--see below).andM;Application IntegrationandM;Traditionally, users have had two types of integration problems withelectronic mail.andP;  The first is how to deal with mailed documents andattachments that are not simple text files.andP;  The second is how to use theirpreferred tools and applications (particularly their word processor or texteditor) to create and access mail messages.andM;First Step Is Viewers andandM;LaunchersandM;Files that contain heavily formatted documents, graphics and images, or voiceattachments generally cannot be viewed by users on any system or in anyapplication but the one that created the document.andP;  Some electronic mailpackages deal with this issue by providing sets of viewers that allow theuser to see but not edit the attachments.andP;  A separate viewer must be builtfor each type of file that the user wishes to see (i.e., one for Word, onefor WordPerfect, one for 1-2-3, one for PC Paintbrush, etc.).andM;Some electronic mail systems provide launchers, either as a replacement foror in conjunction with viewers.andP;  Launchers first determine whether theapplication that created the attachment is available on the receiver'ssystem, and, if it is, then launch that application, bringing up theattachment.andP;  The user then can view and edit the attachment.andP;  Launchers alsohave to be specifically written for each applicationandM;Use of DDE and OLE IsandM;Next Step in ApplicationandM;IntegrationandM;We are beginning to see more advanced methods of enabling application viewingand launching.andP;  One of the strengths of Windows is its ability to providemethods of transparently linking separate applications.andP;  Through Dynamic DataExchange (DDE), an application can get data from another application in realtime.andP;  For example, a charting package can be linked to a spreadsheet ordatabase to provide the latest up-to-date data for the charts every time itis run.andP;  Similarly, a report in a word processor can be linked to the latestsales figures or stock prices that reside in another application.andM;Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), which was more recently introduced byMicrosoft, adds the ability of one application to embed another applicationwithin itself.andP;  For example, a document may have an image embedded in itwhich is displayed and printed within the document.andP;  When the user selectsthe image (generally by double-clicking), a window with the application ortool that created the image is opened if the application is available on thereceiver's system, and the user can perform all of the imaging actions on theimage.andP;  The image in the document immediately reflects the changes that theuser has made.andM;A major benefit of DDE and OLE support for electronic mail packages is topotentially eliminate the need for viewers and launchers.andP;  For example, withOLE, rather than needing a Lotus 1-2-3 launcher, a user receiving a 1-2-3worksheet as an attachment or as an embedded object in the mail messageitself, could simply double-click on the worksheet area and bring it up in alive 1-2-3 window.andP;  However, the great advantage is not in the replacement of1-2-3 and WordPerfect viewers and launchers; most mail packages already havethese.andP;  The real leverage of OLE is that any new application supporting OLEwill automatically be able to be embedded.andP;  The mail vendor need know nothingabout it.andM;Another Level ofandM;Integration: BuildingandM;Custom ApplicationsandM;The second aspect of application integration is to allow mail functionalityto be integrated into the user's preferred suite of applications.andP;  Theinitial requirement has been to allow users to send and receive mail fromwithin their desktop tools such as word processors and spreadsheets.andP;  DaVinci(see &quot;Long Shot Entries May Lead the Way&quot; below), for example, has closelyintegrated its electronic mail client with Microsoft's Word for Windows.andO;Users can now send and receive mail directly from within a Word document bysimply accessing a pull-down menu selection.andM;More and more, this aspect of application integration is moving to enablingcustomized and off-the-shelf applications to access the mail engine for theirown use.andP;  For example, a formsrouting application could send the forms overthe electronic mail transport to the next user who is supposed to receive theform.andP;  Or a calendar/scheduling system can send meeting requests directlyinto the user's electronic mail inbox.andP;  The user's acceptance or rejection ofthe meeting invitation could then be sent via the mail transport to thescheduling application.andM;APIs.andP;  This type of application integration is achieved through the use ofApplication Programming Interfaces (APIs) to the mail package.andP;  There are twotypes of APIs into mail systems: file-based APIs and programmatic APIs.andM;File-based APIs are based on an import/export paradigm.andP;  They allowdevelopers to build custom gateways to the mail application.andP;  This enablesthe seamless exchange of mail messages and attachments between mail and otherapplications.andM;Programmatic APIs are more granular and provide direct access to the maildatabase.andP;  Programmatic APIs allow mail engines to be used as moregeneralized servers for message-based and workgroup applications.andP;  However,programmatic APIs tend to be more complex to implement.andM;We can see the differences in APIs by examining how a group-schedulingapplication could be integrated with a mail application.andP;  Using a file-basedAPI, a scheduling application can send meeting invitations into the user'smailbox.andP;  However, in order to access the name service or security featuresof the mail system, the scheduling application requires a programmaticinterface.andP;  By using the programmatic API, new users could, for example, havea personal calendar automatically created for them when they are added to themail engine's name database.andM;User InterfaceandM;As users become accustomed to graphic interfaces, the issues of userinterface arise again.andP;  While all Windows users do not necessarily demand theprettiest, most complex icons for their applications, they do want theirapplications to fit neatly into the Windows environment.andP;  This means beingeasy to use and being consistent with the Windows paradigms andlook-and-feel.andP;  The warning, as Lotus has found with 1-2-3 V.3.1, is thatmouse support and pull-down menus are not enough.andM;Advanced Features as DifferentiatorsandM;We are entering a new era when standard mail functions, are easy-to-useinterface, open APIs, and wide interconnectivity will be the norm, and wheremail packages will begin to differentiate themselves by providing a set ofadvanced, user-oriented features.andP;  These features include:andM;* Integrated calendar/schedulerandM;* Inbox filteringandM;* Multimedia supportandM;* Enhanced remote delivery optionsandM;* Alternate computing devicesandM;IntegratedandM;Calendar/SchedulerandM;One of the first mail-enabled group applications emerging on the LAN platformis that old integrated office system standby, the personal calendar/groupscheduler.andP;  And while mail-system independent, LAN-based calendar/schedulingsystems have been available for some time, the trend now is to go back toearlier systems, such as Enable Sofware's Higgins group productivity package,and closely tie the calendar/scheduling function to a specific mail service.andO;WordPerfect has offered this capability on WordPerfect Office for some timenow, while cc: Mail has recently purchased the rights to PowerCore's NetworkScheduler II cc: Mail version (Network Scheduler II also runs on top ofMicrosoft Main and MHS), which it plans to merge into the cc: Mail product.andO;Microsoft has just announced an integrated calendar/scheduler for itsMacintosh-based mail product and is undoubtedly planning to add thiscapability for Windows.andM;Calendar/scheduler applicatons can be integrated with electronic mail inthree ways:andM;* The group scheduling system can use the mail transport to move the messagebetween users' personal calendar/scheduler applications and the schedulingserver.andM;* The group scheduling system can send the meeting requests and  repliesright into the users' electronic mail inboxes.andM;* The group scheduling system can sned the messages for those who keep apersonal calendar into their calendar application, while those don't keep apersonal calendar on the system receive the message requests in their E-mailapplication.andM;Inbox FilteringandM;As exemplified by MIT's Information Lens project and the soon-to-be-releasedmail product from Beyond (Cambridge, Massachussets), inbox filtering helpsusers deal more easily with the large amounts of information that theyreceive electronically.andP;  Using simple rules, users can sort, prioritize,file, or automatically have action taken on incoming messages.andP;  Typicalactions include: moving the message to a specidfic folder, forwarding themessage to a designated person or distribution list, and generating anautomatic reply.andP;  The rules can be based on one or more criteria, includingwho sent the message, the message subject, the message type, keywords in themessage, etc.andP;  A simple example, based on the group scheduling example, wouldbe to have any message that comes from the group scheduler be forwarded to mysecretary and stored in a &quot;Pending Meetings&quot; folder.andP;  (For a full examinationof leading-edge filtering technology, see Vol.andP;  13, No.11.)andM;Multimedia SupportandM;The next generation of electronic mail systems will begin to include theability to add images and voice and video annotations to the messages.andP;  Theissues of adding multimedia attachments to mail messages and attacheddocuments are actually rather straightforward, the key one being support fora voice or video capture board.andP;  What is far more complex is the exchange ofsuch documents.andP;  Even within the same desktop environment, there is noassurance that one user can view (or listen to) what another hascreated--though, at least on the new Macintoshes, there is a standard audiodevice.andP;  When we try to send this type of mail across platforms, the problemseems unsovable, though the proposed multimedia specifications introduced asWindows and OS/2 extensions by Microsoft and IBM may eventually prove to be asolution.andM;Today, mail vendors are beginning to support multimedia on individualplatforms (generally on the Mac, though Clarity is demonstrating its Unixoffice system, Rapport, which supports multimedia annotations--see &quot;Analysis,Issues, and Opinions,&quot; page 26).andP;  These vendors are still working on how toat least indicate the presence of a foreign media type for recipients onother systems.andM;Enhanced RemoteandM;Delivery OptionsandM;Currently, few, if any, electronic mail systems provide full functionality toremote users, particularly users who are on the road.andP;  At the same time thatthe current packages are being enhanced to make remote use easier and faster,new forms of remote mail access are being proposed.andP;  Most vendors are lookingat supporting cellular modems and packet-switched radio for laptop access tothe network.andP;  Some vendors are going even further.andP;  One such plan, justannounced by ATandamp;T and Motorola, is to use alphnumeric paging networks todownload mail (or at least the sender and subject lines of each message) intoa battery-operated, hand-held pager.andP;  the user is beeped when messages comein and can use a laptop to dial up for the complete message (if it is toolong for the pager--though pager capacities are increasing very quickly) orto respond to a message.andM;We will soon begin to see other interesting remote access options, such asallowing users to dial into the mail system with a touch-tone phone and todesignate which messages should be faxed to them.andP;  Users could also use thiscapability to receive a copy of their appointment calendar or projectassignments.andP;  Digital Equipment has just announced the addition of phone andvoice processing functionality that will enable its office applications andmail to be enhanced to support this type of access.andM;Alternate ComputingandM;DevicesandM;There are a number of new types of computing devices that will have to beaddressed by electronic mail systems.andP;  The two most interesting areas are:pen-based tablets, which support handwriting (actually handprinting)recognition and gesture-based commands; and calculator-sized personalproductivity tools such as the Sharp Wizard or Casio BOSS.andP;  The key to thesuccess of thes alternate devices, as well as any new devices that we haveyet to see or imagine, will be their ability to connect into the generalcorporate information system for data access as well as for electronic mailand calendar/scheduler.andM;Profiling the Major ContendersandM;The battle for LAN-based mail is coming down to the same three contendersthat are fighting for all of our desktop applications: Lotus, Microsoft, andWordPerfect.andP;  For each, mail holds both a tactical role, as a profitableproduct line, and a strategic role, as an essential piece (if not the &quot;glue&quot;)of their overall attempts to gain dominance on the desktop.andM;Lotus cc:MailandM;Lotus's acquisition of cc:Mail has highlighted cc:Mail's importance as aproduct (at the time of its acquisition by Lotus, cc:Mail wa the market shareleader in the LAN-based electronic mail arena).andP;  In addition, when viewedwith Lotus's other acquisition ventures (the aborted Novell merger and thepurchase of Samna and its windows-based AMI Professional word processor), thepurchase emphasizes Lotus's desire (or need) to offer a wide-ranging suite ofproducts to be able to compete with Microsoft's threat to dominate the oftware world.andM;Lotus cc:Mail: StrategyandM;Lotus really has two levels of mail strategy: one Lotus-oriented, whichencompasses Lotus Notes and all of its other desktop offerings; and theother, cc:Mail product-oriented, which is more specific to cc:Mail'scompetition with other E-mail packages.andP;  Since Lotus's acquisition agreementwith cc:Mail has left the latter relatively independent, it will be importantto make certain that neither one is working at cross-purposes.andM;LOTUS STRATEGY.andP;  The acquisition gives Lotus a leadership role in theconnectivity world, as well as extending the breadth and depth of itscorporate-oriented offerings.andP;  In addition, it helps Lotus better positionNotes, which is at the center of its approach to competing for dominance ofthe Windows desktop.andM;As a result of the acquisition, Lotus has made (either overtly or implicitly)a number a statements about the position of cc:Mail and Notes.andM;The major one is the recognition that not everyone will soon become a Notesuser.andP;  This recognition is an important step for Lotus as (1) it finally putsto rest Lotus's position that Notes is an all-or-nothing commitment for thecustomer, and (2) it enables Lotus to concentrate on integration andscalability issues.andP;  The integration issue is brought tio a head by thecc:Mail acquisition.andP;  Though Notes can currently exchange mail with othermail systems, including cc:Mail, Lotus is promising even tighter integrationwith cc:Mail.andP;  This will allow cc:Mail users to have some Notes capabilities.andM;Integrating cc:Mail andandM;NotesandM;As products such as NOtes and cc:Mail become more closely integrated, Lotuswill have the opportunity to make them both able to access the same data.andO;The differences will be in how much of the NOtes functionality can beaccessed from cc:Mail.andP;  This issue of incremental or scalable functionalityis very important to Lotus, which is trying to determine how best to dividethe functionality.andP;  One possible division would be to allow cc:Mail messagesto query Notes databases, returning the appropriate NOtes documents into thecc:Mail inbox.andP;  This could give cc:Mail users access to the key documents andmessages, without the flexibility of views and filters available to Notesusers.andM;Currently, Lotus is planning the integration in three phases:andM;* Coexistence.andP;  This phase will concentrate in enhancing the gateway betweenNotes and cc:Mail.andM;* Partial integration.andP;  During this phase, Lotus will address such issues assynchronizing the directory services and providing cross-product accountmanagement and support.andM;* Integration.andP;  While it is still unclear how this phase will look, Lotusplas at least to be able to combine some of the duplicate functionality, suchas transport and gateways, to better leverage development resources.andM;cc:MAIL STRATEGY.andP;  The strategic thrust for the cc:Mail product is threefold:andM;* Provide equivalent service and unified user interface across all platforms(DOS, Windows, Macintosh, OS/2, and, eventually, Unix)andM;* Move away from providing the messaging platform--transport and nameservice--toward providing the applications and higher-level applicationenablersandM;* Modularize the architecture and application code to make it more portableand scalableandM;Lotus cc:Mail:andM;Architecture andandM;DirectionsandM;The current cc:Mail architecture supports multiple clients (DOS, Windows,Mac, and OS/2) accessing common services on a shared file server.andP;  The commonservices are database, name, and transport.andP;  The mail engine itself runs oneach client.andP;  The messages are stored in a common database on the fileserver.andP;  A single copy is kept with pointers to multiple recipients (exceptfor remote users who must download mail into their inbox).andM;cc:Mail maintains a central name directory for each server.andP;  This includesnames from all other servers on the network.andP;  cc:Mail provides a directorypropagation service to synchronize all of the servers.andP;  Users see a singleimage of the network directory wherever they reside.andP;  Names are accessed byentering the last name or first letter(s) of the last name in a sort ofbrowse mode.andP;  There is no use of location differentiators, such as domains,which makes the lookup very fast and easy, but not very flexible (i.e., Icannot look through all of the members of the marketing group to choose myrecipients.andM;cc:Mail, while committed to moving toward supporting native transport andname service (with Banyan's StreetTalk the first non-cc:Mail name service tobe supported), expects to provide its own transport and naming services forthe foreseeable future.andM;Lotus cc:Mail: The ProductandM;NEW ARCHITECTURE.andP;  cc:Mail is moving from this file-based model to become ahybrid file-based client/server architecture (see Illustration 1).andP;  cc:Mailfeels that this will give users the best of both approaches, while minimizingthe drawbacks of each.andM;cc:Mail for Windows is the most complete and attractive product of the three.andO;In addition to its performance, seductive interface, and interesting newhybrid architecture, cc:Mail provides the best support for multiple datatypes, including image and fax.andM;Platforms andandM;InterconnectivityandM;cc: Mail runs on Windows, DOS, OS/2, and Macintosh, with plans for a Unixversion.andM;Gateways include: X.400, MHS, fax, PROFS and SNADS, All-In-1 and VMSmail,EasyLink, MCI, SMTP, uucp, DeskManager, GEISCO, and SprintMail.andM;Application IntegrationandM;cc: Mail users can use the built-in editor or the user's editor of choice.andO;The Windows version comes with 20 built-in viewers and can launch availableapplications directly from mail to view and edit attachments.andP;  cc: Mail plansto increase the number of DOS viewers by using the viewers found in the LotusMagellan product.andM;cc: Mail has opened up its file-based API.andP;  The Windows version is the firstproduct to use cc: Mail's programmatic API.andP;  This API is not yet open tothird parties, though cc: Mail plans to publish it later this year.andM;USE OF DDE AND OLE.andP;  cc: Mail has promised support for DDE and OLE &quot;verysoon.&quot;andM;User InterfaceandM;cc: Mail for Windows presents the most attractive windows-based userinterface of the three products.andP;  The interface provides icon-based access tothe commonly used menu functions.andP;  And, although we are frequently turned offby over-iconization, we found cc: Mail's implementation to be very seductive.andM;In addition, users can personalize their inboxes by deciding, for example,where and in which order the information about incoming mail appears.andM;cc: Mail also provides users with a bulletin board service.andP;  The company isworking on support for message-threading as well, which would enable moresophisticated conferencing-based applications.andM;Advanced FeaturesandM;CALENDAR/SCHEDULER.andP;  cc: Mail recently purchased group scheduling technologyfrom PowerCore.andP;  PowerCore's product, Network Scheduler II, already runs ontop of cc: Mail (as well as MHS and Microsoft Mail).andP;  cc: Mail plans to moreclosely integrate the scheduler with its mail and to package them togetherlater this year.andM;FILTERING.andP;  cc: Mail is working on inbox management for upcoming releases.andM;MULTIMEDIA.andP;  cc: Mail is not really hot on voice and video attachments.andP;  Thecompany is much more interested in the integration of voice mail andelectronic mail, and is working on this with vendors such as VMX.andM;ENHANCED REMOTE DELIVERY.andP;  cc: Mail has no current plans for supportingalternative remote delivery.andP;  However, Lotus is working on delivering Notes(at least the author and subject lines from Notes databases) to remote usersvia alphanumeric pagers.andM;ALTERNATE COMPUTING PLATFORMS.andP;  cc: Mail is very interested in providing mailproducts for pen-based computers.andP;  The company sees a natural fit,particularly when fax and images are included in the mail.andP;  One example wouldbe a user receiving a fax on a pen-based tablet, annotating the fax withwords or emphasis (underline, circle, etc.) on the tablet, and then mailingit back as a response.andM;Microsoft Mail (Network Courier)andM;Microsoft's handling of its acquisition of Consumers Software is differentfrom the Lotus/cc: Mail relationship.andP;  Consumers Software has ceased to existunder that name, and is now Microsoft Workgroup Applications Canada.andO;Microsoft and Consumers Software had been working for over a year to addfunctionality to Network Courier, particularly in the area of Windows supportand application integration.andP;  The Network Courier-based line of products willnow be called Microsoft Mail for PPC Networks, to distinguish it from theMacintosh-based Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk.andP;  The first release under theMicrosoft name is Version 2.1, which has announced last month.andM;Microsoft Mail: StrategyandM;The acquisition has raised some immediate issues which Microsoft is nowaddressing.andP;  These include continued support and a free upgrade program forcurrent Network Courier users (a major focus for Microsoft), and theintegration of Consumers Software's direct sales force.andM;On the strategy level, Microsoft is working on implementing an architecturethat opens up the APIs into both the PC-based and Mac-based mail engines.andO;This will allow either one to be accessed by any application.andP;  In addition,either mail engine would have access to multiple network services such asfile, naming, and gateways (see &quot;Architecture and Directions&quot; below).andP;  Withthis strategy, mail becomes another service on the network; a service whichis available to both people and applications as clients, and to which all ofthe other services on the network are available.andM;Microsoft Mail (Network Courier)andM;Microsoft Mail:andM;Architecture andandM;DirectionsandM;The current Network Courier-based product allows clients on multipleplatforms (DOS, Windows, Macintosh, and OS/2) to access a common file of mailmessages that sits on a PC LAN file server.andP;  The server supports a globaldirectory service (with server-to-server Name Service propagation), andtransparent store-and-forward routing to other servers and other mail systemsthrough a set of gateways.andM;The product is designed to be easy to administer, particularly over a largenetwork.andM;DIRECTIONS.andP;  Microsoft's near-term vision is a client/server architecture,with multiple clients accessing the same mail services--United MessageStorage and Directory Services (see Illustration 3).andP;  Though Microsoft willcontinue to offer and enhance these services--as well as mail engine servicesand gateways--the company plans to move away from the focus on proprietaryproducts.andP;  Microsoft's strategy is to use and promote others' use ofMicrosoft's two messaging APIs.andP;  This will enable plug-and-play mail storage,name service, and gateways.andM;Microsoft's long-term vision is based on its concept of &quot;Windows Networking.&quot;andO;Windows Networking will provide a single API layer in the Windows client,which will provide access to fundamental network services.andP;  Mail would thusexist as a client application that would have access to the mail services.andO;In addition, it would have access to other available network services, whichcould range from printing to spell-checking to intelligent agents.andM;Microsoft Mail: The ProductandM;In general, the current Microsoft Mail product is mainstream, with little todistinguish it in either functionality or user interface.andP;  The strengths arein its gateway technologies, some inbox management--specially hierarchicalfolders--and its enterprise-wide management capabilities.andP;  The advancedmanagement and administration capabilities, such as batch file addition ofusers and cost-based routing, are particularly strong vis-a-vis its LAN-basedcompetitors.andM;Platforms andandM;InterconnectivityandM;The Network Courier acquisitions gives Microsoft client software for DOS,Windows, OS/2, and Macintosh, all of which can access the PC LAN-basedserver.andP;  While enhancing the Windows version is the first priority, Microsoftplans to deliver Version 2.1 on the other platforms this year, and possiblyadd a Unix client.andP;  Microsoft plans to continue to support and enhance boththe PC-based and Mac-based mail engines.andP;  Over time, Microsoft would like tohave any client be able to access either mail service.andM;According to Microsoft, a primary reason for its acquisition of NetworkCourier technology is its strong set of gateways, which were developedinternally by Consumers Software.andP;  Microsoft points out, as an example, thatthe X.400 gateway does not require a Retix or Touch server as do competitiveproducts, and is thus less expensive for the customer to implement.andP;  Inaddition to X.400, Microsoft offers gateways to MCI, SMTP, PROFS and SNADS,MHS, and fax.andM;Application IntegrationandM;Before the Microsoft acquisition, the Network Courier product had just openedup its file-based APIs.andP;  The current offering includes two primary APIs: thegateway File Format API (FFAPI) and the application File Format API.andM;The gateway FFAPI basically enables mail to be exchanged with other systems.andO;It has three components:andM;* An administration programandM;* An extraction program that converts mail from a Microsoft Mail post officeinto its own Network Courier File Format (NCFF)andM;* A program that converts an NCFF file into a post office messageandM;These utilities can be spawned either directly from the command line or by adriver program.andP;  A foreign mail system or application would need counterpartsto these three utilities to translate data back and forth from the NCFF.andM;The application FFAPI has the same components as the gateway API.andP;  Athird-party application would use the application FFAPI as a transportmechanism for a networked application.andM;Over the next year or two, as part of its overall platform architecture (see&quot;Architecture and Directions&quot; above), Microsoft intends to create a new setof platform APIs that would enable direct access to the mail server.andP;  It isnot yet clear whether an interim set of programmatic APIs will be released.andM;USE OF DDE AND OLE.andP;  A future version of Microsoft Mail will support both DDEand OLE.andP;  However, DDE and OLE support do not appear in the recentlyintroduced Version 2.1andM;User InterfaceandM;The Windows interface is just that--Windows.andP;  It is very simple, clean, andfamiliar to users of Microsoft's Windows applications and utilities.andO;Functions are accessed by pull-down menus.andP;  The product has little of theflash and appeal of cc:Mail for Windows or the customizability ofWordPerfect's upcoming Windows product (see &quot;WordPerfect Office&quot; below).andM;While most of the user interaction features are at best average, the productdoes support message storage in hierarchical folders and private and publicfolders, the latter enabling simple conferening.andP;  The user can decide whichfield to sort messages by, and can change the field for each folder.andM;The name service is flexible, as users can also choose one of a number ofdirectories, including one or more personal directories, as the defaultdirectory.andM;Advanced FeaturesandM;CALENDAR/SCHEDULER.andP;  Microsoft does not provide a calendar/scheduler forWindows, other than the very simple Windows Calendar utility.andP;  Microsoft hasjust announced Scheduler+ for the Macintosh, which runs on top of Microsoft'sApple Talk-based mail product.andP;  We expect that Microsoft will introducescheduling functionality onto the Windows platform as soon as possible.andP;  Thecompany views it as a key component of desktop office functionality.andM;FILTERING.andP;  Microsoft does not have immediate plans to provide electronicmail filters.andP;  Microsoft's view is that, in the long run, filters and agentsshould be available as a system-level service, accessed as an applicationcontrol language or cross-application macro facility.andP;  This view does notpreclude Microsoft's introducing mail filtering as a tactical productenhancement before the system-level services are in place.andP;  In fact, we thinkthat, to keep up with the emerging mail filtering products, Microsoft willdevelop mail filtering for both its Mac-based and Windows-based mailproducts.andM;MULTIMEDIA.andP;  Microsoft is relying on third parties to build multimediaapplications to its Windows extensions specifications.andP;  Because Microsoftalso expects tha these applications will support OLE, future versions ofMicrosoft Mail will enable messages to have multimedia documents embeddedright in them.andP;  It is also certain that Microsoft will directly supportmultimedia devices that conform to its specifications in the future mailproducts.andM;ENHANCED REMOTE DELIVERY.andP;  Microsoft currently has not committed to any ofthe newer options, though it does find cellular delivery interesting.andM;ALTERNATE COMPUTING DEVICES.andP;  Microsoft is putting a lot of emphasis onPen-Windows as the pen-based computing environment of choice.andP;  Microsoftplans to have Pen-Windows support existing Windows applications.andP;  Even ifthis ends up bieng less smooth than Microsoft predicts, we weill certainlysee a Microsoft Mail product for pen-based machines very early on.andP;  In fact,it is likely that Microsoft Mail will be bundled in with some pen-basedmachines.andM;WordPerfect OfficeandM;WordPerfect likes to think of itself as the &quot;sleeping giant&quot; of the E-mailbusiness.andP;  WordPerfect Office, its office productivity and electronic mailpackage, boasts over 250,000 individual nodes and $ 12 million in sales, andbrings in the second largest revenue of the products in the WordPerfect line.andO;Currently, the vast majority of WordPerfect Office sales are in corporationsthat have standardized on WordPerfect as their word processor.andM;WordPerfect Office:andM;StrategyandM;WordPerfect originally looked at WordPerfect Office as the means by whichWordPerfect users communicate and exchange documents.andP;  However, because itwas built on WordPerfect Library (which was essentially as DOS shell and aset of productivity tools including personal calendar), at introduction,WordPerfect Office was already much more than an electronic mail package.andO;With its Shell, File Manager, Notebook, Macro facility, Calendar, Scheduler,etc., it was the first complete LAN-based office system (see Vol.andP;  12, No.andO;5, for a complete examination of the product).andM;WordPerfect has now extended its view of the role of Office even further,seeing it at the center of application-to-application interaction as well aspeople-to-people communication.andP;  To enable this interaction, WordPerfect isdesigning its own applications architecture based on its WordPerfect Officeand WordPerfect Connections products (see &quot;Architecture and Directions&quot;below).andP;  This architecture should become a reality in 1992--the company plansto use the rest of 1991 to get all of its platforms up to a level that cantake advantage of the new architecture.andP;  WordPerfect plans to open up thisarchitecture to third parties who want to integrate with its applications andservices.andP;  The company is betting that the popularity of its word processorand the functionality of its office services will entice a large number ofthird-party applications to be written to its specifications.andP;  Ultimately,WordPerfect hopes that these specifications will become to de facto standardfor desktop applications--sort of the MHS of application-to-applicationcommunication.andM;WordPerfect Office:andM;Architecture andandM;DirectionsandM;Currently, the mail post office resides on the WordPerfect Office Lan Host,any file server in the network.andP;  WordPerfect Connections, a separate process,serves as a post office router for networks with multiple post offices andfor access to remote networks.andM;The name service resides on the Office LAN host, and is local to each domain.andO;WordPerfect plans to introduce name service replication across domains inJuly.andP;  WordPerfect's goal is to be able to use the native namingservice--StreetTalk, NetWare Name Service (NNS), etc.--for both local andremote directory services.andM;Another thrust for WordPerfect, both in terms of Office and all its otherproducts, is to improve and enhance system administration above the domainlevel.andM;WordPerfect is also working on improved remote access.andP;  The new capabilities,which allow a DOS machine or Mac to access the DOS, Mac, Unix, or VMSmailbox, shoudl be available by the third or fourth quarter.andM;STRATEGY FOR 1992.andP;  While WordPerfect is devoting 1991 to upgrading anddelivering all of its clients so that they will be able to play in adistributed environment, the company plans 1992 as the year when it deliversits own integration architecture as the foundation for distributed services.andO;Built on the WordPerfect Connections server, these services will be availableto its own applications and those of third parties writing to the APIs.andP;  Themessaging system will reside at the session and presentation layers and willprovide the pipes for applications to talk to each other.andP;  WordPerfect plansto build this on an RPC or Sockets interface (see Illustration 5).andM;The architecture will provide several sets of APIs, including one on theclient side that will enable queries from client applications, and adistributed server API that will enable servers to register theiravailability for applications.andP;  The architecture will be initiallyimplemented on Novell NetWare, with Banyan, LAN Manager, TCP/IP, AppleTalk,and other implementations to follow &quot;as market shar dictates.&quot;andM;The Client Services are built on the native network transport protocols andnetwork services, such as IPX, NETBIOS, and File Copy.andP;  Applications may bewritten directly to the network services (as they are today) or to either theWordPerfect 3rd Party Toolkit or a new WordPerfect Network Interface API.andO;This API will connect to the Connections Server, riding over existinginterprocess communications interfaces such as RPCs, sockets and pipes.andM;The Connections Server will enable the server side of a distributedapplication to be written to a Distributed Service Interface API, which willlink into WordPerfect's Connection Management System.andP;  The ConnectionsManagement System will function as an object manager, binding applications tonetwork services, including the Directory Service, which will be built onWordPerfect's internally developed, semi-object-oriented FLAIM database.andO;These services will all run over multiple network protocols and file systems.andM;WordPerfect Office: The ProductandM;WordPerfect Office for Windows is due to ship in the fourth quarter of 1991.andO;For the Windows version, the Shell, which enables hot-keying between DOSapplications, has been abandoned in favor of direct access to thefunctionality from the Windows Program Manager.andP;  The modules of the Windowsproduct are Mail, Calendar (which includes group scheduling), Notebook, andFile Manager.andM;Platforms andandM;InterconnectivityandM;WordPerfect Office had its origins as a multiplatform product.andP;  it iscurrently available on DOS, Digital VMS, Unix, and Data General, and willsoon be released on Macintosh (now due June or July 1991) and Windows (due inthe fourth quarter of this year).andP;  WordPerfect is also planning to releasethe product in 1992 for VM, MVS, and OS/400 to directly compete withOfficeVision.andM;Once all of the releases reach Version 3--scheduled for this manner--all ofthe mail systems will interconnect and users will be able to schedulemeetings across systems.andP;  We are not aware of any other calendar/schedulerthat supports this.andM;In the same way, WordPerfect Office's gateways will support both mail andcalendar/scheduler.andP;  For example, the PROFS gateway, due out in June, willsupport cross-scheduling between WordPerfect Office and PROFS users.andP;  Thecurrently available gateways include MHS, ATandamp;T EasyLink, MCI, and an asynchgateway used for dial-up between WordPerfect Office installations.andP;  Inaddition to the PROFS gateway, other gateways due this year include X.400 (tothe Retix server), SNADS, SMTP (the Unix-based Simple Message TransportProtocol), Digital's MailBus and VAXmail, Soft*Switch, and outgoing fax.andO;WordPerfect is also looking at gateways to cc:Mail, Lotus Notes, Banyan'sMail, 3Com's mail, and full tax support.andM;WordPerfect has designed its gateways to allow full pass-through ofWordPerfect Office capabilities.andP;  Thus, two WordPerfect Office sites could beconnected through Soft*Switch, MCI, or ATandamp;T for example, and not lose anyfunctionality.andM;Application IntegrationandM;Version 3.1 (due in the fourth quarter) will build in a large number ofviewers and launchers.andP;  Currently, WordPerfect has defined file-based APIs tothe WordPerfect Office modules into the WordPerfect Toolkit.andP;  WordPerfectalso offers a gateway API into the Connections Server.andP;  The APIs toWordPerfect Office will be opened up with the new WordPerfect Connectionsarchitecture due in 1992 (see &quot;Architecture and Directions&quot; above).andM;USE OF DDE AND OLE.andP;  WordPerfect is one of the companies that has committedto DDE and OLE for all of its Windows products.andP;  The initial WordPerfectOffice for Windows product will support DDE and OLE.andM;User InterfaceandM;Though the interface for the Windows version of WordPerfect Office has notyet been finalized, WordPerfect intends to offer some of the flexibilityfeatures that it has demonstrated in previews of the WordPerfect for Windowsproduct.andP;  The most notable of these is the ability for the user to assign anymenu function or macro to a &quot;button.&quot;andP;  The buttons, actually icons and/ortext (the user can choose how the buttons are displayed), are groupedtogether in a button bar that can be positioned on the left, right, bottom,or top of the screen.andM;The user can also configure the inbox by dragging the headings (Sender, Date,Subject, etc.) and placing them at any desired location.andM;The strongest element of the current interface is the outbox, where users cansee the full status of their sent messages, including whether and when themessage is read and deleted.andP;  Users can also recall any unopened message fromthe recipient's mailbox, an &quot;oops&quot; feature that many users come to appreciategreatly.andM;Inbox handling is not as strong, though the DOS Version 3.1, which is due outlate this year, as well as the Windows and Mac versions, will enhance users'ability to manage their inboxes by providing support for multiple folders.andM;Advanced FeaturesandM;CALENDAR/SCHEDULER.andP;  WordPerfect Office provides the strongest (and onlycross-platform) group-scheduling function.andP;  Scheduler is a separate modulethat is integrated with the highly functional personal calendar.andP;  WordPerfectis working on fully integrating the two modules into one.andM;FILTERING.andP;  Neither the current nor this year's planned releases supportfiltering.andP;  The Mac version has its own forms editor, which will be veryuseful in creating filterable message types once filters are added to theproduct.andP;  We would like to see the forms creation on the other platforms assoon as possible.andM;MULTIMEDIA.andP;  The Mac version currently supports voice annotation.andO;WordPerfect is waiting for standard voice support on the Windows platform.andM;ALTERNATE COMPUTING PLATFORMS.andP;  WordPerfect is interested in the pen-basedcomputing systems both for mail and word processing.andP;  The company is likelyto develop a word processing application first and then look at mail andOffice functionality.andP;  WordPerfect is developing interfaces to the SharpWizard and Seiko Watch to enable upload and download of Calendar and Notebook(rolodex).andM;Long Shot Entries May Lead the WayandM;While Lotus, Microsoft, and WordPerfect threaten to dominate the E-mailmarket, other companies are introducing interesting mail products that willvie for market share.andP;  These products will be among the first to demonstratesome of the advanced integration and functionality that will become standardover the coming generations of the market leaders' products.andM;DaVinci: Support for DDEandM;and OLEandM;eMail from DaVinci Systems (Raleigh, North Carolina) is the firstWindows-based mail package to deliver DDE support, with OLE support to beadded in the next release.andP;  eMail functions as a client in an MHS network.andM;Beyond: Rules-BasedandM;FilteringandM;Beyond (Cambridge, Massachusetts) has announced and is demonstrating bothWindows and DOS mail clients that implement advanced rules-based filtering.andO;The product will run on the local mail transports, with the first releasescheduled to run over MHS.andP;  (See Vol.andP;  13, No.andP;  11, for a full discussion ofmail filtering and a discription of the Beyond product and strategy.)andM;Reach: Preparing forandM;WorkflowandM;Reach Software (Sunnyvale, California) has just announced MailMan,Windows-based client software to run over multiple mail systems, with thefirst implementation to support Banyan's mail on VINES.andP;  MailMan, Reach'sfirst product, is not only an open mail client, but it is also designed asthe front end for a forms-based workflow application builder.andM;ConclusionandM;Lotus, Microsoft, and WordPerfect are now offering their own comprehensiveelectronic mail solutions, and, for the most part, the products arecomprehensive, if not revolutionary.andP;  Though the companies have reached thispoint in different ways--Lotus and Microsoft by acquisition, WordPerfect byinternal development--they find themselves in remarkably similar positions.andO;Each is now in position to enable developers to build sophisticated,multiplatform, workgroup applications atop its mail system.andP;  Each is also inposition to offer users a comprehensive suite of office applications thatmake up the better part of what we used to call the integrated office system.andO;Right now, the battle is to get users and developers to buy into mail.andP;  Butsoon the arena will shift to the office as a whole, with mail as the enablerfor the Windows Office.andP;  Stay tuned.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
