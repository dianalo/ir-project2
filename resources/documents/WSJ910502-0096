But bankers and economists cautioned that the economicimpact would be slight because businesses are still reluctantto borrow and banks are not seen passing much of the lowercost of their funds to consumers.</LP><TEXT>   J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. was the first off the mark with anannouncement that crossed the financial wires at about 9:30a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, followed within minutes by FirstChicago Corp., Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp., and,throughout the morning, by more than half a dozen other majorbanks.   It was the third time since late December that banks havematched a one-half percentage point decline in the discountrate, which banks pay the Fed for borrowing at its window.   But the banks were more in the spotlight this time to dosomething given their reluctance to lower the prime in recentmonths despite the steady slide in rates they pay for theirfunds. Also prompting them was the signal sent by the FedTuesday that it had set a lower target for the federal fundsrate, a more important barometer of bank borrowing costs.   &quot;The banks would have been embarassed not to follow suit,especially with bank reform proposals under discussion inWashington,&quot; said Gail Fosler, chief economist for theConference Board. But she does not see a surge in businessborrowing, in part she said because BankAmerica Corp.'s Bankof America unit did not gain market share when it alone had alower prime rate for nearly two months before it returned tothe higher level last week. Bank of America followed theother banks late yesterday in cutting its prime rate.   A lower prime directly affects small and medium-sizedbusinesses that borrow at that rate and some consumers whoseadjustable-rate home equity loans are pegged to the prime.Larger businesses that borrow at a spread over the Londoninterbank offered rate will benefit indirectly because alower federal funds rate, which prompted the move on theprime, tends to bring down the London interbank rate as well.   For business borrowers, concern over the economy willcontinue to inhibit expansion, say bankers and economists. &quot;Adecrease of half a percentage point or even a full percentage{point} will not make businesses come in and borrow money atthis time,&quot; said Frank Lourenso, executive vice president incharge of lending to middle market corporate customers forChemical Banking Corp. &quot;The overwhelming majority of ourcustomer base still feels this is a recession that will behere for a while.&quot; Chemical, which lowered its prime rateyesterday, is the largest lender in the New York area tobusinesses with less than $250 million in annual revenue.   &quot;I don't see a lower prime driving businesses back toborrow,&quot; said Erich Heinemann, chief ecnommist at Ladenburg,Thalman andamp; Co. More significant, he said, is that the Fed isnow targeting a lower federal funds rate, which should helpto &quot;create money and lead the economy out of recession.&quot;James McDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods, a bankresearch firm, said that while he is not looking for adramatic impact near term, &quot;my sense is that lower rates willstimulate more borrowing in the second half.&quot; Mr. McDermottsaid that by lowering the prime the banks will reduce theirnet interest margins slightly in the current quarter whilefed funds remain at current levels.   But banks are not likely to pass the lower cost of fundsonto consumers in the form of lower credit-card rates orpersonal-loan rates, the analysts say. &quot;Faced with risingdelinquency rates in cards and mortgages, I don't see muchchange in consumer loan rates,&quot; said Mr. McDermott.   The consumer, in fact, is probably the loser in thecurrent lower rate environment. That's because, Mr. Heinemannsaid, consumers deposit more funds in banks than they borrowand the rates they receive on certificates of deposit arefalling while borrowing costs are staying high. Typically, acut in the prime rate of half a percentage point is followedby a reduction of 0.25% to 0.33% in certificates-of-depositrates over the next four to six weeks, said Robert Heady,president of Bank Rate Monitor.   Banks are also seen keeping the spread between borrowingcosts and lending rates extraordinarily high because of theextra profit pressure they could be under from a specialassessment to replenish the bank insurance fund. &quot;Thepossibility of a special assessment remains a concernoverhanging earnings,&quot; said Allerton Smith, vice president inbank research at CS First Boston Corp.   John McCoy, chairman of Banc One Corp., Columbus, Ohio,disagrees with the notion that consumers won't benefit. &quot;Theprime is an indicator and indirectly it will put pressure onbanks to lower rates for auto loans, credit cards andmortgages.&quot; He said the changes will occur in part because&quot;You haven't seen much lowering of rates lately.&quot;   While there may be a debate over the impact of a lowerprime, Gordon Richards, an economist with the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers, is convinced that it will bethe general movement now under way toward lower short-terminterest rates that will boost the economy. In particular, hesaid lower Treasury bill rates are helping to lower thedollar, which will eventually stimulate exports. &quot;Lowerinterest rates are taking the wind out of the sails ofspeculators pushing the dollar up,&quot; he said.   Like others, Ms. Fosler of the Conference Board is notrelying on more business borrowing because few of the signsthat companies need money are evident and because thosecompanies that do want to borrow are often turned away bybanks. &quot;Given the stance of banks to be risk averse interestrates may not be the useful measure of how easy credit is,&quot;she said.   &quot;My biggest hope for a recovery is in the housing area,&quot;Ms. Fosler added. But long-term interest rates, which are thekey to lower costs of mortgages, have come down very little.The key question now, she said, is &quot;can lower short ratesinspire lower long rates?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
