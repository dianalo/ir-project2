The U.S. Sentencing Commission, an independent agencywithin the judicial branch, said in a report to Congress thatin practice, mandatory minimum statutes are rarely used toproduce convictions and aren't consistently applied when theyare.</LP><TEXT>   Sweeping anti-crime legislation passed by the Senate andnow under consideration in the House would create a varietyof new mandatory minimum sentences.   A central justification for mandatory-minimum laws is toensure that criminals will be punished sternly and uniformly.But the sentencing commission reported that the statutesproduce &quot;sharply different sentences based upon small,relatively arbitrary differences in offense conduct or priorcriminal record.&quot;   For example, the commission noted, in federal court, &quot;adefendant possessing 5.01 grams of crack {cocaine} must besentenced to a five-year prison term, but a defendantpossessing 5.0 grams cannot be sentenced to more than oneyear in prison.&quot;   Moreover, the commission found, &quot;Of the more than 60criminal statutes containing mandatory minimum penaltiesapplicable to federal offenses in the federal criminal codetoday, only four frequently result in convictions.&quot; Onereason for this is that prosecutors and defense lawyers avoidmandatory minimum sentences in plea bargaining.</TEXT></DOC>
