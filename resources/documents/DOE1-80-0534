Case study was conducted usinga 600 kW practical plant which seems very feasible. Kume Island, OkinawaPref. was selected as the place of plant installation considering thatthe seawater there gives a sufficient thermal difference during the wholeyear and that the mild oceanologic and meteorologic conditions thereare relatively mild. Computation for system optimization, optimum systemoperation, and system performance was conducted. Also, economic evaluationwas performed. Ocean thermal energy conversion is costly in power generationsystem construction, but is comparable to conventional power generationschemes because fuel expenditure is zero. This method will be feasiblein the near future; however, adequate verification using a practicalplant is necessary before constructing a full-scale plant. (21 figs,2 tabs, 4 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
