Assets of 128 institutional funds rose $909 million to $70.51 billion.    The increase is the highest one-week rise since Aug. 17, when assets increased $3.1 billion to $268.7 billion. There has been no real asset-level trend since that increase, with net assets about where they were in late August. </TEXT></DOC>
