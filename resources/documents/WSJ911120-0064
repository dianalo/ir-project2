The companies said they intend to reacha definitive agreement by Jan. 31.   A memorandum of understanding signed by both companiescould be the first step in an Asian-backed consortium thatMcDonnell Douglas hopes to create to breathe new life intoits commercial airliner operations. The intent, Mr. McDonnellsaid, is to try to &quot;leapfrog&quot; rivals Boeing Co. and AirbusIndustrie, a European consortium.   Under terms of the agreement, McDonnell Douglas would spinoff its existing commercial aircraft division. Facilities inboth the U.S. and Taiwan would house work on McDonnellDouglas's new widebody airliner, the MD-12. The $4 billionjet development program would be funded primarily by cashdrawn from McDonnell Douglas's existing aircraft lines, theMD-11 and MD-80; the money from abroad would be used to paydown the company's $2.7 billion in debt.   Although majority controlled by St. Louis-based McDonnellDouglas, the as-yet unnamed new company would have its ownboard of directors. Its exact structure hasn't beendetermined.   Mr. McDonnell said he doesn't plan to sell stock in thenew company on the public markets. But he said TaiwanAerospace might adjust its stake so that other companiescould buy in.   Mr. McDonnell said that assuming the Taiwan transaction iscompleted, &quot;I'd still like to get one or two or three others&quot;to become holders in the new concern. He declined to bespecific, but industry officials have said entities inSingapore, South Korea and Indonesia are possibilites.   Japanese manufacturers haven't been as high on the list,apparently because their costs are greater and a deal withthem might spark political backlash. But one industryofficial said the Japanese have come up with a low-costproduction plan to build aircraft parts in South America.Some companies, both in Asia and other regions, may alsobecome risk-sharing subcontractors on just the MD-12 program.   Mr. McDonnell made clear that the company is determined toget help from abroad. Should the Taiwan deal collapse, theexecutive said, &quot;we'd have to look&quot; for another major equitypartner. The signing of the tentative agreement with TaiwanAerospace will lead to at least 10 weeks of finalnegotiations, and still requires government approvals in theU.S. and Taiwan.   Mr. McDonnell emphasized that the new arrangement isn't asign that McDonnell Douglas, the nation's largest defensecontractor, is giving up on its military business. Ifanything, the company will now be able to better focus onthose operations, while giving the Pentagon the confidencethat it has the financial wherewithal to remain a viablecontractor, the executive said.   Should McDonnell Douglas succeed in forming atrans-Pacific consortium, many analysts believe thearrangement could provide the company with the means totransform itself from the weakest of the world's Big Threejetliner producers into a major force with low-costmanufacturing, access to the growing Pacific Rim market and asorely needed cash infusion.   Mr. McDonnell said his goal is to have feeder operationsin Asia send airplane components to a factory in Taiwan,which would fabricate and form them into still larger parts.The Tawian plant, in turn, would send the components to a newfactory in the U.S. where MD-12s would be assembled andtested.   The preliminary agreement with Taiwan Aerospace capsmonths of behind-the-scenes talks and three trips to the FarEast by Mr. McDonnell.   For weeks, company executives have been busily phoningcustomers, suppliers and U.S. government officials so that noone would be blindsided by the signing.   Still, some have expressed reservations. Lawmakers,including Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D., N.M.), have said they'reworried about the possible transfer abroad of U.S. technicalexpertise. &quot;I hope we can find an alternative that willpreserve American equity ownership of McDonnell Douglas,&quot; thesenator said in a letter yesterday to President Bush. At acongressional hearing yesterday, a Treasury Departmentofficial indicated his agency would look into whether thedeal could be harmful to U.S. strategic interests. Mr.McDonnell called the criticism a &quot;non-issue.&quot;   Mr. McDonnell also said that while the Taiwan governmentwould likely take a large equity position either directly orindirectly in the new company, McDonnell Douglas remainscommitted to fighting Airbus over the subsidies it hasreceived from European governments. One Airbus executive,David Venz, said last week that &quot;government support isgovernment support no matter how you slice it.&quot; But Mr.McDonnell said that in his view Taiwan will be making &quot;aneconomic investment subject to market disciplines.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
