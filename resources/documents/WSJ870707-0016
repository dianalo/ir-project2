Technical factors and signs of tightness in the supply of North Sea Brent, an abundantly traded European crude blend, also helped fuel gains in Europe and the U.S., traders said.    An early oil-buying bout in U.S. futures markets stemmed from continuing signs Iran has boosted its defenses around the Persian Gulf, traders said.    &quot;Geopolitical forces continue to affect the market,&quot; said a Florida-based trader.    At the opening on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for August delivery shot above the contract's previous high of $20.70 a barrel. It closed at $20.93, up 32 cents and one cent below the day's high. It was the seventh oil-price advance in the past nine sessions.    &quot;We went right through and never looked back,&quot; said Rick Donovan, head of the international energy department at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. in New York. &quot;The market looks strong.&quot;    On the spot, or noncontract, market, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, rose 35 cents, to $20.95. July Brent edged up five cents a barrel, to $19.35 in late trading.    Some of yesterday's strength was attributable to chart-guided technical buying, some brokers said. Traders who follow price-trend charts, for instance, said they considered it bullish that prices broke through $20.70, which twice in recent weeks was the high for the August contract.    &quot;What was difficult to get through on the way up will now be difficult to get through on the way down,&quot; said Eric Bolling, vice president for futures and options at Geldermann Inc. in New York.    Analysts said some early buying also stemmed from signs several major oil companies soon may sign long-term contracts to buy oil from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.    That reflects optimism among some in the oil industry that prices will firm, the analysts said.    A report from OPECNA, the OPEC news agency, quoted Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, as saying that the cartel has been getting requests to sign long-term contracts for OPEC oil at current market prices, said Nauman Barakat, energy futures analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York.    Still, some analysts cautioned that prices could soon decline if the Middle East tensions abate a bit.    &quot;If it quiets down, we could see a drop of $1 quite quickly off the price&quot; of U.S. oil, said Ian Gibson, vice president at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities in New York.    &quot;But we feel that would just be an opportunity to buy,&quot; Mr. Gibson said, adding that Kleinwort expects firmer oil prices for the second half of the year.    In other futures markets yesterday:    COPPER: Futures prices rose for the fourth consecutive session amid a decline in exchange stockpiles and continued tightness in world supplies, traders said. Weekly copper inventories at the London Metal Exchange fell about 2.4%, to 104,025 metric tons, analysts said, while daily warehouse copper stockpiles at the Commodity Exchange in New York fell 3%, to 63,073 U.S. short tons. A metric ton equals 1.1 U.S. short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds. July copper on the Comex rose 0.95 cent a pound to 75.8 cents. Since last Tuesday, the July contract has risen five cents, or 7%. Much of the interest in the futures market continues to come from commodity funds, or pools of professionally managed money, traders and brokers said. Meanwhile, strong consumption is keeping supplies tight. At the end of last month world supplies were equal to about 4.3 weeks of consumption, compared with typical equilibrium levels of about seven to eight weeks, analysts said. The tightness &quot;is not going to abate any time soon,&quot; said Frederick Demler, metals economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.    COFFEE: July futures prices sank to a six-year low of $1 a pound because of technical factors and expectations of high Brazilian production, traders and analysts said. On the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in New York, the July contract, after briefly touching $1, closed at $1.0017 a pound, down 3.43 cents for the day. The last time prices closed lower was Aug. 31, 1981, when they stood at 99.9 cents. Strong technical selling was spurred when prices fell below the contract's previous low of $1.006, traders said. Signs that Brazil, the world's largest producer, will have a huge crop led to additional declines, a New York trader said. Although Brazil is prone to frost through the end of August, &quot;all forecasts are calling for smooth sailingthere's sunbathing on the beaches,&quot; said Bernard Savaiko, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York. And a New York trader who expects further price declines said, &quot;The big picture is that there's just too much coffee around.&quot;    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Futures prices were mixed, as gains in the dollar over the U.S. holiday weekend led to lower prices yesterday for futures on the Japanese yen, West German mark and Swiss franc. The strength in the dollar came largely in response to Friday's news that Japan's trade surplus fell in May, said Anne Parker Mills, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. Some view that as a sign that there is no need for the dollar to go lower to correct trade imbalances between Japan and the U.S. Futures on the Canadian dollar and British pound rose. The Canadian dollar often follows moves in the U.S. currency, while higher oil prices helped boost sterling, analysts said.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat futures prices ended higher amid news of subsidies for wheat sales to Poland and Morocco. Corn prices were lower, however. While corn is in its critical pollination period and vulnerable to scorching temperatures, weekend weather conditions throughout much of the Midwest were favorable for the crop-curbing expectations of drought damage. A late rally helped soybeans finish higher. Soybean meal was also higher, but soybean oil was mixed. </TEXT></DOC>
