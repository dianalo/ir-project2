Barbara Roberts has signed into law a measure to permit thesacramental use of peyote by American Indians. &quot;This is not a drug issue. Thisis a freedom of religion issue,&quot; Roberts said Monday in Salem. At thebill-signing were Alfred Smith and Galen Black, who were fired in 1982 as drugcounselors for using the hallucinogen in Indian ceremonies. The state deniedthem unemployment compensation, and the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court,which ruled in the state's favor last year. Sacramental use of peyote ispermitted by the federal government and some other states.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  OREGON LAW ALLOWS PEYOTE IN SACRAMENTS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  National News in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910625  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  104  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday June 25, 199100177141,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
