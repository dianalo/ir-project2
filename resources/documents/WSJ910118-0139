The bankers say any recentcentral-bank actions haven't been out of character with thebank's policy since about 1987 of diversifyingforeign-exchange deposits, though they say the shifts mayhave accelerated slightly.</LP><TEXT>   The Central Bank of China's policy regarding deposits fromits $73 billion of foreign-exchange reserves in U.S.commercial banks has been scrutinized in recent days becauseof an erroneous report that the bank withdrew about $35billion from U.S. financial institutions in late 1990.   Samuel Shieh, central-bank governor, declined as a matterof policy to discuss details of the bank's depositactivities. But he said, &quot;We still have confidence in theU.S. economy. Some people incorrectly try to correlate ourroutine banking operations with our confidence in the U.S.economy.&quot;   Mr. Shieh said the central bank will continue holdingdeposits in U.S. commercial banks, though, like any othercentral bank, it carefully studies credit reports aboutindividual institutions. Mr. Shieh said that any shifts indeposits are part of a policy begun about four years ago todiversify the central bank's foreign-exchange holdings byspreading them among a greater number of banks and in a widerrange of currencies. At the time, foreign-exchange holdingstotaled between $20 billion and $30 billion and were about90%-denominated in the U.S. currency.   He said the bank continues to hold between $25 billion and$26 billion in U.S. commercial banks and the U.S. FederalReserve, although he wouldn't say how much was in commercialbanks and whether any shifts occurred recently. Taiwan nowhas about 32% of its foreign reserves in the U.S. bankingsystem, he said, while overall global U.S.-dollar holdingsrepresent about 58% to 60% of foreign-exchange holdings.Bankers in Hong Kong say there has been an increase inTaiwan's holdings of yen and marks, in particular.   Some U.S. bankers said the process of diversification,shifting deposits out of the U.S. commercial banks, may haveaccelerated slightly in recent months because of fears abouta Middle East war, instability in some U.S. banks andrecession. The bulk of that money has gone to the FederalReserve, they said. But the bankers dismissed news reportsearlier this week about large-scale shifts of deposits.   Foreign bankers in Hong Kong, where many U.S. banks havetheir regional headquarters, say there have been no signsanywhere in the region of a shift of deposits away from U.S.banks.   The head of another U.S. bank in Hong Kong said Taiwan'sforeign-exchange reserves, like the Asian financial markets,are more fluid now than they were a few years ago. &quot;Movementis to be expected from time to time. But {the U.S.} isTaiwan's closest ally on earth and they wouldn't do anythingto hurt our banks.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
