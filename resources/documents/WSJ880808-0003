As a result, the report is likely to do little to allay fears that inflation may accelerate in the coming months. The Federal Reserve and many private economists contend the economy needs to slow in the second half of the year to avoid rekindling inflation.    The rise in the rate, from June's 14-year low of 5.3%, was accompanied by a solid 283,000-job increase in nonfarm payroll employment and a big revision in the June increase to 532,000 from 346,000, the Labor Department said. Manufacturing employment rose 68,000 after a 55,000 increase in June.    Separately, the Fed said consumer credit rose at a strong 10.2% annual rate in June after the revised 5.7% pace in May.    &quot;The economy is strong -- perhaps too strong,&quot; said Donald Ratajczak, director of Georgia State University's forecasting project.    Jack Beebe, research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said, &quot;Based on the employment figures, I certainly don't see any indication that third-quarter growth will be significantly below the second quarter.&quot;    Despite the inflation fears, however, the strong increases in payrolls will be welcome news for the Republican Party. The jump in factory jobs shows the economy continues to benefit from strong export growth. In addition, the services sector, which provides work for three out of four nonfarm workers, saw a strong increase of 201,000 jobs in July.    Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the president's council of economic advisers, said the report suggests the &quot;rate of expansion continues to taper toward a sustainable long-term growth rate&quot; and doesn't indicate &quot;an acceleration in demand pressure which could reignite serious inflationary pressures.    &quot;Some say we're heading for the moon, but I don't see the evidence,&quot; he said.    Two inflation measures in the report did show an increase, however. Average hourly earnings moved up to $9.32 from $9.28 in June, while the department's hourly earnings index, which excludes wage changes caused by factory overtime and shift differentials, rose to 179.5% of its 1977 average from 178.6% in both June and May.    The average workweek edged up to 34.9 hours in July from 34.7 hours in June.    The department also reported that in its survey of households, employment increased 41,000 in July after increasing 823,000 in June. The household survey is used in calculating the unemployment rate.    Different accounting methods could be responsible for the huge discrepancy between the surveys, the department said. The household survey counts each employed person once, while the payroll survey counts the number of jobs held by a person. But the sample in the payroll survey is much larger, and it is usually considered the more accurate.    The Fed's consumer credit report showed a sharp increase in June of $5.43 billion after a $2.98 billion rise in May, with auto credit outstanding expanding $2.42 billion, following an increase of $851 million in May.    Revolving credit, which includes retail and bank-card borrowing, rose $2.85 billion after expanding $1.80 billion the month before. Mobile home credit declined $205 million, following a May decline of $61 million. Miscellaneous credit, including cash loans and retail financial contracts, rose $376 million after increasing $394 million in May.    At the end of June, the report said, consumer installment debt stood at $638.57 billion -- 9.1% above a year earlier.    The figures in both reports have been adjusted for seasonal variations. </TEXT></DOC>
