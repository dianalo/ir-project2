The ministers ended their first post-war meeting by adopting acommunique in which they also pledged to boost economiccooperation. Participating in the conference were Yugoslavia,Albania, Greece, Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria.   Relations among nearly all the Balkan nations are marked byethnic tensions. Albanian and Yugoslav relations have been strainedover the ethnic Albanian minority in the southern Yugoslav provinceof Kosovo.   The three-day conference was the highest-level meeting of Balkanstates since World War II, and the first international conferenceoutside the United Nations to be attended by an Albanian foreignminister.   It was also the first visit to Yugoslavia by an Albanian foreignminister since Belgrade broke with the Soviet bloc in 1948. Albaniabroke with the bloc in 1960.   Albania has been moving toward contact with other nations sincethe death in 1985 of its longtime leader Enver Hoxha, who keptAlbania virtually isolated from the rest of the world.   The adoption of the final document was delayed 9O-minutes afterAlbania raised objections to some aspects of the text. As the hostcountry, Yugoslavia drafted the final document.   Albanian Foreign Minister Reis Malile and his Yugoslavcounterpart Budimir Loncar left the conference hall to discuss thedisputed paragraphs.   Loncar, asked what Albania had objected to, said that itinvolved ``only a sequence of words and paragraphs.'' He refused tobe more specific.   The communique adopted by the conference encouraged morefrequent meetings among the Balkan leaders. The foreign ministersagreed to meet ``periodically,'' but did not set a date for theirnext conference.   Addressing the minority issue, the communique stated that ethnicminorities ``should be a factor of cohesion, stability, friendlyrelations and cooperation.''   The communique also emphasized the ``humanitarian aspect ofcooperation,'' an apparent reference to concerns of some statesover human rights abuses regarding their ethnic minorities inneighboring countries.   Bulgaria began a campaign in 1984 to change the names of itsestimated 1 million-strong ethnic Turkish minority. The campaignwas first reported by Turkish newspapers and later confirmed byWestern diplomats in Sofia and Amnesty International, theLondon-based human rights organization.   Albania has also accused Yugoslavia of discriminating againstits ethnic Albanian minority, and Greece has in the past expressedconcern about the Greek minority in Albania.</TEXT></DOC>
