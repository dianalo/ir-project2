The statement in the Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschlandwas one of the bluntest official assessments to date of thecountry's increasingly troubled situation. It came a day aftershouting matches broke out over German reunification duringpro-democracy protests in Leipzig and Dresden.   Also today, Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged cautionon the reunification issue. He visited the Berlin Wall and met withWest German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Premier HansModrow.   In another development, the largest opposition movement, NewForum, announced it will take part as a political party in thecountry's first free elections, scheduled for May 6.   Neues Deutschland, in proposing a new party platform, said``socialism has definitely failed as a social system in ourcountry'' and acknowledged that the ``popular revolutionarymovement'' of the past weeks had led to the scrapping of the oldsystem.   The paper repeated the Communists' promise to work for a new``democratic socialism'' within a multi-party system.   During the past few weeks, both Germanys have increased businessand cultural ties but have debated what labels to use for closerrelations, since the East Berlin government rejects calls forreunification.   Neues Deutschland urged a ``qualified partnership of both Germanstates'' but rejected any suggestions of resolving the ``Germanquestion.''   During Monday's demonstrations that drew more than 200,000protesters, the largest of them the now-weekly rally in thesouthern city of Leipzig, speakers warned that the reunificationissue could fracture the popular movement that has forced theruling Communists into swift retreat.   One sign said ``Germany United Fatherland,'' using a phrase fromthe West German national anthem.   Others, opposing reunification, urged ``No Fourth Reich'' and notransformation of East Germany into West Germany's ``plantation.''   ADN said 40,000 people demonstrated for reunification inKarl-Marx-Stadt, while several thousand people split into pro- andanti-reunification groups at a rally in Dresden.   Smaller rallies were also reported by ADN in Schwerin, Potsdam,Neubrandenburg and Halle. The agency did not say if reunificationplayed a role in those protests.   The rallies came shortly after the four victorious World War IIAllies met in West Berlin to discuss the latest developments inEast Germany and Berlin _ the divided city that they stilltechnically administer.   The meeting brought together officials of the United States,France and Britain with Soviet officials, who have increasinglyexpressed concern over calls in both Germanys to reunite thecountry.   Kohl has advocated a confederation of the two Germanys, to befollowed by eventual reunification. But he stressed to reporters onMonday that ``the goal of our policies is not to create anoverpowering Germany in the middle of Europe.'' The West Germanleader advocates a reunified Germany that would respect thesecurity needs _ and borders _ of the rest of Europe.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, during a CentralCommittee in Moscow on Saturday, urged the West not to try toinfluence developments in East Germany. East Germany is a frontline of defense for the Soviets, who have nearly 400,000 troops inthe country.   ADN said Gorbachev would meet soon with Gregor Gysi, a reformerwho was chosen East German Communist Party chief on Saturday.   Gysi's rise followed the ouster of two sets of Communistleaders. Since East Germans began agitating for an end to Communistdomination two months ago, public pressure has forced the openingof the Berlin Wall and pushed the Communists to promise freeelections and relinquish their political monopoly.</TEXT></DOC>
