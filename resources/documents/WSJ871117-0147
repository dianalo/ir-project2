He claims that the provision of the act allowing Congress to withdraw U.S. forces after 60 days without a vote is a &quot;political&quot; problem, and &quot;it is not constitutional.&quot; This is patent nonsense. The section described -- Section 5(b) -- is at the heart of the constitutional challenge to the act.    During times of hostilities, Section 5(b) would deprive the president of his constitutional authority as commander in chief after 60 days if Congress did nothing. Hostilities by U.S. forces could continue only if Congress voted affirmatively for their use. But without such a vote Congress can by silence or inaction strip the president of a fundamental constitutional power simply by doing nothing.    Moreover, Section 5(c) allows Congress to withdraw U.S. forces at any time by simply passing a concurrent resolution, which doesn't require the president's signature. As such, the resolution does not have the effect of law and is a blatant violation of the Constitution's presentation clause. I would think such constitutional chicanery would worry Mr. Zycher.    I think Mr. Zycher's confusion stems from the fact that he doesn't understand the president's authority as commander in chief. Mr. Zycher says that the &quot;Constitution explicitly gives . . . the president the authority to conduct a war once declared,&quot; but he says nothing about the president's power to use the military at other times, which is precisely the type of situation the War Powers Act addresses. The president should retain his constitutional power as commander in chief regardless of whether war is declared. That is the basic argument against the act's constitutionality.    The War Powers Act is unconstitutional because it violates the president's power as commander in chief, the presentation clause and the separation of powers. These are not &quot;political&quot; concerns, but very real and very dangerous constitutional violations. That is why I long ago sponsored legislation to repeal the War Powers Act and why I have also joined with other members of Congress in challenging its constitutionality in court.    Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R., Calif.) Washington </TEXT></DOC>
