Given the historical success oftime-temperature superposition, we have expanded this approach for combinedradiation-thermal environments, yielding an empirical time-temperature-doserate shifting procedure. The procedure derives an isothermal curve fora given amount of material damage versus dose rate at a selected referencetemperature by finding the Arrhenius activation energy that causes higher-temperaturedose-rate data to superpose when shifted to the reference temperature.The resulting superposed curve at the reference temperature expends tomuch lower dose rates that, in effect, are experimentally inaccessibledue to the long time periods which would be required. This proceduretherefore allows meaningful predictions to be made under long-term, low-doserate, radiation aging conditions. Using historical data from our radiation-agingprogram on nuclear power plant cable materials, we have successfullyapplied the time-temperature-dose rate superposition approach to fourdifferent materials. For two of these materials, extrapolated predictionsbased on the superposed data were found to be in excellent agreementwith 12-year, low-dose rate nuclear power plant results.</TEXT></DOC>
