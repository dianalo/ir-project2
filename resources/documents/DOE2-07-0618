The life of a fuelcell is affected by the performance degradation owing to a shortage ofphosphoric acid in an electrolyte of the cell. For improving this, asystem proposed is to supplement the phosphoric acid at the degradationof performance from outside. In this invention, it is carried out, inthe later stage of the fuel cell operation, by that the hydrogen in thereformed gas, an input into the main fuel body, is increased by reducingthe amount of water removed in the gas-water separator. In other words,when this steam concentration increases, phosphoric acid in the electrolyteis diluted by which the amount of the phosphoric acid entrained withthe reaction product and the reaction gas is restricted, thus reducingthe degradation of the performance.
