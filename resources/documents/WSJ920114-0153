He promised jobsand no new taxes.   Mr. Bush will be back here in Portsmouth tomorrow -- butCuzzin Richie's isn't on the itinerary. In the four yearssince his visit, the no-tax pledge has been broken, theeconomic boom has gone bust, Cuzzin Richie's itself is facingforeclosure, and the lunch-counter crowd has a beef with thepresident that won't be erased by photo opportunities.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;He does well as far as the foreign aid goes,&quot; grousesJack Brooking, a 48-year-old trucker. &quot;Right here, I don'tthink he knows too much what's going on. If Bush was one ofus, he'd do something about the people starving to death inthis country.&quot;   What's going on in New Hampshire -- as Mr. Bush willdiscover when he arrives in this venerable seacoast town --is a calamitous economic downturn that has spread fear andanxiety through households in every corner of the state.Pease Air Force Base, where the president will land,essentially shut down last year, taking 800 civilian and3,400 military jobs with it. The nearby Portsmouth NavalShipyard, where negotiators drafted the peace treaty thatended the Russo-Japanese War just after the turn of thecentury, has sliced 1,100 jobs in the past year, and thereare rumors of more layoffs to come. And in every day'snewspapers and newscasts, Mr. Bush gets blamed for economicdecline by GOP primary challenger Patrick Buchanan and theDemocratic presidential field.   &quot;If you were to pick a state to start the campaign in, itwould not be New Hampshire,&quot; says Republican Gov. Judd Gregg,the president's campaign chairman here.   New Hampshire and Mr. Bush have had a critical if erraticcourtship over the years. In 1980, his &quot;Big Mo&quot; following hisvictory in the Iowa caucuses was abruptly halted when RonaldReagan clobbered him here. Then came 1988, the no-new-taxespledge and the primary victory that smoothed his path to thepresidency.   Now, while nobody expects him to lose the GOP nomination,an unimpressive majority over Mr. Buchanan here would signala dangerous vulnerability in the general election. The latestNew Hampshire Poll, conducted last week by the AmericanResearch Group, showed the president leading by thelackluster margin of 46% to 30%.   As Mr. Bush prepares for an initial 12-hour foray here,Mr. Buchanan's guerrilla campaign -- helped by support fromthe ever-irascible, right-wing Manchester Union-Leader -- iscrisscrossing the state daily in a bid to harness voterdiscontent.   Last week's gimmick was a powerful rooftop searchlightthat Mr. Buchanan shined into the winter's night sky to mockthe president's absence during a 12-day trip to Asia. &quot;GeorgeBush seems to want to be president of the world, notpresident of the United States,&quot; Mr. Buchanan told a cable-TVinterviewer in Portsmouth.   But Mr. Buchanan's effort is a loosely organized,hit-or-miss affair. His pollster resigned last week in adispute over management and tactics. Though the TVcommentator is greeted effusively in shops and on streetcorners, it isn't clear how much that will translate into GOPvotes on Feb. 18. &quot;I've got a campaign slogan for you --`Wake up, George]'&quot; salesman Steve Chugg tells Mr. Buchanan,before allowing that he's a member of the state Democraticcommittee.   Mr. Bush's backers say the market for Mr. Buchanan's&quot;America First&quot; attacks on the administration's free-tradepolicies is limited in a state whose economy now dependsheavily on exports. Mr. Buchanan hasn't much at all to sayabout health care, another big issue here. Beyond a core ofperpetual malcontents and far-right conservatives -- fewerthan 20% of the GOP primary vote, by most estimates -- Mr.Buchanan will have trouble building a constituency, Gov.Gregg says. Yet the challenger, who lumps Mr. Bush withcongressional Democrats as he blasts the &quot;one-partygovernment&quot; in Washington, remains positioned to harvestdisenchantment with politics-as-usual.   &quot;We're not really running against him,&quot; a top Bushstrategist said last week. &quot;We're running against ourselves.&quot;   That's precisely where Mr. Bush is struggling, as a visitto Cuzzin Richie's makes clear. Waitress Joyce Mason, whoseprevious employer, a once-thriving Italian restaurant, hasshut down, frets that &quot;if I was to lose my job today, Iwouldn't get one.&quot; Every day, Manager Peter Pierce says,skilled-trades workers accustomed to earning $35,000 a yearapply for $5-an-hour dishwashing work. The truck stop itselfremains profitable, but proprietor Michael Neves isstruggling to avoid foreclosure late this month because ofdifficulty borrowing money for another venture for which thetruck stop was put up as collateral. &quot;In New England, it'snext to impossible to borrow money right now,&quot; he says.   Mr. Pierce supported the president in 1988, but remainsuncommitted five weeks before the primary. While Mr. Bush&quot;got geared up for the Persian Gulf situation,&quot; he &quot;hasn'treally put forward anything&quot; to handle domestic issues, Mr.Pierce complains. &quot;What people are really looking for is alittle bit of leadership.&quot;   Such expectations heighten the stakes for Mr. Bush's Jan.28 State of the Union address, in which the president willlay out a new economic program. The elements of that programhave become all the more important because of the almostuniversally negative reviews of Mr. Bush's just-completedAsia trip. &quot;Thirsty men want beer, not explanations,&quot; saysThomas Rath, a former state attorney general and a Bushadviser in Concord. &quot;What {voters} are going to say is, `CanI go down and apply for a job tomorrow?'&quot;   Indeed, Vice President Dan Quayle, campaigning in NewHampshire last week, hinted that the president may bring moregood news when he arrives tomorrow on top of theelection-year assistance the administration has already beendoling out in recent weeks: increased small-business lendingand a passport-processing center that will employ 400 peopleat a redeveloped Pease air base.   Gov. Gregg and his father, former Gov. Hugh Gregg, arealso cranking up a Bush organization that was first assembledduring the 1980 campaign. The elder Gregg says he's &quot;veryconcerned&quot; that presidential security requirements won'tpermit the sort of down-home campaigning that helped Mr. Bushin 1988, but he has formidable resources at his disposal. Thepresident will campaign here at least twice more after thisweek, and Vice President Quayle and cabinet members willblanket the state. Gov. Gregg, Sen. Bob Smith and former Sen.Gordon Humphrey co-signed an appeal for solidarity that wasmailed to 15,000 &quot;fellow conservatives&quot; last week, and theBush-Quayle campaign plans to contact each of the state's210,000 Republicans by phone and mail before the primary. ATV blitz is expected to begin soon after the State of theUnion speech.   &quot;I don't think you can make up for three years of neglectwith a couple of weeks of gifts and attention,&quot; Mr. Buchananinsists. But he concedes that the &quot;royalist and loyalist&quot; GOPelectorate here may ultimately unite behind the president.University of New Hampshire political scientist David Moore,whose recent polls show Mr. Bush still popular amongRepublicans here, says Mr. Bush &quot;could very well smotherBuchanan without much difficulty.&quot;   Yet Mr. Rath frets that &quot;this is a very volatile, queasyelectorate&quot; and that Mr. Buchanan's angry supporters may bemore motivated than Mr. Bush's larger following to turn outon Election Day. And if that embarrasses the president bygiving Mr. Buchanan a third or more of the primary vote,that's just what some Republicans here have in mind. &quot;Ireally think he {Mr. Bush} pays too much attention to{events} abroad,&quot; says Meredith Gadbois, a 41-year-oldhousewife who heard Mr. Quayle address the Littleton Chamberof Commerce last week. &quot;I think he ought to be scared alittle bit.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
