Virtually all of thecommission's significant findings had been publicly discussed. The finalreport, released later Friday at a press conference, was positive but alsoanti-climactically familiar.;    Our guess is, the mayor's staff thought thatby keeping reporters out of the morning commission meeting, they couldmanipulate more media attention for Hammer's afternoon news conference on thesame subject.;    The city attorney's legal rationalizations notwithstanding,it was dumb politics. Hammer ought to be embarrassed that she went along. Andshe should order all such meetings to be open from now on.;    The irony isthat not only did the commission have nothing to hide, it actually had much tocrow about. While individual aspects of the report already had been reportedpiecemeal, the compilation is impressive.;    By identifying a site andlisting possible financing strategies, the commission has presented the citycouncil -- and the Giants' ownership -- with a rough draft of what could wellbecome an inviting proposal for both sides.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910701  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  236  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday July 1, 199100183045,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
