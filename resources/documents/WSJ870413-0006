The immediate result is that it gives Texaco's beleaguered management a buffer against the financial chaos that could have resulted if the company had been forced to put up billions of dollars of assets as security while it pursued relief from the huge damage award.    And it is a setback for Pennzoil Co. In the bankruptcy-law case, Pennzoil loses the ability to place liens on Texaco's assets and is forced to assume the role of an unsecured creditor -- by far the largest unsecured creditor, but still one rung lower than bankers and others with secured claims to Texaco's assets.    But for the longer term, the U.S.'s largest bankruptcy-law filing ever puts a cloud of uncertainty over the largest award in a court case ever.    &quot;Bankruptcy really reshuffles the deck, and the nature of a reshuffling is that it's unpredictable,&quot; says Joseph Chervin, a New York bankruptcy lawyer. &quot;Bankruptcy offers opportunities as well as pitfalls from an economic standpoint.&quot;    The status of Texaco's industry partners, bankers, bondholders, shareholders, suppliers and even Texaco pensioners all will be determined by arguments heard in bankruptcy court. Texaco says that it will continue &quot;business as usual,&quot; but the competing claims of creditors and investors can produce unexpected results. Bankruptcy experts caution that the case can produce as many losers as winners.    The biggest immediate advantage to Texaco is that it can stave off Pennzoil's attempts to secure a claim on its assets, while continuing to seek relief from the huge judgment in the Texas courts. Indeed, despite the filing, a previously scheduled hearing on Texaco's request for an injunction blocking Pennzoil from securing the judgment will be held this morning in Houston. In any event, bankruptcy specialists say that the federal bankruptcy judge handling the case is likely to let Texaco's appeals continue in Texas state courts and into the federal court system.    Pennzoil said it will press its claims fully in court -- but it will only be the loudest of many competing voices in the bankruptcy-law proceeding, each trying to maintain as strong as possible a grip on Texaco's future cash flow.    Pennzoil officials said they believe the favorable rulings the company has won in several courts -- including last week's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court -- should strengthen Pennzoil's claims in the bankruptcy-law proceedings. The unanimous high court ruling gave Pennzoil the right to immediately move to seize control of billions of dollars of Texaco's assets. Several experts expect Pennzoil to vigorously press the bankruptcy court to dismiss Texaco's filing and deny the company Chapter 11 protection.    But some analysts think Pennzoil could be a big loser in bankruptcy court. The filing could give Texaco time to win a reprieve in other courts that would decrease or eliminate Pennzoil's big award, analysts say, or the judgment could be substantially lowered during negotiations among various classes of creditors and investors. &quot;After the dust settles, and you total up all the assets and liabilities, presumably you're talking about something significantly less than 100 cents on the dollar,&quot; said Martin Klein, a New York bankruptcy lawyer.    &quot;I take my hat off to Texaco,&quot; says William L. Randol, First Boston Corp. oil analyst. &quot;Going this route, Texaco may well be vindicated.&quot;    Meanwhile, Texaco will be busy assuring suppliers and creditors that the bankruptcy-law case actually increases the likelihood they will get paid, since Texaco no longer has to worry about pledging $5 billion of its assets, as Pennzoil requested in court papers filed Friday, to continue its appeal of the judgment award. Now, secured creditors in particular can breathe a little easier because Pennzoil wasn't able to grab liens on Texaco property before the bankruptcy-law filing. &quot;No one creditor likes to see another creditor getting a tactical advantage,&quot; says Mr. Klein.    Texaco also will have to calm unsecured creditors, especially its oil suppliers, since it is a relatively reserves-poor oil company that needs to purchase oceans of crude oil from others to keep its refineries primed and its service stations full of gasoline. Texaco will be aided in its effort by recent examples of companies that operated fairly normally under bankruptcy-law protection or even emerged from the proceedings far healthier -- such as Wickes Cos., a retailer, and Texas Air Corp.'s Continental Airlines unit, which used bankruptcy court to break union contracts.    &quot;I don't want to say it's in vogue, but there's certainly no stigma attached to (bankruptcy) these days,&quot; says Mr. Klein. &quot;It will give them a breathing spell, a chance to step back from the precipice.&quot;    Still, any bankruptcy-law case -- and especially one so large and complex -- contains unforeseen risks.    &quot;We've had a game of Texas poker, and Pennzoil has played it to the limit,&quot; says Frederick P. Leuffer, senior oil analyst for Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc., &quot;but there are no winners (from a bankruptcy-law filing) except perhaps the lawyers. The whole system loses, in a way, and it's clearly going to have a ripple effect on other companies.&quot;    Despite Texaco's assurances to creditors, he noted, &quot;other companies are going to balk at extending Texaco credit or taking Texaco into drilling ventures unless they get cash up front, and certain suppliers are going to be reluctant to extend any credit.&quot;    In fact, for every example of a company that has thrived under bankruptcy-law protection, there is another case of a company whose proceeding deteriorated into a contentious, costly fight. For example, the Hunt brothers of Dallas are trying now to persuade creditors to let them use cash to fund an aggressive offshore oil production venture to help rescue their Placid Oil Co., which filed for bankruptcy-law protection last year.    Even more ominous are the examples set by Manville Corp. and A.H. Robins Co., which filed for court protection because of huge product liability claims against them.    &quot;Manville and Robins indicate that the trauma may be far worse than anticipated,&quot; said Frank Kennedy, a bankruptcy specialist at the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor. He noted, for example, that even though Manville was solvent aside from its legal liabilities, &quot;the experience was devastating to common shareholders.&quot; And at Robins, proceedings have been marked by controversy over post-bankruptcy-filing payments and a court-appointed examiner.    Mr. Kennedy also noted that large bankruptcy-law proceedings usually take longer to resolve than can be anticipated, while draining away management time and energy. Some managers grow frustrated with the limits placed on them by bankruptcy court and abandon ship. Legal and accounting expenses are huge. Plus, he noted, all types of unforeseen claims materialize. &quot;There are new claims that are filed that were out there in the boondocks that nobody was aware of,&quot; he said.    Meanwhile, major oil companies that have foreign joint ventures with Texaco were quick to note that foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of Texaco wouldn't be involved in the bankruptcy-law filing. Although Caltex Petroleum Co., a large refining and marketing group with operations primarily in Asia, is jointly owned by Texaco and Chevron Corp., &quot;it operates independently and doesn't depend on either Texaco or Chevron for funding,&quot; a Chevron spokeswoman said. She said that Caltex is &quot;the major thing we've got going with Texaco&quot; and that Chevron &quot;wouldn't feel it appropriate to comment further at this time.&quot;    Among other foreign operations, Texaco is also one of the four original shareholders of Arabian American Oil Co., which accounts for all of Saudi Arabia's oil production. But an Aramco spokesman said in Washington that the Saudi-American consortium doesn't expects its operations to be affected.    In the U.S., Texaco is a partner with several major oil companies in various ventures, such as the development of Gulf of Mexico oil and gas fields with Du Pont Co.'s Conoco Inc. unit. Conoco declined to discuss the impact, if any, on the Gulf of Mexico project. But an official of the Independent Petroleum Association of America noted that &quot;several hundred&quot; independent oil operators are involved with Texaco in domestic oil and gas fields and that the bankruptcy-law filing could result in &quot;a tangled mess.&quot;    While not surprised by the filing, Texaco workers were still concerned. Many employee unions had established bankruptcy committees after the initial court case two years ago, and have kept busy combing through company bulletins explaining the possible consequences of the latest court rulings.    &quot;It's a worry,&quot; said Nelson Edgerly, who represents 3,200 refinery workers in Port Arthur, Texas, where Texaco's first refinery was built. &quot;We don't know anything yet. The people working don't know if they'll have jobs, and the retired people don't know if their pensions are going to be there.&quot;    Robert Wages, international vice president for the oil sector of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers, said the employees will work for representation on the creditors' committee, &quot;and keep a dialogue going with the company.&quot;    Sitting on the sidelines for two years has been frustrating for the workers, he said. &quot;What really bothers us is we think Texaco tried to resolve it,&quot; said Mr. Wages. &quot;Our people don't deserve to go through this . . . The way the companies acted -- I don't think they care . . . about the employees.&quot;    ---   Paulette Thomas and Matt Moffett contributed to this article.    ---               Texaco's Largest Creditors                  (Excluding Pennzoil)                  (As of Dec. 31, 1986)  Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. ........... $250 million  Manufacturers Hanover as trustee  on 8 7/8% debentures due in 2005 .......... $223.7 million  Manufacturers Hanover as trustee  on 7 3/4% debentures due in 2001 .......... $121 million  Chase Manhattan Bank ...................... $160 million  Manufacturers Hanover as trustee  on 5 3/4% debentures due in 1997 .......... $70.8 million  Rabobank .................................. $50 million  Southern California Gas ................... $2.9 million  Lummus Crest Inc. ......................... $2.1 million  William Este Inc. ......................... $1.9 million  Tenneco Oil Co. ........................... $1.8 million   (See: &quot;Corrections andamp; Amplifications: Chase Manhattan Bank&quot;-- WSJ April 14, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
