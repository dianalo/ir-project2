Rudy Boschwitz, who leaves office inJanuary, has appealed to colleagues to hire a woman who washomeless when she went to work for him two years ago.   ``I have an employee who can't wait,'' the Minnesota Republicanwrote his fellow senators.   Some of Boschwitz's workers have found jobs since he lost hisre-election bid in November, but Valerie Gaines, a 36-year-oldtypist, has had just two interviews without success so far. Herhusband has been disabled by two strokes and cannot work, she says.She has two daughters, aged 6 and 8.   ``Valerie hasn't found a new job ... and we need to place herquickly to avoid another debilitating bout with homelessness,''Boschwitz wrote. ``Valerie Gaines will be an asset to youroffice.''   Boschwitz called Gaines an ``excellent employee.''   Gaines had worked for then-Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., for twoyears but lost her job when he retired in 1988. During three weeksof being out of work, her family was evicted and their belongingswere stolen.   Boschwitz's staff hired her without knowing that the address shehad given was that of a homeless shelter. She now lives in anapartment in suburban Maryland.   Gaines said Friday she has had two interviews about jobs in theDepartment of Agriculture but no overtures from other members ofCongress.   ``I'm trying to keep optimistic that the someone will call soonand say they want me to work on their staff in some capacity,'' shesaid. ``It's Christmas time; we're being merry.''</TEXT></DOC>
