For one lump-sum premium, a policyholder is entitled to a death benefit, tax-deferred earnings and virtually unrestricted, tax-free access to earnings and principal. As a result, single-premium life insurance is being aggressively promoted as an alternative to tax-free municipal bonds, money-market funds, certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts.    But some financial advisers believe investors are being seduced. Promoters, they say, are using terms like &quot;guaranteed,&quot; &quot;tax-deferred&quot; and &quot;tax-free&quot; without warning about risks, hidden costs and a possible tax backfire. &quot;Everyone's jumping on single-premium,&quot; says Paul Silberberg, president of CMS Co., a Philadelphia investment firm. &quot;I know a lot of people are going to be hurt.&quot;    Single-premium insurance begins with a payment, typically of at least $5,000 and usually no more than $1 million. Under the terms of most policies, there are no further payments, but investors can, of course, buy more than one policy.    The money may be applied to a whole-life or a variable policy.    With a whole-life policy, the insurer sets an interest rate, which is usually guaranteed for one to five years and then adjusted, typically once a year. Most policies guarantee a minimum rate of 4% to 6%. The company's fees -- and the cost of providing insurance -- are covered by the difference between what it makes investing the premium and the interest it pays.    With a variable policy, an investor can direct how the premium is invested -- in a bond fund, stock fund or money-market fund, for example. Financial planners consider the variable policy riskier than the whole-life policy because the earnings depend solely on the success of the fund. Furthermore, the fees tend to be higher on a variable policy.    Whatever the earnings on the policy, no taxes are owed on them unless the policy is surrendered. A policyholder may also borrow all of the earnings -- still without paying income taxes -- and paying little or no out-of-pocket interest. Depending on the policy, the holder may also borrow from 75% to 100% of the principal at a low net interest rate.    Single-premium insurance seems to make perfect sense for some kinds of investors. Take, for example, a couple approaching retirement with a lump sum of cash that has been in, say, a money-market account. The couple can put the cash into a single-premium policy, let it build tax-deferred for a few years and then start borrowing from the policy tax-free. When the insured dies, the death benefit and the remainder of the policy, minus the loans and interest owed, passes to the beneficiary free of income taxes.    Couples who want to save for a child's education are another natural constituency for single-premium insurance. They can buy a policy and let the interest accrue tax-deferred until their child reaches college age. Then they can borrow the tuition from the policy. They have the added benefit of life insurance should the breadwinner die in the meantime.    Good as this may sound, there's a big catch: Once a person has invested in a single-premium policy, it can be forbiddingly expensive to get out of it.    In the early years there are surrender fees. Although these are slowly phased out, there can still be problems. Suppose the couple who put their child through college needed all the principal in their policy and wanted to cash it in. They would be taxed on all the income they had borrowed over the years plus any other earnings that had built up in the account.    Single-premium policies are &quot;like a yacht that's traveling along and it looks wonderful,&quot; says Karen Spero, an investment adviser for Spero Financial Services in Beachwood, Ohio. &quot;But then I decide to sell the boat, and I find I can't get rid of it entirely. I've always got this little dinghy trailing behind me.&quot;    There are some other possible shortcomings. One is that the interest rates insurers guarantee initially may last no longer than the guarantee period. Then, depending on the skill of the company's money managers, the rate may fall far below what the investor expected. &quot;At a lot of insurance companies, money managers have produced very mediocre results,&quot; Mr. Silberberg says. &quot;Tax reform didn't turn these people into good money managers overnight.&quot;    Furthermore, says Linda J. Jepson, a registered principal with Financial Planners Equity Corp. in Erie, Pa., the illustrations being used to market policies are frequently based on insurers' current expenses and death-benefit costs. If the insurer's costs increase significantly, a policyholder who has taken liberal advantage of the &quot;tax-free&quot; withdrawals may be faced with an unpleasant choice: Either deposit more money into the policy or let it lapse, thereby causing adverse tax consequences.    Investors should also note that some companies quote gross interest rates (before fees and mortality charges have been deducted), while others quote net rates. Other policy variations include the duration of the interest-rate guarantee; the minimum interest rate; the interest rate an investor must pay when borrowing from the principal; and the size of the death benefits.    The charge for surrendering the policy in the early years is also something to watch, financial advisers say. The rule of thumb, says James Hunt, a director of the National Insurance Consumer Organization, is &quot;don't buy it if you can't surrender it after one year for as much as you put into it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
