At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Ueberroth said he would stay on for as long as a year after his contract expires at the end of 1989 to help his successor negotiate critical labor and national television contracts. Both end with the 1989 season.    Mr. Ueberroth's hastily gathered news conference came amid rumors he would extend his stay as commissioner. The 50-year-old former travel-company executive, who gained fame as chairman of the organizing committee for the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, had long predicted he would be a one-term commissioner.    Strong-willed and bottom-line oriented, Mr. Ueberroth succeeded Bowie Kuhn as commissioner in 1984, when baseball was reeling financially from soaring player salaries.    He has guided the sport to a much stronger financial position, but has frequently clashed with some team owners, who felt he wielded too much power. He wasn't popular with players, either. They have charged in a series of labor grievances that he orchestrated the closing of the market for free-agent players, a charge he has denied.    Mr. Ueberroth, often mentioned as a potential political candidate, wouldn't comment on his future plans. </TEXT></DOC>
