The analysis says that the projected federal deficit for fiscal 1988 has expanded in recent months by about $27 billion because of changes in economic conditions and new estimates of federal outlays. That means that Mr. Reagan's proposed budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 would produce a $135 billion deficit instead of the $108 billion deficit target set by Gramm-Rudman.    The analysis means that the White House may have to propose budget savings that go beyond the domestic spending cuts and revenue-raising measures it submitted to Congress in January.    Disclosure of the analysis also will embarrass the administration. President Reagan has been criticizing Democratic lawmakers for drafting budgets that fail to adhere to Gramm-Rudman, and Democrats have fired back by contending that the president's own budget -- which purports to hit the law's deficit target on the nose -- actually misses it by billions of dollars.    The new White House budget office projections, though preliminary, bolster the Democrats' claims. In fact, the White House deficit projection nearly matches a Congressional Budget Office estimate that the president's budget would produce a fiscal 1988 deficit of $134.4 billion.    The Democrats, meanwhile, were having some embarrassment of their own. Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means Committee wrote to the House Budget Committee to complain about the difficulties in raising taxes. In a letter to Budget Committee Chairman William Gray (D., Pa.), Rep. Rostenkowski said he would have trouble finding the $30 billion of new taxes that the Senate-passed resolution called for in each of the fiscal years 1988 and 1989.    He also stated his panel would be loath to make larger cuts in Medicare than contemplated by the House-passed resolution and would have difficulty producing a bill that would raise the taxes and make the spending cuts as quickly as the Senate resolution specified. Rep. Rostenkowski's letter was intended to influence the House-Senate conference that is trying to reconcile differences between the two chambers' budget plans.    Under Gramm-Rudman, the administration must propose additional savings to meet the law's deficit target if its official budget update, which is scheduled for release in late July or early August, shows the need for such measures. The White House would find it painful politically to come up with more budget cuts on top of the unpopular measures it submitted in January. &quot;It'll be a problem,&quot; one White House official admitted.    But the administration's budget update is likely to paint a less gloomy picture than the internal budget office analysis did, White House sources said. Among other things, the analysis doesn't take account of an unexpected surge in federal revenues last month -- a development that has led some forecasters to shrink their deficit projections for the current fiscal year and suggests that the new tax law might generate more revenue than previously expected.    Still, the deficit picture clearly has worsened since January. According to the budget office analysis, the fiscal 1988 deficit is about $16 billion wider than projected because gross national product -- the nation's total output of goods and services, unadjusted for inflation -- turned out to be lower than the administration had expected for the fourth quarter of 1986 and the first quarter of 1987. The projected deficit grew about $11 billion more because of new estimates of federal outlays, some involving &quot;technical re-estimates,&quot; some reflecting congressional action such as passage of a major highway bill.    The analysis was prepared by the bureau headed by M. Kathryn Eickhoff, who is leaving her post Monday as the budget office's associate director for economics and planning. Asked about the analysis, Ms. Eickhoff confirmed it. </TEXT></DOC>
