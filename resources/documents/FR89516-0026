That section states that all Orders are tobe promulgated through notice and comment procedures similar to the rulemakingprocess utilized for Bureau of Land Managment (Bureau) regulations, and,when issued in final form, are to be applicable on a nationwide basis.A table is included in andSection; 3164.1 of the existing regulations whichshows the existing, and if applicable, former Orders and former Noticesto Lessees and Operators. This proposed rulemaking would result in anothersuch Order. This proposed Order is specifically intended to supplementand implement the provisions of andSection; 3162.1 General Requirements;andSection; 3162.5-1 Environmental Obligations; andSection; 3162.5-2 Controlof Wells; and andSection; 3162.5-3 Safety Precautions. Industry practices for operations in a hydrogen sulfide (H<T2>2</T2>S) or sulfur dioxide (SO<T2>2</T2>) environment have been established and the standards of theDepartment of the Interior have been previously identified by the formerConservation Division of the U.S. Geological Survey in Manual section R79-CDM643.9 and draft Notice to Lessees (NTL) 10. Subsequently, the Bureau ofLand Management published a proposed rulemaking, Onshore Oil and Gas OrderNo. 2, in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on October 15, 1984 (49 FR 40354). Onshore Oiland Gas Order No. 2, the previously proposed rulemaking, dealt with theconduct of operations in an H<T2>2</T2>S environment. The proposed Order was subsequently correctedby a publication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> dated November 8, 1984 (49 FR 44655). A significant number of comments were received from oil and gas industryrepresentatives and groups on proposed Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 2.The comments on that proposed Order called for extensive revision of theproposed Order. In recognition of the validity of many of the comments,a determination was made to publish a new proposed rulemaking which addressesmany of the concerns set forth in the comments. This proposed rulemakingis that republication, but has been renumbered as proposed Onshore Oiland Gas Order No. 6. The specific changes made by this new proposed rulemakingand the reasons for the adoption or rejection of specific suggestions regardingthe original proposed Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 2 are described laterin this preamble. It is the intent of the Bureau of Land Management to identify its uniformnational requirements for operators who conduct operations that are knownto or could reasonably be expected to involve oil or gas that containsH<T2>2</T2>S or which could result in the release of SO<T2>2</T2> as a result of flaring of H<T2>2</T2>S. This rule also addresses the procedures to be followed inareas where H<T2>2</T2>S is known not to exist or cannot reasonably be expected to exist.It also is the Bureau's intent to identify in advance the probable correctiveactions, normal abatement periods, and enforcement actions that will resultwhen a violation(s) of the requirements is found and the violation(s) isnot timely abated. This proposed Order is applicable to all onshore Federaland Indian (except Osage Tribe) oil and gas leases when drilling, completing,testing, reworking, producing, injecting, gathering, storing or treatingoperations are being conducted in zones which are known or could reasonablybe expected to contain concentrations of H<T2>2</T2>S (100 ppm or more H<T2>2</T2>S in gas stream) or which, as a result of flaring of the H<T2>2</T2>S, might result in SO<T2>2</T2> gas in such quantities that, if permitted to escape or to beaccidentally released, could constitute a hazard to human life or property.This Order sets standards which have been developed to be minimums forH<T2>2</T2>S operations under differing conditions and in different partsof the country. It is recognized that under some conditions, additionalrequirements will be imposed routinely or general variances to specificrequirements will be granted in approval documents or on a field-wide basis.In developing these standards, the committee responsible for the preparationof this proposed Order has referred to existing regulatory and industrystandards, such as those prepared by the Federal Occupational Safety andHealth Administration (OSHA), Minerals Management Service, American PetroleumInstitute, the Texas Railroad Commission, the American National StandardsInstitute, and the National Association of Corrosion Engineers. The purpose of this proposed rulemaking is to achieve a better understandingby the oil and gas industry of the requirements of the Bureau of Land Managementfor hydrogen sulfide operations so that operations to develop Federal mineralresources may be conducted in a consistently safe manner. This proposedOrder will also serve to promote more uniform and consistent inspectionsby the Bureau. The primary emphasis of this proposed Order is on requirements that arenecessary to maintain control of wells and protect public health and safetyand that are distinct from Federal OSHA requirements to protect workers.It is the intent of this proposed Order to establish requirements and minimumstandards that are applicable in the majority of H<T2>2</T2>S operations on a national scale and, as such, grant the authorizedofficer discretionary authority to approve measures, which may vary fromthose contained in this proposed Order, when such other measures are determinedto be reasonable, necessary, and justified. Further, this proposed Orderplaces on the operator(s) the primary burden of responsibility for manyof the application, reporting, and review requirements (i.e., determiningradii of exposure, reviewing H<T2>2</T2>S drilling operations and public protection plans, reportingH<T2>2</T2>S releases, advising the authorized officer if H<T2>2</T2>S is encountered unexpectedly, change of field conditions, etc.).The proposed Order also includes provisions, as applicable, for well completionand workover operations. The public is invited to specifically review andcomment on these provisions.In general, the proposed Order is comprised of four sections which include:(1) Applications, approvals, and reports; (2) public protection; (3) drilling/completion/workoverrequirements; and (4) production requirements. The major differences between this proposed Order and the provisions ofNTL-10 and the previously proposed Order No. 2 are: (1) The threshold applicabilitycriteria in this proposed Order of 100 ppm H<T2>2</T2>S in the gas stream (previously 20 ppm); (2) the eliminationof the need to calculate a 20 ppm radius of exposure around wells and facilities;(3) the applicability of the Pasquill-Gifford equation will be applicableonly for calculation of radii of exposure where the actual or anticipatedH<T2>2</T2>S concentrations are less than 10 percent by volume in the gasstream; and (4) the requirement of a H<T2>2</T2>S Drilling Operations Plan and, if the general public is potentiallyaffected, a Public Protection Plan (previously jointly referred to as ``contingencyplan''). The major changes concerning drilling made by the proposed Order are: (1)The emphasis to protect ``essential personnel'' which is defined as thoseon-site personnel necessary to maintain control of the well as opposedto other personnel on-site to perform other functions; (2) the applicabilityof this proposed order to areas where H<T2>2</T2>S is known not to exist or cannot be reasonably expected; (3)the certification by the applicant in the Application for Permit to Drill(APD) that all personnel will receive proper H<T2>2</T2>S safety training prior to the terms of the proposed Order beingeffective; (4) the requirement that the terms of the proposed Order bein effect when drilling reaches a depth of 500 feet above, or 3 days priorto penetrating (whichever comes first) the first zone containing or expectedto contain H<T2>2</T2>S (previously 1,000 feet or 7 days); (5) the requirement thata suitable and safe means of flare ignition must be used (automatic ignitorpreviously required); (6) the requirement for equipment to monitor SO<T2>2 </T2>levels in the flare area; (7) the limitation of the use of mud-gasseparator and rotating head to areas where pressures are unknown; and (8)the allowance for either red, white and black, or yellow and black colorsas ``danger'' or ``caution'' signs, respectively. The major revisions concerning production from the 1984 proposed ordermade by this proposed Order are: (1) The limitation to stock tanks with500 ppm H<T2>2</T2>S vapor or more in the tank in the Order (previously 100 ppmH<T2>2</T2>S vapor in stock tank); (2) the elimination of the blanket requirementfor installation of vapor recovery equipment at all stock tanks; (3) therequirement that production facilities subject to the Order include allequipment to the point of sales for royalty purposes; (4) the requirementthat existing facilities have 180 days from the effective date of the Orderto determine the H<T2>2</T2>S concentration, calculate the 100 and 500 ppm radii of exposureand submit the information and one year to modify all production facilitiesin accordance with the terms of the Order (previously 30 and 150 days,respectively); (5) the determination that automatic safety valves willbe required only when specified criteria are met; and (6) the modificationof provisions for warning signs along flow lines. The proposed rulemaking for Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 2 resulted inthe receipt of comments from 51 oil and gas companies and industry organizations.A summary of the significant comments and the action taken in the developmentof this proposed rulemaking is discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Comments </ITAG>Several of the comments suggested that proposed Onshore Oil and Gas OrderNo. 2 exceeded the Bureau of Land Management's authority regarding workersafety and unnecessarily overlapped with the requirements of the Statesand the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the Departmentof Labor. During the time since the order was first proposed, the Bureauhas worked with OSHA to eliminate overlap areas and narrow the scope ofthis proposed Order to include only those requirements for which BLM hasresponsibility, i.e., those minimum standards necessary to maintain controlof the well(s) and protect public health and safety. Other general comments expressed the view that the economic impact of proposedOrder No.2 on the industry, particularly the small and independent operators,was underestimated. The comments identified principal areas of increasedcosts such as rental equipment for drilling and monitoring (i.e., BOPs.chokes, rotating head, mud-gas separators, and portable detectors) andconverting all existing storage tanks to ``closed systems'' and retrofittingmany wells with two maater valves and automatic safety valves for production.In an effort to meet the issues raised in these comments, this proposedOrder has shortened the time (3 days or 500 feet above a known or expectedH<T2>2</T2>S formation) within which H<T2>2</T2>S drilling equipment will be required and now requires extraequipment only when necessary or pressures dictate, thereby reducing thecosts. The minimum number of pieces of respiratory and portable detectionequipment required by the proposed Order would be limited to that necessaryfor ``essential personnel'' in recognition of the difference in the Bureau'sarea of responsibility (requiring that the well be controlled and protectingpublic health and safety) vis-a-vis the jurisdiction generally delegatedto OSHA for overall worker safety. The blanket requirement of proposedOrder No. 2 that all storage facilities be converted to ``closed systems''also has been eliminated by this proposed Order, thus eliminating a majorportion of the previously anticipated costs. In addition, the requirementfor two master valves and automatic safety valves for existing wells hasbeen modified by this proposed Order to be required only when specificpublic protection applicability criteria are met. This proposed Order tailorsH<T2>2</T2>S requirements to those necessary to protect the Federal interestswithin the regulatory authority of the Bureau of Land Management. The requirementsof this proposed Order are reflective of common industry practices currentlyin use, e.g., the American Petroleum Institute's <T3>Recommended Practices_49. </T3>Therefore, this proposed Order willnot have a major economic impact on the oil and gas industry as a wholeor to a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments on Specific Issues </ITAG>Many of the comments on proposed Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 2 expressedconcern that the threshold criteria of 20 ppm H<T2>2</T2>S in the gas stream for implementing the requirements of an Ordercovering H<T2>2</T2>S was unnecessarily low. The Bureau of Land Management agreesthat its authority regarding H<T2>2</T2>S is related to public health and safety and to maintaining wellcontrol, therefore, this proposed Order uses a threshold criteria of 100ppm (in the gas stream), a level that the Bureau believes, based, in part,on the Environmental Protection Agency's research on ambient air concentrationsof H<T2>2</T2>S on human beings would protect public health and safety. However,a 10 ppm ambient air concentration either on a drilling/completion/workoversite, or 50 feet from a production facility, would trigger the provisionsof the drilling operations plan or require vapor recovery, respectively.Great concern was expressed in the comments about whether the Order wouldbe made applicable to areas where H<T2>2</T2>S is unknown. The applicability criteria to determine when theterms of this proposed Order are in effect have been rewritten to providethat formations must be known to or could reasonably be expected (basedon geology in the basin, experience, etc.) to contain H<T2>2</T2>S. The Bureau has determined that there is not sufficient justificationto require these measures be implemented on sites where hydrogen sulfideis not known or could not reasonably be expected to be present. Several of the comments expressed the view that Bureau of Land Managementauthorized officers and inspection personnel are not generally knowledgeableabout H<T2>2</T2>S, do not exercise discretionary authority in a reasonable manner,and are relatively inflexible in enforcing H<T2>2</T2>S requirements. In response to these comments, the Bureau hasestablished a training program to educate its personnel concerning H<T2>2</T2>S and this reproposed Order generally establishes standards whichprovide limited discretionary authority to the authorized officer to requiremore or, in some cases, less stringent standards; for example, an old fieldwhere a history of safe operations exists would allow the authorized officerto require less stringent standards. The Bureau's policy with regard toinspector flexibility is that all inspections are to be uniform and ifthe inspector determines that the minimum standards in this proposed Orderare found to apply, they will be enforced. Some comments addressed the requirement that a determination of H<T2>2</T2>S concentrations be made before the submission of an Applicationfor a Permit to Drill, about the requirement to annually test the H<T2>2</T2>S concentration of each well and facility, and the 30-day timeframe to submit such data to the Bureau of Land Management. The Bureauagrees that this may be unnecessarily burdensome, therefore, the proposedOrder will require the operator to 1) submit only the 100 and 500 ppm radii-of-exposureto the Bureau with an Application for Permit to Drill and 2) test the wellsand facilities initially for H<T2>2</T2>S concentration, with the information made available to the Bureauonly upon request. The proposed Order also extends the requirement to submitsuch information to 180 days for existing wells and 60 days for new wells.A significant number of the comments raised questions about the meaningof the phrase ``potential for public access'' as it was used in the publicparticipation applicability criteria in proposed Order No. 2. The Bureauagrees that such wording may be too inclusive, and, thus the wording hasbeen changed in this proposed Order to read ``where the public could bereasonably expected to frequent.'' The public is specifically requestedto review this wording and offer comments on this language. Many of the comments expressed the opinion that the 1,000 feet or 7 daysbefore the first H<T2>2</T2>S formation proposed requirement is too restrictive and wouldadd unnecessarily to drilling costs. Various drilling scenarios, e.g.,high versus low penetration rates, were developed in connection with thepreparation of this proposed Order, and it is agreed that the provisionsset forth in proposed Order No. 2 are unnecesarily stringent; therefore,this proposed Order provides for 500 feet or 3 days prior to penetrating(whichever comes first) the known or anticipated H<T2>2</T2>S zone. A number of the comments indicated that the requirement in proposed OrderNo. 2 to contact the authorized officer and obtain approval to resume drillingwhen H<T2>2</T2>S was unexpectedly encountered would be too burdensome and unreasonableduring the normal course of business. This proposed requirement has beenrewritten in this Order to place on the operator the responsibility toimplement the minimum operational requirements of the proposed Order priorto resuming drilling ahead operations. The paperwork and notification requirementsmay be met later (within specified time periods), provided that the requirementshave been accomplished.Several of the comments suggested that a standard 2-mile radius map thatwas proposed to be submitted with the Public Protection Plan by proposedOrder No. 2 was not necessary in instances where the H<T2>2</T2>S concentration is known. It is agreed that the 2-mile radiusmap should be replaced with a map that focuses on the H<T2>2</T2>S concentration; therefore, this proposed Order makes referenceto the 100 ppm radius (or 3,000 feet, if conditions are not known).A number of the comments objected to the proposed requirement for two accessroads at drilling locations. This proposed Order has changed that provisionby lessening the proposed requirement for two access roads to those instanceswhere two such roads are practical, with a footpath (in addition to oneaccess road) being sufficient as a means of safe egress where a secondroad is not practical.Many of the comments objected to the provision in proposed Order No. 2that H<T2>2</T2>S training be provided by ``an instructor acceptable to the authorizedofficer.'' Proposed Order No. 6 no longer contains this proposal, but hasreplaced it with language requiring the operator to certify that all personnelwill be trained in accordance with American Petroleum Institute<T3> Recommended Practices_49.</T3>Some comments suggested that the designation of the most normally upwindbriefing area be changed from ``Safe'' to ``Primary'' briefing area inorder that the terminology in this order be consistent with standard industryparlance. This suggestion has been adopted by this proposed Order.A variety of concerns about responsiblity for the availability and useof protective equipment for personnel were expressed. The Bureau is responsiblefor public health and safety; however, responsibility for implementinga proper respiratory protection program lies with the operator. In recognitionof common industry practice, proposed Order No. 6 provides that equipmentmust be ``readily available,'' communication equipment for outside contactmust be provided where ``practical,'' and all personnel must be able toobtain a facial seal with the breathing equipment rather than the morestringent measures previously proposed. In addition, the operator shalladvise service companies of the H<T2>2</T2>S hazard so that they may take necessary measures to protecttheir employees.The proposed requirements of the previously proposed Order concerning thelocation and testing of H<T2>2</T2>S detection and monitoring equipment were the focus of a significantnumber of critical comments. In general, the comments suggested that theBureau was using a broad-brush approach which was excessively expensiveand would not accrue substantial benefits in terms of increased publichealth and safety. The Bureau concurs with these comments and has, therefore,narrowed the parameters of these provisions. For example, this proposedOrder does not contain the daily testing requirement for detection andmonitoring equipment; instead, operators shall test equipment in accordancewith the manufacturer's recommendations as the Bureau believes this tobe sufficient from a safety standpoint. Also, one of the required sensingpoints for drilling rigs was changed from the ``cellar'' to the ``bellnipple.'' Finally, under the provisions of this proposed Order only ``essential''personnel (i.e., those necessary to maintain control of the well and protectpublic health and safety) are required to have a portable H<T2>2</T2>S detector capable of sensing 10 ppm of H<T2>2</T2>S on-site, instead of requiring all personnel to wear portablepersonal detectors.Many of the comments suggested changes regarding visible warning systems,including the type and number of wind direction indicators needed, thecolor, placement, size, wording, and illumination of warning signs, andthe use of a colored-flag warning system. Again, commentors indicated thatthe Bureau was requiring a level of protection that was economically excessiveand would not significantly increase protection of public health and safety.The Bureau concurs with this assessment, and has, therefore, narrowed thescope of these provisions to encompass those minimum standards necessaryto maintain control of the well and protect public health and safety; furthermeasures can be taken at the operator's discretion. This proposed Orderincludes a requirement that only two wind direction indicators be used,as long as they can be seen from all necessary points on the location;a requirement that signs be legible and visible under all lighting andweather conditions, with allowable colors being red, white, and black oryellow and black for drilling wells in accordance with revised OSHA standards,with the wording on warning signs to be equivalent to the requirement;and that a red warning flag with an accompanying information sign may berequired as a minimum warning system. Additionally, warning signs on allsides of the drilling rig are not included in this proposed Order, butthe requirement for bilingual or multilingual signs, where necessary, hasbeen retained.Several of the comments expressed the view that the requirements for ``contingencyplans'' set out in proposed Order No. 2 were unclear for completion/workoveroperations as opposed to new operations. This proposed Order has been tailored,where necessary, to address these ongoing operations. The proposed Orderdoes not include minimum requirements for preparation of a specific H<T2>2</T2>S operations plan for completions/workovers as is required fornew operations not yet approved by the Bureau for operation. In order toassure that maintenance of the well and protection of public health andsafety are assured at completion/workover operations, this proposed Orderallows Public Protection Plans (where the public protection applicabilitycriteria apply) for individual operations to be included in a field-wideH<T2>2</T2>S plan for routine operations instead of requiring the preparationof a separate plan as is the case for new operations.The provisions in proposed Order No. 2 relating to ``Critical Operationsand Curtailment Plans'' and ``Operating Procedures and Equipment'' werediscussed in a significant number of comments. This proposed Order hasdeleted these provisions because these areas fall outside the Bureau'sjurisdiction and are, therefore, best left to the discretion of the operator.The comments on the requirement in proposed Order No. 2 for an automaticignitor stated that other and more reliable equipment and methodologiescould be used to accomplish the same purpose. The Bureau recognizes thevalidity of this point and therefore, this proposed Order requires a ``suitableand safe'' means of ignition.A significant number of comments objected to the requirement in proposedOrder No. 2 for a remote kill line, remote-controlled choke, mud-gas separator,and rotating head. After reviewing the objections raised in the comments,this proposed Order has eliminated the requirement for a remote kill linebecause it was agreed that the requirement was excessive in a majorityof cases, but the remote kill line will continue to be required for wellsin excess of 5,000 psi by ``Onshore Order No. 2-Drilling.'' However, therequirement for a remote-controlled choke is considered essential and thisrequirement has been retained by this Order. Mud-gas separators and rotatingheads would be required by this Order for exploratory wells only.A number of the comments on proposed Order No. 2 dealt with the proposedmud program provisions, with the primary concern on the proposed requirementto maintain a pH of 10 in a salt-water based mud system as an indicatorof H<T2>2</T2>S. The commentors suggested that in order to maintain a ph levelof 10 in a salt-water based mud system, the level of chemicals which wouldhave to be added to the mud could, in some cases, affect the viscosityand other characteristics of the mud system which are essential to maintainingcontrol of the well. The concerns expressed in these comments are welltaken; therefore, this provision has been modified in this proposed Orderto require that a pH of 10 shall be maintained for fresh-water mud systemsbut a lesser pH level may be allowed by the authorized officer for certainsalt-water based systems.Numerous comments concerned the provisions for kick detection and wellcontrol in proposed Order No. 2, with the suggestion that adherence tothese practices might not be prudent. The Bureau recognizes the validityof these concerns and therefore has determined that specific techniquesfor fulfilling these provisions need not be included in this order.Several of the comments on previously proposed Order No. 2 suggested thatthe Order was too vague or imposed unnecessary requirements on completion/workoveroperations. This proposed Order has been tailored, where necessary, tospecifically address completion/workover operations to meet the objectionsin the comments.A significant number of the comments were received on the requirementsin previously proposed Order No. 2 on the measurement of H<T2>2</T2>S from stock tanks and the resulting use of the applicabilitycriteria. There was strong objection to the 100 ppm criteria because itwas believed to be excessively stringent. BLM recognizes that the 100 ppmcriteria proposed for stock tanks was too low and that measurement outsidethe tank can be difficult.Therefore, 500 ppm H<T2>2</T2>S in the stock tank head space is the proposed criteria in thisproposed order. The 150 day compliance deadline for the production requirements of proposedOrder No. 2 for existing facilities was objectionable to most of the commentorswho believe that 150 days did not provide enough time to bring existingoperations into compliance. After reviewing this issue, the Bureau agreesthat the compliance period should be longer; therefore, this proposed Orderrequires that existing production facilities must be in compliance withinone year after the effective date of the Order. A large number of comments were received concerning the logic, economics,and desirability of requiring ``closed systems'' on all stock tanks. Thegeneral concern of those commenting on this issue suggests that this blanketrequirement was unnecessary and created an economic burden. In agreementwith the comments, the Bureau has amended the proposed order to requirea ``closed'' or ``vapor recovery'' system in those situations when ambientH<T2>2</T2>S concentrations exceed the standard baseline of 10 ppm at 50feet from a facility or where a public area is continuously subjected tosimilar concentrations. Numerous comments were received objecting to the signing and fencing requirementsat surface facilities, including gathering and flowlines. The Bureau believessigning and fencing requirements must assure control of the well and protectpublic health and safety. The Bureau also recognizes that the previousproposed order may have gone further than necessary to establish the minimumstandards necessary to maintain control of the well and protect publichealth and safety. Thus, review of the comments has led to a change inthis Order requiring fencing for all facilities, except flowlines, within\1/4\ mile of a town, city, or other high density population area. Dangersigns for flowlines will be required where such lines cross public or leaseroads. A number of comments were submitted on the issue of personnel protectionat production sites, with comments suggesting that more flexibility inthe use of equipment was necessary. Since this section of the previouslyproposed Order dealt solely with the question of personnel protection,including, ``non-essential'' personnel (i.e., those employees not responsiblefor maintaining control of the well and protecting public health and safety)and the subject of personnel protection necessary to protect public healthand safety is addressed in the Drilling Operations Plan, this section ofthe previously proposed Order has been deleted. A number of the comments expressed concern over the cost associated withthe proposed requirement for two master valves and subsurface automaticsafety valves. The comments questioned the reliability, need, and associatedcost-benefits of such a requirement. The point is acknowledged and, therefore,this proposed Order will require a secondary means of control through theChristmas tree for all wells and two master valves and an automatic safetyvalve will be required only when the public is potentially at risk. There were a number of comments concerning the proposed requirement inproposed Order No. 2 for use of corrosion coupons and H<T2>2</T2>S detectors. These requirements are adequately addressed by thePublic Protection Plan where the public is at risk and primarily constituterecommended practices. Therefore, this Order has deleted these requirements.Several comments were received regarding sulfur dioxide (SO<T2>2</T2>). This proposed Order amends the provisions that relate to SO<T2>2 </T2>so that anytime H<T2>2</T2>S is flared and SO<T2>2 </T2>results, the SO<T2>2 </T2>concentrations must be monitored and if the SO<T2>2 </T2>concentration exceeds the threshold level of 2 ppm in any occupiedresidence, school, church, park, playground, school bus stop, place ofbusiness, or area where the public could reasonably be expected to frequent,corrective action must be taken. This proposed Order sets forth in section IV the conditions whereby anoperator may request a variance from the requirements set out in the Order.All enforcement actions, reviews, and appeals taken pursuant to this proposedOrder would be subject to the regulations in 43 CFR subparts 3163 and 3165.The principal authors of this proposed rulemaking are Chris Hanson, Milwaukee,Wisconsin, James E. Rasmussen, formerly of Elko, Nevada, Hank Szymanski,Washington, D.C., William A. Douglas, Cheyenne, Wyoming, Ken Baker, GreatFalls, Montana, assisted by the Orders Task Group, Deborah Lanzone of theDivision of Legislation and Regulatory Management, all of the Bureau ofLand Management, and the staff of the Office of the Solicitor, Departmentof the Interior. It is hereby determined that this rulemaking does not constitute a majorFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environmentand that no detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under Executive Order 12291 and that it will not have a significanteconomic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). This proposed Order will have no adverse economic effects, since its requirementsreflect the operating practices currently followed by prudent operatorswhen conducting operations in hydrogen sulfide areas. It may provide abeneficial economic effect in that industry is less likely to be subjectedto assessments or penalties resulting from violations and/or the requirementto undertake costly remedial actions if it has a better understanding ofthe Bureau of Land Management's requirements relating to conducting H<T2>2</T2>S operations.

Section from 43 CFR Subparts 3163 and 3165. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Introduction </ITAG>A. Authority This Order is established pursuant to the authority granted to the Secretaryof the Interior through various Federal and Indian mineral leasing statutesand the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Managememt Act of 1982. This authorityhas been delegated to the Bureau of Land Management and is implementedby the onshore oil and gas operating regulations contained in 43 CFR Part3160. More specifically, this Order supplements and implements the provisionsof andSection; 3162.1_General Requirements; andSection; 3162.5-1(a)(c)(d)_EnvironmentalObligations; andSection; 3162.5-2(a)_Control of Wells; and andSection; 3162.5-3_SafetyPrecautions. 43 CFR 3164.1 specifically authorizes the Director, Bureau of Land Management,to issue Onshore Oil and Gas Orders, when necessary, to implement or supplementthe operating regulations and provides that all such Orders shall be bindingon the operator(s) of all Federal and Indian (except Osage Tribe) oil andgas leases which have been, or may hereafter be, issued. The authorizedofficer has the authority pursuant to 43 CFR 3161.2 to implement the provisionsof this Order, require additional information, and approve any plans, applications,or variances raquired or allowed by the Order.The authorized officer may, pursuant to 43 CFR 3164.2, issue Notices toLessees and Operators (NTL's), after notice and comment, to supplementor provide variances of this Order as necessary to accommodate specialconditions on a State or area-wide basis. Further information concerningvariances may be found in section IV. of this Order. B. Purpose The purpose of this Order is to protect public health and safety and thosepersonnel essential to maintaining control of the well. This Order identifiesthe Bureau of Land Management's uniform national requirements and minimumstandards of performance expected from operators when conducting operationsinvolving oil or gas that is known or could reasonably be expected to containhydrogen sulfide (H<T2>2</T2>S) or which results in the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO<T2>2</T2>) as a result of flaring H<T2>2</T2>S. This Order also identifies the probable corrective actions,normal abatement periods, and enforcement actions that will result whenviolations of the requirements and minimum standards are found and theviolations are not timely corrected. C. Scope This Order is applicable to all onshore Federal and Indian (except OsageTribe) oil and gas leases when drilling, completing, testing, reworking,producing, injecting, gathering, storing, or treating operations are beingconducted in zones which are known or could reasonably be expected to containH<T2>2</T2>S or which, when flared, could produce SO<T2>2</T2>, in such concentrations that upon release they could constitutea hazard to human life or property. The requirements and minimum standardsof this Order do not apply when operating in zones where H<T2>2</T2>S is presently known not to be present or cannot reasonably beexpected to be present in concentrations of 100 parts per million (ppm)or more in the gas stream. The requirements and minimum standards in this Order do not relieve anoperator from compliance with any applicable Federal, State, or local requirement(s)regarding H<T2>2</T2>S or SO<T2>2 </T2>which are more stringent. <ITAG tagnum="84">II.
