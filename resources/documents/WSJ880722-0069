Ernest Beazley (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> IAD AS </CO><IN> ERN MIN </IN><TEXT>   Three of the largest U.S. steelmakers posted huge second-quarter profits as the resurgent industry marched toward posting its best results in a decade.    Inland Steel Industries Inc., the nation's No. 4 steelmaker, said net income more than quadrupled to $79.9 million, or $2.27 a share, from $17.5 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. It was the best quarter in Chicago-based Inland's history.    Armco Inc., the No. 5 steelmaker, said its net jumped 12% to $40.4 million, or 44 cents a share, from $36.2 million, or 46 cents a share, even though non-recurring items contributed heavily to net a year earlier and its latest quarter included a $15 million charge. The company had 17% more shares outstanding in the second quarter than a year earlier.    Weirton Steel Corp., the nation's largest employee-owned industrial concern, said its operating profit jumped to $49.7 million from $41.1 million. For Weirton, the No. 7 steel company, that figure was the highest since its employees bought it in 1984.    Yesterday's results confirmed the continuing vigor in steel and other industrial commodities. Aided by high prices and robust demand, the steel industry is enjoying its highest profitability in modern times.    Several factors account for this: A weak dollar has touched off a rebound in manufacturing and capital goods, filling up order books; meanwhile, quotas on steel imports, higher demand and cuts in domestic capacity have led to shortages of steel.    Robert Hageman, a Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. analyst, said yesterday's results surpassed Wall Street's expectations. &quot;The figures are better than expected, and it looks like all the (industry's) figures are going to be high,&quot; he said.    Inland and Armco shares fell in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, a day on which the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 24.01 points. Inland closed at $36.375 a share, down 25 cents, and Armco fell 75 cents to $10.625. Weirton isn't publicly traded.    Inland's improvement reflected lower costs and stronger markets in flat-rolled steel, particularly for automakers. Sales rose 24% to a record $1.05 billion from $845.1 million, and shipments were up 12% to 1,340,000 tons.    The second-quarter figures also gave Inland its best six-month results ever, and Frank W. Luerssen, its chairman, predicted that Inland's earnings for the full year will be the highest in the company's history.    At Armco, based in Parsippany, N.J., sales jumped 15% to $826.7 million from $719.5 million. Operating profit doubled to $73.4 million as Armco benefited from higher prices and strong demand for more costly steels, especially in the auto market.    Weirton's results marked the 18th consecutive quarter in the black for the Weirton, W.Va., concern. Sales rose 8.3% to $348.7 million from $322 million. But earnings after employee profit-sharing deductions fell to $21.8 million from $23.8 million. The lower figure resulted from dividing 50% of the after-tax profits among employees, instead of 33% previously.    Second-half steel results typically soften because of a seasonal downturn in demand. Orders from the automobile, construction and capital goods industries tend to surge in late winter and spring as the industries gear up for peak production, then fall off in the summer.    Nonetheless, both Inland and Armco predicted strong second-half performances. Inland's Mr. Luerssen said he expects the company to exceed its earlier forecast of five million tons of shipments this year. He also said he expects the industry to ship almost 80 million tons this year, compared with 76.7 million last year.    Kidder's Mr. Hageman agreed that there's little to suggest that the industry's good times are about to wane. &quot;I don't see any signs of a lull or a dip coming,&quot; he said, predicting the industry will ship almost as much steel this quarter as in the period just ended.    But Herbert Elish, chairman of Weirton, said the normal summer slowdown in shipments is being exacerbated by the current drought over much of the central U.S. and some other areas. Specifically, he said, the drought is hurting agriculture and food-canning markets that are important to Weirton, a maker of tin plate for food cans. </TEXT></DOC>
