The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for whichthe tolerances are sought. The data submitted in support of the tolerancesinclude a 2-year oncogenicity study in mice fed dosages of 0, 150, 750,and 4,500 milligrams/kilogram/day (mg/kg/day) with an equivocal (uncertain)oncogenic effect at 4,500 mg/kg/day; a chronic feeding/oncogenicity studyin rats fed dosages of 0, 3, 10, and 31 mg/kg/day with no oncogenic effectsobserved under the conditions of the study at dose levels up to and including31 mg/kg/day (highest dose tested [HDT]) and a systemic no-observed-effectlevel (NOEL) of 31 mg/kg/day; a 1-year chronic oral study in dogs fed dosagelevels of 0, 20, 100, and 500 mg/kg/day with a NOEL of 500 mg/kg/day; ateratology study in rats given levels of 0, 300, 1,000 and 3,500 mg/kg/daywith no teratogenic effects occurring up to and including 3,500 mg/kg/day(HDT), maternal and fetotoxic NOELs of 1,000 mg/kg/day; a teratology studyin rabbits given dosage levels of 0, 75, 175, and 350 mg/kg/day with noteratogenic effects occurring up to and including 350 mg/kg/day (HDT),a maternal NOEL of 175 mg/kg/day, and a fetotoxic NOEL of 350 mg/kg/day(HDT); a three-generation reproduction study in rats fed dosage levelsof 0, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day with a NOEL of 10 mg/kg/day; a mutagenictest_chromosomal aberration <T3>in vitro</T3> (no aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells were causedwith and without S-9 activation); a mutagenic test_DNA repair in rat hepatocytes(negative); a mutagenicity test_<T3>in vivo</T3> bone marrow cytogenic in rats (negative); a mutagenicitytest_rec assay with <T3>B. subtilis</T3> (negative); a mutagenicity test_reverse mutation with<T3>S. typhimurium </T3>(negative); a mutagenicity (Ames) test with <T3>S. typhimurium</T3> (negative); and a dominant lethal mutagenicitytest in mice (negative).The acceptable daily intake (ADI) based on the three-generation rat reproductionstudy (NOEL of 10 mg/kg/day) and using a hundredfold safety factor is calculatedto be 0.1 mg/kg/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC)for published and unpublished but approved tolerances is 0.005094 mg/kg/day,which utilizes 5.0 percent of the ADI. This revision does not increasethe TMRC and will not increase the percentage of the ADI utilized.Desirable data lacking are a repeat of the mouse and rat oncogenicity studies.There are currently no actions pending against the continued registrationof this pesticide. No detectable residues of <T3>N</T3>-nitrosoglyphosate, a contaminant of glyphosate, are expectedto be present in the commodities for which tolerances are established.The oncogenic potential of glyphosate is not fully understood. Becauseof the equivocal (uncertain) nature of the oncogenic response in mice,the Agency referred the issue to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, andRodenticide Act (FIFRA) Science Advisory Panel (SAP) for a ``Weight ofthe Evidence'' classification. After reviewing all available evidence,the SAP proposed that glyphosate be classified as a ``Class D Oncogen''or having ``inadequate animal evidence of oncogenicity,'' and recommendeda Data Call-In for further studies in rats and/or mice to clarify unresolvedquestions. After a review of all available information, the Agency decidedto classify glyphosate as a ``Class D Oncogen'' and also to request a repeatof the mouse oncogenicity study. Because of the large difference betweenthe high dose tested in the rat and mouse oncogenicity studies, the ratoncogenicity study was rereviewed. The rereview indicated that a maximumtolerated dose (MTD) may not have been reached in that study. Therefore,the Agency decided to also request a repeat of the rat oncogenicity studyat doses high enough to reach an MTD. The Agency's policy has been to issuenew use registrations in which the resulting change in TMRC is less than1 percent; however, any significant new use registrations will be handledon a case-by-case basis and may not be issued until issues in the GlyphosateRegistration Standard have been resolved. Monsanto Co. has been notifiedof these conclusions and deficiencies by the Glyphosate Registration Standarddated June 30, 1986.The nature of the residue in plants is adequately understood, and an adequateanalytical method (gas-liquid chromatography with a flame photometric detector)is available for enforcement purposes in Volume II of the Food and DrugAdministration Pesticide Analytical Manual. The established toleranceson liver and kidney of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, poultry, and sheepare considered adequate to cover residues of glyphosate and AMPA resultingfrom the proposed use of glyphosate sodium sesqui salt on peanuts. Based on the information considered by the Agency, it is concluded thatthe tolerance established by amending 40 CFR Part 180 will protect thepublic health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below.Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days afterpublication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk,at the address given above. Such objections should specify the provisionsof the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections.If a hearing is requested, the objections must state the issues for thehearing and the grounds for the objections. A hearing will be granted ifthe objections are supported by grounds legally sufficient to justify therelief sought. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certificationstatement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 4, 1981 (40 FR 24950). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 9, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
