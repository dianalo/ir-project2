The Phoenix-based company announced Monday it was looking forbuyers, and Eller, chairman and chief operating officer, advisedCircle K's board of directors he may attempt a leveraged buyout.   ``I'm sure there's some poker involved here,'' said DennisTelzrow, vice president of research at Eppler, Guerin andamp; TurnerInc., in Dallas.   Christopher Vroom, an analyst with Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc., inBaltimore, said Eller's announcement ``creates a sense of urgencyin the minds of any potential buyer of Circle K. If they want tobuy circle K, they'd better step up to the plate now.''   Circle K's profits have fallen, and the company's long-term debtis nearly $1 billion, caused by agressive expansion, the ArizonaBusiness Gazette reported Monday.   Since Eller became chairman in 1983, the company has grown from1,221 stores in 11 states to a total of 4,687 outlets in 33 states.Only 450 of those were built by Circle K, the rest were purchasedin a series of acquisitions.   The company bought several smaller convenience-store chainsbetween 1983 and 1986, then last year acquired 473 7-Eleven storesfrom Dallas-based Southland Corp., incurring a $170 million debt.   It also last year acquired 538 Charter Marketing Co. conveniencestores for $70 million in cash and a new issue of convertiblepreferred stock.   To finance the buys, the company negotiated a $500 million loan,$250 million in long-term financing and $250 million in a revolvingcredit line, with a group of banks.   The company said in a statement Monday that it had received someinterest in possible acquisitions but no specific offers.   Analysts disagreed on whether Circle K likely would be bought bya major oil company. Of the 4,687 convenience stores the companyoperates, 3,600 have gas pumps.   Circle K's statement also said the company would continue tostudy possible dispositions of selected assets and other ways ofgaining capital.   A statement from the company said the loss comes from pressureon gasoline and general merchandise margins during the first twomonths of the year.   Circle K operates 4,687 convenience stores in 33 states and morethan 1,000 licensed or joint venture operations in 11 foreigncountries.</TEXT></DOC>
