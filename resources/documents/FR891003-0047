The FMPs were prepared by the NorthPacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the authority of theMagnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) and areimplemented by regulations for the foreign fishery at 50 CFR part 611 andfor the U.S. fishery at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675. At its January 16-19, 1989, meeting, the Council requested that NMFS preparea regulatory amendment so that a more permanent change could be made tothe regulatory text concerning directed fishing than that afforded by anemergency rule that was in effect from March 28 through September 23, 1989(see 54 FR 13191, March 31, 1989; 54 FR 27384, June 29, 1989). The emergencyrule modified the definition of directed fishing with respect to enforcementand also limited the amount of sablefish caught in the Bering Sea and AleutianIslands area (BSAI) to 10 percent of Greenland turbot and Pacific oceanperch, and 1 percent of other groundfish, retained on board a vessel. TheCouncil also requested that NMFS develop and include in the regulatoryamendment definitions specific to the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) sablefish trawlfishery and the various BSAI groundfish fisheries. The Council intends that amounts of groundfish species that are not availablefor a directed fishery should be caught only in amounts necessary to supportdirected fisheries for other groundfish species. At the same time, theCouncil does not intend that occasional catches of groundfish incidentalto other directed fisheries should be discarded at sea and wasted unnecessarily.To the contrary, the Council recognizes that, given the variable compositionof groundfish species in the ecosystem, fishermen can be expected to inadvertentlycatch other species while conducting directed fishing for a particularspecies. The Council intends that fishermen should be given the chanceto adjust fishing practices during the course of a trip such that the resultingcomposition of the total catch at the end of the trip would not violatea directed fishing closure. The Council often expressed this intent at its April 11-14, 1989, meetingduring its review of the regulatory amendment drafted by NMFS. The Councilheard testimony from fishing industry representatives concerning the needfor a time period in which to adjust catches so that resulting catch fora species for which directed fishing had been prohibited would not violatea directed fishing closure. Other industry representatives testified thatfishermen should not be allowed to retain amounts of groundfish on boardafter the date of the last offloading or transfer, because large amountsof groundfish for which directed fishing had been prohibited could be caughtand retained without being in violation. As a result, these species ofgroundfish could be taken in excessively disproportionate amounts as allowablebycatch and cause the total allowable catch (TAC) to be reached beforethe fishing year ended. In such cases, additional catches of these specieswould have to be treated as prohibited species and discarded at sea aswaste. Finally, other industry representatives testified that groundfishcaught in another GOA regulatory area or district, or BSAI subarea, shouldnot be considered for purposes of calculating percentages used in the definition,again, because larger amounts of groundfish for which a directed fisheryhad been closed could otherwise be caught, causing the TAC to be reachedtoo early. <ITAG tagnum="84">Council Recommendations </ITAG>After considering testimony, the Council recommended that the regulatoryamendment be implemented, but with the following changes: 1. The definition should be based on amounts of fish caught since the dateof last offloading rather than on a haul or set basis, which would allowfishermen to adjust amounts of bycatch species over the time period ofthe trip; 2. Percentages used to define directed fishing should be  reduced whereappropriate to remove economic incentives to target on bycatch species,but not reduced so low as to require excessive discard of bycatch speciesand resultant wastage; 3. Fish and fish products retained onboard a vessel from a prior trip shouldnot be used for purposes of calculating a percentage of a species whendetermining compliance with a directed fishing closure during a subsequenttrip; and 4. Fish and fish products onboard a vessel that were caught in anotherGOA regulatory area or district, or BSAI subarea, should not be used forpurposes of calculating a percentage when determining compliance with adirected fishing closure. <ITAG tagnum="84">Definitions </ITAG>The definitions of directed fishing are specified in the relevant fishingregulations (see 50 CFR 672.2 for GOA groundfish and 50 CFR 675.2 for BSAIgroundfish and 50 CFR 611 for foreign fishing). The codified definitionsof directed fishing for both GOA and BSAI groundfish read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Directed Fishing, </T3>with respect to any species, stock or otheraggregation of fish, means fishing that is intended or can reasonably beexpected to result in the catching, taking or harvesting of quantitiesof such fish that amount to 20 percent or more of the catch, take, or harvest,or to 20 percent or more of the total amount of fish or fish products onboard at any time. It will be a rebuttable presumption that, when any species,stock, or other aggregation of fish comprises 20 percent or more of thecatch, take, or harvest, or 20 percent or more of the total amount of fishor fish products on board at any time, such fishing was directed to fishingfor such fish.</ITAG>The codified definition of directed fishing applicable to foreign fishingis different and is specified under 50 CFR part 611. These codified definitions were superseded temporarily by emergency ruleto allow time for the preparation of a regulatory amendment to resolvethis issue (see 54 FR 13191, March 31, 1989; 54 FR 27384, June 29, 1989).The definition of foreign fishing was revised temporarily to be consistentwith the appropriate temporary definitions. These temporary definitionsare effective through September 23, 1989. The definition of directed fishing has been a contentious issue. Underthe codified definitions, catches of species for which directed fishingis prohibited are compared against catches of other fish over any periodon an individual haul or set basis, as well as against the total amountof fish on board. If a fisherman catches groundfish species for which directedfishing is  prohibited in an amount greater than an allowable percentage,the fisherman may be charged with a violation. Fishing industry representativescomplain that they may be liable for their catches before they have hadthe chance to observe and sort them. If a catch is brought on board a vesseland a particular groundfish species is observed by enforcement officersto be in excess of the maximum allowable percentage of total catch, thevessel operator could be cited. The industry has contended that the codifieddefinitions of directed fishing create potential enforcement standardsthat are too burdensome. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed rules </ITAG>Although the codified definition in the Code of Federal Regulations wasintended to encourage fishermen to modify fishing practices when excessiveamounts of bycatch might result, the Secretary recognizes the bycatch permittedunder these definitions is too high in many cases and further recognizesthe burden that these definitions has imposed on fishermen who may notbe aware of the true composition of their catches until they have observedthem after retrieving their gear. The Secretary, therefore, proposes arule that replaces the directed fishing definition and implements directedfishing standards for various groundfish species and gear types. Pertinent to the Council's recommendations are the following three aspectsof the proposed rule: (1) The standards would be enforced on a trip basis, which means that fishermenwould be held accountable for catches during the period of time since thedate of last offloading or transfer of any fish or fish products, or untilthe vessel leaves the GOA regulatory area or district or BSAI subarea inwhich fishing commenced, which ever occurred first. Fishermen would beallowed to adjust catches of a species and the amounts of a species thatare retained would be compared against other species and the total amountof fish and fish products retained during the same trip in determiningwhether the vessel was engaged in directed fishing. (2) Any catches retained on board from a prior trip would not be used tocompare the amounts of a particular species to other species and to thetotal amount of fish retained during a subsequent trip. A vessel is engagedin a single fishing trip from the commencement of any fishing activityuntil any offload or transfer of any fish or fish product from that vessel,or until the vessel leaves the GOA regulatory area or district or BSAIsubarea where fishing activities commenced, whichever occurs first.(3) The amount of a species caught in a GOA regulatory area or districtor BSAI subarea can only be compared with amounts of other species andthe total amount of fish and fish products on board a vessel that werecaught in the same regulatory area or district or subarea. Thus, fishermenwould not be allowed to calculate the percentage of a species caught inone regulatory area or district or subarea using amounts of fish and fishproducts from  another regulatory area or district or subarea. As discussed below, proposed percentages used in the directed fishing standardsare reduced from the codified definitions where necessary to better reflectnatural rates of catch. Fishermen would have little economic incentive,if any, to target on species for which directed fishing is prohibited.As a result, if the Secretary prohibited directed fishing for a speciesfor purposes of extending harvest of such species over a longer time period,it also would delay the point at which the species must be discarded atsea and result in reduced resource wastage. The Secretary has made a preliminarydetermination that this proposed rule is superior to the status quo andis consistent with the goals and objectives of both groundfish FMPs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Editorial and related changes </ITAG>The form of the proposed rule differs in several respects from the Councilrecommendations but is essentially the same in  substance except as otherwisenoted. The proposed rules establish standards for directed fishing. Thisapproach is more flexible and will be more likely to accommodate futurerevisions. The actual percentages recommended by the Council are not changedexcept as indicated in the discussion on percentages below. In addition,the numbering and paragraph designations for various provisions are revised,some provisions are combined, and a variety of other minor  revisions areincluded to ensure consistency, to provide clarity, and to accomplish theintent of the Council. For example, subparagraphs within the redesignatedparagraph andSection; 672.20(c)(3), <T3>Notices of closure,</T3> in 50 CFR part 672 are changed by renumberingand by removing the word ``directed.'' This word makes this paragraph confusing,since it references management responses appropriate when the TAC for anytarget species or the ``other species'' category has been reached and hasbeen declared a prohibited species. <ITAG tagnum="84">Percentages </ITAG>Recommendations made by the Council to change certain percentages usedto determine whether a vessel is engaged in directed fishing in the Gulfof Alaska are limited to sablefish caught with trawl gear. Council recommendationsfor the BSAI are pertinent to all species. Gulf of Alaska Groundfish Sablefish typically are caught incidentally while targeting with trawlgear for flounder, rockfish, pollock, and Pacific cod. The Council consideredrecommendations from its Advisory Panel, as well as testimony presentedby the public, about the percentage of sablefish that ought to be usedto define directed fishing for sablefish in the GOA by vessels using trawlgear. The Council recommended that the directed  fishing percentage shouldbe 5 percent or more for all groundfish species, except for Dover soleand Rex sole and rockfish of the genera <T3>Sebastes</T3> and <T3>Sebastolobus.</T3> For the exceptions, the directed fishing percentshould be no less than 15 percent. The Council recommended this percentageto accommodate higher bycatch rates of sablefish in fisheries for Doversole, Rex sole, and rockfish. The Secretary proposes a directed fishing standard for sablefish caughtwith trawl gear in the GOA based upon 5 percent of all fish and fish productsexcluding rockfish of the genera <T3>Sebastes</T3> and <T3>Sebastolobus,</T3> for which the percentage is 15 percent. The Secretaryis not proposing the Council's recommended percentage of Dover sole andRex sole at this time. A definition of directed fishing for any speciesmust be tied to an established TAC for that species. Since only a singleTAC is specified for the flatfish complex, only a single definition ofdirected fishing for sablefish is proposed when compared to amounts offlatfish. Prior to the Council's recommendations, NMFS had calculated that the definitionof sablefish directed fishing ought to be at least 20 percent of rockfishand 10 percent of pollock and Pacific cod on the basis of the EA/RIR, usingthe high end in the data range. However, the recommendations of the Councilalso reasonably approximate the low end in the data range. The Council'srecommendations for lower percentages are intended to reduce economic incentivessuch that individual vessels would not be encouraged to target on speciesfor which directed fishing is prohibited. The Secretary, on the basis ofthe EA/RIR, concurs with the Council recommendation and proposes 15 percentto define directed fishing for sablefish when compared to amounts of rockfishon board but proposes a definition of 5 percent of all the other fish andfish products. For sablefish caught with hook-and-line gear, the retention of sablefishin an amount that constitutes 4 percent or more of all fish and fish productsretained during that trip constitutes directed fishing for sablefish. Forall other species of groundfish, the retention of a species or speciesgroup in an amount that equals or exceeds 20 percent of all fish and fishproducts retained during the same trip constitutes directed fishing forthat species or species group. Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Groundfish The Council reviewed bycatch percentages recommended by NMFS to definedirected fishing. Amounts of fish and fish products retained on board thatare equal to, or greater than, these percentages would be considered tobe directed fishing. With the exception of a sablefish bycatch percentagein rockfish and Greenland turbot fisheries, the Council adopted the recommendedpercentages. Although NMFS had determined that the sablefish bycatch percentagecould be up to 25 percent of Greenland turbot and up to 15 percent of rockfish,the Council adopted 10 percent for both Greenland turbot and rockfish asrecommended by the Advisory Panel and public testimony. The higher percentagesrecommended by NMFS represent the high end of the data range. However,the recommendations of the Council also reasonably approximate the lowend of the data range. As with the standard for directed fishing proposedfor sablefish caught with trawl gear in the Gulf of Alaska, the Councilintends that the percentages be lower to remove economic incentives totarget on species closed to directed fishing.The bycatch percentages in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands groundfishfisheries were examined by gear type and by target fishery. The Secretarynotes that these percentages vary among areas and seasons fished. Annualvariation is likely, too, if stocks of any species vary substantially inabundance. As bycatch species fluctuate in abundance, changes in bycatchrates should show the same trend. For example, when sablefish is abundant,then sablefish bycatch rates would be higher for each gear type. If sablefishis not abundant, then sablefish bycatch rates would be lower. This variability presents practical problems that must be considered whenproposing bycatch rates for the fisheries. Although different bycatch ratesfor different times of the fishing year and for each area might be observed,the accounting by enforcement officers for discrepancies in apparent catcheson board fishing vessels at this level of refinement is not feasible withoutinordinate management costs. Consequently, the Secretary is proposing percentagesthat are aggregated, using data from the combined statistical areas 51-54of the International North Pacific Fishery Commission. Although percentageswere examined for trends, no obvious patterns were detected to warrantregulation of bycatches differently during seasons of the year. Bycatch rates among the gear types are expected to be independent. Consequently,bycatch percentages for trawl, hook-and-line, and pot gear are summarizedand proposed independently. <ITAG tagnum="84">Monitoring and Enforcement </ITAG>Compliance with the directed fishing standards would be monitored throughthe review of catches retained during a trip through a review of the amountsof fish and fish products on board a vessel at the completion of a trip.Part of the latter review would likely be accomplished by reviewing thevessel's catch, production, and offloading records. Although a number ofspecific percentages are used in the standards for directed fishing, accountingis done the same way. For example, if directed fishing for pollock is prohibitedin a particular area, then a boarding officer would calculate the roundweight equivalents for all species recorded to have been caught in thatarea during a trip, other than ``other flatfish'', Pacific cod, and yellowfinsole, and multiply the sum by 1 percent. Then, the boarding officer wouldcalculate the sum of the round weight of ``other flatfish'', Pacific cod,and yellowfin sole caught in the same area during the trip and multiplythat sum by 20 percent. The sum of the two results would be compared tothe amount of pollock retained in that area during the trip. If the amountof pollock exceeded the sum, that vessel would have violated the directedfishing closure for pollock.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined that thisrule is necessary for the conservation and management of the groundfishfisheries off Alaska and that it is consistent with the Magnuson Act andother applicable law. The Alaska Region, NMFS, prepared an environmental assessment for thisrule that discusses the environmental, social, and economic impacts onthe human environment that will occur as a result of this rule. You mayobtain a copy of the EA/RIR/IRFA from the Regional Director at the addressabove. The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, NOAA, (Under Secretary)determined that this proposed rule is not a ``major rule'' requiring aregulatory impact analysis under Executive Order 12291. This determinationis based on the socioeconomic impacts discussed in the EA/RIR/IRFA preparedby the Alaska Region, NMFS. The Alaska Region, NMFS, prepared an initial regulatory flexibility analysisas part of the regulatory impact review, which concludes that this proposedrule, if adopted, could have significant economic impacts on a substantialnumber of small entities. Implementation and enforcement of a bycatch definitionthat is based on a trip basis instead of an individual haul or set basisis better for small entities than the status quo because it will allowfishermen to sort their catch over a period of time to accomplish the objectivethat the amount of bycatch retained is within the allowable percentage.The reduced percentages are superior to the status quo, because  they reflectmore accurately amounts of groundfish actually needed as bycatch and willreduce the amount of groundfish discarded at sea as prohibited species.This rule does not contain a collection of information requirement subjectto the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Under Secretary has determined that this rule will be implemented ina manner that is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with theapproved coastal zone management program of the State of Alaska. This determinationhas been submitted for review by the responsible State agencies under section307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act. This proposed rule does not contain policies with federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment under ExecutiveOrder 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Parts 611, 672, and 675 </ITAG>Fisheries.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 26, 1989.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.

The amount of a species or species groupapportioned to a fishery is the amount under table 1, as revised by inseasonadjustments, for that species or species group, as identified by subareaand as further identified according to any allocation for TALFF, the apportionmentfor JVP, the apportionment for DAP and, if applicable, as further identifiedby gear type. In establishing a directed fishing allowance, the RegionalDirector shall consider the amount of that species or species group whichwill be taken as bycatch in directed fishing for other species in the samesubarea. If the Regional Director establishes a directed fishing allowanceand that allowance is, or will be, reached, he will prohibit directed fishingfor that species or species group in the specified subarea. No person mayengage in directed fishing in violation of an applicable notice. If directedfishing is prohibited, the amount of any catch of that species or speciesgroup equal to or greater than the amount which constitutes directed fishingmay not be retained and must be treated as a prohibited species under paragraph(c) of this section. <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(h) <T3>Standards for directed fishing_</T3>(1) <T3>Using trawl gear for pollock.</T3> The operator of a vessel is engagedin the directed fishing for pollock if at the completion of a trip pollockcaught using trawl gear is retained on the vessel in an amount equal toor greater than: (i) 20 percent of the amount of all ``other rockfish'', Pacific cod, andyellowfin sole retained on the vessel during the same trip; plus (ii) 1 percent of the total amount of all fish species not identified underparagraph (h)(l)(i) of this section retained on the vessel during the sametrip.
