In the 1950s, Ike backed America's words withmuscle. In the 1960s, West Berliners took heart, when John F.Kennedy said: I am a Berliner. In the 1970s, Presidents Nixon, Fordand Carter stood with Berlin _ by standing with NATO. And in the1980s, Ronald Reagan went to Berlin to say: Tear down this wall.   Now we are at the threshold of the 1990s. And as we begin thenew decade, I am reaching out to President Gorbachev, asking him towork with me to bring down the last barriers to a new world offreedom. Let us move beyond containment, and once and for all endCold War.   We can make such a bold bid because America is strong, and 40years of perseverance and patience are finally paying off. Morerecently, quiet diplomacy, working behind the scenes, has achievedresults. We can now dare to imagine a new world, with a new Europe,rising on the foundations of democracy.   This new world was taking shape when my presidency began withthese words: ``The day of the dictator is over.'' During the springand summer we told the people of the world what America believes,and what America wants for the future. America believes that``liberty is an idea whose time has come in Eastern Europe.''America wants President Gorbachev's reforms, known as perestroika,to succeed. And America wants the Soviets to join us, in moving``beyond containment,'' to a new partnership. Some wondered if allthis was realistic. Now, though we are still on the course set lastspring, events are moving faster than anyone imagined or predicted.   Look around the world _ in the developing nations, the peopleare demanding freedom. Poland and Hungary are now fledglingdemocraties _ a non-communist government in Poland, and freeelections coming soon in Hungary. And in the Soviet Union itself,the forces of reform under Mikhail Gorbachev are bringingunprecedented openness and change.   But nowhere in the world today _ or even in the history of Man _have the warm hearts of men and women triumphed so swiftly _ socertainly _ over cold stone _ as in Berlin. Indeed, in all of EastGermany. If I may paraphrase the words of a great poet, RobertFrost: There is certainly something in us that doesn't love a wall.   When I spoke to the German people in Mainz last May, I applaudedthe removal of the barriers between Hungary and Austria, saying:``Let Berlin be next.'' And the West German people joined us in acall for a Europe whole and free.   Just yesterday, the West German Foreign Minister gave me a pieceof the Berlin Wall _ it is on my desk as a reminder of the power offreedom to bring down the walls between people.   It brought back memories of seven years ago, when I went toModlareuth, a small town in Germany also known as Little Berlin. Adivided village, really, its cobbled streets blocked by barbed wireand concrete _ on the one side freedom, on the other despair. Italked with the townspeople, not a hundred and fifty yards from thespecter of armed guards in towers. Some day I'd like to go back toLittle Berlin, and see families reunited, see neighbors once apart,coming together.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
