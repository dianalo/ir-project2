Segal Opens His 20th-Century Tribute </HL><AUTHOR> Meg Cox (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AXP SLH </CO><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   &quot;Marty's Party&quot; could easily enough turn out not to be &quot;the celebration of the century.&quot; Marty is self-made millionaire, Russian emigre businessman Martin E. Segal, the former chairman of Lincoln Center. His party is the First New York International Festival of the Arts, an affair that's supposed to captivate New York City for a month starting tomorrow, with 4,000 performers from 30 countries putting on 350 events.    All of which is supposed to be good: for the arts, for international relations, for tourism in the city and for American Express. A heavy burden, all things considered.    The festival, though imminent, doesn't seem to be entirely ready. And New York, awash in the arts all the time, tends to be blase about these things. So the question arises: Will New York notice? So far, there hasn't been much of an air of anticipation.    Events are to include the first all-female African orchestra; an underwater dance by a French troupe; and a theater piece by the national poet of Indonesia. Lasers will shine on the city nightly. And in the end, Placido Domingo and Linda Ronstadt will sing free in Central Park.    Something for everyone -- Venetian gondolas even. Although technically the shindig is supposed to celebrate 20th-century art, the execution of the theme looks a bit diffuse. And much of the advance word has been pretty cynical. The Village Voice, for one, is calling it &quot;The Festival That Ate New York,&quot; though any such conclusion is clearly premature.    Will people come? Even with American Express trying to convince millions of card holders world-wide that tickets to this festival are privileges of membership, ticket sales have dragged.    Not that there won't be plenty of premieres, specially commissioned work and loads of fun. But a lot of festival events were going to take place even if this festival hadn't come along and swooped them up. Some arts administrators with productions subsumed by the festival complain privately that the thing lacks focus and vision. But they won't say so on the record.    Many festivals fully underwrite the productions they present, but Mr. Segal cannily designed this one as an &quot;umbrella,&quot; providing a context and marketing but just a bit of the money for most events. That has made the festival all the bigger, if not necessarily the better, and it has left the risks to be carried by sometimes-fragile non-profit arts groups, which may end up in the red.    The practice could even have a passing deleterious effect on Soviet-American relations, embarrassing so soon after President Reagan's return from Moscow.    New York producer Ken Marsolais planned to put on &quot;Brothers and Sisters,&quot; a seven-hour epic in Russian, which was to open next week on Broadway. He ran short of money and canceled the show as the sets sat on a New York dock and actors in Moscow waited to get on a plane.    On Wednesday, the Russian group's literary manager, Mikhail Stronin, came here to beg Mr. Segal for a bailout, but he refused them. &quot;Mr. Segal says he only gives an umbrella for the festival,&quot; says Mr. Stronin. &quot;In this case, his umbrella has lots of holes. I told him this could be taken as a political maneuver, and he said he can't help what people think. We are angry, but we aren't giving up.&quot;    Mr. Segal replies: &quot;The producer didn't produce -- it's as simple as that.&quot; He says he told Mr. Stronin, &quot;Look, the president didn't call me from Moscow, and neither did Gorbachev. We didn't invite you for political reasons but for artistic reasons.&quot;    The Russians are now hoping to hastily substitute a cheaper-to-produce play about prostitutes in the Soviet Union that has just finished a successful run in Toronto. They hope to open June 20.    Mr. Segal defends his festival generally. Let people call it Marty's Party if they want to, Mr. Segal says. &quot;We had to be huge,&quot; he says. &quot;If this festival had 25 events, it would be meaningless.&quot;    A charming, intelligent man of 72 who always wears a red rosebud in his lapel, Mr. Segal says his goals are &quot;artistic excellence, international amity and economic advances in tourism.&quot; As he explains it, &quot;Our city has increasingly become a service city, and service cities depend on amenities to attract people. We don't have ski slopes.&quot;    At a cost of $8.5 million, privately raised by Mr. Segal, the festival is supposed to generate half a billion tourist dollars. Helping that to happen, American Express gave $3 million to the festival and sent millions of card holders brochures and travel packages. Festival posters were put up in 1,500 American Express travel offices around the world. Special telephone operators were hired to take ticket orders and trained to pronounce the difficult Russian and Chinese names of performers.    But tickets are moving slowly for many of the events. At the 92nd Street Y, which is putting on concerts and a modern, adult puppet show, press director Susan Glass says, &quot;Frankly, I think it is almost too much and too massive for the public to comprehend this festival.&quot;    Others involved express skepticism, too. &quot;We might not have been able to do this project without the grant, but ticket sales aren't great,&quot; says Ann Eakland of Mabou Mines, a New York experimental theater group doing a play called &quot;Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said.&quot; She continues: &quot;I felt like we were really lost in the marketing materials.&quot;    Mr. Segal says that many people won't buy tickets before reviews start appearing. But, he insists, it doesn't matter whether ticket sales aren't spectacular or whether certain events have to be canceled: The festival, which is supposed to be repeated in 1990, will have to prove itself over time. &quot;Everything will be forgotten except what happens on stage,&quot; he says.    But even if festival events get great notices and are enjoyed by audiences, which is entirely possible, there are some things Mr. Segal won't live down soon.    Take the gondolas. Mr. Segal chose as the festival's theme the performing arts of the 20th century. He stuck in opera, film, dance, music, theater and television. In an effort to be pure about it, he wouldn't let Leonard Bernstein conduct music written in the 1880s. An avant-garde Swedish-language production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; directed by Ingmar Bergman and appearing at the Brooklyn Academy of Music was also excluded, once again on 20th-century grounds.    But in what is being called a prologue to the festival, Mr. Segal and Mayor Ed Koch will be at the South Street Seaport tonight to meet three gondolas, which Venetians even now are paddling down the Hudson River. It turns out that Mr. Segal had taken some heat from the U.S. ambassador to Italy, Maxwell Rabb, after a planned visit by Teatro Milano fell through because Mr. Segal wouldn't put up $950,000. As a sop to the ambassador, Mr. Segal agreed to squeeze in the gondolas, announcing that they would &quot;symbolically deliver the performing arts of the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th centuries&quot; to the festival. &quot;Everybody thought that was amusing,&quot; Mr. Segal insists. &quot;And the Italians are paying for it.&quot;    Mr. Segal's frayed relationship with the Metropolitan Opera won't be so easily mended. He had wanted to use the Met's hall for a fund-raising gala, but the Met worried that it would conflict with a gala of its own for the Paris Opera Ballet. Mr. Segal, feeling that the Met should have told him of the overlap, went behind the Met's back and tried to undo the Met's lese majesty by persuading French officials to postpone the ballet's visit. Mr. Segal didn't succeed, and he will hold his party in a tent at Lincoln Center. &quot;There were a couple of glitzy types {at the Met} who were more concerned about their benefit than with international relationships,&quot; Mr. Segal says.    Harvey Lichtenstein, creator of the hip annual &quot;Next Wave&quot; festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, says Mr. Segal may prove critics wrong. &quot;New York can be so provincial; it thinks it has everything, which isn't true,&quot; says Mr. Lichtenstein. &quot;Let's just relax and give this festival a chance.&quot;    Not so sanguine is Christopher Hunt, who has managed to make the Summerfare festival, produced by PepsiCo each July in Purchase, N.Y., a big draw for arts-minded New Yorkers. &quot;Festivals in big cities just don't work,&quot; he says. &quot;The biggest question is whether treating the arts as a vehicle for something else -- even tourism benefiting the city -- doesn't encourage a trashy attitude toward the arts and debase them.&quot;    Composer Gian Carlo Menotti doesn't approve, either. &quot;New York is an art festival all year round,&quot; he says. &quot;This is like trying to give a charming party in Grand Central Station.&quot; Mr. Menotti founded the highly successful Spoleto festivals in Italy and Charleston, S.C., and would have been happy to lend the New York festival a hand, too. He was listed on its stationery as an adviser, but he says nobody ever asked his advice. </TEXT></DOC>
