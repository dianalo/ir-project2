U.S. District Judge Charles B. Richey, in issuing a 10-daytemporary restraining order, ruled that the overnight curfew lawcould unfairly penalize thousands of youths and result in``permanent and irreparable injury'' to those detained unfairlyunder the anti-drug trafficking statute.   His ruling came despite an argument by district officials thatthe city's record murder rate required immediate action.   ``These are desperate times, and they require what may well beconsidered desperate measures,'' argued Robin Alexander-Smith,assistant corporation counsel. ``You see it on TV every night _ thecriminal element has taken over the streets ... and is seducing thechildren.''   The district has recorded 119 homicides this year, up from 73 forthe same period last year. For all of 1988, there were 372homicides, an all-time high.   The District of Columbia Council last week passed an emergencylaw banning teen-agers under the age of 18 from gathering on citystreets after 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and after midnightFriday and Saturday. The curfew would have ended at 6 a.m. each day.It was designed to keep young people from buying or selling drugs oncity street corners or open-air drug markets.   Enforcement was scheduled to begin Monday night, even thoughMayor Marion Barry Jr. and Corporation Counsel Fred Cookeacknowledged that the plan might violate constitutional guaranteesof freedom of assembly and privacy rights.   ``To enact a law that raises serious constitutional questionswhen (city officials) know themselves it will not work ... gives mechills,'' the judge said.   Cooke also had said the bill might not slow the pace ofdrug-related shootings, since police statistics indicate that theaverage ages of murder victims and perpetrators in the nation'scapital are both over 30.   The American Civil Liberties Union asked that the curfew be ruledunconstitutional, claiming that it unfairly prevented thousands ofcity teens from attending church, school or other legitimatefunctions late at night.   ``This curfew was a reaction to this problem, not a solution,''said Arthur Spitzer, legal director for the ACLU's National Capitalchapter. ``It will hardly deter a teen-ager bent on committing acrime. It will deter law-abiding teen-agers from going about theirbusiness.''   Richey said he was also worried that those detained while waitingfor a bus or coming home from a school play would have what amountedto a police record that could harm their future employment oreducational prospects.   A police enforcement order indicated that those detained wouldnot formally be charged, but still would have their fingerprintstaken and their names entered into a permanent police data bank.   ``Once those names get in there, how do you get them out?''Richey asked.   Barry, anticipating legal opposition to the plan, last weekdrafted an alternative bill. Richey ruled that he might extend therestraining order indefinitely if Barry's alternative bill is notsatisfactory.   Barry's bill includes a broad range of exemptions from thecurfew, including starting the curfew at 11:45 p.m. to allowteen-agers time to return home from social events.   In addition, it includes a blanket exemption for those returningfrom school or church functions and those traveling with parents orguardians.   Barry's bill also attempts to resolve a conflict withconstitutional freedom of assembly guarantees by allowing forteen-agers to gather on city streets during curfew hours forprotests or forums, provided that police officials have beennotified first.   Both bills penalize parents, not the teen-agers. Starting withthe second offense, parents would be forced to pay a series ofgraduated fines ranging from $200 to $500.</TEXT></DOC>
