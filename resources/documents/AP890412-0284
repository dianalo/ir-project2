DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ivan F. Boesky asked a federal judge to end histhree-year prison term but prosecutors Wednesday refused to take astand on releasing the former speculator at the center of WallStreet's insider trading scandals.   Boesky, who has already served one year in prison, claimed thathis help led to a record plea bargain deal by Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc. and the subsequent indictment of its junk bondfinancier Michael Milken and others on racketeering and securitiesfraud charges.   Boesky's lawyers on Tuesday asked U.S. District Judge Morris E.Lasker to reduce his sentence to time already served, which wouldallow his speedy release.   ``The true fruits of Ivan Boesky's unsurpassed cooperation withthe government are now _ for the first time _ dramatically, fullyand publicly known,'' the court papers said.   The papers claimed Boesky was ``to a significant extent afollower in a larger criminal conspiracy organized and operated''by Drexel and its high-yield bond department headed by Milken.   The 98-count indictment of Milken, handed up March 29, allegedthat the Drexel bondsman illegally schemed with Boesky to defraudclients and the investing public by manipulating stock prices andskirting federal securities laws during attempted takeovers.   In a letter to Lasker, who sentenced Boesky in December 1987,the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office said ``the government takes noposition'' on Boesky's move, but acknowledged his cooperation inthe almost three-year probe into Wall Street corruption.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jess Fardella, writing on behalf of U.S.Attorney Benito Romano, noted that ``the fruits of his cooperationare now more vividly apparent to the public.''   Fardella described the Milken indictment and the $650 milliontentative settlement of criminal charges Drexel reached with thegovernment as ``the centerpiece of Boesky's cooperation.''   The letter continued: ``Boesky's disclosures were the essentialcatalyst for all that has been and remains to be revealed in thosecases. Other investigations arising directly from Boesky'sdisclosures have also matured since Boesky's sentencing.''   But it added that ``the government nevertheless articulated thevalue of that cooperation in unqualified terms when Boesky wassentenced.''   Boesky attorney Leon Silverman said: ``I will have no commentwhile it's under consideration by the court.''   Once one of the leading speculators on the stock of potentialtakeover targets, Boesky pleaded guilty to one felony count as partof his plea bargain. Boesky, 52, also agreed to pay a then-record$100 million to settle civil insider trading charges brought by theSecurities and Exchange Commission.   On April 15, 1988, Boesky filed papers seeking a sentencereduction but asked Lasker to defer action. Attorneys againdeferred the request in October and said last week they planned toseek his release following Milken's long-awaited indictment.   The lawyers Tuesday said that ``public `blood lust''' at thetime of sentencing couldn't be countered.   ``As the court recognized at sentencing, it was impossible forthe public or the press to understand the incalculable value of Mr.Boesky's cooperation because the secrecy of the grand jury processprecluded any public recitation of the value of the informationthat he had provided to the government,'' it said.   Boesky was eligible for parole March 21, two days before hisone-year anniversary inside the minimum security prison camp inLompoc, Calif., where the one-time corporate titan is working as anorderly. he has not yet sought parole.   Boesky has supplied information used toward civil or criminalcharges in more than a dozen case in the United States and Britain.In exchange, Boesky was allowed to plead guilty to one count ofconspiracy to lie to the SEC. His earliest non-parole release datebased on good behavior is April 4, 1990.   At the time of sentencing, prosecutors said Boesky's three-yearterm ``was an appropriate sentence in light of all the competingfactors.''   They also said that while Boesky provided a ``window on therampant criminal conduct'' in the securities industry he also``engaged in serious and widespread criminal conduct.''</TEXT></DOC>
