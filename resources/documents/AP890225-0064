Students hurling firebombs and rocks battled riot police in minorrunning clashes in some provincial cities. Thousands of riot policeblocked demonstrations, often forming a human wall with shields todisperse protesters. Dissident groups had called for nationwideprotests Saturday to demand the fall of President Roh Tae-woo'sgovernment and to protest Bush's visit Monday. But turnout was smalland riot police overwhelmed the few thousand people who took part.   Authorities said police would remain on top alert becausedissidents have called for more protests Monday. Radicals aredemanding an end to close ties with the United States and removal of42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.   The nation's largest dissident alliance, the United NationalDemocratic Movement of Korea, demanded Bush cancel a visit it saidwas designed to bolster the Roh government. Bush is to visit Seoulfor about five hours to hold talks with Roh and address the NationalAssembly.   ``The United States is scheming, through Bush's visit, toperpetuate the division of the Korean peninsula, stabilize themilitary dictatorship and heighten tensions,'' the movement said.
