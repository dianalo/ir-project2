Soon they can add Israeli cheeses, tea biscuits and goose liver pate to their cosmopolitan shopping lists. That's right, Israeli. This spring, Americans will get their first taste of a line of 25 gourmet food and beverage products made by several different companies in Israel but all marketed under the newly created brand name Betavon.    &quot;We have organized a cooperative and intend to break into the fast-growing gourmet market,&quot; says Melinda Ballard, president of Ficom International Inc., a New York marketing and public relations firm that dreamed up Betavon. &quot;Too many Israeli manufacturers have gotten stuck in a rut selling kosher foods to the tiny Jewish market in the U.S.&quot;    Indeed, Israel is better known for its expertise in making military and electronic equipment and such consumer goods as Gottex swimsuits than it is for cooking up mouth-watering food. But Betavon Co. and another recently formed U.S. importing company believe they can whet America's appetite for Israeli foods. The other company, I/AM Importing (I for Israel, Am for America), is headed by Murray Lender, who ran Lender's Bagel Bakery before selling it to Kraft Inc. in 1984. I/AM Importing will handle ordinary grocery products as well as gourmet food, according to Mr. Lender, who is in Tel Aviv this week trying to negotiate exclusive marketing agreements. &quot;Just as I did with bagels,&quot; he says, &quot;I will bring other foods perceived as ethnic products into the general marketplace.&quot;    THERE IS LITTLE HARMONY between Ms. Ballard and Mr. Lender. Both are seeking financial assistance from the Israeli government and competing for the attention of Israeli food processors and U.S. food brokers and retailers. Mr. Lender's I/AM Importing seems to enjoy more credibility among food stores than does the unknown Betavon brand. &quot;We know Murray well from the bagel business,&quot; says Robert Wunderle, a vice president at Supermarkets General Corp. &quot;We feel he can provide the marketing expertise Israeli producers have lacked.&quot;    So far, the Israeli government isn't taking sides. &quot;We will support any initiative that will lead to broader distribution of Israeli products,&quot; says Trade Commissioner David Litvak. &quot;Many of our food manufacturers have regarded New York's Hudson River as the western boundary of the U.S.&quot; Last year, Israel exported $58 million of food to the U.S., much of which was sold as supermarket private-label brands. Only a handful of Israeli brands, such as Jaffa oranges and Carmel tomatoes, have any consumer awareness here.    While they will increase exports, promoters of the Betavon brand probably won't do much to strengthen Israel's image as a producer of quality food. &quot;Identifying yourself closely with Israel would be the kiss of death,&quot; declares Ms. Ballard, referring to anti-Semitism and mixed feelings in the U.S. about Israeli government policies. &quot;Food brokers told us once we move into the Midwest and the South, we'd have real problems selling products from Israel.&quot;    BETAVON, then, might seem like an odd choice for a brand name since it is a contraction of the Hebrew words for &quot;bon appetit.&quot; But Betavon was chosen over 22 other possible names because focus groups of consumers thought it sounded French. To further minimize the Israeli connection, information about the country of origin is printed in tiny letters on the back panel of the black-and-gold Betavon packages. And Betavon's $2.7 million ad campaign will include a commercial that features a West German rock band and makes no mention of Israel.    I/AM Importing, on the other hand, won't shy away from Israel at all. &quot;We'll promote products under the banner of 'fine foods from Israel,'&quot; Mr. Lender says. &quot;There's nothing to be ashamed of.&quot; In fact, I/AM is portraying Israel as America's best friend in the Middle East as it tries to coax retailers to stock its products.    But that strategy may not win much shelf space. Dave Herriman, vice president of grocery operations at Giant Food Inc., notes that Israeli companies rely too much on ethnic support and political sympathy and not enough on the quality of their products. &quot;If they want to expand their business in the U.S. beyond New York,&quot; he says, &quot;they must get away from the mind-set of appealing to Jews and other people sympathetic to Israel. Emotional ties to Israel simply aren't reason enough to buy the country's products.&quot;    BOTH I/AM IMPORTING and Betavon may very well encounter greater resistance from retailers like Giant Food than from consumers. Some supermarket managers remember all too vividly the poor packaging and inferior quality of many of the Israeli food products they have carried in the past. &quot;One of the biggest challenges is for Israeli companies to understand the level of quality U.S. consumers have come to expect,&quot; says Larry Nussbaum, vice president at Sweet Life Foods, a U.S. wholesaler. &quot;What sells well there won't make it here. Their quality control is haphazard.&quot; U.S. supermarket executives recall having received Israeli cans made of such cheap material that they leaked and even exploded. Giant Food still refuses to carry Israeli tomato and citrus products because of bad memories of them.    Israeli food companies also have been slow to understand the fundamentals of marketing in the U.S. Their strategy was simply to get the product on the store shelf and then let shoppers decide if they'd like to buy it, rather than advertise to spur consumer demand. &quot;Retailers are interested in one thing,&quot; says Betavon's Ms. Ballard. &quot;How much dough will you put into ads and promotion.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
