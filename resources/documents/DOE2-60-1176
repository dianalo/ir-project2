<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-60-1176 </DOCNO><TEXT>The optical bleaching behaviour of the optical absorption bands producedby X-irradiation is investigated by paying particular attention to thedifference between the two types of F centers in the BaFCl crystals.The optical bleachings are performed using a Xe-lamp. The optical absorptionspectra and changes in the absorption bands during bleaching with F(Cl/sup-/) and F(F/sup -/) light are given and discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
