Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from June 5, 1989 through June 16, 1989. The last biweeklynotice was published on June 14, 1989 (54 FR 25367). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By July 28, 1989 the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Carolina Power andamp; Light Company, et al., Docket Nos. 50-325 and50-324, Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, Brunswick County,North Carolina </ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendments: </T3>June 21, 1987, as supplementedMay 19, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>Presently, the Unit 1 TechnicalSpecification 5.6.3 states ``the fuel storage pool is designed and shallbe maintained with a storage capacity limited to no more than 160 PWR fuelassemblies and 1803 BWR fuel assemblies.'' The Unit 2 Technical Specification5.6.3 states ``the fuel storage pool is designed and shall be maintainedwith a storage capacity limited to no more than 144 PWR fuel assembliesand 1839 BWR fuel assemblies.'' The proposed amendment would delete thewords ``a storage capacity limited to'' from Technical Specification 5.6.3.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazard consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazard consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Aproposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The Carolina Power andamp; Light Company (CPandamp;L) has reviewed the proposedchanges to the Technical Specifications and has determined that the requestedamendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration for thefollowing reasons: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluatedbecause the number of assemblies permitted to be stored in each spent fuelpool is not changed. The spent fuel pool criticality, thermal, seismic,and rack material analyses are not affected by the proposed amendment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated becauseno aspect of plant operation will be altered as a result of the change.As stated above, the total number of fuel assemblies allowed in each spentfuel pool remains the same. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reductionin the margin of safety. The Company has reviewed this request and determinedthat it does not affect the criticality analysis, the thermal analysis,the seismic analysis, or the rack material analysis performed for the spentfuel pool. As such, the margin of safety is unaffected. In order to determineif the staff agrees with Carolina Power andamp; Light Company's determination,the staff reviewed its Safety Evaluation of December 15, 1983 in supportof the last reracking of the Brunswick spent fuel pool (Amendment No. 61for Unit 1 and Amendment No. 87 for Unit 2). The introduction to the staff'sSafety Evaluation states, in part, that the licensee proposed 160 PWR and1803 BWR licensed spaces for Unit 1 and 144 PWR and 1839 BWR licensed spacesfor Unit 2. Thus, the staff reviewed, evaluated, and approved the totalnumber of licensed spaces versus the total possible storage capacity whichin the Brunswick case, at the present time, is different. </ITAG>Unit 1 now has one less 6x6 BWR rack than originally anticipated to beinstalled. Therefore, the storage capacity is not the same as the totalpermitted assemblies that could be put in storage. The rack may or maynot be installed according to the licensee. Unit 2 now has two less 6x6 BWR racks than originally anticipated to beinstalled. In addition, it has one extra 4x4 PWR rack installed. Althoughthe installed capacity for the PWR racks is 160 PWR assemblies, the licenseeis administratively holding the actual storage of PWR assemblies to the144 TS value. The two BWR racks may or may not be installed according tothe licensee. The one extra PWR rack may or may not be removed accordingto the licensee. The staff has reviewed the CPandamp;L determination of no significant hazardsconsideration and is in basic agreement with them as long as the licenseerestricts the total number of assemblies placed in storage in each poolper the TS limits, as authorized by the above specified amendments. Accordingly,the Commission proposes to determine that the requested amendment doesnot involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>University of North Carolinaat Wilmington, William Madison Randall Library, 601 S.

According to 10 CFR 50.92(c),a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence ofan accident previously evaluated; or 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated; or 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed amendment makes several changes to the Technical Specifications.These changes are the (1) auxiliary building ventilation (VA) flowrates,(2) correction of a typographical error, (3) the deletion of the word ``cold''when describing the dioctyl phthalate (DOP) used for VA system testing,(4) the changes in the control room ventilation (VC) flowrates for ByronStation, (5) the deletion of a footnote that is no longer applicable, and(6) the change in heater dissipation rate. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The VA non-accessiblearea ventilation system will be operated as described in the design andintent of the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The VA non-accessiblearea ventilation system bases is to ensure that radioactive materials,leaking from the ECCS equipment within non-accessible pump rooms followinga LOCA, are filtered prior to reaching the environment. Though UFSAR changeswill be required to reflect the proposed flowrates, the bases remain satisfied.The VC proposed flowrate change ensures that a pressure of greater thanor equal to 1/8 inch water gauge relative to ambient pressure in areasadjacent to the control room, and .02 inch water gauge relative to theUpper Cable Spreading Room and adjacent areas (except the control room)are maintained. This is consistent with the design and intent of the UFSAR;however, the proposed flowrates will need to be reflected in the UFSAR.The bases for the VC System are satisfied such that the allowable temperatureswill be maintained in the control room and the control room will be maintainedhabitable for operations personnel during and following all credible accidentconditions. Deletion of the word ``cold'' from the description of DOP usedin testing has no effect on the VA System operation per UFSAR design and/oranalysis and has no significant consequences. The change removes an overlyconservative restriction and revises Technical Specifications to allowtesting consistent with ANSI N510-1980. The typographical correction doesnot affect any accident. The deletion of the footnote has no effect onany accident since the footnote is no longer applicable. The control Room Emergency Make-Up Air Filter Unit heaters were designedto comply with ANSI N-509 and Regulatory Guide 1.52-1976 requirements oflimiting the relative humidity (RH) entering the carbon absorbers to 70%RH at the design flowrate. The heater performance was evaluated consideringa main steam line break (MSLB) accident and a loss of coolant accident(LOCA). The heaters are not required for the MSLB accident since only afraction of a percent of iodine removal efficiency for the carbon absorbersis needed to reduce the postulated Control Room thyroid dose below 10 CFRPart 50, Appendix A, GDC-19 limits. For the LOCA, air conditions were assumedto conservatively reflect atmospheric conditions. It was determined thatthe relative humidity can be limited to approximately 70% with a heatercapacity of 21.1 kW. The proposed Technical Specification change is consistentwith this determination; therefore, the probability and consequences ofan accident remain unaffected. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any previously analyzed. The new VA flowrates area result of the Testing Adjusting and Balancing (TAB) of the VA Systemand achieved acceptable system performance characteristics per system designas outlined in the UFSAR though the UFSAR flowrates need to be changed.All cooling requirements, as well as pressure requirements, are maintainedper the design and intent of the UFSAR as described in the bases for theVA non-accessible area system which is to ensure the system operabilitysuch that radioactive materials leaking from the ECCS equipment withinthe pump rooms following a LOCA are filtered prior to reaching the environment.The VC flowrates are changed due to a need for an increased range afteractual air densities were considered for instrument drift. The changedairflow meets the requirement to maintain greater than or equal to +.125inch Water Gauge (inwg) in the control room and .02 inwg between the uppercable spreading room and adjacent area (except the control room). The basesfor the VC System remain satisfied as the allowable temperatures will bemaintained in the control room, and the control room will be maintainedhabitable for operations personnel during and following all credible accidentconditions. The deletion of the word ``cold'' from the DOP descriptionhas no effect on system operation per UFSAR design and/or analysis andthus has no effect on the significant hazards considerations. The typographicalcorrection has no effect on any accident. The deletion of the footnote,which is no longer applicable, has no effect on the creation of any accident.The change to required heater capacity is based upon analysis which establishesa minimum heater capacity that envelopes the accident analysis results.Since no new equipment is being added or control changes being performed,the possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created.The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the marginof safety. The VA System flowrates as a result of the TAB will still maintainall ECCS pump room pressures as required. The bases for Technical Specification3/4.7.7 will be met as the system has been balanced, such that the airflowsprovide negative pressures in the Auxiliary Building and Fuel HandlingBuilding and ensure that ALARA and EQ parameters are maintained in accordancewith the UFSAR. This ensures that all radioactive materials leaking fromECCS equipment in the pump rooms following a LOCA are filtered prior toreaching the environment. Thus the VA flowrates will be revised in accordancewith Byron and Braidwood specific system performance characteristics andanalysis. The VC system flowrate change still ensures that control roompressure remains within the boundary for control room habitability perTechnical Specification 3/4.7.6 bases. This provides for the bases beingsatisfied in that the allowable temperatures in the control room will bemaintained and the control room will remain habitable for operations personnelduring and following all accident conditions. The deletion of the word``cold'' from the DOP description changes has no effect on the margin ofsafety for Technical Specification 3/4.7.7 and 3/4.9.12 as described intheir bases. The typographical correction has no effect on the margin of safety. Thedeletion of the footnote, which is no longer applicable, has no effecton the margin of safety. The Technical Specification Bases state that operationof the system with the heaters operating for at least 10 continuous hoursin a 31-day period is sufficient to reduce the buildup of moisture on theabsorbers and HEPA filters. The proposed change limits the relative humidityentering the absorbers to 70% in accordance with ANSI N-509 and RegulatoryGuide 1.52-1976 design requirements. Therefore, the margin of safety isnot affected. Therefore, based upon the above analysis, the staff concludes that theproposed amendment to the Technical Specification does not involve a significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>For Rockford Public Library,215 N.

According to 10 CFR 50.92(c),a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence ofan accident previously evaluated; or 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated; or 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change does not result in any increase in the probabilityor consequences of accidents previously evaluated. The probability foran accident is independent of the absorber material used in the Rod ControlCluster Assembly (RCCA). The consequences remain unchanged because thesilver-indium-cadmium absorber material meets the mechanical, physical,nuclear, and thermal properties assumed in the accident analysis. The proposed change does not create the possibility for a new or differentkind of accident from those previously evaluated. The physical characteristicsof the silver-indium-cadmium RCCA's are comparable to that of the hafniumRCCA's. The physical size and construction of the RCCA's are the same.Both absorbers exhibit similar neutron absorption characteristics, henceflux distribution and shutdown margins will remain within limits. The weights of the two differing RCCA's are comparable. Rod drop timeswill remain well within the values assumed in the FSAR. Both absorber materialsare compatible with reactor coolant and reactor materials. The proposed change does not involve a reduction in the margin of safety.All safety limits and limiting conditions for operation will continue tobe met. The use of silver-indium-cadmium RCCA's is consistent with allassumptions made in the accident analysis. Silver-indium-cadmium is currentlyin use at several Westinghouse plants. This absorber material has beenshown through experience to be an effective and stable material. Based on the preceding assessment, the staff believes these proposed amendmentsinvolve no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>For Byron Station, the RockfordPublic Library, 215 N.

In addition to the proposed changes tothe General Surveillance Requirements, changes are also proposed to Section3.3.1.F, Reactor Coolant System, Operational Components-Relief Valves,and Section 3.9.3.A, Containment Isolation-Containment Isolation Valves.These later changes reflect the new guidance of the proposed General SurveillanceRequirements and/or an upgrade to the requirements of Standardized TechnicalSpecifications (STS). The proposed changes are expected to be consistentwith the guidance contained in Generic Letter 87-09 dated June 4, 1987which was issued to address several problems that were related to the GeneralLimiting Conditions of Operations (LCO) of the STS. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The staff has evaluated this proposed amendment and determined thatit involves no significant hazards consideration. According to 10 CFR 50.92(c),a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequence of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The Commonwealth Edison Company (the licensee) provided the following discussionregarding the evaluation of the significant hazards consideration. CommonwealthEdison has evaluated this proposed amendment and determined that it involvesno significant hazards consideration. According to 10 CFR 50.92(c), a proposedamendment to an operating license involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes involve Technical Specifications 3.0.4, 4.0.3 and4.0.4, plus those Technical Specifications that are affected by these sections.These changes are being made and requested in accordance with NRC GenericLetter 87-09 issued on June 4, 1987. Changes to Technical Specification, Appendix A, pages 27a, 27b and 27cthrough 27f, in this proposed amendment involve Specifications 4.0.3 and4.0.4 and the corresponding Bases sections. Some Action requirements haveallowable outage time limits that do not allow sufficient time for thecompletion of a missed surveillance before the Action requirements wouldnecessitate a plant shutdown. If a plant shutdown is required before amissed surveillance is completed, it is likely that the surveillance wouldbe conducted during the shutdown in an effort to terminate the shutdownrequirements. This circumstance is undesirable for two reasons: (1) increased pressure on plant staff to complete the surveillance couldlead to errors that may result in plant upset, and (2) the plant would be in a transient state involving potential upsetsto the plant that could require a demand for the system when the systemis removed from service for testing. The proposed changes will also help clarify the potential conflicts betweenSpecifications 4.0.3 and 4.0.4. The first conflict could arise when a plantshutdown is required as a consequence of an Action requirement. This willrequire a surveillance to performed, to become due prior to entry intoa lower mode. This could result in delays in reaching lower modes as aresult of a Technical Specification Action requirement. The second conflict could arise when Surveillance Requirements can onlybe completed after entry into a mode or specified condition for which theSurveillance Requirements apply, and an exception to the requirements ofSpecification 4.0.4 is allowed. However, upon entry into this mode or condition,the requirements of Specification 4.0.3 may not be met because the SurveillanceRequirements may not have been performed within the allowed surveillanceinterval. Allowing for a delay in the applicability of Action Requirementsfor Specification 4.0.3 will provide an appropriate time limit for thecompletion of Surveillance Requirements that are allowed as an exceptionto Specification 4.0.4. The proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. In regards to the changes to the GeneralLCO's, the Surveillance Requirements are defined in 10 CFR 50.36 as thoserequirements that assure the necessary quality of systems and componentsare maintained such that safety limits are maintained and Limiting Conditionsfor Operation are met under these changes. The appropriate surveillanceswill still be performed. The proposed changes will only allow flexibilityin performing these Surveillance Requirements prior to a plant shutdownbeing necessitated in the case of a surveillance being inadvertently missed.The proposed change to be page 77, which excludes Specification 3.3.1.Ffrom General LCO 3.0.4, does not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated since thischange will make Zion's Technical Specification the same as NRC approvedStandard Technical Specification which allows this exemption. The proposed changes to pages 199a and 199b, revise Specification 3.9.3.Ato be the same as Commonwealth Edison's Byron and Braidwood Station Specifications.This change will not cause a significant increase in the probability orconsequences of an accident previously evaluated since it requires theaffected penetration and associated system to be declared inoperable within4 hours and appropriate action to be taken. This change meets example (iv)of 48 FR 14869 i.e., a relief granted upon demonstration of acceptableoperation from an operating restriction that was imposed because acceptableoperation was not yet demonstrated. This assumes that the operating restrictionand the criteria to be applied to a request for relief have been establishedin a <T3>prior review </T3>and that it is justified in a satisfactory way thatthe criteria has been met. None of the proposed changes create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. No new equipmentis being introduced as a result of the changes. These changes do not resultin equipment being introduced as a result of changes. These changes donot result in equipment being operated in a manner different from presentrequirements. No change is being made which alters the function of anyplant equipment. None of the proposed changes involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. In regards to the changes related to Sections 4.0.3 and 4.0.4(i.e. allowing an appropriate time period for performance of a missed surveillance),a surveillance required by entry into an Action statement or performanceof one precluded by plant conditions would in effect reduce the possibilityfor a potential plant upset. The proposed changes to Section 3.3.1.F and 3.9.3, also do not involvea significant reduction in a margin of safety since corrective action willbe taken within a specified time limit to ensure that the release of radioactivematerial to the environment will be consistent with the assumptions usedin the analyses of a LOCA. Therefore, based on the above evaluation, Commonwealth Edison believesthat these changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration.Since the application for amendment satisfies the criteria specified in10 CFR 50.92 and is similar to an example for which no significant hazardsconsideration exists, Commonwealth Edison Company has made a determinationthat the application involves no significant hazards consideration determinationand agrees with the licensee's analysis. Accordingly, the Commission proposed to determine that the proposed changesto the Technical Specifications involve no significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Waukegan Public Library,128 N.

A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee provided the following analysis of the proposed changes: <ITAG tagnum="21">In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.92, the proposedchanges to Technical Specification 3.3.A.1.k, Technical Specification 3.3.B.1.aand Technical Specification Basis 3.3 are deemed not to involve any SignificantHazards Consideration because operation of Indian Point Unit No. 2 in accordancewith this change would not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> As part of a previously proposed Technical Specification amendment(submitted June 12, 1987), we enclosed a revision to FSAR Section 14.3.5,entitled ``Containment Integrity Analysis'' (this revision is part of theforthcoming FSAR update). The Containment Pressure versus Time curves presentedin this analysis assumed only one operating Containment Spray Pump, threeoperating Containment Fan Coolers and took no credit for RecirculationSpray. This analysis was approved by the NRC and an SER issued on June29, 1988 with Technical Specification Amendment 132. The analysis assumedthat the RWST was completely drained (340,000 gallons injected) prior toswitchover to the Recirculation Phase for the RHR and SI pumps, thus minimizingthe contribution of Containment Spray to the containment integrity analysis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In actuality, operators would begin to initiate the changeover tothe Recirculation Phase soon after 246,000 gallons from the RWST had beeninjected into the containment. Therefore, much more RWST water is availablefor Containment Spray than necessary for pressure suppression of the containmentfor the limiting design basis accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since the above shows that 80,000 gallons is not needed to be reservedin the RWST for the Recirculation Phase, the proposed change would reserve60,000 gallons for the Recirculation Phase. As shown in the proposed TechnicalSpecification 3.3 Basis, the remaining 60,000 gallons would be utilizedto provide additional leeway in the alarm setpoints and to provide additionalmargin in which to perform the injection to recirculation switchover. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The rational for not completely draining the RWST prior to initiatingthe Recirculation Phase is twofold: </ITAG>a) To assure that the SI and RHR pumps will not be damaged due to insufficientwater supply prior to switchover, and <ITAG tagnum="21">b) To assure that an adequate amount of NaOH is provided to the containmentvia the Containment Spray System pathway during the Injection (246,000gallons) and the Recirculation (60,000 gallons) Phases. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With respect to Item a, sufficient water is preserved in the RWSTto preclude pump damage. With respect to Item b, [it has been determined]that an increase from 30% to 33% in the NaOH concentration in the SprayAdditive Tank will compensate for the 20,000 gallon decrease in the RWSTwater reserved for the Containment Spray pumps to add NaOH into containmentfrom the Spray Additive Tank after switchover. Thus the pH post-LOCA willbe the same as the current FSAR analyses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes (i.e., the RWST alarm setpoints and the NaOHconcentration) deal only with accident mitigation and do not provide anysort of automatic initiation. Thus, there are no credible equipment failuresassociated with these proposed changes that would initiate an accident.In addition, since these proposed changes are associated with equipmentlocated outside containment, there are no credible failures attributableto these proposed changes that could directly affect the Reactor CoolantSystem. Thus, these proposed changes would not significantly increase theprobability of an accident previously evaluated nor would they significantlyincrease in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, these proposed changes do not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.

Finally, these proposed changes do not modify the physical configurationof the plant. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As discussed in Item 1 above, these changes are based on an approvedrevision to FSAR Section 14.3.5. This discussion shows that 80,000 gallonsis not needed to be reserved in the RWST for the Recirculation Phase, theproposed change would reserve 60,000 gallons for the Recirculation Phase.As shown in the proposed Technical Specification 3.3 Basis, the remaining60,000 gallons would be utilized to provide additional leeway in the alarmsetpoints and to provide additional margin in which to perform the injectionto recirculation switchover. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The rationale for not completely draining the RWST prior to initiatingthe Recirculation Phase is twofold: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a) To assure that the SI and RHR pumps will not be damaged due toinsufficient water supply prior to switchover, and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b) To assure that an adequate amount of NaOH is provided to the containmentvia the Containment Spray System pathway during the Injection (246,000gallons) and the Recirculation (60,000 gallons) Phases. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With respect to Item a, sufficient water is preserved in the RWSTto preclude pump damage. With respect to Item b, it has been determinedthat an increase from 30% to 33% in the NaOH concentration in the SprayAdditive Tank will compensate for the decrease 20,000 in the RWST waterreserved for the Containment Spray pumps to add NaOH into containment fromthe Spray Additive Tank after switchover. Consequently, the post-LOCA pHwill be the same as the current FSAR analyses. Thus, it has been demonstratedthat the margin of safety is essentially unaffected. Therefore, the proposedchanges do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, based on the above discussion the licensee has determinedthat the proposed changes to Technical Specification 3.3.A.1.k, TechnicalSpecification 3.3.B.1.a and Technical Specification Basis 3.3 do not involveany Significant Hazards Consideration. </ITAG>The staff agrees with the licensee's analysis.

Currently,the St. Lucie Unit 1 TS do not include provisions for repair using sleeveswith mechanical joints for those steam generator tubes with eddy currentindications showing greater than 40% through-wall degradation. The currentSt. Lucie Unit 1 TS language was established before the sleeving repairmethod using mechanical joints to maintain the tubes in service was developed.The proposed TS changes would specify the requirements for repairing degradedor defective tubes using sleeves with mechanical joints in the St. LucieUnit 1 steam generators. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee provided the following discussion regarding the above threecriteria. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Criterion 1</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The repair of degraded steam generator tubes using sleeves will resultin tube bundle integrity consistent with the original design basis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The sleeve configuration has been designed and analyzed in accordancewith the rules of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boilerand Pressure Vessel Code. Fatigue and stress analyses of the sleeved tubeassemblies produced acceptable results. Mechanical testing has shown thatthe structural strength of the sleeves under normal, faulted and upsetconditions is within acceptable limits. Leak rate testing has demonstratedthat the leak rates of the joints between the sleeve and the existing tubeunder normal, faulted and upset conditions are well below acceptable rates.The existing Technical Specification leakage rate requirements and accidentanalysis assumptions remain unchanged in the event significant leakagefrom the sleeve would occur. Any leakage through the sleeved region ofthe tube due to potential localized tube degradation is fully bounded byleak-before-break considerations and ultimately by the existing steam generatortube rupture analysis included in the St. Lucie Unit 1 Updated Final SafetyAnalysis Report. The proposed Technical Specification change to supportthe installation of mechanical joint sleeves does not adversely impactany other previously evaluated design basis accident or the results ofLoss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) and non-LOCA analyses. The results of thequalification testing, analyses, and plant operating experience demonstratethat the sleeve assembly is an acceptable means of maintaining tubes inservice. Furthermore, per U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission RegulatoryGuide 1.83 recommendations, the sleeved tube can be monitored through periodicinspections with present eddy current techniques. Plugging limit criteriaare established in the Technical Specifications for the tube in the regionof the sleeve and the sleeve. These measures demonstrate that installationof sleeves which span degraded areas of the tube will restore the tubeto its original design basis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The sleeve dimensions and joints were designed to the applicable ASMEBoiler and Pressure Vessel Code. An extensive analysis and test programwas undertaken to prove the adequacy of the welded sleeve. This programdetermined the effect of normal operating and postulated accident conditionson the sleeve-tube assembly, as well as the adequacy of the assembly toperform its intended function. Design criteria were established prior toperforming the analysis and test program which, if met, would prove thatthe welded sleeve is an acceptable repair technique. Based upon the resultsof the analytical and test programs, the welded sleeve fulfills its intendedfunction as a leak tight structural member and meets or exceeds all thedesign and operating criteria. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Criterion 2</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Implementation of the proposed tube degradation repair method doesnot introduce significant changes to the plant design bases. Repair oftubes does not provide a mechanism to result in an accident outside ofthe sleeved area. Any hypothetical accident as a result of potential tubeor sleeve degradation in the repaired portion of the tube would be boundedby the existing tube rupture accident analysis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The installation of welded tube sleeves does not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. Theinstallation of welded tube sleeves will be performed in a manner [consistent]with the applicable standards, will preserve the existing design bases,and will not adversely impact the qualification of any plant systems. Thiswill preclude adverse control/protection systems interactions. The design,installation and inspection of the welded sleeve will be done in accordancewith ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code criteria. By adherence to industrystandards, the pressure boundary integrity will be preserved. As such,the possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Criterion 3</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The effect of sleeving on the design transients and accident safetyanalysis has been reviewed based on the installation of the maximum numberof sleeves expected. The installation of sleeves can be evaluated as theequivalent of some level of steam generator tube plugging. The St. LucieUnit 1 steam generators are currently licensed to 15 percent steam generatortube plugging (SGTP). Evaluation of the installation of sleeves is basedon assuming that LOCA evaluations for 15 percent tube plugging bound theeffect of a combination of tube plugging and sleeving up to an equivalentof 15 percent SGTP. For the purpose of assessing the impact on the non-LOCAsafety analyses and the design transients, it is assumed that the reactorcoolant flow rate used for these analyses and transients is less than thatwhich results from 15 percent equivalent SGTP. Given that the reactor coolantflow rate up to 15 percent equivalent SGTP is greater than the flow rateused for these analyses, the non-LOCA safety analyses and design transientsare not adversely impacted by steam generator sleeving. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The safety margins in the analyses of postulated accident conditionsand design transients are provided in the assumptions and conservatismin the calculations and computer codes used and in the requirements andrecommendations of the NRC. Accordingly, based on the information outlinedabove, there is no decrease in the safety margins defined in the basisof the plant Technical Specifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Implementation of tube repair by sleeving will decrease the numberof tubes which must be taken out of service with tube plugs. Installationof tube plugs reduces the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) flow margin, thusimplementation of tube repair by sleeving will maintain the margin of flowthat would otherwise be reduced in the event of increased plugging. Basedon the above, it is concluded that the proposed change does not resultin a significant reduction in a loss of margin with respect to plant safetyas defined in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report or the basis forthe St. Lucie Unit 1 Technical Specifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The installation of a sleeve in a steam generator tube increases theflow resistance through the tube. The increased resistance may result inreduced flow through the sleeved tube. To determine the effect of installingwelded sleeves in the steam generators, an analysis was performed. A conservativesleeve length was used in evaluating the effects of the sleeves on theheat transfer and hydraulic capabilities of the steam generators. Usingthe head and flow characteristics of each of the four primary pumps inconjunction with the primary system hydraulic resistances, the flow ratewas calculated as a function of the number of sleeved tubes. The TechnicalSpecification minimum allowable flow rate was used to determine the maximumnumber of tubes per steam generator which can be sleeved at both hot andcold legs. The change in primary system flow rate based on the maximumnumber of tubes which can be sleeved per steam generator was calculatedto be 2.6 percent. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The effect of the change in flow rate on heat transfer between theprimary and secondary side of the steam generator was determined to benegligible. The overall resistance to heat transfer between the primaryand secondary sides consists of the primary side film resistance, the resistanceto heat transfer through tube wall, and the secondary side film resistance.Since the primary side film resistance is only a small portion of the totalresistance, the effect of the calculated maximum change on flow rate onheat transfer is negligible. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The loss in heat transfer area associated with sleeving was also determinedto be small. When the sleeve is installed on the steam generator tube,there is an annulus between the sleeve and the tube except in the sleevetube weld regions. Hence, there is effectively little primary to secondaryheat transfer in the region where the sleeve is installed. However, sincenegligible heat is transferred in the tubesheet region anyway, the lossin heat transfer area associated with sleeving is also negligible. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Based on the above, [the Florida Power andamp; Light Company has] determinedthat the amendment request does not (1) involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated,(2) create the probability of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety; and therefore does not involve a significant hazardsconsideration. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

In addition, the COLR wouldbe included in the Definitions Section of the Technical Specifications(TS) to note that it is the unit-specific document that provides theselimits for the current operating reload cycle. Furthermore, the definitionwould note that the values of these cycle-specific parameter limits areto be determined in accordance with Specification 6.9.1.6. This Specificationwould require that the Core Operating Limits be determined for each reloadcycle in accordance with the referenced NRC-approved methodology for theselimits and consistent with the applicable limits of the safety analysis.Finally, this report and any mid-cycle revisions would be provided to theNRC upon issuance. Generic Letter 88-16, dated October 4, 1988, from theNRC provided guidance to licensees on requests for removal of the valuesof cycle-specific parameter limits from TS. The licensee's proposed amendmentis in response to this Generic Letter. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The staff has evaluated this proposed amendment and determined thatit involves no significant hazards considerations. According to 10 CFR50.92(c), a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significanthazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance withthe proposed amendment would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated; or 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated; or 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed revision is in accordance with the guidance provided in GenericLetter 88-16 for licensees requesting removal of the values of cycle-specificparameter limits from TS. The establishment of these limits in accordancewith an NRC-approved methodology and the incorporation of these limitsinto the COLR will ensure that proper steps have been taken to establishthe values of these limits. Furthermore, the submittal of the COLR willallow the staff to continue to trend the values of these limits withoutthe the need for prior staff approval of these limits and without introductionof an unreviewed safety question. The revised specifications with the removalof the values of cycle-specific parameter limits and the addition of thereferenced report for these limits does not create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident for those previously evaluated. Theyalso do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety sincethe change does not alter the methods used to establish these limits. Consequently, the proposed change on the removal of the values of cycle-specificlimits do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequenceof a previously evaluated accident. Because the values of cycle-specific parameter limits will continue tobe determined in accordance with an NRC-approved methodology and consistentwith the applicable limits of the safety analysis, these changes are administrativein nature and do not impact the operation of the facility in a manner thatinvolves significant hazards consideration. The proposed amendment does not alter the requirement that the plant beoperated within the limits for cycle-specific parameters nor the requiredremedial actions that must be taken when these limits are not met. Whileit is recognized that such requirements are essential to plant safety,the values of limits can be determined in accordance with NRC-approvedmethods without affecting nuclear safety. With the removal of the valuesof these limits from the Technical Specifications, they have been incorporatedinto the COLR which is submitted to the Commission. Hence, appropriatemeasures exist to control the values of these limits. These changes areadministrative in nature and do not impact the operation of the facilityin a manner that involves significant hazards considerations. Based on the preceding assessment, the staff believes this proposed amendmentinvolves no significant hazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Rooms Location: </T3>Wharton County Junior College,J.

It was determined that since therod worth behavior is similar between a Ag-In-Cd and Hf RCCA, the corepower distributions under rated conditions are essentially the same. Based on neutronic calculations comparing Hf to Ag-In-Cd and to combinationsof both types of RCCA during steady state operation and under accidentconditions, it was concluded that the largest change in total rod worthresulting from the substitution of absorber materials was 100 pcm. Thecorresponding change in N-1 rod worth was limited to 50 pcm, and the largestincrease in peaking factors would be 1%. This slight increase in the peakingfactors is based on RCCA banks being Hf or Ag-In-Cd but not a mixture ofthe materials within any one bank. With respect to mechanical effects, the overall RCCA design and the physicalgeometry remains the same for Hf or Ag-In-Cd. In addition, the total RCCA/driverod assembly weight is 31 lbs. less for Ag-In-Cd. With respect to thisdifference in weight, the drop time limits corresponding to either Hf orAg-In-Cd design remain within the Technical Specification limit of 2.8seconds. Generic mechanical response calculations were performed to confirmthat the rod drop time of the Ag-In-Cd RCCAs will not exceed that currentlyassumed for Hf RCCAs. The licensee considered the following accidents or accident related situations;Large Break LOCA, Small Break LOCA, Hot Leg Switchover to Prevent PotentialBoron Precipitation, Reactor Vessel and LOOP Blowdown Forcing Functions,Post-LOCA Long-Term Cooling Subcriticality Requirement, Rod Ejection LargeTerm Mass and Energy Release, and Containment Integrity. In each instancethere was no change to previous analyses, because either no credit wastaken for the RCCAs in the analysis, or the most severe conditions assumedfor the accident occurred after all rods were fully inserted. In addition, the licensee considered the following parameters as they wouldaffect the non-LOCA safety analysis, in particular, trip reactivity, nomalizedtrip reactivity vs. axial position, shutdown margin, ejected rod worths,other rod worth parameters possibly affected by an RCCA change, and roddrop time. It was concluded that the values for the first five parametersnoted above will remain within the values assumed in the non-LOCA safetyanalyses. Mechanical response calculations showed that the rod drop timeof the Ag-In-Cd RCCAs will not exceed that currently assumed for Hf RCCAs.The values used in the non-LOCA safety analysis and Technical Specificationswill remain bounding. The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of thestandards for determining whether a significant hazards consideration existsby providing certain examples (51 FR 7751). An example of an amendmentwhich involves a no significant hazards consideration is example (vi) achange which either may result in some increase to the probability or consequencesof a previously-analyzed accident or may reduce in some way a safety margin,but where the results of the change are clearly within all acceptable criteriawith respect to the system or component specified in the Standard ReviewPlan: for example, a change resulting from the application of a small refinementof a previously used calculational model or design method. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination. Based on the review and the above discussions, the staffproposes to determine that the proposed changes do not involve a significanthazards consideration. Further the staff concludes that the proposed changeis essentially a direct substitution of RCCA materials and is consideredwithin example (vi). <T3>Local Public Document Rooms Location: </T3>Wharton County Junior College,J.

The revision of this LCO will minimize operatorconfusion by specifying the minimum emergency core cooling system operabilityrequirements during periods when operations are being performed which havethe potential for draining the reactor vessel. Additional restrictionsin the Technical Specifications are proposed (Specification 3.5.G.4(d)and 3.5.G.5) which would prohibit operations which have the potential fordraining the reactor vessel when the suppression pool water supply is unavailable.Administrative changes are also requested. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards (10 CFR 50.92(c)) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has provided the following analysis in support of a no-significant-hazards-considerationdetermination: <ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.The licensee has elected to adopt a more defined Limiting Condition forOperation (LCO) than is presently included in the Technical Specifications.It will apply when work is being performed which has the potential fordraining the reactor vessel. The revised LCO defines the core cooling capabilitythat must be available when such work is being performed. The licenseehas previously performed a conservative evaluation of a water loss eventwhile maintenance is performed on control rod drives (CRDs). The postulatedworst case loss of reactor vessel inventory would be caused by failureof the velocity-limiter section of a control rod which would allow coolantto drain from the vessel through the CRD housing. The maximum leakage flowrate is 1328 gpm which is something less than one-half of the makeup capabilityof either one core spray pump (3020 gpm) or one Low Pressure Coolant Injection(LPCI) pump (4800 gpm). In addition, the revised LCO requires an independentonsite power source (at least one emergency diesel generator) which providesbackup power to the core spray and residual heat removal (LPCI) pumps.</ITAG>An additional restriction (new Specification 3.5.G.4(d)) must be met beforecore alterations can proceed if the suppression pool volume is below specifiedminimum values. The restriction has no effect on the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. <ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident. The revised LCO is a procedural limitationwhich will ensure that adequate core cooling systems are available in theevent of a postulated loss of reactor vessel coolant inventory. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">During core alterations, with the suppression pool below the requiredminimum value and the reactor cavity flooded, prohibiting operations whichhave the potential for draining the vessel ensures that a new or differenttype of accident than previously evaluated will not be created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The LCO ensures that adequate core cooling capabilityand an independent power source are available if needed. The proposed amendmentwill not reduce safety margins; in fact, the rewording of an ambiguousstatement (Specification 3.5.G.3) will help avoid the possibility of operatorconfusion, thereby indirectly increasing the margin of safety. </ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's proposed no significant hazardsdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

The Plan requires that the IowaElectric Light and Power Company (IELP/the licensee) follow the scheduleof the DAEC plant modifications mandated or proposed by NRC, or identifiedby the licensee. The proposed amendment does not involve changes to plantsystems, components, or Technical Specifications. The Integrated Plan was originally approved in Amendment No. 91, datedMay 3, 1983, and extended by Amendment No. 125, dated July 9, 1985 andAmendment No. 148, dated November 25, 1987. The objective of the IntegratedPlan is to integrate all planned DAEC plant modifications over a periodof 5 years to assure that individual tasks are scheduled and performedin an efficient and cost/resource-effective manner. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists, as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The extension of the DAEC Integrated Plan beyond its current expirationdate of May 3, 1989, is intended to assure continuation of reliable andefficient planning of plant modifications to enhance plant safety. In addition,the extension is purely administrative in nature and has no effect on existingplant systems or equipment. Therefore, the Plan may reduce, but not increase,the probability or the consequences of an accident previously evaluated,will not create a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated, and will not involve any reduction in a margin of safety. In the March 6, 1986 <T4>Federal Register </T4>the NRC published examples of amendments thatare not likely to involve a significant hazards concern (51 FR 7751). Examplenumber (i) of that list is a purely administrative change to the TechnicalSpecifications. The incorporation of a license condition requiring continueduse of a plan to provide for scheduling modifications and notificationof scheduling changes is purely administrative. Based on the above, the Commission's staff has made a proposed determinationthat the proposed amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Cedar Rapids Public Library,500 First Street, S.E., Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52401. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Jack Newman, Esquire, Kathleen H.

Does the proposed change involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Evaluation</T3>: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change involves removal of the minimum stroke time requirementfor the Recirculation Discharge Valves that are required to fully closefollowing a Design Basis Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA). Removal of theminimum valve stroke time requirement will not affect the probability ofoccurrence of a LOCA. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The LOCA analysis that assures compliance with 10 CFR 50.46 does notrely on the minimum valve closure time as an input. Rather, the maximumvalve closure time is used as a key parameter in the analysis. The maximumvalve closure time is unaffected by this proposed change. The minimum valveclosure time was originally incorporated into Technical Specificationsto ensure that the valves would stroke slow enough and hence would notexceed their maximum design differential pressure following a LOCA. Ifthe differential pressure is exceeded, the valve may fail to fully close,thus invalidating the LOCA analysis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Analysis shows that even with significantly faster valve stroke times,the valves will not be subject to a greater than design differential pressuredue to the expected reactor pressure decay rate following a LOCA alongwith the setpoints specified in Technical Specification for the pressurepermissive relays that actuate valve closure. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The LOCA analysis also takes credit for core heat removal that takesplace during recirculation flow coastdown in the unbroken loop the firstfew seconds following a LOCA. The proposed change will not invalidate thisassumption due to the expected reactor pressure decay rate and the pressurepermissive setpoint. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because the proposed change will not affect recirculation dischargevalve closure or recirculation flow coastdown, there is no significantincrease in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The CNS LOCA Analysis does not rely on the minimum stroke time asan input. The two concerns identified with respect to fast closure of theRecirculation Discharge Valves (i.e., failure to close due to high differentialpressure, and impact of fast closure on Recirculation Pump coastdown) areobviated by the CNS LOCA characteristics and the CNS Recirculation DischargeValve pressure permissive control logic. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2.

This change affects refueling activities only. Thecurrent Technical Specification specifies the minimum count rate as a functionof the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio below a count rate of 3 counts per second(cps) for startup purposes. This relationship between count rate and theS/N ratio is defined by Figure 3.3.1. The licensee proposes, in its December28, 1988 application, to extend the applicability of this count rate toS/N relationship to core alteration (refueling) activities. The specificationis also revised such that when the reduced count rate is being utilizedduring refueling activities, at least two of the SRM channels must indicateon or above the curve provided in Figure 3.3.1. Several administrativechanges are also proposed to correct the title of a management positionand to revise the Bases to establish consistency with the TS. The SRM system consists of four identical neutron detection channels thatprovide neutron flux information over a range sufficient to observe thecore shutdown source level, the approach to criticality and the overlapwith the intermediate range monitoring (IRM) system. The SRM system isnot required to ensure that the safety design bases are maintained, and,accordingly, no credit is taken for action by the system in the Final SafetyAnalysis Report (FSAR) accident analyses. The only events related to theproposed change are those that potentially could occur during refueling;a continuous rod withdrawal, which is an anticipated operational transient,and a fuel assembly insertion error. No credit is taken for the SRM's ineither of these analyses. An input assumption for several of the FSAR analysesis that they are initiated from power levels of at least ten-to-the-minus-eightof rated power. As indicated in the licensee's application, the proposedchange in the minimum SRM count rate (the SRM downscale setpoint) willcontinue to ensure that the applicable events would also be initiated fromat least ten-to-the-minus-eight of the rated power level. Therefore, theinput to these analyses remains valid. The proposed change is needed because Unit 3 has been shut down since March1987 and it appears likely that the SRM count rate may not be above theminimum value of three cps on at least two channels when the unit is expectedto be refueled. Therefore, the count rate specification is proposed tobe revised to include values down to 0.7 cps with an associated S/N ratio.The augmentation of the count rate below three cps with an S/N specificationensures that the statistical neutron monitoring confidence level of 95%is maintained at the lower count rates. Unit 2 is proposed to be revisedto provide consistency with Unit 3 TS. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licenseehas provided a discussion of the proposed changes as they relate to thesestandards; the discussion is presented below: <ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 1 - The proposed changes do not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These changes reduce the minimum SRM count rate required to permitcore alterations. The revised count rate is still within the design rangeof the SRM and specifying a minimum signal-to-noise ratio assures the SRMsare responding to thermal neutron flux. No hardware changes are requiredto the SRM system; therefore, malfunction of an SRM will still producethe required rod withdrawal blocks. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The only applicable accidents related to the proposed change are thoseinvolving SRMs during refueling: control rod removal error during refuelingand fuel assembly insertion error during refueling. However, no creditis taken for the SRMs in either of these accident analyses. Further discussionof these accidents is provided below. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Control Rod Removal Error During Refueling </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The nuclear characteristics of the core assure that the reactor issubcritical even in its most reactive condition with the most reactivecontrol rod fully withdrawn during refueling. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When the mode switch is in REFUEL, only one control rod can be withdrawn.Selection of a second rod initiates a rod block, thereby preventing thewithdrawal of more than one rod at a time. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the refueling interlocks prevent any condition which couldlead to inadvertent criticality due to a control rod withdrawal error duringrefueling. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, the design of the control rod assembly, incorporatingthe velocity limiter, does not physically permit the upward removal ofthe control rod without the simultaneous or prior removal of the four adjacentfuel bundles, thus eliminating any hazardous condition. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fuel Assembly Insertion Error During Refueling </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The core is designed such that it can be made subcritical under themost reactive conditions with the strongest control rod fully withdrawn.Therefore, any single fuel bundle can be positioned in any available locationwithout violating the shutdown criteria, providing all the control rodsare fully inserted. The refueling interlocks require that all control rodsmust be fully inserted before a fuel bundle may be inserted into the core.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 2 - The proposed changes do not create the possibility ofa new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">No hardware modifications are required to implement these changes.The design functions of the SRM system are not being changed. The onlyeffects of these changes are a reduction in the minimum count rate requiredfor core alterations which remains bounded by the assumptions utilizedin the UFSAR, and an administrative change to the <T3>Bases </T3>to reflect the current organization. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 3 - The proposed changes do not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The <T3>Bases </T3>for Technical Specification 3.3.B and 4.3.B state in partthat the requirement of at least 3 counts per second assures that any transient,should it occur, begins at or above the initial value of 10-8 of ratedpower used in analyses of transient cold conditions. In fact, any observableneutron count rate on the SRM is sufficient to ensure the analyses remainvalid. Therefore, reduction of the minimum count rate for refueling fromthe nominal 3 cps to the values listed in Figure 3.3.1 will not significantlyreduce this margin of safety because any transient will still begin ator above 10-8 of rated power. Further, the SRMs are not required to ensurethe margin of safety as analyzed in Section 14 of the UFSAR. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis. Accordingly, theCommission has proposed to determine that the above changes do not involvea significant hazards consideration. The licensee has also proposed several administrative changes to correctthe title of a management position and to revise the Bases on TS page 110to reflect the above changes to the SRM minimum count rate. The Commissionhas provided guidance for the application of the criteria for no significanthazards consideration determination by providing examples of amendmentsthat are considered not likely to involve significant hazards considerations(51 FR 7751). These examples include: Example (i) ``A purely administrativechange to technical specifications: for example, a change to achieve consistencythroughout the technical specifications, correction of an error, or a changein nomenclature.'' The proposed changes are examples of such an administrativechange. Since these proposed changes are encompassed by an example forwhich no significant hazard considerations exist, the staff has made aproposed determination that the proposed changes involve no significanthazard considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Government Publications Section,State Library of Pennsylvania, Education Building, Commonwealth and WalnutStreets, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17126 <T3>Attorney for Licensee: </T3>Troy B.

A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licenseehas provided a discussion of the proposed changes as they relate to thesestandards; the discussion is presented below. The licensee has arrangedthese changes into three categories, with the first category having sixsub parts. The licensee's discussion of each of these categories and subparts is presented separately and is numbered consistently with the abovestandards. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Category I - Operating Limits for Fuel</T3> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Upgraded Safety Limit MCPR </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 1 - The Safety Limit MCPR is set such that no fuel damageis calculated to occur if the limit is not violated. It is determined usingthe NRC approved General Electric Thermal Analysis Basis (GETAB), whichis a statistical model that combines uncertainties in operating parameterswith uncertainties in the methods used to calculate critical power. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Upgrading the Safety Limit MCPR to 1.04 (1.05 for single recirculationloop operation) has been approved by the NRC for application to D-latticeplants operating with the second successive reload core of high bundleR-factor fuel types. This determination applies to Unit 3 since it is aD-lattice plant and all fuel types to be loaded for Cycle 8 operation (BP/P8X8R,LTA and GE8X8EB) are high bundle R-factor fuel types. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because the new Safety Limit MCPR is set such that no fuel damageis calculated to occur and thereby accomplishes the same purpose as theprevious limit, this change does not increase the probability or consequencesof any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 2 - Because the Safety Limit MCPR cannot initiate an accidentand imposing the new limit requires no changes in the current mode of operation,this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident than previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 3 - Upgrading the Safety Limit MCPR maintains the marginof safety established by the current limit. Both limits have received previousNRC approval in NEDE-24011-P-A. Thus, this change does not involve a significantreduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. GE8X8EB MAPLHGRs </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 1 - 10CFR50.46 establishes acceptance criteria for fuel andEmergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS). MAPLHGR limits are established toensure that the acceptance criteria are met. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This change provides MAPLHGR limits for the BD319A and BD321A (GE8X8EB)fuel assemblies. The MAPLHGRs have been calculated using NRC approved methodsand the results of the analysis (General Electric Company Document NEDE-24082-P-1,previously referenced) demonstrate that the acceptance criteria of 10CFR50.46are met with substantial margin. This change therefore does not increasethe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated (LOCA).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 2 - Because MAPLHGR limits can not initiate an accident andimposing the limits does not require any changes to the current mode ofoperation, this change does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident than previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 3 - The acceptance criteria of 10CFR50.46 establish the marginsof safety for fuel and the ECCS. Calculations using NRC approved methodsdescribed in NEDE-24082-P-1 yield results well within these acceptancecriteria. The maximum peak cladding temperature (PCT) for GE8X8EB fuelassemblies is evaluated to be [less than or equal to] 2089 F for a boundingvalue of MAPLHGR = 14.0 kw/ft, providing 111 F margin to the 2200 F limit.The actual MAPLHGR operating limits for the BD319A and BD321A fuel assembliesare [less than or equal to] 13.2 kw/ft, which results in a PCT for thosefuels of [less than or equal to] 1980 F. Since the maximum PCT for previousreloads of P8X8R fuel is 1954 F, the proposed amendment does not resultin a reduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. Constants Used to Determine Tau </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 1 - The constants used to calculate the adjusted analysismean scram time (Tau) are the mean and standard deviation of the scramspeed data base used in the determination of NRC approved MCPR adjustmentfactors. These new constants result in the calculation of a smaller andtherefore more restrictive Tau. Plants unable to meet the Tau criterionmust increase their operating limit MCPR. Plants that meet the Tau criterionoperate with MCPR limit defined in the Technical Specifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In summary, the MCPR operating limit is set such that fuel damageis not calculated to occur during a transient. The criterion is appliedto verify that the limit is appropriate. Since the new constants resultin a more restrictive Tau, this change does not involve an increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 2 - Based on the definition of Tau, Tau cannot initiate anaccident, and establishing Tau does not require any changes to the currentmode of operation; thus, this change does not create the possibility ofa new or different kind of accident than previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 3 - The change in the constants used to calculate Tau, resultsin a more restrictive criterion for applying the appropriate MCPR operatinglimit. The margin of safety is provided by the MCPR limit, which is increasedif the Tau criterion is not met. Therefore, this change does not resultin a reduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">D.LHGR Limit for GE8X8EB Fuel </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 1 - In NUREG-0800, ``Standard Review Plan for 4.2, Fuel SystemDesign, Revision 2, July, 1981,'' the NRC provides acceptance criteriafor fuel designs under accident conditions. Evaluations of the GE8X8EBdesign with the higher (14.4 kw/ft) LHGR limit using NRC approved methodsdescribed in NEDE-24011-P-A have been performed. The results of these evaluationsare documented in NEDE-24011-P-A, and demonstrate that the NRC acceptancecriteria are met with the higher LHGR limit. Because the acceptance criteriain [NUREG-0800] are all met, the proposed change does not increase theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 2 - Because the LHGR limit cannot initiate an accident, andimposing LHGR limits does not require any changes in the mode of operation,the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than previouslyevaluated is not created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 3 - The margin of safety is defined by the NRC acceptancecriteria of NUREG-0800. The NRC has reviewed and approved General Electricevaluations demonstrating that the GE8X8EB design is within the acceptancecriteria with a LHGR of 14.4 kw/ft. Therefore, the proposed amendment doesnot involve a reduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">E. New Operating Limit MCPRs </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 1 - The operating limit MCPR is set such that the safetylimit MCPR cannot be violated in the unlikely event of a transient. Theoperating limit MCPR is determined by adding the delta-CPR for the worsttransient to the safety limit MCPR. The transient delta-CPR is calculatedusing NRC approved methods described in NEDE-24011-P-A. The limiting abnormaloperational transients have been re-evaluated in detail for standard conditions:generator load rejection without bypass, loss of 100 degree F feedwaterheating, rod withdrawal error and feedwater controller failure. The limitingabnormal operational transients, generator load rejection without bypassand feedwater controller failure, were re-evaluated in detail for operationat Increased Core Flow with or without Final Feedwater Temperature Reduction.The feedwater controller failure transient was also re-evaluated in detailfor operation in the Extended Load Line Limit Analysis region.

The amendment would eliminate uncertainty as to whetherthe new transformer is a permissible offsite source, would achieve moreconsistency with the Standard Technical Specifications for boiling waterreactors and would include the additional transformer in the Bases. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)).

The licenseehas provided a discussion of the proposed changes as they relate to thesestandards; the discussion is presented below. <ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 1: The proposed revisions do not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Having two Unit 3 startup transformers available could increase theavailability of off-site power to support the required loads of the engineeredsafeguards equipment by decreasing the duration of a No. 3 startup sourceoutage in the event of a failure or scheduled maintenance. The No. 343startup transformer provides acceptable voltages to the plant as confirmedby calculations. Therefore, use of the No. 343 transformer and the proposedTechnical Specification revisions do not increase the probability of anoff-site power source trip or transient and, in turn, do not increase theprobability of an accident. The consequences of an accident are not affectedbecause the No. 343 transformer supplies sufficient power to mitigate theconsequences of design basis events in accordance with General Design Criterion17. Furthermore, without any off-site power available the diesel generatorssupply sufficient power to mitigate the consequences of an accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 2: The proposed revisions do not create the possibility ofa new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The No. 343 transformer design and installation were in accordancewith Peach Bottom licensing design criteria which ensure that its operationdoes not introduce any new unacceptable voltage conditions and that nonew failure modes were created. Furthermore, loss of all off-site power(all grid connections) has been evaluated and is within the plant's safetydesign basis (see UFSAR Sections 14.5.4.4 and 14.6.3.1). The diesel generatorsprovide sufficient power to support engineered safeguards equipment forone unit and the safe shutdown of the other unit, assuming loss of alloff-site power and failure of one diesel generator. In addition, each off-sitesource alone is sufficient for safe shutdown by supplying each of the 4kVemergency buses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Standard 3: The proposed revisions do not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The No. 343 startup transformer is a qualified alternate for the No.3 startup transformer, and provides additional redundancy in off-site powersupply for the engineered safeguards systems. Consequently, the availabilityof the No. 3 off-site power source could be increased. The proposed TechnicalSpecification revisions do not alter the intent of those Specificationsand the revisions do not reduce any safety margins as defined in TechnicalSpecification Bases. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

The amendmentwould revise the provisions in the Technical Specifications relating toradiological effluents. In particular, this proposed amendment changedELCO 8.1.1, ESR 8.1.1 and ESR 8.1.2. These changes are related to the designof the effluent monitor hand switches and the time allowed to report aninoperable monitor. Other changes are being made for clarification in accordancewith the licensee's application for amendment dated April 14, 1989. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The licensee has analyzed the proposed amendment request for significanthazards consideration using the standards in Title 10, Code of FederalRegulations, Part 50.92. The licensee has concluded that the proposed amendmentrequest involves no significant hazards consideration, based on the followinganalysis: <ITAG tagnum="21">The changes to ELCO 8.1.1.g)1) include a requirement for a four hourcheck of any relied upon monitor having only a local alarm and a 90 daytime limit. Currently, if the halogen or the particulate monitor becomesinoperable, gaseous effluents may continue to be released from the reactorbuilding vent system provided the effluent is continuously monitored withauxiliary sampling equipment. For noble gas, a grab sample taken every8 hours and analyzed within 24 hours is required when no alarmed monitoris available. These requirements will be maintained. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The local alarming monitors are installed as backup ventilation exhaustmonitors and powered from the Alternate Cooling Method (ACM) bus. The requirementto check the local alarm monitors every four hours will ensure any abnormalrelease is discovered and the problem corrected promptly. The 90 day timelimit on use of local alarming monitors will allow monitors which alarmin the Control Room to be repaired without unnecessarily reverting to grabsample mode. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The change to ELCO 8.1.1.g)2) clarifies the action when the requiredhalogen and particulate monitors are out of service. Power operation andeffluent releases may continue provided a continuous sample is collected.The sample will be obtained for analysis every 7 days and that analysiswill be performed within 48 hours. These changes are in accordance withthe intent of the Standard Technical Specifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The changes in ELCO 8.1.1.g)3) and 8.1.1.g)4) from ``both'' noblegas monitors to ``the required'' noble gas monitor are appropriate becausethere are more than two noble gas monitors which can serve this function.Only one noble gas monitor is required per ELCO 8.1.1.g)1). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The words ``or auxiliary sampling equipment'' have been deleted fromsection 8.1.1.g)3) because the devices previously considered to fulfillthis requirement are now considered to be among the devices which may beconsidered to be the required noble gas monitor. Additionally, the requirementto take eight hour grab samples and analysis within 24 hours is not altered.The grab samples will be taken if the required noble gas monitor becomesinoperable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The change to ELCO 8.1.1.g)8) is in accordance with commitments madeas part of Public Service Company of Colorado's response to NUREG-0737open items. The restoration time of 7 days and requirement for a specialreport within 14 days, if not restored in 7 days, is in accordance withthe guidance provided in Generic Letter 83-37, Item II.F.1.1. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The clarification of which instruments are to be reported for extendedperiods of inoperability is also included in ELCO 8.1.1.g)8). This is consistentwith the wording in the Standard Technical Specifications and PSC letterfrom Warembourg to Eisenhut, dated 2/9/84. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The change to ESR 8.1.1.d) is to clarify when a gamma spectral analysisof a sample from the in service gas waste tank is required. The purposeof this test is to maintain an inventory of the tanks' equivalent curies(Kr-88). This inventory is taken as the tanks are taken out of service.Therefore, only when a gas waste tank has been in service for 7 days ormore is it necessary to perform this test. 48 hours to complete the analysisof this sample is more definitive than the previous ``as soon as practicable''.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As stated in LER-87-012-00, the instrument controls for Fort St. Vrain's(FSV) Gaseous and Liquid Effluent Monitors cannot be set to a mode otherthan operate, designated ``MEASURE'' at FSV. The switch is spring loadedand will automatically return to ``MEASURE''. If the switch malfunctionsand remains in one of the other two possible positions, either a high radiationalarm will be received in the Control Room or the monitor's backgroundcount will be artificially elevated while it continues to measure effluentradiation levels. Thus, if the controls are not operating properly andthe mode switch is not in the ``MEASURE'' position, no unsafe conditionwould result. The testing of the switch for downscale failure, high countrate, and circuit failure will continue to be performed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Based on the above evaluation, it is concluded that operation of FortSt. Vrain in accordance with the proposed changes will not (1) involvea significant increase in the probability or the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, (2)create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction ina margin of safety. Therefore, this change will not increase the risk tothe health and safety of the public nor does it involve any significanthazards consideration. </ITAG>Based on the above evaluation, the licensee has concluded that the operationof Fort St. Vrain in accordance with proposed changes will involve no significanthazards consideration. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination. Based on the review and the above discussions, the staffproposes to determine that the proposed changes do not involve significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Greeley Public Library, CityComplex Building, Greeley, Colorado <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>J.

The fuel and control rod assemblieswill be described in the Core Design and Operating Limits Report and willbe evaluated in accordance with NRC approved methodologies. In addition,the Core Design and Operating Limits Report has been included in the definitionsSection of the Technical Specifications (TSs) to note that it is the unit-specificdocument that provides these limits for the current operating reload cycle.Furthermore, the definition notes that the values of these cycle-specificparameter limits are to be determined in accordance with the Specification6.9.1.9. This Specification requires that the Core Operating Limits bedetermined for each reload cycle in accordance with the referenced NRC-approvedmethodology for these limits and consistent with the applicable limitsof the safety analysis. Finally, this report and any mid-cycle revisionsshall be provided to the NRC upon issuance. Generic Letter 88-16, datedOctober 4, 1988, from the NRC, provided guidance to licensees on requestsfor removal of the values of cycle-specific parameter limits from TS. Thelicensee's proposed amendment is in response to this Generic Letter. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration ifoperation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment wouldnot: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed revision to the License Condition is in accordance with theguidance provided in Generic Letter 88-16 for licensees requesting removalof the values of cycle-specific parameter limits from TS. The establishmentof these limits in accordance with an NRC-approved methodology and theincorporation of these limits into the Core Design and Operating LimitsReport will ensure that proper steps have been taken to establish the valuesof these limits. Furthermore, the submittal of the Core Design and OperatingLimits Report will allow the staff to continue to trend the values of theselimits without the need for prior staff approval of these limits and withoutintroduction of an unreviewed safety question. The revised specificationswith the removal of the values of cycle-specific parameter limits and theaddition of the referenced report for these limits does not create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident for those previouslyevaluated. They also don't involve a significant reduction in the marginof safety since the change does not alter the methods used to establishthese limits. Consequently, the proposed change on the removal of the valuesof cycle-specific limits does not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Because the values of cycle-specific parameter limits will continue tobe determined in accordance with an NRC-approved methodology and consistentwith the applicable limits of the safety analysis, these changes are administrativein nature and do not impact the operation of the facility in a manner thatinvolves significant hazards considerations. The proposed amendment does not alter the requirement that the plant beoperated within the limits for cycle-specific parameters nor the requiredremedial actions that must be taken when these limits are not met. Whileit is recognized that such requirements are essential to plant safety,the values of limits can be determined in accordance with NRC-approvedmethods without affecting nuclear safety. With the removal of the valuesof these limits from the Technical Specifications, they have been incorporatedinto the Core Design and Operating Limits Report that is submitted to theCommission. Hence, appropriate measures exist to control the values ofthese limits. These changes are administrative in nature and do not impactthe operation of the facility in a manner that involves significant hazardsconsiderations. The staff has evaluated this proposed amendment and proposes to determinethat it involves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room Location: </T3>Pennsville Public Library,190 S.

TS Section 4.7.6.1.e.2would also be modified to eliminate the phrase ``Control Room VentilationAir Intake Chlorine Concentration - High Test Signal.'' The changes areproposed due to the replacement of the gaseous chlorination system witha liquid sodium hypochlorite system. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulationsin 10 CFR 50.59, this means that the operation of the facility in accordancewith the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The Commission has evaluated the proposed change against the above standardsas required by 10 CFR 50.91(a). The Commission has concluded that: A. The proposed change would not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an an accident previously evaluated becausethere no longer is any source of chlorine on or near the Davis-Besse sitethat would pose a threat to control room habitability, and thus requireautomatic isolation of the Control Room ventilation system. The proposedchange would not modify any accident conditions or assumptions. B. The proposed change would not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because there isno source of chlorine that would require automatic isolation of the ControlRoom ventilation system, and it is not possible to generate and releasethe quantity of chlorine with the new sodium hypochlorite system that wouldrequire automatic isolation. C. The changes would not involve a significant reduction in a margin ofsafety because the Chlorine Detection System is no longer needed to isolateautomatically the Control Room ventilation system.

The licensee has reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with the requirementsof 10 CFR 50.92 and has determined that the request does not involve asignificant hazard consideration. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the accidentconditions and assumptions are not affected by the proposed Technical Specificationand Bases changes. The effect on the availability of the snubbers due toan increase in the test interval has been shown to be negligible. The TechnicalSpecification requirement that all snubbers be functionally tested at leastonce every 15 years will be retained by increasing the initial sample sizeaccordingly for those inspection intervals greater than 18 months. Thiswill ensure that system reliability remains essentially unchanged. Furthermore,the proposed changes will allow the required snubber surveillance to beperformed during scheduled refueling outages, as was intended, and eliminatethe need for mid-cycle shutdowns solely for the purpose of performing thesurveillance. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because the accidentconditions and assumptions are not affected by the proposed Technical Specificationand Bases changes.

Change 1 modifies the Technical Specifications to add limiting conditionsfor operation and surveillance requirements dealing with the standby liquidcontrol (SLC) system, which will be enhanced by requiring an increasedconcentration of Boron-10. Change 2 modifies the Technical Specifications to add limiting conditionsfor operation and surveillance requirements for alternate rod injection(ARI) system. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).

The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendment against the standardsin 10 CFR 50.92 and has determined the following: <ITAG tagnum="21">Change 1. Vermont Yankee has determined that the requested changesassociated with the SLC System do not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated because the increase in SLC Systemcontrol capacity via Boron-10 enrichment effectively increasing the Boron-10injection rate does not alter the function of the system, method of operationor dual train configuration; the system response time to an ATWS eventhas been reduced as the increased Boron-10 enrichment of the solution providesfaster negative reactivity insertion thus reducing the consequences ofthe ATWS event; the SLC System is not credited in any of the design basisaccident analyses and, as such, is considered to provide only an additionalmitigative feature in the event of an accident; the SLC System sodium pentaboratesolution concentration and flow rate required by the NRC for reactivitycontrol independent of the control rods are not reduced from the valuespreviously evaluated and presented in the Technical Specifications; theaddition of enriched boron provides a shutdown margin greater than thepreviously calculated shutdown reactivity control capacity, and the changedoes not affect the possibility of an ATWS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident thanpreviously evaluated because the proposed changes involve a system whosefunction is to provide an additional mitigative shutdown capability andno system modifications are made; the addition of enriched boron does noteffect any system or component which could initiate an accident. Thus,no new or different unevaluated accident is created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because theaddition of enriched boron to the SLC System tank solution concentrationactually increases the capa bility of the SLC System to achieve cold shutdown;thus no margin of safety is reduced. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Change 2. Vermont Yankee has determined that the requested changesassociated with the ARI System do not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated because the addition of a specificreference to the ARI System in the Technical Specification does not resultin any system hardware modification or new plant configuration for operation.Thus, no FSAR accident consequences previously evaluated are impacted.Further, the ARI System is not postulated to initiate any accident scenarios;thus this change does not affect the probability of previously evaluatedaccidents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident thanpreviously evaluated because no new plant configuration for operation resultsfrom this change. The ARI System is a parallel to the RPT System and isactuated by the same trip circuitry and utilizes the same logic arrangementand sensors. Thus, no new or different unevaluated accident is createdby incorporating a specific reference to the ARI System within the TechnicalSpecifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because thischange involves no physical or procedural modifications. The change providesspecific reference in the Technical Specifications to the ARI System byincorporating limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requestsconsistent with those previously approved for the RPT System; thus no marginof safety is reduced. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Additionally, because these proposed amendments to the Vermont YankeeTechnical Specifications are directly associated with compliance with theATWS rule, they are similar to Example (vii) provided by the Commission(51FR7751, dated March 6, 1986) as one of the types of amendments not likelyto involve a significant hazards consideration. Example (vii) denotes anamendment to make a license conform to changes in the regulation when thelicense change results in very minor changes to facility operations clearlyin keeping with the regulations. Additionally, the changes proposed hereinalso resemble Example (ii), which denotes an amendment that constitutesan additional limitation, restriction or control not presently includedin the Technical Specifications, in that stricter operating and surveillancerequirements reflect additional conservatism. Based on the above, VermontYankee has determined that the proposed amendment involves no significanthazards considerations. </ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

The TS changewould provide margin for the anticipated NA-1andamp;2 lower RCS flow rates,while still maintaining operational parameters within the Updated FinalSafety Analysis Report (UFSAR) analysis envelope. The proposed TS change would lower the total RCS flow from 289,200 gallonsper minute (gpm) to 284,000 gpm by taking credit for previously unuseddesign margin without requiring an reanalysis of the UFSAR Chapter 15 accidentanalyses. The reduced RCS flow rate will be offset by the conservatisminherent in the existing calculated Departure from Nucleate Boiling Rates(DNBR) design margin. The RCS flow limit of TS Table 3.2-1 will therefore be lowered to 284,000gpm. This reduction will be offset by a retained DNBR margin penalty of2.9%, which is easily absorbed by the available retained DNBR margin. Thetotal remaining DNBR margin will still be approximately 7%. There are no other areas which are impacted by the limit change. Flow-rateditems such as loop transport times or RTD response times either includesubstantial margin in the safety analyses when compared to a change ofless than 2% or are insensitive to the actual value of the flow (i.e.,they are sensitive only to relative changes such as a fractional deviationfrom the measured full power delta T). Therefore, it is only necessaryto absorb the penalty on retained DNBR margin in order to support the flowlimit reduction. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licenseeprovided the following discussion regarding the above three criteria. <ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change to the [NA-1andamp;2 TS] minimum measured reactorcoolant system flow from 289,200 gpm to 284,000 gpm does not involve asignificant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination isas follows. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">anddegrees; There is no significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. Accident probability is not dependentupon the flow limit and as such is not affected by the limit change. Potentialaccident consequences remain within the bounds of the UFSAR accident analysesbecause the flow limit reduction is fully compensated by a penalty on retainedDNBR margin. As such there is no increase in potential consequences. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">anddegrees; The possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated is not created. The absence of a hardwarechange means that the accident initiators remain unaffected, so that nounique accident probability is created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">anddegrees; No significant reduction in the margin of safety is involved.These changes simply reflect the use of part of the available retainedDNBR margin in order to offset the flow limit reduction. The margin ofsafety for accident analysis does not include retained DNBR margin andthus is not impacted by this proposed change. </ITAG>The NRC staff has made a preliminary review of the licensee's analysesof the proposed change and agrees with the licensee's conclusion that thethree standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) are met.

Themeasurement range of the charging flow instrument will be changed from``0-150 gpm'' to ``0-180 gpm.'' The need for an expanded range was identifiedby the control room design review. In addition, Table 4.3-6 will be reorientedfrom a horizontal to a vertical format to agree with Table 3.3-9. Thereare no other changes to Table 4.3-6. During the performance of the Control Room Design Review (CRDR) for NA-1andamp;2,various indicators were cited as requiring modification, including chargingflow. The CRDR identified that the existing square root scale of the chargingflow instrumentation would make it difficult to read flow accurately andthat the range of 0-150 gpm was too narrow. To relieve these problems,the charging flow instrumentation will be changed to a linear output indicationand the range expanded to 0-180 gpm. Expanding the display range and providing the indication in a linear scalewill allow the operator to more accurately determine the charging flowrate during high or low flow rate conditions without decreasing accuracyduring middle of scale operations. This will provide for a more accuratedetermination of the charging flow rate during abnormal as well as normalplant conditions. TS 3.3.3.5, Table 3.3-9, identifies the instrumentation and ranges requiredin the auxiliary shutdown panel. The charging flow is specified as 0-150gpm and will be changed to 0-180 gpm as required by CRDR findings as notedabove. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)).

In addition, the Commissionhas provided guidance concerning the application of standards in 10 CFR50.92 by providing certain examples (51 FR 7750). One of the examples ofactions involving no significant hazards considerations is example (i),``a purely administrative change to the technical specifications: for example,a change to achieve consistency throughout the technical specifications,correction of an error or a change in nomenclature.'' The proposed reformattingof Table 4.3-6 is consistent with the standard in example (i).

For exigent circumstances,the Commission has either issued a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice providing opportunity for public commentor has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surroundinga licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission'sproposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commissionhas provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, usingits best efforts to make available to the public means of communicationfor the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments,the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licenseehas been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted,for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in preventionof either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up tothe plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunityto provide for public comment on its no significant hazards determination.In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunityfor comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment.If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, theState has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediatelyeffective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearingfrom any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any requiredhearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards considerationis involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made afinal determination that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documentsrelated to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued andmade effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendmentssatisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impactstatement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments.If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the specialcircumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determinationbased on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3)the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or EnvironmentalAssessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room for the particularfacility involved. A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to theU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director,Division of Reactor Projects. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respectto the issuance of the amendments. By July 28, 1989, the licensee may filea request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to thesubject facility operating license and any person whose interest may beaffected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party inthe proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene. Requestsfor a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordancewith the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings''in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to interveneis filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition andthe Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board willissue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceedingand how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested,it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held wouldtake place while the amendment is in effect. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.
