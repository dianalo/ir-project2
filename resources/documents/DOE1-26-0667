The grounding padsare kept at zero electric potential, i.e. grounded. The grounding servesto drain away electrons and thereby prevent an unwanted accumulationof charge in the spaces, and cause the electric field lines to be moreperpendicular to the detectors in regions near the grounding pads. Alternatively,no empty space is provided there being additional, grounded, detectorsprovided between the data and reference detectors.</TEXT></DOC>
