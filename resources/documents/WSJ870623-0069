As previously reported, JWT is currently evaluating a $50.50-a-share, or about $515 million, friendly merger proposal from another British firm, WPP Group PLC, a London-based marketing services concern. New York-based JWT also is studying alternatives to the offer, including taking the company private in a leveraged buyout.    Separately, Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., New York, said it holds a 7.3% JWT stake for itself and for the accounts of its clients. WPP controls nearly 5% of JWT's about 10 million shares outstanding and Quantum Media Inc., a media and entertainment concern 50%-owned by MCA Inc., said it holds a 4.7% JWT interest.    A source close to JWT said the company also had been approached by representatives of former executives of Ted Bates Worldwide Inc. to discuss a possible friendly acquisition of JWT. The source didn't disclose the identities of the former Ted Bates executives. Several Ted Bates officials left the agency last year when it was acquired by Saatchi andamp; Saatchi PLC of Britain.    John Wood, chairman of Trilateral Communications Ltd., the British andamp; Commonwealth affiliate, said he has been contacted three times by JWT officers in different JWT units. &quot;We are awaiting events,&quot; said Mr. Wood. He declined to name the officers or put a price on JWT.    In New York, a spokesman for JWT, a major advertising, market research and public relations firm, declined to comment on Mr. Wood's statements.    Mr. Wood also is a partner in Wood Brigdale, Nisbet andamp; Robinson Ltd., a medium-sized, London-based ad agency in which British andamp; Commonwealth holds a 24% stake. The 45-year-old American, who has worked in London for 24 years, said his agency is very &quot;low-profile&quot; and concedes that a JWT takeover would seem unlikely. He adds, however, that &quot;these are very strange times. You literally can come out of nowhere.&quot;    As reported previously, JWT executives have been holding separate talks with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and at least two other firms about taking the advertising concern private in a leveraged buyout, sources close to JWT have said. JWT officials were meeting with representatives of the different concerns yesterday, a source close to the talks said.    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bear Stearns said it holds 708,376 JWT common shares, purchased &quot;as an investment in the ordinary course of its business as a broker-dealer.&quot; About half of its stake is held by Bear Stearns's arbitrage department, the filing said. A Bear Stearns spokeswoman declined to comment further.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, JWT closed at $52.75, up 75 cents.    Meanwhile, WPP said it temporarily extended the deadline on its $50.50-a-share acquisition proposal after JWT said it wouldn't be able to respond by Monday's 12:01 p.m. deadline. In a letter to WPP, JWT said it was considering &quot;a number of options&quot; to WPP's offer.    Also, WPP said it amended a lawsuit filed last week in Delaware state court that seeks to invalidate JWT's &quot;fair price&quot; provision, which could hinder WPP's takeover bid. In the amended suit, WPP, citing reports of a possible leveraged buyout of JWT, charges JWT with negotiating with possible bidders on a &quot;preferred basis, providing them with information unavailable to WPP.&quot; WPP seeks a court order forcing JWT to disclose any such information to WPP.    A JWT spokesman said JWT &quot;categorically rejects&quot; the charges. </TEXT></DOC>
