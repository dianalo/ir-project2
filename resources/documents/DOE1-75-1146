The findings of theiraerosol lung inhalation scintigrams were classified into 4 patterns,as type I: homogeneous distribution without hot spot formation, typeII: peripheral homogeneity with central hot spot formation, type IIID(-): inhomogeneous distribution with hot spot formation, but withoutdefect, and type IIID (+): with defect. These aerosol patterns were comparedwith those of previously reported adult cases and with the severity ofbronchial asthma. Normal pattern of type I was found in 5 cases (12%)of our infantile asthmatics in contrast to previously reported adultcases, in which none of normal pattern was found. There were differencesbetween type II and type III in both distribution and disappearance timeof hot spot, which indicated that the two types differed from each otherin radioaerosol deposition mechanism. There was no significant correlationbetween type I and type II in the severity of asthma and the frequencyof asthmatic attack. Type II may be clinically considered to be the sametype as type I. There is the statistically significant difference betweentype I, II and type III in the frequency of asthmatic attack, but notin the severity of asthma, although most of serious cases showed typeIII. Aerosol lung inhalation scintigraphy is a useful examination forchildren with bronchial asthma in which lung function tests may be difficultto perform.</TEXT></DOC>
