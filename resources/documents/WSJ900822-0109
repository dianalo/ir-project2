He came with histwo brothers and two friends, all in the front seat of a tinytruck.   In his first attempt a week ago, he and four Americanswere turned back in the desert by Iraqi soldiers. Mr. Nagibsaid the soldiers took away the Americans.   &quot;There was a lot of shooting, but I don't know whathappened to them,&quot; he said.   The desert, according to Mr. Nagib and others, was studdedwith land mines. He and his companions said they saw rocketsand missiles being deployed along the Persian Gulf in Kuwaitby Iraqi troops. The editor of Jane's Soviet IntelligenceReview in London said yesterday that Iraq has moved 36missile launchers and 800 Soviet-built or Iraqi-modifiedballistic missiles into Kuwait.   Mr. Nagib said Iraqi soldiers &quot;robbed us of everything wehad -- our money, a television set, a radio and a vacuumcleaner.&quot; He added, &quot;We hate them. They have attackedeveryone and robbed everyone.&quot;   Mahmoud Alweh, an Egyptian teller in Kuwait City'sInternational Bank, left a week ago with his wife and twosmall sons in a Chevrolet.   &quot;We lost everything,&quot; he said. &quot;Our house, our money, 12years' worth of savings. You could lose your mind.&quot;   On the morning after Iraq's Aug. 2 raid on Kuwait City,Mr. Alweh said he went to the supermarket for provisions: &quot;Itwas incredibly crowded. People were buying everything theycould get their hands on, whether they needed it or not.&quot;   When he got back to his house, he said, soldiers filledhis street. &quot;By nightime bombs were falling and there wasshooting all night. My son was shaking. In the morning, thestreets were filled with blood and bloody clothes, shoes,shirts and soldiers' caps.&quot;   The streets in Kuwait City were littered with &quot;thousands&quot;of cars, Mr. Alweh said, many of which had burned. Many carswere &quot;just stolen,&quot; said Mr. Alweh.   The banker's wife said &quot;they raped many.&quot; She saidsoldiers also stole jewelry. Mr. Alweh said soldiers robbedjewelry stores and electrical appliance stores.   &quot;Where will I go now?&quot; asked Mr. Alweh. &quot;Anywhere would bebetter. We have been driving eight days. We have been hungryand thirsty.&quot;   Mohammed Hussein, an Egyptian air-conditioner salesman wholeft with his brother and two small daughters, said Kuwaitisoldiers and civilians offered scattered resistance. He saidone Kuwaiti loaded his car with explosives and charged ahospital near the town of Shouera where Iraq's military hadset up a command post.   Drinking water and orange soda at the Ali Baba restauranthere, Mr. Hussein complained of crowds and delays in Aqaba.He said he waited four days there before being able to catcha ferry to Egypt. Egyptian officials say 5,000 to 8,000people are traveling from Aqaba to Nuweiba each day. They sayas many as 20,000 Egyptians and 800 Sudanese are waiting inAqaba. The Egyptian consulate provided free food to therefugees.   Jordanian officials have asked Iraq to try to slow theflow of refugees.
