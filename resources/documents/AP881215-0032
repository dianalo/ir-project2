TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. decision to start a dialogue withYasser Arafat's PLO could increase political divisions in Israel ata time when sensitive talks are under way to form a new government.   It could also put Israel on a collision course with its mainbenefactor for the first time since the Lebanon war in 1982.   Initial reactions indicated both major political parties, PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc and Foreign Minister ShimonPeres' Labor Party, opposed the U.S. move and would stand togetherin rejecting the Palestine Liberation Organization as a partner fornegotiations.   But if the U.S.-PLO talks go well, it will put pressure on Israelto join the process. This could deepen the Labor-Likud split on thepeace issue and thwart talks on a power-sharing coalition.   Shamir has said Arafat's new moderation was a ``mirage'' andIsrael would never accept the PLO as a negotiating partner. He hasargued the PLO's true aim remains the destruction of Israel.   Moshe Arens, a candidate for foreign minister in the nextgovernment and a close ally of Shamir, said the only possibility fora change in Israel's view was if the PLO made good on its pledge toabstain from terror.   ``Let's say that if a year or two goes by and there are no actsof terrorism, maybe some people in Israel will look at him in adifferent light,'' Arens said on the NBC-TV Today show.   Peres criticized the PLO for failing to renounce the violenceassociated with the Palestinian uprising, such as throwing firebombsat Israeli vehicles, but he praised Arafat for having ``learned tosay peace.'' The yearloing uprising has claimed the lives of atleast 323 Palestinians and 13 Israelis.   Peres favors an international peace conference proposed by theArabs and is willing to trade some occupied land for a peaceagreement.   Both ideas are vehemently opposed by Shamir, who says aU.N.-sponsored forum would be biased against Israel and that Israelwould become weak and vulnerable if it gave up the West Bank andGaza Strip, home to about 1.7 million Palestinians and 70,000 Jewishsettlers.   Peres is under pressure from dovish Labor members and liberalsallied with the party to encourage the peace process, even with thePLO. If he does so, he will come into conflict with Shamir and thepossibility of another coalition government may evaporate.   ``If the government stands by its position (opposing talks withthe PLO), I believe the Palestinian uprising and the prospects forwar will both grow,'' warned Ran Cohen, a parliament member of theliberal Citizens Rights Movement, which was allied with Labor in theNov. 1 parliament elections.   ``We are at a crossroads between war and peace. The governmentmust decide now,'' said Cohen.   Yossi Beilin, a leading Labor Party dove and former Peres aide,said it was ``too early to say'' if the U.S. move would have animpact on coalition talks that had appeared to be making headwayafter six weeks of on-again, off-again negotiations. Likud won 40seats and Labor 39 in 120-member parliament.   Shamir, who has until Dec. 26 to present a new government toPresident Chaim Herzog, has said he could form a government withoutLabor. It would be made up of small religious and right-wingfactions that favor annexation of the occupied territories and moreJewish settlements.   But such a government would be weak and isolated internationally,especially if the new U.S. administration exerts pressure on Israelto join the dialogue.   The United States has been Israel's main military, economic andpolitical supporter. Israel receives $3 billion a year in U.S. aid,more than any other country, and the U.S. veto in the U.N. SecurityCouncil has staved off economic sanctions and other anti-Israelimeasures.   U.S. administrations have rarely brought pressure on Israel, butin 1982 President Reagan temporarily halted delivery of F-16 fighterplanes during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which the U.S.opposed.   The United States also held out the possibility of increased aidas an inducement to Israel and Egypt during peace negotiations thatresulted in Israel's only peace treaty with an Arab state in 1979.   To withstand such pressure, Likud parliament member Benny Begin,the son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, said Labor andLikud should present a united front.   ``This development highlights the necessity of establishing anational unity government that would withstand this very gravethreat,'' he said.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Nicolas Tatro, The Associated Press' bureau chiefin Jerusalem, has covered the Middle East for the past 12 years fromposts in Cairo, Tehran, Beirut and Jerusalem.</TEXT></DOC>
