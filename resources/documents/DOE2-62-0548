Political chicanery and monumentaltechnological and economic foresight, professional weakness and vacillationin the engineering community and the vicious pseudo scientific propagandaof most branches of the media, the teaching profession and sadly, eventhe politicisation of our churches, has all but destroyed a potentialAustralian ''sunrise industry''. Over the next forty years the populationof planet Earth will approximately double. Unless Australians realisethat their children and grand-children, and future generations of ourneighbouring third world countries will require nuclear technology foran equitable and acceptable shared life-style, they will continue toallow taxpayers' money to be wasted on costly, technically unacceptableand environmentally undesirable attempts to develop ''alternative'' or''renewable'' energy sources. These are neither alternative nor renewablebut politically trendy. The tragedy of such projects is that their limitedapplicability and suitability for small scale energy production by wealthyusers in limited geographical locations will only increase the need forbase load energy supplies of the conventional type. Unless this is nuclear,planet Earth faces environmental despolation of monumental proportions.(J.P.N.).</TEXT></DOC>
