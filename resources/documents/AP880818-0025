That's when Bush is scheduled to formally accept the party'snomination.   ``The blacks supported Jesse in numbers as high as 97 percent inmany of the primaries,'' Robertson said. ``Evangelicals on theother hand were divided.   ``They were not monolithic,'' he said. ``That's not a bad thing,but it limits their effectiveness.''   Robertson had been considered something of a wild card in theRepublican presidential field, but he was never able to move beyondhis base of fundamentalist Christians and quickly fell by thewayside. Some have compared his role in the Republican Party withJackson's among Democrats, but the two candidates have resistedsuch comparisons.   On Wednesday, however, Robertson conceded that one of the majorflaws in his campaign was that he was unable to mobilize hispolitical base as effectively as did Jackson.   Robertson said he garnered a plurality among fundamentalistsduring the early tests, but probably never won more than half ofthose voting.   ``I was coming out No. 1, but I wasn't coming out with 60, or70, or 80, or 90 percent of them like Jesse Jackson was among blackpeople,'' Robertson said. ``I don't think I even had more thanhalf. That's sort of the polls I've read.   ``The biggest thing I was facing was not antagonism, butapathy,'' he said.   The former television evangelist conceded that other Republicancandidates were able to make significant inroads into his base.   ``Each candidate spoke to the evangelicals addressing theirconcerns, they all addressed the issues,'' he said. ``There was noclear choice, like this is this good guy, and this is the bad guy.   ``If I were a candidate in the future, I think more and more ofthe evangelicals would say `this man is the leader among us,'''Robertson said.   Robertson expressed confidence that he would be handed a role inthe fall election campaign, but said no details had been spelledout.   ``I'll be doing some traveling myself,'' Robertson said. ``I'msure they want our help.''   In addition, Robertson said he would launch a voter registrationdrive among fundamentalists, where he said there are large numbersstill uninterested in politics despite his campaign.   Robertson was evasive on questions about his future in theRepublican Party, but said there are no signs that his backers areleaving the political arena.   ``The people who are there now want to continue, so that's thestart of a base,'' Robertson said.   He rejected suggestions that that stance represented a threat toGOP unity, or that his forces would seek to take control of theparty's machinery.   ``I don't like the concept of takeover,'' Robertson said. ``It'snot necessary to do that.''   He conceded the potential for conflict between his backers andthe party establishment.   ``There are cultural differences between some of theevangelicals and some of the wealthier members of the RepublicanParty,'' Robertson said.</TEXT></DOC>
