Carlucci said the West should not be lulled by last week'ssuperpower summit in Moscow.   ``Until we see some tangible changes we should not change ourpolicies,'' he told the Japan National Press Club. ``We are stillfacing a serious military threat.''   He said Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program ofperestroika _ restructuring Soviet society and the economy _emphasizes improving technology. Carlucci said the Soviet Uniontraditionally has obtained technology through sources other than itsown research, including stealing it.   Carlucci said that the United States has at least a 10-year edgeover the Soviet Union in computer technology.   The defense secretary said the way to maintain that lead isthrough the Coordinating Committee for Export Control, whichregulates technology transfer to communist countries. He saidmodifications should be made to tighten restrictions on sensitivetechnology and loosen controls on lower-tier technology.   ``It is vital for our collective security that we seek tostrengthen COCOM,'' Carlucci said.   Last year, a subsidiary of Toshiba Corp. was accused of exportingsophisticated technology to the Soviet Union.   Carlucci warned that perestroika could lead to further Sovietmilitarization.   ``If the end result is the West relaxes its defense effort andthe Soviet Union modernizes its military and industrial base, andthe Soviet Union can manufacture enormously more weapons than today,then we will have made a grave mistake,'' he said.   Carlucci arrived in Japan last week from Moscow to brief leadershere on the meeting between President Reagan and Gorbachev and todiscuss U.S.-Japanese security issues with Japan's defense andgoverning party officials.   The defense secretary lauded the dialogue between Moscow andWashington that is made easier by the summits.   ``Summits like the one just concluded make good sense,'' he said.``But as we focus on the summit process, we must not lose sight ofthis central fact: better relations must be built on a strongfoundation _ our ability to defend ourselves and our interests.Summitry is no substitute for security.''   He noted that ``we as yet see no change in the Soviet offensivemilitary structure.''</TEXT></DOC>
