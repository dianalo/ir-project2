Salomon managed $34.8 billion of offerings in the first three quarters of the year. First Boston Corp. placed second, with $32.4 billion, followed by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., with $27.9 billion.    Salomon's third-quarter volume of $10 billion, however, put it in third place for the quarter, behind First Boston, with $11.2 billion, and Morgan, with $11.1 billion. Salomon's market share dropped to 13.4% in the third quarter from 15.2% in the second.    Rising interest rates continued to hold overall underwriting volume down. While volume rose slightly in the third quarter -- to $72 billion from the second quarter's $69 billion -- it was still sharply lower than the first-quarter level of $96 billion.    Largely because of the strong first quarter, 1987 underwriting volume is still running ahead of the 1986 figure. Last year at this time, U.S. issuers had sold $233.3 billion of securities in the U.S. and abroad. So far this year, they've sold $242 billion.    Here are the year-to-date rankings for the top 10 firms, as of late yesterday. Underwriters are ranked by world-wide issues for U.S. companies only, with credit given only to the lead manager.    ---                                                    Market                                $ Volume            Share   Salomon Brothers ............. 34.85            14.4%   First Boston ................. 32.42            13.4   Morgan Stanley ............... 27.93            11.6   Merrill Lynch Cap.
