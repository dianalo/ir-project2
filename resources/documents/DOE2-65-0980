<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-65-0980 </DOCNO><TEXT>Analog superconductive components have been integrated to form a devicecapable of cross-correlation between two wideband analog input signals.Arrays of Nb/Nb/sub 2/O/sub 5/Pb tunnel junctions perform the mixingof delayed samples of two frequency-offset analog signals counterpropagatingalong a niobium tapped transmission line. The resultant mixer productsfrom the junction array are integrated and stored in a high-Q ({approx}600) lumped element L-C resonator tuned to the signal difference frequency.A superconductive tunnel junction embedded in the resonator circuit isoperated as a variable-threshold comparator to detect the time-integratedcurrent stored in the resonator. The authors present results showingthe correlation properties of such an individual correlator cell, togetherwith the design and performance of a 4-junction-logic (4JL)-based digitaladdress encoder to be used in a multichannel correlator device. Theyalso discuss the important design issues as they relate to analog signalprocessing.</TEXT></DOC>
