(MTI) of Anaheim,Calif., is willfully infringing on four patents pertaining to DEC's StandardDisk Interconnect (SDI) and Standard Tape Interconnect (STI) controllertechnologies.andM;The DEC suit alleges that MTI copied the proprietary controller technologyfor use in its MA-series tape and MDI-series disk products.andM;The suit seeks a court-ordered injunction preventing MTI from producing andselling any &quot;equipment or products used in place of Digital's Standard Diskand Standard Tape Interconnect controller products.&quot;andM;&quot;MTI's unauthorized use of the technology is not only unfair, but illegal.andO;They're stealing our technology.andP;  We are very serious about the enforcementof our intellectual property rights,&quot; said Charles Christ, DEC's vicepresident for mass storage.andM;DEC is petitioning the court for monetary damages from MTI for lost revenuesresulting from the alleged infringement.andP;  DEC also seeks treble damages,citing MTI's &quot;intentional, willful and wanton violation of Digital's patentrights.&quot;andM;As of early last week, MTI had not received the suit.andP;  &quot;We haven't receivedthe lawsuit yet, which we think shows that this suit is marketing-drivenbecause they are taking advantage of the press opportunities before the suitis delivered,&quot; said MTI President Steve Hamerslag.andM;&quot;DEC's posturing here is crazy.andP;  andlsqb;These are] unfair business practices.andP;  Weconsider this a frivolous lawsuit and will defend it vigorously,&quot; Hamerslagsaid.andM;MTI, which counts Novell Chairman Ray Noorda as one of its prime investors,is a $100 million business that will be able to well afford the legalexpenses of defending itself, he added.andM;MTI will indemnify all of its customers should it lose the suit, according tolongstanding company practice, he said.andM;Along with notice of the legal proceedings against MTI, DEC announced what itterms a &quot;voluntary phase-out program,&quot; through which third parties sellingSDI-and STI-compatible products are invited to refrain from selling thoseproducts in exchange for SCSI, Turbochannel and Futurebus licenses.andM;The phase-out program requires participants to discontinue their SDI and STIproducts by December 1992, and to remunerate DEC for use of the technologyprior to and during the phaseout, according to DEC's Christ.andP;  The phase-outprogram would also extend incentives for early compliance, Christ said.andM;The framework for the program was derived from an out-of-court settlementreached in December by DEC and System Industries (SI) of Milpitas, Calif., aDEC spokeswoman said.andP;  That settlement resolved a similar patent infringementsuit brought by DEC against SI in April 1989.andP;  (See &quot;SI settles HSClitigation out of court; compensates DEC,&quot; DR, Dec. 17, 1990, page 1.)andM;&quot;We're delighted [that DEC has filed suit against MTI].andP;  We're pleased to seeDEC take action.andP;  We knew they would work to even the playing field,&quot; said SIPresident Paul Emory.andM;DEC recently proposed the phaseout to MTI, according to DEC's Christ.andP;  &quot;Wetalked with MTI and they rejected the notion of a voluntary phaseout [of SDI-and STI-compatible products],&quot; he said.andM;MTI's Hamerslag counters that DEC's accusation of MTI ignoring its offer &quot;isabsolutely, positively not true; they never made us an offer.&quot;andP;  He added,however, that MTI has no interest in a settlement under which MTI wouldbecome a distributor of DEC disk drives, or have to pay DEC damages.andM;A deal that would allow MTI to license SDI and STI is not on the table,according to DEC's Christ.andP;  &quot;We are not offering to license SDI and STI,&quot; hesaid.andM;MTI will attempt to demonstrate prior art for HSC patents that it believesare not valid and that it may consider filing an antitrust suit, Hamerslagsaid.andM;Christ dismissed arguments that the patents are not valid.andP;  &quot;If there wereprior art, these patents wouldn't have been issued,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
