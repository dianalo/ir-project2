Although Housing Secretary Jack Kemp has said he would notsacrifice programs for the poor to cure the problems he inherited, aHouse Appropriations subcommittee voted earlier this week to denymoney in the fiscal 1990 budget year for the Moderate RehabilitationProgram.   ``It was a program shot full of fraud and abuse,'' subcommitteechairman Rep. Bob Traxler said today in xplaining the panel'saction. ``It's time we step back and determine what fixes may benecessary.''   Traxler, D-Mich., said the decision was neither ``irrevocable''nor ``permanent'' because the Senate traditionally had allocatedmoney for the program despite its omission from Reaganadministration budget requests.   Traxler said the Bush administration, like its predecessor, alsomade no provision for funding the Moderate Rehabilitation Program inits proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.   ``I will not predict what the Senate's view of this will be,'' hesaid.   Rep. Bill Green of New York, the ranking Republican on Traxler'ssubcommittee, said the panel will direct HUD, in an upcoming report,to write regulations prohibiting the use of consultants in anyfuture use of the $200 million in unspent Moderate Rehabilitationfunds.   The little-noticed vote on Tuesday made the Section 8 ModerateRehabilitation Program the first casualty of the series of internalHUD investigations and congressional inquiries into widespreadinfluence-peddling, mismanagement and corruption at the departmentduring the Reagan years.   Meanwhile, the Senate Banking Committee voted today to begin itsown investigation of the HUD scandals. An investigation already wasunder way by a House Government Operations subcommittee.   The panel will look at ``management and other activities'' inconnection with the Moderate Rehabilitation Program, the use ofgovernment co-insurance and income tax credits between 1978 and 1988.   The committee also voted to send the nomination of Frank Keatingas HUD's general counsel to the full Senate for confirmation.   The panel's vote follows two days of intensive questioning ofKemp by two House panels about the future of several of the agency'stroubled programs.   Kemp assured worried members of Congress that he acted within hisauthority in suspending some programs amid allegations ofinfluence-peddling and mismanagement.   Members of the House Banking Committee on Wednesday questionedKemp's legal authority to suspend programs and warned him not to usescandals at his agency to eliminate programs for low- ormiddle-income Americans.   ``I wish to emphasize once again, we are the committee thatauthorizes programs, makes the changes in them, or terminatesthem,'' said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the House BankingCommittee.   Saying he has suspended rather than terminated programs, Kempreplied that he will submit a legal analysis supporting hisauthority to act.   Keating said Thursday he was ``confident'' Kemp had authority tocancel the Title X Land Development Mortgage Insurance program whichwas the focus of the panel members' questions.   Kemp pledged not to allow problems at the housing agency to beused as a ``subterfuge'' to eliminate programs.   Meanwhile, the New York Times reported today that auditors havedetermined that losses in the department's Federal HousingAdministration will reach $1 billion, twice the previously estimatedfigure, largely because of losses in the ``co-insurance'' program.   Under that program, private insurers assume responsibility for 20percent of the insurance for the department's mortgages. Thenewspaper said the FBI has begun to look into the affairs of DRGFunding Corp., once the largest co-insurer but now suspended fromthe program.   Kemp has in recent months suspended or revised several federalhousing programs after allegations by HUD's inspector general andothers that they were riddled with abuse, mismanagement,influence-peddling and favoritism.   Much of his time since taking over the agency six months ago hasbeen spent answering questions about possible abuses during theeight years of the Reagan administration.   ``I do not want to be known as the secretary who abandoned theneeds that people have,'' Kemp told the House Employment and HousingSubcommittee on Tuesday.   ``Your good intentions are not questioned here, but the tools youuse to respond to these scandals must be reviewed by us,'' Gonzalez,D-Texas, told Kemp at Wednesday's Banking Committee hearing.   ``We need to know where you are going with the termination ofprograms,'' added Rep. Chalmers P. Wylie, R-Ohio.   Several committee members expressed concern that programcancellations would harm poor people in their districts.   ``The national scandal is the tip of the iceberg,'' said Rep.Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio. ``There are some local scandals.''   In one such case, 13 people were indicted in Hauppauge, N.Y.,Wednesday on state charges of fraudulently obtaining funds from afederally subsidized program that made houses available to poorfamilies.   Kemp also pledged to curb the use of consultants on HUDsubsidized projects.   Several congressmen have introduced legislation to limit the roleand fees of consultants in such projects, and to require fulldisclosure of the use of consultants.   Kemp said he will seek to revoke waivers granted by the Office ofGovernment Ethics to the post-employment lobbying restriction for 58senior jobs at HUD in an effort to close the revolving door betweengovernment agencies and private firms that do business with them.   In April, Kemp suspended 1989 funding for the moderaterehabilitation program after an inspector general's report saidprojects were chosen as the result of influence-peddling andfavoritism for former HUD and other government officials whoreceived big fees as developers and consultants.</TEXT></DOC>
