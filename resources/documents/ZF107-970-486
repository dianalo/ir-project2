(including) up-linkcapability, which lets the Scitex operator bring in high-res scans done onCrosfield, Hell or other drum scanners and pass a lower-res viewfile to theVisionary system.&quot;andM;The capacity to transfer low-res viewfiles to Visionary is not marketed as aperipheral, but as a standard component of every Gateway system.andP;  And thehigh-res scans are not limited to those from drum scanners--many, in fact,come from Scitex's Smart Scanner, a CCD flatbed color input unit.andM;&quot;.  .  .  The high-res image can be spliced in (with the requestedtransformations) when the Visionary user sends the file back.&quot;andM;&quot;Spliced&quot; implies that some complex operator interactions are required toperform this operation.andP;  In fact, when the Visionary page geometry file istransferred to the Scitex production system, image transformations (position,cropping, scaling, rotation) are automatically applied to the high-resolutionimages without any operator intervention.andM;Also, the $3,000 cost for Visionary workstation software includes a modifiedversion of Quark Xpress; additional features include close-crop and rotatefunctionality, and an electronic annotation layer; desktop scanner driver, aswell as the on-line interface to the Scitex Response system and thetelecommunications package.andP;  Eric Kraus, Manager Corporate CommunicationsScitex America Corp. Eight Oak Park Dr. Bedford, MA 01730andM;And from the user'sandM;view .andP;  .  .andM;Some corrections/clarifications on your Scitex Visionary and VIP article:Visionary is 90% QuarkXPress.andP;  However, Scitex has modified the program andadded some important features: the ability to rotate images and/or pictureboxes, the ability to make FPO masks for images, a polygon tool, the abilityto make precise grids and save them as templates, etc.andP;  Due to the extensivemodifications, Visionary is really a similar but separate program.andP;  Quarkfiles cannot be read in Visionary any more than Quark can read PageMakerfiles.andP;  (By the way, if the user has a strong traditional productionbackground, rather than a desktop background, the change from PageMaker toQuarkXPress is not as alien as one might think.)andM;If Adobe/Linotype fonts are used on a Visionary page (or any other PostScriptprogram), the page is processed through VIP and sent over to the Scitex as alinework file.andP;  This file has all the Adobe fonts intact; Bitstream fontswould never be substituted for Adobe fonts.andP;  Bitstream screen fonts arenormally used on the Macintosh when using Visionary, and are used to spectext as one would always do.andP;  These fonts are not substituted from Visionaryto Scitex any more than the PostScript printer fonts are substituted when yououtput to a laser printer or send a Bandamp;W page to a Linotronic device.andO;Bitstream type A or C printer fonts are used to proof to PostScript printers,type F fonts are used on the Scitex.andP;  (Adobe's fonts do not exist anywhereelse except as PostScript; matching Bitstream fonts are available for use inPostScript, traditional typesetting units, and color systems such as Scitex,Crosfield, and Hell.)andM;A typical user would purchase the system called a Primary Design Station,which consists of the Macintosh system you mentioned, plus a color scanner(Sharp or Howtek are supported), a printer (Mitsubishi or QMS for color, anyPostScript laser printer for Bandamp;W), a 9600-baud modem, and a 40-MB removablehard disk.andP;  This hardware costs about $30-40,000 and can be bought from aScitex system owner or from a computer store.andP;  A Visionary Jr.andP;  setup wouldcost about $7-10,000 (without printer or scanner).andP;  The only special item auser would have to purchase would be the Visionary software for $3,000 orVisionary Jr.andP;  for $1,000.andM;Visionary Gateway and VIP are for use only by the Scitex system owner.andP;  TheGateway and VIP have to send their files directly to the Scitex system, soobviously a user would not need these items.andP;  Users only have to send intheir Visionary or PostScript files.andP;  The $87,000 cost that the Scitex systemowner pays also includes a licensing fee to Scitex America.andP;  David CreamerTSI Graphics 70 Jackson Drive Cranford, NJ 07016andM;Mismatched font widthsandM;The sample Elixir form which was regrettably printed in the November 1, 1989issue of the Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing was submitted to a Seyboldreviewer to illustrate a discrepancy of the widths in the Bitstream fontsused in the form.andP;  Thus, all of the imprecision of the text reported did notreflect upon the technical capabilities of the ElixiForm product.andP;  Wenotified the reviewer when we gave him this form that the sample illustratedhow the Bitstream fonts had widths which were different from the Adobe fontson the Linotype imagesetter.andP;  For your information, Bitstream has informedElixir that they will be supplying us with Adobe-compatible fonts.andM;Elixir is very proud of its technical prowers in producing complex forms witha high degree of accuracy.andP;  Hundreds of thousands of forms have been producedby our Fortune 500 customers over the last 3 years.andP;  We enclose a sample formproduced by one such customer.andP;  This customer has used Elixir to produce andmaintain every federal, state and local tax form and has filed over 5 milliontax returns annually based upon these Elixir forms.andP;  Dot-for-dot accuracy isone of the most powerful features of ElixiForm and is an absolute requirementof the federal, state and local governments and Xerox's very demandingcustomers.andP;  Bruce Damer Elixir Technologies Corporation 2670 Carmar Drive LosAngeles, CA 90046andM;We apologize for the misunderstanding.andP;  Unfortunately, the reporter weassigned to cover forms software at the Computer Publishing Conference isbased in Italy and didn't have an opportunity to review our pages before theywere printed.andM;We asked Bitstream to comment on the problem of width compatibility.andP;  Itresponded:andM;&quot;The current ElixiForm product uses the Bitstream Fontware Installation Kitand Bitstream fonts that are not setwidth compatible with Adobe fonts, norwere they intended to be.andP;  Bitstream does offer a selection of typefaces onwidths to match Adobe fonts for use with our OEM Fontware and Speedotechnologies.andP;  Xerox/Elixir are currently working with Bitstream on asolution that will enable the ElixiForm product to provide the Bitstreamfonts that are set-width adjusted to match Adobe fonts.&quot;andM;Many vendors package Bitstream Installation Kits with their programs, andthey usually include Bitstream Swiss and Dutch fonts.andP;  These are notwidth-matched to the LaserWriter's Helvetica and Times fonts, though they arenot terribly far off.andP;  In forms work, tight spacing is the norm and errorsare quite noticeable; but width mismatches can cause problems in all kinds ofdocuments.andP;  That is why it is critical that there be a core group of fontsthat have identical widths on all systems, no matter which vendor suppliedthe fonts.andP;  We think Bitstream should move rapidly to assure that the Swissand Dutch fonts that its licensees distribute with their Installation Kitsare matched to the de facto standard.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
