 Thoseof you who missed the review can still benefit from this update, but keep inmind that it discusses only one of the many Informix products.andM;Under the heading of future products, the review quoted Carol Frost, InformixProduct Marketing Specialist for DOS, as saying that the Rapid DevelopmentSystem and Interactive Debugger would allow quicker development and testing,source level debugging, and portable applications without recompilation.andP;  Mytests showed that all these promises came true, and that three of the fourmajor objections to Informix-4GL discussed in the review have also beenovercome by the Rapid Development System.andM;What's new and what's notandM;Informix-4GL Rapid Development System and Interactive Debugger is not a newversion of an existing product; it's a brand new product.andP;  The traditional4GL product is still available under the new moniker, Informix-4GL C CompilerVersion.andP;  The primary difference between the two is that the RapidDevelopment System is a pseudo-compiler with built-in debugging capabilities(the Interactive Debugger), while the C Compiler Version is a translator thatproduces C source code that must be compiled to machine code with MicrosoftC.andM;Both use the same 4GL, (so the applications are compatible) and both use thesame database engine.andP;  Both products now support up to 15M of extended memoryand protected-mode execution of the database engine and/or your applicationon a 286 or 386 computer.andP;  Also new to Informix-4GL is DBLINK, a utilityprogram that can read data directly from Lotus 1-2-3 worksheets and dBASEII/III files and write data directly to 1-2-3 worksheets.andP;  (DBLINK and theextended memory capabilities have also been added to Informix-SQL).andP;  There'salso a new manual for the Interactive Debugger.andM;Why the Rapid DevelopmentandM;System is necessaryandM;There are a number of advantages that the Informix-4GL Rapid DevelopmentSystem and Interactive Debugger has over the C Compiler Version.andP;  As you'llsee later in this article, compiling 4GL programs is much faster and thecompiled size is significantly smaller.andP;  High level debugging, non-existentin the C Compiler Version, is superb.andP;  (To be fair, C Compiler 4GLapplications can be debugged with third party products, but the code that yousee in the debugger doesn't look anything like your source code.)andP;  Compiledapplications are portable to other platforms without recompilation (meaningthat only a half-price run-time version of Informix-4GL is required on thetarget system) and a C compiler isn't required.andM;There are a few drawbacks though.andP;  The target system must have a full orrun-time version of Informix-4GL Rapid Development System.andP;  With the CCompiler Version, Informix-4GL isn't needed on the target system if it hasInformix-SQL.andP;  There's also the possibility of slower execution for sometypes of applications, although I didn't try to measure it.andM;But I think the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages, and the C CompilerVersion will go the way of the dinosaur, at least during the developmentprocess.andP;  Since the two versions of Informix-4GL are source code compatible,the programmer can use the Rapid Development System for maximum productivityand use the C Compiler Version when the application is completed (if you needthe extra speed or independence from the Rapid Development System).andP;  Now,let's look at what the word rapid means to productivity.andM;The Rapid DevelopmentandM;SystemandM;In my original Informix review, I tested the Informix-4GL C Compiler Versionon an XT clone using the Hello program and the Useful program.andP;  The Helloprogram prints the words &quot;hello, world&quot; to test compilation speed andexecutable application size for the smallest possible case.andP;  The Usefulprogram contains a menu, a data entry form, and a report on a single databasetable.andP;  It represents the smallest realistic application that a developermight build.andP;  The results were: Compile  File Time  Size (mins)  (bytes)Hello 2:19  143,232 Useful 5:34  163,966andM;This time, I tested the C Compiler Version and Rapid Development System on a12-MHz AT clone with a fast hard-disk drive (25 ms average seek time), usingonly standard memory, and got the following results:andM;As you can see, the results from the two Informix-4GL products are strikinglydifferent.andP;  The Rapid Development System is faster than the C CompilerVersion.andP;  And you know how disruptive and frustrating it can be to deal withcompile times that run to multiple minutes.andP;  For that reason alone, the RapidDevelopment System should be popular.andM;The Interactive DebuggerandM;Whereas the Rapid Development System is a new approach to using thetraditional Informix 4GL, the Interactive Debugger is an entirely newfeature.andP;  It gives you a powerful tool for monitoring the run-time activityof your Informix-4GL applications, and it succeeds admirably.andM;The Interactive Debugger is called from the Rapid Development System's Modulemenu and the first thing it asks is which program to run.andP;  The split Debuggerscreen then appears with the source code in the upper Source window and thecursor positioned in the lower Command window.andP;  The View command moves thecursor to the Source window while scrolling through the code and the breakkey moves the cursor back down to the Command window.andP;  Ctrl-T toggles thedisplay between the split-screen and the Application screen where programinteraction occurs.andP;  Fig.andP;  1 shows a simple example of setting a breakpoint,running the Useful program, and interrogating a variable.andP;  There are alsocommands that display the definition of variables, assign values tovariables, remove breakpoints, set and remove tracepoints (for monitoringwhen a statement of function executes or when the value of a variablechanges), step execution, dump all local variables, and call a function.andM;As Fig.andP;  1 shows, monitoring the Useful program is easy with the InteractiveDebugger.andP;  The Break command sets a breakpoint at source line 45.andP;  The Runcommand starts the program.andP;  After the user selects Report from the menu,execution stops as the first row prints.andP;  The Continue command resumesexecution and the program stops on the second row.andP;  The Print command showsthe value of the lastname variable in the r_people record.andM;Prior objections reviewedandM;As I've mentioned, the Rapid Development System overcomes three of the fourobjections I raised to Informix-4GL in my review.andP;  Let's take a look at them:andM;1.andP;  Microsoft C required.andP;  Since the Rapid Development System compiles topseudo-code, Microsoft C is no longer needed.andP;  This saves installing andmanaging two software tools.andM;2.andP;  Lengthy compiles.andP;  Compile time has been cut by roughly a factor of 10.andO;This makes working with Informix-4GL much more productive.andM;3.andP;  Large executable files.andP;  The size of the pseudo-code application files issmaller than the size of the EXE files, and compiled application files areportable between different hardware platforms.andP;  There's a tradeoff though,since the Rapid Development System is now required on the target platform andapplications may run slower than before.andM;4.andP;  No visual design tools.andP;  No change here, which is unfortunate becausescreen painters for forms and reports can expand the audience of the 4GL tonon-programmers.andM;The botton lineandM;The Rapid Development System and Interactive Debugger has the potential tomake Informix-4GL much more popular because of the programming productivityit offers and the portability of the pseudo-code application files.andP;  Anattractive addition would be the C Compiler Version (to give the developerthe option of compiling to machine code without having to buy anotherInformix product).andP;  Size is one reason for having separate products though.andO;At four boxed manuals and 16 360K disks, the Rapid Development System andInteractive Debugger distribution package is already very large.andP;  The CCompiler Version is distributed on eight disks.andM;I enjoyed working with the Rapid Development System and found the InteractiveDebugger to be useful and well-integrated.andP;  Informix-4GL is an exceptionallyrich language that can be used to develop a wider variety of applicationsthan many other 4GLs.andP;  The extended memory and protected-mode support putsInformix into the same league as Oracle by allowing larger applications.andP;  Ifyou're looking for a single-user or LAN-based 4GL for your high-end PCdatabase applications, give Informix a serious look.andM;AvailabilityandM;Informix-4GL Rapid Development System and Interactive Debugger costs $1,495.andO;A half-price run-time-only version is available.andP;  Until February 28, 1989,Informix is selling a $395 developer bundle of Informix-4GL Rapid DevelopmentSystem and Interactive Debugger and Informix-SQL for MS-DOS under the productname SQL Developer Series.andP;  Informix products are not copy protected.andM;Informix is sold by Informix Software, Inc., 4100 Bohannon Drive, Menlo Park,Calif., 94205, phone (415) 322-4100.andM;Steve Roti is the owner of Olympic Software, a database consulting firmlocated in Portland, Oregon.andP;  He uses and writes about SQL relational DBMSsand 4GLs.andP;  He can be reached at (503) 284-0998.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
