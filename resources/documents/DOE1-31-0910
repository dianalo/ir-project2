Allof these countries have been visited by members of the research team,with the exception of Pakistan. Running through all the case-historiesis the importance of defining a clear market for the gas. In some casesthis can prove remarkably difficult, especially when the oil price isrelatively low. In other cases a market does exist, but is very limitedin relation to the size of available reserves. The other theme whichrecurs over and over again is the importance of the relationship betweenthe government and its agencies, and the foreign oil companies whichare involved in exploration and development of gas reserves. These twoissues are addressed in detail in each case study. But it is also thecase that each country highlights specific aspects of the gas story.</TEXT></DOC>
