The proportion of fructosein the total fructan thus shifts towards glucose. This reduction on thefructose/glucose ratio is undesirable if the intention is to obtain asweetener of high fructose content. In this work an attempt was made,via the quantity of fructose formed after a 4(3)-hour reaction of a tuber(root) extract with inulin, to assign a characteristic value to the depolymerizationtendency of the material in question. However, since the plant extractnot only contains enzymes (hydrolase A and B) that shorten the fructanchains but the activity of fructosyltransferase (SST, FFT) and enzymesof microbial origin (inulinase II, invertase) must also be considered,the concept of 'hydrolase activity' used by the authors is essentiallyan expression of 'total activity'. The activity unit (EU) is definedas the ability to split of 1 {mu}mol of fructose from (chicory) inulinper minute under experimental conditions. Values of 0.25 to 0.77 EU/gdry solids were found in Jerusalem artichoke. Considerable differencesmay occur between varieties from the same cultivated area and the sameharvest period. With one and the same variety, the activity appears tobe subject to marked yearly fluctuations, so that at present, becauseof hydrolase activity, nothing certain can be said about the depolymerizationtendency of a variety.</TEXT></DOC>
