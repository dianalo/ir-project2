A second channel is formed from a refuelingopening vapor outlet port of the fuel tank to the canister with a firstthree-way changeover electromagnetic valve disposed therein. A purgechannel is formed from a purge port of the canister to a suction systemof an engine with a second three-way changeover electromagnetic valvedisposed therein, wherein the first electromagnetic value is designedto provide communication between the canister and the channel on theside of the refueling opening vapor outlet port during the shut-downstate of the engine and, during the operation of the engine, close thechannel on the side of the refueling opening vapor outlet port whileopening the channel on the side of the canister to the atmosphere. Thesecond three-way changeover electromagnetic valve is designed to openthe channel on the side of the canister to the atmosphere during theshut-down state of the engine and provide communication between the channelon the side of the canister and the suction system of the engine duringthe operation of the engine.</TEXT></DOC>
