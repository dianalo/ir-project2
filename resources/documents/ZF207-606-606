Navy.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Navy Sets Own WORM Standards for Data StorageandM;The move to the much-touted paperless ship will be easier as the Navy adoptsde facto write once/read-many (WORM) optical media standards.andM;The Navy's Publishing and Printing Service (NPPS) will convert up to 40million engineering drawings and pages in a Computer-Aided Acquisition andLogistics Support (CALS) compliant digital format and store the data onoptical disks, the Navy's John J. Karpovich said.andP;  Karpovich is specialassistant to the director of technology for NPPS.andM;A $9.25 million contract with Docucon Inc., San Antonio, Texas, awarded in1987 and running through mid-1990, includes a &quot;shopping list of scanning andmultimedia input and output&quot; requirements, Karpovich said.andM;In the fall, NPPS will advertise the conversion contract and expand it intothe $25 million range, Karpovich said.andM;Docucon has scanned 1 million engineering drawings and 500,000 military specsand standards and is now converting 1 million pages of technical manuals, hesaid.andM;The company will convert the documents to ASCII with SGML tags, said AllanHobgood, Docucon's vice president of marketing.andP;  It will scan raster data andstore it in separate files.andM;The company uses optical drives from Pioneer Communications of America, LaserMagnetic Storage International Co., Hitachi America Ltd., Sony Corp. ofAmerica and Eastman Kodak Co.andM;The conversion system is on a token-ring network and uses several types ofhighspeed, industrial-grade scanning equipment and indexing software, Hobgoodsaid.andM;The conversion is done at Docucon and data is stored on 5-1/4-inch, 12-inchand 14-inch WORM optical disks, Karpovich said.andP;  The variety of media sizedis a result of a lack of WORM standards.andM;However, the Navy will establish a de facto optical standard under the NavyEngineering Data Management Information Control System contract awarded lastJune, Karpovich said.andP;  The Navy will standardize on the 14-inch media forlarge repositories of data.andM;The Standard Desktop Companion contract to Desktop II, the contract throughwhich the Navy bought more than 130,000 Zenith Data Systems Z-248s, willestablish a de facto 5-1/4-inch optical format.andM;The Desktop Companion contract, expected in September, will make available CDplayers, WORM drives, laser printers, upgrades from the Intel Corp. 80286chip to the 80386 and desktop publishing software, Karpovich said.andM;The contract will help solve the Navy's optical chicken-and-egg dilemma,Karpovich said.andP;  Users have been reluctant to buy optical technology until arange of applications were available.andP;  But many applications will not bedeveloped until a large base of the technology is installed.andM;The Navy is considering buying 5-1/4-inch optical jukeboxes, but it has notyet developed a contract.andP;  &quot;Although multidrive configurations can getunwieldy, we've had a problem with jukeboxes being too slow,&quot; Karpovich said.andM;The Navy has stored paper documents and drawings in Philadelphia, and atleast initially, data on optical disks will be at the site, Karpovich said.andM;A recently formalized Naval Sea Systems policy requires that, starting inOctober, every technical manual reprinted be scanned, Karpovich said.andP;  Theservice has run pilot projects for the paperless ship for about 18 months toprove the concept of keeping information in digital form, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
