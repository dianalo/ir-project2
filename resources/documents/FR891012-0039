Hazardous liquid is defined to include petroleum,petroleum products, or anhydrous ammonia. Therefore, part 195 does notcurrently apply to the transportation of carbon dioxide (CO<T2>2</T2>) by pipeline.Physical Properties of CO<T2>2</T2>At normal temperatures and atmospheric pressure, CO<T2>2</T2> is an odorless and colorless gas, not flammable, with a density1.5 times the density of air. It will not support combustion nor will itsustain life if inhaled.Carbon dioxide may exist simultaneously as a gas, liquid, and solid atits triple point which is ^69 anddegrees;F and 60.43 psig. Below the triplepoint, it may be either a solid or gas depending on temperature and pressure.Dry ice for refrigeration is a common use of CO<T2>2</T2> in solid form. Dry ice at a temperature of ^109 anddegrees;F andatmospheric pressure will sublime, that is, pass to the gas phase withoutgoing through the liquid state. The critical temperature of CO<T2>2</T2> is 87.8 anddegrees;F. When pressure reaches 1,200 psig, CO<T2>2</T2> enters what is called the supercritical phase (also referredto as a dense vapor phase). Pipeline transportation in the supercriticalphase is more desirable than transportation in the gaseous phase.Carbon dioxide as a gas is considered to be inert and does not easily reactwith other gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide's chemical reactionwith water is most significant in pipeline transportation, since it formscarbonic acid, which has a pH of 3 and is corrosive to metals, includingsteel pipe, valves, and fittings. Because of this chemical reaction, itis essential that a CO<T2>2</T2> pipeline be dried out completely after a hydrostatic test.Carbon Dioxide PipelinesGases have been used for many years to aid in the production of crude oil.They were initially used as a cap on the oil, injected into oil reservoirsto slow down the pressure decline from production. The displacement duringproduction of crude oil by these gases was principally of the immiscible(not capable of mixing) type.Research in the 1950s and 1960s was conducted into the use of gas whichwould mix with the crude oil and displace it in the formation. Becauseof its high degree of solubility in crude oil and abundance from naturalsources, CO<T2>2</T2> became a natural candidate for use in enhanced oil recovery(EOR) projects. Carbon dioxide extracts crude oil from the formation. Under favorable conditionsof pressure, temperature, and composition, the CO<T2>2</T2> mixes with the crude oil. The CO<T2>2</T2> that dissolves in the crude oil increases the volume and decreasesthe viscosity making the oil more mobile. It also exerts an acidic effecton some types of reservoir rocks and vaporizes some of the oil. There are a number of sources of CO<T2>2</T2> for EOR projects. It can be produced commercially in naturalgas plants, ammonia plants, and recovered from power plant stack gas. Thesesources generally require a considerable amount of energy to compress CO<T2>2</T2> for introduction into a pipeline. A better source is from undergoundreservoirs where CO<T2>2</T2> under pressure occurs naturally. The reported location and sizeof the largest such reservoirs are presented in Table 1. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s20,r20,8 </C><T4>Table </T4>1.<T4>_CO</T4><T2>2</T2> <T4>Fields in the U.S. and Their Reserves </T4>1987 <H1>Field </H1><H1>Location (state) </H1><H1>Proven reserves (TCF)</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Jackson Dome <D>Mississippi </D><D>3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Paradox Basin <D>Utah </D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Farnam Dome <D>Utah </D><D>1.5-2.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">LaBarge-Big Piney <D>Wyoming </D><D>20-55 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Doe Canyon/McElmo Dome <D>Colorado </D><D>10-12 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sheep Mountain <D>Colorado </D><D>1-2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bravo Dome <D>New Mexico </D><D>6-8</D></ITAG></ITAG> There are various modes of transportation for CO<T2>2</T2>, but for the large volumes required in EOR projects, pipelinetransportation is the most reliable and economical. A paper by Dwight L.Recht titled ``Carbon Dioxide Pipeline Design Considerations'' presentedat Interpipe 85 in Houston, Texas, in 1985 describes the design of pipelinesfor transporting CO<T2>2</T2>. The most significant points concerning the design of CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines are: andbullet; Pipeline transportation in the supercritical phase (where pressureexceeds 1,200 psig at any temperature) is more desirable than transportationin the gaseous phase. When transporting CO<T2>2</T2> in the gaseous phase at pressures above 700 psig in winter conditions,two-phase flow may occur, resulting in excessive pressure losses in hillyterrain and requiring the installation of expensive liquid separation equipmentat booster stations. andbullet; The pressure at which CO<T2>2</T2> will mix with crude oil (its miscibility pressure) can be ashigh as 3,000 psig, necessitating very high design pressures for pipelines.andbullet; To minimize the formation of carbonic acid, CO<T2>2</T2> gas should be dehydrated to a water dewpoint below the minimumCO<T2>2</T2> service temperature.andbullet; Temperature variations during pipeline transportation producenonlinear fluctuations in hydraulic characteristics of the CO<T2>2</T2>, requiring design by short sections, particularly in hill terrain.andbullet; Supercompressibility must be considered in design, even in thesupercritical phase. This results in negligible pressure surges causedby valve closings or the starting/shutdown of pumps. andbullet; The refrigeration effects when pressures are reduced from 1200psig or higher to atmospheric during initial fill of a pipeline or duringblow down during operation results in very low temperatures so that steelpipe and components must be chosen with suitable properties to preventbrittle fracture failures. The discussion above indicates that CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines require certain special design considerations in additionto those used for most natural gas or hazardous liquid pipelines that theDepartment currently regulates. Table 2 lists a summary of existing CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s100,r100,7,16,r100 </C><T4>Table </T4>2<T4>_Summary of Existing CO</T4><T2>2</T2> <T4>Pipelines </T4><H1>Pipeline </H1><H1>Operator </H1><H1>Length (miles) </H1><H1>Diameter (inch) </H1><H1>Location</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cortez Pipeline Co. <D>Shell Pipeline Corp. </D><D>500 </D><D>30 </D><D>Colorado to Texas. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bravo Pipeline Co. <D>Amoco Pipeline </D><D>218 </D><D>20 </D><D>New Mexico to Texas. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sheep Mt.

An exception is the Choctaw Pipeline whichoriginates near Jackson, Mississippi, and terminates near McComb, Mississippi.Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act of 1988There have been Congressional concerns regarding the transportation ofCO<T2>2</T2> by pipeline over a number of years. The report on the PipelineSafety Reauthorization Act of 1988 from the House Committee on Energy andCommerce in the 1987 session of the 100th Congress points out that  ``** * The Committee has for sometime recommended the safety regulation andinspection of CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines.'' The Committee further notes that:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * The CO<T2>2</T2> pipeline industry has a good safety record and performs an essentialservice for enhanced oil recovery, but it is a very new industry. It isnot a question of its safety record that caused the requirement for safetyregulation, but rather the unique potential for disaster if there wereever a break in a CO<T2>2</T2> pipeline.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Despite its pervasive nature and absolute necessity to life, CO<T2>2</T2> has the potential to be as lethal as any other gas when it ispresent in concentrations greater than 10 percent. This could happen ifa CO<T2>2</T2> pipeline ruptured. Water is equally benign, but in a flood itcan kill. CO<T2>2</T2> is similar; in concentrations over 10% it is deadly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The industry suggested that since they have a good safety record,they do not need safety inspection under the HLPSA or any other appropriatestatute. When DOT asked for industry comments on the need for CO<T2>2</T2> safety regulations, a typical industry comment was, ``CO<T2>2</T2> is not a toxic substance * * *.'' By strict definition, thisis correct; CO<T2>2</T2> is not toxic substance. Rather CO<T2>2</T2> causes death by asphyxiation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A recent event demonstrated just how lethal CO<T2>2</T2> can be. On August 21, 1986, a catastrophic release on gas dissolvedin Lake Nyos in Cameroon, Africa, killed 1,700 people. At the time, thenews media characterized the gas as ``toxic,'' ``poisonous'' and ``lethal.''Subsequent investigation proved the gas was carbon dioxide.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As far as the source of the carbon dioxide is concerned, the LakeNyos incident bears no relation to a pipeline. The CO<T2>2</T2> in Lake Nyos was derived from volcanic sources. The result ofthis CO<T2>2</T2> release from the lake could be similar to the results if a CO<T2>2</T2> line under 3000 psi were to rupture. The quantity of CO<T2>2</T2> released at Lake Nyos, however, was approximately eight timesgreater than the volume would be released from any existing pipeline.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Committee recognizes the role CO<T2>2</T2> will play in expanding the enhanced oil recovery industry. Itis for this very reason additional CO<T2>2</T2> lines are likely to be constructed. The Committee does not wantto limit the future construction of CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines because of unnecessary safety regulations. None-the-lessthe Committee believes that since CO<T2>2</T2> is deadly, CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines should have appropriate Federal safety regulations.</ITAG>The requirement to issue regulations for the pipeline transportation ofcarbon dioxide was included in section 211 of title II of the PipelineSafety Reauthorization Act of 1988. That section added section 219 to theHazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (HLPSA) (49 U.S.C. 2001 <T3>et seq.</T3>) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="63">Section 219_Carbon Dioxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) <T3>General Rule. </T3>In addition to hazardous liquids, the Secretaryshall regulate under this title carbon dioxide which is transported bypipeline facilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) <T3>Regulations. </T3>The Secretary, as necessary and appropriate, shallamend regulations issued with respect to hazardous liquids under this titleand shall issue new regulations to ensure the safe transportation of carbondioxide by pipeline facilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Proposed Revisions</ITAG>On March 16, 1989, the American Petroleum Institute (API) petitioned theDepartment to amend part 195 to include the regulation of pipelines thattransport CO<T2>2</T2>. The recommendations contained in this petition are the productof a task force formed under API auspices, consisting of representativesof nine companies that own or operate CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines. The participating companies were Amerada Hess Corporation,Amoco Pipeline Company, ARCO Pipeline Company, Chevron Pipe Line Company,Enron Corporation, Exxon Pipeline Company, Mobil Pipe Line Company, ProductionOperators, Inc., and Shell Pipe Line Corporation.The API recommended that OPS amend existing part 195 rather than attemptto write a new part for CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines only. API felt the addition of a new set of regulationsspecific to CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines would complicate matters unnecessarily for both pipelineoperators and OPS alike. OPS has adopted this approach, noting that itis consistent with the requirements of section 219(b) of the HLPSA.The API stated that the hazard of CO<T2>2</T2> is significantly different from that of hazardous liquids subjectto part 195. The term ``hazardous liquid'' is defined in part 195 as petroleum,petroleum product, or anhydrous ammonia. All of these substances are flammableor toxic or both, while CO<T2>2</T2> is not flammable, nor is it toxic. The primary hazard of CO<T2>2</T2> is the potential for asphyxiation if a high concentration ofCO<T2>2</T2> is accidentally released from a pipeline.Because of this difference in hazards, API considers it inappropriate toinclude CO<T2>2</T2> as another substance under the definition of ``hazardous liquid.''API argued that the two terms should not be confused to prevent the possibilityof indiscriminate future application to CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines of regulations suited for hazardous liquid pipelines,and vice versa. OPS has no good reason to dispute this notion, especiallysince Congress distinguished the terms in the Reauthorization Act. Thus,part 195 would be applied to CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines without calling CO<T2>2</T2> a hazardous liquid.API recognized that some of the requirements in part 195 are not appropriatefor CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines. OPS agrees that CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines need to be exempt from certain parts of the existingregulations. In other instances new regulations need to be applied to CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines, but not to the other pipelines regulated under part195. In addition, revisions have been proposed to those sections that needto be amended to make those regulations compatible with the pipeline transportationof CO<T2>2</T2>.The following is a discussion of the proposed changes to part 195:TitleAPI's petition suggested that the title be changed to ``Transportationof Hazardous Liquids and Carbon Dioxide by Pipeline.'' While OPS agreesthat carbon dioxide should not be included in the definition of ``hazardousliquids,'' the current title of part 195 would not be amended to includeCO<T2>2</T2>, because it would result in an awkward title. Similarly, Congressdid not see fit to change the title of the statute which authorizes theregulation of CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines; it remains ``Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Actof 1979.''<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart A_General</ITAG>Section 195.0 GeneralThis section would be amended to make part 195 applicable to the transportationof carbon dioxide by pipeline.Section 195.1 ApplicabilitySection 195.1(a) would be amended to state that part 195 applies to thepipeline transportation of CO<T2>2</T2> in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce (covering bothinterstate pipelines and intrastate pipelines), with the exceptions notedbelow.Section 195.1(b)(5) would be revised to exclude from regulation the transportationof CO<T2>2</T2> in offshore pipelines that are located upstream from the outletflange of each facility on the Outer Continental Shelf where carbon dioxideis produced. This change is consistent with the existing jurisdictionallimit of part 195 regarding offshore pipelines under the jurisdiction ofthe Department of the Interior.Sections 195.1(b) (6) and (7) would be revised to exclude from regulationtransportation of CO<T2>2</T2> through onshore production, refining, and manufacturing facilities,and transportation by modes of transit other than pipelines. Again, thisis consistent with the jurisdictional limits of the HLPSA.The exemption under andSection; 195.1(b)(6) would exclude from the regulationsCO<T2>2</T2> production facilities over reservoirs and other facilities whereCO<T2>2</T2> is produced. In these facilities carbon dioxide is preparedfor pipeline transportation by removal of water, methane, and other hydrocarbonsor elements. This is similar to the exemption that currently applies topetroleum production facilities and other facilities used in the productionof hazardous liquids. Also, excluded under this section would be CO<T2>2</T2> recycling systems. These are used to reprocess CO<T2>2</T2> after injection into a petroleum reservoir. They are more inthe nature of a petroleum production facility than CO<T2>2</T2> pipeline transportation.A proposed andSection; 195.1(b)(8) would exclude from regulation the transportationof carbon dioxide through CO<T2>2</T2> distribution systems in petroleum production fields. This exemptionwould apply downstream from the first flange, or other connection, wherecarbon dioxide is delivered to a CO<T2>2</T2> distribution system. The CO<T2>2</T2> pipeline facilities that would be included in this exemptiontypically are located in rural areas away from the general public. TheHLPSA exempts onshore petroleum production facilities from regulation,and since CO<T2>2</T2> distribution lines in a petroleum production field are closelyinvolved with petroleum production, OPS believes the CO<T2>2</T2> distribution systems are exempt from regulation under this statutoryprovision.Section 195.2 Definitions``<T3>Carbon dioxide</T3>'' has been defined to provide a means of distinguishingfacilities that transport this fluid from facilities that transport hazardousliquids.The definition of ``production facility'' would be changed to include pipingor equipment used in the production, extraction, recovery, lifting, stabilization,separation or treating of carbon dioxide, or associated storage or measurement.The revision is needed in order to include those facilities used in theprocess of extracting carbon dioxide from the ground and preparing it fortransportation by pipeline. A provision would be added to specificallyinclude piping between treatment plants that extract carbon dioxide, andfacilities utilized for the injection of carbon dioxide for recovery operations.In addition to the revision to the definition of ``production facility,''``carbon dioxide'' has been added to the definitions of ``interstate pipeline,''``pipe,'' ``pipeline,'' and ``pipeline facility'' to assure that theseterms include carbon dioxide as a necessary component of those definitions.Section 195.4 Compatibility Necessary for Transportation of Hazardous Liquidsor Carbon DioxideIt is important to recognize the importance of the chemical compatibilityof carbon dioxide to the pipeline system in which it is being transported.OPS believes the inclusion of carbon dioxide in this paragraph and andSection;195.418, Internal corrosion control, would address any corrosivity questionsproperly. This paragraph would require that carbon dioxide be chemicallycompatible with the pipeline, including all components, and any other commoditywith which it may come into contact.Section 195.8 Transportation of Hazardous Liquids or Carbon Dioxide inPipelines Constructed With Other Than Steel PipeThis proposed revision would require that the Department be notified beforeoperators transport carbon dioxide in pipelines constructed of materialother than steel.<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart B_Reporting Accidents and Safety-Related Conditions</ITAG>Section195.50 Reporting AccidentsAccident and safety-related condition reporting for carbon dioxide pipelineswould be subject to the same criteria that apply to non-HVL hazardous liquids.An appropriate change would be made to andSection; 195.52 to require thetelephonic reporting of certain carbon dioxide releases. Report Form 7000-1,or a facsimile, would be used for reporting CO<T2>2</T2> pipeline accidents, even though the title of the form bearsthe name hazardous liquid pipelines.<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart C_Design Requirements</ITAG>Section 195.102 Design TemperatureLow temperatures produced by pressure reduction situations or during theinitial fill of the pipeline are important considerations when designinga carbon dioxide pipeline. OPS believes the language of existing andSection;195.102 should be revised to assure that materials for carbon dioxide arechosen properly for the low temperatures encountered during these situations.The proposed revision is not limited to problems that may arise from thecold nature of carbon dioxide, but recognizes that other commodities mayalso expose the pipeline to similar problems.Section 195.111 Fracture PropagationA new section is proposed to be added to account for the potential problemof a propagating fracture in a carbon dioxide pipeline. Because they operateat such high pressures, CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines contain a great amount of stored energy, much morethan in a gas transmission pipeline. Performance language has been chosenfor this new requirement to allow the operator of the pipeline system todetermine the best method to mitigate a propagating fracture. Availablemethods include installation of heavy walled pipe or a mechanical deviceon the exterior of the pipe wall. It should be noted that some carbon dioxidepipelines with line pipe of adequate toughness may not require any additionalspecial methods.Section 195.116 ValvesMaterial compatibility of pipeline components and the commodity being transportedis always a concern of an operator, regardless of the commodity involved.The proposed addition of carbon dioxide to the scope of this section wouldclearly indicate this concern for carbon dioxide pipelines.<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart D_Construction</ITAG>API thought that due to the nonpolluting nature of carbon dioxide, valveslocated on either side of a water crossing should not be required. TheOPS does not agree. While CO<T2>2</T2> may not be of a polluting nature, carbon dioxide bubbling throughwater can result in an asphyxiating cloud formation if carbon dioxide isreleased in large quantities as shown by the release of carbon dioxidein Lake Nyos in Cameroon, Africa. While it appears that a pipeline couldnot release sufficient quantities of carbon dioxide under a water crossingto create a problem, there is insufficient evidence to determine the quantityof a carbon dioxide release that would result in an unsafe condition. TheOPS believes that placing valves on each side of a water crossing thatis more than 100-feet wide is not an onerous requirement. Some currentcarbon dioxide pipelines have been constructed with valves on each sideof major water crossings. If an operator finds this requirement to be significantlyburdensome because the pipeline is located in swamps or crosses numeroustimes in meandering streams, the operator can petition for a finding thatvalves are not justified (an option that is available under andSection; 195.260(e),and has been used by operators of hazardous liquid pipelines).<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart E_Hydrostatic Testing</ITAG>Section 195.306 Test MediumThis section is proposed to be revised to allow inert gas or carbon dioxideto be used as a test medium instead of water in carbon dioxide pipelines.This is desirable to reduce the potential for internal corrosion problemscaused by the mixing of water and carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid.The use of inert gas or carbon dioxide offers particular advantages tofacilities that have areas that are difficult to dry, such as meter stationswith several branch connections or fittings.<ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart F_Operation and Maintenance</ITAG>Section 195.401 General RequirementsRevisions are proposed to distinguish between hazardous liquid pipelinesand carbon dioxide pipelines regarding the applicability dates of the designand construction requirements.Section 195.402 Procedural Manual for Operations, Maintenance, and EmergenciesRevisions are proposed to include carbon dioxide pipelines in the requirementsfor a procedural manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies.Section 195.403 TrainingRevisions are proposed to include carbon dioxide pipelines in the requirementsfor establishing and conducting a continuing training program.Section 195.410 Line MarkersThe term ``carbon dioxide pipeline'' is proposed for use in carbon dioxidepipeline markers.Section 195.414 Cathodic ProtectionThe proposed revisions would require that carbon dioxide pipelines be cathodicallyprotected similarly to hazardous liquid pipelines. Carbon dioxide pipelinesmust be protected against corrosion to assure the integrity of the pipeline.However, the proposed rules require that the carbon dioxide pipelines becathodically protected in a shorter period than was provided for the hazardousliquid pipelines because most of the existing CO<T2>2</T2> pipelines are already cathodically protected.Section 195.418 Internal Corrosion ControlCarbon dioxide pipelines have a unique internal corrosion potential. Watercan combine with carbon dioxide to form a compound that may be corrosiveunder pipeline operating conditions. The addition of the words ``carbondioxide'' to this paragraph would require operators to investigate thiscorrosive effect and take adequate steps to mitigate such corrosion.Section 195.440 Public EducationRevisions are proposed to require CO<T2>2</T2> pipeline operators to establish a continuing education programto enable the public to recognize a carbon dioxide pipeline emergency.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This proposed rulemaking contains collection of information requirementsin andSection;andSection; 195.5(c), subpart B, 195.266, 195.310, 195.402, and195.404. These requirements will be submitted to the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980(44 U.S.C. chap. 35) and 5 CFR 1320. Persons desiring to comment on theseproposed information collection requirements should submit their commentsto: Desk Officer, Research and Special Programs Administration, Officeof Regulatory Policy, Office of Management and Budget, 726 Jackson PlaceNW., Washington, DC 20503.Persons submitting comments to OMB are also requested to submit a copyof their comments to OPS, as indicated above under <T2>ADDRESS</T2>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Impact</ITAG>The proposed rules would extend the part 195 pipeline safety regulationsto pipelines that transport CO<T2>2</T2>, which are few in number. Pipelines under construction beforethe effective date of the final rule would be subject only to the accidentreporting and operation and maintenance requirements of these regulations.Because almost all the proposals follow industry recommended practices,the fiscal impact of the proposed rules should be small. Therefore, thisproposal is considered to be nonmajor under Executive Order 12291, andis not considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). Since the proposed rule should requireminimal compliance expense, it does not warrant preparation of a DraftEvaluation. Also, based on the facts available concerning the impact ofthis proposal, I certify under section 605 of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct that it would not if adopted as final, have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. This action has beenanalyzed under the criteria of Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685) andfound not to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 195</ITAG>Carbon dioxide, Pipe, Pipeline safety.In consideration of the foregoing, OPS proposes to amend 49 CFR part 195as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 195_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
