Through the 1990s, that will translate into about a $1 ayear added to the per-barrel price of oil, Sir Peter Holmes,chairman of Shell Transport andamp; Trading, one of the two ownersof the giant Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said in an interview.</LP><TEXT>   Sir Peter conceded that prices could continue to move like&quot;a roller coaster,&quot; bouncing around within an upwardly moving$4 range. But he said the Shell Group is forecasting agenerally moderate overall trend because it believes theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will expandproduction to meet growing world demand. OPEC, whichcurrently supplies about 45% of the non-Communist world'soil, is considered pivotal to future price movements.   Recently, a number of forecasters have projected world oildemand will grow faster than production capacity, triggeringa spike that could double prices by the mid-1990s. Currentworld oil prices range from about $16 a barrel to $20 abarrel.   In taking a more conservative view, Sir Peter also citedOPEC's apparent desire to avoid a rerun of past rapid priceescalations that produced world turmoil. &quot;They don't want tosee prices run away,&quot; he said. In particular, he said,&quot;Kuwait is determined to keep prices low.&quot;   The Shell Group estimates that OPEC's largest producer,Saudi Arabia, will meet its goal of expanding dailyproduction capacity to 8.5 million to 10 million barrels fromcurrent capacity of 7.8 million. The other OPEC members withthe potential and desire to boost output -- Iran, Iraq, andthe United Arab Emirates -- also will meet their goals earlyin the 1990s, he said.   As a result, Sir Peter predicted, OPEC's daily productionwill stay at a comfortable level in relation to capacity. &quot;IfOPEC production remains at around 80% of installed capacity,it is unlikely you will see prices surge either upward ordownward,&quot; he said. In the past, when OPEC output crossed the80% threshold, he said, prices became far more volatile.   OPEC's Secretary-General Subroto has been saying that OPECwill need to spend $60 billion over the next several years toraise its capacity to meet demand for its oil. Subroto hasasked for help from international oil companies, but SirPeter doesn't think many countries will seek such outsidefinancing.   &quot;I don't think the Saudis, Kuwait or the U.A.E. will needany at all,&quot; he said. &quot;Over five years, $60 billion isn'tthat much.&quot;   Sir Peter said Iran and Iraq may need some help anddisclosed that the company has talked with Iraq officials.&quot;They have been welcoming and then less welcoming,&quot; he said.   The Shell Group sees big opportunities, however, in theSoviet Union. &quot;We're trying real hard to get in,&quot; Sir Petersaid. &quot;It will happen but I think it will be slow.&quot; He saidcurrent Soviet oil technology is outdated. &quot;They areoperating with techniques we used 30 and 40 years ago,&quot; hesaid. &quot;A couple of decades doesn't sound like much, but inour industry that's the stone age.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
