As always with Mr.Nixon, there's something a little unusual about this library.Unlike other presidential libraries, this one doesn't containMr. Nixon's official papers. Congress seized some 42 millionpages of documents and thousands of hours of tapes when Mr.Nixon left office. These remain in a Virginia warehouse.Maybe someday Congress will decide to free these hostages.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
