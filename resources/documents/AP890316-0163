Brock Evans, a vice president of the National Audubon Society,said Lujan should ``review or reconsider his remarks. I'mdisappointed and it doesn't send very good signals about PresidentBush being an environmental president.''   Lujan, in an interview with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, saidthe spotted owl dispute unfolding in the Pacific Northwest was a``prime example'' of the difficulty in balancing environmentalconcerns with economic impacts.   ``I'm told, on the one hand, that I want to protect an endangeredspecies,'' Lujan said. ``On the other hand, I hear that's going todevastate the entire Northwest lumber industry.   ``How do we solve that problem? I believe we should be able totake economic considerations into account.''   He suggested that the Endangered Species Act be amended to makeeconomic impact part of the determination process.   Under existing law, the Fish and Wildlife Service may consideronly ``biological factors'' when deciding whether to protect aspecies. The Fish and Wildlife Service is part of the InteriorDepartment.   ``Maybe we should change the law'' to consider economic factors,Lujan said.   Steven Goldstein, an Interior Department spokesman, said Thursdaythat Lujan believes that while economic impact was ``not a reason toexclude'' a species from protection, ``it is something we shouldtake into account when we are making that decision.   ``We need to factor that into the equation,'' said Goldstein.``We can't operate in a vacuum.''   The spotted owl, which nests only in the ancient forests of theNorthwest, has become the focal point of an increasingly heatedbattle over protecting old growth timber.   Environmentalists have sought to have the owl protected as anendangered species, but the timber industry has insisted that such adesignation could halt logging in vast areas of the Northwest andresult in the loss of thousands of jobs.   The Fish and Wildlife Service had previously denied a requestfrom environmentalists that the owl be listed as endangered, but afederal court in Seattle ordered the agency to review its decision.</TEXT></DOC>
