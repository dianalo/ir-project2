On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, jumped29 cents to settle at $15.61 a barrel Thursday. Other contractmonths also rose.   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, theJanuary contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.70 cent to settle at45.98 cents a gallon, while other contract months ended the daymixed. Heating oil closed up 0.94 cent at 49.18 cents a gallon, andother contracts also rose.   Analysts said fear of shorter crude oil supplies when the newOPEC accord takes effect convinced investors to add more to theirinventories.   Energy brokers said trading volume was heavy with commercialactivity particulary strong. Prices seesawed throughout the day asinvestors bought and sold futures and crude prices moved near $15.80a barrel weekly high reached Monday after the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries signed a new accord to reduce itsoutput by some 4 million barrels a day next year.   Traders noted that the January contract far outsold others amidexpectations that oil supplies could be sharply curtailed if OPECacts on its agreement.   Helping to boost prices was ongoing speculation that severalnon-OPEC oil producing nations would take an active role in helpingthe cartel shrink the world oil glut.   ``There was talk that eight producers from non-OPEC countrieswould meet to discuss this,'' said Linda Simard, oil broker withDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   Mexico, Oman, Malaysia and Norway are among the non-OPEC nationsthat have indicated an interest in reducing their own output,analysts said.</TEXT></DOC>
