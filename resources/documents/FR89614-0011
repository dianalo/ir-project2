Introduction The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is issuing an interimrule revising the formula used to compute the monthly carrying charge ratefor Account No. 191 carrying charges required in the Commission's PurchasedGas Adjustment (PGA) filings.\1\<NOTE/> Under the revised regulations, the daily interest rate tobe determined in the second step of the carrying charges formula in andSection;154.305(h)(4) of the Commission's regulations must be expressed to thenearest one ten-thousandth of one percent (<T3>i.e., </T3>rounded to the sixth decimal place). The Commission's regulationscurrently require the daily interest rate to be expressed to the nearestone one-hundredth of one percent (<T3>i.e., </T3>rounded to the fourth decimal place). The Commission isamending its regulations in this interim rule while, at the same time,seeking comments on the change. After reviewing the comments, the Commissionwill issue a final rule in this proceeding. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 154.305(h) (1988). II. Background The Commission permits natural gas pipeline companies to recover changesin the cost of purchased natural gas through a purchased gas adjustmentclause proceeding as an alternative to recovering these costs in a generalrate proceeding pursuant to section 4 of the Natural Gas Act.\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 15 U.S.C. 717(c) (1982). The procedures for recoveringpurchased gas costs in an NGA section 4 general rate proceedings are providedin andSection; 154.63 of the Commission's regulations. <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 154.63 (1988). The Commission's current PGA regulations \3\<NOTE/> require a natural gas pipeline company to determine its overrecoveredor underrecovered purchased gas costs each month and to either credit ordebit these amounts to Account No. 191 of the Uniform System of Accounts.\4\<NOTE/> Additionally, the Commission's regulations require a pipelineto compute carrying charges on the pipeline's Account No. 191 balances.\5\<NOTE/> According to the Commission's regulations, a pipeline mustcompute the monthly carrying charge by multiplying the carrying chargerate specified in andSection; 154.305(h)(4) by the carrying charge base specifiedin andSection; 154.305(h)(3). The pipeline's carrying charge base is calculatedfor the refunds, revenue credits or billing adjustments subaccount anda separate carrying charge base is calculated for all other subaccountsin Account No. 191. Under andSection; 154.305(h)(4), the pipeline's monthlycarrying charge rate is calculated by dividing the annualized quarterlyrate provided for in andSection; 154.67(c)(2)(iii)(A) of the Commission'sregulations by the number of days in the year, and then multiplying theresult by the number of days in the applicable month. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Revisions to the Purchased Gas Adjustment Regulations,Order No. 483, 52 FR 43,854 (Nov. 17, 1987); III FERC Stats. and Regs.andpara; 30,778 (Nov. 10, 1987); 52 FR 48,407 (Dec. 22, 1987); III FERC Stats.and Regs. andpara; 30,785 (Dec. 16, 1987); 53 FR 3364 (Feb. 5, 1988); IIIFERC Stats and Regs. andpara; 30,796 (Jan. 29, 1988); <T3>reh'q, </T3>53 FR 7495 (Mar. 9, 1988), III FERC Stats. and Regs. andpara;30,798 (Mar. 2, 1988); 53 FR 11,991 (Apr. 12, 1988), III FERC Stats. andRegs. andpara; 30,802 (Apr. 6, 1988); 53 FR 12,676 (Apr. 18, 1988): III FERCStats. and Regs. andpara; 30,803 (Apr. 12, 1988); 53 FR 13,254 (Apr. 22,1988) III FERC Stats. and Regs. andpara; 30,806 (Apr. 18, 1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 18 CFR Part 201 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 18 CFR 154.305(h) (1988). The Commission's current PGA regulations specifically require that eachresult in the formula for determining the carrying charge rate must beexpressed to the nearest one one-hundredth of one percent, <T3>i.e., </T3>rounded to the fourth decimal place.\6\<NOTE/> The Commission added this specific requirement in its currentPGA regulations to ensure that pipelines compute their interest rate factorsfor carrying charges in the same manner.\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 154.305(h)(4) (ii) and (iii) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Prior to Order No. 483 establishing the Commission's currentPGA regulations, pipelines would start with the average prime rate foreach calendar quarter and then use their own computation to arrive at themonthly interest rate factor. For example, a pipeline might take the annualquarterly interest rate and divide it by either twelve or 365 to determinea daily interest rate. The pipeline would then round the daily interestrate to whatever decimal place the pipeline preferred. Finally, the pipelinewould multiply the daily interest rate by the number of days in the month,expressed to one one-hundredth of one percent, to arrive at the monthlyinterest rate. Recently, the Commission has granted several pipelines a limited waiverof the carrying charges formula in andSection; 154.305(h)(4) to permit themto express the daily interest rate calculated under andSection; 154.305(h)(4)(ii),the second step of the carrying charges formula, to the nearest one ten-thousandthof one percent.\8\<NOTE/> The Commission granted these waivers because a Commissionstaff study found that expressing the daily interest rate in the secondstep of the carrying charges formula to the nearest one one-hundredth ofone percent creates variances between the de facto annual rate used tocompute carrying charges on a pipeline's Account No. 191 balance and theannual rate used to calculate refunds for a general NGA section 4 rateproceeding according to andSection; 154.67(c)(2)(iii)(A) of the Commission'sregulations.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Algonquin Gas Transmission Co., Docket No. TA89-20-001,46 FERC andpara; 61,397 at 62,268 (Mar. 23, 1989); Alabama-Tennessee NaturalGas Company, Docket No. TA89-11-000, 46 FERC andpara; 61,429 (Mar. 31, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ 18 CFR 154.67(c)(2)(iii)(A) (1988). III. Discussion  Commission staff studied the difference between the de facto annual interestrates obtained by using four different rounding factors for the secondstep of the carrying charges formula in andSection;154.305(h)(4) and theoriginal annual interest rate calculated on refunds in accordance withandSection;154.67(c)(2)(iii)(A), while still rounding the final step in thecarrying charges formula, the monthly interest rate, to one one-hundredthof one percent, <T3>i.e., </T3>four decimal places.\1\\0\<NOTE/> The Commission's study shows that calculations expressingthe daily interest rate in the second step of the carrying charges formulain andSection;154.305(h)(4) to the sixth, eighth or float\1\\1\<NOTE/> decimal places does not create any significant variance withthe annual rate used to calculate refunds in andSection;154.67(c)(2)(iii)(A)of the Commission's regulations, but that expressing it to the fourth decimalplace does create a significant variance. In fact, the calculations forsixth, eighth or float decimal places result in similar final monthly interestrates.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\The Commission's study is attached as Appendix A.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\<T3>I.e., </T3>using no rounding factor at all.   Commission staff also prepared a worksheet highlighting the percentageof distortions or variances between the de facto annual rate used in thesecond step of the carrying charges formula on the Account No. 191 balanceand the annual rate calculated for refunds in a pipeline's latest NGA section4 rate filing pursuant to andSection;154.67(c)(2)(iii)(A) of the Commission'sregulations.\1\\2\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\<T3>See </T3>Appendix B.   The distortion in the final carrying charge interest rate on a pipeline'sAccount No. 191 balance violates the principle underlying the PGA regulationsthat the carrying charges on Account No. 191 must equal the current interestrate on pipeline refunds prescribed by the Commission in andSection;154.67(c)(2)(iii)(A)of its regulations. The PGA regulations are designed to ensure that thepiplelines and their customers are in the same financial position thatthey would have been in if there had been no delay in the recovery of theovercharges or undercharges held in a pipeline's Account No. 191.\1\\3\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\<T3>See </T3>Modification of Purchased Gas Cost Adjustment Clause Regulations,Order No. 13, 43 F.R. 50,167 (Oct. 27, 1978), FERC Stats. andamp; Regs. [RegulationsPreambles 1977-1981] andpara;30,020A (1978); and Natural Gas Policy and Procedures;Final Regulation and Request for Comments, Order No. 47, 44 F.R. 53,493(Sept. 14, 1979), FERC Stats. andamp; Regs. [Regulations Preambles 1977-1981]andpara;30,083 (Sept. 10, 1979).   The Commission is revising andSection;154.305(h)(4)(ii) of its regulationsto require that the daily interest rate must be expressed to the nearestone ten-thousandth of one percent (<T3>i.e., </T3>rounded to the sixth decimal place). This will substantiallyeliminate the distortions in the calculations, so as to ensure that thereis no significant variation between the interest rate determined underandSection;154.67(c)(2)(iii)(A) for refunds in a pipeline's NGA section 4general rate proceeding and the carrying charge rate determined under andSection;154.305(h)(4)for Account No. 191 balances in a pipeline's PGA filing. Thus, the carryingcharges calculated in pipelines' PGA filings will more accurately reflectthe financial position of the pipelines and their customers for overrecoveryand underrecovery of certain accounts.   IV. Administrative Findings and Effective Date   The Commission is revising the carrying charge rate computation formulaby amending andSection;154.305(h)(4)(ii) in an interim rule prior to providinga notice and obtaining comments, as generallly required by the AdministrativeProcedure Act (APA) for any rulemaking proceeding.\1\\4\<NOTE/> In addition to the reasons set forth above, the Commissionis invoking exceptions to this requirement in order to provide an immediategeneric remedy to pipelines, and to ensure uniform treatment of all pipelinesat the earliest date possible. It also will render unnecessary the filingof further petitions by pipelines for limited waiver of the carrying chargesformula in andSection;154.305(h)(4).   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (c) (1982).   The Commission, therefore, finds good cause to issue this rule withoutprior notice and comment. The Commission believes the public interest isbest served in this instance with the promulgation of an interim rule consistentwith the Commission's underlying principle that the carrying charge rateon Account No. 191 balances must accurately represent the interest ratecalculated for refunds in pipelines' NGA section 4 general rate filings.  This interim rule is effective June 8, 1989.   V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification   The Regulatory Flexibility Act generally requires a description and analysisof rules that will have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.\1\\5\<NOTE/> The pipelines affected by this rule are too large to be considered``small entities'' within the meaning of the Act.\1\\6\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the Commission certifies that this rule willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\5 U.S.C. 601-612 (1982).   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\The act defines a ``small entity'' as a small business,a small not-for-profit enterprise or a small governmental jurisdiction.5 U.S.C. 601(b) (1982). A ``small business'' is defined by reference tosection 3 of the Small Business Act, as an enterprise which is ``independentlyowned and operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation.''5 U.S.C. 6.32(a) (1982).   VI. National Environmental Policy Act Statement  Commission regulations require that an environmental assessment or an environmentalimpact statement must be prepared for any Commission action that may havea significant adverse effect on the human environment.\1\\7\<NOTE/> The Commission has categorically excluded certain actionsfrom this requirement as not having a significant effect on the human environment.\1\\8\<NOTE/> This rule involves the review of natural gas rate filingsand establishment of rates for the transportation and sale of natural gasunder sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act. Pursuant to andSection;380.4(a)(25)of the Commission's regulations, the establishment of such rates is categoricallyexcluded from these statements.\1\\9\<NOTE/> The Commission, therefore, will not prepare an environmentalassessment or an environmental impact statement for this rule.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\Regulations Implementing National Environmental PolicyAct, 52 F.R. 47,897 (Dec. 17, 1987); III FERC Stats. andamp; Regs. andpara;30,783(Dec. 10, 1987).   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\18 CFR 380.4 (1989).   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\18 CFR 380.4(a)(25) (1989).   VII. Paperwork ReductionAct Statement   The Paperwork Reduction Act\2\\0\<NOTE/> and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)\2\\1\<NOTE/> require that OMB approve certain information collection requirementsimposed by agency rule. This final rule does not change the informationcollection requirements approved by OMB. The rule simply changes the decimalplace that must be used in expressing the daily interest rate in andSection;154.305(h)(4)(ii),the second step of the carrying charges formula in andSection;154.305(h)(4)of the Commission's regulations. The Commission, therefore, is not requiredto notify OMB of this technical change.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\44 U.S.C. andSection;andSection;3501-3520 (1982).   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\5 CFR 1320.13 (1989).

Since 32 CFR Part 199 (DoD 6010.8-R) was reissuedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on July 1, 1986 (51 FR 24008), with a new format,all references to section numbers in this final rule are in accordancewith the new format. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background/Analysis </ITAG>Section 199.6(a)(4)(i) provided for denial of CHAMPUS payments for servicesof a provider found to have engaged in fraudulent activities against theProgram and for disqualification of the provider from participation inCHAMPUS. In regard to unnecessary and poor quality care, the regulationprovided for denial of CHAMPUS payments for services or supplies that arenot medically necessary or that fail to meet professionally recognizedstandards for health care, but was silent on the administrative authorityto exclude providers from the program for such abusive practices. Section 199.6(a)(4)(ii) authorized denial of CHAMPUS reimbursements forservices of any provider determined by the Secretary of the Departmentof Health and Human Services (DHHS) to have furnished supplies or serviceswhich were substantially in excess of the needs of individuals, or whichwere harmful to individuals, or which were of a grossly inferior quality,and where the Secretary, on the basis of such a determination, terminatedthe agreement of that provider for purposes of reimbursement under theMedicare and Medicaid programs. OCHAMPUS has remained dependent upon theDHHS determination as the basis for excluding those providers who engagein abusive practices. This weakness in the regulation has a potential forabuse under CHAMPUS since a provider could continue rendering poor qualityor unnecessary services to beneficiaries of CHAMPUS while avoiding thetermination by DHHS by not doing so under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.Also, CHAMPUS can be abused by a provider who could have avoided the terminationby DHHS simply by electing not to participate in Medicare and Medicaidprograms. We believe that once a provider has been found to have a pattern of orderingor furnishing services or supplies for a CHAMPUS beneficiary that are medicallyunnecessary, inferior, or harmful, CHAMPUS should be able to exclude sucha provider from the Program without having to rely on the DHHS. Such CHAMPUSauthority is needed to eliminate poor quality providers from the Program.We believe the regulation should define fraud and abuse under the CHAMPUSand strengthen its authority. The criminal statutes defining fraud andabuse are enforced in courts of law. This final rule provides for providerexclusion when convictions or judgments involving fraud are entered ina court of law. In addition, it establishes what is fraud or abuse underthe CHAMPUS by providing administrative definitions separate from any definitionsfound in criminal codes. This amendment adds a new section in Part 199 that prescribes necessarydefinitions, more clearly expresses the administrative authority, and providesa range of administrative responses and remedies, including exclusion,suspension, and termination from the program for health care providersfor fraud, abuse, or conflict of interest. Also, it authorizes CHAMPUSto exclude those providers who are sanctioned by other health care programs.This final rule provides that for any CHAMPUS determination to exclude,suspend, or terminate a provider, the provider be given an opportunityto submit documentary evidence and written argument against the proposedadverse action or to submit a written request to present evidence or argumentorally to a CHAMPUS official. It clarifies administrative appeal rights,provides criteria for reinstatement of a sanctioned provider, and providesother administrative guidelines. Conforming changes to other sections of Part 199 have been made to insureconsistency with the provisions of the new section.This amendment is intended to facilitate administrative elimination ofpoor quality health care providers from CHAMPUS, protect the beneficiaries,deter program violators, and control fraud and abuse. The end result willbe to minimize poor quality care and health risks for CHAMPUS beneficiariesand to reduce unnecessary costs to the Government. The strengthened regulationwill allow more aggressive and more timely pursuit of suspected instancesof fraud and abuse, and has a potential for positive impact on programcosts. The direct value to CHAMPUS would include the fraud and abuse deterrenteffect of the stepped-up actions against suspected and documented violators.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Proposed Rule and Comments </ITAG>In FR Doc. 86-1443 appearing in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on January 24, 1986, (51 FR 3210), the Officeof the Secretary of Defense published for public comment a proposed amendmentregarding exclusion, suspension, and termination of CHAMPUS providers forfraud, abuse, and conflict of interest. We received comments from severalgovernment agencies, two national associations related to mental healthinstitutions, and two law firms that represent mental health institutions.We express our appreciation to all the commenters for the time they tookin providing their comments. The following summarizes the comments, suggestions,and the actions taken. First, after additional review, we have concluded that the provisions definingfraud in the proposed rule appear to include a more rigorous standard forestablishing fraud than is required by applicable case law. In civil casesinvolving false claims, it has generally been held that proof of intentis unnecessary, so long as the individual committing the fraudulent actknew (or with appropriate inquiry, would have known) that the claim wasfalse. For example, see <T3>United States</T3> v.<T3> Hughes</T3>, 585 F.2d 284 (7th Cir. 1978) and <T3>United States</T3> v. <T3>Cooperative Grain and Supply Co.</T3>, 474 F.2d 47 (8th Cir. 1973).In addition, intent is not required in the majority of judicial circuitsfor proof of fraud under the Federal Civil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C.3729) (a practice expected to be followed in enforcement of the ProgramFraud Civil Remedies Act of 1986 (31 U.S.C. 3801) as it applies to CHAMPUS)or the Criminal False Claims or False Statements Acts (18 U.S.C. 287, 1001).Accordingly, we have eliminated the requirement to prove intent for fraudand have made necessary revisions in andSection; 199.2(b) of this final rule.Three commenters raised concerns regarding the definition of abuse. Essentially,two of them commented that the definition is too vague and broad and suggestedthat without provider pre-termination hearings, a more precise standardfor abuse is needed. The third commenter suggested the regulations shouldat least require that OCHAMPUS make a finding that the participants inthe alleged abuse knew or should have known either (1) that the allegedpractice would result in excessive cost to CHAMPUS; (2) that the servicesor supplies were not medically necessary; or (3) the services or care failedto meet professionally recognized standards. These commenters suggestedthat isolated instances of providing medically unnecessary services orwaiving patient cost-shares should not be construed as abuse. The definition of abuse is reasonably similar to definitions of abuse establishedunder other health care programs, including the definition used under Medicare.In addition, it is reasonable to expect providers of health care to befamiliar with, and comply with, the recognized standards of care establishedfor their profession; to be familiar with the requirements for being anauthorized CHAMPUS provider and the criteria for CHAMPUS coverage of servicesand supplies furnished; and to be cognizant of acceptable sound fiscalbusiness and medical practices or the reasonable financial consequencesto CHAMPUS and CHAMPUS beneficiaries of the providers' practices. In viewof these expectations, we do not believe the definition of abuse to betoo vague or broad. In addition, specific examples of fraud and abuse wereset forth in the amendment to provide further understanding of the typesof practices which are considered abuse under CHAMPUS. Some revisions havebeen made in the examples of abuse in andSection; 199.9. Therefore, we donot believe that OCHAMPUS should be required to find that a provider furnishingmedically unnecessary services that result in excessive costs did so knowingly.Such a requirement could create a loophole permitting incompetent providerswho are not knowledgeable of professional standards to continue renderingpoor quality care to our beneficiaries. For these reasons we cannot addsuch a requirement.It was not our intent that single, isolated incidents of abuse would, generally,result in the initiation of administrative remedies under this amendment.Unless a single, isolated incident is considered gross and flagrant, animproper pattern of practice will normally be the basis of a finding ofabuse under CHAMPUS. We are clarifying this in the note that follows thedefinition of abuse in andSection; 199.2(b). We also have added a new provision in andSection; 199.9(h)(2)(i)(D) thatwill, generally, give a provider an opportunity for a pre-sanction meetingto present evidence or argument to an OCHAMPUS official. One commenter pointed out that the definition of abuse used in the proposedregulations adopts concepts from the Medicare program but does not providefor peer review organizations (PROs). The commenter noted that submittingclaims for services that are not medically necessary is an abuse and thisraises problems for residential treatment centers in that the distinctionbetween what is and what is not medically necessary is open to more disputein psychiatry than for treatment in acute care facilities. This commenterraised concerns that these regulations would grant CHAMPUS extra powersover clinical issues. OCHAMPUS will be utilizing Medicare PROs for review of inpatient hospitalcare paid for through the diagnosis related group (DRG) method. For thisreason some clarifications have been included in this amendment to increasethe similarities in certain selected CHAMPUS and Medicare provisions. Forexample, the CHAMPUS definition of appropriate medical care has been clarifiedby specific reference to services being economically furnished. This isconsidered only a clarification in that application of the CHAMPUS definitionhas always included the concept of economically furnished services. Aside from the utilization of Medicare PROs, an effective CHAMPUS peerreview mechanism currently exists. This involves medical reviewers of theCHAMPUS contractors and reviewers from national professional organizations.On medical issues, CHAMPUS relies on scientific studies, medical literature,national professional assessments, the general medical community and otherappropriate sources for information. Providers and patient records arereviewed by professionals who are specialized in mental health care and,with adequate resources available, we do not believe that medical necessitydeterminations in such cases would be difficult. Further, with the submissionof claims or appeals, providers are given the opportunity to submit anydocumentary evidence in support of their position. In addition, as notedabove, a case of abuse will normally require a pattern of providing unnecessaryservices. With reference to the records related requirements in andSection; 199.2(b),andSection; 199.9(b)(6), and andSection; 199.10(a)(3), one commenter suggestedthat an adequate account of the importance of the physician-patient andpsychotherapist-patient privileges be taken. The commenter suggested thatOCHAMPUS should provide for protection of the confidentiality of recordswithin OCHAMPUS. OCHAMPUS must have adequate access to records in order to conduct auditsand make determinations. Beneficiaries and providers do not have to providemedical records to CHAMPUS or its contractors; however, failure to provideaccess to medical records can result in the claim (or claims) being deniedCHAMPUS cost-sharing. The burden is on the beneficiary and provider toestablish entitlement to CHAMPUS cost-sharing. OCHAMPUS procedures do accountfor privacy and confidentiality of records, and CHAMPUS records are maintainedin accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Act. With reference to the definitions of adequate medical documentation inandSection; 199.2(b), a commenter suggested that no provider should be requiredto comply with ``CHAMPUS issuances'' unless notice of the issuance wassent to the provider. In clarification, ``CHAMPUS issuances'' meant the CHAMPUS Policy Manualand the CHAMPUS operations manuals which provide interpretation of theCHAMPUS regulation, clarifying policy, and implementing procedures. However,in this final rule we have made some minor revisions in the definitionsof adequate medical documentation in andSection; 199.2(b) and have deletedthe reference to ``CHAMPUS issuances.'' In general, the source of thisdefinition is the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizationsrecord keeping requirements, prior final decisions of the Assistant Secretaryof Defense (Health Affairs), and the CHAMPUS regulation. Failure to produceadequate medical documentation of the care provided is a basis for denyingCHAMPUS cost-sharing.Several comments were received regarding the mandatory and discretionaryperiods of sanction set forth in the proposed rule. In order to simplifythe sanction procedures and remedies, the pertinent subsections have beenrewritten to consolidate the procedures and to eliminate mandatory sanctionperiods in most cases. The only mandatory sanction periods which remainare those which are adopted from sanctions imposed by other agencies ofthe federal government, state, or local licensing authority. Therefore,except for cases in which the CHAMPUS sanction is imposed <T3>solely </T3>on the basis of sanctions by other agencies, the periodof CHAMPUS sanction may be appealed under CHAMPUS. Two commenters raised concerns that the regulations defining conflict ofinterest in andSection; 199.2(b) and andSection; 199.9(d) are too broad. Oneof them suggested that an active duty member or a civilian Government employeeshould be deemed to have a conflict of interest in making a referral orinfluencing a referral only when they or a close relative have a financialinterest in the referral. The other commenter suggested that the revisionsbe made to include language requiring personal gain or appearance of improprietyin influencing referrals to others. A third commenter suggested that wealso consider those situations as conflict of interest where service membersand Government employees have the apparent opportunity to exert influenceon the referrals. The broader definition was intended to include all those situations asconflict of interest where an authorized CHAMPUS provider employs an activeduty Uniformed Service member or civilian Government employee who has theopportunity to exert influence on the referral of CHAMPUS beneficiariesto the employing provider. However, we have made necessary revisions inthe conflict of interest provisions in andSection; 199.2(b) and andSection;199.9(d) where we have maintained the regulatory intent and have adoptedsome of the suggestions of the commenters. Although no public comments were received on the ``dual compensation''provisions of the proposed rule, we have recently received comments thatthe CHAMPUS regulation may be overly broad in its application of the dualcompensation law to all civilian employees of the Government. We recognizethat there are tests established by case law and decisions of the ComptrollerGeneral for determining whether the dual compensation provisions applyin each individual case. However, in administering a program in which millionsof claims are processed annually, it is impracticable to apply the establishedtests to each individual claim to avoid expending appropriated funds inviolation of law. Rather, it is necessary to have an easily administeredpolicy which can be used in an automated claims processing system to excludeall cases in which a provider may be in violation of the law. In addition,all providers who fall within the general category covered by the ``dualcompensation'' provisions (i.e., civilian employees of the Government)are subject to Government rules and policies regarding ``conflicts of interest.''Such rules and policies prohibit not only actual conflict of interest situationsbut also situations in which the appearance of conflict of interest mayexist. Again, it is impossible to scrutinize each individual claim to ensurethat no possible violation of the rules and policies regarding conflictof interest occur when adjudicating millions of claims each year in a highlyautomated claims processing system. The fact that an individual providermay not be able to include CHAMPUS beneficiaries within his or her medicalpractice is not a primary consideration and does not outweigh the government'sinterests in enforcing laws and policies intended to maintain the public'sconfidence in the conduct of the Government and its employees. The reason for the broad application of the dual compensation provisionsto all Government employees under CHAMPUS, then, is simply one of administrativeefficiency following a balancing of the interests involved. Consideringthat OCHAMPUS is faced with the adjudication of millions of health careclaims each year and given the high degree of freedom among providers ofhealth care to enter into or change their status of employment or associationsof practice on a daily basis, it is deemed administratively impossibleto apply the established tests to <T3>each </T3>provider on <T3>each </T3>claim to avoid expending appropriated funds in violationof law. The problem is further complicated given the numerous interagencyarrangements (for example, resource sharing arrangements between the Departmentof Defense and the Veterans Administration in the provision of health care)and other unique arrangements existing at individual government healthcare facilities whereby civilian employees of one agency have <T3>official duties and responsibilities </T3>to provide health care topatients who are CHAMPUS eligible beneficiaries. This complication maybe further aggravated if legislation currently pending before Congressis adopted and CHAMPUS funds are used directly to pay for care reccivedby CHAMPUS beneficiaries in Veterans Administration facilities. Finally,in the administration of a health care program for Veterans Administrationbeneficiaries referred to as Civilian Health and Medical Program of theVeterans Administration (CHAMPVA), CHAMPUS authorized providers are deemedCHAMPVA providers. In view of the interagency arrangements between theDepartment of Defense and Veterans Administration, it is administrativelyimpossible continually to screen providers who are civilian employees ofthe Veterans Administration to enforce the provisions of law and regulationrelating to dual compensation and conflict of interest. Therefore, we have changed andSection; 199.6(a)(3) to clarify the agency'sposition on this issue. Specifically, to avoid the administrative nightmareof attempting to adjudicate each claim in relation to the multiple establishedtests, it is our position to exclude from authorization as a CHAMPUS provider(and, therefore, as a CHAMPVA provider) any active duty Uniformed Servicemember and any civilian employee of the Government. In addition, a providershall be required to certify on each CHAMPUS (CHAMPVA) claim that he/sheis not an active duty Uniformed Service member or civilian employee ofthe Government. While an individual provider may be prevented from beingan authorized CHAMPUS provider even though no dual compensation (or conflictof interest) situation exists in a specific claim, it is deemed essentialfor CHAMPUS to have an easily administered uniform rule which will ensurecompliance with existing law and regulation.It has also been suggested that we consider adopting regulatory provisionssimilar to authorities in use by the Department of Health and Human Services(DHHS) under section 1128(b) of the Social Security Act. Under section1128(b), DHHS may exclude an entity from Medicare, and require the Stateagency to exclude the entity from Medicaid, whenever the entity is foundto have a person, convicted of a Medicare or Medicaid related crime, withdirect or indirect ownership or control interest of 5 percent or more ofthe entity. DHHS may also exclude an entity from both programs if suchperson is found to be an officer, director, agent or managing employeeof such entity. We have adopted the above suggestion by adding a note in andSection; 199.9(f)(1)(i)(A)and the definitions of ``entity'' and ``ownership or control interest''in andSection; 199.2(b). While this provision allows CHAMPUS to suspend suchentities, it also permits the entities to take proper action to divestthemselves of any direct financial or controlling relationship with sanctionedindividuals. The rule, then, provides reinstatement procedures for theseentities. With reference to andSection; 199.9(f)(1)(iii), one commenter suggested thatthe provision be modified to apply only when the suspension from the otherFederal program is for fraud or abuse as defined under CHAMPUS. We believean authorized provider will be suspended from another Federal program basedon a valid case of fraud or abuse, or lack of competence. It is the responsibilityof a provider to comply with the requirements of the program under whichhe is seeking payment or reimbursement from the government; therefore,a violation of a requirement of any program of the government which risesto the level of fraud or abuse under that program's definition is a fraudagainst the government. It should not be necessary to establish that itwould also have been a fraud or abuse under CHAMPUS. Two commenters raised concerns that the proposed procedures for suspensionsand exclusions fail to meet due process requirements. They suggested thatbefore OCHAMPUS excludes or suspends a provider, that the provider be givenan opportunity for a hearing. Protection of the Government's program andits beneficiaries is traditionally a proper purpose for administrativeaction; therefore, it is precisely the function of the Director, OCHAMPUS,to protect the program and its beneficiaries from the practices that ledto the administrative action of exclusion or suspension. To permit a providerto continue as an authorized CHAMPUS provider pending administrative appealproceedings would not provide the program or its beneficiaries protectionfrom further potential wrongdoing of a provider preliminarily found tobe unfit to participate under CHAMPUS or protection from a provider whohas been found unfit or unqualified to be a CHAMPUS provider. In addition,allowing the provider to remain in an authorized status during administrativeproceedings gives the provider every incentive to delay the proceedingsby taking advantage of any opportunity to prolong the administrative appealproceedings. The fact that an individual provider may not be able to includeCHAMPUS beneficiaries within his or her medical practice following a preliminarydetermination that the provider is unfit to participate under CHAMPUS isnot a primary consideration and does not outweigh the Government's interestsin protecting the program and its beneficiaries. As noted earlier, however,we have added a new provision in andSection; 199.9(h)(2)(i)(D) that will,generally, give a provider an opportunity for a pre-sanction meeting topresent evidence or argument to an OCHAMPUS official. On balance of theinterests involved, the informal pre-sanction meeting and the post-sanctionhearing adequately address any due process requirements. One commenter objected that the rules governing claims processing suspensions,(e.g., andSection; 199.9(h)(1)), provide for no pre-termination notice orhearings. This commenter also suggested that the sections regarding administrativepenalties based on either civil or criminal judgments concerning fraudshould make provision for revocation of the penalties if the court judgmentsare reversed on appeal. The provisions for temporary suspension of claims processing in andSection;199.9(h)(1) is not a final or formal agency action. No notice will be givenif it is considered detrimental to the criminal, civil, or administrativeinvestigation. As noted in the rule, a temporary suspension only delaysthe ultimate payment of appropriate claims; therefore, the decision toinvoke the temporary suspension of claims processing is not an appealableissue under CHAMPUS. With regard to the revocation of penalties, we have added a new provisionas andSection; 199.9(h)(4) that addresses reinstatement of a provider, includinga provider whose conviction has been reversed or vacated on appeal. Theprevious andSection; 199.9(e)(7) regarding the authority to enter into compromisesettlements now applies to the entire andSection; 199.9 and has been redesignatedas andSection; 199.9(1). Finally, as specified in andSection; 199.9(k), CHAMPUS also will notify DHHSof its exclusion, suspension, and termination actions. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Regulatory Procedures </ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires that a regulatory impact analysis be performedon any major rule. A ``major rule'' is defined as one which would: Result in annual effect on the national economy of $100 million or more;Result in a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, any industries,any government agencies, or any geographic regions; or Have significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation or on the ability of U.S.-based enterprises tocompete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or import markets. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that each federal agency prepare,and make available for public comment, a regulatory flexibility analysiswhen the agency issues regulations which would have significant impacton a substantial number of small entities. Under both the Executive Order and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, suchanalyses must, when prepared, examine regulatory alternatives which minimizeunnecessary burden or otherwise assure that regulations are cost-effective.The changes set forth in this final rule will facilitate administrativeelimination of poor quality health care providers from CHAMPUS, protectthe beneficiaries, deter program violators, and control fraud and abuse.The end result will be to minimize poor quality care and health risks forCHAMPUS beneficiaries and to reduce unnecessary costs to the Government.It is hereby certified that this rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act. Also, it is not a ``major rule'' underExecutive Order 12291. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 199 </ITAG>Claims, Handicapped, Health insurance, Military personnel.Accordingly, 32 CFR Part 199 is amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 199_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.

In addition, Uniformed Service members andcivilian employees of the Government are generally prohibited by law andagency regulations and policies from participating in apparent or actualconflict of interest situations in which a potential for personal gainexists or in which there is an appearance of impropriety or incompatibilitywith the performance of their official duties or responsibilities. TheDepartments of Defense, Health and Human Services, and Transportation havea responsibility, when disbursing appropriated funds in the payment ofCHAMPUS benefits, to ensure that the laws and regulations are not violated.Therefore, active duty Uniformed Service members (including a reserve memberwhile on active duty and civilian employees of the United States Governmentshall not be authorized to be CHAMPUS providers. While individual employeesof the Government may be able to demonstrate that the furnishing of careto CHAMPUS beneficiaries may not be incompatible with their official dutiesand responsibilities, the processing of millions of CHAMPUS claims eachyear does not enable Program administrators to efficiently review the statusof the provider on each claim to ensure that no conflict of interest ordual compensation situation exists. The problem is further complicatedgiven the numerous interagency agreements (for example, resource sharingarrangements between the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administrationin the provision of health care) and other unique arrangements which existat individual treatment facilities around the country. While an individualprovider may be prevented from being an authorized CHAMPUS provider eventhough no conflict of interest or dual compensation situation exists, itis essential for CHAMPUS to have an easily administered, uniform rule whichwill ensure compliance with the existing laws and regulations. Therefore,a provider who is an active duty Uniformed Service member or civilian employeeof the Government shall not be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. In addition,a provider shall certify on each CHAMPUS claim that he/she is not an activeduty Uniformed Service member or civilian employee of the Government.

The remedies impact institutional providers, professionalproviders, and beneficiaries (including parents, guardians, or other representativesof beneficiaries), and cover situations involving criminal fraud, civilfraud, administrative determinations of conflicts of interest or dual compensation,and administrative determinations of fraud or abuse. The administrativeactions, remedies, and procedures may differ based upon whether the initialfindings were made by a court of law, another agency, or the Director,OCHAMPUS (or designee). (2) This section also sets forth provisions for invoking administrativeremedies in situations requiring administrative action to enforce provisionsof law, regulation, and policy in the administration of CHAMPUS and toensure quality of care for CHAMPUS beneficiaries. Examples of such situationsmay include a case in which it is discovered that a provider fails to meetrequirements under this part to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider; a casein which the provider ceases to be qualified as a CHAMPUS provider becauseof suspension or revocation of the provider's license by a local licensingauthority; or a case in which a provider meets the minimum requirementsunder this part but, nonetheless, it is determined that it is in the bestinterest of the CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries that the provider shouldnot be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. (3) The administrative remedies set forth in this section are in additionto, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or sanctions authorized by lawor regulation. For example, administrative action under this section maybe taken in a particular case even if the same case will be or has beenprocessed under the administrative procedures established by the Departmentof Defense to implement the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act. (4) Providers seeking payment from the Federal Government through programssuch as CHAMPUS have a duty to familiarize themselves with, and complywith, the program requirements. (5) CHAMPUS contractors and peer review organizations have a responsibilityto apply provisions of this regulation in the discharge of their duties,and to report all known situations involving fraud, abuse, or conflictof interest. Failure to report known situations involving fraud, abuse,or conflict of interest will result in the withholding of administrativepayments or other contractual remedies as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS,or a designee. (b) <T3>Abuse. </T3>The term ``abuse'' generally describes incidents and practiceswhich may directly or indirectly cause financial loss to the Governmentunder CHAMPUS or to CHAMPUS beneficiaries. For the definition of abuse,see andSection; 199.2 of this part. The type of abuse to which CHAMPUS ismost vulnerable is the CHAMPUS claim involving the overutilization of medicaland health care services. To avoid abuse situations, providers have certainobligations to provide services and supplies under CHAMPUS which are: Furnishedat the appropriate level and only when and to the extent medically necessaryas determined under the provisions of this part; of a quality that meetsprofessionally recognized standards of health care; and, supported by adequatemedical documentation as may reasonably be required under this Part bythe Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, to evidence the medical necessityand quality of services furnished, as well as the appropriateness of thelevel of care. A provider's failure to comply with these obligations canresult in sanctions being imposed by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee,under this section. Even when administrative remedies are not initiatedunder this section, abuse situations under CHAMPUS are a sufficient basisfor denying all or any part of CHAMPUS cost-sharing of individual claims.The types of abuse or possible abuse situations under CHAMPUS include,but are not limited, to the following: (1) A pattern of waiver of beneficiary (patient) cost-share or deductible.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> In a case of a legitimate bad debt write-off of patientcost-share or deductible, the provider's record should include documentationas to what efforts were made to collect the debt, when the debt was writtenoff, why the debt was written off, and the amount of the debt written off.</ITAG>(2) Improper billing practices. Examples include, charging CHAMPUS beneficiariesrates for services and supplies that are in excess of those charges routinelycharged by the provider to the general public, commercial health insurancecarriers, or other federal health benefit entitlement programs for thesame or similar services. (This includes dual fee schedules_one for CHAMPUSbeneficiaries and one for other patients or third-party payers. This alsoincludes billing other third-party payers the same as CHAMPUS is billedbut accepting less than the billed amount as reimbursement. However, aformal discount arrangement such as through a preferred provider organization,may not necessarily constitute an improper billing practice.) (3) A pattern of claims for services which are not medically necessaryor, if medically necessary, not to the extent rendered. For example, abattery of diagnostic tests are given when, based on the diagnosis, fewertests were needed. (4) Care of inferior quality. For example, consistently furnishing medicalor mental health services that do not meet accepted standards of care.(5) Failure to maintain adequate medical or financial records. (6) Refusal to furnish or allow the Government (for example, OCHAMPUS)or Government contractors access to records related to CHAMPUS claims.(7) Billing substantially in excess of customary or reasonable chargesunless it is determined by OCHAMPUS that the excess charges are justifiedby unusual circumstances or medical complications requiring additionaltime, effort, or expense in localities when it is accepted medical practiceto make an extra charge in such cases. (8) Unauthorized use of the term ``Civilian Health and Medical Programof the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS)'' in private business. While the useof the term ``CHAMPUS'' is not prohibited by federal statute, misrepresentationor deception by use of the term ``CHAMPUS'' to imply an official connectionwith the Government or to defraud CHAMPUS beneficiaries may be a violationof federal statute. Regardless of whether the actual use of the term ``CHAMPUS''may be actionable under federal statute, the unauthorized or deceptiveuse of the term ``CHAMPUS'' in private business will be considered abusefor purposes of this Section. (c) <T3>Fraud.</T3> For the definition of fraud, see andSection; 199.2 of thispart. Examples of situations which, for the purpose of this Part, are presumedto be fraud include, but are not limited to: (1) Submitting CHAMPUS claims (including billings by providers when theclaim is submitted by the beneficiary) for services, supplies, or equipmentnot furnished to, or used by, CHAMPUS beneficiaries. For example, billingor claiming services when the provider was on call (other than an authorizedstandby charge) and did not provide any specific medical care to the beneficiary;providing services to an ineligible person and billing or submitting aclaim for the services in the name of an eligible CHAMPUS beneficiary;billing or submitting a CHAMPUS claim for an office visit for a missedappointment; or billing or submitting a CHAMPUS claim for individual psychotherapywhen a medical visit was the only service provided. (2) Billing or submitting a CHAMPUS claim for costs for noncovered or nonchargeableservices, supplies, or equipment disguised as covered items. Some examplesare: (i) Billings or CHAMPUS claims for services which would be coveredexcept for the frequency or duration of the services, such as billing orsubmitting a claim for two one-hour psychotherapy sessions furnished onseparate days when the actual service furnished was a two-hour therapysession on a single day, (ii) spreading the billing or claims for servicesover a time period that reduces the apparent frequency to a level thatmay be cost-shared by CHAMPUS, (iii) charging to CHAMPUS, directly or indirectly,costs not incurred or not reasonably allowable to the services billed orclaimed under CHAMPUS, for example, costs attributable to nonprogram activities,other enterprises, or the personal expenses of principals, or (iv) billingor submitting claim on a fee-for-service basis when in fact a personalservice to a specific patient was not performed and the service renderedis part of the overall management of, for example, the laboratory or x-raydepartment. (3) Breach of a provider participation agreement which results in the beneficiary(including parent, guardian, or other representative) being billed foramounts which exceed the CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge or cost. (4) Billings or CHAMPUS claims for supplies or equipment which are clearlyunsuitable for the patient's needs or are so lacking in quality or sufficiencyfor the purpose as to be virtually worthless.(5) Billings or CHAMPUS claims which involve flagrant and persistent overutilizationof services without proper regard for results, the patient's ailments,condition, medical needs, or the physician's orders. (6) Misrepresentations of dates, frequency, duration, or description ofservices rendered, or of the identity of the recipient of the servicesor the individual who rendered the services. (7) Submitting falsified or altered CHAMPUS claims or medical or mentalhealth patient records which misrepresent the type, frequency, or durationof services or supplies or misrepresent the name(s) of the individual(s)who provided the services or supplies. (8) Duplicate billings or CHAMPUS claims. This includes billing or submittingCHAMPUS claims more than once for the same services, billing or submittingclaims both to CHAMPUS and the beneficiary for the same services, or billingor submitting claims both to CHAMPUS and other third-parties (such as otherhealth insurance or government agencies) for the same services, withoutmaking full disclosure of material facts or immediate, voluntary repaymentor notification to CHAMPUS upon receipt of payments which combined exceedthe CHAMPUS-determined allowable charge of the services involved. (9) Misrepresentation by a provider of his or her credentials or concealinginformation or business practices which bear on the provider's qualificationsfor authorized CHAMPUS provider status. For example, a provider representingthat he or she has a qualifying doctorate in clinical psychology when thedegree is not from a regionally accredited university. (10) Reciprocal billing. Billing or claiming services which were furnishedby another provider or furnished by the billing provider in a capacityother than as billed or claimed. For example, practices such as the following:(i) One provider performing services for another provider and the latterbills as though he had actually performed the services (e.g., a weekendfill-in); (ii) providing service as an institutional employee and billingas a professional provider for the services; (iii) billing for professionalservices when the services were provided by another individual who wasan institutional employee; (iv) billing for professional services at ahigher provider profile than would be paid for the person actually furnishingthe services, (for example, bills reflecting that an M.D. or Ph.D. performedthe services when services were actually furnished by a licensed socialworker, psychiatric nurse, or marriage and family counselor); or (v) anauthorized provider billing for services which were actually furnishedby an unauthorized or sanctioned provider. (11) Submitting CHAMPUS claims at a rate higher than a rate establishedbetween CHAMPUS and the provider, if such a rate has been established.For example, billing or claiming a rate in excess of the provider's mostfavored rate limitation specified in a residential treatment center agreement.(12) Arrangements by providers with employees, independent contractors,suppliers, or others which appear to be designed primarily to overchargethe CHAMPUS through various means (such as commissions, fee-splitting,and kickbacks) used to divert or conceal improper or unnecessary costsor profits. (13) Agreements or arrangements between the supplier and recipient (recipientcould be either a provider or beneficiary, including the parent, guardian,or other representative of the beneficiary) that result in billings orclaims which include unnecessary costs or charges to CHAMPUS. (d) <T3>Conflict of Interest. </T3>(1) Conflict of interest includes any situationwhere an active duty member of the Uniformed Services (including a reservemember while on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive dutytraining) or civilian employee of the United States Government, throughan official federal position has the apparent or actual opportunity toexert, directly or indirectly, any influence on the referral of CHAMPUSbeneficiaries to himself/herself or others with some potential for personalgain or the appearance of impropriety. Although individuals under contractto the Uniformed Services are not considered ``employees,'' such individualsare subject to conflict of interest provisions by express terms of theircontracts and, for purposes of this Part, may be considered to be involvedin conflict of interest situations as a result of their contract positions.In any situation involving potential conflict of interest of a UniformedService employee, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may refer thecase to the Uniformed Service concerned for appropriate review and action.If such a referral is made, a report of the results of findings and actiontaken shall be made to the Director, OCHAMPUS, by the Uniformed Servicehaving jurisdiction within 90 days of receiving the referral. (2) CHAMPUS cost-sharing shall be denied on any claim where a conflictof interest situation is found to exist. This denial of cost-sharing applieswhether the claim is submitted by the individual who provided the care,the institutional provider in which the care was furnished, or the beneficiary.(e) <T3>Dual Compensation. </T3>(1) Federal law (5 U.S.C. 5536) prohibits activeduty members of the Uniformed Services or employees (including part-timeor intermittent) appointed in the civil service of the United States Governmentfrom receiving additional compensation from the Government above theirnormal pay and allowances. This prohibition applies to CHAMPUS paymentsfor care furnished to CHAMPUS beneficiaries by active duty members of theUniformed Services or civilian employees of the Government. (2) CHAMPUS cost-sharing of a claim shall be denied where the servicesor supplies were provided by an active duty member of the Uniformed Servicesor a civilian employee of the Government. This denial of CHAMPUS paymentapplies whether the claim for reimbursement is filed by the individualwho provided the care, the institutional provider in which the care wasfurnished, or by the beneficiary.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Physicians of the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) maybe assigned to areas where there is a shortage of medical providers. Althoughthese physicians would be prohibited from accepting CHAMPUS payments asindividuals if they are employees of the United States Government, theprivate organizations to which they may be assigned may be eligible forpayment, as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.</ITAG>(3) The prohibition against dual compensation does not apply to individualsunder contract to the Uniformed Services or the Government. (f) <T3>Administrative Remedies. </T3>Administrative remedies available underCHAMPUS in this section are set forth below. (1) <T3>Provider exclusion or suspension. </T3>The Director, OCHAMPUS, or adesignee, shall have the authority to exclude or suspend an otherwise authorizedCHAMPUS provider from the program based on any criminal conviction or civiljudgment involving fraud by the provider; fraud or abuse under CHAMPUSby the provider; exclusion or suspension of the provider by another agencyof the Federal Government, a state, or local licensing authority; participationin a conflict of interest situation by the provider; or, when it is inthe best interests of the program or CHAMPUS beneficiaries to exclude orsuspend a provider under CHAMPUS. In all cases, the exclusion or suspensionof a provider shall be effective 15 calendar days from the date on thewritten initial determination issued under paragraph (h)(2) of this section.(i) <T3>Criminal conviction or civil judgment involving fraud by a provider._</T3>(A)<T3>Criminal conviction involving CHAMPUS fraud. </T3>A provider convictedby a Federal, state, foreign, or other court of competent jurisdictionof a crime involving CHAMPUS fraud, whether the crime is a felony or misdemeanor,shall be excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS for a period of time as determinedby the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. The CHAMPUS exclusion or suspensionapplies whether or not the provider, as a result of the conviction, receivesprobation or the sentence is suspended or deferred, and whether or notthe conviction or sentence is under appeal.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>Under the above paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) of this section,an entity may be excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS whenever the entityis found to have a person, convicted of a crime involving CHAMPUS fraud,who has a direct or indirect ownership or control interest (see andSection;199.2) of 5 percent or more in the entity, or is an officer, director,agent or managing employee of the entity. The entity will have an opportunityto provide evidence to show that the ownership or control relationshiphas ceased. While an entity will not be excluded or suspended from CHAMPUSfor employing a provider who has been sanctioned under this Section, theentity will be denied CHAMPUS payment for any services furnished by thesanctioned employee. As an authorized CHAMPUS provider, the entity is responsiblefor ensuring that all CHAMPUS claims involve services furnished to CHAMPUSbeneficiaries by employees who meet all requirements under CHAMPUS forprovider status.</ITAG>(B) <T3>Criminal conviction involving fraud of other Federal programs. </T3>Anyprovider convicted by a Federal, state, or other court of competent jurisdictionof a crime involving another Federal health care or benefit program (suchas plans administered under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social SecurityAct, Federal Workmen's Compensation, and the Federal Employees Program(FEP) for employee health insurance), whether the crime is a felony ormisdemeanor, shall be excluded from CHAMPUS for a period of time as determinedby the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. The CHAMPUS exclusion or suspensionapplies whether or not the provider, as a result of the conviction, receivesprobation or the sentence is suspended or deferred, and whether or notthe conviction or sentence is under appeal. (C) <T3>Criminal conviction involving fraud of non-Federal programs. </T3>Anyprovider convicted by a Federal, state, foreign, or other court of competentjurisdiction of a crime involving any non-Federal health benefit programor private insurance involving health benefits may be excluded or suspendedfrom CHAMPUS for a period of time as determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS,or a designee. (D) <T3>Civil fraud involving CHAMPUS. </T3>If a judgment involving civil fraudhas been entered (whether or not it is appealed) against a provider ina civil action involving CHAMPUS benefits (whether or not other Federalprograms are involved), the provider shall be excluded or suspended fromCHAMPUS for a period determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.(E) <T3>Civil fraud involving other programs. </T3>If a judgment involvingcivil fraud has been entered against a provider (whether or not it hasbeen appealed) in a civil action involving other public or private healthcare programs or health insurance, the provider may be excluded or suspendedfor a period of time determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.(ii) <T3>Administrative determination of fraud or abuse under CHAMPUS. </T3>Ifthe Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, determines that a provider has committedfraud or abuse as defined in this part, the provider shall be excludedor suspended from CHAMPUS for a period of time determined by the Director,OCHAMPUS, or designee. (iii) <T3>Administrative determination that the provider has been excluded orsuspended by another agency of the Federal Government, a state, or locallicensing authority. </T3>Any provider who is excluded or suspended byany other Federal health care program (for example, Medicare), shall beexcluded or suspended under CHAMPUS. A provider who has his/her credentialsrevoked through a Veterans Administration or Military Department credentialsreview process and who is excluded, suspended, terminated, retired, orseparated, shall also be excluded or suspended under CHAMPUS. The periodof time of exclusion or suspension shall be determined by the Director,OCHAMPUS, or a designee, pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.(iv) <T3>Administrative determination that the provider has participated ina conflict of interest situation. </T3>The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee,may exclude or suspend any provider who has knowingly been involved ina conflict of interest situation under CHAMPUS. The period of time of exclusionor suspension shall be determined by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee,pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section. For purposes of this administrativedetermination, it will be presumed that a CHAMPUS provider knowingly participatedin a conflict of interest situation if the provider employs, in the treatmentof a CHAMPUS beneficiary (resulting in a CHAMPUS claim), any medical personnelwho are active duty members of the Uniformed Services or civilian employeesof the Government. The burden of proof to rebut this presumption restswith the CHAMPUS provider. Two exceptions will be recognized to the presumptionthat a conflict of interest exists. First, indirect CHAMPUS payments maybe made to private organizations to which physicians of the National HealthService Corps (NHSC) are assigned. Second, any off-duty Government medicalpersonnel employed in an emergency room of an acute care hospital willbe presumed not to have had the opportunity to exert, directly or indirectly,any influence on the referral of CHAMPUS beneficiaries; therefore, CHAMPUSpayments may be made to the employing hospital <T3>provided </T3>the medical care was not furnished directly by the off-dutyGovernment medical personnel in violation of dual compensation provisions.(v) <T3>Administrative determination that it is in the best interests of theCHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries to exclude or suspend a provider</T3>_(A)<T3>Unethical or improper practices or unprofessional conduct. </T3>(<T3>1</T3>) In most instances, unethical or improper practices or unprofessionalconduct by a provider will be program abuse and subject the provider toexclusion or suspension for abuse. However, in some cases such practicesand conduct may provide an independent basis for exclusion or suspensionof the provider by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (<T3>2</T3>) Such exclusions or suspensions may be based on findings orrecommendations of state licensure boards, boards of quality assurance,other regulatory agencies, state medical societies, peer review organizations,or other professional associations. (B) <T3>In any other case in which the Director, OCHAMPUS (or designee), determinesthat exclusion or suspension of a provider is in the best interests ofCHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries. </T3>The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee,may exclude or suspend any provider if it is determined that the authorizationof that particular provider under CHAMPUS poses an unreasonable potentialfor fraud, abuse, or professional misconduct. Any documented misconductby the provider reflecting on the business or professional competence orintegrity of the provider may be considered. Situations in which the Director,OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may take administrative action under this Sectionto protect CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries include, but are not limitedto, a case in which it is determined that a provider poses an unreasonablepotential cost to the Government to monitor the provider for fraud or abuseand to avoid the issuance of erroneous payments; or that the provider posesan unreasonable potential harm to the financial or health status of CHAMPUSbeneficiaries; or that the provider poses any other unreasonable threatto the interests of CHAMPUS or CHAMPUS beneficiaries. One example of suchcircumstances involves a provider who, for his/her entire practice or formost of his/her practice, provides or bills for tratment that is not aCHAMPUS benefit, resulting in CHAMPUS frequently and repeatedly denyingclaims as non-covered services. This may occur when a professional providerfurnishes sex therapy (a therapy which may be recognized by the provider'slicensing authority but which is excluded from CHAMPUS coverage) and repeatedlysubmits CHAMPUS claims for the services. (2) <T3>Provider termination. </T3>The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shallterminate the provider status of any provider determined not to meet thequalifications established by this part to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider.(i) <T3>Effective date of termination. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph(g)(2)(ii) of this section, the termination shall be retroactive to thedate on which the provider did not meet the requirements of this Part.(A) The retroactive effective date of termination shall not be limiteddue to the passage of time, erroneous payment of claims, or any other eventswhich may be cited as a basis for CHAMPUS recognition of the provider notwithstandingthe fact that the provider does not meet program qualifications. Unlessspecific provision is made in this part to ``grandfather'' or authorizea provider who does not otherwise meet the qualifications established bythis part, all unqualified providers shall be terminated. (B) Any claims cost-shared or paid under CHAMPUS for services or suppliesfurnished by the provider on or after the effective date of termination,even when the effective date is retroactive, shall be deemed an erroneouspayment unless specific exception is provided in this Part. All erroneouspayments are subject to collection under andSection; 199.11 of this part.(C) If an institution is terminated as an authorized CHAMPUS provider,the institution shall immediately give written notice of the terminationto any CHAMPUS beneficiary (or their parent, guardian, or other representative)admitted to, or receiving care at, the institution on or after the effectivedate of the termination. In addition, when an institution is terminatedwith an effective date of termination after the date of the initial determinationterminating the provider, any beneficiary admitted to the institution priorto the effective date of termination (or their parent, guardian, or otherrepresentative) shall be notified by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee,by certified mail of the termination, and that CHAMPUS cost-sharing ofthe beneficiary's care in the institution will cease as of the effectivedate of the termination. However, any beneficiary admitted to the institutionprior to any grace period extended to the institution under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A)of this section shall be advised that, if the beneficiary's care otherwisequalifies for CHAMPUS coverage, CHAMPUS cost-sharing of the care in theinstitution will continue in order to provide a reasonable period of transitionof care; however the transitional period of CHAMPUS cost-sharing shallnot exceed the last day of the month following the month in which the institution'sstatus as a CHAMPUS provider is terminated. (This authorized CHAMPUS cost-sharingof the inpatient care received during the transition period is an exceptionto the general rule that CHAMPUS payment for care furnished after the effectivedate of termination of the provider's status shall be deemed to be an erroneouspayment.) If a major violation under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this sectionis involved, in order to ensure immediate action is taken to transfer beneficiariesto an approved provider, CHAMPUS cost-sharing shall not be authorized afterthe effective date of termination of the provider's status. (ii) <T3>Institutions not in compliance with CHAMPUS standards. </T3>If it isdetermined that an institution is not in compliance with one or more ofthe standards applicable to its specific category of institution underthis Part, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall take immediatesteps to bring about compliance or terminate the status of the provideras an authorized CHAMPUS provider.(A) <T3>Minor violations.</T3> An institution determined to be in violationof one or more of the standards shall be advised by certified mail of thenature of the discrepancy or discrepancies and will be given a grace periodof 30 days to effect appropriate corrections. The grace period may be extendedat the discretion of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, but in no eventshall the extension exceed 90 days. (<T3>1</T3>) CHAMPUS will not cost-share a claim for any beneficiary admittedduring the grace period. (<T3>2</T3>) Any beneficiary admitted to the institution prior to the graceperiod (or the beneficiary's parent, guardian, or other representative)will be notified by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, in writing,of the minor violations and the grace period granted the institution tocorrect the violations. The beneficiary will also be advised that, if thebeneficiary's care otherwise meets all requirements for CHAMPUS coverage,CHAMPUS cost-sharing will continue during the grace period. (<T3>3</T3>) If the institution submits written notice before the end ofthe grace period that corrective action has been taken <T3>and</T3> if the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, determines thatthe corrective action has eliminated the minor violations, the providerwill be advised that the institution is restored to full status as an authorizedCHAMPUS provider as of 12:01 a.m. on the day written notice of correctionwas received by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, or the day on whichacceptable corrective action was completed in the judgment of the Director,OCHAMPUS, or a designee. Any beneficiary admitted to the institution priorto the grace period will be notified by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee,of the corrective action and that the provider continues to be an authorizedCHAMPUS provider. CHAMPUS cost-sharing for any beneficiary admitted tothe institution during the grace period shall be allowed only for carereceived after 12:01 a.m. on the day written notice of correction was receivedby the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, or the day on which acceptablecorrective action was completed in the judgment of the Director, OCHAMPUS,or a designee. (<T3>4</T3>) If the institution has failed to give notification in writingbefore the end of the grace period that corrective action has been completed<T3>or, </T3>in the judgment of the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee,the institution has not completed acceptable corrective action during thegrace period, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may initiate actionto terminate the provider as an authorized CHAMPUS provider. (B) <T3>Major violations.</T3> If the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, determinesthat an institution is in violation of standards detrimental to life, safety,or health, or substantially in violation of approved treatment programs,immediate action shall be taken to terminate the institution as an authorizedCHAMPUS provider. The institution shall be notified by telegram, certifiedmail, or express mail of the termination under this subparagraph, effectiveon receipt of the notice. The notice shall include a brief statement ofthe nature of violations resulting in the termination and advise the institutionthat an initial determination formalizing the administrative action oftermination will be issued pursuant to paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this sectionwithin 15 days. (3) <T3>Beneficiary sanctions.</T3> (i) With entitlement to CHAMPUS benefitsbased on public law, an eligible beneficiary will not be suspended or excludedfrom CHAMPUS. However, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may takeaction deemed appropriate and reasonable to protect the Government fromthose beneficiaries (including sponsors, parents, guardians, or representativesof beneficiaries) who have submitted false claims. (ii) Pursuant to andSection; 199.11 of this part, the Director, OCHAMPUS,or a designee, may recover erroneous payments on claims involving fraudor false or misleading statements. Remedies for recovery of the erroneouspayments include the use of offset against future CHAMPUS payments. (iii) Under policies adopted by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee,individuals who, based on reliable information, have previously submittedfraudulent or false CHAMPUS claims, may be required to comply with anyprocedures (e.g., partial or total pre-payment audit or review, restrictionto a designated primary care provider, etc.) which the Director, OCHAMPUS,or a designee, deems appropriate to ensure that their future medical careand CHAMPUS claims (including the medical care and CHAMPUS claims submittedby or for members of their family) are valid. (g) <T3>Period of exclusion, suspension, or termination</T3>_(1) <T3>Exclusions or suspensions.</T3> Except as otherwise required by paragraph(g)(1)(i) of this section, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shalldetermine the period of exclusion or suspension for a provider using thefactors set forth in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section.(i) <T3>Exclusion or suspension of a provider based on the provider's exclusionor suspension by another agency of the Federal Government, a state, ora local licensing authority. </T3>If the administrative action under CHAMPUSis based <T3>solely </T3>on the provider's exclusion or suspension by another agency,state, or local licensing authority, the period of exclusion or suspensionunder CHAMPUS shall be for the same length of time of exclusion or suspensionimposed by the other agency, state, or local licensing authority. The providermay request reinstatement as an authorized CHAMPUS provider if reinstatementis achieved under the other program prior to the end of the period of exclusionor suspension. If the administrative action under CHAMPUS is not based<T3>solely </T3>on the provider's exclusion or suspension by another agency,state, or local licensing authority, the minimum period of exclusion orsuspension shall be for the same period of exclusion or suspension imposedby the other agency, state, or local licensing authority. (ii) <T3>Factors to be considered in determining the period of exclusion orsuspension of providers under CHAMPUS. </T3>In determining the period ofexclusion or suspension of a provider, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee,may consider any or all of the following: (A) When the case concerns all or any part of the same issues which havebeen the subject of criminal conviction or civil judgment involving fraudby a provider: (<T3>1</T3>) The period(s) of sentence, probation, and other sanction imposedby court order against the provider may be presumed reasonable and adoptedas the administrative period of exclusion or suspension under CHAMPUS,unless aggravating or mitigating factors exist. (<T3>2</T3>) If any aggravating factors exist, then cause exists for theDirector, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, to consider the factors set forth inparagraph (g)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, in imposing a period of administrativeexclusion or suspension in excess of the period(s) of sentence, probation,and/or other sanctions imposed by court order. Examples of aggravatingfactors include, but are not limited to: (<T3>i</T3>) An administrative determination by the Director, OCHAMPUS,or a designee, that the basis for administrative exclusion or suspensionincludes an act(s) of fraud or abuse under CHAMPUS in addition to, or unrelatedto, an act(s) of fraud included in the court conviction or civil judgment.(<T3>ii</T3>) The fraudulent act(s) involved in the criminal convictionor civil judgment, or similar acts, were committed over a significant periodof time; that is, one year or more. (<T3>iii</T3>) The act(s) of fraud or abuse had an adverse physical, mental,or financial impact on one or more CHAMPUS beneficiaries. (<T3>iv</T3>) The loss or potential loss to CHAMPUS is over $5,000. Theentire amount of loss or potential loss to CHAMPUS due to acts of fraudand abuse will be considered, in addition to the amount of loss involvedin the court conviction or civil judgment, regardless of whether full orpartial restitution has been made to CHAMPUS. (<T3>v</T3>) The provider has a prior court record, criminal or civil, oradministrative record or finding of fraud or abuse. (<T3>3</T3>) If any mitigating factors exist, then cause may exist for theDirector, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, to reduce a period of administrativeexclusion or suspension from any period(s) imposed by court convictionor civil judgment. Only the existence of either of the following two factorsmay be considered in mitigation: (<T3>i</T3>) The criminal conviction or civil judgment only involved threeor fewer misdemeanor offenses, and the total of the estimated losses incurred(including any loss from act(s) not involved in the conviction or judgment)is less than $1,000, regardless of whether full or partial restitutionhas been made. (<T3>ii</T3>) The criminal or civil court proceedings establish that theprovider had a mental, emotional or physical condition, prior to or contemporaneouswith the commission of the act(s), that reduced the provider's criminalor civil culpability. (B) The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may consider the following factorsin determining a reasonable period of exclusion or suspension of a providerunder CHAMPUS: (<T3>1</T3>) The nature of the claims and the circumstances under whichthey were presented; (<T3>2</T3>) The degree of culpability; (<T3>3</T3>) History of prior offenses (including whether claims were submittedwhile the provider was either excluded or suspended pursuant to prior administrativeaction); (<T3>4</T3>) Number of claims involved; (<T3>5</T3>) Dollar amount of claims involved; (<T3>6</T3>) Whether, if a crime was involved, it was a felony or misdemeanor;(<T3>7</T3>) If patients were injured financially, mentally, or physically;the number of patients; and the seriousness of the injury(ies); (<T3>8</T3>) The previous record of the provider under CHAMPUS; (<T3>9</T3>) Whether restitution has been made or arrangements for repaymentaccepted by the Government; (<T3>10</T3>) Whether the provider has resolved the conflict of interestsituations or implemented procedures acceptable to the Director, OCHAMPUS,or a designee, which will prevent conflict of interest in the future; and,(<T3>11</T3>) Such other factors as may be deemed appropriate. (2) <T3>Terminations.</T3> When a provider's status as an authorized CHAMPUSprovider is ended, other than through exclusion or suspension, the terminationis based on a finding that the provider does not meet the qualificationsto be an authorized provider, as set forth in this part. Therefore, theperiod of termination in all cases will be indefinite and will end onlyafter the provider has successfully met the established qualificationsfor authorized provider status under CHAMPUS and has been reinstated underCHAMPUS. Except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, the followingguidelines control the termination of authorized CHAMPUS provider statusfor a provider whose license to practice (or, in the case of an institutionalprovider, to operate) has been temporarily or permanently suspended orrevoked by the jurisdiction issuing the license. (i) Termination of the provider under CHAMPUS shall continue even if theprovider obtains a license to practice in a second jurisdiction duringthe period of suspension or revocation of the provider's license by theoriginal licensing jurisdiction. A provider who has licenses to practicein two or more jurisdictions and has one or more license(s) suspended orrevoked will also be terminated as a CHAMPUS provider. (A) Professional providers shall remain terminated from the CHAMPUS untilthe jurisdiction(s) suspending or revoking the provider's license(s) topractice restores it or removes the impediment to restoration. (B) Institutional providers shall remain terminated under CHAMPUS untiltheir license is restored. In the event the facility is sold, transferred,or reorganized as a new legal entity, and a license issued under a newname or to a different legal entity, the new entity must submit an applicationto be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. (ii) If the CHAMPUS provider status is terminated due to the loss of theprovider's license, the effective date shall be retroactive to the datethe provider lost the license; however, in the case of a professional providerwho has licenses in two or more jurisdictions and submitted claims froma jurisdiction from which he/she had a valid license, the effective dateof the termination will be 15 calendar days from the date of the writteninitial determination of termination for purposes of claims from the jurisdictionin which the provider still has a valid license. (h) <T3>Procedures for initiating and implementing the administrative remedies</T3>_(1)<T3>Temporary suspension of claims processing.</T3> (i) In general, temporarysuspension of claims processing may be invoked to protect the interestsof the Government for a period reasonably necessary to complete investigationor appropriate criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings. The temporarysuspension only delays the ultimate payment of otherwise appropriate claims.When claims processing involving a participating provider is temporarilysuspended, the participation agreement remains in full force and the providercannot repudiate the agreement because of the delay in the final dispositionof the claim(s). Once it has been determined appropriate to end the temporarysuspension of claims processing, CHAMPUS claims which were the subjectof the suspension and which are otherwise determined to be in compliancewith the requirements of law and regulation, will be processed to completionand payment <T3>unless</T3> such action is deemed inappropriate as a result of criminal,civil, or administrative remedies ultimately invoked in the case. (ii) When adequate evidence exists to determine that a provider or beneficiaryis submitting fraudulent or false claims or claims involving practicesthat may be fraud or abuse as defined by this part, the Director, OCHAMPUS,or a designee, may suspend CHAMPUS claims processing (in whole or in part)for claims submitted by the beneficiary or any CHAMPUS claims involvingcare furnished by the provider. The temporary suspension of claims processingfor care furnished by a provider may be invoked against all such claims,whether or not the claims are submitted by the beneficiary or by the provideras a participating CHAMPUS provider. In cases involving a provider, noticeof the suspension of claims processing may also be given to the beneficiarycommunity either directly or indirectly through notice to appropriate militaryfacilities, health benefit advisors, and the information or news media.(A) Adequate evidence is any information sufficient to support the reasonablebelief that a particular act or omission has occurred. (B) Indictment or any other initiation of criminal charges, filing of acomplaint for civil fraud, issuance of an administrative complaint underthe Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act, or issuance of an initial determinationunder this part for submitting fraudulent or false claims or claims involvingpractices that may be fraud or abuse as defined by this part, shall constituteadequate evidence for invoking temporary suspension of claims processing.(iii) The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, may suspend CHAMPUS claimsprocessing without first notifying the provider or beneficiary of the intentto suspend payments. Following a decision to invoke a temporary suspension,however, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall issue written noticeadvising the provider or beneficiary that: (A) A temporary suspension of claims processing has been ordered and astatement of the basis of the decision to suspend payment. Unless the suspensionis based on any of the actions set forth in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) ofthis section, the notice shall describe the suspected acts or omissionsin terms sufficient to place the provider or beneficiary on notice withoutdisclosing the Government's evidence. (B) Within 30 days (or, upon written request received by OCHAMPUS duringthe 30 days and for good cause shown, within 60 days) from the date ofthe notice, the provider or beneficiary may: (<T3>1</T3>) Submit to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, in writing,information (including documentary evidence) and argument in oppositionto the suspension, provided the additional specific information raisesa genuine dispute over the material facts, or (<T3>2</T3>) Submit a written request to present in person evidence or argumentto the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. All such presentations shallbe made at the Office of Civilian Health and Medical Program of the UniformedServices (OCHAMPUS) in Aurora, Colorado, at the provider's or beneficiary'sown expense. (C) Additional proceedings to determine disputed material facts may beconducted unless: (<T3>1</T3>) The suspension is based on any of the actions set forth inparagraph (h)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, or, (<T3>2</T3>) A determination is made, on the basis of the advice of theresponsible Government official (e.g., an official of the Department ofJustice, the designated Reviewing Official under the Program Fraud CivilRemedies Act, etc.), that the substantial interests of the Government inpending or contemplated legal or administrative proceedings based on thesame facts as the suspension would be prejudiced. (iv) If the beneficiary or provider submits, either in writing or in person,additional information or argument in opposition to the suspension, theDirector, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall issue a suspending official'sdecision which modifies, terminates, or leaves in force the suspensionof claims processing. However, a decision to terminate or modify the suspensionshall be without prejudice to the subsequent imposition of suspension ofclaims processing, imposition of sanctions under this andSection; 199.9,the recovery of erroneous payments under andSection; 199.11 of this part,or any other administrative or legal action authorized by law or regulation.The suspending official's decision shall be in writing as follows: (A) A written decision based on all the information in the administrativerecord, including any submission by the beneficiary or provider, shallbe final in a case: (<T3>1</T3>) Based on any of the actions set forth in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(B)of this section, (<T3>2</T3>) In which the beneficiary's or provider's submission does notraise a genuine dispute over material facts, or (<T3>3</T3>) In which additional proceedings to determine disputed materialfacts have been denied on the basis of advice of a responsible Governmentofficial that the substantial interests of the Government in pending orcontemplated legal or administrative proceedings would be prejudiced. (B) In a case in which additional proceedings are necessary as to disputedmaterial facts, the suspending official's decision shall advise the beneficiaryor provider that the case has been referred for handling as a hearing underandSection; 199.10 of this part. (v) A suspension of claims processing may be modified or terminated forreasons such as: (A) Newly discovered evidence; (B) Elimination of any of the causes for which the suspension was invoked;or (C) Other reasons the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, deems appropriate.(vi) A suspension of claims processing shall be for a temporary periodpending the completion of investigation and any ensuing legal or administrativeproceedings, unless sooner terminated by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee,or as provided in this subparagraph. (A) If legal or administrative proceedings are not initiated within 12months after the date of the suspension notice, the suspension shall beterminated unless the Government official responsible for initiation ofthe legal or administrative action requests its extension, in which caseit may be extended for an additional 6 months. In no event may a suspensionextend beyond 18 months, unless legal or administrative proceedings havebeen initiated during that period. (B) The Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, shall notify the Governmentofficial responsible for initiation of the legal or administrative actionof the proposed termination of the suspension, at least 30 days beforethe 12-month period expires, to give the official an opportunity to requestan extension. (2) <T3>Notice of proposed administrative sanction. </T3>(i) A provider shallbe notified in writing of the proposed action to exclude, suspend, or terminatethe provider's status as an authorized CHAMPUS provider. (A) The notice shall state which sanction will be taken and the effectivedate of that sanction as determined in accordance with the provisions ofthis Part.(B) The notice shall inform the provider of the situation(s), circumstance(s),or action(s) which form the basis for the proposed sanction and referencethe paragraph of this Part under which the administrative action is beingtaken. (C) The notice will be sent to the provider's last known business or officeaddress (or home address if there is no known business address.) (D) The notice shall offer the provider an opportunity to respond within30 days (or, upon written request received by OCHAMPUS during the 30 daysand for good cause shown, within 60 days) from the date on the notice witheither: (<T3>1</T3>) Documentary evidence and written argument contesting the proposedaction; or, (<T3>2</T3>) A written request to present in person evidence or argumentto the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. All such presentations shallbe made at the Office of the Civilian Health and Medical Program of theUniformed Services (OCHAMPUS) in Aurora, Colorado, at the provider's ownexpense. (3) <T3>Initial determination.</T3> (i) If, after the provider has exhausted,or failed to comply with, the procedures specified in paragraph (h)(2)of this section, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, decides to invokean administrative remedy of exclusion, suspension, or termination of aprovider under CHAMPUS, written notice of the decision will be sent tothe provider by certified mail. Except in those cases where the sanctionhas a retroactive effective date, the written notice shall be dated nolater than 15 days before the decision becomes effective. For terminationsunder paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the initial determinationmay be issued without first implementing or exhausting the procedures specifiedin paragraph (h)(2) of this section. (ii) The initial determination shall include: (A) A statement of the sanction being invoked; (B) A statement of the effective date of the sanction; (C) A statement of the facts, circumstances, or actions which form thebasis for the sanction and a discussion of any information submitted bythe provider relevant to the sanction; (D) A statement of the factors considered in determining the period ofsanction; (E) The earliest date on which a request for reinstatement under CHAMPUSwill be accepted; (F) The requirements and procedures for reinstatement; and, (G) Notice of the available hearing upon request of the sanctioned provider.(4) <T3>Reinstatement procedures.</T3>_(i) <T3>Restitution.</T3> (A) There is no entitlement under CHAMPUS for payment(cost-sharing) of any claim that involves either criminal or civil fraudas defined by law, or fraud or abuse or conflict of interest as definedby this part. In addition, except as specifically provided in this part,there is no entitlement under CHAMPUS for payment (cost-sharing) of anyclaim for services or supplies furnished by a provider who does not meetthe requirements to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider. In any of the situationsdescribed above, CHAMPUS payment shall be denied whether the claim is submittedby the provider as a participating claim or by the beneficiary for reimbursement.If an erroneous payment has been issued in any such case, collection ofthe payment will be processed under andSection; 199.11 of this part. (B) If the Government has made erroneous payments to a provider becauseof claims involving fraud, abuse, or conflicts of interest, restitutionof the erroneous payments shall be made before a request for reinstatementas a CHAMPUS authorized provider will be considered. Without restitutionor resolution of the debt under andSection; 199.11 of this part, a providershall not be reinstated as an authorized CHAMPUS provider. This is notan appealable issue under andSection; 199.10 of this part. (C) For purposes of authorization as a CHAMPUS provider, a provider whois excluded or suspended under this andSection; 199.9 and who submits participatingclaims for services furnished on or after the effective date of the exclusionor suspension is considered to have forfeited or waived any right or entitlementto bill the beneficiary for the care involved in the claims. Similarly,because a provider is expected to know the CHAMPUS requirements for qualificationas an authorized provider, any participating provider who fails to meetthe qualification requirements for CHAMPUS is considered to have forfeitedor waived any right or entitlement to bill the beneficiary for the careinvolved in the CHAMPUS claims. If, in either situtation, the providerbills the beneficiary, restitution to the beneficiary may be required bythe Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, as a condition for considerationof reinstatement as a CHAMPUS authorized provider.(ii) <T3>Terminated providers.</T3> A terminated provider who subsequently achievesthe minimum qualifications to be an authorized CHAMPUS provider or whohas had his/her license reinstated or the impediment to reinstatement removedby the appropriate licensing jurisdiction may submit a written requestfor reinstatement under CHAMPUS to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.If restitution or proper reinstatement of license is not at issue, theDirector, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, will process the request for reinstatementunder the procedures established for initial requests for authorized CHAMPUSprovider status. (iii) <T3>Providers (other than entities) excluded or suspended under CHAMPUS.</T3>(A) A provider excluded or suspended from CHAMPUS (other than an entityexcluded under andSection; 199.9(f)(1)(i)) may seek reinstatement by submittinga written request to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, any time afterthe date specified in the notice of exclusion or suspension or any earlierdate specified in an appeal decision issued in the provider's appeal underandSection; 199.10 of this part. The request for reinstatement shall include:(<T3>1</T3>) Documentation sufficient to establish the provider's qualificationsunder this part to be a CHAMPUS authorized provider; (<T3>2</T3>) A statement from the provider setting forth the reasons whythe provider should be reinstated, accompanied by written statements fromprofessional associates, peer review bodies, and/or probation officers(if appropriate), attesting to their belief that the violations that ledto exclusion or suspension will not be repeated. (B) A provider entity excluded from CHAMPUS under andSection; 199.9(f)(1)(i)may seek reinstatement by submitting a written request to the Director,OCHAMPUS, or a designee, with documentation sufficient to establish theprovider's qualifications under this Part to be a CHAMPUS authorized providerand either: (<T3>1</T3>) Documentation showing the CHAMPUS reinstatement of the excludedindividual provider whose conviction led to the CHAMPUS exclusion or suspensionof the provider entity; <T3>or</T3> (<T3>2</T3>) Documentation acceptable to the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee,that shows that the individual whose conviction led to the entity's exclusion:(<T3>i</T3>) Has reduced his or her ownership or control interest in theentity below 5 percent; or (<T3>ii</T3>) Is no longer an officer, director, agent or managing employeeof the entity; or (<T3>iii</T3>) Continues to maintain a 5 percent or more ownership or controlinterest in such entity, and that the entity due to circumstances beyondits control, is unable to obtain a divestiture.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> Under paragraph (h)(4)(iii)(B)(<T3>2</T3>) of this section, the request for reinstatement may be submittedany time prior to the date specified in the notice of exclusion or suspensionor an earlier date specified in the appeal decision issued under andSection;199.10 of this part.</ITAG>(<T3>iv</T3>) <T3>Action on request for reinstatement.</T3> In order to reinstate a provideras a CHAMPUS authorized provider, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee,must determine that: (A) The provider meets all requirements under this part to be an authorizedCHAMPUS provider; (B) No additional criminal, civil, or administrative action has been takenor is being considered which could subject the provider to exclusion, suspension,or termination under this section; (C) In the case of a provider entity, verification has been made of thedivestiture or termination of the owner, controlling party, officer, director,agent or managing employee whose conviction led to the entity's exclusion,<T3>or</T3> that the provider entity should be reinstated because the entity,due to circumstances beyond its control, cannot obtain a divestiture ofthe 5 percent or more ownership or controlling interest by the convictedparty.(v) <T3>Notice of action on request for reinstatement_</T3>(A) <T3>Notice of approval of request. </T3>If the Director, OCHAMPUS, or adesignee, approves the request for reinstatement, he or she will: (<T3>1</T3>) Give written notice to the sanctioned party specifying thedate when the authorized provider status under CHAMPUS may resume; and(<T3>2</T3>) Give notice to those agencies and groups that were originallynotified, in accordance with andSection; 199.9(k), of the imposition of thesanction. General notice may also be given to beneficiaries and other partiesas deemed appropriate by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (B) <T3>Notice of denial of request. </T3>If the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee,does not approve the request for reinstatement, written notice will begiven to the provider. If established procedures for processing initialrequests for authorized provider status are used to review the requestfor reinstatement, the established procedures may be used to provide thenotice that the provider does not meet requirements of this part for suchstatus. If the provider continues to be excluded, suspended, or terminatedunder the provisions of this section, the procedures set forth in thisparagraph (h) may be followed in denying the provider's request for reinstatement.(5) <T3>Reversed or vacated convictions or civil judgments involving CHAMPUSfraud. </T3>(i) If a CHAMPUS provider is excluded or suspended <T3>solely </T3>on the basis of a criminal conviction or civil judgmentinvolving a CHAMPUS fraud and the conviction or judgment is reversed orvacated on appeal, CHAMPUS will void the exclusion of a provider. Suchaction will not preclude the initiation of additional independent administrativeaction under this section or any other administrative remedy based on thesame facts or events which were the subject of the criminal convictionor civil judgment. (ii) If an exclusion is voided under paragraph (h)(5)(i) of this section,CHAMPUS will make payment, either to the provider or the beneficiary (ifthe claim was not a participating claim) for otherwise authorized servicesunder CHAMPUS that are furnished or performed during the period of exclusion.(iii) CHAMPUS will also void the exclusion of any entity that was excludedunder andSection; 199.9(f)(1)(i) based <T3>solely </T3>on an individual's conviction that has been reversed orvacated on appeal. (iv) When CHAMPUS voids the exclusion of a provider or an entity, noticewill be given to the agencies and others that were originally notified,in accordance with andSection; 199.9(k). (i) <T3>Evidence required for determinations to invoke administrative remedies_</T3>(1)<T3>General. </T3>Any relevant evidence may be used by the Director, OCHAMPUS,or a designee, if it is the type of evidence on which reasonable personsare accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless ofthe existence of any common law or statutory rule that might make improperthe admission of such evidence over objection in civil or criminal courts.(2) <T3>Types of evidence. </T3>The types of evidence which the Director, OCHAMPUS,or a designee, may rely on in reaching a determination to invoke administrativeremedies under this section include but are not limited to the following:(i) Results of audits conducted by or on behalf of the Government. Suchaudits can include the results of 100 percent review of claims and relatedrecords or a statistically valid sample audit of the claims or records.A statistical sampling shall constitute <T3>prima facie </T3>evidence of the number and amount of claims and theinstances of fraud, abuse, or conflict of interest. (ii) Reports, including sanction reports, from various sources includinga peer review organization (PRO) for the area served by the provider; stateor local licensing or certification authorities; peer or medical reviewconsultants of the Government, including consultants for Government contractors;state or local professional societies; or other sources deemed appropriateby the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee. (iii) Orders or documents issued by Federal, state, foreign, or other courtsof competent jurisdiction which issue findings and/or criminal convictionsor civil judgments involving the provider, and administrative rulings,findings, or determinations by any agency of the Federal Government, astate, or local licensing or certification authority regarding the provider'sstatus with that agency or authority. (j) <T3>Suspending Administrative Action. </T3>(1) All or any administrativeaction may be suspended by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, pendingaction in the case by the Department of Defense_Inspector General, DefenseCriminal Investigative Service, or the Department of Justice (includingthe responsible United States Attorney). However, action by the Departmentof Defense_Inspector General or the Department of Justice, including investigation,criminal prosecution, or civil litigation, does not preclude administrativeaction by OCHAMPUS. (2) The normal OCHAMPUS procedure is to suspend action on the administrativeprocess pending an investigation by the Department of Defense_InspectorGeneral or final disposition by the Department of Justice.(3) Though OCHAMPUS administrative action is taken independently of anyaction by the Department of Defense-Inspector General or by the Departmentof Justice, once a case is forwarded to the Department of Defense-InspectorGeneral or the Department of Justice for legal action (criminal or civil),administrative action may be held in abeyance. (4) In some instances there may be dual jurisdiction between agencies;as in, for example, the joint regulations issued by the Department of Justiceand the Government Accounting Office regarding debt collection. (k) <T3>Notice to Other Agencies.</T3> (1) When CHAMPUS excludes, suspends,or terminates a provider, the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, will notifyother appropriate agencies (for example, the Department of Health and HumanServices and the state licensing agency that issued the provider's licenseto practice) that the individual has been excluded, suspended, or terminatedas an authorized provider under CHAMPUS. An exclusion, suspension, or terminationaction is considered a public record. Such notice can include the noticesand determinations sent to the suspended provider and other public documentssuch as testimony given at a hearing or exhibits or depositions given ina lawsuit or hearing. Notice may also be given to Uniformed Services MilitaryTreatment Facilities, Health Benefit Advisors, beneficiaries and sponsors,the news media, and institutional providers if inpatient care was involved.(2) If CHAMPUS has temporarily suspended claims processing, notice of suchaction normally will be given to the affected provider and Uniformed ServicesMedical Treatment Facilities, Health Benefits Advisors, beneficiaries,and sponsors. Notice may also be given to any information or news mediaand any other individual, professional provider, or institutional provider,as deemed appropriate. However, since a ``temporary suspension of claimsprocessing'' is by definition not a final or formal agency action, thebasis for the action generally will not be disclosed. It is noted thatthe basis for the action can be a result of questions arising from routineaudits to investigation of possible criminal violations. (l) <T3>Compromise, Settlement, and Resolution Authority.</T3> (1) In lieuof invoking any remedy provided by this Section, the Director, OCHAMPUS,or a designee, may elect to enter into an agreement with the provider intendedto correct the situation within an established time period and subjectto any remedies deemed appropriate by the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee.(2) When it is in the best interest of CHAMPUS, the Director, OCHAMPUS,has the discretionary authority to waive an action or enter into compromiseor settlement of administrative actions taken under this andSection; 199.9.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>6. Section 199.10 is amended by revising paragraph (a), paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A),(a)(1)(i)(B), (a)(1)(i)(C), and (a)(1)(ii); redesignating previous (a)(2)(i)(B)through (a)(2)(i)(D) as (a)(2)(i)(C) through (a)(2)(i)(E); adding new paragraph(a)(2)(i)(B); revising paragraph (a)(3); redesignating previous paragraphs(a)(4) through (a)(7) as paragraphs (a)(5) through (a)(8); adding new paragraph(a)(4); revising (a)(5), revising paragraphs (a)(6)(iv)(A) and (a)(6)(iv)(C);adding new paragraph (a)(6)(v); revising paragraphs (a)(7)(iii), (a)(7)(iv)(C),(a)(8)(i)(A), and (a)(8)(ii)(A); by adding a new paragraph (a)(9); by revisingparagraphs (b), (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(iv), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4)introductory text, (c), (c)(2), (c)(5)(i) and (ii), (d), (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(iii),(d)(2), (d)(9)(iii)(A), (d)(9)(iv)(C) and (d)(9)(iv)(D); by removing paragraphs(d)(10)(ii) and (d)(10)(iv); by adding a new paragraph (d)(10)(ii); byremoving paragraph (d)(11)(iii); and by redesignating the previous paragraphs(d)(11)(iv), (d)(11)(v), (d)(11)(vi), (d)(11)(vii), (d)(11)(viii), (d)(11)(ix),(d)(11)(x), (d)(11)(xi), (d)(11)(xii), and (d)(11)(xiii) as subparagraphs(d)(11)(iii), (d)(11)(iv), (d)(11)(v), (d)(11)(vi), (d)(11)(vii), (d)(11)(viii),(d)(11)(ix), (d)(11)(x) (revising paragraph (d)(11)(x)(A)), and the headingof (d)(11)(xi). <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 199.10</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Appeal and hearing procedures. </ITAG>(a) <T3>General.</T3> This Section sets forth the policies and procedures forappealing decisions made by OCHAMPUS, OCHAMPUSEUR, and CHAMPUS contractorsadversely affecting the rights and liabilities of CHAMPUS beneficiaries,CHAMPUS participating providers, and providers denied the status of authorizedprovider under CHAMPUS. An appeal under CHAMPUS is an administrative reviewof program determinations made under the provisions of law and regulation.An appeal cannot challenge the propriety, equity, or legality of any provisionof law or regulation. (1) * * * (i) * * * (A) OCHAMPUS, OCHAMPUSEUR, and CHAMPUS contractors shall mail notices ofinitial determinations to the affected provider or CHAMPUS beneficiary(or representative) at the last known address. For beneficiaries who areunder 18 years of age or who are incompetent, a notice issued to the parent,guardian, or other representative, under established CHAMPUS procedures,constitutes notice to the beneficiary. (B) CHAMPUS contractors and OCHAMPUSEUR shall notify a provider of an initialdetermination on a claim only if the provider participated in the claim.(See andSection; 199.7 of this part.) (C) Notice of an initial determination on a claim processed by a CHAMPUScontractor or OCHAMPUSEUR normally will be made on a CHAMPUS Explanationof Benefits (CEOB) form. (D) * * * (E) * * * (ii) <T3>Effect of initial determination.</T3> The initial determination isfinal, unless appealed in accordance with this Section, or unless the initialdetermination is reopened by OCHAMPUS or the CHAMPUS contractor.(2) * * * (i) * * * (B) A beneficiary who has an interest in receiving care or has receivedcare from a particular provider cannot be an appealing party regardingthe exclusion, suspension, or termination of the provider under andSection;199.9 of this part. <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(3) <T3>Burden of proof. </T3>The burden of proof is on the appealing partyto establish affirmatively by substantial evidence the appealing party'sentitlement under law and this part to the authorization of CHAMPUS benefits,approval of authorized CHAMPUS provider status, or removal of sanctionsimposed under andSection; 199.9 of this part. If a presumption exists underthe provisions of this part or information constitutes <T3>prima facie </T3>evidence under the provisions of this part, the appealingparty must produce evidence reasonably sufficient to rebut the presumptionor <T3>prima facie </T3>evidence as part of the appealing party's burden ofproof. CHAMPUS shall not pay any part of the cost or fee, including attorneyfees, associated with producing or submitting evidence in support of anappeal. (4) <T3>Evidence in appeal and hearing cases. </T3>Any relevant evidence maybe used in the administrative appeal and hearing process if it is the typeof evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conductof serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutoryrule that might make improper the admission of such evidence over objectionin civil or criminal courts. (5) <T3>Late filing. </T3>If a request for reconsideration, formal review,or hearings is filed after the time permitted in this section, writtennotice shall be issued denying the request. Late filing may be permittedonly if the appealing party reasonably can demonstrate to the satisfactionof the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, that the timely filing of therequest was not feasible due to extraordinary circumstances over whichthe appealing party had no practical control. Each request for an exceptionto the filing requirement will be considered on its own merits. The decisionof the Director, OCHAMPUS, or a designee, on the request for an exceptionto the filing requirement shall be final. (6) <T3>Appealable issue.</T3> * * * (i) * * * (iv) * * * (A) Determination of a person's eligibility as a CHAMPUS beneficiary isthe responsibility of the appropriate Uniformed Service. Although OCHAMPUS,OCHAMPUSEUR, and CHAMPUS contractors must make determinations concerninga beneficiary's eligibility in order to ensure proper disbursement of appropriatedfunds on each CHAMPUS claim processed, ultimate responsibility for resolvinga beneficiary's eligibility rests with the Uniformed Services. Accordingly,disputed question of fact concerning a beneficiary's eligibility will notbe considered an appealable issue under the provisions of this section,but shall be resolved in accordance with andSection; 199.3 of this part.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(C) Any sanction, including the period of the sanction, imposed under andSection;199.9 of this part which is based solely on a provider's exclusion or suspensionby another agency of the Federal Government, a state, or a local licensingauthority is not appealable under this section. The provider must exhaustadministrative appeal rights offered by the other agency that made theinitial determination to exclude or suspend the provider. Similarly, anysanction imposed under andSection; 199.9 which is based solely on a criminalconviction or civil judgment against the provider is not appealable underthis section. If the sanction imposed under andSection; 199.9 is not basedsolely on the provider's criminal conviction or civil judgment or on theprovider's exclusion or suspension by another agency of the Federal Government,a state, or a local licensing authority, that portion of the CHAMPUS administrativedetermination which is in addition to the criminal conviction/civil judgmentor exclusion/suspension by the other agency may be appealed under thissection.
