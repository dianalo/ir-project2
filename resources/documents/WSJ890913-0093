The 380-38 vote came after House Speaker Thomas Foley assured proponents of a constitutional amendment barring physical attacks on the flag that he would schedule a House vote on it later this year if the statute passed.    Republican lawmakers were upset that the measure was considered under a House procedure that precluded any attempts to either alter the statute or offer a constitutional amendment in its place. The method requires a two-thirds majority, and House Republicans had threatened to withhold support to force a vote on an amendment.    Only a handful of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans voted against the measure.    Before the vote, Mr. Foley assured House GOP Leader Robert Michel of Illinois and G.V. &quot;Sonny&quot; Montgomery (D., Miss.), chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, that if the statute is enacted, the House would vote on a proposed constitutional amendment the two men are sponsoring. Rep. Foley opposes the amendment.    A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate and the approval of 38 of the 50 state legislatures.    The Senate is to vote on a statute protecting the flag and on a constitutional amendment by mid-October. Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on an amendment are to begin today. Mr. Foley said the House vote would come after the Senate action.    As wary as Speaker Foley is of tampering with the First Amendment, he is also aware of the political risks in blocking a vote on a constitutional amendment. &quot;We're against it, but we're not going to use the scheduling of the House as a weapon,&quot; said an aide to the Washington state Democrat.    In a statement, the Bush administration reiterated its support for a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning. The administration labeled the bill &quot;merely a symbolic gesture and not a serious effort to provide real protection for the flag.&quot; Talk of a presidential veto is &quot;premature,&quot; according to White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.    Democrats are still angry and nervous over the way President Bush used the flag to associate himself with patriotic values in last year's presidential campaign and are fearful of being driven into the same corner that Michael Dukakis found himself on the Pledge of Allegiance issue.    The House-passed measure would make it a crime for anyone to &quot;knowingly mutilate, deface, burn or trample upon&quot; a flag, punishable by as long as one year in jail and an unspecified fine. An exception would be made for disposing of a worn or soiled flag.    Currently, federal law makes it a crime to &quot;knowingly cast contempt&quot; upon a flag by &quot;publicly mutilating, defacing, defiling, burning or trampling upon it&quot; and provides penalties of as long as a year in jail and a fine of as much as $1,000.    In June, the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration. The court said he was &quot;engaging in political expression&quot; that is protected by the First Amendment. By dropping the phrase &quot;cast contempt,&quot; proponents of the legislation believe it would avoid the court's objection by targeting an action rather than the intent behind it. </TEXT></DOC>
