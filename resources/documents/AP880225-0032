Robertson said Wednesday his Christian Broadcasting Network onceknew the whereabouts of American hostages in Lebanon ``and theycould have been freed.'' Robertson spokesmen later said the theformer television evangelist was referring to hostages seized whena TWA flight was hijacked to Beirut in 1985, who were eventuallyfreed.   When he was asked about Robertson's assertion, Reagan said hedidn't want to comment on the campaign. But he said of thehostages: ``We have tried our best and through every kind ofchannel to establish their whereabouts because that's the beginningof efforts to try and get them free.''   ``If he thought that he knew'' where hostages were being held,Reagan said of Robertson, ``he kept it to himself.''   ``It's very frustrating to try and establish a location,'' saidthe president. ``But we've never let up, and we never will, intrying to obtain the freedom of all the hostages.''   Nine Americans are in captivity in Lebanon, including Marine Lt.Col. William R. Higgins, who was captured last week. TerryAnderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,is the longest-held captive, having been kidnapped on March 16,1985.   Robertson spokesman Scott Hatch said after Reagan spoke: ``Ithink what Pat said was accurate.''   Even before the president's news conference, Robertson'scomments drew quick criticism from two of his GOP presidentialrivals, Rep. Jack Kemp and Vice President George Bush.   Kemp, in a statement, called Robertson's statementsirresponsible and said he should ``apologize to the families of thehostages whom he has needlessly hurt in an attempt to gainpublicity.''   ``I don't think it was irresponsible at all,'' said Hatch. ``Thewhole context was how Pat would deal with terrorism, and he usedthat as an example.''   Bush, campaigning in Boston, said: ``My question would be, howcome he didn't get hold of the proper authorities in the UnitedStates government that were working day and night, trying to figureout how they could get these people out?''   Robertson's comments came at an Atlanta news conference duringwhich he complained that U.S. intelligence in the Middle East isinadequate and declared that action must be quick when Americansare taken hostage.   ``We identified in our news department at CBN the location ofthose hostages in Lebanon very shortly after they were taken, andthey were in a position where they could have been rescued,'' hesaid.   ``They were in Beirut, and they could have been freed.''   Robertson did not provide specifics and did not say whichhostages were involved.   Benton Miller, spokesman for CBN, based in Virginia Beach, Va.,said the comments pertained to hostages who had been taken from TWAFlight 847 in 1985. He later issued a synopsis of the news reportto which Robertson referred.   The synopsis said that in response to a question from Robertson,a CBN Middle East correspondent, who was not named, said thehostages, ``are in several locations in and around Lebanon and wehave also learned that maybe at least one of them, and we do notknow which one, but we have been told by intelligence sources inLebanon, that at least one may be being held in Tehran.''   The suspicion concerning the hostage thought to be held inTehran was later reported as incorrect in a subsequent news reporton Robertson's ``700 Club'' talk show, Miller said.   Asked whether he had told the Reagan administration what heknew, Robertson said, ``I broadcast it on national television; theymonitor our programs virtually every day.''   Robertson aide Gary Lane said during the TWA hostage situation,the State Department contacted CBN for information at that time,but he said he did not know exactly who made the contact.   A State Department terrorism expert said he was puzzled byRobertson's statements, saying he was unaware that CBN had everbroadcast the precise locations of any hostages.   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also saidknowledge of hostages' whereabouts in terms of a particular city oreven a section of a city wouldn't be enough to mount a rescuemission.   Robertson's comments on the hostages marked the second time intwo weeks that his statements on international matters have sparkedcontroversy. During a Republican presidential debate on Feb. 14, healleged that the Soviets have nuclear missiles in Cuba, pointing tothe United States. The Reagan administration denied it.   In yet another controversy, Bush asked Robertson to apologize orprovide proof to back up his suggestion on Tuesday thatanti-Robertson political motivations were behind the timing ofpublic allegations of sexual misconduct against televisionevangelist Jimmy Swaggart.   ``By sundown in the old South, I'd like to see him stand up likea Southern gentleman with a little evidence,'' Bush said. ``I'dlike to see an apology or proof.''</TEXT></DOC>
