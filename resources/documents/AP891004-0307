The International Association of Machinists and AerospaceWorkers had repeatedly expressed its opposition to the proposedleveraged buyout of Chicago-based UAL Corp. by its employees andmanagement, saying it could endanger the nation's second-largestairline. But it had not issued a formal answer until theannouncement from vice president John Peterpaul.   ``After a thorough study of the proposed plan and after meetingwith company officials, the IAM will go forth with normalnegotiations as it would with any other carrier,'' Peterpaul said.``We do not feel that IAM members' interest would be well served byparticipating in the ESOP (employee stock ownership plan) program.''   The Machinists union represents 25,000 of UAL's 70,000employees. Its contract becomes amendable at the end of this month.   United said in a statement that the Machinists' decision wasconsistent with its ``previously announced and often repeatedposition.''   But the company said the IAM decision ``does not change thebenefits that flow to United's employees from ownership of theircompany _ benefits we hope will be shared by all employees.''   And the company indicated it would continue to woo Machinistsmembers, saying ``we would welcome the participation of ouremployees represented by the IAM, and are prepared to continue toexplore ways to achieve that objective.''   The $300-a-share plan calls for UAL workers to own 75 percent ofthe company. A management group headed by UAL Chairman Stephen M.Wolf would own 10 percent and the remaining 15 percent would beheld by British Airways PLC.   The total cost of the buyout, including financing charges, couldreach $9.45 billion, according to documents filed with theSecurities and Exchange Commission by pilots and management.</TEXT></DOC>
