For most practical purposes it is important that the radiationsource is of small extension. Such a radiation source is realized bymeans of a beam optical system that includes two scanning magnets eachof which admits scanning of the particle beam in one of two orthogonalplanes. The beam scanned in one of the planes leaves the associated scanningmagnet from an effective scanning centre. The optical system also includesa deflection magnet disposed between the scanning magnets for deflectingthe path of the beam in space. By utilizing the optical properties ofthe deflection magnet in such a way that the deflection magnet producesan image of the effective scanning centre of the first scanning magnetwhich coincides with the effective scanning centre of the second scanningmagnet, the beam scanned in two orthogonal planes will radiate isotropicallyfrom the scanning centre of the second scanning magnet. By using thedeflection magnet a compact scanning system with a small distance betweenthe scanning centres of the scanning magnets is obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
