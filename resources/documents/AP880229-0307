Some major computer companies had charged that ATandamp;T was playingfavorites by giving early information about future versions of Unixto Sun Microsystems Inc., a Silicon Valley maker of engineeringworkstations that is a close partner of ATandamp;T.   ``People have had a big misconception about what the nature ofthe agreement has been,'' Bill Klinger, an ATandamp;T executive in chargeof Unix product management, said in an interview.   Klinger said it would be a mistake for ATandamp;T to play favoritesbecause that would delay the spread of Unix, an operating systemthat is used mainly for scientific and engineering work.   Motorola Inc. said Monday that the London-based UniSoft Group,working closely with ATandamp;T, would work to make sure that Unix runson computers that contain microprocessors made by Motorola.   ``Combined with ATandamp;T's support, this will ensure Motorola'scustomers the same full and timely access as early as anycompetitive architecture,'' Gary Tooker, Motorola's chief operatingofficer, said in a news release.   Motorola claims that 80 percent of all Unix-based computerprograms run on computers containing its microprocessors.   Motorola's goal is to have programs run without modification onany computer that uses one of its microprocessors.</TEXT></DOC>
