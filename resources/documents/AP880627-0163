But Savimbi said his first priority is to bring an end to theSoviet-Cuban presence in Angola and to promote a peacefulsettlement to the 13-year civil war in his homeland.   Savimbi, who is on a 10-day good will tour of the United States,spoke at a luncheon sponsored by the newly created CongressionalTask Force on Angola, which supports U.S. goals in the Africannation.   As part of an effort to encourage the withdrawal of Cuban forcesin Angola and to achieve a negotiated settlement with Angola'sMarxist government, the United States has been supplying militaryequipment to Savimbi's UNITA forces for the past several years.   The Angolan government took out an advertisement in Monday'seditions of the New York Times highlighting Savimbi's ties to SouthAfrica, which has been supporting the UNITA war effort. Theadvertisement called Savimbi ``South Africa's Secret Agent.''   But Savimbi said he has been attempting to encourage SouthAfrican President P.W. Botha to release Nelson Mandela, theanti-apartheid black leader who has been imprisoned since the 1960s.   ``We have full sympathy for those fighting for freedom in SouthAfrica,'' Savimbi said.   Savimbi said Cuba has sent an additional 12,000 troops to Angolarecently and has become the ``masters'' of Angola's fate. He saidthe increase has raised the Cuban troop commitment to 57,000. U.S.estimates put the figure at between 43,000 and 45,000.   Savimbi said UNITA requires additional help from the UnitedStates because Angola received $1.5 billion worth of weaponry fromthe Soviet Union last year.   ``There is no sign they are going to decrease,'' Savimbi said.   Last week, the United States welcomed indications from theAngolan government that it was not demanding a cessation of U.S.support for UNITA in return for serious negotiations for a peacesettlement.   Officials from the United States, Angola, Cuba and South Africamet last week for a second time to explore the prospects for anegotiated peace. The U.S. position has been that aid to UNITA isnot an appropriate topic for discussion in the talks.</TEXT></DOC>
