SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Much of the GI generation that fought in WorldWar II and returned home to create an economic and baby boom isretiring in relative comfort, a Florida researcher reports.   More than half of retirees age 65 to 74 have income at doublethe poverty level, and 12 percent form an elite with income from atleast three sources, according to Charles F. Longino of theUniversity of Miami.   But elderly affluence isn't spread evenly across the nation,Longino reports in the June edition of American Demographicsmagazine.   ``There are a cluster of states with a large share of thecomfortably retired,'' Longino said in analyzing 1980 Census data,the most recent information available with sufficient detail forthe study.   Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada and New Jersey had many ofthe comfortably retired, while the pension elite made strongshowings in Connecticut and Washington, Longino found.   The poverty level for a family of four was $8,414 in 1980.   The World War II GIs reaped the benefits of government programsthat provided educations and home loans, cost-of-living escalatorsfor their Social Security benefits and federal laws protectingprivate pensions, Longino noted. In addition, many were able toinvest in stocks and bonds in a time of booming economy.   Longino looked at three groups of retirees in his study, thoseaged 55 to 64, 65-74 and 75 and over in 1980. He termed them the GIgeneration after the term ``Government Issue,'' which became apopular for soldiers in the 1940s.   Just over half (51.1 percent) of those in the 65-74 age groupwere listed as comfortable, and 12.3 percent were in the eliteelite.''   For the younger group, 59.1 percent were comfortable and 4.7percent were in the elite. They were less likely to qualify aselite since few were receiving Social Security in addition to otherretirement benefits.   The oldest group listed 37.5 percent as comfortable and 8.5percent as elite. Few in this group had income-generating assetsand most completed a large share of their working lives beforeWorld War II, when pension benefits were less common and lower.   Longino found the confortably retired of the 65-74 age group insuch resort and retirement states as Florida, Nevada and NewJersey; in Connecticut, where many New York executives haveretired, and Hawaii.   Hawaii has a large Asian population where extended families aremore common, a situation which boosts the household income measureused as the basis for this calculation, Longino noted.   For the pension elite, Connecticut and Washington placed well,as did Florida, Maryland, New Jersey. Longino also noted that thereare clusters of affluent elderly in some metropolitan areas.   He cited as examples Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Fla.; SanDiego and Palm Springs, Calif.; and along the east coast of MobileBay, Ala.   Longino is director of the Center for Social Research in Agingat the University of Miami, and his work was partially funded bythe American Association of Retired Persons. American Demographics,published by Dow Jones andamp; Co. Inc., reports on population matters.   Here is a state-by-state rundown of the percentage of Americansaged 65-74 who are considered confortably retired, or among thepension elite.   Comfortably retired (CR) is defined as having income of twicethe poverty level. Pension elite (PE) means receiving from threesources: Social Security, pensions and assets.</TEXT><TEXT>   State           CR  PEUnited States  51.1 12.3Alabama        35.4  7.2Alaska         59.3 10.4Arizona        59.8 16.2Arkansas       36.6  8.3California     59.7 15.2Colorado       55.8 14.0Connecticut    62.7 18.5Delaware       56.9 16.0Dist. of Col.  55.3 12.3Florida        61.0 15.7Georgia        39.2  7.4Hawaii         64.0 14.6Idaho          48.9 10.5Illinois       58.6 14.5Indiana        54.1 15.4Iowa           55.0 10.8Kansas         53.9 11.0Kentucky       39.9  9.1Louisiana      38.5  6.7Maine          45.5 12.9Maryland       59.8 16.3Massachusetts  54.6 14.3Michigan       54.5 16.2Minnesota      50.6 12.7Mississippi    30.5  5.0Missouri       48.6 12.2Montana        47.5  9.6Nebraska       51.7  8.2Nevada         60.6 12.3New Hampshire  51.8 15.3New Jersey     61.6 16.5New Mexico     48.1 11.4New York       55.0 15.5North Carolina 39.4  8.0North Dakota   47.6  7.4Ohio           55.2 16.2Oklahoma       42.5  8.9Oregon         56.5 16.3Pennsylvania   55.3 16.8Rhode Island   51.4 13.9South Carolina 40.0  8.3South Dakota   42.6  6.6Tennessee      39.2  8.8Texas          46.1  9.5Utah           59.3 13.0Vermont        50.3 15.5Virginia       52.8 12.5Washington     58.9 18.2West Virginia  45.5 11.6Wisconsin      54.4 16.2Wyoming        52.4  9.3</TEXT></DOC>
