The Resolution Trust Corp., the new agency created to dispose offailed thrifts, has sold only 50 of the more than 380 Sandamp;Ls undergovernment control and ``is not living up to expectations,'' Dolesaid.   He said the delay is driving up the cost of the bailout,estimated at $160 billion over 10 years.   ``We've got to get this thing going... I've got a feeling thisthing is going to get out of hand one of these days and theAmerican people are going to start saying, `What are you doingabout it?''' he told a meeting of the National Association ofFederal Credit Unions.   The Republican leader said the administration must fill vacantpositions in the savings and loan bureaucracy and resolve anapparent turf battle between the Resolution Trust Corp. and aTreasury Department-led oversight board.   And Congress must ``go back and take a look'' at Sandamp;L legislation``if not this year, then early next year,'' he said. The chairmenof both the House and Senate banking committees say they opposerevising the law this year.   But Dole said the Sandamp;L law contributes to what he called asluggishness that is gripping the bureaucracy by establishingconflicting guidelines.   Congress ordered the administration to dispose of property fromSandamp;Ls quickly but avoid dumping property on the market. It said thegovernment should get the highest price for the assets but offerlow-income groups the first chance to buy some of the property.   As a result, ``the RTC is timid,'' Dole said. ``They're afraidof Congress. They're afraid of public hearings. They don't want todo anything innovative.''   ``We (in Congress) are trying to have it both ways,'' he said.``... Keep this in mind because, a year from now, nobody inCongress is going to tell you we did that. They're going to blamethe administration.''   Dole said he's sounded his warning in a conversation with thepresident, in a letter to Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady andin a meeting last week with White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.</TEXT></DOC>
