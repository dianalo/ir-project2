Stewart and Daniel Hertzberg (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> JUS </G><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Government prosecutors are asking for an extension of a Tuesday deadline to obtain an indictment of arbitrager John A. Mulheren Jr., people familiar with the case said.    Government prosecutors would prefer delaying the case to avoid exposing their star witness, imprisoned former takeover speculator Ivan F. Boesky, to premature cross-examination, the people said. Mr. Boesky is expected to be a crucial witness in many cases besides that of Mr. Mulheren.    Nonetheless, the government is ready to go forward if Mr. Mulheren turns down their request for more time. Mr. Boesky has been testifying about Mr. Mulheren before a federal grand jury in New York this week in anticipation of a government request for an indictment, people familiar with the case said.    If the government succeeds in obtaining an indictment, Mr. Mulheren is expected to be charged with interference with a witness in a federal case, and weapons and securities-law violations, people familiar with the case said. As previously reported, the government has been investigating whether Mr. Mulheren took stock positions for Mr. Boesky, to conceal the true ownership of the securities. Mr. Mulheren last February allegedly threatened the lives of Mr. Boesky and Mr. Boesky's former head trader, Michael Davidoff.    Under the Speedy Trial Act, Mr. Mulheren has a right to an indictment within 30 days of his arrest, unless he agrees to extensions. Mr. Mulheren was arrested in February near his home while carrying a loaded assault rifle, after he reportedly told police he planned to kill Mr. Boesky and Mr. Davidoff, both potential witnesses against him.    Since then Mr. Mulheren has granted government requests for more time, but people close to him said he may refuse the latest request. If he does refuse, the government must either obtain an indictment from a grand jury hearing evidence in the case by Tuesday, or drop the charges. In most cases, even if the government drops charges, it is free to seek a new indictment later.    Whether the Mulheren case goes forward next week has wide significance for the government's massive insider-trading investigation. Mr. Mulheren's case could become the first contested case arising from the investigation to proceed to a trial in which Mr. Boesky appears as a witness.    Defense lawyers for a wide range of targets in the government's investigation are eager for the chance to cross-examine Mr. Boesky, and how he performs on the witness stand will be of crucial importance in any case where he is expected to be a witness. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and its head of junk-bond trading, Michael Milken, have publicly criticized government allegations against them as relying exclusively on information supplied by Mr. Boesky.    Mr. Mulheren's lawyer, Thomas Puccio, declined to comment. If the Mulheren case does go forward, Mr. Puccio, a partner at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley andamp; McCloy, would likely become the first defense lawyer to cross-examine Mr. Boesky, a role that would guarantee Mr. Puccio enormous media attention.    In April, when Mr. Puccio replaced Mr. Mulheren's previous lawyer, he asserted Mr. Mulheren's innocence and ruled out the possibility of any plea bargaining. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, which is handling the case, declined to comment.    Mr. Boesky, who was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty to one felony, has been in New York's Metropolitan Correction Center this week, the same federal facility where Mr. Mulheren was initially held following his arrest, rather than at the Lompoc, Calif., minimum security facility where Mr. Boesky is serving his sentence. Lawyers for Mr. Boesky declined to comment on his activities in New York, but other people confirmed he is appearing before a grand jury hearing evidence related to Mr. Mulheren.    Mr. Mulheren has been living at his Rumson, N.J., home under court supervision since his release from prison, and received treatment for manic depression at a New Jersey psychiatric facility. </TEXT></DOC>
