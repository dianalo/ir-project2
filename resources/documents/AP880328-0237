(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A drug that could save your life maybe hiding right now in a bit of ordinary seaweed.   So could chemicals that could produce better crops, killdangerous pests or clean toxic wastes. They just haven't beendiscovered yet.   ``We're essentially land creatures. That's why we've focused onland plants. But the sea, chemically, is a very differentenvironment, and you will find many new and different thingsthere,'' said Kenneth Terry, vice president of Ocean Genetics Inc.   The young company 60 miles south of San Francisco wants to bethe first to find, develop and perhaps market some of thepotentially valuable products that may be lurking in seaweed andother forms of marine algae.   In hundreds of glass dishes and flasks in its laboratories orhuge bubbling tanks in seaside greenhouses, Ocean Genetics isgrowing, studying and testing more than 300 species of the simpleplants.   Algae, which range from one-celled organisms to large, familiarseaweeds, already are used to make many things, includingstabilizers, thickeners and texturizers important in the food andcosmetic industries and gels essential to science and medicine.   Two of those gels are agar _ the familiar culture medium inpetri dishes _ and its purer, electrically neutral form, agarose,which is criticial for many research procedures.   There are no substitutes for either, producers are few, anddemand keeps growing. That means a profitable opportunity for OceanGenetics, which plans later this year to market agar and agaroseit's now producing and testing.   ``Agar and agarose provide us with the steppingstone I felt wasnecessary for Ocean Genetics to find and develop other productlines,'' said company president and founder Wayne Harvey.   Those yet-undiscovered products are the primary, thoughlong-term, goal of the company, the company officials said inrecent interviews.   ``The highest potential is for pharmaceutical and animal healthcare products. But I think the potential of agrichemicals, inparticular natural pesticides ... and plant-growth regulators alsoare signficant,'' Harvey said.   Bay Venture Group, which provided Ocean Genetics $200,000 inseed capital when it was formed in 1981 and other financing since,is pleased with the privately-held company's progress and isoptimistic about the future.   ``It has all the characteristics of a successful business,''said BVG general partner Bill Chandler, also a director of OceanGenetics. ``I think the company is going to be a major pioneer.   ``And of course, there's a saying that while pioneers get shotin the back, they also get to claim the new land.''   Once it identifies new chemicals, Ocean Genetics will be able togrow the algae they come from very quickly, Harvey said.   That's primarily because the company combines engineeringknowledge with plant physiology and biochemistry and will avoid``the vagaries of nature'' by raising large monoculture crops ofproven plants in indoor tanks, he said.   But the process begins in a Santa Cruz laboratory filled withhundreds of petri dishes and seething carboys filled with largepieces of brown, red and green algae.   The specimens, collected all over the world, are cleaned andsmall pieces are put in the petri dishes, where they grow forseveral months. Then they are transferred to the carboy containers,where for another six to nine months they are kept in purified,nutrient-rich salt water.   ``Some of them are just incredibly beautiful. Look at the laceof the leaf of this plant,'' said Harvey, displaying a specimenwhose delicate russet network was revealed by the strong lightbehind its container.   ``Once we have found an organism that produces a product, we doextensive studies ... to find out how we can control itsenvironment to maximize the production and the quality of whatwe're interested in,'' Harvey said.   Controlling reproduction, screening cells for mutations andcloning are some of the methods the company can use to increase andimprove desirable qualities, he added.   Ocean Genetics' first research product, phychobiliproteins,already are being produced and tested. The naturally flourescentchemicals found in certain seaweeds can be used in medicine to tagsome types of cells. Someday they may replace radioactive tracersnow used to study and treat diseases like cancer and AIDS, Harveysaid.   ``These little puppies are worth $10,000 to $15,000 a gram ...wholesale,'' he said, holding a test tube of glowing purple liquid.   After growing in the carboys, some plants are freeze-dried andsent to one of several pharmaceutical, chemical or biotechcompanies, which test the samples for possibly valuable substances.   But other promising varieties are ``grown up'' and studiedfurther in several stages in computer-controlled tanks insidegreenhouses on land the company leases from the University ofCalifornia-Santa Cruz, Terry said.   Reaching into one tank, Terry pulls out a handful of materialthat looks like reddish-brown steel wool _ a plant whose origin orpossible future use he and Harvey good-naturedly refuse to reveal.   ``This is a unique opportunity,'' Terry said. ``It's about as ifwe were able to start over on land. The sea is a whole freshresource.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions April 2-3</NOTE></DOC>
