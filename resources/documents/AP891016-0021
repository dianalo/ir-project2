(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Solar Maximum satellite,repaired in a daring space shuttle mission five years ago, isexpected to come crashing back to Earth next month, possibly inthree big chunks.   The satellite's imminent demise comes as the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration is trying to reassure thepublic about the safety of a nuclear-powered probe to be launchedTuesday from the space shuttle Atlantis.   Charles Redmond, spokesman for NASA's science office, said thechances of satellite debris hurting anyone are remote because SolarMax's track takes it over large expanses of ocean and sparselysettled land areas.   ``This is a routine satellite re-entry,'' Redmond said Sunday.Only the largest parts of the satellite are expected to survive theheat created by crashing through the atmosphere: a gyroscopepackage that orients the satellite, a frame for a sun sensor, and adevice that holds parts in place.   Redmond said the satellite will hit the Earth sometime inmid-November, producing up to three 120-pound pieces.   Environmental activists oppose Tuesday's shuttle launch, sayingan accident might release radioactive fuel over parts of Florida.   The Galileo probe, carrying 49.4 pounds of plutonium-238, is tobe released by the five astronauts six hours after launch and senton its six-year journey to Jupiter.   The only portions of the United States under the Solar Maxground track are South Florida, the extreme southern part of Texasand Hawaii. The track also covers much of South America, Africa,India, Australia and the southernmost tip of China.   Solar Max cost $77 million to build and launch in February 1980,at a time of maximum activity in the sun's 11-year sunspot cycle.Its mission was to study solar flares.   But after 10 months of service, three fuses blew in a controlbox and it was unable to point itself accurately. That, in turn,caused four of its seven onboard instruments to fail.   In 1984, the shuttle Challenger pulled alongside the satelliteand astronaut Terry Hart grabbed it with the ship's 50-foot robotarm. At the time, it was called ``the historic first capture of asatellite in orbit for in-flight repair'' and then-President Reagancongratulated the astronauts in an Oval Office-to-Challenger call.   The following day, two astronauts, working in the open cargobay, replaced the satellite's control system module and anelectronics box.   Solar Max has been working well since then. Plans were made fora time to boost it to a higher orbit again, but that would have setback other scheduled missions, and the idea was abandoned, Redmondsaid.   ``It's seen a complete solar cycle,'' he said of the satellite.``Essentially, it's completed its mission.''</TEXT></DOC>
