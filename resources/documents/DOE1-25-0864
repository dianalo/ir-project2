On the R and D of theelement technologies, the cell technology, the overlaying technologyand the fuel reforming equipment were selected, and the search for thecause of deterioration of cell properties, the evaluation on the cellcomposition and the electrode, the test production of the cell with electrodebase plates and the evaluation of the base plate and the study on dynamiccharacteristics of the reforming unit under a varable load were carriedout. Further, on the trial construction of the 1 MW class power plantand operation research, the basic plant specifications and plant componentswere first determined being followed by the detailed design on the powerplant including the process flow, control system and etc. (17 figs)</TEXT></DOC>
