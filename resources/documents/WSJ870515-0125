That doesn't do it for you? Try warmup suits. Or lasers. Or health spas.    Old hat and ho-hum, you say? We agree.    The trick is to turn these hardly original ideas into enterprises that fill needs most consumers don't yet know they have. For in the view of many who advise tomorrow's entrepreneurs, the hottest business opportunities of the 1990s won't necessarily be the latest.    &quot;The business stars of the next decade will have to open new vistas in timeworn markets that other, less innovative entrepreneurs will fail to spot,&quot; believes Dennis Neier, a small-business consultant with the accounting firm of Oppenheim Appel Dixon, New York.    Among the possibilities: any product or service that cuts costs in the health-care field, or that puts high technology to use in such everyday businesses as retailing or custom manufacturing. Successful startups in the 1990s will be businesses that &quot;tackle smaller problems and fill special needs at low costs,&quot; says Richard D'Amore, a general partner in Boston's Hambro International Venture Fund.    Avram Ruditzky thinks he's got the prototype of a 1990s business hit. Cocktail-party chatter with some doctor friends about lousy hospital record-keeping inspired Mr. Ruditzky to start a company, Medical Registry Service Inc., that computerizes hospital records of cancer patients. The year was 1981, and through 1986, the going was slow: Only 41 hospitals signed up and annual revenue seemed to plateau at $1 million.    This year, though, things are different. The heat is on throughout the health-care field to reduce costs and increase efficiency. As part of the trend, physicians, particularly those specializing in cancer treatment, are pressuring hospitals to upgrade and streamline their record-keeping or lose accreditation for certain procedures.    For Medical Registry Service, this development promises to make the 1990s hot indeed. &quot;We will wind up 1987 with at least 90 hospitals and we expect to be a $5 million a year service by the mid-1990s,&quot; predicts Mr. Ruditzky. &quot;We've found a small, neglected business spot that needed filling. We're also planning to expand our record-keeping for hospitals to coronary and kidney diseases and AIDS.&quot;    Whenever entrepreneurs close the gap between complex technology and simple manufacturing, they stand to prosper, an axiom that holds especially true for the decade ahead. &quot;I call it the high tech-low tech bridge to success,&quot; says Sam Rosen, a small-business consultant with Pannel Kerr Forster, accountants.    One candidate, he says, is a client, Albert Andrews Ltd., a Boston clothing maker. Albert Andrews has started using lasers to custom cut suits, jackets and slacks from measurements stored in a personal computer. The computer in turn uses tape and dimension-scanning devices to make as many as 50 body measurements within tolerances of 1/1000th of an inch.    Executives in the years ahead will be too busy to shop, &quot;and we're willing to come to their office or home to take their measurements,&quot; explains Andrew Stern, president of Albert Andrews. Another lure: his process cuts the delivery time for a custom-made suit to under four weeks from the usual six to eight weeks. And once the customer's measurements are stored in the computer, the customer can order different suit patterns and fabrics from a selection presented via videocassette. Mr. Stern, who hopes he's on to a hot 1990s idea, plans to begin expanding his business soon.    Changes in how people dress offer other possibilities. Betting that clothing in the 1990s will be even more casual than it is today, Stage II Apparel Corp., an importer and distributor of mens' sportswear, is gearing up for a boom. &quot;By the next decade, casual sportswear will become 'de rigueur' almost anywhere,&quot; contends Jack Clark, chairman of Stage II. To prove his point, Mr. Clark recently wore a tennis warm-up suit to dinner at Antolloti's, an expensive Manhattan restaurant. Five years ago, he says, no jacket and no tie would have meant no admittance.    Eighties narcissism suggests other market niches for the 1990s. Sharlyne Powell has found one among the truly overweight. Her firm, Women-At-Large, offers exercise classes for clients whose weight typically exceeds 200 pounds. &quot;There's a common misconception that women this big can't or shouldn't do physical fitness,&quot; says Mrs. Powell. &quot;It's a big lie.&quot;    Once over 200 pounds herself and now closer to 150, the five-foot, five-inch Mrs. Powell sees her business expanding rapidly into the next decade. &quot;Many such heavy women hide in their homes because society has told them they're fat and flabby,&quot; says Mrs. Powell. &quot;We get them out to restore their self esteem.&quot;    Besides exercise classes, Women-At-Large gyms also market leotards, tights, leg warmers, jewelry and makeup. Several underwriters have offered to take the company public, but Mrs. Powell has turned them down. &quot;We're making up to $400,000 a year in revenue and franchise fees, and we could be a multimillion dollar company in the next decade,&quot; she says.    High-technology start-ups, darlings of the early 1980s, could be the dogs of the 1990s: Investor interest in these companies already is on the wane.    Some niches, however, remain to be filled.    &quot;Telecommunications will be a red hot spot for new small-business ideas,&quot; believes James R. Swartz, managing partner of Accel Partners, a venture capital firm. One Accel investment, General Communications Corp., has developed telephone-line switching and transmissions devices which offer multiple uses of a single home telephone line, including simultaneous transmission of voices and pictures.    Come the 1990s, says William Kanupke, General Communications president, and there won't be any limit to what folks can do with the telephone.    ---   Mr. Berton is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
