Largely organized by Unicef, one of the U.N.'smore respected agencies, the meeting now promises to beattended by as many as 70 heads of state or government,including President Bush.   According to its sponsors, &quot;the Summit will focus uponuniversal problems affecting children.&quot; The U.S. has reviewedand indicated its approval of one item on the agenda -- aproposed Convention on the Rights of the Child. Were otheraspects of the conference's agenda as carefully examined,however, it is by no means clear they would meet with theapproval of the president, or of the American public.</LP><TEXT>   The conference's main background report is Unicef's &quot;TheWorld Summit for Children,&quot; an updated adaptation of its&quot;State of the World's Children 1990.&quot; The report does indeedcontain proposals for a number of worthy initiatives --diffusion of low-cost technologies for reducing childmortality, for example. Yet much, if not most, of thereport's argumentation is given over to a rather differentpurpose -- to making the case that Western creditors shouldforgive the international debts owed by Third Worldgovernments in the name of the world's children.   Ever since the advent of the &quot;Third World debt crisis&quot; inthe early 1980s, Unicef says, the transfer of resources frompoor countries to rich ones has caused hardship in many areasof the world. To protect their credit standing and meet theirinternational debt-service payments, it argues, thegovernments of many low-income countries have undertakenharsh adjustment policies. These have routinely includedcutbacks in social services upon which the vulnerable depend.As a result, it concludes, &quot;the poorest and most vulnerablechildren have paid the third world's debt with their health .. . {and} with the loss of their opportunity to be educated.&quot;   &quot;Infant mortality,&quot; it says, &quot;is known to have risen inparts of Latin America and Africa,&quot; and &quot;the proportion ofchildren enrolled {in school} began to fall&quot; for developingregions as a whole. Thus, &quot;the sine qua non of a resumptionof human progress&quot; is said to be &quot;some significant reductionin debt servicing&quot; -- preferably through &quot;writing off of mostof the remaining debts of Africa . . . {and} furtherreductions in the commercial debts of Latin America.&quot;   This is not the first time that Unicef has suggested thatcreditors in affluent Western countries were killing babiesby insisting upon debt repayments. In 1988, for instance, itsannual report announced that 500,000 children in low-incomecountries had died in the previous year due to conditionsassociated with the debt crisis. Yet each major component ofUnicef's argument is either debatable or demonstrablyinaccurate. Taken together, they constitute a seriousmisdiagnosis of the problems facing children and othervulnerable groups in most of the world.   The notion that the &quot;Third World&quot; is being drained ofresources by rich countries is not a new one. To document itsassertions, however, Unicef relies upon a specific set ofnumbers produced by the World Bank. Those data indicate thatpoor countries, on balance, have been transferring resourcesto rich ones since 1982, and that the magnitude of the nettransfer approached $40 billion a year in the late 1980s. Yeteven the World Bank has discarded those estimates asunreliable. In response to criticism from the Organizationfor Economic Cooperation and Development, the World Bankitself now uses a substantially revised set of figures.   The OECD's estimates, incidentally, indicate that the nettransfer of resources to developing countries as a whole hasremained strongly positive during the years of the debtcrisis, albeit at a lower absolute level than in the yearsleading up to it. Between 1983 and 1987, for example, theOECD estimates that the developing countries enjoyed a nettransfer from abroad of more than $130 billion (not adjustedfor inflation or exchange-rate fluctuations). The &quot;leastdeveloped&quot; countries -- a group including much of sub-SaharanAfrica -- are estimated to have received a net (unadjusted)transfer from the West and its funding agencies of more than$50 billion during that period alone.   Unicef's claims about the adjustment policies of highlyindebted governments are scarcely more convincing. The mostcomprehensive and reliable figures on public finance in theThird World are those of the International Monetary Fund,which serves as a creditor to many of these governments.According to its data and estimates, central governmentexpenditures accounted for a greater fraction of nationaloutput in developing countries in 1987 (the most recent yearavailable) than in 1982 -- the year the debt crisis broke.   The same is true of central government expenditures net oflending and repayments -- in other words, after the impact ofthe debt crisis is specifically taken into account. Even inAfrica and Latin America, government spending, adjusted forlending and repayments, appears to account for a greatershare of gross domestic product today than before the debtcrisis. Only against an expectation of even more rapidgovernment growth could current spending be characterized asgenerally austere.   What about the charges that infant mortality rates arerising, and educational enrollment rates are dropping, inregions of the Third World? In its report for the summit,Unicef does not attempt to explain how it would document itsinfant mortality assertions. It is difficult, in fact, toimagine how anyone would do so.   To measure year-to-year changes in infant mortality rates,one would need reasonably complete figures on births andinfant deaths. According to the U.N. Population Division,there are today only 14 countries or territories in thedeveloping regions with populations of a million or more andinfant mortality registration 90% or more complete. By theU.N.'s reckoning, these places account for less than 3% ofthe developing world's population. None is in sub-SaharanAfrica.   That these places publish annual figures on infantmortality, of course, makes them atypical. For what it isworth, however, two of them -- Chile and Uruguay -- have beenthrough rescheduling of their government debt. Debt crisisnotwithstanding, infant mortality in Uruguay was more than35% lower in 1987 than in 1980; in Chile, more than 40%lower.   Unicef's postulated drop in Third World school enrollmentis equally elusive. Unesco's data are considered to beauthoritative on this topic. According to Unesco's mostrecent figures, net enrollment ratios for developingcountries as a group have risen steadily throughout the1980s, and are higher than ever before.   At first exposure, Unicef's intricate and energeticattempt to equate Third World debt to the distress ofchildren may seem rather peculiar. But, reduced to itsbasics, the viewpoint bears distinct resemblance to earliercalls for the &quot;New International Economic Order.&quot; Thoseproposals, in vogue in the 1970s at the U.N. and elsewhere,envisioned massive and unconditional transfers from taxpayersin the West to governments in the Third World.   The World Summit for Children, it appears, willreintroduce this rhetoric and reasoning to respectableaudiences in a new and improved format. No longer will theappeal for vast transfers be couched in terms of the desireof Third World rulers to assume their rightful place at theinternational table. It will be cast in terms of helpless,powerless and manifestly innocent victims in those samecountries.   It is ironic that Unicef and others should be making thecase for the New International Economic Order into achildren's issue. In its original variant, the essence of theproposal was unaccountability. In the ambitious new world tocome, Third World governments would be unanswerable to theirWestern benefactors -- and to the populations they themselvesrule.   There is a connection between the debt crisis and theplight of children. The very states that request, andrequire, large-scale and continuous concessional transfersfrom abroad to sustain them seem, during times of financialdifficulty, to be among those least averse to exposingchildren and other vulnerable groups under their authority.That, however, is one threat to children that summiteers areunlikely to hear about at their weekend conference.   ---   Mr. Eberstadt is a researcher with Harvard's Center forPopulation Studies and the American Enterprise Institute.</TEXT></DOC>
