Paul Freedenberg, acting under secretary of commerce, said that in addition to doing away with mail delays, the system gives license officers instant access to all the information they need to act on license requests. He estimated that the system can process licenses for exports to allied countries in only three days and those for exports to other nonsocialist countries in 13.    Counting mail transit time, the usual wait is 15 days for the first kind of license and 20 for the second.    Commerce Secretary William Verity launched the new system yesterday by electronically dispatching a document to Hewlett-Packard Co. in Palo Alto, Calif., authorizing it to ship a $12,000 computer to Italy. </TEXT></DOC>
