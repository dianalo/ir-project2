One opposition leader suggested negotiations with Lt. Gen. HenriNamphy, who proclaimed himself president on Monday.   As night fell on a calm capital late Tuesday, there was concernamong relatives of some members of the Manigat government who werearrested during the coup.   ``We only hope they come back as soon as possible,'' saidFrancois Savain. His father, Roger Savain, was information ministerand Francois' brother, Roger Jr., was a close friend of Manigat.   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthe two Savains, former Information Ministry officials RodneyMarcellus and Jean Narces Lescouflair, and Manigat Cabinet chiefLionel Desgranges were arrested. The source didn't know whether thefive remained in custody Tuesday.   Capt. Isidor Pignon, commander of Fort Dimanche where politicalprisoners are usually taken, angrily refused to tell The AssociatedPress whether the Manigat aides were there.   Few other people in this impoverished city seemed upset by theevents that ended Manigat's 4-month-old civilian government andbrought back Namphy, who had run the country for two years afterthe Duvalier dictatorship ended.   ``The message is clear: Haitians have been mocked for too longby their governments. The people are not concerned because theynever accepted Manigat. This has been an affair at the top,'' saidthe Rev. Antoine Adrien, a liberal Roman Catholic priest andadvocate of democracy.   A sociologist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said:``Manigat by words alone wanted to maintain the illusion ofdemocracy. One puff of the army's bad breath blew it away.''   In Washington, the State Department said the United States wouldmaintain relations with the new government and work towarddemocracy through diplomacy, not sanctions. ``There is no break inthe diplomatic relations; we're not contemplating it,'' spokeswomanPhyllis Oakley said.   Manigat is in the Dominican Republic, which shares the Caribbeanisland of Hispaniola with Haiti. He told reporters he had beenurging foreign governments and international organizations toisolate the military government Namphy set up.   ``My government represented the only and final chance fordemocracy,'' Manigat said. ``The other democratic sectors haveunderstood that too late and it was their political mistake torefuse the public support that would have strengthened mygovernment.''   Manigat, a 57-year-old former political science professor,called the new regime ``very fragile.'' He said the coup was theresult of corruption in the military.   He said he did not know what role was played in the coup orsubsequent events by Col. Jean-Claude Paul, who has been indictedon drug trafficking charges by a federal court in Miami.   ``Namphy always acted on his own,'' Manigat said, adding that hehad faith in Paul as a loyal military man.   Manigat sided with Paul last week by overruling Namphy's orderending the colonel's command of the 700-man Dessalines Battalion,whose barracks is just behind the National Palace.   Manigat dismissed Namphy and confined him to his home, but loyalofficers freed him late Sunday.   Paul, however, was at Namphy's side Monday when the 55-year-oldgeneral waved an Uzi submachine gun on television and announced hismilitary government. Namphy restored Paul to his command and the7,000-man Haitian army appears united.   No injuries or deaths have been reported in the coup. Sporadicshooting was heard in Port-au-Prince overnight but no casualtieswere reported Tuesday. Gunfire at night is part of a tradition ofintimidation in Haiti.   Opposition political leaders boycotted the Jan. 17 election,which Manigat won with the army's help. Most expressed the beliefTuesday that a new chance for democracy might follow his ouster.   In Puerto Rico, where he lives in self-exile, Louis Dejoie IIurged a dialogue between Namphy and politicians.   ``The only way to put the country back on track is to have free,honest elections,'' said Dejoie, one of four leading presidentialcandidates who refused to enter the Jan. 17 election. ``Manigat wasnot viable nationally or internationally'' and ``tried todouble-cross the army the way he double-crossed the democraticforces.''   ``Namphy has no popularity,'' he said. ``I will wait and seewhat the military government offers the people before judging them.They can't govern forever with bayonets.''   Haiti, the world's first black republic, won independence fromFrance in 1804 and has experienced dozens of coups and autocraticregimes.   Namphy led a military-civilian junta that ran Haiti afterPresident Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Feb. 7, 1986, ending the29-year dictatorship founded by his father, Francois ``Papa Doc''Duvalier. Namphy turned the government over to Manigat last Feb. 7.   Namphy said he overthrew Manigat because the president betrayeddemocracy and the constitution. Namphy and his army have made clearthey consider a good civilian government to be one that lets themilitary keep its traditional role as the power behind the throne.</TEXT></DOC>
