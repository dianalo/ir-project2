H.J. Heinz Co.'s StarKist Seafood unit said it will nolonger buy tuna caught in a manner that can injure or killdolphins. StarKist, the world's largest tuna canner, said itwas responding to consumer concerns over dolphin safety.</LP><TEXT>   Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc. followed suit a short time later.It told the Associated Press that it &quot;would now implement itsplan to end the purchase of tuna caught in association withdolphin.&quot;   &quot;Our tuna cans will begin to reflect the dolphin-safelabel in U.S. stores within the next three months,&quot; the SanDiego-based company's statement said.   A third tuna canner, Van Kamp Seafood of St. Louis, whichsells the Chicken of the Sea brand, said it would make&quot;further enhancements to its established campaign for theprotection and preservation of dolphins.&quot;   Pittsburgh-based Heinz had come under fire fromenvironmentalists who say 100,000 dolphins are killed eachyear in nets set to capture tuna, specifically in the PacificOcean from Chile to Southern California. Earlier this week,in another gesture to environmentalists, Heinz unveiled plansfor a recyclable plastic ketchup bottle.   StarKist said 90% of the 250,000 tons of tuna it buys eachyear is already &quot;dolphin safe,&quot; but now it will only buy tunafrom boats in which government observers have certified nodolphins were killed.   StarKist said it will have to buy some of its tuna fromother oceans, which will increase costs. But it said thatwould have little effect on price.   Environmentalists praised the latest announcement.&quot;They've really taken the lead on this and gone beyond whatwe expected,&quot; said Blair Palese, spokesperson for Greenpeace,an environmental group.   Representatives of the nation's tuna fishing fleet,however, called the move &quot;a political response to ascientific issue&quot; that would do little to save the lives ofdolphins, and said it could &quot;severely impact, if not destroy,the U.S. tuna fleet.&quot;   For years, most tuna have been caught by boats that casttheir nets around the herds of dolphins that generally swimabove the fish. Fishermen then push the dolphins out andharvest the fish, although dolphins can die if they becometangled in the nets.   August Felando, president of the American TunaboatAssociation, said that dolphins will continue to be encircledby foreign boats seeking the larger yellowfin tuna that swimbeneath. &quot;Foreign boats, which operate free of stringent U.S.quotas (for killing dolphins) will simply sell their catch toa growing European market and elsewhere,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
