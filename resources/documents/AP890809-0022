Jacob said after Bush's address Tuesday.   ``We will use the next 12 months to determine how well he doesin carrying that out. His rhetoric is right. He is saying the rightthings. Now we have to find out whether he is willing to do theright things,'' Jacob said.   Joseph E. Lowery, president of the Southern Christian LeadershipConference, was scheduled to address the concluding session of theconference today.   Bush, the first president to address an Urban League conferencesince President Carter in 1979, received generous applause as hepledged that his administration ``will not tolerate discrimination,bigotry or bias of any kind.''   But Joan N. Tokley, president of the Tampa, Fla., Urban League,said, ``I would have felt a lot more comfortable if the presidenthad addressed the recent rulings of the Supreme Court, especiallythose that deal with affirmative action.''   Recent decisions of the court have held that state and localgovernments generally may not impose racial quotas for public workshiring, that minorities must meet higher statistical standards toprove they are being relegated to less desirable jobs, and thatwhite workers not involved in an 8-year-old affirmative actionruling were nevertheless entitled to attack it in court.   ``No matter what he says his moral and philosophical convictionis ... at this point I haven't heard him say anything about thelaws in this country that were designed to protect blacks, womenand other minorities,'' Ms. Tokley said. ``And until he does, Iwill not be convinced that he actually means what he says.''   Harold Hood, a Michigan Court of Appeals judge attending theconference, said Bush's address ``was a very neutral talk as far asminorities were concerned.''   ``I don't know that I expect him to be on our side,'' Hood said.``I'd be happy if he isn't against us. And at least I didn't getthe sense that he's against us, and that's a plus.''   Bush told the delegates the gulf between white and black Americahas narrowed, but has not been closed.   ``Closing that gulf _ eliminating it for all time _ is the nextchapter we must write in the unfolding history, the unfinishedhistory, of civil rights,'' Bush said.   He conceded that he and civil rights leaders have disagreedabout how to accomplish that.   ``We've argued _ society's argued _ about affirmative action,about quotas, goals and timetables, about set-asides,'' he said.   But the most important point, the president said, is that``bigotry and bias may take more subtle forms (than in the past)but they persist _ and as long as they do, our work is not over.''</TEXT></DOC>
