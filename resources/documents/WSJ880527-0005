The rules, which won't become final for several months, would require increased inspections of the fuselages of such planes. The requirements would apply to any of the first 464 Boeing 737s ever made that have made 40,000 flights or more.    The rules are designed to check for potential structural weaknesses in older 737s. The safety of older planes has been the focus of intense debate since April 28, when an Aloha Airlines 737 lost part of the top of its fuselage in midflight. A flight attendant was killed, but the pilots managed to land the plane safely.    The new regulations will replace an emergency May 4 order that required increased scrutiny of older 737s. That order, which will remain in force until the new rules take effect, applies to any of the first 291 Boeing 737s made that have made 30,000 flights or more.    The FAA estimates that about 100 planes operated by U.S. carriers initially would have to undergo the inspections required by the proposed new rules. But the number will go up as aircraft age.    The first 464 Boeing 737s made are coming under scrutiny because of the way sections of the planes' outer skin were bonded together. The outer shells of the first 291 Boeing 737s, including that of the jet involved in the Aloha accident, were attached through a &quot;cold bonding&quot; process that safety officials now believe may lead to the propagation of cracks in the skin. A &quot;hot bonding&quot; process was used on the next 173 Boeings made. Then, according to FAA officials, Seattle-based Boeing improved the process.    Boeing officials couldn't be reached for comment.    Separately, Transportation Secretary James Burnley informed Congress that he won't be able to fulfill a congressional order that the FAA have 10,450 fully qualified air traffic controllers by Sept. 30. He said he would fall 518 short of the number.    In response, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, (D., N.J.), chairman of the Senate's transportation appropriations subcommittee, plans to introduce legislation that would require the agency to rehire controllers fired during the 1981 strike to meet the congressional staffing goals. President Reagan has threatened to veto any legislation calling for the rehiring of fired controllers. </TEXT></DOC>
