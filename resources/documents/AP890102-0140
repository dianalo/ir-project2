Dan Turner and CristoferShihar had one chance in five of seeing 1984.   They don't know why they've survived what has been a deathsentence for more than 45,000 Americans, but say it may be a matterof attitude.   ``A lot of people don't die of the disease, they die because theygive up,'' said Mike, a 34-year-old Chicago accountant diagnosedwith AIDS in January 1984. He asked that his last name be withheld.   According to Judith Wiker, a Chicago holistic therapist who saysshe has counseled hundreds of clients with AIDS or AIDS-relatedproblems, Mike is one of many people with the disease who are wellenough to feel and act normal.   Scientists are trying to determine just why some people havesurvived as long as 10 years with AIDS. The federal Centers forDisease Control in Atlanta is studying 119 people known to havelived with it for three or more years. The National Institutes ofHealth is funding other research.   For the purposes of the CDC's 2-year-old study, long-termsurvivors were defined as people who lived at least three yearsafter being diagnosed. Unlike the estimated hundreds of thousands ofAmericans who are infected with the AIDS virus but do not havesymptoms, long-term AIDS survivors actually have battled one or moreailments that define AIDS _ including Kaposi's sarcoma, pneumonia,damaged immune systems and severe weight loss.   Most are white homosexual men in their 30s whose main or onlysymptom is Kaposi's, the skin cancer that was rare before AIDSbecame an epidemic.   For Mike, an accountant, three years of chemotherapy kept theskin sores of Kaposi's sarcoma at bay. He then began treatment withthe drug AZT, now called zidovudine, which prolongs the lives ofmany with AIDS.   Turner, 42, of San Francisco, was diagnosed with Kaposi's inFebruary 1982, before most Americans had heard of AIDS. He underwentchemotherapy, a year of acupuncture, megadoses of Vitamin C, hastaken zidovudine intermittently and still gets alpha-interferon, agenetically engineered anti-cancer drug.   ``I think the one thing I hear from people I know who havesurvived is they're real stubborn,'' said Shihar, 38, who wasdiagnosed with Kaposi's in November 1982 and who works for NorthernLights Alternatives, a New York-based education and supportorganization for people with AIDS.   Regardless of psychological factors, survival prospectscontinually improve in newly diagnosed cases. Even two years ago, 80percent of people with AIDS were expected to die within 24 months,said Dr. Nathaniel Pier, a New York physician with a large number ofAIDS patients.</TEXT><NOTE>Funding Problems Fail To Hold Up Artificial Heart Development</NOTE><DATELINE>HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Clarisse, a calf with an electric heart, isone sign that political fighting over federal funding hasn't stoppedresearchers trying to develop a permanent replacement for as many as400 diseased hearts a year.   Clarisse got her heart Dec. 8, about eight months after theNational Institutes of Health decided to suspend $20 million incontracts for research on a permanent artificial heart _ and sixmonths after the NIH reversed itself.   Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Hearth, Lung andBlood Institute _ a part of the NIH _ questioned in May whether morethan a decade of research would lead to a permanent heart that thebody wouldn't reject.   Under pressure from members of Congress, Lenfant said in Julythat the contracts would not be suspended. The five groups fundedare Hershey Medical Center of Pennsylvania State University; theUniversity of Utah; Abiomed Inc. of Danvers, Mass., working with theTexas Heart Institute of Houston; and Nimbus Co. of Rancho Cordova,Calif., working with the Cleveland Clinic.   Researchers at Penn State and Utah have been working since themid-1970s on electrical versions of the air-driven, or pneumatic,heart first implanted in Seattle dentist Barney Clark in December1982 at the University of Utah.   Recipients of air-driven hearts remain mostly bedridden inhospitals, linked by tubes to large compressors, unless they gethuman heart transplants. Recipients of the electric heart will beable to walk, exercise and even work.   ``The advantage of these hearts is that you'll be able to puteverything inside the patient's chest except the battery,'' saidGerson Rosenberg, assistant chief of Penn State's division ofartifical organs.   Because the devices must meet specific requirements, designs aresimilar. The Penn State device, which has the size and heft of asquared softball, has a 10-pound, rechargeable battery pack on awaist belt. A battery in the heart will let a recipient take off theexternal battery for up to 45 minutes.   The device, designed to last about five years, probably will costabout the $80,000 to $100,000 that a heart transplant costs,Rosenberg said.</TEXT><NOTE>Researcher Challenges Shark Theories</NOTE><DATELINE>CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Samuel Gruber wants to change theperception of sharks as prehistoric, and says the ocean-goingkilling machines have a complex immune system that could become an``antibody factory'' for humans.   Gruber, a University of Miami biological oceanographer, has beenintrigued with sharks since an underwater encounter with ahammerhead in 1958.   ``After 30 years of studying them, the most astonishing thingI've found about sharks is that they are so sophisticated. They haveso many systems that are in higher animals, that if you didn't knowbetter, you'd think that _ like the whales _ they evolved on landand went back to the sea.''   Gruber studies the lemon shark, unique because it can survivewhile motionless in the water, making observation easier. Among theoddities he has observed are its ``highly generalized but extremelypowerful'' immune system.   Products from shark immune systems have shown promise in treatingdiseases, including cancer, he said. ``They are not only able tomake antibodies, they already have antibodies to many disease thatthey would never see or get, such as human smallpox.''   When attacked by a disease, sharks generate huge amounts ofantibodies, making them a potential factory for helping humans fightdiseases like AIDS or cancer, he said. ``If we could keep a numberof sharks and raise antibodies, then each person could have his ownshark, his own antibody factory.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Jan. 5</NOTE></DOC>
