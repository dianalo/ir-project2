Taylor (editorial page, Nov. 10) proposed that child-labor laws be changed to prevent young people from carrying newspapers. He suggests our young people be deprived of the opportunity of working because the newspaper industry is prosperous, newspaper delivery is dangerous and carriers do not receive adequate compensation.    The laws should not be changed to deny young people the opportunity of working. Current laws have been in existence for many years and are adequate. Approximately 850,000 boys and girls are working to earn money for college and home expenses.    The newspaper business prospers today because it is well managed and serves the needs of its readers and advertisers. Carriers share adequately in the profit. A carrier's profit is typically a percentage of the newsstand or home-delivery price of the paper. When a newspaper increases newsstand or home-delivery rates, the carrier's profit is increased proportionately.    Carrier safety is always a paramount concern to a newspaper. If a route is considered hazardous to a carrier, it is converted to an adult motor route. Newspapers for many years have had programs to teach bike safety, etc. Statistics would show that delivering a newspaper route is no more dangerous than walking or riding a bus to school. Carrier-safety awareness has resulted in heroic deeds by carriers in saving many lives of those threatened by fires and other emergency situations.    Child-labor laws should control abuses where abuses exist. But in our zeal to protect young people, we should not be overprotective. &quot;What have you done?&quot; is a typical question asked by the employment interviewer. When such a question is asked of a young person, all too frequently the honest answer has to be &quot;nothing.&quot; We must not deny our young people the opportunity to be &quot;doers.&quot;    Being a newspaper carrier has real educational value. They learn how to handle money and manage a business. It teaches the work ethic at a young age. Work is not a panacea for everything, but it is one approach to learning. Calvin Coolidge once said, &quot;All growth depends on activity. It is not development physically or intellectually without effort, and effort means work. Work is not a curse, it is the prerogative of intelligence, the only means to manhood, and the measure of civilization.&quot;    Grover Friend   President, Calkins Newspapers   Levittown, Pa.</TEXT></DOC>
