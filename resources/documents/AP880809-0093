Byrd saidtoday there is no room for further compromise with Republicans onaid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels because ``we've gone as far as wecan go.''   Byrd, D-W.Va., told reporters he is prepared to press theDemocratic aid plan to a vote and continues to hope it will attractbipartisan support.   ``That would send the right message to Central America,'' hesaid.   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said``we're still hopeful of getting a Contra aid package passed.''   Speaking to reporters not long after President Reagan met withRepublican congressional leaders, Fitzwater said ``the Democratssay they want a bill.'' But he also said that ``the language (ofthe Democratic bill) is convoluted.''   Many Republican senators made it clear Monday they do not trustthe Democrats to carry out their side of the bargain. They said theDemocratic aid plan is seriously flawed because it does not containadequate resources to deliver stockpiled arms to the Contras andhas no guarantee House Speaker James Wright will permit a vote.   Byrd was asked if there was any flexibility on his side of theissue.   ``No, I don't think so,'' he replied. ``It seems to me we'vegone as far as we can go.''   Fitzwater said the administration is concerned about what hecalled weaknesses in the Democratic bill with respect to systemsfor getting assistance delivered to the Contras.   He said that bill ``would have the impact of saying you candeliver it in Honduras but not in Nicaragua, and that's where thetroops are.''   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, speaking Mondayafter a private meeting in which many Republicans objected to theDemocratic plan, said he would take ``one more shot'' atnegotiating a bipartisan aid package.   However, he added: ``I wouldn't want to be overly optimistic.''   Byrd also said he hoped some compromise could be reached.   But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said compromise was unlikelybecause the debate over aid to the rebels fighting Nicaragua'sleftist Sandinista government ``has been so long, so emotional, sopartisan, that there's little trust.''   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who took part in talks withRepublicans on the compromise legislation last week, said flatly,``The negotiations are over. I don't think there is any more room.We've gone as far as we can go.''   The Democratic plan would permit $27.1 million in immediatenon-lethal ``humanitarian'' aid to the Contras.   It also would give President Reagan an opportunity to askCongress this fall to release some $16.3 million in previouslypurchased arms, ammunition and other military supplies now storedin warehouses in Central America.   But it also requires Reagan to certify that such military aid tothe Contras is justified because Nicaragua has disrupted the``peace and stability'' of Central America by taking two of thesethree actions: an unprovoked military attack on the Contras,``blatant violations'' of the regional peace plan, and continued``unacceptable levels of military assistance by Soviet-bloccountries, including Cuba.''   Some senators said Nicaragua's rulers could prevent the militaryaid from being released ``just by being good boys for 30 days.''   Conservative Republicans called on Dole to force a vote on aRepublican alternative which would make $20 million in new U.S.military aid available to the Contras as well as releasingpreviously approved military aid from warehouses and providing the``humanitarian'' assistance.   Sources inside the meeting said Army Lt. Gen. Colin Powell,President Reagan's national security adviser, reported that he has``serious reservations'' about the plan.   Byrd said that if progress is not made in reconstructing abipartisan alliance on the issue, he will offer the Democratic aidplan as an amendment to the pending Defense Departmentappropriations bill.   Contra leaders contacted the White House and several GOPsenators Monday morning to declare their unanimous opposition tothat plan.   Bosco Matamoros, a spokesman for the Contra resistance forces,said Contra leaders see the Democratic plan as resulting from``internal politics in the United States which basically seek toreward (Nicaraguan President) Daniel Ortega for not complying withthe commitments of the peace process.''</TEXT></DOC>
