 These new systems have less-quantitative benefits thanearlier systems that merely automated accounting and payroll.andM;Regardless, systems analysts and management still often ignore thesignificance of qualitative benefits when evaluating systems developmentproject proposals.andP;  Typically, project proposals simply include checklists ofintangible benefits, such as higher accuracy of data and improved customerservice, with minimal description.andM;Qualitative benefits are seen as &quot;icing on the cake&quot; when projects havequantifiable economic impact, whether in the form of new earnings or savings,or early paybacks.andP;  On the other hand, qualitative benefits also may sellsystems that do not have early paybacks and that management probably wouldhave rejected otherwise.andM;The danger of excluding or not properly emphasizing qualitative benefits isthe neglect or rejection of many potential new systems offering high returnsfrom intangible benefits.andP;  Benefits such as improved decision-making,customer satisfaction, and employee productivity contribute significantly tomost businesses.andP;  Each allows management to capitalize on opportunities notpreviously available.andM;To identify and measure intangible or qualitative benefits for systemsdevelopment project proposals, they must first be distinguished from theirquantitative cousins.andP;  Quantitative benefits directly reduce cost or increaserevenue.andP;  Staff reduction typifies these benefits.andP;  Because they can bedirectly attributed to a particular system, they are easily identified,measured, and verified.andP;  Intangible benefits have an indirect relationship,if any, to cost reductions, and depend on several variables.andP;  For example, asystem may contribute perhaps only one factor, such as better information, toimproved decision-making.andP;  Other factors, such as decision-makers'capabilities and the circumstances, also contribute, and realizing improveddecision-making depends on each of them.andP;  Each factor has associatedprobabilities that seldom recur and which makes them difficult to assess,resulting in cash flows that are difficult to assess.andM;Despite the importance of intangible benefits, systems analysts receivelittle help in identifying or presenting them.andP;  Increased employeeproductivity may have resulted from work measurement systems.andP;  Nevertheless,verifying the value of that productivity requires several things: thatmechanisms measuring employee productivity under the new system arecomparable to previous measures; that employees' work does not change; andthat employees can accomplish another measurable task with the increased timeavailable.andM;Some benefits may not have any cost savings associated with them.andP;  Forexample, an electric utility's major objective is to provide quality customerservice at a low price.andP;  One measure of service quality might be customers'attitudes.andP;  A system might provide billing statements in an improved formatthat improves customers' attitudes.andP;  Assigning dollar figures to this benefitmeans little, however, as customers aren't likely to purchase moreelectricity as a result of the improved format.andM;The difficulty in assigning value to information in general exemplifies theproblems in identifying and measuring qualitative benefits to systems.andO;Computers can provide faster retrieval, improved accuracy, and betterpresentation of an increased volume of information, but the value of thosecapabilities depends on the value of the information itself.andP;  Information hasan implied value if decisions would differ without it.andP;  Conversely,information has no value if it does not influence decisions.andP;  Methods fordetermining the value of information range from &quot;theoretical utility&quot;approaches to &quot;expected value&quot; approaches.andP;  Each depends on analysts'subjectivity.andP;  Similarly, the value of qualitative benefits depends on thesubjectivity of analysts, users, and management.andM;Identifying Qualitative BenefitsandM;To successfully identify qualitative benefits, all members of the projectteam must understand the project's and the company's goals and objectives,management's attitude toward such benefits, and the industry.andM;Although the computer profession has not emphasized qualitative benefits,other professions have.andP;  Public administrators and marketers attempt todetermine the &quot;why&quot; behind the numbers, allowing researchers to explore andidentify the interrelationships of issues.andM;The computing profession would benefit from these approaches to evaluatingverbal and behavioral data; they require key people to discuss their ownpriorities, problems, and perceptions.andM;Qualitative methods use various forms of unstructured and nondirectiveinquiry.andP;  Open-ended questions allow respondents to create their ownframework of response.andP;  Analysts must upgrade their interviewer skill levelsfrom asking yes/no questions.andP;  A broad range of business experience and theability to ask &quot;dumb&quot; questions will assist in learning new insights byinterpreting responses and not simply accepting them at face value.andM;Benefits MethodologyandM;Methods used for identifying these benefits include focus groups, in-depthinterviews, expert opinion, the Delphi technique, observation, benefitprofile charts, and existing, systems review.andM;Focus groups should consist of from eight to 10 people who delve into anissue for one to two hours.andP;  Analysts begin discussion with open-endedquestions and act as moderators, providing direction and focusing discussionon the topic.andP;  An advantage of focus groups is the stimulation thatrespondents provide one another.andP;  When conducting focus groups, participantsshould have similar backgrounds or rank; otherwise, clients resist sharingtheir ideas.andP;  Assembling focus groups may prove less convenient thaninterviewing individuals, but it costs less than in-depth interviews becauseanalysts can talk to several people at one time.andP;  The groups help identifybenefits associated with systems that have large numbers of users fromsimilar positions.andP;  For example, a proposed customer information systemproject might form a focus group of customer relations staff to aid analystsin identifying benefits.andM;In-depth interviews.andP;  These interviews provide the detailed thoughts andopinions of an individual rather than the general opinions of a group.andO;Analysts see individuals in their environment, which helps them to understandthe subjects' responsibilities.andM;The expert opinion and the Delphi technique.andP;  These assist when little or nodata exists to assess the impact of future events.andP;  The expert opinion methoduses interviews or surveys of experts to derive opinions.andP;  With thistechnique, analysts do not necessarily attempt to reach consensus amongexperts.andP;  The Delphi method surveys experts regarding the probability ofoccurrences and their likely effects.andP;  Analysts compute survey results, andexperts review them independently and revise them accordingly until the groupreaches consensus.andP;  The Delphi method attempts to reduce bias that occursduring face-to-face interviews or group discussions.andM;These two methods determine the likelihood of benefits.andP;  A compilation ofboth survey results would aid analysts in determining the validity ofbenefits, providing support for their presentation.andM;Observation.andP;  Analysts can use either random observance or &quot;continuousshadowing.&quot;andP;  With the random method, analysts observe individuals who areunaware of being observed.andP;  By contrast, with the continuous shadowingtechnique, route workers are aware of being observed and probably alter theirbehavior.andP;  Observation familiarizes analysts with user environments, allowingthem to visualize the system's interaction with user functions.andP;  Thedisadvantage of observation is that analysts get no idea of the cognitiveprocesses involved in observed work.andM;A benefit profile chart describes a comprehensive list of various benefits,such as greater reliability, more concise information, easier access, andbetter use of employee time, among other things.andP;  Probably the most popularmethod used by computer professionals today, benefit profile charts helpassure analysts that they do not overlook any significant items.andM;A review of existing systems can identify benefits not realized until afterimplementation.andP;  This could help identify qualitative benefits for a proposedsystem.andP;  The review could ask users how the system affects their jobs, whatnew things it enables them to do, results of any additional capabilities, ifthey anticipate any additional future benefits, and which resources arerequired to accomplish existing work without systems.andM;Factors to ConsiderandM;Independent of any of the above methods, analysts should consider severalfactors when identifying benefits:andM;* User involvement.andP;  Most development methodologies emphasize userinvolvement in systems design.andP;  Although excluding users from systems designis a mistake, the other extreme--of assigning users responsibility, withminimal assistance from systems analysts--can also cause problems.andP;  Eventhough users know systems environments, they are not usually familiar withanalysis methods.andM;* Users' critical success factors (CSFs).andP;  CSFs, as defined by J. Rockart inthe Harvard Business Review (March-April 1979), are the areas in whichsatisfactory results ensure successful performance for the firm.andP;  Forexample, a financial manager's CSFs may include budget compliance for theoverall organization and return on investment.andP;  Identifying how systems cansupport users' CSFs can result in identification of potential benefits.andM;* Multiple user perspectives.andP;  Analysts must consider that people atdifferent levels and departments in the organization have different sets ofCSFs.andP;  What some consider intangible benefits, others consider intangiblecosts, especially with multiuser systems.andP;  For example, accounting andfinance management are likely to perceive positively the implementation of aninventory system because of the financial benefits expected from improvedcontrol over inventory.andP;  Sales management, however, might assume a lack ofproduct availability.andM;* Explicitness.andP;  Explicit identification is necessary when presentingbenefits to management.andP;  Improved decision-making has minimal value formanagement if analysts do not identify those decisions affected, how systemaffect decision processes, and the possible results.andM;* Assumption documentation.andP;  Successful benefit presentation depends uponexplicitly documenting the assumptions that were made during benefitidentification, allowing reviewers to evaluate the degree of subjectivityinvolved.andM;Several approaches measure and present qualitative benefits, includingincremental analysis, value analysis, expected value, the excess tangiblecost method, the worst/most-likely/best-case method, or a checklist approach.andO;These also deserve exploration.andM;Incremental analysis calculates the cost to perform the work if systemsdidn't exist.andP;  The first step requires analysts to estimate maximum workloadsfor future time periods and assign probabilities to the likelihood ofreaching those limits.andP;  Users and analysts identify alternative methods foraccomplishing forecasted workloads, assigning costs to each and translatingestimated costs into benefits by using corresponding probabilities.andM;Assume that state or federal regulations require utilities to carry outconservation programs and that analysts are considering the development of asystem to aid in administering those programs.andP;  The proposed system would runon a mainframe.andP;  Analysts could ask future users, industry experts, and/orcompany management what volume of transactions they expect.andP;  The results ofthe analysts' survey might identify the expected transactions processed eachyear as follows: .6 probability for 400,000 transactions .3 probability for800,000 transactions .1 probability for 1.2 million transactions.andM;Multiplying each probability factor by its respective transaction load cost,it becomes possible to compare the costs of three different alternatives toimplementing a new system.andP;  The alternatives might be these:andM;* Hire two $25,000-per-year clerks who can each manually process 200,000transactions, for a total of 400,000 transactions at $50,000, 800,000transactions for $100,000, and 1.2 million transactions for $150,000, for atotal cost of $75,000.andM;* Subcontract to a service bureau charging $55,000 for 400,000 transactions,$75,000 for 800,000 transactions, and $90,000 for 1.2 million transactions,for a total cost of $64,500.andM;* Implement the system on personal computers at a cost of $65,000 for 400,000transactions, $70,000 for 800,000 transactions, and $85,000 for 1.2 milliontransactions, for a total cost of $68,500.andM;A benefit's value equals the least-cost alternative, which in this case issubcontracting to an outside service with a value of $64,500.andP;  This approachcarries two disadvantages.andP;  First, since the the least-costly alternative isconsidered the system's benefit, users and analysts likely won't identifyother specific benefits or notice them when they are realized.andP;  The seconddisadvantage is that it is difficult to verify, during a post-implementationaudit, benefits that were accrued through cost avoidance rather than costreduction.andM;Incremental analysis, however, aids analysts in determining future processingand computing capacity requirements, and in evaluating alternatives oradditional computing resources.andM;The value analysis method, also called adaptive design, uses threeassumptions: that innovation is value driven and not cost driven; thatintangibles can be identified and subjectively assessed but rarely measuredaccurately; and that an inevitable clash exists between those persons drivenby cost and those driven by effectiveness.andM;A multistage iterative process begins with a prototype system.andP;  Rather thandevelop extensive specifications, analysts provide beginning models to expandand modify until a more complete design evolves.andP;  Users provide analysts withfeedback on the prototype's value and limitations.andP;  The difference betweenincremental and value analysis is that the former method begins with a finalsolution while the latter uses an evolutionary process.andP;  The amount thatusers are willing to pay to obtain the benefits of prototyping overincremental analysis is called a cost threshold.andM;Analysts determine whether a prototype can be implemented within the costthreshold.andP;  If so, they design the prototype, measure its use and costs,obtain feedback from users, and modify the accrued benefits to reflectfeedback.andP;  The next step identifies and estimates one-time or fixed costs forthe more complete system that would evolve from the prototype.andP;  Examples ofone-time and fixed costs include computer hardware and software, developmentlabor, and computer usage costs incurred during development.andP;  Users providejudgments of benefits needed to justify an expanded system.andP;  If users justifynew cost thresholds, analysts modify the prototype to meet users' needs.andP;  Theprocess continues until users and analysts are satisfied that the bestsolution has been achieved.andM;This method has several disadvantages: some analysts do not have muchprototyping experience; the method's lack of an initial estimate of finalcosts and benefits may commit management to unexpected future expenditures;without &quot;final&quot; systems requirements, existing program revisions can besignificant; as with the incremental analysis method, benefits are based oncost avoidance and thus analysts cannot determine the actual amount ofavoided costs; and specific benefits, as in the incremental analysis method,are not identified.andM;Advantages of value analysis include quick user requirement identification;improved communication between analysts and users; incremental evaluation ofbenefits and costs, which enables management to continue or stop; anevolutionary approach, which results in user-tailored systems, providinggreater user satisfaction than traditionally developed systems; and theincremental identification and presentation of benefits associated with valueanalysis, which allows analysts to treat functions of systems as increments.andM;The expected value method differs from the previous two methods by using costreduction rather than cost avoidance.andP;  Analysts segment benefits into variousranges of cost reduction.andP;  The total existing cost is then multiplied by themidpoint of the range to determine the cost reduction/benefit of a range.andO;The cost reduction for the range is multiplied by probabilities of occurrenceto arrive at a probable savings.andP;  The sum of the probable savings from eachrange is the expected value for that benefit.andM;For example, the average annual downtime for a power plant is four weeks.andO;One week of downtime costs a utility $2 million.andP;  The availability of moretimely and accurate information will result in improved decisions regardingpower plant maintenance, which could reduce downtime (see &quot;The expected Valueof Quality IS&quot;).andM;Analysts with limited knowledge concerning power plant maintenance coulddetermine ranges of possible cost reduction and probabilities of occurrenceby using the Delphi or expert opinion methods outlined above.andM;The advantages of this technique include benefit verification afterimplementation due to cost reduction; identification and measurement ofspecific benefits; and documentation of users' and analysts' subjectivityused in arriving at estimates.andM;The excess tangible cost approach, as previously defined in DATAMATION byresearchers Steve Drummond and Charles Litecky, compares net tangible costswith various intangible benefits.andP;  It resembles break-even analysis,indicating the minimum value of intangible benefits necessary for a projectto break even.andM;Litecky identified four assumptions for using this method:andM;* Tangible costs and benefits are relatively easy to estimate.andM;* Intangible benefits are most difficult to estimate.andM;* Tangible costs are much greater than tangible benefits.andM;* Intangible costs are insignificant.andM;Two advantages of presenting net tangible and intangible benefits/costsseparately are that management can apply the value of intangible benefitssubjectively; and it educates management, especially conservative management,on the importance of intangible benefits (see &quot;The Excess Tangible CostMethod&quot;).andM;Worst/most-likely/best-case method.andP;  This method presents management withthree situations for qualitative benefits: the most pessimistic view, themost likely case, and the most optimistic view.andP;  In addition to having theadvantages of the excess tangible cost method, this method providesmanagement with upper and lower boundaries.andM;Using the power plant maintenance system example, a presentation using theworst/most-likely/best-case method can be made in the excess tangible costformat (see &quot;Proving the Cases for Quality IS&quot;).andM;The benefit profile chart approach is probably the most widely used method ofpresenting intangible benefits.andP;  The disadvantages of this approach include:analysts tend to use the checklist as the only method for identifyingintangible benefits and therefore neglect benefits not on the list; benefits'descriptions are usually abbreviated so that reviewers' interpretations canresult in misunderstanding or misperception; and checklists excludeidentification of how a post-implementation audit can verify benefits.andM;The advantages of this approach include easy implementation; versatility tomost applications; easy updates for new benefits; effective means ofcommunication with explicit benefit descriptions; and assurance that nobenefits are overlooked with a later checklist review.andM;Placing Proper EmphasisandM;Qualitative or intangible benefits constitute a larger portion of thebenefits planned for development today than in the past.andP;  Because intangiblebenefits may have a significant impact on organizations, analysts need toplace proper emphasis on identifying these benefits during analysis and needto present them to management in a manner that conveys their significance.andM;No single method identified here is best for all situations, but acombination of methods capitalizes on the advantages of each method used andminimizes the disadvantages of any one method.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
