The prognostic significance of tumor gradingand pelvic node involvement was analyzed. Five and 10-year survival forStage B was 100% and 85% respectively; for Stage C it was 68% and 43%respectively. The cumulative 94% local control rate for Stage B and Ccases obtained in this report suggests more effectiveness to controlthe disease locally with acceptable rate of complications, when radioactivegold seed implant is added.</TEXT></DOC>
