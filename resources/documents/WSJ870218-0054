Israel G. Grossman, 34 years old, allegedly leaked nonpublic information about Colt's plan to six relatives and friends before the market-sensitive information became public, helping the six make almost $1.5 million, the government charged.    The alleged insider-trading scheme, the government charged, occurred in July 1986 while Mr. Grossman was an associate at Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin andamp; Frankel, a respected Manhattan law firm that has been a growing presence on Wall Street. Mr. Grossman left Kramer Levin last September, and the government said the firm had &quot;cooperated fully&quot; in the case.    Since October Mr. Grossman has been an associate at Carter, Ledyard andamp; Milburn, where he was arrested yesterday morning.    The charges against Mr. Grossman were brought by U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani and in a related civil complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Grossman's six relatives and friends were charged in the SEC case, but weren't charged criminally.    While neither Mr. Grossman nor his attorney, Irving Seidman, would comment on the case, Mr. Seidman asserted in court yesterday that his client &quot;has been, is and will be a law-abiding citizen.&quot; Mr. Grossman made no comment at his court appearance and was released on $1 million bond.    The Grossman case was referred to the SEC by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, which noticed unusual trading in Colt options. The SEC said the case is unrelated to other recent insider cases such as Ivan F. Boesky's.    In the criminal complaint, Mr. Grossman formally was charged with securities fraud and mail fraud.    While he wasn't directly involved in the $1.5 billion Colt recapitalization, Mr. Grossman, a pension specialist, allegedly learned about the plan from a fellow attorney at Kramer Levin with whom he shared a secretary, the government charged. Mr. Grossman was charged with leaking the nonpublic information from the firm starting only a day after Kramer Levin began representing the New York-based industrial products company, on July 9, 1986. The law firm was retained to represent trustees of Colt's retirement savings plan.    In the week before the recapitalization announcement on July 20, the government charged, Mr. Grossman called his relatives and friends, who bought $34,000 in Colt options in anticipation of a rise in the company's common. Unknown yet to the public, the recapitalization plan had called for each Colt shareholder to receive $85 a share and a new share in the recapitalized company.    Colt common stock shot to $93.62 a share in one trading day from $66.75 after the recapitalization plan was announced, and Mr. Grossman's relatives and friends thus made $1.5 million, the SEC charged.    U.S. District Judge Shirley Wohl Kram yesterday ordered a freeze on Mr. Grossman's assets, but denied an SEC request for a temporary restraining order barring Mr. Grossman from further violations of securities laws.    Kramer Levin cooperated with the government probe, prosecutors said. Jeffrey Kalmus, a Kramer Levin partner, said the allegations against Mr. Grossman, if true, are &quot;a betrayal of our firm as well as a betrayal of public trust.&quot; Mr. Kalmus said Mr. Grossman had already been asked to leave the firm before the alleged insider-trading actions.    &quot;This is the first time something like this has happened&quot; at Kramer Levin, Mr. Kalmus said, adding that the firm is &quot;continuing our efforts to ensure the confidentiality of our clients.&quot; In a statement, Carter Ledgard said it has been assured that Mr. Grossman's &quot;allegedly unlawful actions occurred prior to his employment by our firm.&quot; A spokesman wouldn't comment on Mr. Grossman's status at Carter Ledgard, where he has worked on employee-benefits matters. </TEXT></DOC>
