Ten letters of commentswere received. Most of the letters commented on several issues.One commenter felt that recreation facilities, motels and tourism facilitiesshould be eligible for assistance. FmHA believes these facilities tendto be high risk, seasonal, and capital intensive relative to the numberof jobs created. They remain ineligible.One commenter suggested funds be allocated on a State or regional basis.Due to the small amount of funds available and the short time remainingin the fiscal year, FmHA still believes it is best to operate the programon a National basis from our National Office. The proposed rule will notbe changed.Four commenters asked that the eligibility requirements for intermediariesbe clarified or changed. The concern was to ensure that National and regionalintermediaries and electric co-ops are eligible for assistance. Section1948.103(a) has been revised to provide that private nonprofit corporationsmay be eligible without regard to the area they serve.  Five commenters objected to the requirement that the intermediary haveequity available for lending equal to 10 percent of the FmHA loan. FmHAagrees that some nonprofit organizations that should be considered forfunding may not able to meet this requirement and the requirement has beenremoved.  One commenter also objected to the requirements of andSection;1948.103(b)(3)(iv)regarding capitalization of the intermediary. FmHA believes that capitalizationis an important measure of an organization's financial strength and abilityto remain in operation and repay a loan. Therefore, it is retained as onefactor that will be considered in evaluating an applicant's ability tosuccessfully assist rural businesses.  Two commenters objected to the requirement that an intermediary have recentsuccessful experience in making and servicing loans. No change has beenmade on this issue. However, the rule states that intermediaries will ``normally''have such experience, so FmHA may make exceptions when it is justified. Three commenters requested that the description of eligible loan purposesbe broadened. One suggeted the term ``infrastructure'' be used and anotherexpressed concern about transportation facilities. Sections 1948.109 and1951.853 have been revised to include community development projects aseligible and to remove the requirement that transportation services beincidental to business development.  Four commenters objected to the prohibition on loans to churches, charitableinstitutions, and educational institutions. FmHA believes loans to suchorganizations tend to be financially weak and difficult to service. Thisprohibition is consistent with other FmHA programs and is retained. However,this does not prevent loans to all tax-exempt nonprofit organizations.Three commenters objected to the requirement that FmHA funds not be usedfor more than 75 percent of the cost of an ultimate recipient's project.Three commenters objected to the $150,000 limit on FmHA funds loaned toany one ultimate recipient. FmHA believes these requirements are neededto ensure that limited funds are shared among more recipients and thatloans are leveraged with funds from other sources. The requirement is retained.However, andSection;1948.100(a)(9) dealing with this subject has been revisedfor clarity.  Seven commenters objected to FmHA review of each loan from an intermediaryto an ultimate recipient. Four commenters where specifically concernedabout intergovernmental review procedures and three commenters were specificallyconcerned about the environmental review process. FmHA shares the concernsabout the potential impact of these reviews on processing time. However,we believe part of the concern is based on misunderstanding of the intentof the rule. FmHA does not intend to review the entire project file orto do a financial analysis for each loan to an ultimate recipient. Basicenvironmental review requirements are set out in the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act and in 7 CFR 1940, Subpart G. Intergovernmental consultationrequirements are set out in Executive Order 12372, 7 CFR 3015, SubpartV, and FmHA Instruction 1940-J (available in any FmHA office). FmHA isrequired to make those two reviews. In order to complete the environmentalreview, FmHA will have to know the exact loan purpose so it will be a simplematter to confirm that the proposed loan is for an eligible purpose. Whenthe intermediary intends to assign its interest in the security offeredby the ultimate recipient, as part of the security for the intermediary'sloan from FmHA, then FmHA will review the security. That is the extentof the review intended by FmHA. No change from the proposed rule has beenmade.  Six commenters questioned the procedure for disbursement of funds and requestedthat intermediaries be able to draw FmHA loan funds prior to the time theyare needed by an ultimate recipient. The disbursement procedure requestedby the commenters in contrary to general policy for the operation of Governmentloan programs and would increase the cost to the Government for operatingthe program. It also tends to encourage intermediaries to hold the fundsfor investment purposes rather than relending them to ultimate recipientsas intended by the program. For these reasons the disbursement procedureoutlines in the proposed rule is being retained.Four commenters objected to andSection;andSection; 1948.118(b)(8) and 1951.866(b),which require intermediaries to agree to provide additional security ifrequested by FmHA during the term of a loan. FmHA believes this requirementis necessary to protect the Government's interest. Many intermediarieswill not be able to pledge specific security for the term of the loan,but will be continuously adjusting and substituting security. These paragraphshave been revised for clarity.Two commenters questioned the need for all intermediaries to be approvedby the Governor of each State where they intend to operate. FmHA agreesthat this requirement may be an unnecessary burden. The requirement hasbeen removed.Two commenters wanted the $3 million limit on the amount of loan to oneintermediary removed. Due to the limited amount of funds expected for theprogram, FmHA believes a limit is needed to ensure that several applicantswill be able to share in the funds. The requirement, therefore, is retained.Two commenters requested clarification or removal of the prohibition onusing funds for a line of credit. A line of credit is not amortized. Theamount of debt may vary from week to week and after any period of time,the principal balance may be as large as it was in the beginning. Soundadministration of a line of credit requires close monitoring of borroweroperations, inventory and accounts receivable. Using IRP/RDLF funds fora line of credit would complicate loan servicing for both FmHA and theintermediary and the prohibition is retained. IRP/RDLF funds may be usedfor term working capital loans. No change is made to the proposed rule.Two commenters objected to the requirement that intermediaries agree tonot change their articles of incorporation, charter, or bylaws withoutFmHA concurrence. FmHA believes this safeguard is essential, as changesin organizational structure could effect an intermediary's eligiblity orlegal capacity to function and meet its agreements. The requirement isretained.Three commenters objected to requirements regarding life insurance on principalsand key employees. FmHA believes this requirement for life insurance onkey people is essential for a sound program and is a normal commerciallending practice. The requirement is retained.Two commenters objected to the prohibition on an ultimate recipient receivingfunds from more than one intermediary. No change in this requirement hasbeen made. FmHA believes an ultimate recipient should normally deal withonly one intermediary for purposes of sound credit and to share the availablefunds with more recipients. However, the restriction was written so thatit may be done with prior FmHA concurrence.One commenter objected to the prohibition in andSection; 1951.854(a)(10)on investment of loan funds. One commenter also objected to the restrictionin andSection; 1951.871(b) on uses of interest earned. Review of these twoparagraphs revealed an apparent conflict. Both paragraphs have been rewritten.RDLF loan funds may not be invested for more than 30 days without priorFmHA concurrence. Any RDLF loan funds that have not been used for loansto ultimate recipients within 6 months will be returned to FmHA. This isneeded to help ensure that the funds are used for the objectives of theprogram.Loan funds that are held temporarily and funds obtained from lending RDLFfunds and recollecting them, that are not needed immediately for relendingto ultimate recipients, should be placed in an insured interest-bearingdeposit. The restriction on the use of the interest earned on such accountsis retained to comply with andSection; 1951.853 and ensure that the loanresults in a revolving loan program.One commenter said FmHA should not require full collateral coverage. Therule states that loans to intermediaries will be adequately secured butleaves considerable flexibility for FmHA to determine what is adequateon a case-by-case basis. Any reduction in this requirement would leavethe Government's interest insufficiently protected. Section 1948.118(b)(2)has been revised to clarity security options.One commenter felt public agencies should not be eligible intermediaries.The authorizing legislation provides for loans to public and private nonprofitorganizations or agencies. No change has been made.One commenter suggested that ability to target benefits to low-income personsshould be an eligibility requirement for intermediaries. The rule statesthat priority will be given to applications from intermediaries that willprovide assistance to ultimate recipients that provide the greatest benefitto low-income persons, farm families, and displaced farm families. However,FmHA does not believe this should be a requirement of all intermediaries.No change has been made.One commenter objected to the requirement that FmHA determine that eachultimate recipient is unable to obtain adequate financing elsewhere. FmHAagrees that this implies a more thorough review of the ultimate recipientby FmHA than intended. Section 1948.103(c)(2) has been revised so thatthe intermediary may make the determination. The same commenter suggestedthat the requirement that the intermediary be unable to obtain other creditbe removed. This is a statutory requirement and no change has been made.One commenter requested that recipients of 1983 Rural Development LoanFunds (RDLF) should be excluded from the $3 million cap on loans to intermediaries.FmHA does not see any justification for treating previous RDLF borrowersdifferently from other potential applicants and wishes to ensure that thelimited funds will be shared by several organizations. No change has beenmade.One commenter suggested alternative language in andSection; 1948.109(b)(1)(ii)regarding assistance to low-income persons and displaced farm families.FmHA believes the language used accomplishes the intended purpose and nochange has been made.One commenter suggested that intermediaries be allowed to guarantee bankloans. FmHA believes that including loan guarantees would further complicatethe program and make servicing more difficult. No change has been made.One commenter suggested language that apparently would allow intermediariesto make loans to ultimate recipients located in nonrural areas if theywould employ or benefit rural people. FmHA believes that requiring ultimaterecipients to be located in rural areas will help to ensure maximum benefitsto rural residents. No change has been made.One commenter suggested that RDLF/IRP deposited funds be utilized to guaranteea bank line of credit. FmHA believes that only direct loans would be madewith the use of Federal funds from the program and that lines of creditwould complicate loan servicing for both FmHA and the intermediary. Therefore,the prohibition is retained. IRP/RDLF funds may be used for term workingcapital loans.One commenter suggested a 5-year deferral of principal payments in orderto allow for buildup of reserves. FmHA believes that a deferment of principalpayment up to 3 years should provide adequate time for the intermediaryto establish a financially viable revolving loan program and that a 5-yeardeferment is excessive. This requirement is retained. One commenter suggested that language regarding commitments of financialsupport from public agencies and private organizations be eliminated. FmHAbelieves that an important measure of an organization's financial strengthand abilities is that it be able to secure other needed funds in implementinga sound loan program. Therefore, it is retained as one factor that willbe considered in evaluating an applicant.One commenter suggested that FmHA target funds to ``other low income targetedpopulations such as AFDC recipients and dislocated workers.'' FmHA in itsinstruction targets ``low-income persons'' which would in most instancesinclude AFDC recipients and dislocated workers. Thus, no change from theproposed rule has been made.One commenter suggested that the requirement for cash flow projectionsin applications be rewritten to require more frequent projections of cashflow monthly for 1 year and quarterly for 2 more years. FmHA agrees thiswould be desirable for analysis. However, such a reporting requirementmay be too much of a burden on applicants to make it a minimum requirement.The requirement for 3 years of annual cash flow projections is retained.One commenter requested that there should be an application deadline tofile an IRP loan application. FmHA believes a deadline on the receipt ofIRP applications is not necessary. This is to ensure that the applicationprocess is open to all qualified applicants and reviewed in the order thatthe applications were received. The request is denied.One commenter commented on FmHA procedures in andSection; 1948.123(d) regardingtimeframes for processing applications and suggested that FmHA amend thissection to apply to projects above $150,000 or 10 percent of the principalloan balance. This section contains instructions on the time limit in processingthe IRP application by FmHA and does not apply to the FmHA concurrencerequired on loans made by the intermediary to an ultimate recipient. Therequirement is related.FmHA has made several minor revisions from the proposed rule to clarifythe regulation and adjust internal operating procedures. The definitionof a debtor is not needed and has been removed. Sections 1948.101(b), 1948.109(a),1948.110(a)(1), 1951.853(a), and 1951.854(a)(1) have been revised to clarifythat FmHA loan funds must be used by intermediaries to relend to ultimaterecipients and may not be used by the intermediaries for their own administrativeexpenses or for providing guarantees or other technical and financial assistance.This is a revision in language for clarity, and not a change in the intentof the rule. Sections 1948.125 (c), (e), (f), and (g) have been revisedregarding the procedures for obligating a loan. This is a change in internalFmHA procedures and has no effect on the public. Sections 1948.113(d) and1951.866(c) regarding appraisals, andSection;andSection; 1948.117(a) and 1951.872(a)regarding intergovernmental consultation, andSection;1948.122(b)(9) regardingwork plans, andSection; 1948.123(d) regarding processing time, andSection;andSection;1948.124(c)(2) and 1948.126(b)(4) regarding adverse changes in intermediaries,and 1951.866(a) regarding security, have all been revised for clarity.Sections 1951.867, 1951.883, 1951.884, 1951.890, 1951.866(c), 1951.871(b),and 1951.877(b) have been revised to make the language in 1951-R conformto the language used in 1948-C on the same subjects. No change in the meaningof the rule is intended. Section 1951.872(b)(2) has been removed. Thisparagraph contained environmental requirements which are applicable tonew loans to intermediaries but not to loans from intermediaries to ultimaterecipients. It was included in the proposed rule in error. Revisions havebeen made in Subparts A, B, and C of Part 1955 to include references tothe Nonprofit National Corporations program.

This assessmentwill focus on the potential cumulative impacts of the projects as wellas any environmental concerns or problems that are associated with individualprojects and that can be identified at this time from the information submitted.Because neither the completion of the environmental assessment nor theapproval of the application is an FmHA commitment to the use of loan fundsfor a specific project, no public notification requirements for a ClassII assessment will apply to the application. The affected public has notbeen sufficiently identified at this stage of the FmHA review. Should anapplication be approved, each project to be assessed will undergo the applicableenvironmental review and public notification requirements in Subpart Gof Part 1940 of this Chapter prior to FmHA's consent to use loan fundsfor an ultimate recipient. FmHA will prepare an Environmental Impact Statementfor any application for a loan determined to have a significant effecton the quality of the human environment.

L. 99-198, section 1323 of the FoodSecurity Act of 1985, there were provisions that affected the interestrates on those loans.(1) Those loans made in 1980 and 1981 carried an original note rate of1 percent interest when they were first issued. The legislation providesfor those loans made in 1980 and 1981 to have a permanent interest ratereduction to 1 percent effective December 23, 1985, to maturity. However,the interest rates on the loans made in 1983 and 1984 may remain the sameas the original note rate.(2) Loans made in 1983 and 1984 do not automatically qualify for a lowerrate than the level of interest rates when the notes were first issued.Section 407 of Pub. L. 99-425 provides for a weighted average requirementthat would affect those loans made in 1983 and 1984 to intermediary borrowers.(3) In those cases where loans were made in RDLF intermediaries and theweighted average of all loans made by the RDLF intermediary after December31, 1982, does not exceed the sum of 6 percent plus the interest rate tothe intermediary (7 percent), the interest rate to be charged the RDLFintermediary will be the rate charged on such loans made in 1980, or 1percent. Should the weighted average exceed 7 percent, the note rate willcontrol.(i) In order for FmHA to determine the weighted average of the loan portfolio,the RDLF intermediary will be required to complete a weighted loan averagerate on its outstanding portfolio. The schedule prepared for FmHA's reviewshould include:(A) Calculations of the interest amount scheduled to accrue on each loanoutstanding over a 1-year period based on the current interest rate ofeach ultimate recipient's loan.(B) The sum total of interest on each individual loan will be added togetherto determine the total interest amount scheduled to accrue over a 1-yearperiod.(C) Divide the total of paragraph (a)(2) of this section by the total principaloutstanding to determine the average interest percent yield in the intermediary'sloan portfolio.(D) The loans to be included in determining the weighted interest averagewill be those made from January 1, 1983, forward.(E) FmHA will use the anniversary date of October 1 of each year to requestthe intermediary to complete a weighted interest average to determine theinterest rate on its RDLF loan for the coming calendar year, January 1through December 31. All loans made in 1980 and 1981 have had the interestrate permanently reduced by legislation to 1 percent, effective December25, 1985.(F) The weighted loan average interest rate on the outstanding loan portfolioas referenced in this section will be forwarded to FmHA along with sufficientdocumentation which should include calculations, list of outstanding loans,current interest rate being charged on the loan, etc.(b) Interest rates charged by intermediaries to the ultimate recipientsshall be at rates negotiated by those parties. Intermediaries are encouragedto make loans to ultimate recipients at the lowest possible rate, takinginto account the cost of the loan funds to the intermediary and the costof administering the loan portfolio.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;andSection;  1951.861-1951.865</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1951.866</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Security.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Loans from RDLF intermediaries to ultimate recipients. </T3>Securityrequirements for loans from intermediaries to ultimate recipients willbe negotiated between the intermediaries and ultimate recipients.

Audits shall be due 90 daysfollowing the audit period. Audits must cover all of the intermediary'sactivities. Audits will be performed by an independent certified publicaccountant or by an independent public accountant licensed and certifiedon or before December 31, 1970, by a regulatory authority of a State orother political subdivision of the United States. An acceptable audit willbe performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards andinclude such tests of the accounting records as the auditor considers necessaryin order to express an opinion on the financial condition of the intermediary.FmHA does not require an unqualified audit opinion as a result of the audit.Compilations or reviews do not satisfy the audit requirement.(2) Quarterly reports for periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30,and December 31 (due 30 days after the end of the period).

No one classification shouldbe viewed as more important than others. The uncollectibility aspect ofDoubtful and Loss classifications is of obvious importance. However, thefunction of the Substandard classification is to indicate those loans thatare unduly risky which may result in future losses. Substandard, Doubtfuland Loss are adverse classifications. The special mention classificationis for loans which are not adversely classified but which require the attentionand followup of FmHA. The loans will be classified as follows: (a) <T3>Seasoned loan classification. </T3>To be classified as a seasoned loan,a loan must: (1) Have a remaining principal loan balance of two-thirds or less of theoriginal aggregate of all existing loans made to that intermediary. (2) Be in compliance with all loan conditions and FmHA regulations. (3) Have been current on the loan(s) payments for 24 consecutive months.(4) Be secured by collateral which is determined to be adequate to ensurethere will be no loss on the loan. (b) <T3>Current non-problem classification. </T3>This classification includesthose loans which have been current for less than 24 consecutive monthsand are in compliance with the loan conditions and FmHA regulations, andare not considered to pose a credit risk to FmHA. These loans would beclassified as seasoned but for the ``24 months'' and ``two-thirds'' requirementsfor seasoned loans. (c) <T3>Special mention classification. </T3>This classification includes loanswhich do not presently expose FmHA to a sufficient degree of risk to warranta Substandard classification but do possess credit deficiencies deservingFmHA's close attention because the failure to correct these deficienciescould result in greater risk in the future. This classification would includeloans that may be high quality, but which FmHA is unable to supervise properlybecause of an inadequate loan agreement, the condition or lack of controlover the collateral, failure to obtain proper documentation or any otherdeviations from prudent lending practices. Adverse trends in the intermediary'soperation or an imbalanced position in the balance sheet which has notreached a point that jeopardizes the repayment of the loan should be assignedto this classification. Loans in which actual, not potential, weaknessesare evident and significant should be considered for a Substandard classification.(d) <T3>Substandard classification. </T3>This classification includes loanswhich are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and payingcapacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans inthis classification must have a well defined weakness or weaknesses thatjeopardize the payment in full of the debt. If the deficiencies are notcorrected, there is a distinct possibility that FmHA will sustain someloss.(e) <T3>Doubtful classification. </T3>This classification includes those loanswhich have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandardwith the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidationin full, based on currently known facts, conditions and values, highlyquestionable and improbable.(f) <T3>Loss classification. </T3>This classification includes those loanswhich are considered uncollectible and of such little value that theircontinuance as loans is not warranted. Even though partial recovery maybe effected in the future, it is not practical or desirable to defer writingoff these basically worthless loans.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;andSection; 1951.886-1951.888</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1951.889</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Transfer and assumption.</ITAG>(a) All transfers and assumptions must be approved in advance in writingby FmHA.
