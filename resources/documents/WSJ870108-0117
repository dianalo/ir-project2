Buchanan sat back in his West Wing office, smiled heartily and confessed, &quot;I enjoyed it.&quot;    While most other White House officials have been taking cover since the Iran-Contra affair broke, Mr. Buchanan, a longtime devotee of political combat, has taken to the ramparts. His controversial remarks have piqued less-combative White House officials, and prompted White House spokesman Larry Speakes to put out disclaimers suggesting the communications director has been speaking only for himself.    But his pugnacious rhetoric has energized the conservative movement, which has been deeply dispirited by the Iranian disclosures. Moreover, it now seems to have presented a possible new direction for Mr. Buchanan: his own bid for the Republican presidential nomination.    &quot;I'm intrigued by the idea, and I think you have to make a decision by March 1 at the latest,&quot; Mr. Buchanan said in an interview. Often frustrated by the constraints on his ability to speak freely from the White House, and worried about perceived disarray within the conservative movement, Mr. Buchanan says he is serious, even though he has never before sought or held an elective office.    In the next two weeks, Mr. Buchanan plans to grapple with what he sees as two major stumbling blocks. The first is funding. Facing potential opponents with multimillion-dollar war chests, Mr. Buchanan's chief hope so far is an offer of financial help from the Congressional Club, North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms's mass-mailing political machine. &quot;I am finding a lot of conservatives are excited about Pat Buchanan running for president -- I think this is the only way to unite the conservative movement,&quot; says Carter Wrenn, director of the Congressional Club. He says he hopes its members can raise $9 million for Mr. Buchanan.    Mr. Buchanan's second major concern is that his candidacy would inevitably fracture conservative support, ultimately scuttling chances for a conservative to win the nomination, and that leads many political strategists to conclude it's unlikely he'd run. As one conservative strategist sees the problem, &quot;Pat could never win -- but he could cause a lot of mischief.&quot;    Mr. Buchanan worries aloud about the impact that his potential candidacy might have on New York Rep. Jack Kemp and television evangelist Pat Robertson, both of whom he calls &quot;friends.&quot; But those close to Mr. Buchanan, like his sister and former U.S. Treasurer Angela &quot;Bay&quot; Buchanan Jackson, who is urging him to run, say that &quot;Jack Kemp has had his chance and he hasn't taken off.&quot;    John Buckley, a spokesman for the Kemp campaign, dismisses the threat of a Buchanan bid. &quot;I'm not overly concerned about it,&quot; he says. &quot;Running for president takes a lot of spadework, and it's late for somebody to start thinking about it.&quot;    But Mr. Buchanan sounds sorely tempted. Musing on the opportunity, he says: &quot;For the first time in my life, the movement is all over the lot. It doesn't know where it is, or who it's going with. Out there, people are looking, but they don't like what they see.&quot;    Presidential reveries aside, it's clear that the Iran-Contra affair has given new lease, and apparently new license, to the White House communications director. &quot;You can tell Pat's having fun for the first time, and it's good to see,&quot; says former White House speechwriter and Buchanan friend Peggy Noonan.    Mr. Buchanan's latest blitz, delivered to a pro-Reagan rally here Monday, was an all-out assault on both congressional liberals and the media, whom Mr. Buchanan accused of prolonging and exploiting the Iran-Contra controversy for their own political gain. The speech, which cast the growing scandal as a partisan fist fight, followed an explosive Dec. 8 Washington Post Op-Ed piece in which he accused Republicans who questioned the White House of lacking &quot;elemental loyalty&quot; to the president.    Asked whether he was supposed to clear these public remarks with White House authorities, Mr. Buchanan says, &quot;Yes.&quot; Asked if he did so, he says, smiling, &quot;No.&quot; Those close to Mr. Buchanan reason that White House authorities would never have consented to some of the more controversial statements he has made. But with Chief of Staff Donald Regan weakened and preoccupied by the current controversy, less control is now being exercised over such matters.    And even though aides to Mr. Regan have been sniping fiercely at Mr. Buchanan in the press, suggesting he has &quot;out-Agnewed Agnew,&quot; they are unsure how to regain the political initiative. And even as they flail, some admit Mr. Buchanan has served a useful purpose by acting as a lightning rod to deflect criticism.    The tactical dispute between Mr. Buchanan's combative style and the Regan camp's more conciliatory style strikes at the heart of a White House quandary over how to proceed through the next year. Conservatives fear that if the White House doesn't aggressively seize the initiative in the remaining days before the Jan. 27 State of the Union message, their gains and their future may be jeopardized by the Democratic Congress.    &quot;I think this is a real crisis,&quot; says Stuart Butler, director of domestic policy studies for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. &quot;Either the White House can take the direction of preoccupying itself with damage control, or it can go on the offensive and capture the debate. Right now, Pat Buchanan seems to be the only one taking an aggressive tone.&quot;    But Mr. Buchanan swears -- as he has before -- that he's about to lower his profile. He says about his Monday speech, &quot;I probably should have toned it down some,&quot; and he says about his plans, &quot;It would be a mistake to think that I'm going to be out there a lot in the next couple of months.&quot;    One reason, he says, is that the battle over shaping the State of the Union message, which will provide a crucial blueprint of where the Reagan administration is going, has to be fought quietly and internally. &quot;It's real inside baseball, and I've got a job here as a staff member,&quot; he says. But then, before he can catch himself, he's spoiling for another good fight. &quot;What if we came out in the speech with a date certain for deploying SDI?,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
