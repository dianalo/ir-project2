Meaningful developmentsare traced in this review of C-14 dating by gas proportional (GP) andliquid scintillation (LS) spectrometry. The performance of characteristicas well as state of the art GP and LS systems is tabulated and theirmerit for low-level counting of C-14 is evaluated. Future developmentsin radiometry will lie in the updating of existing systems to incorporatenew technologies and the refinement of resolution and identificationof extreme low-level signals. Parallel development with AMS, sharingon merit the ever widening applied C-14 research field, and enhancedinterdisciplinary collaboration are foreseen as the scenario leadingto the year 2000.</TEXT></DOC>
