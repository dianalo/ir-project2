L. 95-602, 92 Stat.2982) and the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-506, 100Stat. 1810), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 states that:<ITAG tagnum="21">No otherwise qualified individual with handicaps in the United States,* * * shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be excluded from the participationin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination underany program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance <T3>or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agencyor by the United States Postal Service. The head of each such agency shallpromulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the amendmentsto this section made by the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, andDevelopmental Disabilities Act of 1978. Copies of any proposed regulationshall be submitted to appropriate authorizing committees of Congress, andsuch regulation may take effect no earlier than the thirtieth day afterthe date on which such regulation is so submitted to such committees.</T3></ITAG>The substantive nondiscrimination obligations of the Agency, as set forthin this proposed rule, are identical, for the most part, to those establishedby Federal regulations for programs or activities receiving Federal financialassistance. (<T3>See</T3> 28 CFR Part 41, the section 504 coordination regulation forfederally assisted programs). This general parallelism is in accord withthe intent expressed by supporters of the 1978 amendment in floor debate,including its sponsor, Rep. James M. Jeffords, that the Federal Governmentshould have the same section 504 obligations as recipients of Federal financialassistance. 124 Cong. Rec. 13,901 (1978) (remarks of Rep. Jeffords); 124Cong. Rec. E2668, E2670 (daily ed. May 17, 1978) <T3>id</T3>.; 124 Cong. Rec. 13,897 (remarks of Rep. Brademas); <T3>id.</T3> at 38,552 (remarks of Rep. Sarasin).The Agency has proposed a slightly modified version of proposed rules toprovide for the enforcement of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of1973, as amended. The purpose of the variation is to assure that the amendmentis enforced, as applied to the Central Intelligence Agency, in a mannerconsistent with the Agency's mission; the National Security Act of 1947(50 U.S.C. 402 <T3>et seq.</T3>), as amended; and other applicable law. In addition, thereare some language differences between this proposed rule and the FederalGovernment's section 504 regulations for federally assisted programs. Thesechanges are based on the Supreme Court's decision in <T3>Southeastern Community College v. Davis</T3>, 442 U.S. 397 (1979),and the subsequent circuit court decisions interpreting <T3>Davis</T3> and section 504. <T3>See, Dopico v. Goldschmidt,</T3> 687 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982); <T3>American Public Transit Association v. Lewis, </T3>655 F.2d 1272 (D.C.Cir. 1981) <T3>(APTA); see also Rhode Island Handicapped Action Committee v. RhodeIsland Public Transit Authority,</T3> 718 F.2d 490 (1st Cir. 1983).These language differences are also supported by the decision of the SupremeCourt in <T3>Alexander v. Choate,</T3> 469 U.S. 287 (1985), in which the Court heldthat the regulations for federally assisted programs did not require arecipient to modify its durational limitation on Medicaid coverage of inpatienthospital care for handicapped persons. Clarifying its <T3>Davis</T3> decision, the Court explained that section 504 requiresonly ``reasonable'' modifications, <T3>id.</T3> at 300, and explicitly noted that ``[the] regulations implementingandSection; 504 [for federally assisted programs] are consistent with theview that <T3>reasonable</T3> adjustments in the nature of the benefit offered mustat times be made to assure meaningful access'' <T3>id.</T3> 301 n.21 (emphasis added).Incorporation of these changes, therefore, makes this regulation implementingsection 504 for federally conducted programs consistent with the FederalGovernment's regulations implementing section 504 for federally assistedprograms as they have been interpreted by the Supreme Court. Many of thesefederally assisted regulations were issued prior to the interpretationsof section 504 by the Supreme Court in <T3>Davis,</T3> by lower courts interpreting <T3>Davis,</T3> and by the Supreme Court in <T3>Alexander;</T3> therefore, their language does not reflect the interpretationof section 504 provided by the Supreme Court and by the various circuitcourts. Thus, because the Agency interprets the federally assisted regulationsto reflect the judicial rulings described earlier, the Agency believesthat there are no significant differences between this proposed rule forfederally conducted programs and the Federal Government's interpretationof section 504 regulations for federally assisted programs.This regulation has been reviewed by the Department of Justice. It is anadaptation of a prototype prepared by the Department of Justice under ExecutiveOrder 12250 (45 FR 72995, 3 CFR, 1980 Comp., p. 298) and distributed toExecutive agencies. This regulation has also been reviewed by the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission under Executive Order 12067 (43 FR 28967,3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 206).<T3>Executive Order 12291:</T3> These regulations have been reviewed inaccordance with Executive Order 12291. They are not classified as majorbecause they do not meet the criteria for major regulations establishedin the Order.<T3>Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification:</T3> The Director of theCentral Intelligence Agency certifies that these proposed regulations wouldnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. These regulations apply only to programs or activities conductedby the Central Intelligence Agency.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis</ITAG>Section 1904.101 PurposeSection 1904.101 states the purpose of the proposed rule, which is to effectuatesection 119 of the Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and DevelopmentalDisabilities Amendments of 1978, which amended section 504 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of handicap in programsor activities conducted by Executive agencies or the United States PostalService.Section 1904.102 ApplicationThe regulation applies to all programs or activities conducted by the Agency.Under this section, a federally conducted program or activity is, in simpleterms, anything a federal agency does. Aside from employment, there aretwo major categories of federally conducted programs or activities coveredby this regulation: those involving general public contact as part of ongoingAgency operations and those directly administered by the Agency for programbeneficiaries and participants. Activities in the first category includecommunication with the public (telephone contacts, office walk-ins, orinterviews) and the public's use of the Agency's facilities. Activitiesin the second category include programs that provide Federal services orbenefits. This regulation does not, however, apply to programs or activitiesconducted outside the United States that do not involve individuals withhandicaps in the United States. This regulation will apply to the Agencyonly to the extent consistent with the National Security Act of 1947 (50U.S.C. 402 <T3>et seq</T3>.), as amended; the Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949(50 U.S.C. 403a <T3>et seq.</T3>), as amended; and other applicable law. Nor shall anythingin the regulation be deemed to impair the Director's responsibility forprotecting intelligence sources and methods.Section 1904.103 Definitions``Assistant Attorney General'' means the Assistant Attorney General, CivilRights Division, United States Department of Justice.``Auxiliary aids.'' ``Auxiliary aids'' means services or devices that enablepersons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills to have an equalopportunity to participate in and enjoy the benefits of the Agency's programsor activities. The definition provides examples of commonly used auxiliaryaids. Although auxiliary aids are required explicitly only by andSection;1904.160(a)(1), they also may be necessary to meet other requirements ofthe regulation. The Agency may prohibit from any of its facilities anyauxiliary aid, or category of auxiliary aid, that the Office of Security(OS) determines creates a security risk or potential security risk. OSreserves the right to examine any auxiliary aid brought into an Agencyfacility.``Complete complaint.'' ``Complete complaint'' is defined to include allthe information necessary to enable the Agency to investigate the complaint.The definition is necessary because the 180 day period for the Agency'sinvestigation (<T3>see </T3>andSection; 1904.170(g)) begins when it receives a completecomplaint. ``Director'' refers to the Director of Central Intelligence or an officialor employee of the Agency acting for the Director under a delegation ofauthority.``Facility.'' The definition of ``facility'' is similar to that in thesection 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs, 28CFR 41.3(f), except that the term ``rolling stock or other conveyances''has been added and the phrase, ``or interest in such property,'' is deletedbecause the term ``facility,'' as used in this regulation, refers to structuresand not to intangible property rights. It should, however, be noted thatthe regulation applies to all programs and activities conducted by theAgency regardless of whether the facility in which they are conducted isowned, leased, or used on some other basis by the Agency.``Individual with handicaps.'' The definition of ``individual with handicaps''is identical to the definition of ``handicapped person'' appearing in thesection 504 coordination regulation for federally assisted programs (28CFR 41.31). Although section 103(d) of the Rehabilitation Act Amendmentsof 1986 changed the statutory term ``handicapped individual'' to ``individualwith handicaps,'' the legislative history of this amendment indicates thatno substantive change was intended. Thus, although the term has been changedin this regulation to be consistent with the statute, as amended, the definitionis unchanged. In particular, although the term as revised refers to ``handicaps''in the plural, it does not exclude persons who have only one handicap.``Qualified individual with handicaps.'' The definition of ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' is a revised version of the definition of ``qualifiedhandicapped person'' appearing in the section 504 coordination regulationfor federally assisted programs (28 CFR 41.32).Paragraph (1) deviates from existing regulations for federally assistedprograms because of intervening court decisions. It defines ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' with regard to any program under which a personis required to perform services or to achieve a level of accomplishment.In those programs, a qualified individual with handicaps is one who canachieve the purpose of the program without modifications in the programthat the Agency can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alterationin its nature. This definition reflects the decision of the Supreme Courtin <T3>Davis. </T3>In that case, the Court ruled that a hearing-impaired applicantto a nursing school was not a ``qualified handicapped person'' becauseher hearing impairment would prevent her from participating in the clinicaltraining portion of the program. The Court found that, if the program weremodified so as to enable the respondent to participate (by exempting herfrom the clinical training requirements), ``she would not receive evena rought equivalent of the training a nursing program normally gives.''<T3>Id. </T3>at 410. It also found that ``the purpose of [the] programwas to train persons who could serve the nursing profession in all customaryways,'' <T3>id. </T3>at 413, and that the respondent would be unable, because ofher hearing impairment, to perform some functions expected of a registerednurse. It, therefore, concluded that the school was not required by section504 to make such modifications that would result in ``a fundamental alterationin the nature of the program.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 410.We have incorporated the Court's language in the definition of ``qualifiedindividual with handicaps'' in order to make clear that such a person mustbe able to participate in the program offered by the Agency. The Agencyis required to make modifications in order to enable an applicant withhandicaps to participate, but is not required to offer a program of a fundamentallydifferent nature. The test is whether, with appropriate modifications,the applicant can achieve the purpose of the program offered; not whetherthe applicant could benefit or obtain results from some other program thatthe Agency does not offer. Although the revised definition allows exclusionof some individuals with handicaps from some programs, it requires thatan individual with handicaps who is capable of achieving the purpose ofthe program must be accommodated, provided that the modifications do notfundamentally alter the nature of the program.The Agency has the burden of demonstrating that a proposed modificationwould constitute a fundamental alteration in the nature of its programor activity. Furthermore, in demonstrating that a modification would resultin such an alteration, the Agency must follow the procedures establishedin andSection;andSection;1904.150(a) and 1904.160(d), which are discussed below,for demonstrating that an action would result in undue financial and administrativeburdens. That is, the decision must be made by the Director or his or herdesignee in writing after consideration of all resources available forthe program or activity and must be accompanied by an explanation of thereasons for the decision. If the Director determines that an action wouldresult in a fundamental alteration, the Agency must consider options thatwould enable the individual with handicaps to achieve the purpose of theprogram but would not result in such an alteration.For programs or activities that do not fall under the first paragraph,paragraph (2) adopts the existing definition of ``qualified handicappedperson'' with respect to services (28 CFR 41.32(b)) in the coordinationregulation for programs receiving Federal financial assistance. Under thisdefinition, a qualified individual with handicaps is an individual withhandicaps who meets the essential eligibility requirements for participationin the program or activity.Paragraph (3) explains that ``qualified individual with handicaps'' means``qualified handicapped person'' as that term is defined for purposes ofemployment in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's regulationat 29 CFR 1613.702(f), which is made applicable to this part by andSection;1904.140.Nothing in this part changes existing regulations applicable to employment.``Section 504.'' This definition makes clear that, as used in this regulation,``Section 504'' applies only to programs or activities conducted by theAgency and not to programs or activities to which it provides Federal financialassistance.Section 1904.110 Self-evaluationThe Agency shall conduct a self-evaluation of its compliance with section504 within one year of the effective date of this regulation. The self-evaluationrequirement is present in the existing section 504 coordination regulationfor programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance (28 CFR41.5(b)(2)). Experience has demonstrated the self-evaluation process tobe a valuable means of establishing a working relationship with individualswith handicaps that promotes both effective and efficient implementationof section 504.Section 1904.111 NoticeSection 1904.111 requires the Agency to disseminate sufficient informationto employees, applicants, participants, beneficiaries, and other interestedpersons to apprise them of rights and protections afforded by section 504and this regulation. Methods of providing this information include, forexample, the publication of information in handbooks, manuals, and pamphletsthat are distributed to the public to describe the Agency's programs andactivities; the display of informative posters in service centers and otherpublic places; or the broadcast of information by television or radio.Section 1904.130 General prohibitions against discriminationSection 1904.130 is an adaptation of the corresponding section of the section504 coordination regulation for programs or activities receiving Federalfinancial assistance (28 CFR 41.51).Paragraph (a) restates the nondiscrimination mandate of section 504. Theremaining paragraphs in andSection;1904.130 establish the general principlesfor analyzing whether any particular action of the Agency violates thismandate. These principles serve as the analytical foundation for the remainingsections of the regulation. If the Agency violates a provision in any ofthe subsequent sections, it will violate one of the general prohibitionsfound in andSection;1904.130. If there is no applicable subsequent provision,the general prohibitions stated in this section apply.Paragraph (b) of this section prohibits overt denials of equal treatmentof individuals with handicaps. The Agency may not refuse to provide anindividual with handicaps with an equal opportunity to participate in orbenefit from its program simply because the person is handicapped. Suchblatantly exclusionary practices often result from the use of irrebuttablepresumptions that absolutely exclude certain classes of disabled persons(<T3>e.g.</T3>, epileptics, hearing-impaired persons, persons with heartailments) from participation in programs or activities without regard toan individual's actual ability to participate. Use of an irrebuttable presumptionis permissible only when in all cases a physical condition by its verynature would prevent an individual from meeting the essential eligibilityrequirements for participation in the program or activity in question.It would be permissible, therefore, to exclude, without an individual evaluation,all persons who are blind in both eyes from eligibility for a license tooperate a commercial vehicle in interstate commerce; but it may not bepermissible to disqualify automatically all those who are blind in justone eye.In addition, section 504 prohibits more than just the most obvious denialsof equal treatment. It is not enough to admit persons in wheelchairs toa program if the facilities in which the program is conducted are inaccessible.Paragraph (b)(1)(iii), therefore, requires that the opportunity to participateor benefit afforded to an individual with handicaps be as effective asthat afforded to others. The later sections on program accessibility (andSection;andSection;1904.149-1904.151) and communications (andSection; 1904.160) are specificapplications of this principle. Despite the mandate of paragraph (d) that the Agency administer its programsand activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needsof qualified individuals with handicaps, paragraph (b)(1)(iv), in conjunctionwith paragraph (d), permits the Agency to develop separate or differentaids, benefits, or services if necessary to provide individuals with handicapswith an equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from the Agency'sprograms or activities. Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) requires that different orseparate aids, benefits, or services be provided only if necessary to ensurethat the aids, benefits, or services are as effective as those providedto others. Even if separate or different aids, benefits, or services wouldbe more effective, paragraph (b)(2) provides that a qualified individualwith handicaps still has the right to choose to participate in the programor activity that is not designed to accommodate individuals with handicaps.Paragraph (b)(1)(v) prohibits the Agency from denying a qualified individualwith handicaps the opportunity to participate as a member of a planningor advisory board.Paragraph (b)(1)(vi) prohibits the Agency from limiting a qualified individualwith handicaps in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, oropportunity enjoyed by others receiving any aid, benefit, or service.Paragraph (b)(3) prohibits the Agency from utilizing criteria or methodsof administration that deny individuals with handicaps access to the Agency'sprograms or activities. The phrase ``criteria or methods of administration''refers to official written Agency policies and to the actual practicesof the Agency. This paragraph prohibits both blatantly exclusionary policiesor practices and nonessential policies and practices that are neutral ontheir face, but deny individuals with handicaps an effective opportunityto participate.Paragraph (b)(4) specifically applies the prohibition enunciated in andSection;1904.130(b)(3) to the process of selecting sites for construction of newfacilities or existing facilities to be used by the Agency. Paragraph (b)(4)does not apply to construction of additional buildings at an existing site.Paragraph (b)(5) prohibits the Agency, in the selection of procurementcontractors, from using criteria that subject qualified individuals withhandicaps to discriminate on the basis of handicap.Paragraph (b)(6) prohibits the Agency from discriminating against qualifiedindividuals with handicaps on the basis of handicap in the granting oflicenses or certification. A person is a ``qualified individual with handicaps''with respect to licensing or certification if he or she can meet the essentialeligibility requirements for receiving the license or certification (<T3>see</T3> andSection; 1904.103).In addition, the Agency may not establish requirements for the programsor activities of licensees or certified entities that subject qualifiedindividuals with handicaps to discrimination on the basis of handicap.For example, the Agency must comply with this requirement when establishingsafety standards for the operations of licensees. In that case, the Agencymust ensure that standards that it promulgates do not discriminate againstthe employment of qualified individuals with handicaps in an impermissiblemanner.Paragraph (b)(6) does not extend section 504 directly to the programs oractivities of licensees or certified entities themselves. The programsor activities of Federal licensees or certified entities are not themselvesfederally conducted programs or activities nor are the programs or activitiesreceiving Federal financial assistance merely by virtue of the Federallicense or certificate. However, as noted above, section 504 may affectthe content of the rules established by the Agency for the operation ofthe program or activity of the licensee or certified entity, and therebyindirectly affect limited aspects of their operations.Paragraph (c) provides that programs conducted pursuant to Federal statuteor Executive order that are designed to benefit only individuals with handicapsor a given class of individuals with handicaps may be limited to thoseindividuals with handicaps.Paragraph (d), discussed above, provides that the Agency must administerprograms and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to theneeds of qualified individuals with handicaps, i.e., in a setting thatenables individuals with handicaps to interact with non-handicapped personsto the fullest extent possible.Section 1904.140 EmploymentSection 1904.140 prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap in employmentby the Agency. Courts have held that section 504, as amended in 1978, coversthe employment practices of Executive agencies. <T3>Gardner </T3>v.<T3> Morris, </T3>752 F.2d 1271, 1277 (8th Cir. 1985); <T3>Smith </T3>v.<T3> U.S. Postal Service, </T3>742 F.2d 257, 259-260 (6th Cir. 1984); <T3>Prewitt </T3>v.<T3> United States Postal Service, </T3>662 F.2d 292, 302-04 (5th Cir.1981). <T3>Contra McGuiness </T3>v.<T3> U.S. Postal Service, </T3>744 F.2d 1318, 1320-21 (7th Cir. 1984);<T3>Boyd </T3>v.<T3> U.S. Postal Service, </T3>752 F.2d 410, 413-14 (9th Cir. 1985).Courts uniformly have held that, in order to give effect to section 501of the Rehabilitation Act, which covers Federal employment, the administrativeprocedures of section 501 must be followed in processing complaints ofemployment discrimination under section 504. <T3>Smith, </T3>742 F.2d at 262; <T3>Prewitt, </T3>662 F.2d at 304. Accordingly, andSection; 1904.140 (Employment)of this rule adopts the definitions, requirements, and procedures of section501 as established in regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission(EEOC) at 29 CFR Part 1613. Responsibility for coordinating enforcementof Federal laws prohibiting discrimination in employment is assigned tothe EEOC by Executive Order 12067 (3 CFR Part 1978 Comp., p. 206). Underthis authority, the EEOC establishes government-wide standards on nondiscriminationin employment on the basis of handicap. In addition to this section, andSection;1904.170(b) specifies that the agency will use the existing EEOC proceduresto resolve allegations of employment discrimination.Section 1904.149 Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited Section 1904.149 states the general nondiscrimination principle underlyingthe program accessibility requirements of andSection;andSection; 1904.150 and1904.151.Section 1904.150 Program accessibility: Existing facilitiesThis regulation adopts, with certain modifications, the program-accessibilityconcept found in the existing section 504 coordination regulation for programsor activities receiving Federal financial assistance (28 CFR 41.57). Thus,andSection; 1904.150 requires that each Agency program or activity, whenviewed in its entirety, be readily accessible to and usable by individualswith handicaps. The regulation also makes clear that the Agency is notrequired to make each of its existing facilities accessible (andSection;1904.150(a)(1)). However, andSection; 1904.150, unlike 28 CFR 41.57, placesexplicit limits on the Agency's obligation to ensure program accessibility(andSection; 1904.150(a)(2)).Paragraph (a)(2) generally codifies recent case law that defines the scopeof the Agency's obligation to ensure program accessibility. This paragraphprovides that in meeting the program accessibility requirement the Departmentis not required to take any action that would result in a fundamental alterationin the nature of its program or activity or in undue financial and administrativeburdens. A similar limitation is provided in andSection; 1904.160(d). Thisprovision is based on the Supreme Court's holding in <T3>Southeastern Community College </T3>v.<T3> Davis, </T3>442 U.S. 397 (1979), that section 504 does not requiremodifications that would result in ``undue financial and administrativeburdens.'' 442 U.S. at 412. Since <T3>Davis, </T3>circuit courts have applied this limitation on a showingthat only one of the two ``undue burdens'' would be created as a resultof the modification sought to be imposed under section 504. <T3>See, e.g., Dopico </T3>v.<T3> Goldschmidt, </T3>687 F.2d 644 (2d Cir. 1982); <T3>American Public Transit Association </T3>v.<T3> Lewis (APTA), </T3>655 F.2d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1981).Paragraph (a)(2) and andSection; 1904.160(d) are also supported by the SupremeCourt's decision in <T3>Alexander </T3>v.<T3> Choate, </T3>469 U.S. 287 (1985). <T3>Alexander </T3>involved a challenge to the State of Tennessee's reductionof inpatient hospital care coverage under Medicaid from 20 to 14 days peryear. Plaintiffs argued that this reduction violated section 504 becauseit had an adverse impact on handicapped persons. The Court assumed withoutdeciding that section 504 reaches at least some conduct that has an unjustifiabledisparate impact on handicapped people, but held that the reduction wasnot ``the sort of disparate impact'' discrimination that might be prohibitedby section 504 or its implementing regulation. <T3>Id. </T3>at 299. Relying on <T3>Davis, </T3>the Court said that section 504 guarantees qualified handicappedpersons ``meaningful access to the benefits that the grantee offers,''<T3>id. </T3>at 301, and that ``<T3>reasonable adjustments </T3>in the nature of the benefits being offeredmust at times be made to assure meaningful access.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at n.21 (emphasis added). However, section 504 does not require`` `changes,' `adjustments,' or `modifications' to existing programs thatwould be `substantial' * * * or that would constitute `fundamental alteration[s]in the nature of a program'.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at n.20 (citations omitted). <T3>Alexander </T3>supports the position, based on <T3>Davis </T3>and the earlier, lower court decisions, that in some situations,certain accommodations for a handicapped person may so alter an agency'sprogram or activity, or entail such extensive costs and administrativeburdens that the refusal to undertake the accommodations is not discriminatory.Thus, failure to include such an ``undue burdens'' provision could leadto judicial invalidation of the regulation or reversal of a particularenforcement action taken pursuant to the regulation.This paragraph, however, does not establish an absolute defense; it doesnot relieve the Agency of all obligations to individuals with handicaps.Although the Agency is not required to take actions that would result ina fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in unduefinancial and administrative burdens, it nevertheless must take any othersteps necessary to ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefitsand services of the federally conducted program or activity.It is the Agency's view that compliance with andSection; 1904.150(a) wouldin most cases not result in undue financial and administrative burdenson the Agency. In determining whether financial and administrative burdensare undue, all of the Agency's resources available for use in the fundingand operation of the conducted program or activity should be considered.The burden of proving that compliance with andSection; 1904.150(a) wouldfundamentally alter the nature of a program or activity, or would resultin undue financial and administrative burdens, rests with the Agency. Thedecision that compliance would result in that alteration, or those burdens,must be made by the Director, or his or her designee, and must be accompaniedby a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. Anyperson who believes that he or she or any specific class of persons hasbeen injured by the Director's decision, or failure to make a decision,may file a complaint under the compliance procedures established in andSection;1904.170.Paragraph (b)(1) sets forth a number of means by which program-accessibilitymay be achieved, including redesign of equipment, reassignment of servicesto accessible buildings, and provision of aides. In choosing among methods,the Agency shall give priority consideration to those that will be consistentwith provision of services in the most integrated setting appropriate tothe needs of individuals with handicaps. Structural changes in existingfacilities are required only when there is no other feasible way to makethe Agency's program accessible. (It should be noted that ``structuralchanges'' include all physical changes to a facility; the term does notrefer only to changes to structural features, such as removal of or alterationsto a load-bearing structural member.) The Agency may comply with the programaccessibility requirement by delivering services at alternate accessiblesites or making home visits as appropriate.Paragraphs (c) and (d) establish time periods for complying with the programaccessibility requirement. As currently required for federally assistedprograms by 28 CFR 41.57(b), the Agency must make any necessary structuralchanges in facilities as soon as practicable, but in no event later thanthree years after the effective date of this regulation. If structuralmodifications are requried, a transition plan must be developed withinsix months of the effective date of this regulation. Aside from structuralchanges, all other necessary steps to achieve compliance must be takenwithin 60 days.Section 1904.151 Program accessibility: New construction and alterationsOverlapping coverage exists with respect to new construction and alterationsunder section 504 and the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended(42 U.S.C. 4151-4157). Section 1904.151 provides that those buildings thatare constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the Agencymust be designed, constructed, or altered to be readily accessible to andusable by individuals with handicaps in accordance with 41 CFR 101-19.600to 101-19.607. This standard was promulgated pursuant to the ArchitecturalBarriers Act of 1968, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157). It is appropriateto adopt the existing Architectural Barriers Act standard of section 504compliance because new and altered buildings subject to this regulationare also subject to the Architectural Barriers Act and because adoptionof the standard will avoid duplicative and possibly inconsistent standards.Existing buildings leased by the Agency after the effective date of thisregulation are not required by the regulation to meet accessibility standardssimply by virtue of being leased. They are subject, however, to the programaccessibility standards for existing facilities in andSection; 1904.150.To the extent that buildings are newly constructed or altered, they mustalso meet the new construction and alteration requirements of andSection;1904.151.Federal practice under section 504 has always treated newly leased buildingsas subject to the existing facility program accessibility standard. Unlikethe construction of new buildings where architectural barriers can be avoidedat little or no cost, the application of new construction standards toan existing building being leased raises the same prospect of retrofittingbuildings as the use of an existing Federal facility, and the Agency believesthe same program accessibility standard should apply to both owned andleased existing buildings.In <T3>Rose </T3>v. <T3>United States Postal Service</T3>, 744 F.2d 13355 (9th Cir. 1985),the Ninth Circuit held that the Architectural Barriers Act requires accessibilityat the time of lease. The <T3>Rose </T3>court did not address whether section 504 likewise requiresaccessibility as a condition of lease, and the case was remanded to theDistrict Court for, among other things, consideration of that issue. TheAgency may provide more specific guidance on section 504 requirements forleased buildings after the litigation is completed.Section 1904.160 CommunicationsSection 1904.160 requires the Agency to take appropriate steps to ensureeffective communication with personnel of other Federal entities, applicants,participants, and members of the public. These steps must include proceduresfor determining whether auxiliary aids are necessary under andSection; 1904.160(a)(1)to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participatein, and enjoy the benefits of, the Agency's program or activity. They mustalso include an opportunity for individuals with handicaps to request theauxiliary aids of their choice. This expressed choice must be given primaryconsideration by the agency (andSection; 1904.160(a)(1)(i)). The Agency shallhonor the choice unless it can demonstrate that another effective meansof communication exists or that use of the means chosen would not be requiredunder andSection; 1904.160(d). That paragraph limits the obligation of theagency to ensure effective communication in accordance with <T3>Davis</T3> and the circuit court opinions interpreting it (<T3>see supra</T3> preamble discussion of andSection; 1904.150(a)(3)). Unlessnot required by andSection; 1904.160(d), the agency shall provide auxiliaryaids at no cost to the individual with handicaps.The discussion of andSection; 1904.150(a), program accessibility: Existingfacilities, regarding the determination of undue financial and administrativeburdens, also applies to this section and should be referred to for a completeunderstanding of the Agency's obligation to comply with andSection; 1904.160.In some circumstances, a note pad and written materials may be sufficientto permit effective communication with a hearing-impared person. In manycircumstances, however, they may not be, particularly when the informationbeing communicated is complex or exchanged for a lengthy period of time(<T3>e.g., </T3>a meeting) or where the hearing-impaired applicant or participantis not skilled in spoken or written language. In these cases, a sign languageinterpreter may be appropriate. For vision-impaired persons, effectivecommunication might be achieved by several means, including readers andaudio recordings. In general, the Agency intends to inform the public of:(1) The communications services it offers to afford individuals with handicapsan equal opportunity to participate in or benefit from its programs oractivities; (2) the opportunity to request a particular mode of communication;and (3) the Agency's preferences regarding auxiliary aids if it can demonstratethat several different modes are effective.The Agency shall ensure effective communication with vision-impaired andhearing-impaired persons involved in hearings conducted by the Agency.Auxiliary aids must be afforded where necessary to ensure effective communicationat the proceedings. If sign language interpreters are necessary, the agencymay require that it be given reasonable notice prior to the proceedingof the need for an interpreter. Moreover, the Agency need not provide individuallyprescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devicesof a personal nature (andSection; 1904.160(a)(1)(ii)). For example, the Agencyneed not provide eyeglasses or hearing aids to applicants or participantsin its programs or activities. Similarly, the regulation does not requirethe Agency to provide wheelchairs to persons with mobility impairments.Paragraph (b) requires the Agency to provide information to individualswith handicaps concerning accessible services, activities, and facilities.Paragraph (c) requires the Agency to provide signs at inaccessible facilitiesthat direct users to locations with information about accessible facilities.Section 1904.170 Compliance proceduresParagraph (a) specifies that paragraphs (c) through (1) of this sectionestablish the procedures for processing complaints other than employmentcomplaints. Paragraph (b) provides that the Agency will process employmentcomplaints according to procedures established in existing regulationsof the EEOC (29 CFR Part 1613) pursuant to section 501 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791).Paragraph (c) designates the Director, Office of Equal Employment Opportunity,as the official responsible for coordinating implementation of this section.Complaints may be sent to the Central Intelligence Agency, Director, Officeof Equal Employment Opportunity, Washington, DC 20505.The Agency is required to accept and investigate all complete complaints(andSection; 1904.170(d)). If it determines that it does not have jurisdictionover a complaint, it shall promptly notify the complainant and make reasonableefforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate entity of the FederalGovernment (andSection; 1904.170(e)).Paragraph (f) requires the Agency to notify the Architectural and TransportationBarriers Compliance Board upon receipt of a complaint alleging that a buildingor facility subject to the Architectural Barriers Act was designed, constructed,or altered in a manner that does not provide ready access to and use byindividuals with handicaps.Paragraph (g) requires the Agency to provide to the complainant, in writing,findings of fact and conclusions of law, the relief granted if noncomplianceis found, and notice of the right to appeal (andSection; 1904.170(g)). Oneappeal within the Agency must be provided (andSection; 1904.170(i)). Theappeal will not be heard by the same person who made the initial determinationof compliance or noncompliance.Paragraph (1) permits the Agency to delegate its authority for investigatingcomplaints to other Federal agencies. However, the statutory obligationof the Agency to make a final determination of compliance or noncompliancemay not be delegated.<ITAG tagnum="84">Invitation to Comment</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regardingthese proposed regulations.All comments submitted in response to these proposed regulations will beavailable for public inspection, during and after the comment period, ata CIA Reading Room in the metropolitan Washington, DC area designated bythe CIA Information and Privacy Coordinator upon request.
