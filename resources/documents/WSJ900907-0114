The U.S. Senate this month will consider a bill that wouldrequire all post-secondary institutions that receive federalaid to publish annual security reports that include thenumber of violent crimes committed against students. Thereport would be distributed to students and universityemployees. Prospective applicants could receive theinformation upon request.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;People are looking at the Florida tragedy and realizingthis is a serious problem,&quot; says a Senate aide familiar withthe bill. &quot;We tend to look at higher institutions as idyllicplaces, but they can be dangerous environments. Too manypeople go off to college not thinking about it.&quot;   The drive to improve campus security is being spearheadedby Constance B. and Howard K. Clery Jr., a Bryn Mawr, Pa.,couple. In April 1986, their 19-year-old daughter Jeanne Annwas murdered in her Lehigh University dormitory by anotherstudent.   Ms. Clery's killer had no difficulty entering her dormthat morning. Three doors, with automatic locks, had beenpropped open by students having a party. And Ms. Clery lefther room unlocked because her roommate forgot the key.   In 1987, Josoph M. Henry was convicted of killing Ms.Clery. But the Clerys say they were shocked to learn at thetrial about the level of crime at Lehigh and lapses insecurity on the Bethlehem, Pa., campus.   The Clerys filed a $25 million negligence suit againstLehigh, which was settled for an undisclosed amount. Theyused the money to set up Security On Campus Inc., a nonprofitclearinghouse for information about campus crime. Theorganization published a booklet listing questions parentsand prospective students should ask colleges about security.The group also maintains a data base of appellate casesinvolving lawsuits against universities.   The Clerys have also lobbied state lawmakers to forcecolleges to disclose information about campus crimes. Tenstates, including Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Delaware andLouisiana, have enacted laws requiring universities andcolleges to publish three-year campus crime statistics.Similar bills are pending in 30 other states.   According to the Campus Violence Research Center at TowsonState University in Towson, Md., 639 sexual assaults, 2,598physical assaults and six homicides occurred on 368 collegecampuses in 1988, the latest year for which data areavailable. The center says that 80% of all campus crime iscommitted by students.   But the group and other experts say the figures don't givea complete picture of campus crime. Many schools report datathrough local police agencies, but the campus statisticsaren't itemized in the final reports. And the experts contendthat universities frequently discourage students fromreporting crimes out of concern for bad publicity.   While lawmakers say there has been no formal opposition tothe federal bill, concerns have been raised by educationalinstitutions that making crime information publicly availablemay encourage suits. In recent years, courts in California,New York, Florida and Massachusetts have held colleges anduniversities liable for failing to protect students fromforeseeable criminal activity.   Some lawyers feel that forcing universities to publishcrime statistics will make it easier to establish liability.&quot;In the past, when suing universities it has been difficultto establish how many rapes and murders occurred on campus.It will be far easier now to litigate the issue offoreseeability,&quot; says Jeffrey A. Newman of the Boston firmNewman, Durso andamp; Itzkowitz, which is handling 10 pending suitsagainst universities involving campus crime issues.   In addition, there is some wariness about the possiblemisuse of crime statistics. &quot;We support the spirit of thebill,&quot; says John Smeaton, assistant vice president forstudent affairs at Lehigh. &quot;But statistics alone do not tellthe whole story and are subject to misunderstanding.&quot;   Some proponents of the federal bill have questionedwhether requiring colleges to report crime statistics willhelp solve the problem. &quot;The bill goes a long way to startmaking people aware of crime on campuses. But it doesn'tspeak in any way to the root causes of the crimes,&quot; says JanMitchell Sherrill, director of the Campus Violence PreventionCenter. Mr. Sherrill said he would like to see collegesimplement crime prevention programs.   Indeed, the recent Gainesville tragedy demonstrates thelimitations of the Florida law requiring statistics to bereported. The state Legislature enacted a campus securityinformation bill in 1989. But under the law, the slayingswon't be included in crime statistic reports for theUniversity of Florida and Santa Fe Community College, wherethe victims were students, because the killings occurred inoff-campus apartments. (The proposed federal law requireseducational institutions to report crimes committed againststudents regardless of whether they occur on campus.)   Nonetheless, the Clerys and others believe that publishingthe statistics will force universities to beef up campussecurity. &quot;It won't reduce the number of criminally inclinedindividuals,&quot; says Frank Carrington, a Virginia Beach, Va.,lawyer specializing in representing crime victims, includingthe Clerys' organization. &quot;But if students know they shouldtake care of themselves, if they are forewarned to walk inpairs, then crime will decline.&quot;   Lehigh's Mr. Smeaton says that since Ms. Clery's murder,the school has increased its campus police force from 12 to15 officers. Residence halls are locked 24 hours a day andemergency telephones have been installed around campus, Mr.Smeaton says.   And as part of the settlement with the Clerys, alarms gooff in the campus police station if doors at Ms. Clery'sformer dorm are left open for longer than 20 seconds. Mr.Smeaton says the school plans to install similar systems inall the dorms.</TEXT></DOC>
