Low, vice president and general manager for technology products atIBM Corp., also testified against the tariff, as did representatives fromCompaq and Tandy.andP;  IBM reportedly has invested more than $100 million in ajoint venture with Toshiba Corp. to build active-matrix displays in Japan.andM;Even though the other two laptops Apple will introduce in the fall do not useactive-matrix technology, the stakes are high for the company.andP;  Industrysources said the company now pays about $475 for each active-matrix screen.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
