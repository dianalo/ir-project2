Parker issued a temporary restraining order preventingfurther erasures of PROFS tapes.andP;  a full Armstrong v.andP;  Reagan trial wasassigned to Judge Charles Richey; at press time it had not been granted acourt date.andM;Congress must determine which e-mail messages are to be treated as agencyrecords and which should be considered personal communications, the recordingof which would be equivalent to wiretapping a telephone conversation.andM;The OTA report raises more questions that it answers, yet one thing seemsclear: the current law no longer addresses the reality of governmentinformation as it exists today.andP;  The report suggests that Congress now has anopportunity to reconsider the purposes and goals of the FOIA.andP;  &quot;For the 1990sand beyond, Congress needs to decide whether the FOIA should continued to beviewed as an 'access to records' statute, or whether it should be perceivedmore broadly, as an 'access to information' statute,&quot; it states.andM;If Congress-which is currently reviewing the OTA's recommendations--adoptsthe latter interpretation, computer technology could open a new realm ofmeaning for the idea of open government.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
