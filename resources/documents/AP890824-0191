(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Only one Alabama city still clings to a citycommission form of government elected at-large, a system oncecommonplace but now mostly dismantled in what one scholar calls theSouth's ``Second Reconstruction.''   But change may come to the holdout, Muscle Shoals. A federaljudge is considering whether to order the creation of seven votingdistricts that could bring the first black into office in the city,which is about 10 percent black.   Similar rulings swept the state because of litigation prompted bythe 1965 Voting Rights Act. The major victim of the lawsuits was theat-large commission form of government, viewed as a bastion of whitepolitical power because blacks seeking representation from theirareas were outvoted by the white majority.   There still are some at-large-elected councils, but only one suchcity commission. County commissions and school boards did not escaperestructuring, either. Of the 67 county commissions, only a handfulare elected at-large, most in northern Alabama where there are fewerblacks. The pattern applies to the 67 county school boards and thethree city systems _ Huntsville, Jacksonville and Scottsboro _ thatelect their boards. The other 62 boards are appointed.   ``It amounts to a Second Reconstruction,'' said ChandlerDavidson, a political sociologist at Rice University, referring tothe Reconstruction Era after the Civil War. Davidson testified inmany federal hearings on lawsuits challenging the at-large method ofelecting city officials in many cities.   Davidson and other political scientists will meet Thursday inAtlanta to discuss the full impact of the Voting Rights Act on theSouth.   One of the most far-reaching lawsuits stemming from the act wasfiled in the late 1970s against Mobile, which Davidson ranked amongthe most segregated cities in the country in terms of jobs,education, housing and politics.   Bolden vs. City of Mobile paved the way for a 1982 amendment tothe Voting Rights Act eliminating the need to prove intentionaldiscrimination in efforts to change at-large election systems thatperpetuated white dominance. No longer could all-white governmentsdefend at-large election systems by saying simply that the intent ofthe system had nothing to do with racial discrimination.   Mobile changed from a city commission, elected citywide, to amayor and a council chosen from seven districts. Three blacks wereelected.   The 1982 amendment ended cities' resistance to racial change. Andit didn't go unnoticed that Mobile's legal bill was over $1 million.Soon, the financial burden and the increasing likelihood ofcourtroom defeat moved scores of local governments to change.   The commission form of government is ``history,'' said TuscaloosaCity Attorney Bob Ennis. ``You can no longer have a form ofgovernment that is not constantly aware of how cities operate on adaily basis.'' Tuscaloosa settled a voting rights lawsuit quicklysix years ago, switching to a mayor and council.   ``We're constantly aware of the Voting Rights Act every timethere's an annexation, redistricting or substantive change,'' Ennissaid.   There are 440 cities in the state, with an average of fivecouncil districts each. Some 410 council members are now blacks, andthere are 31 black mayors, said the Alabama Democratic Conference, ablack political caucus. There were 12 black mayors and 94 blackcouncil members in 1979.   However, changes in city hall don't necessarily reflect changedcities.   ``If you travel across the Black Belt now, what you will find,more often than not, is a courthouse controlled by blacks surroundedby white merchants who control everything else and they are hardlyspeaking, said Selma lawyer J.L. Chestnut, a veteran ofchange-of-government lawsuits.   ``So we have to take into consideration questions beyond the merepolitical consequences of an election arrangement,'' Chestnut said.   U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson is considering a lawsuit thatcould lead to change for a handful of cities that still haveat-large elections, including Muscle Shoals, which has never had ablack on its three-member city commission. The lawsuit began withsome 150 cities as defendants, but more than half have made changesthat satisfied the courts and black voters who filed it.   Some ``Black Belt'' cities in western Alabama were forced tochange through state legislation. Each has unique circumstances, andmost officials report political acceptance of choosing councilmembers from districts.   Brundidge, a mostly black city of 3,300, last year gave up itscommission in favor of a mayor-council system. ``You have more inputunder this system, a good racial and income mix,'' said Mayor JamesT. Ramage III, who is white.   Gadsden Mayor David Nolen believes that residents of his city of47,000, which is 25 percent black, would return to a citywide systemif given a choice. The mayor-council system adopted in 1986 becauseof a lawsuit has been typified by ``bickering'' between the mayorand council members, he said. There are two blacks on theseven-member council.   Some smaller cities remain unaffected, mainly because of theirlow percentage of blacks. In Arab, an all-white city of 6,600, CityAttorney Dave Beuoy said the mayor and five council members arestill elected at-large.   Such cities with few blacks, like Muscle Shoals, pose a delicateproblem.   ``Small municipalities are viewed by many whites as their lastsanctuary, and if we're going to have viable working relationshipsacross racial lines, we have to be careful how we go about thesethings,'' Chestnut said.   Birmingham voted out the city commission in 1962, though thecurrent nine-member city council, now majority black, remainselected citywide. However, a federal judge is weighing a proposal toswitch to election from districts _ six black and three white _after a group of whites filed a reverse-discrimination lawsuitclaiming the white vote was diluted by citywide elections.   Birmingham is waiting for a ruling from U.S. District JudgeRobert Propst before proceeding with October elections, said CityAttorney Jim Baker. ``This is the only case filed by whites I knowof.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PM, Mon Aug. 28</NOTE></DOC>
