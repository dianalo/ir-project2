Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. and Mobil Corp.announced the international financing agreements. They cannow proceed with the project, which is expected to cost $900million.</LP><TEXT>   The Oso field is owned 60% by Nigeria's state-owned oilcompany and 40% by Mobil Producing Nigeria, which is theoperator. The companies said production should begin in early1993.   Condensate is a very light and high-quality crude oil-likeliquid. It is the preferred feedstock for gasoline but isn'tincluded in the output quotas set by the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries. This is important for Nigeria,an OPEC member.   The Oso field was discovered in 1967. But little has beendone toward developing it except for seismic work and thedrilling of seven appraisal wells. Although a prime contractwas awarded last June, construction was held up whileinternational financing was sought.   The companies said the financing arrangements were signedwith the World Bank, International Finance Corp., the ExportImport Bank of the U.S., the Export Bank of Japan andcommercial banks including Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. TheWorld Bank loan is understood to be the bank's first for an&quot;upstream&quot; oil project in Nigeria.</TEXT></DOC>
