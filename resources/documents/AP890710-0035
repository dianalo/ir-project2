The outlawed National Teachers' Union said its members wouldresign en masse to protest the government crackdown on Sunday'sunion rallies.   About 12,000 riot police had sealed off downtown SungkyunkwanUniversity campus to block a rally of the union by teachers, familymembers and students.   Several thousand protesters regrouped in front of the NationalAssembly and several hundred more staged rallies in central Seoul,shouting anti-government slogans and clashing with police in sidestreets and alleys.   At least 20 teachers were injured in the protests, witnesses said.   Police said 1,931 people were arrested and 940 were released.Police said many of those jailed would not speak or give theirnames, delaying the release of others.   The government said names of teachers taking part in protestswould be sent to education authorities for discipline. About 130teachers have been disciplined or dismissed so far this year.   ``It is unreasonable for teachers to seek unionization,'' Rohsaid in a nationwide radio address today.   ``Should education become another arena for struggle, damage willbe inflicted on the next generation,'' Roh said. ``This will darkenour future.''   The National Teachers' Union claims membership of 20,000 and iscampaigning for better salaries and working conditions andelimination of bureaucracy, which the union claims hinders neededreform.   The government maintains the union violates the nationalemployees law that bans unionizing by government workers andteachers. Education authorities claim some teachers are using theunion to spread leftist and revolutionary ideas.   There are about 300,000 primary and secondary school teachers inSouth Korea. The average salary is about $550 dollars a month.   The formation May 28 of the teachers' union was among the latestattempts by workers to gain a larger slice of the economic pie asSouth Koreans throw off the yoke of authoritarian rule.</TEXT></DOC>
