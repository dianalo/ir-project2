Other changes found by the Congressional Budget Office, whichconducted the study of the nation's all-volunteer armed services,included an improvement in standard military test scores andeducational background of the current recruits.   ``These results, like those for race, represent a considerablechange from the beginning of the decade, when testing problems andrecruiting difficulties resulted in large numbers of low scorersand non-graduates being accepted for military service,'' said thestudy.   ``The Army achieved particularly impressive gains,'' said thereport, ``Social Representation in the U.S. Military.''   In 1980, less than 70 percent of active-duty recruits for thefour services _ Air Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps _ had highschool diplomas. Only 55 percent of Army recruits could lay claimto a secondary school degree.   But seven years later, 94 percent of active-duty recruits forthe four services had high school diplomas, as did about 91 percentof Army recruits.   About two-thirds of the recruits scored above average incomparison to the general youth population on the standard militaryentrance exams, the study said.   On the issue of minorities among the recruits, the study foundthat between 1980 and 1987, the percentage of blacks among recruitswith no prior military service fell by nearly 3 points _ 22.3percent to 19.7 percent. In comparison, there was an increase ofalmost 1 percentage point in enlistment-age youths who are black.   Contributing to the decline was the Army, where the share ofblack recruits fell by more than 6 percentage points.   The study also found that black recruits come disproportionatelyfrom sections of the country with above-average black incomes andbetter-educated black adults. In 1987, only 44 percent of the blackmale active-duty recruits came from areas in the bottom half of theincome distribution for black families.   Women accounted for less than 13 percent of active-duty recruitsin 1987, a slight drop from the 14.2 percent in 1980. The CBOattributed the somewhat steady total to the limited number ofmilitary jobs for women.   The CBO said the purpose of the study was to provide anobjective analysis and not reach any conclusions about currentpatterns of representation and ways to change them.   However, the study did say that instituting a draft would notchange the social composition of the military unless enlistedstrengths were significantly increased.   ``The all-volunteer force is doing a good job of attracting abroad cross-section of American youth,'' said Sen. John Glenn,D-Ohio, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee onmanpower and personnel and the lawmaker who requested the study.   The study, Glenn said, ``fills a major gap in our knowledgeabout who is attracted to the volunteer military.''</TEXT></DOC>
