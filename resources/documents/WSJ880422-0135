Industry officials said that petroleum prices could surge by $1 to $2 a barrel if convincing evidence of cooperation on shared production cuts emerges from the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers. But failure to commit to shared cuts could cause prices to plummet.    There is considerable skepticism in the industry, and within OPEC itself, that any lasting changes will result from the joint meeting, which is to be followed by a full OPEC conference on Thursday. &quot;The whole world is expecting 900,000 to one million barrels a day&quot; in output cuts, said Steven LaBonte, a Denver oil trader. &quot;If they don't do that, this market will fall on its face.&quot;    Mindful of the stakes, the five OPEC oil ministers who organized the meeting with the non-OPEC group have scheduled a strategy session of their own to be held Monday before the joint talks begin Tuesday. The ministers, who make up OPEC's price-monitoring committee, will be joined by a representative from Kuwait, which also has been in direct contact with non-OPEC producers regarding their suggestion of shared cuts to prop up oil prices.    Seven of the eight non-OPEC producers invited to Vienna for the meeting have confirmed their attendance, including Colombia, which previously had indicated it wouldn't participate, a senior OPEC official said. He said the non-member nations are sending top-level energy officials -- a majority of them oil ministers -- who should be able to approve on the spot any negotiated production cuts.    Adding to the importance of the meeting, industry officials said, is that the initiative for sharing output cuts came from Oman, Mexico, Egypt and others outside OPEC with a combined production of eight million barrels a day. Although not part of the original non-OPEC group, Norway and the Soviet Union also are expected to have observers present at the meeting.    But it is doubtful that OPEC will go as far as the non-OPEC members have suggested. Saudi Arabia's oil officials, reluctant even to hold a meeting to consider further reductions in OPEC's self-imposed output quotas, are pessimistic about the outcome, OPEC sources said.    It is clear that two of the heavyweights in next week's meetings, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, will argue that any production cuts by OPEC should be made by enforcing the quotas already in place. Moreover, this faction will insist on equal barrel-for-barrel, rather than percentage, reductions by the non-OPEC group.    OPEC currently produces nearly 18 million barrels a day. By strict enforcement of current quotas, it could reduce its oil flow by between 200,000 and 500,000 barrels daily. Figures differ, but the non-OPEC producers are said to be offering reductions totaling as much as 400,000 barrels a day if matched by larger cutback commitments from OPEC.    &quot;Though a number of OPEC members -- some of the (Persian) Gulf states in particular -- appear to be deeply opposed to any production cuts, the economics of such an exercise will not have escaped them,&quot; said a London oil analyst for Banque Paribas. &quot;Even a token cut, imperfectly applied, could have a substantial effect on market sentiment.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
