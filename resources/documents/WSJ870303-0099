But skeptics warn that this is a sure sign that the big returns are a thing of the past.    In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors buys a company and takes it private, using mostly borrowed funds to finance the transaction. Cash flow and often asset sales are used to pay down the debt. For investors, the appeal is the prospect of a big return when the restructured company is refinanced or sold in a few years.    The transactions being put together for individual investors are limited partnerships that comprise an equity stake, so-called mezzanine financing (privately placed junk bonds that usually include a small share in the equity), or a combination of the two. The partnerships generally project annual rates of return of about 30% on the equity stake and 20% on the mezzanine portion -- the minimums that those active in leveraged buyouts say are needed to make the risks worthwhile.    Such potential rates of return-based on the expected profit from selling the restructured company, divided by the number of years the partnership is likely to own it -- are possible because of leverage.    Consider a hypothetical company with a market value of $100 million that has $80 million of debt and $20 million of equity. A $10 million reduction of debt or increase in value through better profit margins or growth will raise the value of its equity 50% to $30 million. Thus, even modest financial improvements have a big impact on the value of the equity.    High returns are by no means certain, however. The company's future value hinges on economic developments that may be impossible to foresee. In addition, critics argue that leveraged buyouts mortgage a company's assets with no economic gain, and substantially increased balance-sheet risk, for the company.    The tax law eases the burden somewhat because interest on the debt is deductible. And if the buyout involves converting the company to a partnership from a corporation, there is no more corporate income tax to pay; profits are taxed only once, as the investors' personal income.    (An added plus for some investors is that gains from the partnerships currently qualify as so-called passive income that can be offset with passive tax-shelter losses under the new tax law. As the Treasury continues to refine the definition of passive income, however, there's a risk it will rule that the gains are fully taxable, ordinary investment income.)    But leverage works both ways. If a company involved in a buyout did do poorly, equity investors -- who have last claim on the company's resources -- could quickly be wiped out. In a recession, for example, a 10% reduction in the value of the hypothetical company would cut its equity in half.    Investors who provide the mezzanine financing would fare somewhat better. But even they could see the value of their investment vanish as the hard-pressed company struggled to pay off bankers and other senior creditors, who would have the first claim on its resources.    The first round of leveraged-buyout partnerships is being aimed at a rather limited group of investors, because most brokerage-firm sponsors prefer to test the waters with private transactions for their wealthier, more sophisticated customers. Only investors with net worths of $1 million or more and income of $200,000 can particpate in the private partnerships.    So far, just one public leveraged-buyout partnership has been offered: Equus Investments I, a diversified, &quot;blind-pool&quot; -- which means it isn't tied to predetermined transactions but is able to invest in those leveraged buyouts that come along. The offering, which required minimum investments of $5,000 ($2,000 for individual retirement accounts), closed more than a year ago after raising $36.7 million. Only now, however, is it completing its first leveraged buyouts. Equus Capital Management Corp., the Houston-based investment company behind the partnership, is currently offering a second one.    Integrated Resources Inc., a New York partnership sponsor, plans four or five private offerings this year totaling $200 million. It is currently arranging its first one, an $80 million partnership to participate in the $190 million buyout of Synthetic Industries Inc., a Chickamauga, Ga., manufacturer of polypropylene textiles. The minimum investment is $100,000.    Gabelli andamp; Co., a New York investment-management firm, closed a $31.2 million blind-pool private partnership last year. So far, however, the partnership, which was sold in units of $500,000, has had trouble finding suitable buyouts.    Oppenheimer andamp; Co. brought private investors into one of its leveraged-buyouts for the first time last year, and said the demand was overwhelming despite the $500,000 minimum stake. Meanwhile, Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. plans two private partnerships for very wealthy individuals and institutions, one to invest in buyouts and another to provide bridge financing.    Among the big retail brokers, Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., PaineWebber Inc. and E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. are all planning or considering leveraged-buyout partnerships aimed at individuals.    For the firms, the profit appeal of this type of product is clear. Fees can include a &quot;finder's fee&quot; of 1% to 3% of the cost of a leveraged buyout; a 12%-13% return on any financing the firm provides; a 2% management fee, and typically a 20% stake in any eventual capital gains. That's not counting the 8.5% commission the brokers get for selling the partnership units.    For investors, the partnerships are only as attractive as the underlying buyouts. Many in the field contend that the buyouts being put together these days are generally overpriced because of several factors. Among them: too much capital chasing too few good candidates, which has pushed costs up, and returns down, to what they see as unacceptable levels.    &quot;It may be a little late in the game to be attempting these deals, and what we're seeing may be a typical case of the public getting in just before the bloodbath,&quot; says David Hunter, head of direct investments at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., which is one retail firm that decided against offering a leveraged-buyout product to its investors.    Still, others insist opportunities exist for buyouts that offer attractive returns and acceptable risks. &quot;Endless divisions of big companies are being sold off, and there are tons and tons of private companies anxious to do these deals,&quot; says Stephen Treadway, a managing director at Smith Barney. &quot;It's a monstrous market and not at all picked over.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
