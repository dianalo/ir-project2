During thisperiod a number of changes have occurred in the well fluid chemistrythat have yielded insight into the character of the geothermal reservoirassociated with the East Rift Zone and have identified a number of potentialoperating problems, for future geothermal facilities that may be installedon this reservoir. These changes and their implications are discussed.2 references, 3 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
