 It also co-ordinates Canada's overseas telecommunications serviceswith those of other countries.andM;It participates in the activities of several international organizationsincluding Intelsat and Inmarsat, two consortia established byintergovernmental agreements that operate the space segments of internationalsatellite systems for general and maritime telecommunications.andM;The corporation was privatized in April 1987 and is now a subsidiary ofMontreal-based Memotec Data Inc.andM;CC: What do you see as some of the key developments over the decades?andM;Delorme: I would say that the first significant development in internationaltelecommunications occurred in 1956 when we put in service the coaxial cableacross the Atlantic which made it possible to carry telephone or voicetraffic on submarine cables.andP;  The capacity of those cables increasedgradually right up to the mid-'70s and early '80s because we inaugurated ourlast coaxial cable in the Pacific in 1983.andP;  The rate of growth in the past10, 15 years has been phenomenal.andM;The advent of digital technology for telephone has had one significant impactand that is at the level of the switching function.andP;  We have equipped ournetwork from the early '80s onwards with digital switches manufactured byNorthern Telecom, the DMS 300, and we were the first in the world to acquirethat technology for international purposes.andP;  It was very successful with theresult that now you see digital switches all over the place.andP;  This hasresulted in a much higher degree of efficiency and consequently in theability to reduce costs and prices.andM;The advent of the optical fibre cables has had the affect of providing theindustry with almost unlimited capacity.andP;  Satellite technology has evolved,the capacity of the satellites has also gone up tremendously.andP;  When they cameto being in the mid-'60s, most people were predicting that this was the endof the submarine cables.andP;  I think that the people at that time were welljustified in thinking that.andM;CC: What has this increased capacity meant in terms of the services you areable to offer?andM;Delorme: The telephone business is the major revenue earner, it's close to 75per cent of our revenues.andP;  On the other hand, most of the facsimile trafficis carried on the telephone network.andP;  So it is not possible to determinewhether the traffic we carry is pure voice or fax.andM;There are, however, streams like Hong Kong, Japan and the U.K., where thegrowth in the telephone traffic has increased in an unprecedented manner overthe last few years and we tend to ascribe a good part of that growth tofacsimile.andM;CC: How about data?andM;Delorme: We have a public switch data network which is going very well.andP;  ButI think at the international level, the data market is to a large degree onewhich is of interest to multinational corporations and therefore, in mostcases, those corporations will wish to have their own private network, whichwe also provide.andM;CC: There's a lot of talk about corporations forming global networks.andP;  Wouldthey do this on their own or rely on your help?andM;Delorme: I would think the latter.andP;  Let me preface the answer by a fewremarks.andM;One of the most significant characteristics of the market in the last fewyears is a higher demand for more and more specialized services.andP;  Not longago, carriers were providing fundamental traditional services like telephone,telex, and telegraph.andP;  It was more or less like Henry Ford manufacturingautomobiles, when he said that the public could have automobiles of any colorprovided that they were black.andP;  So there was practically no choice beyond thetraditional services other than very low-speed networks.andM;Because of the evolution of the technology, we can provide networks atfantastic speeds, either by submarine cables or satellites.andP;  I think thatthis is a very concrete manifestation of the globalization concept.andP;  I don'tthink that the globalization concept could effectively have materializedwithout the ability of the carriers to provide the electronic highway to makethe world of business effectively global.andM;CC: You need an infrastructure first?andM;Delorme: Exactly.andP;  Large users like the financial institutions -- themultinational companies -- have recognized the importance oftelecommunications and have therefore in most cases set up departments withexcessively qualified people who are more and more demanding.andP;  Therefore theinterface between the provider of services and the user of services is takingplace in a totally different context.andP;  We see Teleglobe to provide or tooffer what we call, in the jargon, the single-stop shopping, that is, anoffer of services to a large user whereby we would effectively undertake tomanage the network from beginning to end.andM;The telecommunications infrastructure is becoming an enabling infrastructurein the sense that it is highly possible to do business at the internationallevel.andP;  If the telecommunications infrastructure is not of good quality, doesnot have the required level of reliability, it hampers the efficiency andeffectiveness of the business customers and particularly their ability tocompete with the other players.andP;  So, for instance, if a network fails, canyou imagine what it does to the automatic teller machines network around theworld, what it does to the credit-card validation process or foreign exchangetrading.andM;CC: Is Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) relevant to Teleglobe?andM;Delorme: Very much relevant.andP;  As a matter of fact we believe that we willhave full capability to operate in an ISDN mode towards the end of thisdecade.andP;  We have already started in that respect, and in that, I could saythat we're very much evolving in parallel with other administrations,domestic and international.andM;CC: Is the Teleglobe network largely digital?andM;Delorme: Yes, it is.andP;  By 1995, it will be around 90 per cent digital.andO;Obviously, we have to interface with all countries of the world and there areseveral countries amongst the lesser developed countries which will continueto, in the next few years, operate in an analog mode.andP;  Therefore we will haveto retain, for some years to come, an ability to interface with the analognetworks of the other countries.andM;CC: Many would advocate more open competition in telecommunications, wouldyou?andM;Delorme: Well, first, I think I would wish to restrict my comments to theoverseas market.andP;  Secondly, I think that one should ask the fundamentalquestion: What is best -- taking public interest into consideration?andP;  I thinkthat the public interest requires reasonable prices, quality service,reliability and accessibility.andM;You must appreciate that Teleglobe Canada has only 10 per cent of the totalU.S.andP;  overseas traffic and yet it has comparable rates.andP;  Therefore, I thinkthis is a good example of productivity.andP;  Secondly, since privatization andregulation, which effectively started on Jan.andP;  1, 1988, Teleglobe has reducedits rates by an aggregate of 33 per cent.andP;  So therefore, if we assume thatpublic interest calls for reasonable rates, quality and reliability, I thinkTeleglobe has satisfied those criteria and I do not believe from that therewould be justification in de-monopolizing.andM;CC: Tell us about Vision 2000.andM;Delorme: Vision 2000 is a project which was initiated a couple of years agothrough joint action by the Department of Communications and the Canadian(telecom) industry.andP;  It has had two conferences which brought togetherscientists and engineers and marketing experts from all over the country --the last one being in November.andP;  At that point, it was concluded that theoverall objective of Vision 2000 was worth supporting -- to develop aconcerted Randamp;D strategy which would enable Canada to enhance itscompetitiveness in communications products and services over the medium tolong term.andM;Unless Canada develops a concerted strategy, bringing all the resourcestogether towards a common objective, it may not be in a position to maintainits competitive stance.andP;  Industry and government have pooled their resources,have agreed to fund the development over the next six to eight months, of abusiness plan.andP;  We would expect by the end of 1990, we would be able toproduce that business plan although it's too early to say what theconclusions of that plan will be.andM;The largest telecommunications manufacturers or service providers of Canadaare still small by comparison to the large multinationals we see in othercountries.andP;  I think it is by pulling our resources towards a concertedstrategy that we can achieve an acceptable level of competitiveness.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
