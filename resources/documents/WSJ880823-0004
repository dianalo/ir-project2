Nomani (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> CMD MIN PCS </IN><TEXT>   Most soybean futures prices plunged the permissible daily limit because of weekend rainfall, and forecasts for more rain are expected to damp prices through this week.    Sections of Iowa over the weekend received about an inch of much-needed rain, helping the soybean crop. Soil moisture should be further replenished this week as the jet stream, a pathway for storms, moves south from Canada to the Great Lakes region, according to National Weather Service forecasts.    As a result, heavy thunderstorms are expected this week over much of the Midwest Corn Belt. Normal to above-normal temperatures and precipitation are expected over the central eastern U.S., according to a National Weather Service forecast for this week. And, according to the agency's six-to-10-day forecast, released after the close of trading yesterday, near-normal temperatures and above-normal rainfall will continue next week.    At the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for November delivery fell 30 cents to $8.515 a bushel. Corn for September delivery dropped 10 cents to $2.7725 a bushel. Wheat futures prices also slipped.    Early Monday, before the futures markets opened, elevator operators dropped their cash bids for soybeans by 15 to 20 cents a bushel in reaction to the rains. Those cuts, called &quot;price protection&quot; in anticipation of sharp futures-price declines, prompted selling. Corn prices on the cash market fell three to five cents a bushel.    &quot;The rains prompted price protection, and we started to hear about it at 8 a.m. when we called around,&quot; said Dale Gustafson, an analyst in Chicago with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    Despite the expected thunderstorms, government meteorologists said the rain doesn't signal an end to the drought. In order for that to happen, drought-ridden states would need several months of steady rainfall to replenish soil moisture, forecasters said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices advanced, led by platinum, as the October futures-contract price spurted to $554.00 an ounce before settling back to close at $546.20 an ounce, up $11.50 from Friday's close. December gold contracts advanced $1.80 to $443.20 an ounce, and September-delivery silver rose 7.00 cents to $6.74 an ounce. While analysts noted that Japan had been a buyer of platinum bullion in Asia and Europe late last week, there didn't seem to be any developments yesterday to explain the rally. Vahid Fathi, analyst for Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben Inc., Cleveland, said that while the action might have been in reaction to the Japanese buying late last week, &quot;more likely, the action was mostly technical, exacerbated by a thin market.&quot; Another analyst noted, for example, that enroute to its intra-day peak, the October platinum-contract price touched off a flurry of pre-arranged buying orders at $545 and $550, both strategic resistance levels. In contrast, gold and silver rose only grudgingly later in the day, according to the latter analyst, who noted that recent demand for silver and for gold bullion has been quiet.    COPPER: Futures prices rose on continued strong demand. The contract for December delivery rose 2.70 cents to 98.25 cents a pound. At one point, the December contract advanced to 98.40 cents, establishing a new life-of-contract high. In fact, all delivery months, except nearby August and September, hit new life-of-contract highs during the session. Prices were weaker at the beginning of trading yesterday on the unexpected news that London Metal Exchange inventories rose last week. Yet traders shrugged off the development and pushed prices higher as the day progressed, with copper reaching its highs for the day in the final 15 minutes of trading, an analyst said. London Metal Exchange copper inventories rose 2,875 tons to 125,075 tons, a jolt to analysts who had expected a drop of 3,000 to 5,000 tons. One analyst emphasized that copper's move against the fundamental inventory news means that a strong technical market has developed in the metal.    SUGAR: Futures prices declined on further indications that there might be a bumper European sugar beet crop. The October contract price declined 0.10 cent to 10.13 cents a pound. According to analysts and dealers, tests on sugar beets in Europe are indicating an even larger sugar yield than was indicated by tests earlier this year. This caused selling in a relatively quiet and thin futures market, depressing prices, they said. The second tests so far this season on West German sugar beets showed a 15.4% sugar yield, up from 12.9% in tests about a month ago, and 13.7% in tests a year ago. Overall sugar yields for West Germany are also expected to be higher, at 6.26 tons per hectare (equal to 2.47 acres), compared with 4.20 tons per hectare in a test earlier this year and 4.18 tons in tests last year. </TEXT></DOC>
