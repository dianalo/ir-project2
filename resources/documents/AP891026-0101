The official did not comment on privately funded students. Thegovernment is expected to enact new regulations that will sharplylimit their numbers.   For all of 1989, 5,000 students are being sent abroad withcentral government funds, the official Xinhua News Agency quotedthe unidentified official of the Overseas Students Service Centeras saying.   It said this is the same number as were sent in each of the pasttwo years. In other recent statements, the government put thenumber being sent annual at 3,000. The discrepancy could notimmediately be resolved.   Xinhua noted the figure did not include students sent by localgovernments or work units. It also does not include students whofind private sponsors or win scholarships from overseas colleges.   ``Rational readjustment will be carried out this year in respectto the percentage of students sent to various countries and thecomposition of students,'' the official said.   ``Improvement is needed in the selection of students. Thetendency to stress foreign language only while neglectingcomprehensive quality should be put right.''   He did not elaborate, but education officials have said studentsshould show they are ideologically sound as well as academicallyqualified. The government also has said it will send fewer studentsfor long-term degree programs, and more short-term visitingscholars.   China is concerned that many students sent overseas have failedto return, and many of those who do return are filled with Westerneconomic and political ideas, such as democracy.   The impact of this new policy has yet to be felt because manystudents going abroad this year made arrangements well in advance.There have been individual cases of students or older scholars whoplanned to go overseas but have not been permitted to because ofsuspected involvement in the crushed spring democracy movement.   The State Education Commission has drafted new regulations thatwould sharply cut the number of overseas students by requiringcollege graduates to first work at least five years in China,according to sources in the commission and at universities.   The requirement would apply to students who find their ownfinancial sponsors or win scholarships from foreign schools. Theyare estimated to number several thousand each year.   The sources say the draft regulations are still being discussedbut likely will be approved next year.   More than half of China's approximately 80,000 students abroadare in the United States, and the rest are concentrated in Japan,Australia and Canada.   English is the second language studied by most college students.</TEXT></DOC>
