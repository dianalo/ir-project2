An estimated $2.7 billion would be allocated to themilitary component of the Energy Department's program in thefiscal year beginning Oct. 1, a 41% increase from currentspending. An additional $563.7 million would be provided forrelated domestic accounts, and the total of nearly $3.28billion for the cleanup represents an increase of $488million from the administration's budget request and morethan $1 billion from the current year.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We have to move faster,&quot; said Rep. Tom Bevill (D., Ala.),chairman of the subcommittee. &quot;This is a critical situationand I wanted to make sure we have the necessary resources toclean up this mess.&quot;   Within Congress, the cleanup of hazardous materials at theweapons plants commands strong bipartisan support. But as thefirst of the appropriations bills slated to come before theHouse, the high costs of the energy and water legislation aresure to draw opposition. The measure represents a netincrease of approximately $541 million above theadministration's budget for comparable accounts, and WhiteHouse Budget Director Richard Darman has sought to delay anyaction until an agreement is reached on a final spending planfor the new fiscal year.   The subcommittee action came as a closed-door meeting ofDemocratic leaders of the full Appropriations Committeeapproved tentative allocations for the 13 spending bills tofund the government in fiscal 1991. Discretionaryappropriations for foreign aid would be increased to anestimated $15.1 billion, in close conformity with thepresident's request. But elsewhere, Pentagon funding would becut deeply to offset increases in domestic spending. Themajor Pentagon bill would be held to $262.8 billion, comparedwith $287.1 billion under Mr. Bush's budget, while at thesame time, the two largest domestic appropriations billswould grow by more than $10 billion over the administration'srequest.   Discretionary funding for the Departments of Labor, Healthand Human Services, and Education would be set atapproximately $52.75 billion, for example, compared with$46.2 billion requested by the administration. Housing,environmental, veterans, and space programs would grow to$63.4 billion, compared with the $59.2 billion soughtinitially by the president.   Though the bill approved yesterday by the subcommitteefell within the guidelines of the House-passed budgetresolution, the legislation invites criticism by adding tensof millions of dollars for new research andwater-construction projects favored by influential members.In a step sure to provoke controversy, the subcommittee brokewith its practice in recent years and provided a total of $40million to $50 million in grants to five select universitiesfor science facilities backed by senior appropriators fromOhio, Alabama, Louisiana, Massachusetts and Indiana.   Mr. Bevill, for example, secured $10 million for abiomedical building at the University of Alabama, and Rep.Silvio Conte, the ranking Republican on the fullAppropriations Committee, added an undisclosed sum for BostonCollege.   Though the full details weren't available after theclosed-door meeting, Rep. John Myers, the ranking Republicanon the subcommittee, won funding for Indiana State, while theUniversity of New Orleans and Case Western University wouldbenefit from funding backed by Reps. Lindy Boggs (D., La.)and Louis Stokes (D., Ohio).   Within the Bureau of Reclamation, an estimated $30 millionis provided for the Garrison irrigation and water-diversionunit in North Dakota. Though controversial in theadministration's eyes, the sum was justified as a compromisebetween Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) and wildlife proponentsopposed to the immense project.   Elsewhere, Army Corps of Engineers construction fundingwould grow to $1.36 billion, a nearly 11% increase from thepresident's budget and including as many as 25 newconstruction starts.   For the White House, the Texas-based superconductingsupercollider is a major political priority, and the $318million represents the president's full request and a morethan 45% increase from what was appropriated for the currentyear. More than half the total, approximately $168.8 million,is expected to be allocated for early construction of theimmense atom smasher, and the remainder is divided $33million for capital equipment and $116 million for operationsand research and development.   The administration is pursuing foreign support to helpoffset the burgeoning costs of the project. But after makingcuts for this year, both the House and Senate AppropriationsCommittees appear prepared to proceed at least at the levelsought by the president.   Though the administration has so far resisted, House rulespermit the Appropriations Committee to proceed with its billsafter May 15, whether or not a formal budget has been adoptedby Congress. The Senate needs only a simple majority -- not60 votes -- to waive restrictions and follow suit, andwhatever the merits of the House-passed budget, it can beargued that it provides more discipline than no resolution atall.</TEXT></DOC>
