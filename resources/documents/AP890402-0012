South Africa accused the rebel South-West African People'sOrganization of infiltrating from neighboring Angola, but SWAPOsaid its guerrillas were defending themselves.   South Africa agreed to give up control of Namibia under aU.N.-monitored process that began Saturday.   Since late Friday, 120 guerrillas and six police officers hadebeen killed, territorial police Lt. Kierie du Rand said Sundaynight.   SWAPO president Sam Nujoma told a news conference in Harare,Zimbabwe, that group officials told him at least 48 civilians alsohad been killed in the confrontations, and many others had beenwounded. He said he could neither confirm nor deny the reports ofguerrilla deaths.   Namibian police said there were more than 30 confrontationsbetween officers and guerrillas during the day Sunday, and that thefighting continued into the night. No details about the clasheswere released.   U.N. officials, including Gen. Daniel Opande of Kenya, deputycommander of the peacekeeping troops, said the soldiers had neitherparticipated in nor seen the battles.   Territorial police said the fighting was in Owamboland,Namibia's northernmost tribal area, where the guerrillas have hadthe most support during their 23-year bush war against SouthAfrican control of Namibia.   The territorial army, due to be dismantled in mid-May as part ofa U.N. accord, suspended its demobilization process Sunday becauseof the fighting and began reassembling some units.   South African's foreign minister, Pik Botha, accused SWAPO ofordering hundreds of insurgents to cross into Namibia from Angolain violation of the U.N. agreement, reached in December.   On Saturday, Botha said his government might order the 1,000U.N. troops in Namibia to leave if it was not satisfied with a U.N.response to the fighting.   SWAPO accused South Africa of initiating the clashes and saidits guerrillas ``fired only in self-defense after being hunted downand attacked.''   ``It is the earnest desire of SWAPO to scrupulously observe theterms of the cease-fire agreement,'' SWAPO said in a statement fromits headquarters in Angola. It did not explain why its fighterswere inside Namibia.   Nujoma, in Zimbabawe for a conference on Namibia, said he was``dismayed and shocked'' that the United Nations would allow theterritorial police to be redeployed.   He told the semi-official Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agencythat the guerrillas were under strict instructions to abide by thecease-fire but that alleged violations were being investigated.   Until Friday, there had been no fighting between South Africaand SWAPO for more than six months as both sides observed aninformal truce.   SWAPO urged the United Nations to deploy more peacekeepingtroops to monitor the truce. A total of 4,650 U.N.-sponsored troopsare to be sent to Namibia during the transition to independence.   A spokesman for the U.N. force, Fred Eckhard, said SWAPO'sguerrillas were supposed to stay at least 100 miles inside Angolaas of midnight Friday. He said it was unclear whether the Namibianpolice, who remain in charge of law enforcement until independence,were entitled to operate against the guerrillas.   Botha, in a statement Sunday issued in Cape Town, South Africa,said some of the guerrillas were armed with surface-to-airmissiles, and that the U.N. Security Council should hold an urgentmeeting on the matter.   Four U.N. officials Sunday inspected the scene of the initialfighting and returned to Windhoek to report to the top U.N.official in the territory, Special Representative Martti Ahtisaariof Finland. They declined to comment on their findings, saying thesituation was too sensitive.   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellarissued a statement Saturday expressing alarm over the clashes. Hesaid U.N. officials in Namibia had confirmed an incursion by scoresof guerrillas.   South Africa's white-minority government has ruled Namibia sinceWorld War I. In December, South Africa agreed to the U.N.independence plan as part of a regional accord that also calls forwithdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.   Until independence, administration of the territory andresponsibility for law enforcement will remain in the hands of aSouth African-appointed official, Louis Pienaar, who is required tooversee the government and elections impartially.   Namibia is the size of France and West Germany combined, but ithas a population of only about 1.3 million, including roughly70,000 whites.   Iran on Sunday recognized Namibia's independence from SouthAfrica, and expressed hopes that the Namibian people wouldestablish a ``truly popular government,'' the official IslamicRepublic News Agency reported.</TEXT></DOC>
