Freedberg (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> ACTS </CO><TEXT>   Who's in charge here, anyway?    Melvin Klinghoffer claims he was effectively fired as president and chief executive officer of Action Staffing Inc. seven weeks ago, when the board put him on a 90-day leave and ordered him not to step foot in the company's office.    Not so, according to Action Staffing. The Tampa, Fla., temporary-help service says Mr. Klinghoffer is still the boss.    &quot;I know it sounds bizarre, but even as I sit here today, Mel is still the president of the corporation,&quot; says Lawrence Jones, executive vice president.    &quot;It is bizarre,&quot; says Michael P. Horan, attorney for Mr. Klinghoffer, who filed suit in state court in Hillsborough County to get the matter clarified. &quot;If Mel Klinghoffer is still the president, then why aren't they letting him act as president?&quot;    It all started July 27, when Action Staffing's board put the 41-year-old Mr. Klinghoffer on a 90-day leave, with pay and company car. Mr. Jones says the leave was a &quot;cooling-off period&quot; to smooth a &quot;little personal conflict&quot; between Mr. Klinghoffer and Chairman David Miller, whom the board put on a leave, too. The men were feuding over who was in charge -- each owns or controls about two million of the company's 16.2 million shares outstanding -- and they agreed to work on projects at home for a while, the company says. &quot;There was never any intention of firing Mel,&quot; Mr. Jones says.    In his lawsuit, however, Mr. Klinghoffer claims that was precisely the intention. He says the board effectively terminated his employment by denying him his powers as president and chief executive. He adds that the board &quot;without cause&quot; specifically ordered him not to go to the office.    The company says it &quot;vigorously contests&quot; that Mr. Klinghoffer has been fired and calls the claim &quot;totally without merit or justification.&quot; However, Robert Mullis, the company treasurer, says the board now will have to &quot;re-evaluate the whole situation&quot; -- and might end up firing Mr. Klinghoffer anyway because of all the trouble he's causing.    So who's in charge? Mr. Mullis and Mr. Jones say they are running things for now. Mr. Miller, the chairman, says he plans to go back to work next month. Mr. Klinghoffer's attorney says he isn't sure what his client will do, but he at least wants the court to decide his rights under an &quot;ambiguous&quot; employment agreement. Mr. Klinghoffer is concerned that a provision of the agreement may bar him from working for any competitor until April 1, 1993. </TEXT></DOC>
