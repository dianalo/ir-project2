Recognitionand ultimate surgical management of the many abnormalities found in thisgroup require precise preoperative delineation of the morbid anatomy.Conventional axial tomography provided the first accurate picture ofthe sagittal dimension, but it was limited by poor contrast resolution.Computerized tomography and ultrasound have finally provided the meansfor accurate measurement of midsagittal diameter and surface area. Itis now possible to provide a preoperative assessment of bony and soft-tissuecanal compression and to guide surgical decompression by objective anatomicmeasurements. True spinal stenosis of the lumbar vertebral canal is aform of compression produced by the walls of the vertebral canal. Itinvolves the whole of the vertebral canal by exerting compression attwo of its opposite surfaces. There are two types of stenosis: (1) transportstenosis, wherein the clinical manifestations are due to impeded flowof fluid, which is dependent on the available cross-sectional area ofthe canal surface of the stenotic structure, and (2) compressive stenosis,which includes abnormal compression of opposing surfaces only. Accordingto these definitions, indentation on the spinal canal by disc protrusionor localized tumor is not considered true spinal stenoses. In this chapterthe authors discuss only those conditions that produce true canal stenosis.</TEXT></DOC>
