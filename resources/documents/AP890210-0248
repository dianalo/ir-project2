But othercitizens, from drug addicts seeking treatment to couples adoptingchildren, may find hope in the president's 1990 budget blueprint.   For veterans, the president asked Congress in a nationallybroadcast address Thursday night to retain a 1 percent originationfee on V.A. housing loans, but dropped former President Reagan'sproposed boost in the mortgage fee to 3.8 percent.   Bush's proposal to extend the 3 percent federal excise tax onlocal and long-distance phone calls will come as only the smallestof surprises to those who read Bush's lips during the 1988presidential campaign. Bush pledged ``no new taxes,'' but didn't sayanything about expiring ones.   Like Reagan, the president offered a bitter pill to federalretirees, including military pensioners: a 1990 pension freeze thatwould save taxpayers $1.4 billion.   Bush also would ban federal retirees from collecting a portion oftheir benefits in a lump-sum that now averages nearly $30,000.   In 1991 and beyond, Bush would limit the retirees' raises to thecost-of-living minus 1 percentage point. Reagan, himself now afederal pensioner, also sought those cuts.   But the nation's 38 million Social Security beneficiaries, duefor roughly a 3.6 percent increase in January 1990, would not beasked to sacrifice.   ``Social Security is fully funded, including a fullcost-of-living adjustment. We must honor our contract,'' Bush said.   To keep campaign promises, Bush asked for a $149 million increasein the $1.2 billion Head Start budget to enroll up to 95,000 more4-year-olds in the pre-school readiness program _ a one-thirdincrease in that age group. But advocates say more than 2 millionpoor pre-kindergarten children are eligible for Head Start, andcurrently there are places for only 453,000.   Working poor families with infants and toddlers would benefitfrom another budget plank lifted intact from the Bush campaign: anew tax credit of up to $1,000 per child under age 4.   This credit would be refundable to families that don't pay incometaxes, and would be phased out for families with incomes between$8,000 and $13,000 in 1990.   Bush also wants to tinker with the tax code to spur adoptions.``I propose to re-enact the tax deduction for adoption expenses, andto double it to $3,000,'' he said.   He would pump more than a quarter-billion dollars extra into thewar on drugs, already slated for a sizable increase in the finalReagan budget. All told, the Bush administration sought $5.5 billionto wage the fight against drugs, $974 million, or 21 percent morethan in the current budget.   Among the increases: $127 million, or 24 percent, more for drugtreatment, including a $25 million grant to reduce the waiting timefor admission to treatment programs.   Victims of crime might be helped by Bush's request to increase afederal compensation fund to $125 million from $94 million.   He proposed a variety of incentives for America's students andteachers, including the first $30 million toward an eventual $500million ``Presidential Merit Schools'' program and new awards of$5,000 apiece to 1,200 teachers.   Top high school seniors in science and math could compete for 570college scholarships worth up to $10,000 a year.   Americans also might learn more about themselves and theireconomy under Bush's blueprint. He wants to more than double to $1.6billion the budget for gathering economic and demographic statistics.   While Bush shelved a Reagan plan to cut more than $1 billion fromMedicaid payments to states, he still hopes to pare Medicare'sbudget by $5 billion.   Bush said his Medicaid budget would expand coverage to pregnantwomen and infants up to 185 percent of the poverty line, and poorchildren up to age 8. He also wants to allow poor families to getimmunizations for children under 6 simply by showing a food stampcard at clinics.   For the homeless, Bush proposed full-funding of the McKinney Act,which would boost spending from $500 million to $644 million, and hewants to launch a new $50 million initiative to help move homelessfamilies out of welfare hotels and improve services for the mentallyill.   And every young American would be challenged to perform voluntaryservice under the aegis of Bush's proposed ``YES to AmericaFoundation'' The government would provide matching grants of $25million a year for four years.</TEXT></DOC>
