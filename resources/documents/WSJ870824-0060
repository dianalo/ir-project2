But the clone makers say the effort so far is little more than a heavy-handed intimidation tactic that won't work.    Outside the courtroom, IBM is issuing strong warnings that rivals won't be able to build a legal clone of its newest PCs unless they get patent licenses from IBM -- a requirement that could present a new barrier to entering the clone market. Big Blue already has filed two unusually broad lawsuits against alleged infringers of the trademark for its four-month-old PC line, called the Personal System/2. One suit filed a few weeks ago claims an accessory called &quot;Rampage/2&quot; violates IBM's trademark because it uses the suffix &quot;/2.&quot;    The new campaign marks a sharp difference from Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM's approach to cloners of its first generation of PCs. IBM's first PCs were mostly put together with off-the-shelf parts. The company didn't push hard for patent protection, and it raised less-sweeping copyright challenges only to the most blatant copycats. In contrast, IBM is said to have applied for dozens of patents on its new line.    Some in the industry, including IBM's rivals, say the campaign won't thwart less expensive, compatible alternatives to the PS/2 that are now in design and haven't yet hit the market. The industry sources criticize IBM for making threatening noises about patents it hasn't yet disclosed -- or even been awarded. They say the patent applications cover PS/2 parts whose usefulness isn't yet clear.    &quot;(IBM's) behavior is certainly different -- they are posturing ferociously,&quot; says Lance Hansche, vice chairman of Phoenix Technologies Ltd., whose software lets clone makers mimic IBM machines. &quot;Before, they didn't have a period of fear and loathing when they could run around claiming that they somehow built something that had an intellectual property value.&quot;    If the critics are wrong, IBM may indeed be able to reclaim market share from the clones by playing legal hardball over proprietary technology inside the PS/2. At the very least, IBM's stance could threaten dozens of tiny clone makers that can ill afford new and expensive legal hurdles.    Few goals are as important for IBM these days. Its share of the market for personal computers that follow its standard -- that is, machines made by IBM and the clones -- will fall to 38% this year from 53% in 1985 and 40% last year, predicts market researcher InfoCorp. Such a drop, in IBM's most visible consumer market, would stand as one of IBM's most rankling public-image setbacks.    In its first family of PCs, IBM specifically used widely available parts and an &quot;open&quot; design that would let independent companies make software, accessories and even full computers that compete with the IBM line. It decided that was the only way IBM's PCs could become an industrywide standard and displace Apple Computer Inc., the creator of the personal-computer market.    But that strategy worked too well: The clones grabbed a startlingly large part of the personal computer market. The chorus that IBM had let sing backup started elbowing its way to center stage.    IBM's strategy is sharply different this time around. &quot;We have learned from our PC experience that the way you protect your investment isn't by using off-the-shelf products, but by developing and designing from the ground up,&quot; says Henry Hall, the IBM manager who oversees the company's patent licensing. &quot;And by doing that, we have been able to build into our system a variety of forms of intellectual-property protection that we hope will serve us much better.&quot;    IBM has been delivering its tough new message in recent months at industry gatherings and in private sessions with other companies. &quot;To hope to make a clone, the least they would require would be a license for our utility patents,&quot; says IBM's Mr. Hall.    Statements like these outrage many clone makers, because they argue IBM is being intentionally vague about just what its new secret technology is -- and how IBM will protect it. Patent applications normally take at least a year to be approved, and are kept secret until then. IBM also says it has secrets in the PS/2 that are protected in other ways besides patents -- yet it refuses to describe them.    &quot;One of the things that's really frustrating the industry is you can't get a grip on what it is they've got that they'd sue over,&quot; says Graham Beachum, senior vice president at Dell Computer Corp., an Austin, Texas-based company that sells clones under the PC's Limited brand.    To rivals, IBM's reluctance to detail its new technology, coupled with its eagerness to warn that others will have a hard time legally matching it, is an effort to stir doubts about clones and thereby prod customers into buying Big Blue. High-technology marketers speak of the FUD factor, or &quot;Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt.&quot; Says Dell's Mr. Beachum, &quot;If you take it from any other perception but IBM's, its really nothing else but pure FUD.&quot;    At the center of the controversy over IBM's PS/2 technology is what IBM calls the &quot;Micro Channel,&quot; the newly designed pathway that moves data back and forth from the guts of the computer to its accessories, such as the screen and the data-storing disk drive.    The PS/2 will eventually have several new features -- including a higher-resolution screen and more powerful internal software -- but many in the computer industry agree that the Micro Channel will be the hardest to reproduce legally.    It still isn't clear how important the Micro Channel really is. But some IBM rivals contend the device is aimed at making their own clone efforts tougher rather than giving customers better performance. &quot;We've done (tests) and really failed to see any performance benefits,&quot; says Steven Holtzman, marketing director at Wyse Technology, one of many clone makers that have been frantically taking apart the first PS/2 models and poring over their innards -- especially the Micro Channel. &quot;Is there a real benefit to it? That's very unclear.&quot;    IBM, meanwhile, has fanned the flame of interest in the Micro Channel by publicly stating that it is willing to license Micro Channel patents, under certain circumstances. To some rivals, those statements seem designed to send a message that PS/2 clone makers will face lawsuits from IBM if they don't license those patents.    &quot;Maybe you don't know whether you infringe any patents -- you're just buying this to make sure you're not sued by IBM,&quot; says Ronald Laurie, a San Francisco lawyer representing Chips andamp; Technologies Inc. in negotiations with IBM for PS/2 patent licenses. &quot;You might even look at it as an insurance policy,&quot; he says.    Chips andamp; Technologies, based in Milpitas, Calif., makes widely used microchip sets for clone makers, designed to imitate the inner workings of IBM's old PC line. It is working on similar products for the PS/2.    Further clouding the question of the Micro Channel's true role is the fact that the IBM models that fully use it won't be out until late this year. The internal software that will tap all its power won't be out until 1988. Hence, some clone makers brand the Micro Channel as another part of IBM's supposed &quot;FUD&quot; strategy.    Of course, IBM will silence all its cynical rivals if it turns out that the PS/2 does offer proprietary features that customers embrace, and that clone makers can't duplicate without an IBM license. In particular, the Micro Channel could let data move along PC networks much faster, something corporate customers badly want.    IBM scoffs at suggestions that it is playing marketing games with the PS/2's technology. &quot;We don't invest in technology just to thwart the clones,&quot; says Linda Dezan, an IBM spokeswoman. &quot;The investment in technology is to deliver an outstanding product to meet customer requirements. That's the reason for development of technology like the Micro Channel.&quot;    IBM filed its two trademark lawsuits in federal courts in California against makers of boards designed to add extra memory to the PS/2: AST Research Inc. and Orchid Technology Inc. IBM charged that AST violated the PS/2's trademark by naming two of its products &quot;Rampage/2&quot; and &quot;Advantage/2,&quot; and by taking out ads with the headline, &quot;PS/2 Memory. Our Name Says It All.&quot; It alleges trademark violation in an Orchid ad with the headline, &quot;Introducing PS/2 Memory Expansion for People Who Think Big.&quot;    Both suits ask for unspecified damages and injunctions against the defendants. The two defendants said they were in talks with IBM about the charges.    IBM is famous for coming down hard on perceived intellectual property violations, but these two suits struck some in the industry as rougher than usual. &quot;When you are extremely wealthy, you can get to buy numbers, and IBM now owns the number 2,&quot; joked Dell's Mr. Beachum.    &quot;If IBM's going to go after the use of the name, how much more so will they go after someone who clones their proprietary internal technology?&quot; asked Tim Bajarin, an industry analyst at Creative Strategies International. &quot;It's a signal saying that if you try and clone the stuff, we're gonna be there.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
