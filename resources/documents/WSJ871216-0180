Only a few decades after storm-trooper boots proclaimed the victory of fist over mind in the country that likes to call itself &quot;the land of poets and thinkers,&quot; dangerous demonstrations against nuclear missiles, nuclear energy or almost any modern facility -- even the Frankfurt airport's new airstrip -- have become the rule. Now, at last, the West German government seems ready to do something about it.    For months the liberal Free Democrats, junior member in the governing coalition, had blocked an anti-riot measure proposed by their senior partner, the Christian Democratic Union. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU wanted a &quot;Vermummungsverbot,&quot; a law that made it a crime to march in a demonstration wearing any kind of mask, from motorcycle helmet to a scarf around the face. But it was only after a couple of murders at a supposedly peaceful demonstration at the Frankfurt airstrip that the Free Democrats came around and backed their partner.    The step is long overdue. Bloody brawls of demonstrations are commonplace in today's Germany. It isn't unusual to learn of a &quot;black block&quot; of masked marchers attacking police with clubs, steel pellets and Molotov cocktails. Against these advances the police were helpless, because nonmasked sympathizers milled protectively around their masked colleagues. The evidence for a mask ban is strong. Police experts say their research shows that the anonymity of masks has a seductive quality that makes people prone to commit mass violence.    But the Free Democrats balked. Their justification, they argued, was the protection of 19th-century-style liberal values. In their eyes the &quot;Vermummungsverbot&quot; would become an illiberal symbol, like the no-longer-practiced &quot;Berufsverbot,&quot; which kept communists out of posts as teachers or civil servants. At its party conference in September, the party voted against a &quot;Vermummungsverbot.&quot; There is a conflict here, and the party acknowledged it. But while admitting that &quot;liberalism&quot; as a cause actually should involve open-faced presentation of arguments, rather than masked mass action, the party nevertheless decided that forbidding masks would lead to an illiberal, general restriction of the right to demonstrate.    Violence brought the truth home to these fancy rhetoricians. On Nov. 2 two policemen were shot dead -- and nine more badly wounded -- when they tried to dissolve a group of masked demonstrators at the Frankfurt airport. Suddenly even the liberal FDP leadership started to remember Germany's dark past, when street marches were instrumental in overthrowing democracy. A member of the party's left wing, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, compared the violent demonstrators of today with Hitler's storm troopers in the Weimar Republic. She also pointed out that much could have been done to nip the totalitarian danger in the bud if the government in those days had enforced laws restricting violence.    This shift is important because it reveals that a significant lesson is being learned by the heretofore naive FDP. Until the airstrip murders, liberal politicians considered it uncouth to compare the marchers of Weimar days with today's &quot;peaceful demonstrators.&quot; This posture has to do with their tolerance of the Greens, which always have been in the forefront of violent demonstrations and their justification. The party was backed up in its position by the German press, whose darling the Greens are.    The violence is having an effect on the Green Party as well. While most of the attention was on the Free Democrats over the weekend, the Greens also held a party conference. The meeting was prompted by the party's &quot;moderate&quot; leader, Otto Schily, who demanded in a paper that the party forswear violence of any kind and accept the state as the sole body in Germany allowed to use force.    The party's left-wingers opposed him: Former communist Thomas Ebermann and other radicals argued that the Greens' business goes beyond ecology. They said the party's task is to overthrow &quot;the system,&quot; a term also used in Weimar days by the Nazis, and, then as now, connoting liberal democracy. Mr. Ebermann flatly stated that the Greens should, when &quot;organizing resistance,&quot; adapt themselves to the situation &quot;at the given place.&quot; Translation: If there is fighting, go along with it.    Given the nationwide reaction of horror at the deaths in Frankfurt, this position is a pretty risky one to take. But the Greens apparently feel they have nothing to fear from causing fear. Mr. Ebermann won a huge majority on the violence dispute. The Greens put off further discussion till a new congress next spring. But the party's fundamentalist wing -- known as the &quot;Fundis&quot; -- has proclaimed itself the radical majority and prophesied dire consequences for less fiery party members. The Fundis even suggested that the tamer members either shut up or get out.    To those who have closely followed the Greens since their inception, this new party face will come as no surprise. Actually the Greens have had a radical side ever since Marxists such as Mr. Ebermann came to the fore. Indeed, this left-wing visage has been part of their charm: Some of them say that decent behavior from a party that vies for votes just like the rest would have meant losing a profile. This is particularly so now that all German politicians, not just the Greens, are proclaiming themselves environmentalists. The Greens' appeal to gilded youth in a rich country lies in their readiness to flip out, to demand unreasonable things in an unreasonable way. Thus Mr. Ebermann may have found a good short-term recipe for political survival.    In the long term, though, the hope is that the &quot;Vermummungsverbot&quot; will curb him and his ilk. German police have not so much been hampered by a lack of laws as by a lack of political backing for action. In the city-state of Hamburg, the government of Social Democrats and Free Democrats pacified squatters in condemned buildings by voting them millions to &quot;rent&quot; the buildings they occupy. But the same squatters have for years stolen what they needed to live in those places. They have terrorized the surrounding neighborhood, and sometimes even the city government itself, by marching around in &quot;black blocks,&quot; smashing shop windows and burning automobiles.    The lawlessness has reached the point where citizens are asking why they should pay parking tickets while squatters are allowed to get away with everything. In the Ruhr region, laborers have taken the rowdies' lead and, in protests against the closing of unprofitable steelworks, have set up roadblocks and forced their way into board rooms.    The Kohl government can pat itself on the back for organizing the &quot;Vermummungsverbot.&quot; But the sad truth is it will need more than a technical bit of regulation if it wishes to save the second German republic from the ways that were the death of its Weimar predecessor.    ---   Mr. von Loewenstern is editorial-page editor of the Germany daily Die Welt. </TEXT></DOC>
