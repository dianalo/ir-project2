AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. troops today surrounded theNicaraguan and Cuban embassies after rumors spread that Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega may have fled there during the U.S. militaryinvasion that toppled his regime.   The Nicaraguan government immediately ordered its army tosurround the U.S. Embassy in Managua until the siege on its embassyended.   U.S. troops hunting for Noriega gained control of all majorPanamanian military bases after sporadic fighting late Wednesdayand early today.   On Wednesday night, Noriega tried to rally his supporters bymaking a brief radio address in which he vowed to ``win or die.''   The general's loyalists apparently still held at least a dozenAmericans hostage. Armed thugs roamed through the capital today,one day after the U.S. attack on Panama in which at least 18Americans died.   After rumors spread that Noriega or other members of thePanamanian Defense Forces high command were in the Nicaraguan andCuban embassies, U.S. troops in armored personnel carrierssurrounded the two missions.   One armored personnel carrier driver had to ask a reporter fordirections, and a soldier laying concertina wire at the NicaraguanEmbassy said, ``We're just securing exits.''   The Nicaragua government, which has fought the U.S.-supportedContra rebels for eight years, ordered its troops to surround theU.S. Embassy in Managua until U.S. troops withdrew from theperimeter of its embassy in Panama City.   Several hours later, State Department spokesman Richard Bouchersaid that ``tanks or armored vehicles'' were surrounding the U.S.Embassy in Managua. ``There is some sort of activity like thatgoing on,'' he said in Washington.   Heavy fighting raged in the middle-class suburb of San Miguelitojust before dawn, marked by machine-gun fire, grenade explosionsand light artillery fire. U.S. aircraft and helicopters flewoverhead and drew ground fire.   By daybreak today, the fighting had ceased, and U.S. Army troopspatrolled the streets as many Panamanians began looting shops oncemore. There was no evidence U.S. troops were trying to halt thelooting.   U.S. military officials said most of the fighting betweenpro-Noriega forces and American troops has subsided and that littlereal threat remains.   Col. Ronald Sconyers, spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command,told a pool of Pentagon reporters Wednesday that much of thegunfire still being heard around the country is from roving bandsof Noriega's civilian ``Dignity Battalions'' who were ``justgetting their last licks in.''   Meanwhile, the Panama Canal opened today after closingWednesday, the first time anything other than a landslide hasforced the 75-year-old canal to close. The 43-mile-long waterwaywill be open only during daytime until at least the weekend, thePanama Canal Commission said in a statement from Washington.   Shortly before midnight Wednesday, a day of terror ended for 29Americans and other foreigners at the Marriott hotel when about 90paratroopers from the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division secured thebuilding after firefight.   Armed Panamanians had raided the hotel periodically and abductedguests, eventually freeing all but two, the hotel's manager and aCBS news producer.   The hotel was cleared of guests today, and there were reportsthat U.S. soldiers were exchanging gunfire with Noriega loyalists,a Marriott spokesman in Washington said.   In addition, the Smithsonian Institution said 11 scientists andtechnicians were missing from a research institute and believedtaken hostage.   Pentagon officials said finding American hostages is a ``primaryconcern.''   Noriega surfaced with an ominous message. He said on agovernment-run FM radio station that he will now lead a guerrillawar against the United States.   ``We're in trench warfare now and we will maintain theresistance,'' he said. ``We ask the world for help, with men,dignity and strength. Our slogan is to win or die, not one stepback.''   The general's whereabouts could not be determined, and it wasunclear whether he had substantial forces under his command.Journalists recognized the voice on the radio Wednesday night asNoriega's.   In Washington, Pentagon officials said troops may have to headinto the jungle to pursue Noriega units.   The United States was offering a $1 million reward for Noriegaand $150 for each firearm surrendered.   American forces appealed today in radio broadcasts for membersof Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces to surrender.   ``Do not fight for a small group of drug traffickers. Rememberthe oath you took when you joined such an honorable institution asthe Defense Forces,'' one broadcast said in Spanish. ``Your fellowcitizens are asking your help to restore democracy.''   Pentagon officials said about 1,500 U.S.-based reinforcementswere flown into the country late Wednesday to assist an exhaustedattack force and prepare to flush Noriega loyalists out of PanamaCity.   That effectively doubled to 24,000 the number of U.S. troopsthat had been in the country before President Bush ordered``Operation Just Cause'' in a bid to topple the general who hasbeen a thorn in the side of two U.S. presidents.   Bush initially ordered 9,500 troops to Panama to augment 13,000at bases along the Panama Canal.   The Bush administration declared the operation a militarysuccess. At least 18 Americans were dead, 117 wounded and onemissing. Also, one American female dependent was killed.   Noriega's president, Francisco Rodriguez, said more than 60Panamanians had been killed and hundreds were wounded, many of themcivilians.   By late Wednesday, U.S. troops controlled most Panamanian basesand the government television station. They had also knocked out aradio tower, silencing the national network that had broadcastappeals for resistance and military messages.   Bush said in a speech Wednesday morning that he ordered theinvasion to bring Noriega to trial in the United States on 1988cocaine-trafficking charges, to protect the 35,000 Americans inPanama and to restore democracy.   Opposition leader Guillermo Endara, winner of the May 7elections that were voided by the Noriega-controlled government,was sworn in as president. Also sworn in were First Vice PresidentRicardo Arias Calderon and Second Vice President Guillermo``Billy'' Ford.   None surfaced by late Wednesday, however, and a call for publicdemonstrations of support drew no visible reaction.   Noriega declared Friday that Panama was in a ``state of war''with Washington and a U.S. Marine lieutenant was killed the nextday in what American officials called an unprovoked shooting.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III claimed the administrationhad received unconfirmed reportes that Noriega planned to order anattack on an American residential neighborhood in Panama.   U.S. forces began the attack by pounding Panamanian militarybases in and around the capital with mortar, cannon and machine-gunfire. Noriega's headquarters in the densely populated neighborhoodof Chorillo was gutted.   U.S. troops took 150 Panamanians prisoner and were holding themin an automobile storage lot, a report from Pentagon pool reporterssaid.   The U.S. invasion was the biggest chapter in Washington's longwar with Noriega, a career soldier who had a strong core of supportamong working-class people and who seemed to delight in defying themighty United States.   Noriega survived two coup attempts from within his DefenseForces and Washington's best non-military efforts to oust him,including harsh economic sanctions that severely depressed theeconomy.   Bush ordered the sanctions lifted Wednesday and said he intendedto turn over the Panama Canal as required under existing treaties.</TEXT></DOC>
