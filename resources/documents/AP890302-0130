Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib's intention to dispatch the 500 soldiersFriday represented a policy shift by the military, which has keptout of Israel's battle with Palestinian and Moslem guerrillas insouth Lebanon, where Israel occupies a strip of land just north ofits frontier.   ``Israel is much stronger than we are. We don't have the weaponsIsrael has; we don't have their technology and their army outnumbersus. ... But we should confront Israel,'' he said in an interviewWednesday at his home in Moslem west Beirut.   Khatib commands about 22,000 soldiers based in Moslem territorysouth of Beirut and along the coast, and Gen. Michel Aoun has 20,000Christian troopers in Christian territory north and east of thecapital.   The army divided when Moslem militias drove Christian units fromwest Beirut in February 1984, nine years into Lebanon's sectariancivil war. Aoun technically commanded the entire army, however,until a dispute over the presidential succession created twogovernments last fall.   Khatib, 55, did not say whether his troops would initiate actionagainst the Israelis, but indicated they would have a greater partin defensive operations when the Israelis and their predominantlyChristian surrogate militia penetrated beyond the border ``securityzone.''   Although army units have been caught in crossfire several times,the Lebanese military has not fought a major engagement with Israelfor more than 16 years.   ``We have our strong belief in our homeland,'' Khatib said. ``Wehave our dignity and we should honor our belonging to the Arabnation. ... We should confront Israel.   ``This doesn't mean that we have to commit suicide, but we can'tbe indifferent toward Israel. We'll fight and try to hamper theenemy's advance as much as we can.''   He declared, with a shake of his fist for emphasis: ``This is ourdestiny as we see it.''   Khatib said he was moving the reinforcement battalion to southLebanon to support the approximately 3,000 soldiers deployed in thearea.   ``I expect an Israeli operation at any time,'' said the general,a former inteligence officer who trained in the United States in1967. ``The Lebanese army can only regain its confidence and justifyits existence by confronting our traditional enemy, Israel.''   Lebanon's military split became complete when President AminGemayel's six-year term ended with no successor elected becauseright-wing Christians opposed candidates chosen by Syria, thecountry's main power broker.   Christian and Moslem governments emerged from the crisis, withthe Christian cabinet led by Aoun, a Maronite Catholic chosen byGemayel as caretaker prime minister when his term expired.   Moslems refused to accept Aoun's authority and acting PrimeMinister Salim Hoss, a Sunni who heads the Moslem cabinet, appointedKhatib commander of Moslem army units.   By longstanding agreement, Lebanon's president is Christian, theprime minister Sunni Moslem and the Parliament speaker Shiite.   Syria, which has 40,000 soldiers stationed in Lebanon, supportsKhatib's command.   In the interview, Khatib said his troops would coordinate withthe U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, the peacekeepers sent to southLebanon to implement Security Council Resolution 425.   The resolution was passed after Israeli forces withdrew fromLebanon in 1978 after an invasion intended to crush Palestinianguerrillas. It calls for unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forcesand deployment of the 5,800 peacekeepers along the border.   The U.N. forces, whose operational area overlaps the Israelibuffer zone, have not been able to patrol the border because Israelrefuses to pull back.   Israel invaded again in June 1982 and established the ``securityzone,'' which ranges in depth from six to 10 miles, when its armywithdrew three years later.   Moslem army units are based in the southern coastal towns ofSidon, Zahrani and Tyre. Their closest positions to the Israelis arearound Zaghdraya, about 12 miles north of the zone.   The Lebanese army did not resist the invasions. Its last majorclash with Israel was in September 1972, when it faced tank columnschasing Palestinian guerrillas in south Lebanon. Thirteen Lebanesesoldiers were killed.</TEXT></DOC>
