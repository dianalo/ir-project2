An official of the increasingly flakySmithsonian, which would run the national biodiversitycenter, says &quot;It is asserted that one can pick up a handfulof soil anywhere in this country and the majority of theorganisms will not be known.&quot; No one's against new knowledge,but we hope this doesn't mean that viruses are to becomeprotected species until conclusively proved to be enemies ofHomo sapiens. Or could it mean that modern microbe huntersmight face the prospect, unlike the discoverers ofpenicillin, of having to file environmental-impact statementsbefore developing drugs to kill microorganisms that arefederally protected until proven guilty?</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
