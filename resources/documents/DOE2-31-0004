This series has a reputation for providinghigh quality, carefully edited, comprehensive reviews of establishedtopics in the field of molten salt chemistry. Volume 6 of this seriescontinues this reputation. This book is divided into four chapters coveringdiverse and important topics such as ionic mobilities in molten salts,industrial processes for the production of aluminum and magnesium frommolten salts, and organic and organometallic reactions in molten media.Contributors to this volume include A. Klemm of the Max-Planck-Institutefor Chemistry, J. Thonstadt of the Norwegian Institute of Technology,G. J. Kipouros and D.R. Sadoway of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,and R. M.
