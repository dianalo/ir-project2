To the great dismay of the oil industry, Congress voted torequire the sale of an advanced, cleaner-burning&quot;reformulated&quot; gasoline in the nation's nine smoggiest areas.But nobody, including the industry, knows for sure what thisreformulated gasoline really is. A fuel capable of complyingwith standards by the mid-1990s in proposed clean airlegislation hasn't been invented yet.</LP><TEXT>   Moreover, there still is a dispute over whether to relyonly on reformulated gasoline to help clean up the air.Non-gasoline fuels such as methanol and compressed naturalgas could play a role. The Senate bill doesn't contain aproduction mandate, so the issue will have to be decided in aHouse-Senate conference committee.   The oil industry had pushed to head off new federalrequirements and alternative fuels by pressing development ofreformulated gasolines that it already has begun selling. ButCongress came up with its own formula for gasoline because&quot;frankly, we don't trust them,&quot; says Rep. Bill Richardson, aNew Mexico Democrat.   The Senate stunned big oil several weeks ago by voting inan amendment to the clean-air legislation that defines aspecific type of less-polluting gasoline to fuel autos in thenation's nine smoggiest areas, which comprise 25% of thetotal U.S. gasoline market. These cities are Los Angeles, NewYork, Houston, Baltimore, Chicago, Milwaukee, Philadelphia,San Diego and much of Connecticut. The formula in the Senatebill would require oil companies to boost gasoline's oxygencontent through the use of additives such as ethanol.   The House approved a similar amendment as part of itsversion of the clean-air bill. But while the House measurealso contains a recipe for gasoline, it gives the oilcompanies greater flexibility to ignore the formula if theycan produce a fuel that yields environmental benefits thatare greater than those of the recipe fuel.   &quot;The industry keeps screaming about reformulated gasoline,but when you try to take them at their word they seem not tobe very serious,&quot; says Rep. Richardson, who sponsored theHouse amendment. The amendments specifying a formula &quot;are away to ensure they do comply.&quot;   The oil companies already have labeled as many as sevennewly developed gasolines as reformulated, angering somelawmakers and even some industry officials who say thesecompanies -- Arco, Diamond Shamrock, Conoco, Phillips,Marathon, Shell and Exxon -- are grabbing for a piece of amarket that doesn't even exist yet.   &quot;It's a real stretch to call these fuels reformulatedgasoline,&quot; says Tom Cachette, deputy executive officer ofCalifornia Air Resources Board.   All of the new &quot;reformulated&quot; gasolines reduce the fuel'svolatility, or tendency to evaporate, which is required insome markets anyway. Some eliminate a portion of the morepolluting components in favor of less noxious additives. Butmost are available on a very limited basis and only incertain locations.   Some companies, such as Shell and Exxon, &quot;have doneprecious little,&quot; says Dan McKay, editor of Octane Week, atrade publication tracking this issue. The two oil giantshave added a splash of methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE,but haven't cut down on aromatics or olefins, two majoroffending gasoline components currently under scrutiny byCongress. &quot;A lot of companies blend MTBE into their gasolinesand don't pound themselves on the chest,&quot; Mr. McKay says.&quot;Exxon and Shell are trying to see how little they can do andstill call their gasolines reformulated.&quot;   Oil company executives had expected more stringent airquality standards to be imposed, but had assumed they wouldbe able to define the fuels to be used themselves. ButLawrence Goldstein, executive director of the PetroleumIndustry Research Foundation and an industry partisan,concedes: &quot;They may have moved a little too fast and hurtthemselves politically. Congress may now feel compelled todefine the game for the industry.&quot;   Representatives of the oil and auto industries claim thatthey are testing at least 25 blends of gasolines to see ifthey can come up with the formula that will clean upunhealthy emissions that currently pollute the air. But theearliest they'll know is late summer, says Joseph Colucci, aGeneral Motors Corp. executive acting as co-chairman of thestudy.   Currently there are hundreds of gasolines on the market.All have similar properties but, like fingers on a hand, eachhas its own specific print, dictated by what kind of crudeoil they were made from and at what refinery they weremanufactured. Gasoline sold under the same brand name by thesame oil company may have differing amounts of aromatics orolefins but be close enough in other properties to be sold asthe same product.   Industry experts concede that it is possible to make aone-formula gasoline. But refineries would have to take onthe work of petrochemical plants, breaking down each fuelcomponent into separate molecules and then reassembling themaccording to the predetermined recipe. It's a much morecomplicated process than currently practiced and, by theindustry's reckoning, might mothball one-third of thenation's refineries. &quot;Under that criteria, gasoline couldcost consumers $5 a gallon,&quot; says Tom Austin, an industryconsultant and former EPA official.   Congressional staff members contend the House language onreformulated gasoline would raise the price of gasoline by upto five cents a gallon.</TEXT></DOC>
