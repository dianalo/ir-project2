<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-56-0726 </DOCNO><TEXT>Digital subtraction angiography is a diagnostic method whereby for theprocessing of the angiographic image the technique of a subtraction maskand computation is used, which at the same time renders possible dynamicrecords (real time) of all angiographic stages. The record is storedin the memory of a computer and from there it can be projected any timeon the monitor and analyzed. The method offers new opportunities in thediagnosis of haemangiomas and vascular malformations of the orofacialregion. It also helps in decision taking on whether a surgical approachor intra-arterial artificial embolization should be adopted. The authorsgive an account of two patients in whom they used the new diagnostictechnique and of their own experience. (author). 9 figs., 6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
