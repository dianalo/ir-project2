The civil penalties were the largest assessed in a single case by the department's Mine Safety and Health Administration under a 1977 law. They were levied against Utah Power andamp; Light Co., Salt Lake City, the mine owner, and Emery Mining Corp., Provo, which operated the mine.    Both companies are contesting the agency's charges and the penalties, the agency said, and a hearing will be held. The agency issued 34 citations in March.    The agency levied $77,000 in fines for alleged violations of federal mine-safety regulations. It said the alleged violations contributed to the fire and the deaths of the miners and management personnel who were trapped in the underground mine.    The alleged violations cited by the agency included failure to properly train miners in the use of self-rescue equipment, failure to adequately maintain certain control and safety-shutdown switches, and failure to properly separate intake-air and conveyor-belt escapeways, thereby letting the belt escapeway quickly fill with smoke and gases.    Fines totaling another $34,470 were assessed for other alleged violations that the agency said didn't contribute to the fire.    In Utah, an Emery spokesman said the company likely will challenge the proposed fines. Emery said it also has notified the Labor Department that it concurs with Utah Power that Emery, and not Utah Power, should be liable for any sanctions or fines imposed by federal agencies.    &quot;It's our interpretation that under current law, it is traditionally the operator, not the owner, who is cited,&quot; a Utah Power spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
