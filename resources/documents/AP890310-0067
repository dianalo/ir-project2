Prodded by increasing scientific evidence thatchlorofluorocarbons are destroying the ozone shield protecting Earthfrom cancer-causing ultraviolet rays, the West has promised to banor significantly reduce their use by the end of the century.   Third World countries do not dispute the facts and figures, butthey are just embarking on large-scale expansion of refrigeration,air conditioning, plastics and electronics industries, most of whichdepend on chlorofluorocarbons.   Australia's science minister, speaking an an internationalconference in London this week, wondered aloud if it is fair to askfor equal measures in both kinds of countries.   ``This raises a major moral problem in the West,'' said theminister, Barry Jones.   The dispute recalls the 1960s debate over the insecticide DDT.The West discovered it was harmful to both plants and animals andimposed bans or restrictions in 1970-71 against the wishes ofdeveloping nations, which feared a resurgence of disease-carryinginsects.   Another environmental issue dividing the West from the ThirdWorld is the dumping of toxic waste.   President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya told the London conferencethat recent dumpings in Africa of toxic chemicals from industrialcountries were ``unfriendly actions ... equivalent to declaring waron the Earth's ecosystem.''   On the ozone issue, developing countries demand Western help infinancing any switch from chlorofluorocarbons to safe substitutes.   The chemicals, developed in the United States more than 50 yearsago as the working fluid for refrigerators, also are used inaerosols, fast-food packaging and computer solvents. About 1.2million tons are produced annually, more than 76 percent in theUnited States and European Economic Community.   When chlorofluorocarbons reach the stratosphere 15-25 miles up,as much as 100 years after emission, they break apart and theirchlorine atoms deplete the ozone. Chlorofluorocarbons also trapheat, increasing Earth's temperature in a process known as thegreenhouse effect.   Washington now says it will ban all chlorofluorocarbons by 1999if safe substitutes become available. The 12-nation EEC has agreedto a similar timetable but its environment commissioner, Carlo Ripadi Meana, wants an earlier target.   Thirty-one countries have ratified the 1987 Montreal Protocolrequiring the amount of chlorofluorocarbons to be cut in half by1999.   Another 20 countries have agreed to sign up, but China, India andBrazil, with rapidly growing populations, are not among them. Theyhave urged Western nations to create a fund to help them acquiretechnology to replace chlorofluorocarbons, but insist the money notbe deducted from existing aid.   ``Any reduction in these resources for whatever reasons wouldmean that the poor of these countries will have to wait longer forthe promised freedom from hunger and poverty,'' said Z.R. Ansari,India's environment minister. ``The poor are no more prepared towait, and there will be social upheaval if they are asked to waitany longer.''   China's environment commissioner, Liu Ming Pu, told the Londonconference his nation of 1.1 billion people uses less than 2 percentof the world's chlorofluorocarbons.   Western nations say the potential for chlorofluorocarbons use inthe developing world is enormous and could wipe out any cuts made byindustrial countries.</TEXT></DOC>
