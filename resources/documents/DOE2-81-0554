There maywell be others about which we are still ignorant. The dust, and especially,the dark soot absorb ordinary visible light from the sun, heating theatmosphere and cooling the Earth's surface. All four of these effectshave been treated in the authors; recent study, known form the initialsof its authors as TTAPS. For the first time it is demonstrated that severeand prolonged low temperatures, the &quot;nuclear winter&quot;, would follow anuclear war. The new results have been subjected to detailed scrutiny,and many corroboratory calculations have not been made, including atleast two in the Soviet Union. Unlike many previous studies, the effectsdo not seem to be restricted to northern midlatitudes, where the nuclearexchange would mainly take place. There is now substantial evidence thatthe heating by sunlight of atmospheric dust and soot over northern midlatitudetargets would profoundly change the global circulation. In our studies,several dozen different scenarios where chosen, covering a wide rangeof possible wars, and the range of uncertainty in each key parameterwas considered (e.g., to describe how many fine particles are injectedinto the atmosphere).</TEXT></DOC>
