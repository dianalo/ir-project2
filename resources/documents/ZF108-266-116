(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Support for a Complex NetworkandM;Providing adequate support for a vast network is difficult at best.andP;  But whenthe network must span voice, data and multiple software and hardwareplatforms, the need for specialized support seems to leap in exponentialproportion to the number of technologies the organization requires.andM;Supporting a vast network is a challenge the University of California, SanDiego (UCSD) has been meeting over the past several years.andP;  UCSD currentlyemploys a 125-mile broadband Ethernet backbone to facilitate voice and datainterchange among 200 buildings over a 12-mile expanse.andP;  The back bone servesas a window to resources including a 1,000-node local area network (LAN),multiple IBM and VAX minicomputers and mainframes and a Cray supercomputer.andM;Like many large organizations that must support a broad spectrum of ISservices, UCSD is continually evolving and expanding its network environment.andO;As a result, the campus has been a popular beta site for LAN products.andO;Beyond accommodating new technological elements, which in itself is complex,the university must establish training and support resources to reflect eachchange.andM;At UCSD, Steve Relyea, vice chancellor of business affairs, is directlyresponsible for the campus network.andP;  Relyea manages 15 administrativedepartments including accounting, purchasing, personnel and thetelecommunications group, which handles the majority of the physicalmaintenance of both the campus' PBX installation and backbone network.andP;  Thebackbone is partially fiber, and the network uses some excess microwavebandwidth that was available from the PBX installation.andM;The PBX system and the broadband backbone were already in operation whenRelyea joined UCSD in 1986.andP;  Relyea designed a network for the administrativeconstituency with the assistance of consulting firm Intergrated Analysis, ofSan Diego, which is now part of New York City-based LANSystems Inc., asystems integrator.andP;  This network includes 45 local area networks andprovides administrative users with access to virtually every system on thecampus, including the supercomputer and ARPANET, through an e-mail conduit.andM;Early on, Relyea realized that such a comprehensive network would require agreat deal of support for both the network administrators and the users ineach of its computing environments.andP;  However, Relyea faced severalchallenges:andM;* Diverse technologies.andP;  The campus must maintain and support multiplehardware systems.andP;  It also has a varied stock of software that includes UNIX,and mainframe- and PC DOS-based applications, both networked and stand-alone.andO;The campus requires training programs to address the principal applicationswithin each operating environment.andM;* Multiple sources of support.andP;  Current sources of network support includethe telecommunications department, LAN system administrators for eachdepartment and LANSystems Inc.andP;  Relyea must correlate these channels ofsupport to prevent overalp and to ensure that the system is meeting all ofthe universityhs needs.andM;* Dependence on nontechnical service providers.andP;  As with many largeorganizations, particularly in the academic arena, UCSD has very few staffmembers who are specifically trained in data communications.andM;* Limited telecommunications staff.andP;  Although the department is growing, thetelecommunications group currently includes eight specialists (three forsoftware, five for hardware) to support a user community of more than 1,000people--a ratio of just one technician for every 125 users on the network.andM;Relyea is the first to admit that keeping support programs up to speed withthe network's growth is virtually impossible.andP;  But, aided by reliance ondepartmental administrators, the university has been managing with trainingprograms available through the personnel department and a blend of internaland external resources.andM;UCSD uses several methods to meet its support challenge:andM;1.andP;  Product Selection--Preventive MaintenanceandM;To ensure that existing support resources are not overtaxed, UCSD carefullyselects standards hardware and software products, thus minimizing trainingand support requirements.andM;On the software side, Novell Inc.'s NetWare network operating system standardprovides the same interface to all netwowrk users.andP;  Predominant softwarestandards include Lotus 1-2-3, WordPerfect and Paradox, although some dBASEIII and IV applications also exist.andM;Before the network was installed two years ago, the university had somescattered stand-alone microcomputers and some micros with IRMA boards thatwere connected to mainframes.andP;  Currently, UCSD is running NetWare 286 and isin the process of converting to the 386 version.andP;  &quot;The NetWare environment isbasically invisible to our nontechnical users,&quot; Relyea says.andP;  &quot;The networkusers continue to work in the same way with the same applications as before.&quot;andO;Many department administrators have elected to use a menu shell to promoteease of use.andM;The departmental networks all use PS/2 Model 80 servers.andP;  Where possible,each server uses an identical configuration, and all use the same version ofNetWare.andP;  All network workstations are PS/2 Model 50s or Model 70s.andM;&quot;I remember thinking, wow, you could go a lot cheaper than that.andP;  But from amaintenance standpoint, the PS/2 have been great,&quot; says Toni Phillips,systems administrator for UCSD's personnel department.andP;  &quot;PS/2s are inherentlyeasy to maintain.andP;  And since we have a standard workstation, if I have aproblem with one, i can simply swap another one in and send the [first one]out for repairs.&quot;andM;2.andP;  The Systems AdministratorandM;The first line of training and support at UCSD is the systems administratorin each department.andP;  The systems administrators are responsible for addingand removing nodes, estalishing user accounts and maintaining the physicalcomponents of their local Ethernet cabling.andM;In larger departments, such as personnel, the university has hired full-timetechnical specialists to act as LAN administrators.andP;  In some of the smallerdepartments, LAN administrators are simply technical oriented users whomanage their local networks as one of their job tasks.andM;The UCSD personnel department has developed in-house training courses on thevarious applications and on networking.andP;  This service is not free of change.andO;Individual department using the training programs pay for the courses throughinternal cost transfers.andM;Despite the emphasis on standard hardware and software, UCSD allowsdepartment administrators to make choices regarding training facilities andtools useful with LANS, such as memory management schemes and menus.andP;  Thedepartments are free to provide their own training classes, to take advantageof courses sponsored by personnel or to use external training resources.andM;3.andP;  TelecommunicationsandM;UCSD's telecommunications group is responsible for the physical health of thebroadband backbone, which carries signals for both data and voice.andP;  BobGreen, data communication manager for the telecommunications group at UCSD,sees a growing trend toward combining telecommunications and datacommunications support.andM;The university's four microwave bridges, for example, were initiallyestablished to support the campus PBX.andP;  By tapping into the extra microwavebandwidth for data transmission, however, UCSD was able to gain thesecapabilities at a minimal cost and with minimum requirements for additionalsupport.andM;The disadvantage of centralizing voice and data systems support, at least atpresent, is that it tends to put people who were not specifically schooled indata communications at the helm of the organization's programs for networktraining and support.andM;In UCSD's case, the telecommunications staff is sufficiently technical, butthe group is small.andP;  Besides supporting the physical network, thedepartment's eight specialists also operate a help desk and provide expertisefor network training courses, which are managed by personnel.andM;&quot;We didn't set out to establish a formal help desk, but that's essentiallywhat we've ended up with,&quot; says Grenn.andP;  &quot;With our limited staff, we stressthe use of LAN administrators as the first rung of support.andP;  Then, if there'sstill a problem, it's typically the network administrator who gives us acall.&quot;andM;4.andP;  External SupportandM;The role of the systems integrator, beyond design and implementation, is toprovide UCSD with a backup source of support for any area of the network.andO;LANSystems' assistance is particularly important for areas involvingmultivendor environments and when the telecommunications staff is stretchedtoo thin, such as when it is bringing an entire department on line.andM;Interoperability among products is an area where UCSD relies heavily on thesystems integrator.andP;  &quot;When you're using a lot of kinds of equipment, you needto have some mechanism for ensuring the operation of the entire system,&quot; saysLeo Spiegel, executive vice president of sales and marketing for LANSystems.andO;&quot;The systems integrator needs to be the ambassador--to work with the vendor[and] to ensure the pieces fit together.&quot;andM;When UCSD was planning to lilnk PC u sers into other systems, for instance,it had a choice between installing either many more IRMA boards or NetWareSNA gateways.andP;  The latter choice would have saved tens of thousands ofdollars on hardware; however, only the prerelease version of the NetWaregateway was available at the time.andP;  In order to make the LAN gateway solutionwork, the systems integrator worked directly with Novell's programmers to getweekly updates of the code.andM;A systems integrator can also be useful in cases where the user needscapabilities that don't exist.andP;  UCSD needed a connection between itsUngermann-Bass Inc. backbone network and the Novell NetWare it had installed.andO;With the help of LANSystems, the university was able to persuadeUngermann-Bass to develop a new driver, and the problem was solved.andM;5.andP;  User Group SupportandM;As an end-user community grows, an important training tool can be the usersthemselves.andP;  UCSDhs personnel department, which administers training courses,has worked to formalize the grapevine of support through the PLUS (PersonnelLAN User Support) user group.andP;  The group holds weekly meetings to addressnetwork topics.andP;  Between meetings, users share ideas and new information viae-mail.andM;Relyea notes, with pleasure, that some of the best networking tips have comefrom this relatively nontechnical group of users.andP;  For example, as personnelstaff struggle to support the first-of-the-year onslaught of questions aboutW-2 forms, one of the LAN users in the payroll department developed a set of1-2-3 macros to assist the staff in responding.andP;  With that program, which isnow on the network, the payroll department can ask the relevant questions,enter the answers on line, and have the program calculate the appropriteresponse.andM;The university's cc:Mail e-mail system is popular among the users.andP;  Relyeacredits the e-mail channel for fostering much of the current synergy,although he points out &quot;all we've done with cc:Mail is install the packageand make the users aware that it's there.andP;  They've been picking it up anddeveloping ways to use it on their own.&quot;andM;The Business Affairs office, for example, has eliminated &quot;While you were out&quot;phone messages.andP;  Instead, employees use the &quot;Subject&quot; entry in cc:Mail toenter the name and phone number of the caller.andP;  Now, those in a hurry canglance at a summary report listing names and phone numbers of callers,instead of reading all of their telephone messages.andM;Another function users initiated is e-mail conferencing.andP;  Once user, forexample, may submit a proposal via e-mail to a specified group.andP;  The group'sresponse to an individual's proposal might include their reactions, commentsand responses to the issue, all of which are color-coded to identify eachauthor.andP;  &quot;Before the e-mail, getting the groups together involved a lot ofscheduling hassles,&quot; says Relyea.andP;  &quot;Now, within a matter of hours, it's clearwhere everyone stands.&quot;andM;In the future, Relyea expects to enhance much of the network backbone withfiber optics technology (some of the fiber segments, in fact, are already inplace).andP;  The fiver optics cable is expected to increase reliability.andM;Although the campus is already accessing mainframe applications through theLAN, Relyea is contemplating the possibility of establishing peer-to-peercommunications between the LAN and the IBM mainframes if and when PortableNetWare is available for mainframes.andP;  Upon the availability of PortableNetWare, UCSD is planning to use it with its Hewlett-Packard systems.andP;  Theuniversity is also developing an integrated financial application which willinvolve both mainframes and LANs.andM;Training TroublesandM;Although the new programs will add functionality to the existing network,they will also increase the university's requirement for training andsupport.andP;  &quot;Even now, we're not able to provide comprehensive training on eachof our systems to all of our audiences--we have so many technologies, it justisn't feasible,&quot; Relyea says.andM;With assistance from the telecommunications group, UCSD will continue toprovide internal training and support programs for the primarly products UCSDusers require.andP;  The university will also continue to encourage innovativesupport programs from the users.andM;UCSD is likely to rely still more heavily on third-party training and supportproviders in the future.andP;  &quot;Some of the NetWare training courses, especiallyfor administrators, are best provided by an outside course--one of thosethree-day intensive kind of things, rather than the three-hour courses wetend to provide,&quot; says Relyea.andM;Although it has limited staff available for training network users, UCSDtries to provide those users with a variety of options.andP;  &quot;We try to provideour users with good alternatives, both inside and outside of the university.andO;We supply information about the programs, and then we let them decide.&quot;andM;Cheryl Snapp is a freelance writer specializing in communications for Snapp andamp;Associates, based in Orem, Utah.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
