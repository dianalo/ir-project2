As previously reported, Thompson Co., which is controlled by the family that founded Southland, offered to buy the convenience store retailer in a two-step cash and stock transaction valued at about $4 billion, or $77 a share. The Thompsons currently have a tender offer outstanding to buy 31.5 million common shares, or about two-thirds of the common stock outstanding, for $77 a share and to buy all 2.5 million preferred shares for $90.27 each.    The acquisition now is contingent on at least 31.5 million common shares being tendered. Thompson said that if less than half the preferred shares are tendered, the preferred stock will remain outstanding after the acquisition.    In addition, Thompson said it may buy as much as 2% more common shares, or about 980,000 shares, under the tender offer if fewer than 1.3 million preferred shares are tendered. If it does buy additional common shares, it said, the remaining common holders will receive less cash and more stock for their holdings.    Currently, Thompson plans to pay the remaining shareholders $61.32 in cash and 0.6272 of a new $25 exchangeable junior preferred stock for each common share they own. Altogether, the company said, it will offer $72 cash and $5 preferred stock for each Southland share.    Southland officials weren't available to comment on why the offer was amended.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing the changes, Thompson said the three brothers who control Southland plan to contribute 2.6 million of their Southland shares to the capital of the acquired company. About 210,000 shares will be sold in the open market or through private transactions before the purchase. The remaining 1.8 million of their Southland shares will be held until the merger, the document said. </TEXT></DOC>
