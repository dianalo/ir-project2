The Bush administration is anxious to defuse the conflict beforeit aggravates other political strains between America and the12-nation European Community. European officials have expressed adesire as well to settle the dispute, which has resulted in a totalban on shipments of U.S. beef to Europe.   Frans Andriessen, the top trade negotiator for the EuropeanCommunity, told reporters today that he hoped a compromise solutioncould be reached.   ``It is always fluid as long as it is not frozen,'' Andriessensaid in explaining both sides' negotiating positions before thetalks resumed today.   The discussions had begun with a working dinner last night hostedby Ambassador Roy Denman, the European Community's representative tothe United States.   New U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and AgricultureSecretary Clayton Yeutter, who had served as America's top tradenegotiator during the Reagan administration, were leading the U.S.negotiating team.   Also taking part in the discussions today was Ray MacSharry,formerly Ireland's finance minister and now the European Community'scommissioner in charge of agriculture.   American beef has been banned in Europe since Jan. 1 because of aprohibition which took effect then against hormone-treated meat.   The Reagan administration retaliated immediately with tradesanctions imposed on $100 million worth of European food products,ranging from canned tomatoes to instant coffee and boneless beef.   The 100 percent U.S. tariffs, totaling $100 million, roughlyequaled the estimated sales of American meat products that were lostunder the European ban.   Officials are seeking to defuse the dispute before newcounter-retaliation measures are taken by the Europeans, who havethreatened to approve on Monday 100 percent duties against $100million of American exports of walnuts and dried fruit.   Bush, referring to the dispute in his first address to Congress,said last week that the major industrial countries needed ``to riseabove fighting about beef hormones to building a better future, tomove from protectionism to progress.''   The U.S. position has been that the hormones, which are fed tocattle to increase their bulk, do not pose any health threats. Butapparently the new administration is willing to reach an accord withthe Europeans so that the dispute does not escalate into a biggerbattle with one of America's biggest trading partners.   The United States is pushing for establishment of a scientificpanel under international trade rules in the hopes of showing thathormone-treated American meat is safe.   In return, U.S. officials may go along with a certificationprogram that would allow hormone-free American beef to be sold inEurope. Such a proposal has been advanced by Texas AgricultureCommissioner Jim Hightower.   The Texas plan would involve isolating untreated cattle frombirth through slaughter, giving them tests for artificial hormonesand establishing enforcement procedures. Texas officials say thatsimilar programs meeting European standards have been proposed byBrazil and New Zealand.</TEXT></DOC>
