At a news conference Friday, the 46-year-old Gonzalez, appearingconfident and relaxed, said the unions could not determine hisSocialist Party's policies.   Responding to rumors of his early resignation, Gonzalez said:``In politics, to comment about these things does nothing more thancontribute to an increase in rumors.''   He said conflict with the unions would not affect Spain's currentsix-month presidency of the European Economic Community.   ``This work will not be affected by a greater or lesser amount ofsocial conflict,'' he said.   Gonzalez also pledged that his 6-year-old government would make``a maximum effort to keep on track'' Spain's annual 5 percenteconomic growth rate, the highest in Europe.   The prime minister's comments came three days after the collapseof six weeks of talks between the government and unions overunemployment and pension benefits. The collapse set off fears oflabor strife expected to last through the spring.   ``Some political leaders have called either for my resignation ornew elections,'' Gonzalez said.   ``I'd like to tell the Communist leaders who propose this thatperhaps I'd like to consider it, but not for the reasons that they,logically, want.''   Gonzalez was referring to a call for his resignation Wednesday byleaders of a small leftist parliamentary coalition. The coalitionbelieves that elections now would favor them because the Socialistshave lost voter support.   Elections must be held by June 1990.   A poll published last week in the newsweekly Cambio 16 indicatedthe Socialists would receive 35 percent of the vote if electionswere called now, a drop from the 44 percent they won in June 1986elections.   The Socialists hold 183 of the 350 seats in the lower house ofParliament.   Last December the General Workers Union, a former Socialist Partyally, and the Communist Workers Commissions staged a general strikethat brought Spain to a standstill for 24 hours.   After a nearly seven-hour negotiation session Tuesday, the unionsrejected a government offer of $3.3 billion to broaden unemploymentinsurance, increase basic pensions and raise the minimum wage. Theymaintained their demand for increased benefits totaling $3.6 billion.   The prime minister said the collapse of the talks ``is not just afailure for the government, but also a failure for the unions.''   He said maintaining Spain's high economic growth rate wasfundamental to reducing the country's 18.8 percent unemployment,Europe's highest.   ``In governing, sometimes it's preferable to put at risk one'sloss of popularity than to assume the risk of not taking advantageof the opportunities'' for economic growth, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
