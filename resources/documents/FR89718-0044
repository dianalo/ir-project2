Part 791 of the ExportAdministration Regulations establishes the procedures and criteria forinitiating and reviewing claims of foreign availability. The Secretaryof Commerce is authorized by statute to determine foreign availability.In any case in which a determination is made that an item of comparablequality to a U.S. item controlled for national security purposes is availablein fact to a controlled country from a foreign source in quantities sufficientto render the control ineffective in meeting its purposes, the Secretarymay not require a validated license for its export.On January 25, 1988, OFA formally undertook an assessment of the foreignavailability of personal computers at the performance level of AT-CompatibleMicrocomputers controlled under ECCN 1565A on the Commodity Control List.The Departments of Defense and State, as well as other interested agenciesof the U.S. Government, have reviewed the report of that assessment.Based upon the assessment and the statutory criteria, I hereby determinethat foreign availability exists to controlled countries of desk top personalcomputers incorporating industry standard bus architecture, which havethe following characteristics: A total Processing Data Rate (PDR) no greaterthan 68 million bits per second; an internal memory (RAM) no greater than39 million bits; and a hard disk capacity not greater than 140 megabytes.This determination does not include computers that are ruggedized abovecommercial/office environment, highly portable personal computers or stand-alonegraphics workstations.Based on this determination, the Bureau of Export Administration is publishingregulations in the Rules section of this <T4>Federal Register</T4> to amend the national security export controlson these computers by removing the individual validated license requirementto all non-controlled destinations. The Department of Commerce also willbegin the process whereby the United States Government will work with CoordinatingCommittee (COCOM) member governments to reach agreement on an orderly changein the multilateral controls maintained on such computers when exportedto controlled countries. Upon completion of the COCOM review process, theDepartment of Commerce will make the appropriate changes to the regulations.If the Office of Foreign Availability receives substantive new evidenceaffecting this foreign availability determination, the assessment willbe reevaluated. Inquries concerning this assessment may be directed toDr. Irvin M. Pikus at the above address.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James M.
