(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Activists demonstrating this weekend atthe Seabrook nuclear power plant say the imminent start of atomictesting at the reactor should help their cause.   ``Now it's beginning to sound real. Before it was sounding kindof nebulous,'' Wes Crocheron of the anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliancesaid Friday night as the first demonstrators began trickling intothis seacoast town.   ``People are fired up against the nuke, especially now that theygot the low-power testing license,'' Crocheron said.   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave Seabrook a low-powertesting licence last week. The first atomic chain reaction isexpected at the reactor by the middle of next week.   The alliance was planning a major rally today at Hampton BeachState Park, on the crowded beach peninsula less than two miles fromSeabrook that is a focal point of the struggle over whether the $6billion reactor ever will operate commercially. Evacuation plansfor the beaches and communities up to 10 miles away from the plantmust be approved before the plant may operate commercially.   On Sunday, the activists plan a mass civil disobedience actionat the plant site. Clamshell spokesman Paul Gunter said at least300 to 500 people already had undergone non-violent civildisobedience training, and more training sessions were being heldthroughout the weekend.   On Friday, Superior Court Judge Vincent Dunn denied Seabrooktown officials' request for an injunction against Sunday'sdemonstration.   Seabrook police Chief Paul Cronin indicated Friday police mayarrest demonstrators before they reach the plant gates on Sunday.Some of the protesters hope to scale fences around the outer plantboundary and symbolically ``occupy'' the site.   Protest organizers hope this weekend's demonstrations will bethe largest in more than a decade at Seabrook. There have beenabout 2,500 arrests in protests that began when constructionstarted in 1976, including 1,414 arrests in a May 1977 protest thathelped make Seabrook a symbol of the nation's anti-nuclear movement.</TEXT></DOC>
