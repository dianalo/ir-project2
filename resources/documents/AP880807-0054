LEWIS</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Leaders of the Republican platform committeepredicted Sunday there will be no separate sections outliningminority views in the 1988 party platform, continuing a patternestablished in the Reagan campaign years of 1980 and 1984.   Gov. Kay Orr of Nebraska, the chairwoman of the platformcommittee, and Sen. Robert Kasten of Wisconsin, a co-chairman, alsosaid the committee's final public hearings this week will probablyencounter controversy on such issues as drug abuse, AIDS, rights ofthe handicapped and child care.   Kasten categorized the topics as ``newer issues ... not fullycovered'' in the 1980 and 1984 Republican platforms.   Aside from those issues, Orr said, ``we don't see a majordeparture'' from the 1984 platform, which she described as ``a goodfoundation for us.''   The 1984 GOP platform opposed any tax increases, contained nosupport for the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, and endorsedproposed constitutional amendments requiring a balanced federalbudget and giving the president power to veto specific items inbudget bills.   The GOP platform committee has been gathering testimony aroundthe country for several months. The panel's seven subcommitteeswill conclude hearings this week by drafting a platform forpresentation to the Republican National Convention during theevent's second night, Aug. 16.   ``We will be able to come to a consensus,'' Orr said. She saidshe also was making that forecast because members of the 106-personplatform committee have paid attention to the state Republicanplatforms.   Kasten said the final Republican document will be longer thanthe 5,200-word platform adopted by the Democrats at their nationalconvention last month in Atlanta.   The Democratic platform consisted of general principles. ``Ourplatform will be very specific,'' Kasten said.   Vice President George Bush, the all-but-nominated Republicanpresidential candidate, will testify before the panel Monday. He isexpected to urge the committee to adopt a detailed, specificplatform.   Other witnesses include conservative spokeswoman PhyllisSchlafly; Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the NAACP; MollyYard, president of the National Organization for Women; Contraleader Adolfo Calero; Dr. Edward Teller, the key developer of theH-bomb and a leading designer of the Star Wars missile defensesystem supported by the Reagan administration; an array of electedofficials from federal, state and local governments; andrepresentatives of various interest groups.</TEXT></DOC>
