Hutton Group Inc. for $960 million in cash and debt.    The merger will trigger job reductions of at least 5,000 to 6,000 employees, with most of the reductions coming from Hutton, sources familiar with the transaction said. The sources said Shearson hopes that about half the job cuts will come through attrition. Hutton currently has about 19,000 employees and Shearson has about 28,000.    The sources estimated that, largely because of geographical overlaps, 130 branch offices will be combined, leaving the new firm with 600. Currently, Hutton has about 400 offices and Shearson 330.    The area where the heaviest job cuts are slated is in order processing. Sizable cuts also are contemplated in institutional securities sales and trading, and investment banking. Shearson may sell Hutton's government bond dealership if a buyer comes along quickly, the sources added. Otherwise, the unit will be disbanded.    &quot;There will be people from both organizations who through no fault of their own will be severed,&quot; Peter A. Cohen, Shearson's chairman, said at a news conference yesterday.    Robert P. Rittereiser, Hutton's embattled chief executive officer, said no decision has been made on whether he will stay with the joint firm, which will take about six months to be fully integrated. Mr. Rittereiser, at the news conference, said he felt like a baseball pitcher who had struck out 12 batters, surrendered only three hits, but still lost the game, 1-0.    Mr. Rittereiser said in an interview that the merger agreement contains no job-protection clauses for himself or other top Hutton executives.    Under terms of the agreement, Shearson will make a tender offer of $29.25 a share for 85.4% of Hutton's 32.9 million shares outstanding. Shearson is offering a 10-year, senior subordinated debenture paying 10 3/4% annual interest for the remaining shares.    The debentures Shearson is offering Hutton shareholders will be issued by Shearson's Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. broker-dealer. They are callable after seven years, and will pay interest semi-annually.    Hutton holders will be paid on a pro-rata basis. For example, a holder tendering 100 shares is expected to get cash for 85 shares and debt for 15 shares. The debt is also said to be valued at $29.25 a share.    Under these terms, Shearson is paying $820 million in cash and $140 million in debt. Shearson said it will finance the cash portion with commercial paper and normal bank lines of credit.    Shearson said it expects to complete the transaction in about 60 days. The merger is subject to a majority of Hutton shareholders tendering their shares and to a ruling by the government that the merger poses no antitrust problems.    Shearson said that the combined firm would have total capital of about $3.7 billion, more than $102 billion of assets under management, 12,000 stockbrokers and 2.9 million clients, Shearson said.    Mr. Cohen said in a brief interview that the new name of the combined firm hasn't been determined. He said there is considerable sentiment at Shearson to rename the firm Shearson Lehman Hutton, but that such a decision would have to await extensive consumer marketing studies to determine which name would be best received by the public. Shearson has a long history of name changes as a result of several mergers.    The smiling faces at yesterday's news conference contrasted sharply with downcast stares of Hutton employees worried for their jobs. In Hutton's London trading room, staffers were grim. &quot;The employees (of Hutton) haven't been considered very much in this,&quot; one trader said. Said another staffer, &quot;I think the bond department is particularly worried.&quot;    In a related development, Peter G. Peterson, chairman of Blackstone Group, Hutton's co-adviser in the talks, said that Blackstone fully supported the decision made Tuesday by Hutton to negotiate exclusively with Shearson. Other participants in the talks had said Blackstone initially had opposed talks with Shearson.    Mr. Peterson, who wasn't reachable for comment on the earlier report, said that his firm had counseled early in the process that Hutton gauge the interest of other parties, but that after that had been done, Blackstone supported the Shearson talks and the agreement that was reached.    Shearson yesterday confirmed industry reports that it had been approached by representatives of L.F. Rothschild Holdings Inc. and that it would consider in the next few days acquiring Rothschild's retail sales network, which has about 250 brokers. The other firm that has expressed an interest in the network is Integrated Resources Inc.    Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., citing the costs of the merger, both placed certain Shearson debt under review for possible downgrading.    The agencies also changed their reviews of Hutton from possible downgrade to possible upgrade. It was concern that both agencies would soon lower their ratings on Hutton debt that influenced Hutton to seek a merger partner.    Sandamp;P said its review of Shearson affects about $3 billion of debt, including the firm's double-A senior debt and the Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. subsidiary's double-A-minus senior subordinated debt. Moody's said its review affects $1.65 billion of Shearson debt.    ---   Craig Forman in London contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
