Rescue workers said 10 to 25 people were trapped inside thebattered fuselage, which tore a nearly 500-foot-long path through aforest at the end of an airport runway, Agence France-Pressereported.   District government officials said two of the 82 injured peoplewere seriously hurt.   The Air France jetliner was making a demonstration flight at anair show, and many of its passengers were making their firstflight, district government officials said.   The plane's wings were broken and the cockpit windows smashed.The fuselage was blackened from smoke and was covered with whitefoam that firefighters were using to prevent a fire, AFP said.   The air show, which was expected to attract 30,000 people, washeld at Habsheim airport in Habsheim, a village of 3,600,government officials said. It is about 15 miles from theinternational airport of Mulhouse-Bale near the Swiss border.   The twin-engine Airbus A320 is a new model that went intoservice in April for Air France and British Airways.   An official at the Ministry of Transport in Paris said theaccident occurred at 2:50 p.m. (8:50 a.m. EDT) while the plane wasflying at a low altitude near the Habsheim airport. He spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Witnesses said the aircraft struck some trees at the end of arunway.   ``It was about 20 meters (65 feet) above the ground with itsflaps and landing gear down when it clipped some trees at the endof the runway and crashed in the forest,'' Bernard Labalette, anamateur pilot who was near the scene of the crash, was quoted byAFP as saying.   Other witnesses said they heard a series of explosions after thecrash.   Labalette was quoted as saying that rescue workers had adifficult time reaching the scene of the accident because it was inthe middle of a forest.   A 25-year-old woman passenger who did not give her name wasquoted by AFP as saying she heard trees brush against the fuselageafter the aircraft flew over the airport.   ``From then on things went fast,'' she said. ``The plane hit theground hard and we had the feeling of an abrupt jolt. Then therewas a fire in the front of the aircraft.''   Flight attendants deployed evacuation chutes and the woman saidshe and other passengers slid down them and ran from the aircraftbecause they feared an explosion.   According to the officials in the government office, who are notnamed under French practice, the pilot, Michel Asseline, and theco-pilot survived the crash ``shaken up but not injured.''   The Airbus A320 can carry 168 passengers. Airbus Industrie, itsmanufacturer, has 500 orders to purchase the craft.   According to Airbus officials, the plane was delivered to AirFrance last Thursday.   ``We are disturbed, shocked and saddened,'' said Airbus pressspokesman Robert Alizart in Toulouse, where the aircraft ismanufactured.   He said a team of experts from Airbus would be sent to the siteto determine the cause of the crash.   He said it was too early to say whether the future of theaircraft could be put in doubt.   The plane, built by a European consortium led by its French andGerman partners, received its certification Feb. 26.   It is the first aircraft equipped with electronic flight systemand controls that are beside the pilot instead of in front of him.It consumes 40 percent less fuel than similar two or three enginejets it is designed to replace.</TEXT></DOC>
