two years, $399 from Price Club,Sam's Wholesale Club, or TRW (you must live within 30 miles of a store)andM;Now that the 386SX-based PC has cemented its role as the entry-level machinein the marketplace, competition among manufacturers is fiercer than everbefore.andP;  Positive Corp.'s PC320X is well in the running for this particularcompetition.andP;  While its price of $1,699.99 and generous standardconfiguration make the Positive stand out as a real bargain, the machine'slimited expandability (dictated by the small-footprint case) underlines itsusefulness as a home-office computer.andM;Positive has stocked the machine with name-brand components, including anAcer motherboard and Panasonic floppy drives.andP;  The motherboard also supportsan optional $449 80387SX math coprocessor.andP;  The machine comes with a fairlystandard 640 by 480 VGA monitor bearing the Positive imprint (the use of VGA,rather than Super VGA, is one of the ways the company keeps the cost of themachine down).andP;  An identical version, with a 40MB IDE hard drive in place ofthe 106MB Maxtor IDE unit on the version tested, comes in at $1,499.99.andM;One of my first impressions of the Positive was its neat and unclutteredinterior.andP;  The reason everything is so accessible is because Positive hastaken the I/O, the video, and the hard/floppy drive controllers and put themon the motherboard where they are out of the way.andM;The system comes with four banks of eight slots for SIMMs; in their standardconfiguration, all slots are filled with 256K SIMM chips for a total of 2MBof 80-nanosecond RAM.andP;  The computer can be upgraded to a total of 4MB of Ramby replacing the first two banks with 1MB SIMMs (Positive charges $399 forthe extra 2MB.)andM;Given the small size of the PC320X, users would be essentially right not toexpect too much in the way of expansion.andP;  Positive manages to strike adelicate balance here: The PC320X's four 16-bit expansion slots are mountedvertically on a riser, or T-card, which in turn is stoutly clamped with a bigplastic clip that fastens itself to a metal brace running from the rear tothe front of the machine.andP;  Three of the four are available for use; thefourth is taken up with a standard 2,400-bps Hayes-compatible internal modem.andO;Formerly the modem was a $120 option, but now Positive is bundling it gratis.andM;Unlike some other machines, however, the PC320X does not allow the user muchflexibility when choosing floppy drives.andP;  The machine has only three drivebays, and since the tested unit comes standard with 1.2MB and 1.44MB floppydisk drives, there is no place to add, say, a tape backup.andP;  The power supplyfor the PC320X is a quiet, 145-watt Delta Electronics unit that stayed coolthrough extended use and is well matched to the machine.andM;Positive's generosity in outfitting the PC320X extends to the software thatcomes loaded in it.andP;  In addition to DOS 4.01 and Windows 3.0, complete with aserial mouse, Positive adds GW-Basic and two utilities disks, plus a month'sfree subscription to the Prodigy on-line service.andP;  Also bundled with Windowsare what Microsoft calls Working Models, which are functional, thoughlimited, versions of Project 1.0 (a project manager), Word for Windows, andExcel.andM;The PC320X comes with two manuals.andP;  One is a very handy systems manual thatoffers good advice with a comprehensive reference section, while the other isa somewhat superfluous overview pamphlet that really doesn't cover anythingnot in the systems manual.andM;Positive's service policies are somewhat different from the norm.andP;  Theyinclude a standard one-year parts-and-labor warranty and 30-day money-backguarantee.andP;  However, if you want onsite service, you must live within 30miles of either a Price Club or Sam's Wholesale Club store (Positive has astrong relationship with these two chains).andP;  This on-site sevice is free forthe first 30 days; after that, extended on-site programs of one and two yearsare available for $199 and $399, respectively.andM;Positive's PC320X is a great bargain in spite of its limited on-site servicepolicy.andP;  While the lack of universal on-site service may detract somewhatfrom its appeal, overall, the machine combines thoughtful engineering withsome very intelligent choices in software.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
