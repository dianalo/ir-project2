This subsection requires the Secretary of Agricultureto publish regulations defining the fruits, the vegetables, and the otherperishable commodities in which the field work related to planting, culturalpractices, cultivating, growing and harvesting will be considered ``seasonalagricultural services'' for purposes of the Act.On June 1, 1987, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) publishedits final rule defining the terms ``fruits,'' ``vegetables,'' and ``otherperishable commodities,'' as well as several other terms that were necessaryto an understanding of the definition of ``fruits,'' ``vegetables,'' and``other perishable commodities.''In the final rule, USDA defined the term ``fruits'' as ``the human edibleparts of plants which consist of the mature ovaries and fused other partsor structures, which develop from flowers or inflorescence.'' 7 CFR 1d.5.The term ``vegetables'' was defined as ``the human edible leaves, stems,roots, or tubers of herbaceous plants.'' 7 CFR 1d.10. The term ``otherperishable commodities'' was defined as ``those commodities which do notmeet the definition of fruits or vegetables, that are produced as a resultof seasonal field work, and have critical and unpredictable labor demands.''7 CFR 1d.7. ``Critical and unpredictable labor demands'' was defined tomean ``that the period during which field work is to be initiated cannotbe predicted with any certainty 60 days in advance of need.'' 7 CFR 1d.3.USDA explained that ``critical and unpredictable labor demands'' was definedto make it clear that the use of alien workers is predicated upon circumstanceswhich create the critical, yet unpredictable demand for a labor force onshort notice. 52 FR 13247 (April 22, 1987). An exclusive list of thosecommodities that were determined to be subject to critical and unpredictablelabor demands was provided within the definition of ``other perishablecommodities,'' as well as a list of examples of commodities that were determinedto be not subject to critical and unpredictable labor demands. 7 CFR 1d.7.Sugar cane was listed as an example of a commodity that was not a fruitor vegetable and was determined to be not subject to critical and unpredictablelabor demands. <T3>Id. </T3>On July 11, 1988, at 53 FR 26076-81, USDA requested public comment on aproposed rule that redefined the term ``vegetables'' and reexamined whetherthe commodity sugar cane meets the definition of ``vegetables'' or thedefinition of ``other perishable commodities,'' in light of the remandof those issues to the Secretary of Agriculture from the United StatesDistrict Court for the District of Columbia in <T3>Northwest Forest Workers Association, et al. v. Richard E. Lyng, etal., </T3>Civil Action No. 87-1487 (D.D.C. April 25, 1988) (hereinafter``<T3>NWFWA v. Lyng</T3>''). The comment period closed July 26, 1988. USDAreceived 13 comments on the proposed rule during the comment period. Thecomments received are discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>VegetablesUSDA proposed to define ``vegetables'' for purposes of the Act as ``thehuman edible herbaceous leaves, stems, roots, or tubers of plants, whichare eaten, either cooked or raw, chiefly as the principal part of a meal,rather than as a dessert.'' 53 FR 26081 (July 11, 1988).One commenter, while supporting the proposed definition of ``vegetables''as the correct scientific definition of the term, suggested that USDA shouldalso define the term ``fruits'' in horticultural terms. This commenterasserted that ``fruits'' and ``vegetables'' should be defined accordingto common usage on the basis of the principle of statutory constructionthat the common definition of a statutory term is to be presumed. Further,this commenter stated that a `` `common' or horticultural definition of<T3>both </T3>fruits and vegetables'' would be closer to congressionalintent. In addition, this commenter argued that the rationale given byUSDA to retain a botanical definition of the term ``fruits,'' <T3>i.e., </T3>``in order to be more precise in distinguishing fruits fromvegetables,'' 53 FR 26079 (July 11, 1988), is inadequate in that the crucialissue is to distinguish between activities that are within or without ofthe scope of ``seasonal agricultural services,'' rather than distinguishingbetween fruits and vegetables. Another commenter argued the same principleof statutory construction as the previous commenter, <T3>i.e., </T3>that the common meaning of a statutory term is to be presumed,but in contrast came to an opposite conclusion that instead of a horticulturaldefinition, a botanical definition of the term ``vegetables'' should beused. This commenter asserted that the ``common'' meaning of the term ``vegetables''is generally, ``any plant.''One commenter argued that the original botanical definition of ``vegetables''promulgated by USDA should be used, but without the ``herbaceous'' limitation.While the previous commenter asserted that the definition should be ``anyplant,'' this commenter asserted that the accepted botanical definitionof ``vegetables,'' is ``any edible part of a plant that is not derivedas a product of sexual reproduction, <T3>i.e., </T3>not a fruit.'' <T3>Id. </T3>USDA notes that the phrase ``a product of sexual reproduction''is not an accepted botanical definition of the term ``fruits.''One commenter discussed the horticultural definition of ``vegetables,''asserting that it is vague and imprecise and argued that the horticulturalclassification of plants will vary according to where they are grown, howcultivated, and the use to which they are put. This commenter stated thatit is contrary to the nature of horticultural classifications to establishrigid boundaries.One commenter argued that horticulture was inappropriate as a source ofthe definition of ``vegetables'' because horticulture is not a pure science,and is generally restricted to those crops in which plants are grown as``individuals,'' <T3>i.e., </T3>``garden crops,'' as opposed to field crops. Thus, thiscommenter argues, USDA implicitly has incorporated into the definitionof ``vegetables'' limitations relating to the intensity of labor used inthe production of a crop. Based on this characterization of horticulture,this commenter states that ``[b]oth the legislative history and the plainlanguage of the statutory provisions for the Special Agricultural Worker(SAW) program make clear that Congress intended that program to apply toall agricultural crops, not just select garden crops.''Several commenters argued that USDA should not mix a botanical definitionof the term ``fruits'' with a horticultural definition of the term ``vegetables.''One commenter asserted that USDA failed to explain why Congress would haveintended USDA to adopt two completely different conceptual approaches todefining ``fruits and vegetables of every kind.''Noting that there is much overlap between the botanical definition of ``fruits''and the horticultural definition of ``vegetables,'' one commenter arguedthat the USDA proposed rule assumes that Congress intended to repeat itselfin large measure in the phrase ``fruits and vegetables of every kind.''This commenter asserts that such a result is contrary to traditional principlesof statutory construction. Next, this commenter asserts that the use ofbotanical terms to describe the plant parts that are within the scope ofthe term ``vegetables'' so as to exclude fruits is unsupported becausethose terms have no meaning and basis in established horticultural definitions.Finally, this commenter states that these limitations, <T3>i.e., </T3>the use of botanical terms to describe the plant parts,would be unnecessary if USDA adopted a consistent approach, either botanicalor horticultural.Several commenters supported USDA's proposed definition of the term ``vegetables.''One commenter, a professor of soil science in the agronomy department ofa state university, stated that the horticultural definition of the term``vegetables'' is appropriate because the term ``is of horticultural origin.''Another commenter, an associate professor and certified professional agronomistand soil scientist at a state university institute of food and agriculturalsciences, stated that ``the botanical definition of `fruits' and the horticulturaldefinition of `vegetables' recommended for use in the rule are those whichcorrectly describe the agricultural products in question.'' A third commenter,the director of research and soil scientist-agronomist for the largestsugar cane producer in the United States, stated that ``[t]here is no botanicaldefinition of the term `vegetable' and, therefore, it is reasonable touse a horticultural definition.''As the court in <T3>NWFWA v. Lyng </T3>noted, the Act gives the Secretary broad discretionin defining ``fruits'' and ``vegetables.'' <T3>NWFWA v. Lyng, </T3>C.A. No. 87-1487, slip op. at 18 (D.D.C. April25, 1988). The court found that it was reasonable to define fruits andvegetables ``in scientific terms,'' noting that ``Congress never indicatedthat an everyday definition of fruits and vegetables was to be used overa scientific definition,'' and that the plaintiffs failed ``to demonstratethat a `common' definition exists.'' <T3>NWFWA v. Lyng, </T3>C.A. No. 87-1487, slip op. at 18-19 (D.D.C. April25, 1988). As the comments discussed above demonstrate, there is no ``common''definition of the term ``vegetables.'' The scientific definition of ``vegetables''incorporated in this regulation is not a ``common usage'' definition; rather,it is a scientific definition.In determining the definitions of both ``fruits'' and ``vegetables,'' USDAtook the same conceptual approach. Both definitions are based on the scientificliterature. Thus, the distinction made by some commenters that USDA hasapplied two completely different conceptual approaches or that the definitionsare incompatible is meritless.Because the term ``fruit'' is recognized in virtually all of the scientificsources reviewed by USDA as generally the mature, sexual reproductive organof a seed plant, 53 FR 26078 (July 11, 1988), it is appropriate to continueto define ``fruits'' as ``the human edible parts of plants which consistof the mature ovaries and fused other parts of structures, which developfrom flowers or inflorescence.'' 7 CFR ld.5. A review of the horticulturalsources reveals that this botanical definition is recognized also in thefield of horticulture as the appropriate and accepted definition of ``fruits.''However, a review of the scientific literature reveals that the term ``vegetables''is a horticultural term. Therefore, it is appropriate to define ``vegetables''on the basis of a consensus horticultural definition, with reasonable limitingfactors based on the scientific literature, congressional intent, and commonsense.In response to the comment that asserted that horticulture is limited to``garden crops'' and, thus, inappropriate for the source of the definitionof ``vegetables,'' USDA agrees that Congress did not intend the SAW programto be limited to ``garden crops.'' It is clear from the legislative historyand the plain language of the statute that Congress did <T3>not </T3>intend the SAW program to apply to <T3>all </T3>agricultural crops. However, the science of horticulture isnot limited to ``garden crops,'' and is in fact a science. Whatever theproper characterization of horticulture, it is clear from the scientificsources that the term ``vegetables'' is a horticultural term and, therefore,it is appropriate to look to horticulture for the proper and accepted scientificdefinition of that term.In response to the comment that asserted that horticulture is inappropriatebecause the classification of a crop as a ``vegetable'' will vary accordingto where it is grown, how it is cultivated, and how it is used, USDA believesthat a horticultural definition is appropriate because ``vegetables'' isa horticultural term. The definition of ``vegetables'' adopted by USDAcorrectly describes what is a ``vegetable'' as that term is recognizedgenerally in the scientific literature. The Act relates to ``seasonal agriculturalservices'' performed by aliens in the United States during the 12-monthperiod ending May 1, 1986. 8 U.S.C. 1160(a). The fact that a plant maybe classified as a ``vegetable'' some time in the future is academic andirrelevant. The classification of a crop as a ``vegetable'' will not varyaccording to where it is grown; it will depend on whether it is ``the humanedible herbaceous leaves, stems, roots, or tubers of plants, which areeaten, either cooked or raw, chiefly as the principal part of a meal, ratherthan as a dessert. The classification of a plant as a ``vegetable'' willnot vary according to how the crop is cultivated. However, for a SAW applicantto qualify under the Act, that applicant must have performed ``field work''as defined in the regulations. The classification of a crop as a ``vegetable''will depend on how that crop is used; it must be ``eaten, either cookedor raw, chiefly as the principal part of a meal, rather than as a dessert.''Because the classification of crops must be made on a commodity-by-commoditybasis, the classification of a crop based on its use will not vary generally.If a crop produces ``human edible herbaceous leaves, stems, roots, or tubers. . . which are eaten, either cooked or raw, chiefly as the principal partof a meal, rather than as a dessert,'' then that crop meets the definitionof ``vegetables'' and the fact that the plant may be put to other useswill not disqualify the crop. On the national scope, any significant changein use or the introduction of a new plant crop, to the extent that it resultsin the reclassification of a crop or the addition of a new vegetable, likelywill have no bearing on the SAW program because the relevant timeframefor SAW applicants is the 12-month period ending May 1, 1986, and sucha change in use or introduction of a new crop on a national scope is unlikelyto occur during the relevant period for replenishment special agriculturalworkers (beginning with fiscal year 1990 and ending with fiscal year 1993).8 U.S.C. 1161.In response to the comment that argued that the use of a botanical definitionof ``fruits'' and a horticultural defintion of ``vegetables'' results inconsiderable overlap and, thus, assumes that Congress meant to repeat itselfin large measure with the phrase ``fruits and vegetables of every kind'',USDA believes that this argument is meritless. The only generally accepteddescription of ``vegetables'' contained in the botanical sources is generally``any plant,'' <T3>i.e.,</T3> used as an adjective to describe the vegetable kingdom.The adoption of such a description as the definition of ``vegetables''would result in a complete overlap between ``fruits'' and ``vegetables.''This overlap could be remedied simply by stating that any plant part whichis not a fruit is a vegetable. However, this would be overly broad andinconsistent with the task given by Congress to the Secretary to definethese terms. The ``human edible'' limitation would have to be applied,as well as other reasonable limiting factors. In any event, under any approach,there would be considerable overlap between the definitions of ``fruits''and ``vegetables,'' and various limiting factors would have to be applied.Thus, it was reasonable for USDA to look to the horticultural definitionof ``vegetables'' as the basis for the definition of ``vegetables'' becausethe term is a horticultural term. The description of ``vegetables'' as``any plant'' was rejected by USDA as overbroad because it refers to thevegetable kingdom, as opposed to animal or mineral. Clearly, Congress didnot intend to include all plants with the phrase ``fruits and vegetablesof every kind and other perishable commodities.'' Congress could have saidsimply, ``all plants.''One commendter argued that the statutory phrase ``fruits and vegetablesof every kind,'' evinces a congressional intent that the definition of``vegetables'' should be construed liberally, and, thus, does not allowfor any of the limitations incorporated in the USDA proposed definition.Two commenters argued that the definitions of ``fruits'' and ``vegetables''should not be modified by the ``human edible'' limitation. One of thesecommenters cited the case of <T3>National Cotton Council of America, et al. v. Richard E. Lyng, et al.,</T3>Civil Action No. CA-5-87-0200 (N.D. Tex. February 8, 1988) (hereinafter<T3>``National Cotton Council of America v. Lyng''</T3>). This commenterargued that, either the ``human edible'' limitation should be eliminatedor clarified to indicate that a crop is ``human edible'' if it is capableof being eaten by humans either before or after processing, even if itsprimary or sole use is for livestock feed or other agricultural uses, andnot for human consumption. The decision in <T3>National Cotton Council of America v. Lyng</T3> is limted to the specificissue in that case, <T3>i.e.,</T3> whether cotton meets the definition of ``fruits.'' Thus,USDA believes that the decision in <T3>National Cotton Council of America v. Lyng</T3> has no precedentialvalue as to other commodities.Another commenter, on the other hand, stated that USDA ``is indubitablycorrect in its finding that `human edible' is a necessary limitation toany of the definitions of fruit or vegetable under discussion.''The court in <T3>NWFWA v. Lyng</T3> found that the limiting factor of ``human edible''was ``explained adequately and extensively'' in the notice of proposedrulemaking. <T3>NWFWA v. Lyng,</T3> C.A. No. 87-1487, slip op. at 16 andamp; n.8. Thus,USDA has determined that the limiting factor of ``human edible'' is reasonableand necessary to the proper definition of ``vegetables.''One commenter, while asserting that USDA should define ``vegetables'' asany edible part of a plant that is not a fruit, <T3>i.e.,</T3> without modfying ``vegetables'' by the ``herbaceous'' limitingfactor, argued that the proper definition of a non-herbaceous or woodystem is secondary growth through a vascular cambium, and that all otherplants are herbaceous. This commenter asserted that there are exceptionsto this rule, but that no scientists have included sugarcane within thewoody category. On the other hand, two scientists commented that the ``herbaceous''limitation was reasonable because woody plant parts are indigestible byhumans. Also, as one of these scientists noted, the ``herbaceous'' limitationis a reasonable limitation because many of the published scientific definitionsof the term ``vegetables'' include the ``herbaceous'' limitation.An examination of the scientific literature reveals that, while some scientificsources define ``herbaceous'' as a seed plant which develops little orno secondary woody tissue, the term ``herbaceous'' is defined in most scientificsources as generally a seed plant that does not develop woody tissues.Thus, USDA has determined that ``herbaceous'' for purposes of the definitionof ``vegetables'' should be defined as non-woody because woody plant partsare indigestible by humans. In addition, USDA has determined that the term``herbaceous'' should be applied to the specific plant part that constitutesthe commodity in order to include as ``vegetables'' non-woody parts ofwoody plants that are eaten, either cooked or raw, chiefly as the principalpart of a meal, rather than as a dessert. One commenter stated that the purpose of the ``principal part of a meal''clause is to include as vegetables non-sweet fruits, <T3>e.g., </T3>corn, tomatoes, and cucumbers, which are eaten chiefly asthe principal part of a meal. On the basis of this assertion, this commenterconcludes that the ``principal part of a meal'' clause is superfluous becauseUSDA has excluded fruits from the definition of ``vegetables'' by describingthe included plant parts in botanical terms so as to exclude fruits. Inaddition, this commenter noted that many of the scientific sources referto a ``vegetable'' as a plant part which is eaten ``with'' or ``during''the principal part of a meal, referring to time only, while the proposedrule states that a vegetable is a plant part which is eaten ``chiefly <T3>as </T3>the principal part of a meal, rather than as a dessert,'' whichrequires more than merely a concurrence in time. Because this commenterbelieves that the ``principal part of a meal'' clause is superfluous, thiscommenter concludes that there is no basis for the phrase ``chiefly asthe principal part of a meal, rather than as a dessert.''USDA has determined that the ``principal part of a meal'' clause not onlydelineates the time at which vegetables are eaten, it also establishesthat a vegetable is a plant part that is a principal component in a maindish or side dish. It is clear from the context of the discussions of thehorticultural definition of the term ``vegetables'' in the scientific sourcesthat ``vegetables'' does not include spices, herbs, flavorings, sweeteners,condiments, medicines, or plant parts which may be eaten by only a fewpersons as a novelty. This approach is also dictated by common sense. Otherwise,anything that is derived from herbaceous plants that finds its way intothe principal course of a meal or is consumed concurrently with the principalcourse of a meal would be considered a vegetable. Such a broad interpretationof the definition would be overinclusive and would lead to a number ofanomalies that clearly would exceed congressional intent. Coffee, condiments,flavorings, honey, hops, molasses, oils, spices, sugar, syrup, teas, andmedicines are all commodities that may be consumed during the main courseof a meal, but are not considered to be vegetables. However, such is theresult if common sense is not applied to the application of the definitionof the term ``vegetables.'' Furthermore, the ``rather than as a dessert''element in that clause refers not only to time, but serves also to describe``vegetables'' as non-sweet. It is arguable that the ``rather than as adessert'' element may serve only to include as ``vegetables'' non-sweetfruits. However, this clause is contained in many of the published horticulturaldefinitions and no purpose would be served by its elimination. Retainingthe ``rather than as a dessert'' clause may serve also to distinguish plantsthat are used primarily as spices, herbs, flavorings, sweeteners, condiments,and medicines. Therefore, the ``chiefly as the principal part of a meal,rather than as a dessert'' clause is not superfluous. Two commenters suggested that the USDA definition of ``vegetables'' istoo narrow and restrictive in that it results in the exclusion of certainparts of certain plants that are commonly considered to be vegetables.These commenters suggested that rhubarb, cassava, onions, and parsley wouldfall outside of the scope of the definition of ``vegetables'' due to therequirement that the plant part be eaten, cooked or raw, chiefly as theprincipal part of a meal, rather than as a dessert. Rhubarb is frequentlyeaten as a stewed or steamed vegetable side dish chiefly as the principalpart of a meal, rather than as a dessert. The cassava is a starchy tuberwhich is used in the same ways that a potato is used, <T3>e.g., </T3>boiled and used in soups or stews; sliced and fried likepotato chips; or mashed and substituted for potato in recipes for bakedgoods. In addition, some varieties of sweet cassava may be eaten raw. Althoughrhubarb and cassava, like sweet potato and pineapple, may be used alsofor dessert does not negate the fact that these commodities meet the definitionof ``vegetables.'' Onions, served cooked or raw, clearly are eaten as theprincipal part of a meal, rather than as a dessert. The fact that onionsalso may be used as a spice or flavoring does not negate the fact thatonions meet the definition of ``vegetables.'' USDA agrees that parsleydoes not meet the definition of ``vegetables.'' Parsley is a culinary herbwhich is not eaten chiefly as the principal part of a meal, rather thanas a dessert. Although parsley may be used as a spice or a garnish witha dish eaten as the principal part of a meal, parsley is not itself eatenas the principal part of a meal. A spice, flavoring, or garnish is nota principal component of a main dish or side dish, and, thus, does notmeet the definition of ``vegetables.''Sugar CaneSeveral commenters stated that sugar cane did not meet the definition of``vegetables,'' while several other commenters suggested that sugar canedid meet the definition. Most of the comments focused on the stalk of the sugar cane in discussingwhether or not it met the definition of ``vegetables.'' Some commentersdiscussed the processed sugar derived from sugar cane as the commodityin question. One commenter stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he ``vegetable'' primarily under discussion is granulated canesugar rather than whole pieces of the cane which are distributed in modestquantities through specialty food markets. This concept simplifies thediscussion. To the extent that sugar cane may be woody and non-herbaceous,the granulated cane sugar is the extracted herbacious [sic] part of thecane.</ITAG>Under the plain language of the Act, the SAW program is limited to ``seasonalagricultural services,'' meaning ``the performance of field work relatingto planting, growing and harvesting of fruits and vegetables of every kindand other perishable commodities.'' The commodity in question, therefore,is the sugar cane, as opposed to the sugar which is produced from the cane,because only the cane is the product of field work. In addition; sugaris not a plant part; rather, it is a compound derived from plants.Sugar may be any number of various water soluble compounds that vary widelyin sweetness and comprise the oligosacchrides, including sucrose and fructose.Cane sugar is wholly or essentially sucrose. Sucrose is present in manyplants, but is obtained commercially from sugar cane or sugar beet, andless extensively from sorghum, maples, and palms. Several commenters notedthe importance of sugar cane as a crop and the importance of sugar as acomponent in the human diet. Some commenters noted that the per capitaconsumption of sugar in the United States is more than 100 pounds of sugarper year. None of these commenters noted what percentage of that sugarconsumption is sugar produced from sugar cane and what percentage is fromother sources. While USDA acknowledges the importance of sugar as a commodityand recognizes that Americans consume a significant amount of sugar intheir diets, this is not determinative of whether sugar cane is a vegetable.Some commenters argued that sugar cane is ``human edible'' because sugarcane may be chewed. USDA believes that the chewing of cane and the factthat sugar is human edible does not mean necessarily that sugar cane is``human edible'' for purposes of the regulation.One commenter, an associate professor and certified professional agronomistand soil scientist at a state university institute of food and agriculturalsciences and one of the nation's leading experts on sugar cane, noted thatthe sugar cane stalk is not edible. This expert noted that selected softvarieties of sugar cane may be grown in gardens as ``chewing'' cane, butthat this production is very minimal. Another commenter, stated that ``[t]heminute amount of sugarcane which is `chewed' (not eaten) as a novelty wouldhardly be sufficient to classify the crop as a fruit or vegetable by anyreasonable standards.'' A third commenter, the vice president and directorof research for the nation's largest sugar cane producer, stated that,while some people may suggest that sugar cane is chewed by humans, in nocase is sugar cane actually eaten because the harvested part of the cane,the mature stalk, is highly fibrous and not digestible by humans.Several commenters stated that sugar cane was herbaceous. One commenterargued that the only accepted scientific definition of ``herbaceous'' issecondary growth by a vascular cambium, and since grasses do not producesecondary growth through a cambium layer, sugar cane is herbaceous. Thiscomment ignores the fact that ``herbaceous'' is defined generally in mostof the scientific literature as ``non-woody.'' Thus, the issue is whethersugar cane is woody.One commenter compared sugar cane to an artichoke, described by this commenteras a woody or fibrous vegetable. This commenter stated that very littleof the artichoke plant is edible and that part only after cooking, andthat at least a comparable part of sugar cane is edible even without cooking.The marketed portion of the artichoke is the herbaceous bud, which is actuallyan immature flower head, made up of numerous closely interlaid bracts orscales upon a receptacle. The edible portion of the artichoke consistsof the tender bases of the bracts, the young flowers, and the receptacleor fleshy base upon which the flowers are borne. Although the bracts arefibrous, the edible portions of the artichoke are herbaceous modified leavesand stems which are eaten, cooked, chiefly as the principal part of a meal,rather than as a dessert. Thus, artichoke meets the definition of ``vegetables.''Several commenters stated that sugar cane was not herbaceous. Those commenterswho stated that sugar cane was not herbaceous noted that the stems of thesugar cane plant contain large amounts of lignin and other fibrous materialwhich are very indigestible to humans, and that sugar cane is more likea woody plant than an herbaceous plant. An associate professor of sugarand energy crops at a state university agricultural research center, noted:<ITAG tagnum="21">A few varieties (those used for chewing) might have a fiber contentlow enough (5 to 8%) to be called herbaceous. Some sugarcane forms, however,are so fibrous (20%) that they are used as a substitute for wood in constructionof fences, roofs, and wattles and partition walls. Even those varietiesused for sugar production would seem woody if chewed.</ITAG>The vice president of research of the nation's largest sugar company stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">Once the sugar and water has been extracted from the stalk, the biomassresidue is actually burned as boiler fuel to run our mills, and in thepast has been made into fiber board.</ITAG>An examination of the scientific literature reveals that some scientistsdo describe sugar cane as ``woody,'' and, thus, non-herbaceous. Becausesugar cane, in the same manner as wood, is indigestible and not suitableas food, USDA has concluded that sugar cane does not have the essentialcharacteristic of an herbaceous part of a plant.Several commenters noted that sugar cane is not eaten, cooked or raw, chieflyas the principal part of a meal, rather than as a dessert. Other commentersstated that sugar cane is eaten as the principal part of a meal, ratherthan as a dessert. Some commenters noted that sugar is a significant componentin many non-dessert foods, including soft drinks, non-carbonated beverages,confections, baked goods, processed foods, canned vegetables, breakfastproducts, and various other foods, or added directly to food eaten as theprincipal part of a meal. USDA has determined that such use is as a sweetenerrather than as a main dish, side dish, or principal component in a maindish or side dish eaten chiefly as the principal part of a meal.Several commenters noted that sugar cane may be chewed or sucked on andcould be found in some produce markets. These commenters asserted thatthe chewing of sugar cane indicated that sugar cane is edible and is infact eaten. Other commenters stated that the chewing of cane is not the``eating'' of sugar cane, that sugar cane is indigestible and that theeating of sugar cane could be deleterious to human health. Eating is theprocess of taking into the mouth, chewing, and swallowing. While it istrue that people swallow the juice from the cane, this is not the swallowingof the cane. Sugar cane marketed by a produce distributor in Californiaand available in some East Coast supermarkets labels its packages of sugarcane with the cautionary notices: ``Do not swallow;'' ``Not recommendedfor children under 5 or persons with braces.'' Recipes printed on the packagingsuggest the use of sugar cane as a garnish only. While the juice of thesugar cane is digestible, the cane itself is not digestible by humans.USDA has determined that these facts indicate that the small amount ofsugar cane which is chewed fails to establish that sugar cane is eatenraw. Some commenters stated that sugar cane is served cooked as the principalpart of a meal, rather than as a desert. One commenter included the menuof a Washington, DC, Vietnamese restaurant which serves ``Blended JumboShrimp wrapped around a core of fresh sugar cane (season) and grilled_ChaoTom.'' Upon investigation, USDA determined that such sugar cane is noteaten, but serves as a sweetener, not as a vegetable. A review of variousethnic cookbooks demonstrated that sugar cane is used as a sweetener inthese dishes and may be disposed of prior to serving, after the sugar hasimparted its sweetness in the dish, or the sugar cane may remain in thedish when served, but in no event is the sugar cane eaten. The sugar caneused in these dishes may be chewed on, but the cane is not swallowed. Thus, USDA has determined that sugar cane is not a herbaceous stem whichis eaten, either cooked or raw, chiefly as the principal part of a meal,rather than as a dessert. Therefore, sugar cane is not a vegetable. In <T3>NWFWA v. Lyng, </T3>the court upheld the USDA definition of ``otherperishable commodities'' as ``those commodities which do not meet the definitionof fruits or vegetables, that are produced as a result of seasonal fieldwork, and have critical and unpredictable labor demands.'' <T3>NWFWA v. Lyng, </T3>C.A. No. 87-1487, slip op. at 8-14 (D.D.C. April25, 1988). The court agreed also that unpredictable labor demands meantthat the period during which field work was to be initiated cannot be predictedwith any certainty within 60 days in advance of need. <T3>Id. </T3>USDA explained that ``critical and unpredictable labor demands''was defined to make it clear that the use of alien workers is predicatedupon circumstances which create the critical, yet unpredictable demandfor a labor force on short notice. 52 FR 13247 (April 22, 1987). USDA determined that sugar cane did not meet the definition of ``otherperishable commodities'' because the production of sugar cane does notinvolve critical and unpredictable labor demands. Labor demands with respectto the production of sugar cane are reasonably predictable more than 60days in advance, and extreme conditions, such as severe freezes or storms,do not create a critical need for additional labor significantly abovethe level that is predicted months in advance. One commenter, a professor of soil science in the agronomy department ofa state university, noted that sugar cane is not a perishable commoditysince it is very robust and can withstand extremes in weather such as hotor cold, wet or dry conditions with a minimum of damage. Such conditionsare generally not critical for the sugar industry except under extremecircumstances in which case an additional labor force would be of littleuse. Normal drought conditions which would decimate vegetables such aslettuce or cabbage may reduce the growth rate of sugar cane, but wouldnot kill it, and, in fact, would increase the sucrose content of the cane.When water was again available, the sugar cane would resume growth. Similarly,a freeze which would kill most vegetable crops and damage fruit resultingin their complete loss of marketability, may kill the leaves of sugar cane,and if the freeze was very severe, may kill the stalks. However, this wouldnot necessarily mean that the crop would be lost since the sucrose in thestalks does not deteriorate under cool conditions and may remain harvestablefor several weeks. Therefore, the sugar growers can continue harvestingthe crop at the normal rate for several weeks after a freeze and may notsuffer a major loss of yield. Thus, while there is a real emergency needfor labor to harvest the commodity before and after a freeze with respectto fruit and vegetable crops, with respect to sugar cane, harvesting continuesat the normal rate since the sugar mills have limited capacity to processcut cane. Thus, because sugar cane does not experience the critical needfor a significant number of laborers in addition to anticipated levelsas a result of unforeseen events, it does not experience critical and unpredictablelabor demands. Sugar cane maturity is a matter of period of growth and weather. When thecane has nearly completed its growth in the fall, the normal low temperaturesthat occur serve to increase the sucrose content by reducing growth andincreasing sucrose storage. However, the sucrose content of the major partof the stalk has been determined by the growing conditions earlier in thecrop. Therefore, fields that have attained sufficient growth may be harvestedat any time in the cool months of the year without a major loss of sucrose.Other things being equal, fields that are subject to low temperatures fora longer period generally have a higher sucrose content than those thathave not experienced low temperatures. Generally, fields are scheduledfor harvest from the beginning of the growing cycle depending on such factorsas planting, ratooning schedules, and mill capacity. This results in laborscheduling for all components of sugar cane production at the beginningof the crop which is generally maintained until the end of the harvest.There is a clear expression of congressional intent that the SAW programwas to include as ``other perishable commodities'' crops which ``must beharvested by hand, thereby requiring a large number of workers on shortnotice,'' and not ``where mechanical harvesters can be used . . .'' 131Cong. Rec. S11322 (September 12, 1985) (statement of Sen. Wilson); <T3>see also </T3>131 Cong. Rec. S11325 (September 12, 1985) (statementof Sen. Hatch); 131 Cong. Rec.

Rep. No. 99-682, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., Part 1, July 16, 1986,at p. 85. Mechanization affects labor demands in that the more mechanizedthe production of a particular crop is, the less critical and the morepredictable the labor demands are. Highly mechanized crops do not generallyexperience a critical need for a labor force on short notice. The sugar industry is highly mechanized except for some planting in somesugar producing areas and some harvesting in Florida. Machine plantingis utilized in Louisiana and Texas while manual labor is preferred in Florida.Fields are replanted usually every two to six years, although sugar canemay be rattooned for decades. Mechanical harvesting is utilized in allstates. In Louisiana and Texas, virtually all of the sugar cane is mechanicallyharvested. In Florida, on the other hand, the majority of the sugar caneis cut by manual labor. Since the planting, cultivation, cultural practices,growing and harvesting of sugar cane is mechanized for the most part, thisrepresents further evidence that sugar cane does not meet the criteriaof ``other perishable commodities.'' Sugar cane is harvested normally from November through March in Florida,October through March in Texas, from mid October through December in Louisiana,and almost year-round in Hawaii. Sugar yields are generally highest afterJanuary 1, but some fields must be harvested before they have reached maximumyield to allow time for processing the whole crop. Labor requirements areanticipated months or even years in advance, and can be forecast with reasonablecertainty since the harvest period is generally three to six months andthe commencement date is not critical. Sugar cane can stand unharvestedin the field for months. In some cases, sugar cane fields have been carriedover to be harvested during the following season. Various commenters offered examples of circumstances which they believerepresent critical and unpredictable labor demands. These include greaterdifficulty in harvesting tangled and recumbent cane following a storm;that sugar cane may be damaged by fire or freeze; freeze damaged cane requiresmore topping to remove trash; more freeze damaged cane must be cut to adequatelysupply the mill than would normally be necessary; freeze damaged cane mayrequire substitution of manual labor for machine harvesters; the harvestmay be advanced or delayed due to early maturity or by late ripening dueto weather or other factors; that sugar cane should be harvested at optimummaturity; that daily temperatures during the growing season is one of themost important factors influencing the optimum harvesting of cane; thatestimates of individual worker production may be inaccurate and if under-estimatedcould lead to an inadequate supply of labor; that adverse weather or inabilityto cultivate following fertilizer application could affect crop growthand maturity or lead to unanticipated weed growth; that planting may bedelayed if the weather is too wet or dry; the harvest may be delayed asa result of weather related delays at planting time; processors may insistthat planting be complete prior to harvest; planting may be delayed dueto unsatisfactory growth of seed cane; a delay in planting may compressthe planting period resulting in an increased demand for labor; the timingof planting and harvesting may be affected by the growth and maturity ofthe cane crop which in turn could be affected by the cultivation, pesticideapplications, and fertilization during the growing season; that the timingof some cultivation, and of some fertilizer and pesticide applications,may be unpredictable 60 days in advance. USDA recognizes that all of theseexamples are factors that affect sugar cane production and that most ofthem are typical of the problems that confront farmers generally. Nevertheless,a review of the labor demands of sugar cane production indicates that thelabor requirements of sugar cane are reasonably predictable more than 60days in advance of need, and that none of the factors cited above createsa need for additional labor significantly above the levels that had beenpredicted months in advance.Some commenters asserted that USDA was reaching beyond the intent of Congressin an effort to exclude H-2 sugar cane workers from the SAW program. Inall issues regarding this rule, USDA has been guided by the statute andthe legislative history of the Act. USDA defined ``critical and unpredictablelabor demands'' in terms of the 60-day bright line rule based on the legislativehistory of the IRCA which indicated that the SAW program was intended tobe a supplement to the H-2A program. The 60-day bright line cut off representsthe advance time that the Department of Labor requires normally of growerswho petition for temporary agricultural workers under the H-2A program.The court in <T3>NWFWA v. Lyng </T3>recognized that this interface between the SAW programand the H-2A program was supported by the legislative history. <T3>NWFWA v. Lyng, </T3>C.A. No. 87-487, slip op. at 12-13 (D.D.C. April25, 1988). Thus, the court found the 60-day bright line rule was reasonable.<T3>Id. </T3>at 13. Sugar cane producers have successfully utilized theH-2 program for decades under certification procedures which required employersto forecast their labor needs 80 days in advance. USDA determined thatthe use of the H-2 program by sugar cane producers demonstrated that sugarcane did not experience ``critical and unpredictable labor demands.'' Theability of sugar cane producers to forecast their labor requirements 60days in advance under the current H-2A program demonstrates that sugarcane is not within the scope of ``other perishable commodities.'' USDA notes that Congress did not intend the SAW program to be remedial.The legislative history of the Act contains expressions of explicit congressionalintent that the SAW program was not meant to confer legal rights to anypersons or groups. <T3>See </T3>132 Cong. Rec. H9870 (October 10, 1986) (Colloquy betweenRep. Weaver and Rep. Schumer) (confirming that the SAW program is not remedialin nature). Thus, the SAW program was not intended by Congress to provideresident alien status to all alien agricultural workers. Some commenters claimed an inconsistency by USDA in including tobacco asan ``other perishable commodity'' while excluding sugar cane since bothcommodities have used the H-2 program. USDA has determined that there isa substantial difference in the labor requirements between these two commodities.Tobacco experiences critical and unpredictable labor demands while sugarcane does not. USDA's knowledge is that while nearly all sugar cane harvestershave been H-2 workers, less than five percent of the tobacco workforcehas been employed through this program. There is confusion regarding a Senate colloquy which mentioned tobacco.USDA reviewed this question consistent with the labor requirements of thecommodity and the context of the statement and concluded that Congressdid not intend to exclude tobacco from ``other perishable commodities.''A number of commenters stated that sugar cane experiences critical andunpredictable labor demands in the event of a severe freeze: ``A freezedamages the cane stalk and requires harvesting within one to two weeksto avoid crop loss.'' (citing James E. Irvine, <T3>Effects of an Early Freeze on Louisiana Sugarcane, </T3>AgriculturalResearch Service, USDA, Houma, Louisiana, 1968. This study examined theeffects of a record November freeze for 92 days following that freeze andfound no significant change in stalk weight and a reduction in sucrosefrom 14.31% to 12.53%. Clearly, a freeze is not necessarily a criticalcondition, although it is recognized that sugar yields may be affectedby warm weather following a severe freeze. Following a freeze, growersdo rearrange their harvesting schedule to prioritize damaged fields ona worst first basis so as to salvage the maximum possible, but the dailytonnage to be harvested and labor required is still limited by the capacityof the mill to grind the cane. Dr. Irvine's 1968 analysis did not discusslabor requirements, but in commenting on this proposed rule Dr. Irvinewrote:<ITAG tagnum="21">The standing crop may be damaged by fire or freezes, and the latteris a limiting factor in sugarcane production in Louisiana. Even there,freezes are anticipated and the harvest is planned with an anticipatedend of harvest before freeze losses could be serious * * * . </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Whether damaged by fire or freeze, <T3>the mills are usually operating at near capacity and an extra effortto crush all damaged cane by multiplying the harvest effort is generallyimpractical. (emphasis added).</T3></ITAG>Several authorities, from each of the sugar cane producing states, commentedthat since mills operated normally at or near capacity, they would be unableto utilize additional labor to salvage damaged cane. Several commenters cited press reports that the Florida sugar cane industryhad hired additional workers in response to past freeze damage emergencies.One commenter stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">That sugar mills do not normally operate at full capacity is demonstratedby the article in the <T3>Belle Glade Herald, </T3>Feb. 3, 1977 * * * . That article notes thatfollowing the 1977 freeze, the sugar mills were able to increase theirgrinding output to record levels in the periods immediately following the1977 freeze. The increased output was the result of nearly 600 additionalcane harvesters who were hired after the freeze. In 1985, the lifting ofweight restrictions on trucks carrying sugar cane to the mills [by theGovernor's declaration of an emergency] was expected to allow the millsto increase production by ``as much as <T3>2,000 extra tons a day.</T3>'' [<T3>Palm Beach Post, </T3>Jan. 23, 1985]. (emphasis added).</ITAG>USDA is cognizant of news articles similar to those described above. Anincrease of 2,000 tons under emergency conditions would represent onlya 2 to 3 percent increase above the norm for the Florida sugar cane industry.USDA concludes that the cited report indicates that the sugar mills dooperate at near capacity.The news accounts of the 1977 freeze indicated that the United States SugarCorporation brought in 300 additional workers on an emergency basis. However,the Vice President of Research for that company maintains:<ITAG tagnum="21">During (the past 33 years), including the ten freezes, United StatesSugar Corporation <T3>never increased the number of sugar cane cutters over what was certifiedby the Department of Labor months prior to the start of the harvest.</T3>It is also interesting to note that in the four years 1981, 1983, 1984,and 1986, in which freezes occurred, the harvest continued to scheduledcompletion for 40, 70, 57 and 57 days after the freeze, respectively. Thisis dramatic proof that sugar cane is not perishable and explains why ourlabor needs do not vary from what we plan prior to the crop. (emphasisadded).</ITAG>In an effort to determine whether sugar cane growers experience criticaland unpredictable labor demands, USDA queried the Department of Labor asto whether the sugar cane industry had ever requested additional workerson an emergency basis. The response stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">During the seventeen years that I have been handling Florida sugarcane labor certification requests, <T3>the industry has not asked for additional labor certification on accountof freeze damage.</T3> The only exception to this occurred in January 1981,when some of the sugar cane growers asked for supplemental workers to replaceU.S. workers who did not report and for which certification had been reduced.This certification did not increase the number of workers certified abovethe number of workers requested earlier in the season. (emphasis added).</ITAG>The H-2A program regulations provide for the replacement of attrition lossesfor workers who return to their native countries and it is not unusualfor replenishment workers to be required. 600 of a work force of approximately10,000 would represent an attrition rate of about 6 percent. This appearsto account for the apparent disparity between the news accounts and therecords of the Department of Labor. In addition, this appears to explainthe inconsistency between the newspaper account of the 1977 freeze thatindicated that the United States Sugar Corporation brought in 300 additionalworkers on an emergency basis, and the comment of the Vice President ofResearch of that corporation who stated that his company has never askedfor additional labor certification from the Department of Labor on accountof freeze damage. In fact, the very same newspaper account, quoting thevice president of another large Florida sugar cane producer, states:<ITAG tagnum="21">William Miller, Vice President and General Manager of the Sugar CaneGrowers Cooperative of Florida, said new cane cutters arrived yesterdaymorning but that this was not done because of the freeze. He said <T3>the new men were brought in to make up for attrition</T3> over thepast months of the harvest since November.<T3> Palm Beach Post,</T3> Feb. 1, 1977.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Thus, although growers replace normally workers lost to attrition,the growers do not generally increase the number of workers in responseto a freeze over what they originally anticipated. One commenter stated that ``[t]he growers had requested and received certificationfor more workers than they had anticipated they would need; when the freezehit, the growers were able to bring in additional workers without certification.''USDA has concluded this is a specious argument. The Department of Labordetermines the employers need and limits the number of workers to be certified.In addition, growers are required to provide housing for the number ofworkers certified and this would be a practical obstacle to such a scheme.Moreover, surveys conducted by the Florida Department of Labor and EmploymentSecurity indicate that following the several freezes which have occurredsince 1981, employment levels of sugar cane cutters have been reduced ratherthen increased. In contrast, the employment of citrus workers increasedas much as 30 percent during efforts to salvage damaged fruit. Comments were received stating that following a storm or freeze, more laboris necessary to harvest the same amount of cane if it is tangled and recumbentand ``[h]and labor can cut off the top part of the cane and leave it inthe field. A mechanical harvester cannot do that; hand harvest labor isrequired. (<T3>Clewiston (Florida) News,</T3> Jan. 27, 1977).'' The cited articlemakes no mention of mechanical harvesting, however, other articles in therecord quote sugar industry officials following a severe freeze:<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he [H-2 workers] would cut as much of the damaged cane by handas they could because of the mechanical harvester's inability to determinethe proper cropping height of the cane stalks. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Vaughn said that approximately 30% of the volume of sugarcane beingcut presently is being cut by harvesting machines, but added that handcutters do a better job of cutting away freeze damaged cane than the machines.''<T3>Clewiston (Florida) News,</T3> January 6, 1982. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Hand labor is an advantage in harvesting damaged cane, according toYancey, because the decay starts at the top of the stalk and an experiencedcutter can lop off the damaged area and leave it in the field.''<T3> Clewiston News,</T3> (no date).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">These officials did not say hand harvest labor is<T3> required,</T3> but that hand cut cane is better or advantageous. USDArecognizes that whether normal or damaged, hand cut cane is of better qualitythan machine harvested cane, but USDA recognizes also that most sugar canegrowers harvest mechanically both normal and damaged cane. It is evidentthat the advantage of manual labor is not critical because machines areused to harvest damaged cane in Louisiana and Texas, and the Florida sugarindustry has not found it necessary to apply for additional H-2 certificationsin response to a freeze. Mechanical harvesters do cut off the top of thecane and leave it in the fields, and they may be adjusted to remove varyingamounts. However, machines do not do this as well as manual laborers. InHawaii, Louisiana, Texas, and to some degree, Florida, storm or freezedamaged cane is harvested with mechanical harvesters, rather than by manuallabor. Several commenters stated that sugar cane must be harvested at the optimumtime and noted that various factors could cause delays in the field workperformed by the sugar cane industry. They argued that such delays createcritical and unpredictable labor demands. A delay of sugar cane field work activity, while it may be undesirable,is not critical<T3> per se.</T3> It is necessary to look beyond the fact of the delayto determine its consequences and whether it requires a labor force onshort notice. Sugar cane growers have experienced delays of 60 days ormore in planting and harvesting in the past without critical labor demands;the season is extended instead. For example, in Louisiana, which is consideredto have the most sensitive timing of the sugar producing states with respectto planting and harvesting because of its susceptibility to freezes, growersmay accommodate delays in planting by extending the planting season by60 days or more:<ITAG tagnum="21">Planting season is from early August to mid-October. August and Septemberplantings give the highest yields.<T3> Unfavorable weather conditions often make it necessary to plant throughOctober and sometimes through November and December.</T3> Harvesting ofsugar cane in Louisiana begins in mid-October and ends in late December.The crop is only 7 to 8 months old when harvesting begins. It increasesin value, particularly on sucrose content, during October and November.However,<T3> the grower can't wait for his crop to reach peak maturity becausehe would risk losing much of it due to killing freezes.</T3> R.

In the 1977/1978 season,Florida experienced delay due to wet weather, while the Texas industrywas shut down for over two months because of rain. Some of the Texas cropwas carried over to the following season. Louisiana was late completingthe 1977 season. Rainy weather caused part of the 1978 crop in Hawaii tobe carried over to 1979. The 1978/1979 harvest in Texas was late followingfreezes in December and January. The 1979/1980 harvest was shut down forthree weeks due to wet weather. Florida, Louisiana, and Texas experienceddrought in 1980. The completion of the 1980/1981 season in Texas was delayedover 60 days due to wet fields, and some of the crop was carried over tothe 1981/1982 season. The Louisiana harvest was late finishing in the 1981and 1982 seasons. Because of extremely high rainfall in Hawaii, cane whichwould normally have been processed in 1982 was carried over into 1983.A severe Texas freeze in December damaged the 1983/84 crop so badly thatoutput fell from a potential 110,000 tons of cane sugar to about 60,000.Virtually all of the cane was harvested and processed, but after mid-January,it was processed into cane molasses. Two hurricanes in 1985 caused Louisianacane to be down and entangled and reduced yields and sugar content tento twenty percent. Growers increased the harvest time by cutting cane fromsunup to sundown rather than three hours each morning. However, this didnot create a need for additional labor. Louisiana achieved a productionincrease in 1986 despite above normal rainfall and the muddiest harvestperiod since 1972. In the 1986/1987 season, Texas was delayed over 60 daysdue to rain and some of the crop was carried over to the following season.Because of the unusually large crop in the 1987/1988 season, Florida startedits harvest early and extended it later than usual. USDA believes the abilityto extend the harvest period and otherwise cope with extreme irregularitieswithout an additional labor force indicates that the sugar cane industrydoes not experience critical and unpredictable labor demands.Some activities, such as the application of pesticides, fertilizer andirrigation, may become critical in a relatively short period of time. However,these are not labor intensive operations which would require a labor forceon short notice, but are mechanized activities performed by the normalwork complement. If delayed, the farmer may utilize the same worker whichhe intended to emply prior to the delay.After thorough review of labor demands with respect to sugar cane fieldactivities from planting through harvesting, the comments received, theauthoritative sources contained in the administrative record, and the recordof <T3>NWFWA v. Lyng,</T3> USDA determined that sugar cane field work is notsubject to critical and unpredictable labor demands.
