(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The space shuttle Atlantis continued itscross-country trip from California to Florida today, taking off froman Air Force base near Tucson atop a modified jumbo jet.   The orbiter, which landed at Edwards Air Force Base in Californialast week after completing a classified military mission, left theMojave Desert base at 3:27 p.m. Sunday, said Charlie Baker, shuttlearea manager for the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationat Edwards.   Carried piggyback atop a Boeing  reachedArizona's Davis-Monthan Air Force Base 90 minutes later, where itstayed overnight. The plane took off from the base shortly beforenoon on the next leg of its trip, headed to Kelly Air Force Baseoutside San Antonio, Texas.747, the shuttle   The final leg should take the shuttle from Kelly tothe KennedySpace Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., said NASA spokesman JosephD'Agostino.   Rain could delay completion of the flight, he said Sunday. Flyingthrough rain can damage the thousands of ceramic tiles affixed tothe shuttle's belly to ward off the heat of re-entry into theEarth's atmosphere, he said.   Atlantis landed Tuesday after a four-day secret mission thatreportedly included deployment of a med to a mechanical air pump so thebear mimics thedeep, gentle inhaling and exhaling of a healthy, sleeping person.   A research project under way at the university and St. FrancisHospital and Medical Center in Hartford has shown that the bears canhelp regulate breathing by inducing deep, quiet sleep in preemies,who frequently suffer respiratory disorders, said Evelyn Thoman, thebehaviorist who designed the project.   ``This is a stimulation that I call biologically relevant,''Thoman said in a recent interview. ``It's sort of like having acompanion to sleep with. It's breathing, just like mummy and daddy.''   Thoman came up with the idea about 15 years ago and experimentedon rat pups deprived of their mothers. Those given a surrogatemother _ a warm, moist, pulsating tube _ survived. Those without asurrogate died.   Premature infants were a natural subject for the study, sincethey too are separated from their mothers when they are isolated inan incubator.   It took Thoman years to come up with the design for the bear _commercially made ones have protruding snouts and limbs that keepinfants at a distance _ and a pump that could duplicate the gentlerhythm of human breathing.   Harvard Apparatus Inc. of South Natick, Mass., developed the pump.   After some preliminary work, she got a $500,000 grant from theNational Institute of Child Health ahd Human Develpment for athree-year study that runs until May. Thoman and her researchassistants monitor how the babies respond to the bears throughtime-lapse photography.   The experiment is based partly on the physics principle ofentrainment, which holds that all pulsating or beating objects,animate and inanimate, tend to match the rhythms of nearby objects.   The phenomenon explains why a half-dozen grandfather clocks onthe same wall, all beating at different tempos, eventually willsynchronize. In people, it means the various body rhythms _ sleeppatterns, temperature, breathing, heartbeat _ influence each other,Thoman said.   Thoman theorizes that the bears may calm colicky babies, and thataside from helping infants learn to breathe the bears stimulatebrain development by letting the babies choose when to snuggle up tothe toys.   Doctors have known for years that underdeveloped, prematureinfants, isolated in an incubator away from their mothers and theoutside world, need stimulation to thrive. But the stimulation usedfor years has been passive and inescapable: the incessant sound ofan electrical heart implanted in a stuffed animal, the rising andfalling of a breathing air mattress.   The babies in the experiment snuggle with their bears about halfthe time, and move away by themselves the rest of the time.   Thoman's bears have been mentioned in writings on sudden infantdeath syndrome, but she cautions that it's far too early to theorizethat a device that helps regulate breathing will help prevent themysterious killer of apparently healthy babies.   ``We have demonstrated the bear facilitates maturation and thatit helps the babies breathe more regularly,'' she said. ``There is alogical jump to say, `Shouldn't (that) help prevent SIDS?' And in mywildest dreams, I would hope so. But that's too far away, there istoo much research to be done.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 15</NOTE></DOC>
