Defenders of Wildlife said it sent a letter to Bush urging himto direct Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan to impose an immediateivory trading ban and to provide money and equipment loans to theAfrican nations most affected by such a ban.   In the letter, Rupert Cutler, president of the group, said anestimated 300 African elephants a day are killed by poachers, arate he said ``will practically guarantee'' the extinction of theelephant by the end of the century.   Lujan last week said he told U.S. representatives to aninternational conference next October to push for increasedprotection of the African elephant.   He said the United States at the meeting will urge that theelephant be placed in a more protected classification under theinternational endangered species treaty, thereby prohibiting any ofthe 101 treaty nations from engaging in the commercial trading ofivory.   Lujan said he had instructed department officials to recommendwhether to change the African elephant's classification from``threatened'' to ``endangered'' under the U.S. endangered specieslaw.   Last year the United States imported $32 million worth of ivory,most of which originated with the African elephant.</TEXT></DOC>
