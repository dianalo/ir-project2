Since late 1985, only the Japanese and Ford Motor Co. haveincreased their shares of the U.S. car market.   General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp. and European automakerslost a share of the market, which itself decreased by 10.1 percentto about 9.2 million cars on Nov. 30.   ``I think their market share will continue to erode over thenext decade,'' said auto analyst Mary O'Neill of Duff andamp; Phelps Inc.in Chicago. ``Non-U.S. producers have about 30 percent market share.   ``It could go up to 40 (percent) in the next five years. Inaddition, the Japanese imports haven't fallen as much as peoplehave expected.''   At the end of November 1985, GM commanded 42.7 percent of theU.S. car market, a level that fell to 35 percent at the end of lastmonth. Chrysler had 11.3 percent back then and 10.4 percent at theend of last month.   Ford boosted its share to 22.3 percent from 18.9 percent andvehicles built by Japanese companies cornered 25.8 percent of themarket last month, compared with 21.3 percent four years earlier.   The so-called ``transplants'' lifted the Japanese automakers'shares. Without them, market share for the Japanese companies fellto 18.1 percent last month from 19.7 percent in 1985.   The Japanese transplants' rise to 7.7 percent of the market lastmonth from 1.7 percent four years ago prompted United Auto Workersunion President Owen Bieber to renew a call for export restraintsfrom the government in Tokyo.   In a letter this week to Trade Minister Hikaru Matsunaga, theleader of the 1-million-member UAW urged the Japanese government toslash vehicle exports to 1.5 million units in 1990 from the current2.3 million.   Bieber said such a reduction ``would demonstrate the governmentof Japan's commitment to reducing the bilateral trade imbalance andto replacing high levels of auto imports into the U.S. withvehicles produced here.''   The current export levels under the Japanese voluntary restraintagreement come up for annual review next March.   Spokesmen for Toyota, Nissan, Honda and Mazda, each of whom haveassembly plants in the United States, said Thursday it was tooearly to tell for sure if they would meet restraint levels thisyear.   However, officials for Toyota, Nissan and Mazda said it wasunlikely that the quotas would be met.   The main reason for that is production at their U.S. plants.   Back in 1985, the only Japanese companies with U.S. factorieswere Honda, with a plant in Marysville, Ohio; and Nissan, with aplant in Smyrna, Tenn. Since then, Honda has added a plant in EastLiberty, Ohio, and Nissan announced an expansion of the Smyrnaplant that will boost production to about 440,000 vehicles a yearby 1992.   Meantime, Toyota set up its own plant in Georgetown, Ky.; Mazdaestablished a plant in Flat Rock, Mich.; Toyota and GM are in ajoint venture in Fremont, Calif.; Mitsubishi and Chrysler aremaking cars in Normal, Ill.; and two Japanese automakers _ Subaruand Isuzu _ are making vehicles in Lafayette, Ind.   The UAW has organized Mazda's and the GM-Toyota andMitsubishi-Chrysler joint venture plants.</TEXT></DOC>
