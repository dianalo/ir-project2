The airline also said it plans to expand its U.S.-U.K.service this summer by 6% over last summer.                                                                                                          SPAIN INCREASES MINIMUM WAGE                                                                                                          Spain is increasing its minimum wage by 6.5% to 1,775pesetas ($18.40) a day. The Labor Ministry said the increasewas based on inflation estimates as well as consultationswith business and labor leaders. The government forecast thatinflation would be around 5% in 1991, compared with 6.7% asof Dec. 1, 1990. Unions said the increase wasn't sufficientto enable workers to regain purchasing power lost in recentyears.                                                                                                          CRISIS IN ZIMBABWE                                                                                                          Thousands of people in Zimbabwe are facing famine becauseof a shortage of vehicles to transport relief supplies, aidagencies say. The government, which lacks foreign exchangefor new vehicles and spare parts, says about two millionpeople are in urgent need of food in five of the country'seight provinces. Aid agencies say the government hasn't doneenough to improve the movement of food to drought-strickenareas. &quot;It is unforgivable for anybody to die of hunger herebecause we have such a huge food surplus,&quot; said oneaid-agency official.                                                                                                          PENALIZING JAPANESE CARTELS                                                                                                          Japan's Fair Trade Commission decided to raise penaltiesfor forming illegal cartels. The commission plans to work outlegislation and, after obtaining cabinet approval, submit itto parliament. Under the revised rules, the fine for illegalcartels would be set at the maximum of 6% of sales during thelife of cartels for major industries; at present, the penaltyis 1.5%. Retailers and wholesalers also face increasedpenalties, but in no cases would they have to pay more than2%. Japan has been under pressure from Washington to enforceanti-monopoly measures more strictly.                                                                                                          WESTERN GERMANY'S STASI AGENTS                                                                                                          Two thousand agents of the former East German Stasisecurity police are still living undetected in westernGermany, according to a member of the citizens' committeethat helped disband the organization. Ralf Merkel told ADNnews agency only a handful of agents had quit their posts andreturned to East Germany before unification last October.Those still in western Germany had jobs in politics andindustry, Mr. Merkel said; they were no longer active butrefused to come into the open unless an amnesty was agreed.                                                                                                          SOVIET SEMINAR                                                                                                          The Soviet Union will hold a three-day seminar startingMarch 12 in Tokyo to unveil its military and aerospacetechnology for the first time in Japan, a Japanese newsagency reported. Quoting the Japan-Soviet BusinessCooperation Committee, the agency said the Soviet Unionexpects to increase foreign-currency reserves by selling someof its advanced technology to Japanese companies. The seminarwill reportedly cover expertise in the fields of the arms,aerospace, biotechnology and electronics industries.                                                                                                          HOTEL TROUBLES IN HONG KONG                                                                                                          A Hong Kong hotel official said the lodging industry inthe British colony could face serious difficulties if thegovernment doesn't provide stronger backing.   C.W. Lui, chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong HotelOwners, warned that quality standards and profitability couldcome under strong pressure if a more active stance isn'tadopted by government officials. Profits have already beenhard hit over the last 18 months amid surging labor costs, ahotel construction boom and weak tourism.   Noting that the number of local hotels is set to hit 100by 1993, compared with 75 last year, Mr. Lui said thegovernment should do more to develop tourist sites and workharder to ensure that the planned new airport is constructedas soon as possible.   Mr. Lui also asked that the government push harder toestablish hotel-studies programs at local universities andprovide better police protection. Hong Kong has suffered asharp rise in crime in recent months.
