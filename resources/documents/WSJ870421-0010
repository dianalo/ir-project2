Lenders last week were asking, on average, a 10.27% interest rate on 30-year, conventional fixed-rate mortgages, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. That was sharply higher than the 9.43% rate the week before, and up from 9.92% a year earlier. Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.    Last week was the first time since October that mortgage rates have risen beyond 10%, according to the government-sponsored agency known as Freddie Mac. Last October, mortgage rates took a brief upturn after a decline through most of the spring and summer that set off a nationwide avalanche of home buying and refinancing. Rates have fallen almost continuously since then, reaching a nine-year low in March.    That trend stopped abruptly in the week ended April 10, when rates jumped almost a quarter of a percentage point in reaction to the prime rate increase, the falling dollar and general nervousness in the capital markets. Analysts attributed last week's rate increase to many of the same factors, but many said rates are likely to fall back in a few weeks.    &quot;Although the U.S. average interest rate . . . jumped 84 basis points, this rate should slip back about half a percentage point within the next few weeks&quot; along with other interest rates, said Michael Lea, chief economist for Freddie Mac. &quot;The economy appears too sluggish to warrant the current high level of interest rates.&quot;    &quot;This is a bump,&quot; agreed John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. &quot;We may be seeing rates at a new plateau, and they may move 40 to 50 basis points around a higher average than previously. But I do not, by any means, see any justification for the higher rates.&quot;    A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point; 100 basis points equal 1%.    These and other analysts agreed that the current volatility in home loan rates stems in part from the growth in the secondary mortgage market, and its increasing interdependence with other capital markets.    &quot;We've created synthetic mortgage instruments that look an awful lot like corporate bonds and Treasury debt securities and appeal to the same crowd of investors,&quot; Mr. Tuccillo said. &quot;Under these circumstances, you've got to expect that they'll start to vibrate with the bond market.&quot;    Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said, &quot;We think the markets have overreacted and are too much keyed to the foreign exchange markets,&quot; particularly in recent weeks. &quot;I realize we're fighting a strong breeze here, but we think the mortgage markets should retrace their steps over the past 10 days and start bringing the rates back down,&quot; he said.    Despite the sharp rise in fixed-rate loans, adjustable-rate loans have remained relatively low, according to the Freddie Mac survey. Lenders last week were asking 7.67%, on average, for the first year of conventional, Treasury-indexed, 30-year adjustable-rate mortgages. The rate was up from 7.52% the previous week, but was well below the 8.50% rate of a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
