Yesterday's news brought relief to investors who havespent considerable time lately fretting over the U.S. economyand corporate profits.</LP><TEXT>   The Nasdaq Composite Index added to its gains throughoutthe session, closing with a gain of 8.55 to 499.31, justbelow its best level of the day and at an all-time closinghigh.   Advancing issues led decliners, 1,211 to 710, whileNational Market System volume totaled 136,723,000 shares, upfrom Wednesday's 123,831,200.   The Labor Department's report yesterday morning thatproducer prices had fallen 0.3% in March helped set the tonefor the day. The price level was expected to be unchanged.   Investors have felt that if inflation appears to be incheck, the Federal Reserve Board will move to ease interestrates.   But equally important to the Nasdaq market was ahigher-than-expected earnings report from Intel. That stockleapt 4 1/2, or 9.5%, to 52, just below its 52-week high of52 3/4.   And many of the other major OTC technology issues alsoadvanced. Apple Computer gained 4 1/8 to 71, LotusDevelopment added 1 3/4 to 27 3/4, Microsoft gained 3 1/2 to111 and Sun Microsystems added 2 to 35.   Intel posted first-quarter net income of 95 cents a share,up from 73 cents in the year-ago period. Analysts surveyed byZacks Investment Research had expected the company to earnbetween 78 cents and 87 cents in the latest quarter.   &quot;It's still one of the most misunderstood stocks on theStreet. People still don't understand the earnings power ofthis company,&quot; said Andrew Kessler, an analyst at MorganStanley andamp; Co. He sees the company's profit continuing tobuild as it derives more and more of its revenue from itshigh-margin 486 microchip.   Mr. Kessler expects the company to earn $4 a share in 1991and $4.80 in 1992. He sees the stock trading around 65 overthe next 12 months &quot;and beyond that over the next two years.&quot;   But yesterday's report on producer prices is only half ofthe inflation picture; this morning the government willrelease its figures for March prices at the consumer level.   The Nasdaq market today is &quot;going to key off what the(consumer price) index numbers are,&quot; said Nelson Gold, seniorvice president of OTC trading at Interstate-Johnson LaneCorp.   If the numbers show stronger-than-expected price increasesand the Federal Reserve appears unable to ease rates, traderssaid, share prices will fall. The market will rise onfavorable inflation news, but traders say that some of thatgain may already be reflected in the market in anticipationof good news.   State Street Boston jumped 4 1/8 to 49 1/8 after postingfirst-quarter net of $1.55 a share, up from 75 cents lastyear.

Thecompany said its cash flow will increase by 10% to 12% a yearover the next five years, compared with 14% to 16% increasesin the recent past. But it said debt will fall to 2.7 timescash flow in 1995 from six times cash flow in 1991.   3Com ended unchanged at 9 on volume of 179,400 shares. Thecompany will retain its work group division, which it hadconsidered selling. The group designs and manufacturesnetwork servers, workstations and software.

Mr. Hardiman also challenged the New York and Americanstock exchanges to embrace greater automation of securitiestrading or else fall behind fast-paced innovations beingdeveloped around the world. In a speech to the New YorkFinancial Writers Association, he called for greaterregulatory flexibility so U.S. stock markets don't loseAmerican companies to overseas markets where corporationscould raise capital at lower costs. New futures, options andother hybrid securities products originated by U.S. firmsalso could increasingly move overseas, he warned, without newregulation.   A plan to strengthen net capital and other requirementsfor stocks trading on Nasdaq should be approved later thismonth by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Hardimansaid in an interview. About 200 to 300 small companies areexpected to be dropped from Nasdaq because they won't be ableto meet the stricter requirements, but Mr. Hardiman said heexpects many of those will recapitalize to meet the newrequirements.   SelectNet, Nasdaq's new limit-order matching service, hasrecently introduced order-driven features into Nasdaq'strading capability, he added. Introduced last fall, SelectNetinitially took a &quot;big bite&quot; out of the brokerage business ofcompetitor Instinet Inc., a unit of Reuters Holdings PLC,Instinet's chief executive officer, Michael O. Sanderson,said in a telephone interview. However, Mr. Sanderson saidthat Instinet has regained about 75% of the business it lostto the new Nasdaq system.</TEXT></DOC>
