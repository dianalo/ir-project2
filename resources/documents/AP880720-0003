Dream of teachers,but teachers who will teach for life, not just for a living. Dreamof doctors, but doctors who are more concerned with public healththan personal wealth. Dream of lawyers, but lawyers who are moreconcerned with justice than a judgeship. Dream of artists, butartists who will convey music and message, rhythm, and reason.   Dream of priests and preachers, but priests and preachers whowill prophesy and not profiteer. Dream of authentic leaders whowill mold public opinion against a headwind, not just ride thetailwinds of opinion polls. Dream of a world where we measurecharacter by how much we share and care, not by how much we takeand consume.   America must never surrender to a high moral challenge.   America must never surrender to drugs. No first use is ourpolicy; clinics for those who are sick. Not free needles andcynicism. Never surrender, go forward.   America must never surrender to malnutrition. We can feed thehungry and clothe the poor. We will never surrender, we will goforward.   America must never surrender to illiteracy. We will invest inour children. Never surrender, go forward.   America must never surrender to inequality. Women deservecomparable and pay equity. Women make 60 cents of every dollar aman makes. Yet they can't buy bread cheaper, they can't buy homescheaper. Women deserve comparable worth and pay equity.   Our nation will never surrender to AIDS. People with AIDSdeserve our compassion, but they deserve more than that. Theydeserve resources for research, expedited approval of drugs, acoordinated offensive to stop AIDS now.   Those in your wheelchairs, don't surrender. I know that peoplelook down upon you. They try to break your spirit. But stay tall inyour chairs. You are measured by the size of your character, notthe height of your reach. Remember when this nation was down, weturned to Franklin Roosevelt, who could not stand on his legs, toput the nation back on its feet. I tell you this _ I would ratherhave Roosevelt in a wheelchair than Reagan on a horse.   Never surrender, move forward.   My work to keep America strong and make America better isancient and endless.   We can win. When I stand here tonight, it has a meaning forthose who are down, those who are tired or bent. Don't give up.Hold on, for the morning comes. You can make it if you try. Holdon, the morning comes. How do I know?</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
