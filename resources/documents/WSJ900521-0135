The bluff, 74-year-old tycoon who stunned the world artmarket last week by paying $160.6 million for two paintingsexpects criticism for his extravagance. But the prospectdoesn't seem to bother him. &quot;It's my policy to get what Iwant, no matter how much money I have to pile up,&quot; he boastedto Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper. &quot;Both were wonderfulpaintings, and once it's in an auction, somebody's going toget it. I thought . . . that I'd be the one.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Even paying $33 million more than he expected last Tuesdayto acquire Vincent van Gogh's haunting &quot;Portrait of Dr.Gachet&quot; for a record $82.5 million didn't deter Mr. Saitofrom spending another $78.1 million two days later for PierreAuguste Renoir's bright &quot;Au Moulin de la Galette.&quot;   But Mr. Saito's generosity last week with the New Yorkauction houses, where he was represented by Tokyo's KobayashiGallery -- is a trait that has caused him trouble in thepast.   Local magazines dub him &quot;the wild man of Tokai,&quot; hisregion of Japan, for the tyrannical way he's run the familybusiness, Daishowa Paper Manufacturing Co., Japan'ssecond-biggest paper concern.   He packed the company's board with relatives. He installedtwo of his brothers as company president, and fired one ofthem. Four of his sons have worked at the company. He isaccused by critics of treating the company's money as hisown; even today, Daishowa officials say they don't know ifMr. Saito, now chairman emeritus, used his own money orcompany money to buy the paintings in New York. (Mr. Saitotells reporters that he borrowed the money against his landholdings.)   So aggressive was Mr. Saito with Daishowa's money a decadeago that he temporarily lost control of the company. After aferocious investment binge bloated the company's debt,Daishowa was forced to cede some management control to itsbiggest bank, Sumitomo Bank Ltd., in 1982. Mr. Saito even wasforced by the bank to sell off an earlier art collection andother assets valued at more than $1 billion. After thecompany's finances stabilized in 1983, Mr. Saito resumedcontrol -- and says he severed ties with Sumitomo. Sumitomoofficials were unavailable for comment over the weekend, butthe bank still holds a 4.1% stake in Daishowa.   Mr. Saito has splashed his wealth around before. He is thechief benefactor of the public art museum in Shizuoka, hishome prefecture. He has fed speculation that the museum willhouse his newly acquired works, although he says thefacilities may need to be improved to house world-class art.But officials at the museum, which has about 80 Westernpaintings, most of them small works, as well as about 1,200Japanese paintings and some sculptures, were cautious, sayingthey hadn't yet been offered the paintings officially.   Every year when he pays his national income taxes, Mr.Saito breaks into the top 50 taxpayers in the land. He sayshe's proud to be on the list so people will know howsuccessful he has been.   With the acquisition of the world's two most-expensivepaintings, he knows he's flaunting his wealth in a sensitivearea. Foreign reaction has been sharp toward Japanesepurchases of Western cultural symbols.   Nevertheless, Mr. Saito told the Associated Press, &quot;I'mnot concerned, because this is all one big world.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
