To evaluate their present economic merits, a life cycle costanalysis comparing them with competing conventional water heaters iscarried out. Their market prospects between 1985 and 2000 are assessedby defining two limiting scenarios which encompass all reasonably conceivablepaths of market development. The results show that the demand is carriedessentially by urban regions. New towns currently under constructionor in the planning phase, for which the installation of DSWHs has beenmade mandatory, account for nearly half of the total urban demand. Therange of concomitant annual savings in commercial primary energies iscalculated.</TEXT></DOC>
