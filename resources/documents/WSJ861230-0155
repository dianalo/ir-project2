The maker of telephones for residential markets, which went public in March, also said it expected to break even or post a &quot;modest&quot; loss for all of 1986, on sales of about $25 million.    In the first nine months of this year, TeleQuest had net income of $344,000, or 10 cents a share, on sales of $15.7 million. In all of 1985, it earned $1.7 million on sales of $17.8 million.    Robert E. Lee, TeleQuest's president and chief executive officer, attributed the lower sales to late delivery of its products, increased use of air freight and sluggishness of Christmas sales. The fourth quarter generally contributes about 50% of annual sales and 60% of annual earnings, he said.    Mr. Lee said, however, that the company believes it won't require additional financing in 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
