The idea, which was discussed in two days of talks herebetween Secretary of State James Baker and top Russianofficials, forms part of the agenda that the two nationsagreed to work on speedily in preparation for a summitmeeting this summer. During the next few months, they alsowill discuss deep cuts that have been proposed in long-rangenuclear missiles, further U.S. technical assistance to helpthe former Soviet Union dismantle much of its nuclear arsenaland additional economic aid to bolster Russia's economicreform efforts.</LP><TEXT>   At a news conference yesterday, Mr. Baker and RussianForeign Minister Andrei Kozyrev stressed that their nationsare concerned mainly with removing debris from the Cold Warnow that they have moved away from their former adversarialrelationship. Concerning arms control issues, &quot;both sidesshare politically the same view, but both sides, at the sametime, are facing some technical difficulties,&quot; Mr. Kozyrevsaid. &quot;I think that is the same answer that I would giveyou,&quot; Mr. Baker responded.   The early-warning ballistic missile center, Mr. Bakerexplained, would use various technologies and draw onresources such as satellites to &quot;integrate and displayballistic missile early-warning information forparticipants.&quot; A U.S. official said that in addition to theU.S. and Russia, other former Soviet republics, members ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization and East Europeannations could plug into such a system at the outset.   The U.S. official said that Russian officials are&quot;extremely enthusiastic&quot; about the joint project, which couldprovide some measure of security amid worsening missileproliferation. Russia would be more vulnerable to missileattacks than the U.S. because it would be within range ofpotentially hostile states near its border, the officialsaid.   Despite talk about cooperation, there will be hardbargaining ahead between the U.S. and Russia on reducingoffensive nuclear weapons. At yesterday's session, the twonations made little progress in closing the gap between theirseparate proposals for reducing long-range arms. Both sidesfavor going beyond reductions they agreed upon last year.President Bush has suggested cutting each side's strategicnuclear arsenals to about 4,500 warheads; Russian PresidentBoris Yeltsin wants to cut back to about 2,500 nuclearwarheads each.   The overall level would have important implications forthe mix of missiles on each side. President Bush's proposalwould eliminate multi-warhead, land-based missiles, forcingthe Russians to make deep cuts in the backbone of theirnuclear arsenal. Mr. Yeltsin's lower figure would force theU.S. to cut more deeply than it would like intosubmarine-based missiles, where it currently has anadvantage.   Mr. Baker shot down a Russian proposal that the two sidesstop targeting their long-range missiles at each other. Mr.Yeltsin several weeks ago pledged to do just that. But ratherthan reciprocate, Mr. Baker said yesterday that Mr. Yeltsinnow agrees with him that compliance with such an arrangementcouldn't be verified and that any re-targeting could bereversed very quickly. &quot;I told him that I support the spiritof the proposal as a future goal,&quot; Mr. Baker said.   Messrs. Baker and Kozyrev said both nations have agreed tostreamline and accelerate the negotiating process. The formerSoviet Union needs to cut the costs of maintaining its vastmilitary machine quickly. The U.S. would like to lock inagreements as soon as possible, since it's unclear how longdemocratic reformers will remain in office in the formerSoviet Union. But the U.S. also recognizes that it must beflexible despite Russia's current weakness; otherwise, Mr.Yeltsin may encounter resistance to a new arms-reduction pactfrom his resentful military.   &quot;We have decided to forego protracted negotiations, whichsometimes only substituted for decision-making,&quot; Mr. Kozyrevsaid. And Mr. Baker said, &quot;Hopefully, we are beyond the pointof having to sit down with huge numbers (of specialists) oneach side of the table and spend endless months and yearshaggling about the tiniest little details.&quot;   Separately, the top military leader of the commonwealth offormer Soviet republics conceded that the republics' unifiedarmy is doomed to fall apart.   &quot;In the end, our army will split into national armies,&quot;Marshall Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, commander in chief of thejoint armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States,told reporters.   The issue of republican armies has been especiallydivisive. At a commonwealth summit last week in Minsk,Belarus, only eight of the 11 member states agreed to form ajoint force to assume the conventional-warfare tasks of theformer Soviet Union's Red Army. Ukraine, Moldova andAzerbaijian, which want to maintain separate armies, refusedto sign the pact.   ---   Adi Ignatius contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
