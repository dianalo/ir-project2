Bush extolled what ``President Reagan and I'' have accomplishedsince taking office in 1981.   The vice president, who will formally win the Republicanpresidential nomination two weeks from Wednesday at the party'snational convention, pledged to pursue arms control negotiationswith the Soviet Union _ but warily. In keeping with his recentslightly skeptical statements about Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev's reform drive, he said Russia should be judged by ``whatit delivers'' in arms reductions, human rights, immigration andeasing of tensions around the globe.   The vice president also took time in his foreign policy speechto express satisfaction with Reagan's decision to permit plantclosing legislation to become law without his signature. ``I thinkthe president made a good decision, and that matter is now resolvedand now we can get the focus where it belongs, on plant openings,''Bush said.   Dukakis campaigned extensively against an earlier Reagan veto ofa trade bill that contained the same provision to require 60 days'notice to employees before a plant is closed.   The vice president didn't mention that issue in his speech, nordid he discuss his search for a vice presidential running mate. Onthe latter subject, Fuller said only that the list of possiblecandidates had been narrowed somewhat in recent days.   Bush suggested that development of the administration'sStrategic Defense Initiative, also known as ``Star Wars,'' might becritical to Israel's security. In a remark that seemed to open up anew argument for the system as well as a challenge Dukakis, hesaid, ``It is one thing to say you are committed to Israel'ssecurity, but in an age of ballistic missiles, if you are againstdefensive systems such as SDI, that slogan has little meaning.''   Aides said the vice president was likely to deal more harshlywith Dukakis in a second speech, perhaps as early as Thursday inTexas.   In Boston, the national issues director for the Dukakis campaignquestioned Bush's logic in the SDI-Israel statement.   ``The point makes no sense whatsoever,'' said Christopher Edley,Jr. ``Israel's security is no more an important argument for SDIthan water quality or auto safety is an argument for SDI.''   ``If the vice president wants to discuss the merits of thepresident's space boondoggle he should explain how SDI isconsistent with the ABM treaty, how the system would work given theunanimous scientific community agreement that it is unworkable andhow billions more wasted on SDI will give us a stronger America,''Edley said.   The vice president said Reagan and he have worked successfullyto restore American leadership and have ``repaired our nation'sdefenses, modernized our strategic nuclear forces, deployedintermediate nuclear forces in Europe and restored pride in ournation's military services.''   As for the future, Bush said he would continue to modernize theAmerican nuclear force ``as we pursue a verifiable and stabilizingagreement'' for a 50 percent cut in U.S. and Soviet arsenals. Healso called for a reduction in conventional forces in Europe.   He blamed Democrats in Congress for dragging their feet on StarWars. ``I am committed to deployment of SDI as soon as feasible andwill determine the exact architecture of the system in my firstterm, as the technologies are tested and proven,'' he said. ``Aspresident I will not leave America defenseless against ballisticmissiles.''   Bush called a $299.5 billion Pentagon budget-authorization billapproved by Congress last month ``a bad bill'' and said Reaganshould veto it.   Congressional Republicans likewise have urged a veto because thebill, though giving Reagan what he sought for the overall defensebudget, sharply reduces the White House request for Star Warsspending and also includes arms control policy restrictions opposedby the administration.   Bush said he would work to increase the ``scope and momentum ofthe democratic revolution'' around the world.   ``We must support genuine freedom fighters and assist fledglingdemocrats,'' he said. He made no mention of the Contra rebelsfighting the Nicaraguan government and cited no other examples.   He also said he would try to stop the spread of ballisticmissiles around the world.   The vice president said he would place one senior official incharge of the U.S. ballistic missile program and give him theoverall responsibility for the ``intelligence, military, technical,diplomatic and economic resources needed to respond.''   Bush also said he would combat drugs internationally and seekelimination of trade barriers around the world.   Bush later returned to Washington and addressed 200 people at arally of ethnic leaders supporting his candidacy. He told theBush-88 Coalition of American Nationalities, ``I can speak ourlanguage of ethnic values and pride, everlasting pride in theUnited States of America.''   Acknowledging his own ``WASP'' background, Bush said many ethnicAmericans are likely to share his support for voluntary prayer inpublic schools and the death penalty.</TEXT></DOC>
