Reilly and investigator Gary Lachman last week came across amurder warrant for Robert Lee Mitchell in the shooting of hisformer girlfriend, Billie Marie Redmon Phillips, in Dallas in 1960.   As the detectives do routinely, they asked for an informationsheet on Mitchell from the FBI, which categorizes every personarrested by fingerprints and not by name. When the detectivesreceived the file on Mitchell, it included a 1985 arrest of a mannamed Billy Jackson on an assault charge in Chicago.   Chicago police furnished a phone number for the man.   ``We called and said we were doing a survey,'' Reilly said. ``Italked to his wife. She gave me his name. She confirmed they livedat the same address. She even confirmed that he was in the otherroom reading the paper.''   FBI agents arrested Jackson, formerly Mitchell, in his bathtubon Friday, Lachman said.   ``He was surprised he was arrested,'' Reilly said. ``He didn'tdeny he was the same person.''   Mitchell had fled after the slaying. Relatives later said he haddied, and the FBI closed the case in 1980, sheriff's detectivessaid.   But the detectives knew Mitchell was still alive because hisSocial Security number was still active and no one had claimeddeath benefits on it.</TEXT></DOC>
