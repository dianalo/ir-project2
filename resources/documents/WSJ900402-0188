The so-called &quot;Brady Bill,&quot; however, would not havestopped Hinckley's attack on President Reagan, and if itbecomes law it will not stop future assassins or othergun-toting criminals. Despite your claims, Mr. Brady bringsno &quot;new dimension&quot; to the highly polarized debate on guncontrol. Emotion has long been an ally of the falsehoods anddistortions that are the stock and trade of Mr. Brady'swife's group, Handgun Control Inc.</LP><TEXT>   Gun-control schemes promoted by people ignorant about andhostile to firearms may enjoy better prospects of passagetoday than in the past, but they enjoy no greater chance ofaffecting criminal violence. To develop regulations thatreally would have an effect, lawmakers need to avoid thebattle between the NRA and HCI by seeking the support andcollaboration of honest gun owners for restrictions thatrespect their own rights while targeting those who criminallymisuse firearms. The NRA and its membership would rallybehind such efforts, but they would not satisfy theself-righteousness and cultural bigotry of the HCI crusaders.   Lee Warren Smith   Los Angeles   ---   You say many U.S.-made assault weapons are exported todrug lords in Colombia and elsewhere. The drug lords, infact, are not interested in U.S.-made semiautomatic arms, butprefer full automatic weapons, which they easily purchasefrom many sources in Europe and Asia or occasionally stealfrom local police and military forces. I've spent much timein these areas on legitimate business and am not speakingfrom secondhand knowledge.   This &quot;Colombian drug lord&quot; gambit is simply the latest ofa long line of cliches foisted on the public by thegun-control crowd to achieve its purposes.   Robert L. Humphrey   Los Angeles   ---   While the NRA is a very efficient lobby in Congress, it issecond to none in its ability to inform its members of anyattempt to weaken constitutional rights. Not only does itinform its members, but through media attention brought toits tactics it also informs the public at large and allowscitizens to consider both sides of the issue before votingtheir convictions. The politicians know this. They also knowit is rarely beneficial to be on the side of an issuesupported by the minority opinion.   Mitchael Cromeens   Minerals Wells, Texas</TEXT></DOC>
