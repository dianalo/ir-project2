Coastal and shelf Holocene Sediments provide the only long-termrecord of such climatic events. Normal slow sedimentation is punctuatedby storm deposits of concentrated shell debris and sand. In order tointerpret storm-generated shell beds however, they must be distinguishedfrom other types of shell accumulations. Diagnostic parameters includethe degree of shell abrasion, breakage and dissolution; shell orientation,size-frequency plots, and faunal mixing; and occurrence of sedimentaryfeatures such as scour surfaces, graded bedding, escape burrows, andhummocky cross-stratification. These parameters have been effective indistinguishing different types of shell layers in sediment cores fromdeposits produced by Hurricane Alicia (August, 1983) at San Luis Pass,Texas, and in cores from the Texas shelf and in Texas bays. Preservationpotential of these deposits in different environments is a function ofnormal rates of deposition, sediment reworking and shell dissolution,and of extent of scour by succeeding storms. Core data must sample therange of storm events: quiescent bay environments provide a record ofminor, seasonal storms; the inner shelf records hurricane activity; themost severe storms may be recorded in tidal inlets and further offshore.Age dating of these deposits provides an absolute time scale for predictingranked storm frequency.</TEXT></DOC>
