Wolf said Wednesday's order, the largest ever to a singleaircraft manufacturer, primarily reflects United's commitment toexpand its fleet and regain the title of America's largest airline.   But United also will replace some of its aging planes, he said.The Chicago-based airline has one of the oldest fleets in theindustry, with an average age of 13.5 years.   Although Wolf said airplanes will fly ``forever'' if maintainedproperly, the decision to replace some United jets was ``motivatedby two things: the cost of maintaining older aircraft and publicperception of older aircraft.''   ``Some things have happened of late to focus the consumer andfocus Congress on the issue of aging aircraft,'' Wolf said. ``Butin terms of that being a prod, this is a business decision we wereflowing toward anyway.''   Among the recent incidents focusing attention on aging aircraftwas a Feb. 24 accident in Hawaii involving a United Boeing 747. Theforward cargo door and part of the fuselage tore off shortly afterthe plane left Honolulu, killing nine passengers.   The National Transportation Safety Board finished a second dayof hearings into that accident Tuesday in Seattle, but officials ofUnited and Boeing said the timing of their announcement was purelycoincidental.   The package includes firm orders for 180 Boeing jetliners andoptions on 190 others.   United's order came just one week after Ireland's GPA GroupLtd., an aircraft leasing firm, ordered $17 billion in jets fromBoeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Europe's Airbus Industrie.   In another coup for Boeing, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said todayit plans to spend around 2 billion Dutch guilders, or $940 million,to buy five new Boeing 747-400s and ten new 737s. KLM said thepurchases are part of a program to standardize the type of planesit flies.   United is the nation's second-largest carrier, behind AmericanAirlines. During the first quarter of 1989, American flew 16.89percent of the total domestic revenue passenger miles to United's16.73 percent.   United's order includes firm plans for 120 twin-engine Boeing737s and 60 narrow-body 757s, plus options on 130 737s and 60 757s.   United said it has ordered engines from CFM International, apartnership of General Electric Co. and the French jet-engine makerSNECMA, for the 737 jetliners. The order is potentially worth $2billion, CFM officials said.   The 757s will be powered by Pratt andamp; Whitney engines with apotential total value of $1.4 billion.   United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker said the engine costs wereincluded in United's $15.7 billion estimate for the entire package.   It had been known for six months that United, a subsidiary ofUAL Corp., was preparing a large order for 737s and 757s. But theairline wanted to hold off ordering while it tried to get contractconcessions from its pilots and flight attendants unions.   The airline is still negotiating with those workers but has comeunder increasing pressure to buy planes and lock in deliverypositions because its competitors _ including American, Delta AirLines and Trans World Airlines _ have placed orders in recentmonths.   ``I guess they've decided to go ahead and show their goodfaith'' to the unions, said Louis Marckesano, an analyst whofollows airlines for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.   He said the size of the order was a surprise but ``it's what'sneeded to maintain their growth and their position in the industryin the next 10 years.''</TEXT></DOC>
