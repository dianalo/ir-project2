(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   At most rodeos, the crowd cheers for thecowboy to stay atop the bucking bull. Bobby Rowe cheers for thebull.   Rowe lavishes love and kindness on his bulls in hopes that a fewwill grow into the ornery 1,500-pound rodeo demons that throw thetoughest cowboys.   Rowe, a former world champion saddle bronc rider, is looking fora commercial formula for raising bucking bulls on a farm nearDickson.   ``It's like you can take five men, give them a ditch to dig,tell them to do it and four of them won't get it done,'' Rowe said.``That's the same with bulls. Some buck and some won't. It's amatter of heart and attitude.''   Rowe raises the bulls on the 1,400-acre Highland Rim Farm, whichhe has operated for three years for owner Henry McCall.   Hooked on the rodeo since he was a teen-ager, Rowe has developedan eye for good bucking bulls over the years. The trainer firsttests the animals with mechanical riders and sends those thatcontinue bucking to Maury, Ky., to work out with a rodeo team.   After more tests at local events the best bulls travel thenational rodeo circuit.   ``That's the ones I like,'' Rowe said. ``I'm looking for thebest.''</TEXT><DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Unpack your parkas and pull out yourshovels _ the woolly bear caterpillars here are pointing to a long,cold, snowy winter.   Springfield highway chief Philip Pike, who presides over a$935,600 snow plowing budget, hauled out three woolly bearcaterpillars Tuesday and declared it's going to be touch and gowhether the city will have enough funds to clear the streets thiswinter.   Pike maintains that measuring the width of the orange stripe onthe caterpillars and the bushiness of squirel tails is as reliablea system as any for the annual municipal guessing game of how muchmoney to keep in the snow plowing accounts.   ``What the heck. We have some fun with it and I've got as good arecord as anyone,'' Pike said. Circumstances permitting, of course.Pike made no prediction last year because he couldn't find anycaterpillars.   On one of the three test caterpillars he unscientificallyscooped up last weekend, the orange band takes up nearly the wholebody. On the other two it is much larger than the brown.   The wider the orange, the more snow, he allowed. And thesquirrels in city parks have such bushy tails it's certain to becold as well, he contended.</TEXT><DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nick Ameli Sr., who has worked at theBluewell Fire Department for 40 years, apologizes that he isn't asactive a firefighter as he was some years ago.   Ameli is 83.   ``Mostly I direct traffic now and answer the phone. More often Imake sure the men have coffee and refreshments waiting when theyreturn to the station after a call,'' he said.   After 24 years as a miner, Ameli moved to Bluewell, where hebecame a firefighter. He was one of the founders of the VolunteerFire Department and after retirement became an equally busyvolunteer.   Today, he is proud of the three generations of Amelis who arevolunteer firefighters.   A plaque placed on the fire house honors Ameli for work he didon the building, which was completed in 1969.   ``They didn't have any money to pay me for the work so theplaque was put up,'' Ameli said. ``It will last longer than themoney would have anyway.''</TEXT></DOC>
