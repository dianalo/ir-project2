The Kings also got two goals from Luc Robitaille and single goalsfrom rookie defenseman Peter Ahola and centers Mike Donnelly and Randy Gilhen.Brian Mullen scored two goals for the Sharks, including one while the team waskilling a penalty, and Perry Anderson, Brian Lawton and Link Gaetz had theother goals.;   The Kings took a 6-2 lead when Kudelski scored his third goalof the game after 1 minute, 53 seconds had elapsed in the third period.Anderson and Lawton pulled the Sharks to within two goals with nearly 14minutes to play when they combined to score twice in a span of 2:17, but theKings (3-1-2) put the game out of reach when Robitaille was credited with hissecond goal at 13:36 of the third period.
