Test Rule Development Under TSCAThis document is part of the overall implementation of section 4 of TSCA(Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003 <T3>et seq.</T3>; 15 U.S.C. 2601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), which contains authority for EPA to require developmentof data relevant to assessing the risks to health and the environment posedby exposure to particular chemical substances or mixtures.Under section 4(a) of TSCA, EPA must require testing of a chemical substanceor mixture to develop appropriate health or environmental data if the Administratormakes certain findings as described in TSCA under section 4(a)(1) (A) or(B). Detailed discussions of the statutory section 4 findings are providedin the Agency's first and second proposed test rules which were publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 18, 1980 (45 FR 48524) and June 5, 1981(46 FR 30300).B. Regulatory HistoryAs published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 21, 1985 (50 FR 20930), the InteragencyTesting Committee (ITC) designated MCP for priority consideration for healtheffects testing, including neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, oncogenicity,genotoxicity, teratogenicity, and reproductive effects. The Agency respondedto the ITC's recommendations for MCP by publishing in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 15, 1986 (51 FR 17854) a proposed rulefor neurotoxicity (schedule-controlled operant behavior, neuropathology,functional observation battery, motor activity, and developmental neurotoxicityscreen), subchronic toxicity, and inhalation and dermal pharmacokinetics(absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) testing of MCP. TheAgency also proposed acute and subchronic toxicity, oncogenicity, reproductivetoxicity, developmental toxicity, mutagencity, neurotoxicity (schedule-controlledoperant behavior, neuropathology, functional observation battery, and motoractivity), and inhalation and dermal pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution,metabolism, and excertion) testing for commercial hexane. The proposalcontained information on chemical profiles, production, uses, human exposure,and health effects of MCP and commercial hexane; discussed ongoing testingof <T3>n</T3>-hexane and its metabolites; discussed EPA's TSCA section 4(a)findings; described the proposed tests, the test standards, and the testsubstances to be used; specified who would be required to conduct the proposedtesting; specified reporting requirements for data to be developed underthe rule; discussed enforcement provisions; and presented issues for comment.On June 27, 1986 (51 FR 23440), EPA published corrections to the proposedrule.Pursuant to a request by the American Petroleum Institute (API), EPA issueda notice (51 FR 26170; July 21, 1986) extending the comment period foran additional 60 days to September 15, 1986. API contended in its requestthat the composition of the commercial hexane identified in the proposedrule did not conform to the range of commercial hexanes in current productionand commerce. The extension of time was granted to allow additional timefor API and its member companies to develop a more representative definitionof commercial hexane and to assist in determining manufacturers and processorssubject to the rule. On October 7, 1986, EPA held a public meeting to hear and discuss oralcomments presented on various aspects of the proposed rule. The transcriptof this meeting is part of the rulemaking record. Most of the discussionat this meeting focussed on whether testing both MCP and commercial hexaneis necessary and on data submitted by API relating to the need for testingand the composition of the test substance.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Response to Public Comment</ITAG>Written comments were submitted on behalf of industries and trade associationsby the Exxon Co., U.S.A. (Exxon), the American Petroleum Institute (API),and the American Industrial Health Council (AIHC) and on behalf of publicinterest groups by the National Network to Prevent Birth Defects (NNPBD),the American Psychological Association (APA), and the Center for Sciencein the Public Interest (CSPI). These comments, as well as oral presentationsmade at the public meeting, dealt with the regulatory and legal authorityof the Agency to make TSCA section 4 findings, the scientific rationaleof the proposed testing, and the test methodologies. After the public meeting,the Agency, through its contractor, Syracuse Research Corp. (SRC), conducteda second literature review of commercial hexane. The Agency reevaluatedthese data and addressed all issues and comments, including additionalcomments submitted by API and APA after the close of the comment periodand the public meeting. These comments have been addressed at length ina document entitled ``Response to Public Comment on Methylcyclopentaneand Commercial Hexane'' and hereinafter called the ``technical supportdocument,'' which is part of the public record for this rulemaking (Ref.1). Because of the number and the complexity of the comments as well asthe length of the Agency's response to them, EPA is providing in this noticean overview of major concerns, a discussion of the issues raised in theproposed rule, and an explanation of changes in the final rule based onan analysis of the comments. The reader is referred to the technical supportdocument (Ref. 1) for a more detailed discussion.A. Overview of Industry's Major Comments and EPA's Response1. Comment: <T3>Data on commercial hexane for all endpoints are adequate. </T3>TheAgency requested comment on the availability of published and unpublishedstudies on commercial hexane A which would adequately describe its potentialto cause any of the effects for which EPA had proposed testing (refer tothe proposal for the definition of commercial hexane A, 51 FR 17864; May15, 1986). EPA had a specific interest in obtaining data on the proposedtest substance, commercial hexane A, because data (Ref. 2) available atthe time of the proposal indicated that this type of hexane was responsiblefor the largest amount of human exposures and contained the largest amountof MCP. API clarified this matter with additional information and addressedall types of commercial hexanes in its comments (Refs. 3, 4 and 5). Therefore,the Agency has been able to evaluate the availability of health effectsdata related to all types of commercial hexane, rather than a specifictype of commercial hexane.In response to the issue of the availability of studies to characterizecommercial hexane's health effects in humans, API (Ref. 3) and Exxon (Ref.6) contended that there were sufficient data on commercial hexane to characterizeall of the effects for which testing was proposed. They contended thatexisting studies of commercial hexane, mixtures of C<T2>6</T2> hydrocarbons, and individual components of commercial hexaneprovide adequate data from which to assess the potential health hazardsfrom exposure to commercial hexane products. In support of this contention,API (Ref. 3) provided a review of the scientific data on commercial hexaneand submitted a single-generation inhalation reproductive effects studywhich was completed after publication of the proposal. API (Ref. 3) andExxon (Ref. 6) further contended that evaluation of these studies indicatesthat the proposed testing would not provide additional information relevantto assessing the risk from exposure to commercial hexane and that testingcommercial hexane under TSCA section 4 is unnecessary.The Agency reviewed the data provided in response to the proposal as wellas those obtained from a literature review and concurs that the data areadequate to predict the acute toxicity of commercial hexane exposure tohumans. However, the Agency has concluded that the data are inadequateto assess the risk of commercial hexane exposure to humans for all otherhealth effects endpoints required by this rule.Concerning the adequacy of health effects studies other than acute toxicity,industry commenters contend that the <T3>n</T3>-hexane component of the commercial hexane mixture is the drivingvariable in the hazard characterization of the mixture. For instance, Exxon(Ref. 6) stated that commercial hexane produces toxic responses which canbe accounted for by its <T3>n</T3>-hexane content. In addition, in its supplemental comments, API(Ref. 4) claimed that EPA failed to consider all available informationon commercial hexane and its constituents and that the data provide ampleinformation to assess the adverse effects of exposure to commercial hexane.API, therefore, contended that a finding of data insufficiency could notbe sustained.EPA disagrees with the assumption that <T3>n</T3>-hexane is the only component of the mixture possessing potentiallyadverse toxicological properties and that commercial hexane will behavesimilarly to <T3>n</T3>-hexane. While EPA acknowledges the wealth of data on <T3>n</T3>-hexane, it is not willing to rely solely on those data to evaluatethe health effects of the mixture at this time. Not only are the effectsof the other constituents of commercial hexane unknown, but the interactionof <T3>n</T3>-hexane with the other components of commercial hexane is unknown.Moreover, these data also do not include all health effects endpoints requiredby this rule due to the widespread exposure to commercial hexane. Consequently,EPA believes that the data are inadequate to characterize the toxicityfor health effects of commercial hexane other than for acute toxicity andthat testing is necessary for the additional health endpoints. Industrycomments on these data have been reviewed at length in the technical supportdocument (Ref. 1). The following discussion is a brief overview of industrycomments on data adequacy and modifications to the proposed health effectstesting in response to those comments:a. <T3>Acute toxicity.</T3> EPA's initial evaluation indicated that therewere no adequate acute toxicity data on commercial hexane. Specifically,there is no LC<T2>50</T2> for commercial hexane. API (Refs. 3 and 4) commented that acutestudies of commercial hexane show no mortality at 5 mg/1, the limit testin the TSCA test guidelines, and that testing to determine an LC<T2>50</T2> is not necessary for chemicals whose acute toxicity is in excessof the limit test.API (Ref. 3) and Exxon (Ref. 6) cited acute toxicity studies by Hine andZuidema (Ref. 7) and Lazarew (Ref. 8) which reported exposures in animalsbetween 39,000 and 73,000 ppm. They also cited API's single-generationinhalation reproductive effects study (Ref. 3, Att. I) in which no grosseffects were observed at 1,500 ppm in rats exposed to commercial hexanefor 6 hours per day, 7 days per week for 100 days. Exxon stated that API'sstudy (Ref. 3, Att. I), although a subchronic study, demonstrated thatrats could be exposed repeatedly to levels exceeding the EPA acute inhalationtoxicity limit dose of 5 mg/1 without producing morbidity or mortality.Both API and Exxon also pointed out that not only was acute toxicity testingto determine an LC<T2>50</T2> unnecessary, it was also dangerous because to produce mortality,it would be necessary to exceed commercial hexane's lower explosive limit(LEL) of approximately 11,000 ppm.Having reviewed these studies along with additional acute studies, theAgency believes that requiring additional acute inhalation toxicity testingto determine an LC<T2>50</T2> of commercial hexane will provide little additional informationwhich will assist in characterizing the potential health risks to humansfor several reasons: (1) While the studies cited by API and Exxon havedeficiencies in that the test material was not always fully described,the concentration of the test material was not always determined, and thedescriptions of the effects of exposure were minimal, taken together, theyprovide a strong indication that the LC<T2>50</T2> for commercial hexane is above 30,000 ppm; and (2) it appearsthat the LC<T2>50</T2> for commercial hexane is within its explosive limits (11,000to 75,000 ppm), which would not only make testing hazardous but would alsopreclude such high occupational exposures because of the explosive hazard.Consequently, EPA believes that it can make reasonable predictions aboutthe acute toxicity of commercial hexane, has concluded that the proposedrequirement for acute inhalation toxicity testing (section 798.1150) todetermine an LC<T2>50</T2> is unnecessary, and has not included it in the final rule.However, EPA is retaining the requirement for schedule-controlled operantbehavior testing (section 798.6500) under acute neurotoxicity testing becauseof concerns for effects on the rate and pattern of behavioral responsesto commercial hexane.To accommodate API's concerns on the safety of the testing, however, EPAhas modified all of the remaining required tests so that the highest doseshould not exceed the lower explosive limit of commercial hexane.b. <T3>Subchronic toxicity.</T3> EPA proposed that a subchronic inhalationtoxicity test be conducted on commercial hexane because existing data submittedby Phillips Petroleum (Ref. 9, Att. IV) was considered inadequate to characterizethe nephrotoxicity of commercial hexane. API (Refs. 3 and 4) commentedthat existing data are adequate to predict the subchronic toxicity of commercialhexane. API (Refs. 3 and 4) and Exxon (Ref. 6) maintain that the studysubmitted by Phillips Petroleum adequately addresses the nephrotoxicityof commercial hexane and cited additional studies that further characterizethe subchronic toxicity of commercial hexane or similar products. API (Ref.3) believes that existing data demonstrate that the components of commercialhexane produce hydrocarbon-induced nephrotoxicity and that it would bea waste of resources to require a 90-day study to demonstrate an adverseeffect already known. However, Exxon (Ref. 6) believes that the inductionof nephropathy in male rats has no human clinical significance.EPA disagrees that these data adequately address the potential for commercialhexane to be nephrotoxic. These data are inadequate because each studyhad experimental limitations, such as short duration, which compromisedthe interpretation of the findings (Ref. 1). In addition, EPA believesthat a comprehensive inhalation subchronic toxicity test for commercialhexane is necessary to determine whether endpoints other than neurotoxicitymight be more sensitive indicators of commercial hexane's toxicity at lowerdoses. Consequently, EPA has retained the proposed requirement for subchronictoxicity teting by inhalation. For consistency with other test rules, thefinal rule requires that the animals be dosed for 6 hours per day, 5 daysper week for 90 days.c. <T3>Oncogenicity.</T3> API (Refs. 3 and 4) commented that the data areadequate to reasonably predict the oncogenicity of commercial hexane andthat a chronic bioassay would not add significant information for a quantitativerisk assessment. In support of this contention, API (Ref. 3) cited twonegative cancer studies on <T3>n</T3>-hexane.EPA disagrees with API that the studies conducted by Sice (Ref. 11) andby Ranadive et al. (Ref. 12) fulfill the requirement of an inhalation oncogenicitytest on commercial hexane. These studies exposed animals dermally to onlyone dose level of <T3>n</T3>-hexane, tested only one species and one sex, and contained toofew animals. Consequently, EPA has retained the requirement for oncogenicitytesting. The Agency believes that existing data are inadequate and thattesting is necessary to determine the oncogenic risk of exposure to commercialhexane.d. <T3>Reproductive toxicity.</T3> API (Refs. 3 and 4) commented that itssingle-generation inhalation reproductive effects study of commercial hexane(Ref. 2, Att. I) is adequate for substances which do not bioaccumulate.EPA has reviewed this study and believes that it is inadequate to assessthe potential reproductive toxicity of commercial hexane (Ref. 13). Thehighest dose level was too low, and the sample size for histopathologicalevaluation of male reproductive organs was too small, to assess any adverseeffect. In addition, the paper by Christian (Ref. 14) which API used tosupport its contention that single-generation studies are sufficient toassess a chemical's reproductive toxicity requiring two-generation studiesshould be altered. EPA believes that a well-conducted, two-generation studyis necessary to assess commercial hexane's potential reproductive effectsand has retained the proposed requirement for a two-generation reproductiveeffects study of commercial hexane.Concerning animal strains, EPA recommends the use of Sprague-Dawley ratsin both the developmental and the reproductive toxicity studies for thefollowing reasons: API's single-generation inhalation reproductive effectsstudy (Ref. 3, Att. I) was conducted on commercial hexane in Sprague-Dawleyrats; the data base on Sprague-Dawley rats for these two health effectsis much greater than for Fischer 344 rats; and, in general, Fischer 344rats are not good breeders and, therefore, are not a good choice of strainin developmental and reproductive effects testing.e. <T3>Developmental toxicity.</T3> API (Refs. 3 and 4) commented that itssingle-generation reproductive effects study of commercial hexane (Ref.3. Att. I) had a satellite teratology component in rats which was adequateto predict the developmental toxicity of commercial hexane. EPA, however,believes that this study was inadequate to assess the potential developmentaltoxicity of commercial hexane (Ref. 13). The study was inadequate becausethe highest dose level failed to elicit significant signs of maternal toxicity.In addition, only animals in the control and highest dose groups were analyzed,and restrictions in sample size of pregnant animals hampered meaningfulinterpretation of results. EPA believes that a well-conducted developmentaltoxicity study in two species, such as rats and rabbits, will provide neededdata on commercial hexane's potential developmental toxicity and has retainedthe proposed requirement for a developmental toxicity study of commercialhexane.f. <T3>Mutagenicity.</T3> API (Refs. 3 and 4) and Exxon (Ref. 6) commentedthat the data are adequate to evaluate the genotoxicity of the componentsof commercial hexane and are therefore adequate to predict its potentialmutagenicity, and that further testing would provide no further informationand would be a waste of resources. They further commented that the weightof available evidence suggests that commercial hexane poses no risk forthe induction of heritable genetic effects.EPA considers the data presented by API (Ref. 3) as suggestive of the effectsanticipated for commercial hexane but not adequate to fully characterizeits genotoxicity. Because the components of commercial hexane have undergoneonly limited genotoxicity testing and because the data base is insufficientto extrapolate from the individual components to the commercial hexanemixture, EPA disagrees with industry and has retained the proposed requirementfor mutagenicity testing.API (Ref. 3) requested an additional 4 weeks to conduct the <T3>in vivo </T3>mutagenicity testing because of the difficulty in administeringthe test substance by inhalation and an additional six months to conductthe pharmacokinetics testing because of its complexity. For upper-tiermutagenicity testing triggered by lower-tier test results in particular,API requested that the deadline for the final reports be based on the testtrigger dates rather than on the effective date of the final rule. Since issuing the proposal, EPA has reviewed the time periods that it willspecify for conducting these health effects tests. For consistency withthe other TSCA section 4 final test rules recently promulgated and pursuantto API's request, the final reporting requirements have been modified toallow additional time for conducting the following tests: <T3>Salmonella typhimurium </T3>assay_4 additional months; gene mutationin mammalian cells in culture_5 additional months; <T3>in vitro </T3>cytogenetics assay_5 additional months; <T3>in vivo </T3>cytogenetics assay_7 additional months; rodent dominantlethal assay_4 additional months; heritable translocation assay_1 additionalmonth; and schedule-controlled operant behavior, functional observationbattery, motor activity, and neuropathology_3 additional months. Althoughan acute test, the final report of schedule-controlled operant behaviorhas been increased to 15 months to coincide with the final reports of the3 subchronic neurotoxicity tests. EPA proposed a tiered testing approach to evaluate whether commercial hexaneelicits heritable gene mutations. Positive results in certain lower-tiertests would trigger the requirement for conducting a mouse visible specificlocus (MVSL) test. EPA believes that the MVSL is necessary, when certainlower-tier tests are positive, to establish definitively whether a substanceis capable of eliciting heritable gene mutations. Under the approach proposed,EPA would consider the positive results in lower-tier tests in a publicprogram review, together with other relevant information, during whichinterested persons would be able to give their views to the Agency. If,after the review, EPA determined that the MVSL was still appropriate, EPAwould notify the test sponsors by letter or <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice that they must conduct the test. If EPAdetermined that the test was no longer necessary, EPA would propose toamend the rule to delete the test requirement. The final test rule for commercial hexane includes requirements to conductthe lower-tier tests for gene mutations. However, EPA is not promulgatingthe requirement for the MVSL for commercial hexane at this time. EPA hadbased its proposal to require the MVSL, in part, on information and assumptionsabout the cost of conducting the test and the availability of laboratoriescapable of performing the test. The information and assumptions have sinceproven to be incorrect. Accordingly, EPA is in the process of reexaminingthe MVSL requirement for this test rule as well as those for other chemicalsubstances. In particular EPA is reviewing whether any laboratories areavailable to perform the MVSL for industry in accordance with the TSCAGood Laboratory Practice Standards at 40 CFR Part 792 and the cost of suchtesting. EPA is also reviewing possible alternative tests to the MVSL forwhich costs may be lower or laboratory availability may be more certain.Once EPA completes its evaluation of this additional information, EPA willpublish a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> concerning the MVSL for commercial hexane andother substances subject to TSCA section 4 test rules. This notice willprovide up-to-date information on the cost of MVSL testing, availabilityof laboratories to perform the MVSL, and possible alternative tests tothe MVSL together with their costs and laboratory availability. The noticewill also address EPA's intentions about any changes to the MVSL requirementsin the various test rules and will provide an opportunity for public comment.If, after this exercise, EPA concludes that the MVSL is still appropriatefor commercial hexane, EPA will amend this final test rule for commercialhexane to add the MVSL requirements with any appropriate modifications.Concerning upper-tier mutagenicity tests triggered by lower-tier test results,EPA agrees with API that the deadlines for the final reports should bebased on the trigger dates rather than on the effective date of the finalrule. For consistency with other TSCA section 4 final test rules, the heritabletranslocation assay is triggered from the date of notification that testingis required rather than from the effective date of the final rule. Publicparticipation in this program review will be in the form of written publiccomments or a public meeting. Before the last tier mutagenicity testingis to begin, EPA will hold a public program review if the results of theprevious tier tests are positive. If, after review of public comment, nochange in the test sequence is deemed necessary, EPA will provide formalnotification to the test sponsor that the final tier tests must be conducted.If, however, EPA believes that additional testing is no longer warrantedas a result of review of earlier test results, public comments, scientificjudgment, and other appropriate factors, EPA will issue a proposed amendmentto rescind these requirements. Refer to the table in Unit IV.B. concerningother reporting requirements for commercial hexane testing.     g. <T3>Neurotoxicity testing. </T3>API (Refs. 3 and 4) and Exxon (Ref. 6)commented that there are sufficient data on the neurotoxicity of <T3>n</T3>-hexane and other C<T2>6</T2> hydrocarbons to reasonably predict the neurotoxic potentialof commercial hexane. They believe that the two API studies submitted byPhillips Petroleum (Ref. 9, Atts. II and III) adequately demonstrate that<T3>n</T3>-hexane is the only neurotoxic C<T2>6</T2> hydrocarbon. EPA disagrees with API and Exxon that these studies adequately addressthe potential neurotoxicity of commercial hexane. In addition, EPA believesthat these studies do not provide sufficient data to quantitatively predictthe risk of human exposure to commercial hexane because it is necessaryto test at the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) without exceeding the lowerexplosive limit of commercial hexane to determine whether C<T2>6</T2> hydrocarbons other than <T3>n</T3>-hexane are neurotoxic or potentiate the toxicity of <T3>n</T3>-hexane. Consequently, EPA has retained the requirement for neurotoxicity testing.Existing studies neither address the potential neurotoxicity of commercialhexane nor provide sufficient data to predict human risk. h. <T3>Pharmacokinetics. </T3>API (Refs. 3 and 4) commented that studies of<T3>n</T3>-hexane in animals and in humans have characterized its absorption,distribution, metabolism, and excretion and that <T3>n</T3>-hexane does not alter the pharmacokinetic behavior of the otherC<T2>6</T2> constituents. API also stated that it has an ongoing study inrats to evaluate the absorption of hydrocarbon vapors. EPA disagrees withAPI and believes that neither existing data nor the ongoing API study willbe adequate to characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism, orexcretion of commercial hexane. However, following an internal review of the proposed pharmacokineticsguideline, EPA determined that there were sections which would precludeobtaining meaningful data (e.g., the absence of intravenous dosing). Consequently,EPA will repropose a revised test standard and reporting requirements forinhalation and dermal pharmacokinetics at a later date. Concerning API's comments on the difficulty of conducting pharmacokineticstesting of the commercial hexane mixture, EPA agrees with API that isotopicallylabeling all components of commercial hexane would be burdensome. WhenEPA reproposes new methodology for the pharmacokinetics test standard,it will propose labeling MCP in commercial hexane and separately labeling<T3>n</T3>-hexane in commercial hexane as suggested by API (Ref. 3). 2. Comment: <T3>Inaccurate characterization of production and use led to an undocumentedfinding of significant human exposure to commercial hexane. </T3>WhileAPI (Ref. 3) recognizes the information-gathering function of TSCA section4, it questioned the accuracy of EPA's characterization of commercial hexane'sproduction and use in the proposal. API believes that the Agency's characterizationof commercial hexane neither reflects current manufacturing processes noraccurately describes the composition of the majority of current commercialhexane products. EPA has evaluated the data submitted by API and has concluded, nevertheless,that there may be widespread exposure to commercial hexane from its productionand uses. EPA has made reasonable assumptions based on standard engineeringprinciples that human exposure to commercial hexane will occur during itsmanufacture, processing, use, and disposal. The Agency's assumptions forexposure to commercial hexane were based upon its high volatility, highproduction, high number of potentially exposed workers, and potential consumerexposure through paints and solvents. The Agency believes that these assumptionssupport a finding under TSCA section 4(a)(1)(B) that there may be substantialhuman exposure to commercial hexane. 3. Comment: <T3>Information on commercial hexane and similar C</T3><T2>6</T2><T3> products, including MCP, makes testing unnecessary. </T3>API (Ref.3) and Exxon (Ref. 6) believe that EPA failed to identify all relevantdata on C<T2>6</T2> isomers. Exxon (Ref. 6) believes that existing data and experiencewith C<T2>6</T2>-containing substances other than commercial hexane, e.g., motorfuels, are relevant to determining the effects of human exposure to C<T2>6</T2> isomers. Exxon further contends that a full analysis of allC<T2>6</T2> exposure data may allow a finding that exposure to C<T2>6</T2> isomers does not present an unreasonable health risk. Exxonalso claimed that the data on commercial hexane are sufficient for a quantitativerisk assessment and therefore for regulatory action under TSCA section6. Because Exxon believes that EPA can make at this time a determinationthat there is no risk to human health or the environment, it believes thatfurther testing under TSCA section 4 is unwarranted and requests that theproposal be withdrawn. While there may be information on commercial hexane and similar C<T2>6</T2> products, EPA believes that such information is inadequate toevaluate the potential health effects from exposure to commercial hexaneor similar C<T2>6</T2> products for all but acute effects, as discussed in Unit II.A.1above. Other endpoints have not been tested adequately. In addition, thetest methodologies specified in this rule are more sensitive and the testsmore refined than were those used for existing studies. EPA believes thatadditional data are necessary to determine whether exposure to commercialhexane does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health.B. Response to Issues Raised in the Proposed Rule1. Issue: <T3>How should commercial hexane be defined so as to determine who is subjectto the rule? </T3>EPA proposed to test a type of commercial hexane withthe greatest MCP content to which humans are most likely exposed and atthe same time assumed that this material would be representative of commercialhexanes produced by major manufacturers. API (Refs. 3 and 18), however,contended that this characterization neither reflected current manufacturingpractices nor applied to a significant portion of currently produced commercialhexanes. Consequently, the Agency granted an additional 60 days for APIand its member companies to develop a more representative definition ofcommercial hexane and to better determine manufacturers and processorssubject to the rule. From the results of an API survey indicating that<T3>n</T3>-hexane comprised 40 to 86 liquid volume percent and MCP 5 to15 liquid volume percent of commercial hexanes, API (Ref. 3) provided analternative definition of commercial hexane, developed by the AmericanSociety for Testing and Materials (ASTM), ASTM D 1836 (Ref. 16).Accordingly, EPA has revised the definition of commercial hexane to containa minimum of 40 rather than 50 liquid volume percent <T3>n</T3>-hexane and a minimum of 5 liquid volume percent MCP and otherwiseconform to the specifications prescribed in ASTM D 1836. API (Ref. 3) statedthat this revised definition includes all identified products manufacturedand used as commercial hexane. EPA interprets this to mean that the reviseddefinition includes the products produced by all known manufacturers andprocessors of commercial hexane, making all of them subject to this testrule.2. Issue: <T3>Which substance should be tested to characterize the toxicity of commercialhexane: commercial hexane A or n-hexane-free C</T3><T4>6</T4> isomers? EPA proposed that the test substance consist of commercialhexane A, or solvent grade, derived from the fractionation of straight-rungasoline, consisting of no more than 64 liquid volume percent <T3>n-</T3>hexane and no less than 19 liquid volume percent MCP. The Agencybelieved that maximizing the MCP content of commercial hexane would providemore useful test data. Pursuant to comments from API (Ref. 3), EPA hasdeleted reference to the feedstock origin and the grade of commercial hexanein the final rule and defers to API's analysis that commercial hexane madeaccording to the specifications of ASTM D 1836 is the one to which thereis the greatest exposure. However, to assure that the full potential forMCP's toxicity might be expressed, EPA has modified API's recommendationby specifying that not less than 10 liquid volume percent MCP be presentin the test substance. The Agency believes that this modification willaccommodate API's concerns and yet will represent a worst-case exposureto MCP and C<T2>6</T2> isomers other than <T3>n-</T3>hexane.3. Issue: <T3>Should the subchronic test standards be modified to follow the 22 hours/day,7 days/week, 6-month dosing regimen of the API and Egan et al. studies?</T3>When comparing the toxicity of <T3>n-</T3>hexane with and without other C<T2>6</T2> isomers, Egan et al. (Ref. 23) and API (Ref. 9, Atts. II andIII) used a dosing regimen of 22 hours/day, 7 days/week for 6 months. Whendetermining the subchronic toxicity of <T3>n-</T3>hexane in rats, Cavender et al. (Ref. 24) of the Chemical IndustryInstitute of Technology (CIIT) used 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 6 months.The National Toxicology Program (NTP) currently is using a dosing regimenof 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 6 months to determine the subchronic toxicityof <T3>n-</T3>hexane in mice. Unless anticipating exposure of humans to asubstance is continuous, under TSCA section 4, EPA typically specifiesa dosing regimen of 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for a 90-day period in a subchronictoxicity test. Because of the differences in dosing regimens, EPA requestedcomment on whether the dosing regimen should be increased from 6 hours/dayfor 5 days/week to 22 hours/day for 7 days/week.At the public meeting, Bus (Ref. 5), in discussing the importance of durationof daily exposure to study design, stated that for compounds such as <T3>n-</T3>hexane, 22-hour per day rather than 6-hour per day exposuredurations give a more rapid onset at lower exposure concentrations.The Agency has studied these comments but disagrees that the duration ofexposure should be increased for subchronic toxicity testing of commercialhexane for several reasons. First, continuous inhalation exposure designsdo not approximate conditions of human exposure to commercial hexane andtherefore do not adequately define threshold levels of toxicity under expectedexposure conditions. Compared to 6-hour per day, 5-day per week exposures,continuous exposure experiments use an exposure scenario not comparableto either workplace or consumer exposures. Second, the protocol requiredby the Agency is designed to mimic worker exposure, the population mostlikely to be exposed to commercial hexane. Third, the results from thestudy would be comparable to those from other subchronic testing requiredunder TSCA section 4 by EPA for chemicals in the workplace. Chemicals primarilyfound in the home or other institutions in which humans may be continuouslyexposed would serve as better candidates for the continuous exposure regimen.Finally, continuous exposures do not permit a recovery period, potentiallyoverloading metabolic systems.An additional comment on the exposure regimen used in existing studieswas provided by Wood (Ref. 25). Wood raised concerns that there could havebeen flaws in the exposure generation methods used by Egan et al. (Ref.23) resulting in lower actual doses than specified in the experimentaldesign. Wood contends that because of potential variations in exposureconcentrations, Egan et al. were probably unsuccessful in maintaining thesustained exposure levels necessary for the identification of neurotoxicitycomparable to that produced by <T3>n-</T3>hexane.Consequently, because the composition of the atmosphere containing thetest substance could change, the Agency recommends that there be sufficientmonitoring of the concentrations of the test substance and its componentsto ensure that the composition of the atmosphere containing the test substanceand its components do not vary significantly throughout the exposure periodof each test.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Decision to Terminate Rulemaking for Health Effects Testing ofMCP </ITAG>Under TSCA section 4(a), EPA had proposed to require testing of MCP. Althoughisolated MCP has not been sold in the U.S. since 1982 (Ref. 9), the proposalnoted that MCP is a substantial component of various hexane-containingrefinery streams and products whose manufacture, processing, and use resultin extensive, albeit indirect, exposure of workers, consumers, and thegeneral population. EPA also recognized that MCP was isolated in the pastand could be isolated either at present or in the future. In addition,the Agency's proposed findings for health effects testing of MCP were basedupon positive hazard evidence to support a ``may present an unreasonablerisk'' finding under section 4(a)(1)(A) for neurotoxicity (nerve functionaldeficits) and subchronic toxicity (nephrotoxicity) as well as potentialexposure of 38,000 workers to MCP. Furthermore, in an EPA survey, MCP wasdetected in breast milk samples. However, because at this time MCP is notisolated and because all current exposure results from exposure to mixturescontaining MCP, the Agency believes that testing MCP as a discrete substanceis unnecessary and is terminating rulemaking under TSCA section 4(a) atthis time. The Agency reached this decision after reevaluating existing data in conjunctionwith comments from industry in response to the proposed rule. Consequently,the Agency has decided to terminate rulemaking on the health effects testingof MCP for the following reasons: 1. MCP currently is not isolated; it is not manufactured for direct sales;and its production as a discrete substance has not been reported underthe TSCA Inventory Update Rule (Ref. 17). Furthermore, from industry'scomments on the proposed test rule, the Agency does not anticipate anyfuture isolated production of MCP. 2. There is a naphtha stream consisting of benzene and 60 to 80 percentMCP that is used to make cyclohexane. Although there may be the potentialfor greater exposure to MCP by virtue of its greater content in the naphthastream compared to its content in commercial hexane, the process is limitedto one manufacturer with only a few potentially exposed workers. Furthermore,this patented process is not expected to proliferate to other manufacturersafter expiration of the patent in 12 years. 3. Because exposure to MCP almost always involves exposure to other C<T2>6</T2> isomers, and because the highest MCP concentration to whichworkers and consumers are typically exposed is in commercial hexane, EPAagrees with industry comments that commercial hexane is a more appropriatetest substance than MCP. EPA believes that it is better first to test commercialhexane rather than each of its C<T2>6</T2> components individually. If health effects are positive forcommercial hexane, then EPA may consider testing the C<T2>6</T2> components individually. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Final Test Rule for Commercial Hexane </ITAG>A. Findings EPA is basing its final health effects testing requirements for commercialhexane on the authority of section 4(a)(1)(B) of TSCA.Under section 4(a)(1)(B), EPA finds that commercial hexane is producedin substantial quantities and that there is or may be substantial humanexposure from its manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, anduse. Approximately 500 million pounds of commercial hexane were producedin 1985 (Ref. 26). In addition, according to the National OccupationalExposure Survey of 1985 (NOES), 83,000 workers are estimated to have actualexposure to hexane solvents. Of these, 12,576 are women (Ref. 19). Commercialhexanes are used as components of lacquers, printing inks, and adhesives,and as seed oil extractants (Ref. 2). Such uses may result in widespreadexposure to workers and consumers. While EPA believes that there may be substantial human exposure to C<T2>6</T2> hydrocarbons in gasoline, EPA is not considering exposure tothe C<T2>6</T2> fraction through exposure to gasoline as part of its basis forfinding substantial human exposure to commercial hexane. The Agency believesthat exposures associated with the manufacture and processing of commercialhexanes and use of solvents containing significant concentrations of C<T2>6</T2> isomers provide sufficient basis for a finding of substantialhuman exposure for commercial hexane under TSCA section 4(a)(1)(B)(i).In the proposed rule, the Agency requested comments as to whether thereexisted studies in the published and unpublished literature that wouldadequately describe the potential health effects of commercial hexane.EPA's initial evaluation had indicated that there were inadequate datato predict commercial hexane's acute and subchronic toxicities, oncogenicity,reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, mutagenicity, neurotoxicity,and pharmacokinetics in humans exposed from its manufacture, processing,distribution in commerce, and use. To determine the adequacy of health effects data on commercial hexane,EPA reviewed data submitted in response to the proposal by API (Refs. 3and 4) and by Exxon (Ref. 6) as well as data from the scientific literature.Consequently, EPA finds that there are sufficient data by inhalation exposureto reasonably determine or predict the acute effects of human exposureto commercial hexane resulting from its manufacture, processing, distributionin commerce, and use. Therefore, the Agency has concluded that there isno need to require acute toxicity testing of commercial hexane. However,EPA finds that there are insufficient data to reasonably determine or predictthe subchronic toxicity, the oncogenicity, the reproductive toxicity, thedevelopmental toxicity, the mutagenicity, the neurotoxicity, and the pharmacokineticsin humans exposed to commercial hexane from its manufacture, processing,distribution in commerce, and use. EPA believes that the data resultingfrom these test requirements will be relevant to a determination that themanufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, and use of commercialhexane does or does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to humanhealth. For these reasons, EPA finds that testing is necessary to developsuch data. B. Required Testing, Test Standards, and Reporting Requirements On the basis of these findings, the Agency is requiring that health effectstesting be conducted for commercial hexane in accordance with specifictest guidelines set forth in 40 CFR Part 798 as enumerated in the followingtable. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>REQUIRED TESTING, TEST STANDARDS, AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMERCIALHEXANE </T4><H1>Test </H1><H1>40 CFR citation \1\ </H1><H1>Reporting deadline for final report \2\ </H1><H1>Number of interim (6-mo) reports required</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Subchronic toxicity:</T3> Subchronic inhalation toxicity <D>andSection; 798.2450 </D><D>15 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Chronic toxicity: </T3>Oncogenicity <D>andSection; 798.3300 </D><D>53 </D><D>8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Specific organ/tissue toxicity:</T3> <D> </D><D> </D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Reporduction and fertility effects <D>andSection; 798.4700 </D><D>29 </D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Inhalation developmental toxicity <D>andSection; 798.4350 </D><D>12 </D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Genetic toxicity:</T3> <D> </D><D> </D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2"><T3>Gene Mutations: </T3><D> </D><D> </D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Salmonella typhimurium</T3> <D>andSection; 798.5265 </D><D>8 </D><D>0 </D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3/>Mammalian cells in culture <D>andSection; 798.5300 </D><D>17 </D><D>2 </D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>Drosophila </T3>sex-linked recessive lethal <D>andSection; 798.5275 </D><D>24 </D><D>3 </D><ITAG tagnum="2"><T3>Chromosomal Aberrations:</T3> <D> </D><D> </D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>In vitro </T3>cytogenetics <D>andSection; 798.5375 </D><D>9 </D><D>0 </D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3>In vivo </T3>cytogenetics <D>andSection; 798.5385 </D><D>19 </D><D>3 </D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3/>Dominant lethal assay <D>andSection; 798.5450 </D><D>28 </D><D>4 </D><ITAG tagnum="3"/><T3/>Heritable translocation assay <D>andSection; 798.5460 </D><D>\3\ 25 </D><D>4 </D><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Acute neurotoxicity: </T3>Schedule-controlled operant behavior <D>andSection; 798.6500 </D><D>15 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Subchronic neurotoxicity: </T3> <D>  </D><D> </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2"><T3/>Functional observation battery <D>andSection; 798.6050 </D><D>15 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2"><T3/>Motor activity <D>andSection; 798.6200 </D><D>15 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2"><T3/>Neuropathology <D>andSection; 798.6400 </D><D>15 </D><D>2 </D><F>\1\ As modified in andSection; 799.2155. </F><F>\2\ Number of months after the effective date of the final rule, exceptas indicated. </F><F>\3\ Figure indicates the reporting deadline, in months, calculated fromthe date of notification of the test sponsor by certified letter or </F><T4>Federal Register</T4> notice that, following public program reviewof all of the then existing data for commerical hexane, the Agency hasdetermined that the required testing must be performed.</ITAG></ITAG> Revisions to these guidelines were proposed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of January 14, 1986 (51 FR 1522) and were promulgatedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 20, 1987 (52 FR 19056).The Agency is requiring that the above-referenced TSCA health effects testguidelines be the test standards for the purposes of the required testsfor commercial hexane. The TSCA test guidelines for health effects testingspecify generally accepted minimum conditions for determining the healtheffects of substances like commercial hexane to which humans are expectedto be exposed. The Agency believes that these test methods reflect thecurrent state-of-the-art science and minimum requirements for the conductof these tests. However, because of the high volatility and explosive propertiesof commercial hexane and because human exposure occurs primarily by inhalation,EPA is requiring chemical-specific modifications to all of the requiredtest methods that take into account these factors.All data developed under this rule must be reported in accordance withTSCA Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Standards which appear in 40 CFR Part792.In accordance with 40 CFR Part 790 under single-phase rulemaking procedures,test sponsors are required to submit individual study plans at least 45days before the initiation of each test.EPA is required by TSCA section 4(b)(1)(C) to specify the time period duringwhich persons subject to a test rule must submit test data. The rule specifiesthe reporting requirements for each of the required test standards forcommercial hexane. Interim progress reports for certain studies must beprovided to the Agency at 6-month intervals as indicated in the rule untilthe final report has been submitted to EPA.TSCA section 14(b) governs Agency disclosure of all test data submittedpursuant to section 4 of TSCA. Upon receipt of data required by this rule,the Agency will publish a notice of receipt in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>as required by section 4(d).Persons who export a chemical substance or mixture which is subject toa section 4 test rule are subject to the export reporting requirementsof section 12(b) of TSCA. Final regulations interpreting the requirementsof section 12(b) are in 40 CFR Part 707. In brief, as of the effectivedate of this test rule, an exporter of commercial hexane must report toEPA the first export or intended export of commercial hexane to a particularcountry in a calendar year. EPA will notify the foreign country concerningthe test rule for the chemical.C. Test SubstanceConcerning the definition of commercial hexane so as to determine who issubject to the rule, the rule defines commercial hexane as containing aminimum of 40 liquid volume percent <T3>n</T3>-hexane, a minimum of 5 liquid volume percent MCP, and otherwiseconforming to the specifications prescribed in ASTM D 1836. The requirementthat commercial hexane contain at least 5 liquid volume percent MCP remainsthe same as in the proposed rule because API's survey indicated commercialhexanes currently produced contain at least 5 liquid volume percent MCP.This definition determines which manufacturers and processors are subjectto the rule.Concerning the composition of the actual test substance, EPA is specifyingthat the test substance contain no more than 40 liquid volume percent <T3>n</T3>-hexane, no less than 10 liquid volume percent MCP, and otherwiseconform to the specifications prescribed in ASTM D 1836. EPA believes thatthe commercial hexane being tested should be defined in this manner toassure that the full potential for MCP toxicity may be expressed. In addition,such a test substance will be similar to the test material used in API'ssingle-generation inhalation reproductive effects study (Ref. 3, Att. I).By specifying a commercial hexane test substance with no more than 40 percent<T3>n</T3>-hexane and no less than 10 percent MCP, EPA believes that thetest substance will represent a worst-case exposure to MCP and C<T2>6</T2> isomers other than <T3>n</T3>-hexane and provide a complement to existing data on <T3>n</T3>-hexane.D. Persons Required to TestSection 4(b)(3)(B) specifies that the activities for which EPA makes section4(a) findings (manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use,and/or disposal) determine who bears the responsibility for testing a chemical.Manufacturers and persons who intend to manufacture the chemical are requiredto test if the findings are based on manufacturing (``manufacture'' isdefined in section 3(7) of TSCA to include ``import''). Processors andpersons who intend to process the chemical are required to test if thefindings are based on processing. Manufacturers and processors and personswho intend to manufacture and process the chemical are required to testif the exposure giving rise to the potential risk occur during distributionin commerce, use, or disposal of the chemical.Because EPA has found that manufacturing, processing, distribution in commerce,and use of commercial hexane give rise to exposure that may lead to anunreasonable risk, persons who manufacture or process, or who intend tomanufacture or process, commercial hexane, other than as an impurity, atany time from the effective date of the final test rule to the end of thereimbursement period are subject to the testing requirements containedin this final rule. The end of the reimbursement period will be 5 yearsafter the last report is submitted or an amount of time equal to that whichwas required to develop data, if more than 5 years after the submissionof the last final report required under the test rule.Because TSCA contains provisions to avoid duplicative testing, not everyperson subject to this rule must individually conduct testing. Section4(b)(3)(A) of TSCA provides that EPA may permit two or more manufacturersor processors who are subject to the rule to designate one such personor a qualified third person to conduct the tests and submit data on theirbehalf. Section 4(c) provides that any person required to test may applyto EPA for an exemption from the requirement. EPA promulgated proceduresfor applying for TSCA section 4(c) exemptions in 40 CFR Part 790.Manufacturers (including importers) subject to this rule are required tosubmit either a letter of intent to perform testing or an exemption applicationwithin 30 days after the effective date of the final test rule. The requiredprocedures for submitting such letters and applications are described in40 CFR Part 790. Although EPA has not identified any individuals who manufacturecommercial hexane as a byproduct, such persons will be subject to the requirementsof this test rule.Processors subject to this rule, unless they are also manufacturers, willnot be required to submit letters of intent or exemption applications,or to conduct testing, unless manufacturers fail to submit notices of intentto test or later fail to sponsor the required tests. The Agency expectsthat the manufacturers will pass an appropriate portion of the costs oftesting on to processors through the pricing of their products or reimbursementmechanisms. If manufacturers perform all the required tests, processorswill be granted exemptions automatically. If manufacturers fail to submitnotices of intent to test or fail to sponsor all the required tests, theAgency will publish a separate notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> to notify processors to respond; this procedureis described in 40 CFR Part 790.EPA is not requiring the submission of equivalence data as a conditionfor exemption from the required testing for commercial hexane. As notedin Unit II.B., EPA is requiring a specific type of commercial hexane fortesting and believes that testing such a substance will allow reasonableprediction of the potential of various commercial hexane products to causethe effects to be studied. For the purposes of this rule, EPA assumes thatall commercial hexanes are equivalent to the commercial hexane test substance.Manufacturers and processors subject to this test rule must comply withthe test rule development and exemption procedures in 40 CFR Part 790 forsingle-phase rulemaking.E. Enforcement ProvisionsThe Agency considers failure to comply with any aspect of a section 4 ruleto be a violation of section 15 of TSCA. Section 15(1) of TSCA makes itunlawful for any person to fail or refuse to comply with any rule or orderissued under section 4. Section 15(3) of TSCA makes it unlawful for anyperson to fail or refuse to: (1) Establish or maintain records, (2) submitreports, notices, or other information, or (3) permit access to or copyingof records required by TSCA or any regulation or rule issued under TSCA.Additionally, TSCA section 15(4) makes it unlawful for any person to failor refuse to permit entry or inspection as required by TSCA section 11.Section 11 applies to any ``establishment, facility, or other premisesin which chemical substances or mixtures are manufactured, processed, stored,or held before or after their distribution in commerce * * *'' The Agencyconsiders a testing facility to be a place where the chemical is held orstored and, therefore, subject to inspection. Laboratory inspections anddata audits will be conducted periodically in accordance with the authorityand procedures outlined in TSCA section 11 by duly designated representativesof the EPA for the purpose of determining compliance with the final rulefor commercial hexane. These inspections may be conducted for purposeswhich include verification that testing has begun, schedules are beingmet, and reports accurately reflect the underlying raw data, interpretations,and evaluations, and to determine compliance with TSCA GLP standards andthe test standards established in the rule.EPA's authority to inspect a testing facility also derives from section4(b)(1) of TSCA, which directs EPA to promulgate standards for the developmentof test data. These standards are defined in section 3(12)(B) of TSCA toinclude those requirements necessary to assure that data developed undertesting rules are reliable and adequate, and to include such other requirementsas are necessary to provide such assurance. The Agency maintains that laboratoryinspections are necessary to provide this assurance.Violators of TSCA are subject to criminal and civil liability. Personswho submit materially misleading or false information in connection withthe requirement of any provision of this rule may be subject to penaltieswhich may be calculated as if they never submitted their data. Under thepenalty provisions of section 16 of TSCA, any person who violates section15 of TSCA could be subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for eachviolation with each day of operation in violation constituting a separateviolation. This provision would be applicable primarily to manufacturersthat fail to submit a letter of intent or an exemption request and thatcontinue manufacturing after the deadlines for such submissions. This provisionwould also apply to processors that fail to submit a letter of intent oran exemption application and continue processing after the Agency has notifiedthem of their obligation to submit such documents (see 40 CFR 790.28(b)).Knowing or willful violations could lead to the imposition of criminalpenalties of up to $25,000 for each day of violation and imprisonment forup to 1 year. In determining the amount of penalty, EPA will take intoaccount the seriousness of the violation and the degree of culpabilityof the violator as well as all the other factors listed in TSCA section16. Other remedies are available to EPA under section 17 of TSCA, suchas seeking an injunction to restrain violations of TSCA section 4.Individuals as well as corporations could be subject to enforcement actions.Sections 15 and 16 of TSCA apply to ``any person'' who violates provisionsof TSCA. EPA may, at its discretion, proceed against individuals as wellas companies themselves. In particular, this includes individuals who reportfalse information or who cause it to be reported. In addition, the submissionof false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements is a violation under 18U.S.C. 1001.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Economic Analysis of Final Rule</ITAG>To assess the economic impact of this rule, EPA has prepared an economicanalysis (Ref. 26) that evaluates the potential for significant economicimpacts on the industry as a result of the required testing. The economicanalysis estimates the costs of conducting the required testing and evaluatesthe potential for significant adverse economic impact as a result of thesetest costs by examining four market characteristics of commercial hexane:(1) Price sensitivity of demand; (2) industry cost charactertistics; (3)industry structure; and (4) market expectations. Because there was notany indication of adverse impact, no further economic analysis was performed.However, had the first level of analysis indicated a potential for significanteconomic impact, a more comprehensive and detailed analysis would havebeen conducted to more precisely predict the magnitude and distributionof the expected impact.Testing costs for the final rule for commercial hexane are estimated torange from $2.2 to $2.9 million. To predict the financial decision-makingpractices of manufacturing firms, these costs have been annualized. Annualizedcosts are compared with annual revenue as an indication of potential impact.The annualized costs represent equivalent constant costs which would haveto be recouped each year of the payback period in order to finance thetesting expenditure in the first year.The annualized test costs (using a cost of capital of 7 percent over aperiod of 15 years) range from $250,000 to $320,000. Based on 1985 productionof 480 million pounds, the unit test costs range from $0.0005 to $0.0007per pound. In relation to the selling price of $0.20 per pound for commercialhexane, these costs are equivalent to 0.26 to 0.33 percent of price.Based on these costs and the uses of commercial hexane, the economic analysisindicates that the potential for significant adverse economic impact asa result of this test rule is low. This conclusion is based on the followingobservations:1. The estimated unit test costs are low, 0.33 percent of the current pricein the upper-bound case.2. The overall demand for commercial hexane appears relatively inelasticwith respect to price in all of its major uses.Refer to the economic analysis for a complete discussion of test cost estimationand the potential for economic impact resulting from these costs.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Availability of Test Facilities and Personnel</ITAG>Section 4(b)(1) of TSCA requires EPA to consider ``* * * the reasonablyforeseeable availability of the facilities and personnel needed to performthe testing required under the rule.'' Therefore, EPA conducted a studyto assess the availability of test facilities and personnel to handle theadditional demand for testing services created by section 4 test rules.Copies of the study, Chemical Testing Industry: Profile of ToxicologicalTesting, can be obtained through the National Technical Information Service(NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161 (PB 82-140773).AIHC (Ref. 10) commented that the Agency did not adequately address inthe proposal the availability of facilities or personnel to conduct theneurotoxicity testing required by this rule. EPA has reviewed the availabilityof contract laboratory facilities to conduct the neurotoxicity testingrequirements (Ref. 20) and believes that facilities will be made availablefor conducting these tests. The laboratory review indicates that few laboratoriesare currently conducting these tests according to TSCA test guidelinesand TSCA GLP standards. However, the barriers faced by testing laboratoriesto gear-up for these barriers are not formidable. Laboratories will haveto invest in testing equipment and personnel training, but EPA believesthat these investments will be recovered as the neurotoxicity testing programunder TSCA section 4 continues. EPA's expectations of laboratory availabilitywere borne out under the testing requirements of the C<T2>9</T2> aromatic hydrocarbon fraction test rule (50 FR 20675; May17,1985). Pursuant to that rule, the manufacturers were able to contract witha laboratory to conduct the testing according to TSCA test guidelines andTSCA GLP standards.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Rulemaking Record</ITAG>EPA has established a record for this rulemaking, (docket number OPTS-42084C).This record contains the basic information considered by the Agency indeveloping this rule and appropriate <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices.This record includes the following information:A.

Executive Order 12291Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``Major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.EPA has determined that this test rule is not major because it does notmeet any of the criteria set forth in section 1(b) of the Order, i.e.,it will not have an annual effect on the economy of at least $100 million,will not cause a major increase in costs or prices, and will not have asignificant adverse effect on competition or the ability of US enterprisesto compete with foreign enterprises. The economic analysis of the testingof commercial hexane is discussed in Unit V.This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview as required by Executive Order 12291. Any written comments fromOMB to EPA, and any EPA response to those comments, are included in therulemaking record.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActUnder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (15 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>Pub. L. 96-354, September 19, 1980), EPA is certifyingthat this test rule will not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small businesses because: (1) They are not likely to performtesting themselves, or to participate in the organization of the testingeffort; (2) they will experience only very minor costs, if any, in securingexemption from testing requirements; and (3) they are unlikely to be affectedby reimbursement requirements.C. Paperwork Reduction ActOMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in thisfinal rule under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980(44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.,</T3> Pub. L. 96-511, December 11, 1980), and has assignedOMB control number 2070-0033.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 799</ITAG>Chemicals, Environmental protection, Hazardous substances, Incorporationby reference, Laboratories, Recordkeeping and reporting requirements, Testing.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 28, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">J.A.
