The U.S. Embassy in Rangoon ordered an evacuation of 95 Americandependents as a ``precautionary measure,'' said Ross Petzing, theU.S. Embassy spokesman in Bangkok. There were no reports that anyof the approximately 55 U.S. Embassy staff members would leave.   Diplomatic sources said the Italian, Israeli and several othersmall embassies sent out dependents in recent days and that theJapanese and larger Western embassies were considering evacuations.   Petzing said the first group of 45 Americans would arrive inBangkok on Thursday if the airport in Rangoon was open.   Anti-government forces have called for a nationwide strikeThursday to press demands for an interim government and democracyand it was believed airport workers would join in the work stoppage.   ``The streets are deserted, people are pretty much in fear oftheir property. Things have pretty much closed down,'' said aWestern diplomat in Rangoon. ``There is a widespread perceptionthat things have deteriorated.''   Today was the first time in nearly three weeks that the militarypresence has been obvious in Rangoon, where there was lootingTuesday.   As the troops rolled in the city, state-run Rangoon Radioannounced that the ``defense forces and the people's police forceshall open fire to impose control should they find that theselooters, bent on violence, continue their acts.''   It was the first stern warning about intervention to stoplooting, which began outside the city several weeks ago.   Radio Rangoon said its warning ``does not concern those peoplewho are demonstrating peacefully,'' referring to pro-democracydemonstrations against the three-week-old government of PresidentMaung Maung.   Looters broke into the Customs Department warehouse, a buildingof the Education Department and soap and textile factories. Thieveswere spotted carrying away air conditioners and office equipmentfrom the Rangoon office of the U.N. Food and AgricultureOrganization.   A livestock and poultry farm near the city's airport also waspilfered.   Many residents closed the doors of their homes and shops, andtraffic was minimal.   The Western diplomat said the looting was probably the act ofdesperate and poor people taking advantage of the breakdown of lawand order rather than an anti-government move. Other analystsbelieve disorder is being purposely stoked by authorities tojustify further crackdowns.   Protesters blame the Burma Socialist Program Party for 26 yearsof repression and inept ecoomic policies that have turned Burmainto one of the world's poorest nations.   Ne Win, who seized power in a military coup 26 years ago, blamedstudent unrest in March and June in part for his decision to resignin July. He was replaced by Sein Lwin, whose appointment sparkedriots in which hundreds of people died.   Sein Lwin resigned after 17 days and was replaced by MaungMaung, Burma's first civilian leader since the coup, but protestshave continued.   Despite a crumbling administration, defections from the rulingparty and signs of dissatisfaction within the powerful military,the government has refused to budge from its plan for the partyleadership to meet Monday to consider organizing a referendum onending one-party rule.   On Tuesday, 187 Foreign Ministry employees resigned from theruling party to protest the government's refusal to bow to thepeople's demands.   Also today, a government newspaper accused a former army majorof using his influence to lure to their deaths 20 students andBuddhist monks who were behind many of the protests against 26years of authoritarian rule.   The Working People's Daily said that Zau Htaung, a former armymajor, offered a cash bounty for the heads of students and monks.It said Zau Htaung persuaded residents of a Rangoon suburb to lureto a biscuit factory the students and monks, who were members of alocal ``vigilance committee''.   It said Zau Htaung and 40 other people involved in the deathsfled after being attacked by a mob, but it said 38 of them werecaptured.   The newspaper did not say whether Zau Htaung acted on his owninitiative or why he had allegedly organized the killings.</TEXT></DOC>
