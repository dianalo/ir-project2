Indoing so, language was included which, while perhaps workable in connectionwith mortgages covering newly constructed or substantially rehabilitatedcooperative projects, has been shown to be inappropriate for the insuranceof existing projects. Without the clarifying revisions contained in thisrule, a significant number (perhaps a majority) of existing projects whichwould normally be expected to utilize this type of FHA insurance to refinancetheir cooperative mortgage debt might not be able to do so. The revisionsproposed herein are more technical than substantive in nature and are intendedto remedy this situation. They reflect no new policies of the Departmentbut rather, are designed to carry out existing policy more effectively.The intent of the 1985 revision was to improve the availability of section223(f) mortgage insurance and coinsurance for refinancing existing cooperativeprojects and for financing the purchase of an existing rental project involvingconversion to cooperative ownership. In doing so, reference was made toa ``cooperative mortgagor'', which was described as a nonprofit cooperativeownership housing corporation or nonprofit cooperative ownership housingtrust, <T3>where permanent occupancy of the dwellings is restricted to membersof such corporations or to beneficiaries of such trusts. </T3>This descriptionwas inadvertently carried over from definitions used in HUD's other programsfor cooperative projects (<T3>e.g., </T3>24 CFR Parts 213, 221 and 236). The restrictive nature ofthe italicized language tracks statutory language found in section 213of the National Housing Act. Insurance of mortgages covering existing multifamilyprojects are insured under section 207 of the Act, which contains no suchrestrictive language, rather than section 213. During the development ofhandbook instructions for insurance and coinsurance of existing cooperatives,HUD found that this language could be interpreted in such a way as to rendermany existing cooperative projects ineligible because they contain someunits held by non-occupant owners. To make clear that such projects areeligible, this rule revises andSection; 207.32a(m) of the current regulation.Another potential problem that came to light during dvelopment of handbookinstructions concerns certain limitations on secondary financing underthe existing regulations. The transfer of an individual cooperative unitoften involves financing (share loans) outside of the project mortgagefinancing undertaken by the cooperative (corporation) mortgagor. In manystates, these individual unit or share loans are considered personal propertyloans, as opposed to real property financing, and as such would not presenta problem in terms of the limitations on secondary financing under Parts207 or 255 of HUD's regulations. However, in some states (<T3>e.g., </T3>California and Florida), these loans made to individualcooperative members may be treated as debt against the property (project)and, therefore, the existence of such loans could be in violation of thecurrent program regulations. This rule amends Parts 207 (andSection; 207.32a(J)(6))and 255 (andSection; 255.504(g)) to exclude ``share'' or ``membership'' loansby individual cooperative members from limitations on secondary financingapplicable to the project as a whole.Finally, the rule adds a provision to andSection; 207.32a(d) requiring thatthe maximum mortgage on a cooperative project be based solely on the costto finance the existing indebtedness. (This provision was inadvertentlyomitted in the 1985 revision but appears, correctly, in the current coinsuranceregulation at andSection; 255.203(d)(2).)<ITAG tagnum="84">Procedural Requirements</ITAG>This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291 on Federal Regulation issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. Analysis of the proposed rule indicatesthat it does not:(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) causea major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for publicinspection during regular business hours at the Office of the Rules DocketClerk, Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Department of Housing andUrban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410.The catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 14.135 and14.137.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersignedhereby certifies that this rule would not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. The rule makes it feasible fora limited number of cooperatives to obtain the benefits of FHA mortgageinsurance not otherwise available to them.This rule was listed as item andplusmin; 985 in the Department's SemiannualAgenda of Regulations published on October 24, 1988 (53 FR 41974, 41995)pursuant to Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>24 CFR Part 207Mobile homes, Mortgage insurance, Solar energy.24 CFR Part 255Mortgage insurance, Coinsurance of multifamily mortgages.Accordingly, 24 CFR Parts 207 and 255 are amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 207_MULTIFAMILY HOUSING MORTGAGE INSURANCE</ITAG>1.
