Albersheim, NoisePolicy and Regulatory Branch (AEE-110), Noise Abatement Division, Officeof Environment and Energy, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 IndependenceAve., SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone (202) 267-3560.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Synopsis of the Final Rule</ITAG>Part 36 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 36) contains noisestandards for aircraft type and airworthiness certification. The noisestandards applicable to large transport category airplanes and to turbojetpowered airplanes regardless of category prescribe three broad groups ofnoise levels labelled Stage 1, State 2, and Stage 3, with Stage 1 beingthe noisiest and Stage 3 the quietest. Although Part 36 allows amendmentof airplane type certificates for airplane types and their derivativeswithin a noise stage and to quieter noise stages, it generally does notallow recertification to an increased noise level. Exceptions have beenmade for Stage 2 airplanes which have voluntarily been brought into compliancewith the Stage 3 (quietest) requirements. Since these ``voluntary'' Stage3 airplanes were only required to meet Stage 2, Part 36 currently allowsthem and their derivatives to become Stage 2 airplanes again. The FAA isamending Part 36 to require that airplanes brought into compliance withStage 3 remain within that Stage after the effective date of the rule.Part 91 (14 CFR Part 91) contains the general operating rules applicableto individual airplanes. In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to modify the operatingrules to prohibit aircraft from operating as either a Stage 2 or 3 aircraftat the discretion of the operator. After full consideration of the commentssubmitted to the docket, the FAA has decided that such an amendment toPart 91 would impose a significant cost on affected carriers which wouldnot be balanced by an appreciable reduction in the cumulative noise levels.Accordingly, this final rule does not amend Part 91.Further, these amendments do not affect the definition of ``acousticalchange'' found in andSection; 21.93 of this chapter. Specifically, the 90-dayexclusion from compliance with Part 36 for certain temporary acousticalchanges remains intact. Since temporary changes in type design do not changethe acoustical stage designation of an aircraft, the 90-day exclusion cannotbe used to circumvent the intent of the proposal by permanently increasingthe noise of an aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory History</ITAG>In 1969, the FAA adopted FAR Part 36 to regulate the noise levels of allnewly-designed transport category and jet airplanes. A number of amendmentsto Part 36 have been adopted to expand its applicability to other aircrafttypes and to modified versions of existing aircraft. The FAA has been reducinggradually the allowable noise limits for transport category and jet airplanesby adopting noise limits lower than those adopted in 1969. Currently, FARPart 36 identifies three stages of noise levels, with Stage 1 being thenoisiest and Stage 3 the quietest.In 1976, the FAA adopted Subpart E of Part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulationsto prescribe operating limits for certain U.S.-registered civil subsonicturbojet airplanes with maximum gross takeoff weights greater than 75,000pounds and with standard airworthiness certificates. Those requirementsprohibit the operation, in the United States, of affected airplanes afterspecified dates unless they have been shown to comply with Stage 2 or Stage3 noise limits. Part 91 was amended in 1978 to require all civil supersonicairplanes, except Concordes with flight time before January 1, 1980, tocomply with the Part 36 noise limits in order to operate in the UnitedStates. While Part 36 is designed to gradually tighten the noise standardsfor type certification of aircraft, Part 91 is designed to achieve quieteraircraft operations in the United States by gradually phasing out noisieraircraft.The FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (52 FR 23143; June 17,1987) to amend Parts 36 and 91 to revise both noise certification standardsand operating rules to ensure that airplanes certificated wtihin certainnoise stages would remain within those stages. The proposed rule wouldprohibit any modification of an individual airplane or an airplane typewhich would result in increased noise beyond the limits of an airplane'squietest certificated stage. While the proposed rule would not prohibitmodifications that result in decreased noise, it would prohibit re-modificationof an airplane to return it to its original noise certification level.The proposed rule is in keeping with the FAA's goal of reducing the noiselevels of aircraft operating in the United States. A discussion of docketedcomments on the proposed rule and the disposition of the issues raisedby those comments follows.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>Interested persons were afforded the opportunity to participate in thedevelopment of all aspects of this rulemaking process by submitting writtencomments to the public regulatory docket. The period for submitting commentsclosed September 14, 1987. All comments received have been reviewed andconsidered in the issuance of this final rule.Twelve public comments were received in response to the notice (DocketNo. 25303) with six in favor of adopting the proposed rule and six opposed;all are discussed below.The FAA proposed to amend Parts 36 and 91 to ensure that airplanes certificatedwithin certain noise stages remain within those stages. The FAA believedthat this action was necessary to prevent the return of Stage 3 versionsof Stage 2 airplanes to the noisier Stage 2 levels.Commenters opposed to the amendment stated that the regulation would prohibitindividual airplanes from using Stage 3 certification on an operationalbasis and then returning to the original Stage 2 certification if thatreturn involved only the removal of an approved Stage 3 gross weight orlanding flap limitation. The commenters argued that the proposed rule wouldnot reduce noise levels around airports and, in some cases, could increasethem, since most operators would opt for Stage 2. These commenters concludedthat there is no environmental justification for the proposed rule becauseno benefits could be shown. They also claimed that this rule could significantlyaffect the resale value of any airplanes which had been permanently modifiedto Stage 3. They claimed that the loss of revenue to U.S. operators wouldbe significant, since this rule would prohibit them from operating at maximumcertificated weight if they ever elected to operate their aircraft as Stage3. One carrier claimed that over the life of an aircraft, it would sufferan estimated revenue loss of $550 million; another carrier stated thatit would have incurred a revenue loss of $20 million in 1987 if the proposedrule were in effect.Six commenters favored adoption of the rule. They stated that the rulewould prohibit air carriers that possess airplanes which were certificatedas Stage 3 from sliding back to Stage 2 at their discretion. Such an occurrenceis in direct opposition to the expectation of the residents of communitiessurrounding airports and of airport proprietors that air carriers wouldgradually shift to an all Stage 3 fleet. In addition, these commentersstated that this amendment to Part 36 is in keeping with the intent ofPart 36 and that it effectively prevents erosion of the noise standards.The FAA agrees with the carriers' comments that the cumulative noise impactfrom existing aircraft operating in a dual configuration is negligibleand that the environmental benefit from stopping such operations wouldbe negligible. Based on the FAA's own environmental analysis, there wouldbe no change in the number of people affected by noise at the 65 busiestairports in the United States if carriers that already have aircraft certificatedto operate as either Stage 2 or 3 continue to operate with this type ofcertification. Since the operating restrictions proposed in 1987 have beenwithdrawn, there is no cost impact on carriers operating existing aircraftin a dual configuration. Further, there is no cost impact on the manufacturers,since they have indicated that they have no intention of producing anyStage 2 aircraft in the future. Airplanes not dual certificated for operationas either Stage 2 or 3 by the effective date of this rule will be requiredto remain at Stage 3 airplane after the change in type design. Therefore,those airplanes which do not possess the necessary documentation for Stage2 or 3 operation in their flight manuals may not operate under such dualconfigurations. The FAA's actions are in keeping with Section 611 of theFederal Aviation Act which requires the FAA to prescribe standards forthe measurement of aircraft noise and sonic boom, and the rules and regulationsnecessary to provide for the control and abatement of aircraft noise andsonic boom.<ITAG tagnum="84">Need for the Regulation</ITAG>Generally, Part 36 requires that an individual airplane, once brought intocompliance with the standards of a particular noise stage, remain withinthat stage. Section 36.7(e)(2)(ii) provides that airplanes required tobe type-certificated to Stage 3 must remain at Stage 3. Further, derivativesof a type design must remain within the same stage. However, there aretwo exceptions: (1) Pursuant to andSection; 36.7(e)(2)(i), an airplane ofany stage may be brought into compliance with any quieter stage, and (2)a Stage 2 airplane brought into compliance with Stage 3 standards may presentlybe returned to Stage 2, as may its derivatives.To protect persons affected by airplane noise, the FAA is amending Part36 to bring the Stage 3 acoustical change requirements into conformancewith the requirements for other stages. The FAA believes that this is necessaryto stop the gradual erosion of the noise standard by a multitude of smallmodifications to Stage 3 versions of previously Stage 2 airplanes. Whilethe FAA is unaware of any plans to produce additional Stage 2 versionsof any Stage 3 aircraft, it would be unfair for the FAA to allow the continuationof a regulatory situation under which small changes in weight, engine power,or acoustical treatment could increase the noise levels beyond the Stage3 limit.A similar situation exists concerning other airplanes which, because ofthe type of noise abatement equipment or because of differences in certificatedweights and landing flap configurations, have configurations certificatedto either Stage 2 or Stage 3. Each certificated combination is, under FARParts 21 and 36, a separate configuration. Because the operators of theseairplanes often have a dozen or more configurations available for eachairplane, it is difficult for the FAA, affected airports, and the publicto accurately gauge the noise of an individual airplane. After carefulconsideration of the issue, the FAA has determined that airplanes for whichthis dual certification is in effect on the effective date of this regulationmay continue to operate in this mode. However, no new dual certificationswill be permitted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Change</ITAG>A new andSection; 36.7(e)(3) is added for applications for acoustical changesof Stage 3 airplanes which will require Stage 3 airplane types to remainin compliance with the Stage 3 standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact Evaluation</ITAG>The FAA prepared a regulatory evaluation which is included in the regulatorydocket. The evaluation reviews each proposed change to Part 36. The FAAhas determined that this Final Rule is consistent with the objectives ofExecutive Order 12291 as part of the President's Regulatory Reform Programto reduce regulatory burdens on the public. This amendment imposes no additionalcosts on the Federal government.This amendment benefits the aviation public by simplifying and standardizingthe certification and operational requirements for noise for large transportcategory airplanes and turbojet powered airplanes regardless of category.In addition, the rule is expected to provide several other benefits tothe general public, including an upper limit on the level of noise emissionresulting from modification of airplanes of the same general type.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Determination</ITAG>The FAA has determined that no small entities, as defined by the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, would be affected by the proposed amendments to Part 36.Pursuant to the criteria in FAA Order 2100.14A, September 16, 1986, RegulatoryFlexibility Criteria and Guidance, none of the operators who submittedcomments to the docket is considered a small entity because each operatesmore than nine aircraft. In addition, only two aircraft manufacturers arecurrently producing aircraft which voluntarily meet Stage 3 levels. Eachemploys more than 75 employees and hence is not considered a small entityunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act.Therefore, it is certified that these amendments will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to Department of Transportation ``Policies and Procedures forConsidering Environmental Impacts'' (FAA Order 1050.1D), the FAA has determinedthat the rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, no detailedenvironmental assessment or environmental impact statement was required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications</ITAG>The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>The FAA has determined that this document involves regulations which arenot considered to be major under the procedures and criteria prescribedin Executive Order 12291. The rule is considered significant because ofimportant issues of public policy as it relates to Department of TransportationRegulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). Acopy of the draft evaluation prepared for this action is contained in theregulatory docket. A copy of the evaluation may be obtained from the personidentified in the section entitled <T2>``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.''</T2> For the reasons stated inthe regulatory evaluation, I certify that these regulations, if promulgated,will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. In addition, these proposals, if adopted, would have littleor no impact on trade opportunities for U.S. firms doing business overseasor for foreign firms doing business in the United States.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 36</ITAG>Aircraft, Noise control, Certification.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendments</ITAG>Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration amends Part 36 of theFederal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 36) in part as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 36_NOISE STANDARDS: AIRCRAFT TYPE AND AIRWORTHINESS CERTIFICATION</ITAG>1.
