The intended effect of this action is toexpedite the DOT approval process for fireworks and novelties, and to reducepaperwork and costs in processing applications for approval.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE:</T2> Comments must be received by April 4, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS:</T2> Address comments to Dockets Unit, Office of HazardousMaterials Transportation (DHM-30), U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington,DC 20590.

APA requested that the requirementsfor obtaining approval of certain Class B and C fireworks and Class C noveltiesbe simplified by eliminating the need for the Bureau of Explosives (BOE)or the Bureau of Mines (BOM) to examine these devices if they conform withAPA Standard 87-1. Except for explosives made by or under the directionor supervision of the Department of Energy or the Department of Defenseand certain small arms ammunition, the HMR currently require that all newexplosives, including fireworks and novelties, be examined by the BOE orthe BOM prior to their being classed and approved by the Director, OHMT.In supplementary information submitted in support of the petition, APAstated, in part:<ITAG tagnum="21">Most of the firms in the fireworks industry are very small businesses.The requested changes would therefore be especially beneficial, since theywould greatly simplify the burden and expense of complying with the DOTregulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The DOT regulations presently require that all fireworks be examinedby the Bureau of Explosives [BOE] or other laboratory acceptable to DOTfor the proposed classification. The reports must then be submitted toDOT for approval and assignment of an EX Number. In many cases, firms havehad to wait for several weeks for a report due to a heavy backlog of samplesat the [BOE] Laboratory. Under the proposed procedure the paperwork andtime involved would be eliminated in most cases because information sufficientto classify an item would be submitted directly to DOT. The chemical mixturesthat would be involved have been in use for more than 50 years and theirsafety and stability are well known. A laboratory examination would stillbe required for potentially-unstable or new compositions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, there would be very significant financial benefits forthis small industry. Currently, sample examinations by [BOE] each costbetween $90 and $105. Based on the number of samples examined in the lastthree years, this would amount to a savings of more than $400,000.00, ifthe proposed changes are promulgated.</ITAG>ARA further stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">Also, present regulations prohibit shipment of unclassified fireworks,including samples. It therefore becomes necessary to go through the additionalstep of obtaining a special authorization to even ship a sample to thelaboratory for examination. This, of course, is in addition to the burdenand expense of packaging and shipping the sample itself.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Obviously the requested changes would also reduce the regulatory paperworkrequired of DOT, and expedite the approval process. As stated in our originalsubmission, these changes would in no way compromise the public safetybecause all current safeguards regarding transportation safety would remainunchanged.</ITAG>APA Standard 87-1 contains detailed information on different types of fireworksand novelties, including definitions, descriptions, and drawings of thedifferent devices. It contains descriptions of test procedures and acceptabletest results to be used for evaluating the thermal stability of fireworksand novelties. It also outlines procedures for obtaining DOT approval andthe applicable requirements in Parts 172 and 173 for offering the devicesfor transportation. Those paragraphs contained in APA Standard 87-1 thatare applicable to the transportation of fireworks and novelties are markedwith an asterisk. APA Standard 87-1 contains additional information thatmay alert manufacturers, importers and distributors to the existence ofother Federal, state, and local agencies' requirements applicable to fireworksand novelties. RSPA has reviewed APA Standard 87-1 and believes that itsadoption would enhance uniformity and safety in the construction and transportationof common and special fireworks and novelties. A copy of APA Standard 87-1is available for review in the Dockets Unit.RSPA agrees with the petitioner that it should not be necessary for eachmanufacturer to go through the examination process if the manufacturerproduces fireworks and novelties of a chemical composition and constructionidentified in APA Standard 87-1. Within the past five years, RSPA has classedand approved over 5,000 fireworks and novelties, a number of which wereidentical or similar in chemical composition and construction. Requiringthat these standard devices be repeatedly submitted for examination iscostly and time-consuming for the fireworks industry. Furthermore, suchexaminations offer little or no additional safety benefits to the public.RSPA believes that adoption of APA Standard 87-1 would provide an equivalentlevel of safety for classifying and approving fireworks and novelties whilesignificantly reducing the regulatory burden of the fireworks industry.Therefore, RSPA is proposing to incorporate APA Standard 87-1 by reference.As proposed, the Director, OHMT would continue to approve finished fireworksand novelties, but an examination by the BOE or the BOM would not be requiredif the devices conform with APA Standard 87-1, and the manufacturer certifiessuch compliance in his application. At his discretion, the Director, OHMTmay require examination of a device if he has reason to believe that anexamination is necessary; for example, when insufficient information hasbeen submitted to support proper classification of a device or to determineits safety in transportation.This proposed change would only apply to fireworks and novelties. The chemicalmixtures identified in APA Standard 87-1 have been in use for more than50 years and the safety and stability of these mixtures are well known.For other types of explosives, other than certain types of small arms ammunition,manufacturers would continue to submit each new explosive compound, mixtureor device for examination and approval even though it may appear to bethe same product as that submitted for examination and approval by anotherfacility.<ITAG tagnum="84">Review by Section</ITAG><T3>Section 171.7. </T3>APA's mailing address would be added under paragraph(c)(33), and APA Standard 87-1 would be incorporated by reference underparagraph (d)(29).<T3>Section 171.8. </T3>A definition for ``EX number'' would be added.The EX number would be assigned by the Director, OHMT, and would be usedto provide better identification of explosives.<T3>Section 173.86. </T3>Requirements for approval of new explosives arecontained in andSection;173.86. Paragraph (b) would be revised to indicatethat there are exceptions to the requirement for examination of explosivesand for clarity. The latest edition of the Explosives Hazard ClassificationProcedures contained in DOD TB 700-2 also would be referenced in paragraph(b).New paragraph (j) would contain the requirements applicable to the examinationof fireworks and novelties. Under these provisions, a manufacturer of afirework or novelty produced in conformance with APA Standard 87-1 maysubmit a written application to the Director, OHMT, containing the informationoutlined in the APA Standard. This information would include a detaileddescription of the device, including shape, size and a diagram showinglocation of the explosive components; the chemical composition, includinga list of formulas; and the test results for thermal stability. The applicantwould also indicate the DOT hazard classification sought for the device.If the Director, OHMT, determines that an application contains adequatejustification to support that a device is satisfactory for transportation,the applicant would be sent a letter of approval. At his discretion theDirector, OHMT may require that a device be examined by the BOE or theBOM. Of course, for a device containing chemicals not addressed by APAStandard 87-1, the applicant would submit a report of examination by theBOE or BOM for each component contained within the device, as is presentlyrequired by andSection;173.86(b).Also, a requirement that packages of fireworks and novelties be markedwith the ``EX number'' assigned by the Director, OHMT, would be added underparagraphs (j)(1)(ii) and (j)(1)(iii). RSPA believes this notation willhelp to alert carriers transporting the devices and enforcement personnelthat the devices being shipped have been approved for transportation underandSection;173.86. Because of the importance of such identification, notonly for fireworks and novelties but for all explosives, RSPA plans topropose under a separate rulemaking action that the EX number be markedon all packages containing explosives and all shipping papers coveringshipments of explosives. Many shippers are presently following this practice,even though it is not required in the HMR.<T3>Sections 173.88 and 173.100. </T3>Various paragraphs in these sectionswould be removed or revised to eliminate unnecessary duplication with APAStandard 87-1. In andSection;173.88, paragraph (d) which contains a definitionof Class B special fireworks would be revised to reference the definitionsin APA Standard 87-1. A similar change would be made in andSection;173.100(r) which defines Class C common fireworks. Paragraphs (t) and (x) of andSection;173.100containing definitions of certain Class C novelties would be removed andreserved. Paragraph (u), in andSection;173.100, would be amended by removingthe referenced to a ``toy smoke device'' which is a novelty covered inthe standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Notices</ITAG>Executive Order 12291Based on limited information available concerning size and nature of entitieslikely to be affected, I certify that the proposed regulations will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. RSPA has furtherdetermined that this rulemaking (1) is not ``major'' under Executive Order12291. (2) is not ``significant'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures[42 FR 11034; February 26, 1979]; (3) will not affect not-for-profit enterprises,or small governmental jurisdictions; and (4) does not require an environmentalimpact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act [49 U.S.C.4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>].
