All comments received were from Federal agencies withthe exception of one comment from a State agency. The ACFR has analyzedall the comments and based on them, has made several changes to the regulationsas proposed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Availability of Office of the Federal Register Publications </ITAG>No comments were received on the ACFR's proposed consolidation and updatingof regulations concerning availability of OFR publications.The Federal Register Act gives the ACFR the authority to regulate the numberof copies of OFR publications to be distributed without charge to membersof the Government for official use and to be made available for purchaseby the public. (44 U.S.C. 1506) The ACFR is amending its regulations by consolidating all information onthe availability of OFR publications in a new Subchapter D consisting oftwo parts, Parts 11 and 12. Information on subscriptions and official distributionwithin the Federal Government is presently dispersed throughout Chapter1, with information located in 1 CFR 3.4, 1 CFR Part 7, 1 CFR 8.8, 1 CFR9.3, 1 CFR 10.4, and 1 CFR 10.14. The consolidation of all regulations concerning the availability of OFRpublications provides a central, convenient source of information for usersof OFR publications. Additionally, future revision of these consolidatedregulations is simplified. Some of the regulations consolidated in Subchapter D are out-of-date. TheACFR, therefore, revises these regulations. The regulations are also restructuredand reworded for consistency. Since several OFR publications are now availablein paper, microfiche, and magnetic tape forms, some of the regulationsare clarified to identify the specific form to which the text applies.Also, present regulations provide that various OFR publications are distributedin the number needed, without charge to members of the Government for officialuse. The provision of these copies is based on a written request to theDirector of the Federal Register, therefore, this procedure is includedwhen applicable. The availability of the slip laws and the U.S. Statutes at Large is notcontrolled by the ACFR and therefore information on their availabilityis not included in the new Part 11. In addition to paper and microfiche,the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), and TheUnited States Government Manual, are now available in magnetic tapes. Thecurrent prices and availability of these magnetic tapes are added in thenew Part 11. The monthly Federal Register Index and the LSA (List of CFR Sections Affected)are included with each <T4>Federal Register</T4> subscription and each official distribution.Statements to this effect have been added in the new andSection;andSection;11.2 and 12.1(e). Additionally, the monthly Federal Register Index andLSA are available as separate subscriptions. A regulation on subscriptionto the LSA is added at andSection; 11.8. A regulation on subscription tothe monthly Federal Register Index is redesignated from andSection; 3.4(b)(8)to andSection; 11.8. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulations Affected by Court Decision or Act of Congress </ITAG>The ACFR proposed andSection; 8.10 to emphasize the requirement that agenciespublish documents in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> when their regulations are affected by a courtdecision or an Act of Congress. The Federal Register Act at 44 U.S.C. 1510requires that the CFR contain agency regulations having general applicabilityand legal effect that are relied upon by the agency in the discharge ofits functions and are in effect as of certain dates specified by the ACFR.Section 1510(e) specifically contemplates a system wherein agencies publishdocuments in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, as necessary, to amend the CFR. The CFR togetherwith these documents are prima facie evidence of the text of the regulationsand the fact that they are in effect on and after the revision date ofthe CFR volume.Although agency commenters acknowledged their responsibility for keepingtheir regulations current, proposed andSection; 8.10 created a great dealof confusion as to how to comply with the rule in various fact situationsthat may arise.In view of the agencies' difficulties in interpreting the proposed andSection;8.10, the ACFR believes it may not be appropriate to set out a generalrule that would be applicable to widely varying facts and circumstancessurrounding particular court decisions and statutes. Moreover, proposedandSection; 8.10 is somewhat redundant in view of the fact that the ACFRis amending andSection; 8.1 to more precisely mirror the language of 44 U.S.C.1510 providing that the CFR contain regulations having legal effect. Asdiscussed previously, the requirement that the CFR contain documents havinglegal effect places responsibility on each agency to expeditiously amendits regulations whenever the regulations are rendered ineffective in wholeor in part by a court decision or an Act of Congress.<ITAG tagnum="84">Filing for Public Inspection and Publication Schedules</ITAG>The Federal Register Act of 1935 provides for an official publication calledthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> in which all rules and regulations of Federalagencies shall systematically and uniformly be published. Under that Act,the ACFR is charged with regulating the ``manner and form'' in which the<T4>Federal Register</T4> shall be printed. (44 U.S.C. 1506(3)).The ACFR provides a regular schedule for filing for public inspection and<T4>Federal Register</T4> publication in 1 CFR 17.2. Section 17.2(a) presentlyprovides that receipt of a document by the OFR in the ordinary course ofbusiness (8:45 a.m.-5:15 p.m.) is considered to be a request for filingfor public inspection and publication on the regular schedule, that is,3 working days later.Before a document can be scheduled for filing for public inspection andpublication, it must be reviewed to ensure that it meets publication requirementsset out in 1 CFR Chapters I and II. When documents are submitted late inthe afternoon, the amount of time available for processing is severelydecreased. As long as the number of documents submitted late in the daywas small, this did not pose a problem for the printing and overall productionof the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Experience now shows, however, that so manydocuments are being submitted late in the afternoon that assigning the3-day publication schedule for documents received late in the day is notpractical and does not allow efficient use of editorial and printing staffresources.This rule changes the deadline for receiving documents for filing for publicinspection and publication on the regular 3-day schedule to 2:00 p.m. Documentsreceived after 2:00 p.m. receive the next working day's regular filingfor public inspection and publication schedule. The 2:00 p.m. deadlinegreatly improves the situation created by a large number of documents submittedlate in the afternoon and allows for a more efficient production process.One commenter suggested changing the 2:00 p.m. deadline for receiving documentsfor publication on the regular 3-day schedule to a later cutoff time inorder to accommodate the use of agency shuttles after lunchtime. The ACFRcannot move the deadline back and still ensure that the OFR has adequatetime for processing documents. While the Administrative Committee recognizes that requiring receipt ofdocuments by 2:00 p.m. to qualify for OFR's regular schedule may necessitatecertain agency administrative adjustments, it believes that the overallbenefits justify this change. Emergency processing of documents will continueto be offered as provided in 1 CFR 17.3 and new andSection;andSection; 17.5and 17.6.One commenter expressed concern that the 2:00 p.m. deadline for receivingdocuments for the regular 3-day schedule might change the OFR's currentpractice on ``emergency filings''. The commenter urged that this currentpractice on emergency filings be codified in 1 CFR 17.2. The commenterfurther suggested that the provision that a document is filed only afterit has been received, processed and assigned a publication date be includedin 1 CFR 17.2.The part heading for Part 17 has been revised to read ``Filing for PublicInspection and Publication Schedules'' and several sections in the parthave been revised to clarify the difference between the regular and emergencyschedules for filing for public inspection and the regular and emergencyschedules for publication.In response to the commenters' suggestions, a new paragraph is added toandSection; 17.2 stating that each document received shall be filed for publicinspection only after it has been received, processed and assigned a publicationdate. Also, language is added to clarify that the section provides forboth the regular schedule for filing for public inspection and the regularschedule for publication.New andSection;andSection; 17.5 and 17.6 are added to codify the OFR's currentpractice on emergency filing for public inspection.If an agency wishes to provide immediate notice to the public of a document'scontents, the agency may request immediate processing and filing for publicinspection. This is known as emergency filing for public inspection. Adocument may be filed for public inspection on the same day it is receivedif there is sufficient time for the document to be both processed and assigneda publication date by the OFR staff and inspected by the public. The documentremains on public inspection until it is published according to eitherthe regular or deferred schedule.The ACFR has not provided in regulations for a regular schedule for SunshineAct documents in the past, although the OFR has historically afforded thesedocuments an expedited schedule. This rule formalizes the OFR's longstandingpolicy of assigning a 2-day schedule for each correctly submitted noticeof meeting issued under the ``Government in the Sunshine Act'' (5 U.S.C.522b(e)(3)). In accordance with the OFR's existing policy, each SunshineAct document received before 4:00 p.m. is scheduled to be published 2 workingdays later. Each document received after 4:00 p.m. is scheduled to be published3 working days later.Sunshine Act documents are published in a separate section of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> under simplified formatting requirements. Thissimplified format allows an agency to present statutorily required informationin a clear and efficient manner while providing public notice as quicklyas possible. The OFR's abbreviated 2-day schedule is available becausethe simple, standardized format permits quicker processing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reinstatement of Expired Regulations</ITAG>Section 18.16 is added to provide that agencies may reinstate regulationsremoved from the CFR data base which have expired by their own terms onlyby republishing the regulations in full text in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. This rule is necessary to enable OFR to maintaina more current CFR data base and to promote an orderly system of codification.The addition of this rule was prompted by agency requests seeking to extendthe effective dates of rules after they have expired by their own termsbut prior to the annual revision date of the agency's CFR title, with theaim of avoiding republication of reinstated rules in full text in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.However ill-advised this method of reinstating rules is in terms of goodrulemaking practice, the ACFR finds that, as a practical matter, it isnot possible for agencies to rely on the revision date of the CFR titleaffected as the deadline for retroactively reinstating expired rules. Thetendency of some agencies to fall back on CFR revision dates as a lastresort for reviving regulations conflicts with OFR's procedures for updatingthe CFR.Under the Federal Register Act, 44 U.S.C. 1510(c), the ACFR is authorizedto regulate the codification of the CFR with a view to keeping the Codeas current as practicable. In order to compile and issue revised editionsof the CFR in a timely fashion, the OFR must update the CFR data base ona regular, if not daily basis. Once defunct regulations are removed fromthe data base, the only practical means of reinstating them is to republishthem in full in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.As originally proposed, andSection; 18.16 contemplated a complete ban onretroactive reinstatement of expired regulations. The ACFR continues tohold that good rulemaking practice calls for expired regulations to berepublished in full. However, the ACFR recognizes that in those instancesin which it is still possible for text to be retrieved from the CFR database, the decision of whether to reinstate regulations by retroactive amendmentor by full text republication is best left to the discretion of the individualagency.Commenters who cited the annual revision date of the CFR title affectedas the appropriate termination point for reinstating expired regulationsshould be aware that the CFR data base is subject to continuous updatingto keep pace with changes in Federal regulations. It is the status of thetext in the regularly updated data base at any given time that determineswhether an expired rule may be reinstated, rather than the revision dateof the CFR title. This procedure is necessary to ensure that new revisionsof the CFR are delivered on a prompt basis.Commenters should also bear in mind that the once yearly revision of theCFR is a minimum standard. The ACFR proposed andSection; 18.16 to accommodatethe prospect that the CFR may be made available in a more frequently updatedform in the future. As originally proposed, andSection; 18.16 did not define the term ``expired''within the regulatory text. Several commenters were confused as to thetype of expired material to which andSection; 18.16 applies. To clarify thefocus of andSection; 18.16, the ACFR modified the rule language to limitthe application of andSection; 18.16 to regulations which have ``expiredby their own terms''. With this modification it should be clear that andSection;18.16 narrowly applies to rules of expressly limited duration which haveexpired under the terms set out in the effective dates section of the preambleor in the text of the rule itself.Another misperception among commenters relates to rules which are currentlybeing enforced but only have application with respect to past years. Forexample: the IRS retains rules in the CFR applicable to obligations andliabilities arising in past tax years; the Federal Crop Insurance Corporationcarries rules relating to past crop years; the Health Care Financing Administrationhas regulations concerning Medicare and Medicaid benefits and paymentswhich are applicable within various time periods; and the National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration retains safety and fuel economy rules relatingto a number of past model years.These types of currently enforceable rules having prior application periodsare not rules of expressly limited duration as contemplated by andSection;18.16. Agencies may continue to carry rules such as these in the CFR.Another commenter opposed prompt removal of expired regulations from theCFR data base on the basis that removal should only be made at the agency'sinitiative. The ACFR points out that OFR does not remove regulations onits own initiative. Section 18.16 refers to regulations of expressly limitedduration that have expired by their own terms. Removal of such regulationsis self-executing in the sense that when the OFR finds it necessary todelete such material from the CFR data base, it is simply carrying outan agency's original instructions. These instructions are found in theeffective dates section of the preamble or in text of the rule itself.It should be noted that andSection; 21.6 already requires agencies to submitnotification by document for publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> when a codified regulation expires. Althoughthe procedure for removal under andSection; 21.6 might seem to be inconsistentwith the procedure inherent in andSection; 18.16, in practice, OFR will onlyimplement an agency's original removal instructions as a last resort whenthe agency has failed to submit timely notification as required by andSection;21.6. The ACFR views these two procedures not as contradictory provisions,but rather as a necessary redundancy to ensure that the FR/CFR publicationsystem is currently updated. While the addition of andSection; 18.16 willenable the OFR to work toward a more current data base, the ACFR stressesthat it continues to be the agencies' responsibility to follow andSection;21.16 to keep the CFR current.Several commenters objected to andSection; 18.16 by citing the expense ofrepublication. The ACFR acknowledges that its requirement of full textrepublication could result in higher printing costs in some cases. However,such costs are largely avoidable when agencies monitor their regulationsand make timely amendments.Some commenters noted that there are circumstances in which it is not possiblefor an agency to amend its regulations until after the expiration datehas passed. To address this concern as well as cost considerations citedabove, the ACFR modified andSection; 18.16 to require that agencies republishexpired regulations in full text when the OFR has in fact deleted the regulationsfrom the CFR data base. Agencies should consult with the OFR to determinethe status of the text of regulations being reinstated. This should bedone before the reinstatement document is submitted to agency officialsfor clearance and signature.Even though under the new andSection; 18.16 avoidance of full text republicationmay still be possible in some instances, the ACFR continues to stronglyrecommend that agencies publish rules in full when reinstating expiredregulations. This procedure unambiguously satisfies the legal requirementsfor rulemaking and is clearly the most convenient for users of the FR/CFRpublication system.One commenter raised the issue of court ordered stays affecting regulationsthat are due to expire. The commenter correctly pointed out that OFR wouldnot necessarily be aware of such court orders. The ACFR responds by notingthat it is the responsibility of the agency to keep OFR informed. [See1 CFR 18.17(c).] There should be no difficulty in preserving stayed regulationsin the data base if agencies are conscientious in alerting OFR.Finally, one commenter requested clarification as to whether a documentthat republishes reinstated rules in full should be a proposed or finalrule. The extent to which the notice and comment provisions of the APA,5 U.S.C. 551 <T3>et seq</T3>., apply to reinstated rules is a question that is withinthe individual agency's discretion to determine.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Dates and Time Periods </ITAG>In 1 CFR 18.17, paragraph (a) is revised in accordance with the OFR's currentpractice, to reflect the fact that many agencies now rely on computed dates.The ACFR no longer expresses a preference for documents setting forth datescertain over documents setting forth time periods measured by a certainnumber of days after publication. One commenter suggested that the ACFR revise 1 CFR 18.17(a) by using thewords ``rule document'' rather than ``document'' and ``shall'' rather than``should''. The ACFR does not agree with either suggestion. Paragraph (a)applies not only to rule but also proposed rule and notice documents whichcontain either a date certain or a time period measured by a certain numberof days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.Paragraph (a) does not require a specific date or time period measuredby a certain number of days after publication, because such a requirementwould be inconsistent with the fact that some effective dates are dependentupon Congressional action. Thus, the term ``shall'' is not appropriate.The ACFR received 5 comments on paragraph 18.17(c) which would requirean agency to promptly publish a document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> announcing an effective date in the event anact of Congress or court decision establishes or changes the effectivedate of an agency's regulation.One commenter wanted a clarification of the term ``court''. The word ``Federal''has been added to make that clarification.Two commenters were concerned about publishing a document prior to a finaldetermination by a court of last resort. To meet this concern, the word``dispositive'' has been added to the regulation.One commenter was concerned that the regulation would be inconsistent withthe notice and comment requirements of the APA, 5 U.S.C. 553. This ruleis not inconsistent with the APA. The documents required to be publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> under 1 CFR 18.17 are ones in which there isno discretion on the part of the agency and therefore nothing for the publicto comment on in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553.The responsibility for keeping agency regulations current and consistentwith relevant acts of Congress and court orders rests with each agency.The APA requires that agencies provide notice of rulemaking by means ofpublication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The ACFR takes the position that notice of achange to a regulation's effective date is an integral element of any rulemaking.Therefore, any change to an effective date due to act of Congress or courtorder should be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.Another commenter pointed out that not only acts of Congress but also Congressionalaction can establish an effective date. For example, some agencies mustsubmit their regulations for Congressional review for a specified periodof time based on days Congress is in session. The regulation has been expandedto also include Congressional action.The OFR has received agency rulemaking documents that contained effectivedates dependent upon Congressional action. Additionally, court orders oracts of Congress occasionally establish or change the effective date ofan agency's regulation. In either of these instances, the public is onlymade aware of the changes in effective dates in a timely, convenient mannerif the agency publishes a <T4>Federal Register</T4> document. Clearly the public has an interestin knowing the date on which compliance with agency regulations becomesmandatory. In most cases, the public can rely on the FR/CFR system to supplythe effective date for any regulation. In the past, the OFR has received a few agency documents, which containedboth an effective date dependent upon Congressional action and languageto the effect that persons interested in the effective date of the regulationsshould call the agency's contact person. Such an added burden upon theregulated public is unhelpful and unnecessary when <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication is available and required as thesource of legal notice of rulemaking by the APA. Furthermore, a practical consideration includes the burden such a vagueeffective date places on OFR editors updating the annual CFR volumes. Whenagency documents refer the public to the agency for a regulation's effectivedate, OFR editors must call the agency to discover the status of each suchregulation prior to updating the yearly revision of the CFR volumes. Thus,the OFR as well as the public, must go outside the FR/CFR system to discoverthe current status of these regulations. A second consideration is the ACFR's goal to improve Federal agencies'access to the most current text of the CFR. In order to implement thisgoal and maintain an orderly scheme of codification, the OFR editors mustknow the effective date of each regulation. This regulation satisfies the legal requirements for rulemaking, relievesa presently existing burden on the public, helps maintain an orderly systemof codification, and is compatible with ACFR's plans to fully implementa currently maintained data base. For these reasons, the ACFR amends 1CFR 18.17 by adding a new paragraph (c) to require that an agency promptlypublish a document in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> announcing the effective date in the event aneffective date is dependent upon Congressional action, or an act of Congressor a dispositive Federal court decision establishes or changes the effectivedate of an agency regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Updating Regulations </ITAG>The ACFR has the statutory responsibility for maintaining the entire FR/CFRpublication system and preserving its practical usefulness. This governmentwideresponsibility requires that the ACFR issue regulations that will ensureand facilitate access to Government documents.Some of the regulations in 1 CFR are simply out-of-date. The ACFR, therefore,is removing or amending these regulations to reflect current publicationprocedures. The ACFR received several comments supporting the proposal to update itsregulations and expressing appreciation to the OFR staff for its documentdrafting and reviewing services. Through this consultative process, theOFR staff will continue to work with agencies to resolve their documentdrafting problems.The ACFR makes a nomenclature change in 1 CFR 2.3. The change correctsthe name of the OFR's parent agency to the National Archives and RecordsAdministration. Some of the regulations in 1 CFR are gender specific. Sections that containgender specific terminology, 1 CFR 2.4, 1 CFR 5.3, 1 CFR 9.1, 1 CFR 16.2,1 CFR 16.3, 1 CFR 16.4, 1 CFR 17.4, 1 CFR 18.7, 1 CFR 20.1, 1 CFR 21.14,and 1 CFR 21.42 are amended to eliminate gender specification. The title of ``The United States Government Manual'' is corrected in 1CFR 2.5, 1 CFR 9.1, the Part heading of 1 CFR Part 20, and 1 CFR 20.1.Also, the ``Federal Register Index'' and the ``LSA (List of CFR SectionsAffected)'' are added to the list of publications in paragraph (c) of 1CFR 2.5.The ACFR makes minor technical changes to 1 CFR 3.2 and to the sectionheading of 1 CFR 3.3. One commenter suggested that the word ``filed'' in1 CFR 3.2(b) be replaced with the word ``available''. The ACFR definesthe word ``filing'' in andSection; 1.1 of its regulations as ``making a documentavailable for public inspection at the Office of the Federal Register .. .''. The addition of the phrase ``for public inspection'' after the word``filed'' or ``filing'' in 1 CFR 5.2, 5.3, and 18.4 is consistent withthe ACFR's use of the word ``filing'' throughout its regulations. The ACFRhas clarified the usage of the term ``filing'' under the Federal RegisterAct and will not adopt the commenter's suggested language change as thesuggested language could result in confusion.The regulations at 1 CFR 5.2 and 5.3 are clarified by adding the phrase``filed for public inspection'' in place of the word ``filed'' in accordancewith the language and content of 44 U.S.C. 1503. 1 CFR 5.6 is also clarified.The categories of documents listed in 1 CFR 5.9 are clarified and expandedwhen necessary to reflect the current publication requirements of the ACFR.One commenter suggested that including ``general policy statements'' inthe rules and regulations category of 1 CFR 5.9(b) is misleading sincepolicy statements that are not related to any rule and do not have generalapplicability and legal effect appear in the notices category. The ACFRhas therefore clarified paragraph (b) to include ``general policy statementsconcerning regulations''.Another commenter asked why temporary and interim rules are not publishedin the CFR or listed as rule category documents in 1 CFR 5.9. The ACFRregards all permanent, temporary and interim rules simply as ``rules''under section 5.9, publishes them in the rules category of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and codifies them in the CFR if the rules arein effect as of the revision date of the CFR title affected.In 1 CFR 6.5, the term ``index-digests'' is changed to ``indexes, digests''and the section is clarified. The OFR publishes both indexes and digests,but not index-digests. The term ``general applicability and current or future effect'' is changedto ``general applicability and legal effect'' in 1 CFR 8.1. This changeadopts the language used in 44 U.S.C. 1505 and is consistent with the ACFR'slanguage in 1 CFR 5.2. The language in paragraph (c) of 1 CFR 8.3 is clarified. The Code of Federal Regulations Index now contains the parallel tablesof authorities and rules described in 1 CFR 8.5. The ACFR is updating andclarifying this section to reflect current practice. The ACFR is clarifying the section heading of 1 CFR 15.4. This section'stext pertains to the reproduction and certification of copies of acts anddocuments. The ACFR is removing 1 CFR 15.5. Information on the availability of OFRpublications controlled by the ACFR has been consolidated in the new SubchapterD. The availability of the slip laws and the U.S. Statutes at Large isnot controlled by the ACFR and, therefore, reference to their availabilityis removed. An addition to 1 CFR 16.2 provides that agency liaison officers shall beavailable to discuss documents submitted for publication with the OFR editors.This provision emphasizes the importance the ACFR places on this aspectof the liaison officer's duties. The word ``agency'' is added to the text for identification purposes in1 CFR 16.2, 16.3, and 16.4. The OFR's procedures require each agency requesting publication on theemergency schedule to submit its request by letter. Therefore, 1 CFR 17.4is revised to reflect this procedure by removing the phrase ``if time permits''.The services provided in 1 CFR 17.5 in conjunction with the transmittalof documents by telecommunication are no longer needed due to the availabilityof expedited mail services. Therefore, this section is removed. The term ``unusual tabulations'' in 1 CFR 17.6, is changed to ``unusualor lengthy tables''. Additionally, a provision that the OFR staff willnotify an agency if its document must be assigned to a deferred scheduleis added to andSection; 17.6 to reflect the OFR's current notification procedure.The regulation on submission of an original document and copies at 1 CFR18.1 needs clarification and correction. The provision for documents printedon both sides in andSection; 18.1 does not reflect the current OFR practice.The ACFR is amending andSection; 18.1 to require that if an agency submitsa document printed on both sides, one of the copies sent by the agencymust be a collated, single-sided copy. Additionally, due to the availabilityof expedited mail services, paragraph (b) is out-of-date and is removed.The footnote to 1 CFR 18.1 is revised and updated. The footnote's referenceto a 1972 document is removed because it is outdated. The Director of the Federal Register's policy on combined category documentsis clarified in the revision of 1 CFR 18.2. Some of the regulations in 1 CFR include the term ``rulemaking'' as twowords. The sections in the regulations that have rulemaking printed astwo words, 1 CFR 18.2, 1 CFR 18.4, and 1 CFR 22.5, are revised to a oneword spelling. In 1 CFR 18.3, a new paragraph (c) is added to clarify that receipt datesof documents are determined at the time a signed original and clear andlegible copies are received. Additionally, the ACFR is amending andSection;18.3(a) by removing the obsolete option of filing with the AdministrativeCommittee. A revision of 1 CFR 18.4 clarifies certain OFR format requirements. Paragraph(a), containing the format requirements for margins and page size, is removed.The OFR's Document Drafting Handbook is the proper source of technicaland editorial information concerning OFR's drafting requirements. Additionally,language is added to 1 CFR 18.4 to reflect the fact that the OFR does notaccept press releases for publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The ACFR revises and makes minor technical changes to 1 CFR 18.5. Obsoletecopying procedures are deleted and paragraph (c) is revised and redesignatedmore appropriately as 1 CFR 18.3(c). An existing incomplete sentence is revised in 1 CFR 18.6. The ACFR revises 1 CFR 18.9 to require that documents conform to the currentedition of the U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual in all mattersof style. The Style Manual is intended to facilitate Government printingand ensure editorial quality. One commenter suggested that an edition datebe set out in the regulation. By act of Congress, the Public Printer isauthorized to determine the form and style of Government printing. Dueto its official status, no confusion results from specifying that the mostcurrent edition be used.Material on forms is included in 1 CFR 18.10. Paragraph (a) is clarifiedto reflect that a clear and legible original form or illustration, or aclear and completely legible reproduction shall be included in the originaldocument and each certified copy when it is necessary to publish a formor illustration. The OFR finds that original forms are often needed inthe publication process. Copies of forms occasionally are not completelylegible due to the small print used for some portions of the forms.Obsolete material in andSection; 18.10 is removed and a new provision isadded in paragraph (b) to provide that documents containing tabular materialmay be assigned to the deferred publication schedule. One commenter suggestedthat paragraph (b) be revised to indicate that ``unusual or lengthy'' tabularmaterial may be assigned to the deferred publication schedule. This suggestionis not adopted since paragraph (b) references andSection; 17.6 and this languageis included in andSection; 17.6.The ACFR removes 1 CFR 18.11 because it does not reflect the OFR's currentpractice. The language in 1 CFR 18.12 is revised and simplified. One commenter suggestedthat the proposed revision of the introductory text of 1 CFR 18.12(c) couldresult in agency documents that do not adequately disclose the basis ofrules or respond to public comments. It is the responsibility of each agencyto issue documents in accordance with the requirements of the APA and applicablecase law. The ACFR's use of the word ``may'' ensures that each agency hasdiscretion to fulfill the requirements of the APA as it sees fit.Material reflecting the OFR's current procedures for the correction oferrors in documents is included in 1 CFR 18.13. A new paragraph (b) isadded reflecting the OFR's procedures for filing for public inspectionand ultimate retention of revoking or correcting letters. Two comments were received on proposed 1 CFR 18.13. One commenter requestedfurther guidance on use of correction letters and clarification of paragraph(a). Paragraph (a) has been revised to reflect the OFR's current policythat minor corrections may be made to documents filed for public inspection,but not yet published, with a timely agency letter. Extensive corrections,however, may require agency withdrawal of the document from the publicationschedule in order to prepare the correction. The decision as to when changesnecessitate withdrawal of a document from a publication schedule is a productiondetermination that is made by the OFR staff.Another commenter asked how long the withdrawing or correcting letter mentionedin 1 CFR 18.13 will be retained by the OFR. Each letter received underandSection; 18.13 will be attached to the document it affects and retainedas long as that document is retained. The prescribed retention schedulesfor rules, proposed rules and notices are fifteen years, five years andone year, respectively.The ACFR has also replaced the word ``revoking'' with ``withdrawing'' inandSection; 18.13 for consistency with the section heading.The ACFR removes 1 CFR 18.14 because it does not reflect the OFR's currentprocedures for correction of errors in documents. One commenter was confusedby the removal of 1 CFR 18.14 and requested that a new regulation set forththe OFR's current procedures for the correction of errors in documents.This had already been accomplished in andSection; 18.13.The ACFR is removing superannuated material from 1 CFR 18.20. Provisionsfor agency actions by December 31, 1981, and April 1, 1982, are no longercurrent and are removed. Part 19, which is based upon two Executive orders, has been amended byE.O. 12080. The ACFR revises the current authority citation for Part 19and 1 CFR 19.4 to reflect the addition of this Executive order. The ACFRalso adds an informational footnote on the availability of the publication``Specifications for Descriptions of Tracts of Land for Use in ExecutiveOrders and Proclamations'' to 1 CFR 19.1. The text of 1 CFR 20.1 is restructured. In 1 CFR 20.3, the ACFR removes the language requiring submission of chartsin duplicate and clarifies other language in this section. It is not theOFR's current practice to require submission of charts in duplicate. To avoid unnecessary duplication, a phrase is added to 1 CFR 20.4 providingthat descriptions of administrative units common to most agencies willnot be accepted for publication in The United States Government Manual.In order to reflect current OFR procedures, 1 CFR 21.1 is revised to requireeach agency that prepares a document subject to codification to includewords of issuance and amendatory language describing the precise relationshipof the new provisions to the CFR. The ACFR removes 1 CFR 21.4 and 1 CFR 21.15. Neither section reflects theOFR's current procedures. It is the practice of the OFR to accept an agency document that amendsmore than one title, or more than one chapter of the CFR. Therefore, theACFR removes 1 CFR 21.5. The text of 1 CFR 21.6 is restructured and language is added to clarifythe OFR's requirement that agencies must notify the OFR of the expirationof codified material by document for publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The ACFR is adding a new paragraph (c) to 1 CFR 21.8 to clarify that chapterand subchapter assignments are made by the OFR, not by the agency. Twocommenters suggested that 1 CFR 21.8(c) be revised to state that chapterand subchapter assignments are made by the OFR after agency consultation.The ACFR concurs. The OFR is responsive to agency needs and has alwaysand will continue to consult with appropriate agency personnel prior tomaking chapter and subchapter assignments.In 1 CFR 21.11, the standard organization of the CFR is revised to includea new example of paragraph designations.The reservation of numbers at the end of related parts or sections to allowfor future expansion is an agency option. Therefore, the ACFR revises theobsolete requirement for agency reservation of numbers at 1 CFR 21.12 andmakes the reservation of numbers optional. The ACFR is removing 1 CFR 21.13 because it is not consistent with currentOFR guidance to agencies. The ACFR is moving the provision dealing with deviations from the standarddesignations from its proposed location in 1 CFR 21.11(b) to 1 CFR 21.14(a).Section 21.14 has an existing provision for deviation from standard CFRdesignations and is revised to include a thorough description of when deviationsfrom standard CFR designation will be permitted.The ACFR received several comments about proposed andSection; 21.11(b) prohibitingdeviations from standard CFR designations unless approved in advance bythe OFR. Many commenters asked for a more detailed explanation of thissection, particularly whether existing numbering deviations in agency regulationswould be permitted to remain in the CFR.The ACFR is not requiring agencies to reach back and rewrite regulationsalready in the CFR. However, the ACFR is limiting future numbering deviationsby permitting them subject to the prior approval of the OFR. Approval mustbe requested for all final rule documents that contain unusual numbering,including any documents that amend existing regulations that contain unusualnumbering.In response to commenter's requests for clarification, the ACFR is addinga description of the procedure agencies should follow when requesting approvalof a deviation from standard CFR designations.The table of contents in a document must list appendix headings to thepart or subpart in addition to headings for the subparts, undesignatedcenter headings and sections in the part as described in 1 CFR 21.18. TheACFR is updating 1 CFR 21.18 by adding appendix headings to the part orsubpart to the list of items that shall appear in the table of contents.This revision reflects the OFR's current practice. The ACFR removes 1 CFR 21.22. One commenter suggested that 1 CFR 21.4,21.13, 21.15 and 21.22 be revised rather than removed. These sections nolonger reflect the OFR's current editorial and technical procedures andare removed. The ACFR is working towards separating out purely editorialand technical instructions from its regulations. The OFR's functional DocumentDrafting Handbook is the proper source for nonregulatory document draftingguidance to agencies.The regulation concerning placing and amending authority citations, 1 CFR21.43, is clarified and corrected to include the provision that the authoritycitation shall appear at the end of the table of contents for a part orafter each subpart heading within the text of a part.The ACFR also clarifies 1 CFR 21.45. The examples in 1 CFR 21.52 are revised to reflect the OFR's format forauthority citations. One commenter suggested that paragraphs (a) and (b) of andSection; 21.52be clarified. The ACFR agrees. The text of 1 CFR 21.52 is restructuredand language is added to clarify that citations to titles of the UnitedStates Code, may be cited without Public Law or U.S. Statutes at Largecitation. Citations to Public Laws and U.S. Statutes at Large are optionalwhen the United States Code is cited.The undesignated center headings in Parts 17 and 22 are designated as subpartheadings.An editorial change is made throughout Part 22 from use of the words ``rulemaking proposals'' and ``notices of proposed rule making'' to the words``proposed rules''. This change is consistent with the proposed rules categoryof documents described in new 1 CFR 5.9. To conform with this editorialchange, the part heading, table of contents, and subpart headings in Part22 have been revised.It is no longer necessary to place the CFR citation referred to in 1 CFR22.6 in brackets. Obsolete language requiring the use of brackets is removed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Procedural Matters </ITAG>This is not a major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291.
