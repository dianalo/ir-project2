The charge was anticipated, but its size was twice some analysts' expectations.    And the telecommunications giant suggested that its problems -- principally sluggish sales of phone and computer equipment -- aren't yet behind it. Despite $1 billion in cost savings next year from the moves, ATandamp;T officials indicated earnings won't improve substantially until 1988.    Nevertheless, the magnitude of the moves indicate that ATandamp;T's new chairman, James E. Olson, is serious about restructuring the company.    ATandamp;T said the charge will reduce 1986 net income by $1.7 billion, or $1.63 a share, giving ATandamp;T only a small profit for the year, and a big fourth-quarter loss. In this year's first nine months, the company earned $1.48 billion, or $1.32 a share.    In the year-ago fourth quarter, ATandamp;T earned $364.1 million, or 32 cents a share.    Robert M. Kavner, chief financial officer, also said that ATandamp;T's costs should be reduced by between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion by 1989 as a result of moves associated with the $3.2 billion charge.    The charge is the second largest ever taken by an American company. ATandamp;T itself took the largest only three years ago when it wrote off $10 billion before taxes of obsolete equipment in the divestiture of its 22 local phone companies.    At a quickly convened news conference, ATandamp;T executives portrayed the moves as a way to strengthen the company financially for future growth. Mr. Olson said later, at a meeting of 300 securities analysts, &quot;Earnings improvement is my top priority.&quot;    ATandamp;T has yet to earn the $2.02 a share it predicted for 1984; last year, earnings totaled $1.55 billion, or $1.37 a share, on $34.9 billion in revenue.    &quot;Positive effects probably won't show up in the company's earnings before 1988,&quot; Mr. Olson told the analysts. Mr. Kavner explained &quot;you can't take the beneficial effect (of the cost-savings) and directly apply it to earnings&quot; next year because of other factors, such as an expected decline in rental revenue as customers buy, rather than lease, equipment from ATandamp;T and its competitors.    Analysts viewed the announcements negatively -- particularly the outlook for earnings. &quot;Absent this write-off, 1987 would have been a flaming disaster,&quot; said John Bain, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., who had projected that ATandamp;T would earn $2.05 a share next year. &quot;I've heard some analysts mention $1.50 a share&quot; as their estimate of next year's earnings, he said.    At least partly reflecting that view, ATandamp;T's was the most actively traded stock yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $26 a share, down $1.25, on volume of 4,861,400 shares.    Analysts also were dismayed that executives had given few details about one of the company's main targets for growth: data networking, which ATandamp;T has defined as selling big businesses equipment and services to link together their computers and phones. &quot;That is the sort of story analysts have heard for 10 years from a bunch of companies, and they all have gone out and lost a fortune at it,&quot; said Mr. Bain.    &quot;I don't think the top management of ATandamp;T has convinced anyone that data networking is anything more than a vague concept now,&quot; said Jack Grubman at PaineWebber Inc. &quot;Their traditional businesses are doing extremely well, but they are topped out. And their hopes for the long term are based on two pipe dreams,&quot; he said, referring to data networking and long-distance deregulation. &quot;The stock isn't one that is going to be worth owning anytime soon.&quot;    Indeed, company sources say ATandamp;T's Data Systems Division may post $1.2 billion in pre-tax operating losses this year, probably won't show revenue growth next year, and still will post a loss of several hundred million dollars next year. Asked at the news conference for some way to gauge ATandamp;T's progress in this unit, Mr. Olson said only that the company's data-networking strategy &quot;will unfold over a period of time. We aren't going to pre-announce products and services.&quot; ATandamp;T recently hired Vittorio Cassoni of Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; C. S.p.A. to head that unit; Mr. Cassoni is emphasizing cost cutting and exports of ATandamp;T products to Europe, managers in the unit have said.    ATandamp;T has been handing out severance packages to employees for the past several weeks, mostly in two units that are being merged: Communications and Information Systems. Robert E. Allen, ATandamp;T president and chief operating officer, said the company had notified 30% to 40% of the 27,400 employees who will lose their jobs. He said most of the cuts will be concluded by the end of next year.    Because so many employees have yet to be notified, said Robert Morris, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., &quot;that can't help productivity much.&quot;    Mr. Olson said he has met with about 40,000 of ATandamp;T's 321,000 employees in the past two months, and while they seem enthusiastic about his strategies, &quot;the anxiety level is still there&quot; and probably will remain until the bulk of the cuts have been taken.    ATandamp;T wouldn't specify which units would be most affected by the job cuts, which are in addition to 5,000 previously announced dismissals. Those cuts were accounted for in a charge against third-quarter earnings. About $1 billion of the planned fourth-quarter charge, or about $545 million after taxes, stems mostly from costs associated with laying off employees, ATandamp;T said.    Jobs to be cut include 10,900 management jobs, or about 9% of ATandamp;T's total managers, and 16,500 non-management jobs, or about 8%, some of them in ATandamp;T's factories.    In interviews several weeks ago, the company's executives indicated that job cuts were anticipated -- mostly through elimination of duplicative staff jobs following the merging of Communications and Information Systems -- and that few jobs were expected to be cut in the Network Systems group, which makes telephone switching gear, and the Network Operations group, which runs the long-distance network. But executives said yesterday that job cuts will occur throughout the company's operations.    Through these latest job cuts, ATandamp;T will have reduced its total employment to about 290,000 from 374,000 on Jan. 1, 1984, when it shed the local companies. Mr. Allen said job reductions at the Bell Laboratories unit, which probably has been least affected by ATandamp;T's business troubles, will take place only through attrition next year. He added that the company doesn't expect another major layoff; yesterday's announcement was its third major layoff since divestiture.    Costs for consolidating facilities, including factories, warehouses and offices, account for about $1.2 billion of the pre-tax charge and $620 million after taxes, ATandamp;T said. Again, the company wouldn't identify the facilities most affected, but executives have indicated that excess capacity exists primarily in its semiconductor and parts factories and in factories that make equipment with older technologies.    Mr. Allen recently appointed William Warwick, a top manufacturing vice president, to assess ATandamp;T's factories, material and inventory management systems. Mr. Warwick is credited with turning around ATandamp;T's Consumer Products business, in part by shifting manufacturing overseas and vastly improving the time it takes to assemble finished goods.    Mr. Kavner said the part of the announced package most subject to change is the $1 billion pre-tax charge, or $580 million after taxes, accounting for the reduction in the value of inventory and changes in depreciation methods. He said $600 million of the charge accounts for reducing carrying values of inventory such as computers and communications equipment.    Sources have said Data Systems was writing down about $300 million of equipment including the Unix PC, which hasn't sold well. Recent sales results for other computers also have been dismal. Mr. Kavner said ATandamp;T has enough Unix PCs in inventory that it won't contract for the manufacture of any more in 1987.    While analysts called the moves bold, they said they were dismayed that it is taking ATandamp;T so long to turn itself around. It has been three years since the company shed its local phone companies, and 1987 &quot;will be the fourth lousy year in a row,&quot; said James McCabe of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. &quot;Olson has a difficult job ahead of him. All you can do is look at their record and be skeptical.&quot; He said he reduced his rating of the stock to &quot;OK to sell.&quot;    ATandamp;T executives also have expressed disappointment with the company's earning ability. However, they pointed out that at divestiture they were under public pressure to ensure the financial health of the local operating companies rather than plan for the future of ATandamp;T. Because of their monopoly of local phone service and success at getting rate increases, the local companies have turned out to be surprisingly strong performers.    Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it placed the debt ratings of ATandamp;T and its subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade. Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said its ratings of the company's debt would be unaffected.    Yesterday, following the announcements, Mr. Olson took pains to note that the company plans $3.9 billion in capital investments next year, will continue to expand internationally, and doesn't intend to pull out of any major markets, including the computer business.    &quot;ATandamp;T isn't retreating to its old business,&quot; he said. &quot;It isn't retrenching. We are strengthening our core business to move forward to other, faster-growing markets.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
