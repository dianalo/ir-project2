But I can't think that way.&quot;;   Wide-receivers coach Sherman Lewis lists Sherrard as the 49ers' No. 3 playerat the position, behind standouts Jerry Rice and John Taylor.;    &quot;I don'tthink Mike's quite as fast as last year at this time,&quot; Lewis said. &quot;I'mconstantly monitoring him during practice. I'm always asking him how he feels.He knows when it's time to slow down and take it easy.&quot;;    Sherrard, whopractices only in the mornings, is not allowed to practice during theafternoons. He said his leg becomes too weak and sore after an extended amountof running.;    Sherrard, a former UCLA All-American, fractured his rightfibula -- the long bone in the lower leg -- for the third time last season.;   &quot;We don't look at last year's injury like the first two,&quot; Lewis said. &quot;Lastyear, he was trying to get extra yardage and his legs just got caught. It wasmore of a freak injury.&quot;;    Sherrard broke the leg while making a key firstdown against Cleveland at Candlestick Park on Oct. 28. He rehabilitated theinjury and came back for the 49ers' two playoff games in January.;    Afterthe 49ers' NFC championship loss to the New York Giants, doctors operated toremove a metal pin that had been inserted in Sherrard's leg after the Octoberbreak.;    &quot;Overall, I wish I could practice twice a day,&quot; Sherrard said. &quot;Myrunning feels close to 100 percent.&quot;;    Sherrard signed with the 49ers as aPlan B free agent after the 1988 season when the Dallas Cowboys left himunprotected. He spent the '89 season on injured reserve before being activatedfor the team's playoff run. He caught passes in all three postseason games,including the 49ers' Super Bowl XXIV victory over Denver.;    Last season,Sherrard went through his first full training camp since his rookie seasonwith Dallas.;    &quot;I felt great at last year's camp,&quot; Sherrard said. &quot;I'm notquite back to where I was at last year's camp, but I'm getting there.&quot;;   Before breaking his leg last season, Sherrard caught 17 passes for 264 yardsand what turned out to be a team-high 15.5-yard average.;    &quot;There's no doubthe's a big-play guy,&quot; Lewis said. &quot;I certainly don't think he's injuryprone.&quot;;    Said Sherrard: &quot;I'm not where I need to be. . . . I still have away to go.&quot;;  SHERRARD ON THE ROAD BACK; (box) What wide receiver MikeSherrard must do this training camp:;    (box)  1. Sherrard must be able toremain injury-free.

He must be able to rebuild the strengthin his right leg. He broke the fibula last October and had an operation afterlast season's playoffs.
