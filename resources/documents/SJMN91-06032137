They have emphasized that allied forces carefullytargeted only military and war-related industrial sites.;    Gen. Schwarzkopfacknowledged Wednesday that refugee reports of civilian deaths may be correctin some cases. Jordanian officials, for instance, assert that U.S. bombers,which are targeting mobile Scud launchers and a purported military supplyline, have killed refugees fleeing along one of the only escape routes fromIraq.;    &quot;We have never said there won't be any civilian casualties,&quot; saidSchwarzkopf. &quot;(U)nfortunately, that's what happens when you have a war.&quot;; WHATOTHERS SAY:;    Low casualty figures are not unlikely, said analysts at theCenter for Defense Information and the Center for Strategic and InternationalStudies.;    &quot;I find it plausible that the casualties are not above 1,000,&quot;said Marcus Corbin, defense analyst at the Center for Defense Information.;   &quot;The numbers (from Iraq) are probably in the ballpark,&quot; said Ervin Massinga,analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.;    Bothanalysts pointed out that the new technology of smart bombing has probablyreduced civilian casualties.;    But reporter Maleh Ibrahim, who works for thegovernment-controlled Iraqi News Agency, says radio reports from the MiddleEast suggest allied bombing has been far more devastating than even the Iraqigovernment is currently reporting.;    &quot;It is not smart bombing, really,&quot;Ibrahim said. &quot;I remember the areas that (reports say) were hit. So manymarkets, museums, mosques, parks, so many civilian targets. I think thecivilian casualties are really very high.&quot;;    The confusion, promoted by bothsides, isn't likely to clear anytime soon, according to Todd Gitlin, professorof sociology and mass communications at the University of Berkeley,California.;    Washington officials, still haunted by the images of civilianmassacres inflicted by the U.S. in Vietnam, prefer to avoid the issueentirely, Gitlin said. And Saddam is trying to appear as though his country islargely withstanding the air onslaught, though some innocent civilians aredying.;    Accurate figures for civilian casualties in all wars have beendifficult to come by, said Gitlin. For example, the Panama invasion -- asimple military action compared to the war in the Persian Gulf -- resulted in300 civilians killed, according to the official Pentagon account, but as muchas 2,000 by other accounts.;    Gitlin said his own research on the Vietnamwar produced estimates of civilian deaths that varied by as much as a factorof four.;    &quot;While the fighting is going on, the figures are all estimates,&quot;said Gitlin. And afterwards, nobody ever cares anymore.&quot;  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910201  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  578  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday February 1, 199100032137,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
