In his third State of the Union address last night, Mr.Bush cast the war in moral terms, saying it represented aneffort to &quot;confront evil for the sake of good in a land sofar away.&quot; He said flatly &quot;we will prevail&quot; in forcing Iraqout of neighboring Kuwait, and insisted he hasn't expandedhis goals to include the destruction of Iraq.</LP><TEXT>   In addition to restating his goals for the war, Mr. Bushunveiled one concrete policy change stemming directly fromthe conflict. In an attempt to capitalize on the spectacularsuccess U.S. missile defenses have had in the war, heannounced that he is altering the Strategic DefenseInitiative to focus on the kind of &quot;limited ballistic missilestrikes&quot; Iraq has been launching on Saudi Arabia and Israel.   Mr. Bush also defended his continued close ties withSoviet leaders despite their crackdown in the Baltics,asserting that the U.S. has received indications that theKremlin plans to pull some troops out of the area and toresume talks with Baltic leaders. Other officials said thosesignals came from the Soviet foreign minister in talks herethis week.   The president's speech, to a joint session of Congress,amounted to the first wartime State of the Union address in ageneration. But he also used it to emphasize anoften-repeated appeal that the nation's other business go on.To that end he devoted more than half the speech to adiscussion of domestic concerns and said he will propose ahandful of new programs, including an overhaul of the bankingsystem and a National Energy Strategy to promote energyefficiency, development, and conservation.   The president acknowledged the recession, but made clearthat he isn't suggesting any specific response to it. &quot;Wewill get this recession behind us, and return to growth --soon,&quot; he said. Aides said the recession probably will beover before the federal government could attack it. However,the president did revive proposals to foster long-termgrowth, such as lower capital-gains tax rates and taxincentives for personal savings and research and development.   In this part of his speech, however, Mr. Bush mostlycalled for some of the programs he introduced in his firsttwo years in office. Making what he called &quot;an appeal forrenewal,&quot; Mr. Bush asked Congress to pass, and the Americanpeople to support, previous proposals to improve education,fight crime, and eliminate political action committees.   Mr. Bush also dusted off a concept from his eight years asvice president in the Reagan administration. He suggestedscrapping scores of federal programs and turning over $15billion a year from these programs to the states &quot;forflexible management.&quot; He said he will send Congress a list of$20 billion in specific federal grants to states from whichthe administration and Congress would jointly select thegrant programs to be killed. Mr. Bush asserted that federalprograms are too often treated as if they are &quot;immortal&quot; andadded: &quot;It's time for a more dynamic program life cycle.&quot;Unlike President Reagan, Mr. Bush promised that theconsolidated programs would be &quot;fully funded.&quot;   In his comments about the domestic agenda, Mr. Bush seemedto answer critics who have questioned whether hisadministration has shown the same determination inconfronting domestic problems as it has in dealing with theGulf.   Saying that if the nation can &quot;selflessly&quot; confront Iraqfor the &quot;sake of good. . . . then surely we can make thisland all that it should be. If anyone tells you America'sbest days are behind her, they're looking the wrong way,&quot; Mr.Bush said. In addressing the problems of the poor, Mr. Bushadopted the language favored by a group of activistconservatives within his administration who have been callingfor a new emphasis on choice. Mr. Bush said his programswould work by &quot;strengthening the power and choice ofindividuals, and families.&quot;   While eschewing the need for more &quot;bureaucracy,&quot; Mr. Bushsaid the fiscal 1992 budget he will announce next week willcall for new incentives to create jobs in inner cities,so-called enterprise zones, a program to encourage tenantownership and control of public housing, and a plan to giveparents more leeway in choosing their children's publicschools.   &quot;Freedom and the power to choose should not be theprivilege of wealth,&quot; Mr. Bush said. &quot;They are the birthrightof every American.&quot;   &quot;Good health care is every American's right, and everyAmerican's responsibility&quot; Mr. Bush asserted, though heoffered no plan to provide health care to those withoutinsurance. Instead, he promised new programs for preventivehealth care, which aides said include money to reduce infantmortality in big cities and a new program to detect breastand cervical cancer.   Mr. Bush also promised to send Congress his own version ofa new Civil Rights Act, a variation of which he vetoed lastyear, saying it would impose hiring quotas in the workplace.And he again sounded the call for volunteerism with which heopened his administration two years ago. &quot;We have within ourreach the promise of a renewed America,&quot; he said. &quot;We canfind meaning and reward by serving some purpose higher thanourselves -- a shining purpose, the illumination of athousand points of light.&quot;   Mr. Bush's passing reference to banking reform did littleto build momentum for a program that will be difficult topush through Congress. The proposal, which the administrationintends to announce next week, will call for changing thedeposit insurance system, augmenting bank capital, allowingbanks to combine with other businesses within new financialservices holding companies and simplifying bank regulation.   The president also addressed the credit crunch by callingfor lower interest rates and urging banks to make more loans.   Delivering the Democratic response, Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell of Maine sought to put aside past differencesover U.S. policy in the Gulf, but his remarks were implicitlycritical of the administration for not doing more to addresswrongs elsewhere in the world as well as at home.   &quot;Students massacred in China, priests murdered in CentralAmerica, demonstrators gunned down in Lithuania -- these actsof violence are as wrong as Iraqi soldiers killingcivilians,&quot; said the Maine Democrat. &quot;We cannot opposerepression in one place and overlook it in another.&quot;   As if mindful of the politics of the war, Democrats gavesome of the best seats in the chamber to defense industryexecutives or businessmen who actively supported thepresident's decision to use force against Iraq.   Speaker Thomas Foley's guest list, for example, includedsenior executives from Raytheon Co. and General DynamicsCorp., which manufacture the Patriot and Tomahawk cruisemissiles respectively, as well as Time Warner co-chairmanSteve Ross, who had actively supported congressional actionthis month authorizing the U.S. attack on Iraq.   Closer to home, Mr. Mitchell emphasized the need for amore aggressive federal role in energy and health policy.&quot;The president says he seeks a new world order. We ask him tojoin us in putting our own house in order. We have a crisisabroad. But we also have a crisis here at home.&quot;   Mr. Mitchell also specifically attacked the president'sproposal to cut the capital-gains tax rate, saying it wouldchiefly benefit those with incomes over $200,000 a year, andhe pointedly noted that &quot;not many kids whose families earnmore than $200,000 a year volunteer to join the Army.&quot;   Mr. Bush devoted much of his speech to a general, almostphilosophical, explanation to Americans of why he thinks U.S.armed forces should be leading the fight to evict Iraqitroops from Kuwait. He returned again and again to the themethat success in the battle will ensure a more tranquil worldfor decades to come.   &quot;We will succeed in the Gulf,&quot; he said. &quot;And when we do,the world community will have sent an enduring warning to anydictator or despot, present or future, who contemplatesoutlaw aggression.&quot;   Mr. Bush argued that the U.S. has a special responsibilityto accomplish such lofty goals because of America's powerfulposition in the world. &quot;This is the burden of leadership, andthe strength that has made America the beacon of freedom in asearching world.&quot;   The chamber was unusually crowded in anticipation of thepresident's speech, but it was not until he spoke directly ofthe troops in the Gulf that he touched a chord with themembers. His warning to Iraq against mistreating alliedprisoners-of-war again brought the room to its feet led bySenate Republican Leader Robert Dole, who was severelywounded in World War II.   Administration officials who helped prepare the speechsaid Mr. Bush was attempting to give a confident appraisal ofthe war effort, without engaging in any bravado. Thepresident left little doubt that he is sure the U.S. willdefeat Iraq militarily but was careful to avoid promisingwhen victory would come.   But he appeared to suggest that Americans won't have towait long. The war is &quot;on course,&quot; he declared, adding:&quot;Iraq's capacity to sustain war is being destroyed. Ourinvestment, our training, our planning -- all are paying off.Time will not be Saddam's salvation.&quot;   Mr. Bush also appeared eager to douse congressionalworries that his bitter assertions that Saddam Hussein iscommitting war crimes and will be brought to justice reflecta decision to expand America's war goals to include a driveto get the Iraqi leader himself. &quot;Our purpose in the PersianGulf remains constant: To drive Iraq out of Kuwait, torestore Kuwait's legitimate government, and to ensure thestability and security of this critical region,&quot; he said.   &quot;We do not seek the destruction of Iraq, its culture orits people,&quot; Mr. Bush declared.   In his remarks, President Bush gave only a passing nod toanti-war demonstrators in the U.S. &quot;Democracy brings theundeniable value of thoughtful dissent -- and we have heardsome dissenting voices here at home, some, a handful,reckless, but most responsible,&quot; he said. &quot;But the fact thatall voices have the right to speak out is one of the reasonswe've been united in purpose and principle for 200 years.&quot;   In one somber note, Mr. Bush also referred to the turmoilin the Soviet Union and the recent violent crackdown onindependence movements there. Mr. Bush defended his decisionto maintain close contact with the Soviet leadership despitesome domestic pressure to react more harshly to the Sovietcrackdown, saying: &quot;Our relationship with the Soviet Union isimportant, not only to us, but to the world.&quot;   He said dialogue between the two countries is important toencouraging increasing democracy in the U.S.S.R. And Mr. Bushalso said that in his recent talks with Soviet leadership --he met with new Soviet Foreign Minister AlexanderBessmertnykh on Monday -- he has been given &quot;representations&quot;that, if acted upon, could lead to the withdrawal of someSoviet forces from the Baltics and &quot;a reopening of dialogue&quot;between the Soviet government and the Baltic states.   ---   David Rogers and David Wessel contributed to this article.
