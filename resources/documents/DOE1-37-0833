The radiation-related excess was statistically significantin persons with cumulative lifetime exposures of 1.0-4.999 rem. Whenasbestos and welding histories were combined into a single risk factor,odds ratios for the combined exposure were significantly elevated fortwo of three duration-of-exposure categories examined. Further analysisof data on radiation exposure, controlling for exposures to asbestosand welding, found reductions in initial estimates of radiation riskat all levels of radiation exposure. This reduction suggests that radiationworkers were more heavily exposed to asbestos and/or welding fumes thanwere other workers and that those exposures confounded the observed associationbetween radiation and lung cancer. Analysis of mortality by time sincefirst exposure to radiation revealed no pattern of progressive increaseas latency increased. By contrast, odds ratios for asbestos/welding increasedwith latency. Data on cigarette smoking and socioeconomic status werenot available. The results of this study do not preclude a possible associationbetween radiation exposure at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and excessmortality from lung cancer. However, they provide no evidence in supportof such a relation.</TEXT></DOC>
