The differences and similaritiesbetween deposition patterns in the human dichotomous branching tracheobronchialtree and the canine monopodial branching were documented. Hollow airwaycasts were prepared from whole lungs obtained at autopsy from a 45-year-oldman and from a mixed-breed dog. Morphometric measurements were made onthe casts through the fifth generation for all airway branches and tothe terminal airways along a major branch path, a minor branch path,and a path that alternately selects major and minor branches. Flow measurementswere made for inspiratory flow and pulsatile inspiratory flow. Pulsatileinspiratory flow was found to be more realistic than steady flow in thismodel. The hollow airway cast system was evaluated for use in investigationsof patterns of gas transfer to airway surfaces.</TEXT></DOC>
