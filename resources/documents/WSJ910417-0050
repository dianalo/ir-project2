Defaults wereexpected to be both rare and relatively painless; thecompanies' underlying business would roll on unscathed. Butthe optimists -- the deal makers and many academics -- werewrong.   The penalties for default are turning out to be severe.Angry creditors are balking at nearly everydebt-reorganization plan and, in many cases, stretching outrestructurings for years. Reorganizing a company's debts isan ordeal for all involved and often ends in bankruptcyanyway.   Insolvent companies' businesses are being decimated. Theirsales, payrolls and investment plans are shrinking. Sinceentering bankruptcy court, Federated Department Stores Inc.,one of America's largest retailers, has cut capital spendingmore than 50%, and Ames Department Stores Inc. has laid offmore than 18,000 workers and closed 220 stores.   Such economic wreckage seemed unimaginable a few years ago-- at least to people who profited from the boom inborrowing. In an essay written in the mid-1980s, FrederickJoseph, the chief executive of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,did consider that overleveraged companies might run intotrouble. But he wasn't worried. Such companies could &quot;selloff assets, restructure their balance sheets or take othersteps to stay ahead of their debt service,&quot; he wrote.&quot;There's no reason to assume that the economic horizon willbe littered with bankruptcies.&quot;   But in fact, it is being littered with bankruptcies. Lastyear, 96 U.S. companies defaulted on a record $22 billion ofbonds, according to Moody's Investors Service. In this year'srecession-hit first quarter, bond defaults rose to a record$8.2 billion from $5.7 billion a year earlier and only $1.3billion two years earlier.   In the mid-1980s, by contrast, leveraged companies wereapparently thriving, and the few laggards were quicklyrestructured. Bondholders often patched up troubled companiesin as little as 10 days, says Gregory Milmoe of Skadden ArpsSlate Meagher andamp; Flom, a New York law firm that was big in thetakeover game and now is big in the bankruptcy game.   And if a restructuring didn't go smoothly, junk-bondunderwriter Drexel was there to give it a push. In 1987,Western Union Corp. ran into trouble completing a debtexchange because of a holdout creditor, Leucadia NationalCorp. But Michael Milken flew through a snowstorm to Utah,where Leucadia President Joseph Steinberg was skiing, andpersuaded him to go along.   &quot;At least when Milken was in control, he would kind ofdictate the terms,&quot; says an investor who holds a lot ofdefaulted bonds. &quot;Now you no longer have a center&quot; -- thatis, someone running the show.   But some quick fixes, including Western Union's, arrangedby Mr. Milken and others merely paved the way for laterproblems. Mr. Milmoe notes &quot;a loss of trust&quot; amongbondholders, who now have been burned too often to be easilyswayed. Last year, Salomon Brothers Inc. tracked 54 ailingcompanies that tried to lighten their debt with cut-pricetender or exchange offers and found that only 26 hadsucceeded.   &quot;We are in a mess,&quot; Harvard's Prof. Jensen now says. Hestands by his theories about painless restructurings but says&quot;disastrous decisions&quot; by Congress and bankruptcy courts haveincreased the filings under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy act.He especially objects to a 1990 court ruling that reduced theclaims of LTV Corp. bondholders who had swapped their bondsin an earlier restructuring. He says the ruling has madebondholders less likely to accept out-of-courtrestructurings.   Prof. Jensen also argues that Congress, in revising theTax Code in October, penalized companies that want to do debtexchanges. Congress said companies out of bankruptcy mayincur a taxable gain when issuing low-yielding debt inexchange for high-coupon bonds. Now, he says, companies thatare restructuring shun the once-beneficial swaps and insteadgo into bankruptcy proceedings to sidestep a taxable gain.   Mr. Jensen notes, perhaps, some important changes, buteven without them would the broad landscape of overleveragedcorporations have looked much different? As may be seen froma look at several companies, insolvency can bring a host ofoperating problems, from sinking sales to a loss of tradecredit, and these tend to worsen if the restructuring processdrags on.   Eastern Airlines, for instance, failed to anticipate howtough it is to operate in bankruptcy. At a meeting withcreditors shortly after its March 1989 bankruptcy filing,Eastern's officials said it had enough assets to repay itscreditors in full. One lender suggested that Eastern do so byselling its planes, landing rights and other assets andliquidating immediately.   Eastern ignored the creditors, but as it kept operating,its business disintegrated. To raise money, it had to sellits profitable Washington-New York-Boston shuttle and itsLatin American routes. Those routes, though promising,required capital and a strong Miami hub.   And Eastern had been weakened in Miami -- partly becauseAMR Corp.'s American Airlines and Pan Am Corp. had seenopportunity in Eastern's distress and expanded there.Meanwhile, credit-card companies, wary of lending money forEastern tickets, insisted that Eastern increase its escrowaccounts.   Worst of all, travelers backed off. &quot;The airline businessrelies so much on consumer confidence,&quot; says Martin ShugrueJr., Eastern's trustee in bankruptcy. Whenever creditors wentto bankruptcy court to demand that Eastern shut down, or atleast be prevented from spending more money, ticket salesslumped. &quot;You could tell which days the stories ran in thenewspaper from looking at our sales charts,&quot; Mr. Shugruesays. Meanwhile, bankruptcy expenses were costing Eastern $3million a month.   Early this year, two years after reassuring its creditors,Eastern shut down, and it now is being forced to liquidate.Creditor hopes of being paid in full have turned to ash, andsome defaulted Eastern bonds trade at just 50 cents on thedollar.   &quot;Chapter 11 creates a false sense of security,&quot; says PhilBakes, Eastern's former president. &quot;Bankruptcy is veryperilous.&quot;   One peril lies in managements' ability to prolong theprocess for years. In the academic view, as expressed byHarvard's John Pound in 1988, managers of insolvent companiesface &quot;an automatic -- not potential -- loss of control.&quot; Butoutside of Harvard, it is far less automatic.   At Integrated Resources Inc., management and creditorshave been waging a two-year battle for control. Integrated, amajor seller of real-estate limited partnerships and otherinvestments, declared a moratorium on its nearly $2 billionin debt in June 1989 and filed for protection from creditorsin February 1990.   By law, managements, not creditors, have the exclusiveright to propose settlements during the first 120 days ofbankruptcy proceedings. Moreover, the courts can extend that&quot;control period,&quot; a possibility that gives managementstremendous bargaining power. Recently, Integrated persuadedthe court to extend its exclusive right for the fourth time.So, nearly two years after the default, Integrated'screditors still can't propose plans. They wail that they arebeing held hostage.   Integrated has liquidated most of its assets, but it wantsto hang onto its &quot;contract rights,&quot; a revenue stream of $1.7billion over the next 30 or so years from partnerships thatit had organized. Under its proposal, its highest-rankingcreditors, whose claims total $1.4 billion, would get anongoing interest in the contract rights as well as about $350million in cash.   But the senior creditors, rather than invest inIntegrated's future, want the rights sold off and theproceeds turned over to them. &quot;The debtor's plan isprincipally formulated to perpetuate management's ownself-interest,&quot; James P. Heffernan, an investor in securitiesof defaulted companies who holds Integrated commercial paper,argues in an affidavit. He notes that Integrated recentlyproposed a &quot;management bonus plan&quot; to reward its executiveswith as much as $25 million in cash, plus new stock in areorganized Integrated. &quot;All of us on the committee considerthe bonuses being demanded to be utterly inappropriate,&quot; Mr.Heffernan adds.   Creditors say in bankruptcy-court filings that they arebeing &quot;severely harmed by the delay.&quot; Three of Integrated'stop executives pocket a salary of at least $500,000, andbankruptcy costs are draining the company's value by $2million a month.   Integrated's chairman, Stephen Weinroth, blames the delayon the creditors, who, he says, haven't responded to any ofhis plans. &quot;We've never gotten a piece of paper from them,&quot;he says. &quot;We've sold 25 assets in less than 24 months. If youfault that -- that's nuts.&quot;   Mr. Weinroth, who was Integrated's investment banker atDrexel while Integrated loaded up on debt, defends hiscompensation: &quot;We're really underpaid. We're running 18businesses here.&quot; He also contends that creditors would getmore value by accepting Integrated's plan. &quot;You can'tliquidate everything quickly, or you get terrible prices,&quot; hesays.   Though the battle at Integrated has turned nasty, some ofthe fiercest wars are waged among various classes ofcreditors themselves. Such a war is roiling Interco Inc., amaker of furniture and footwear that defaulted on $1.03billion of junk bonds last June 15. It proposed handing overan 82% ownership stake to bondholders, in return for wipingout much of its junk-bond debt and slashing interest rates onwhat remained. Instead of bringing peace, however, that planriled holders of Interco's three different issues of junkbonds.   &quot;We weren't being offered anywhere near enough equity,&quot;says Mark Dickstein, a New Yorker who owned a lot ofInterco's 14 1/2% subordinated bonds. He complained that toobig a stake would go to holders of the 13 3/4% seniorsubordinated debentures.   By August, Interco and its advisers had rejiggered theexchange offer and won tentative approval from all threebondholder groups. But by then, the company's furniture saleswere slipping, and operating earnings from the Conversesneaker and Florsheim shoe units trailed forecasts.   The bondholders got jumpy. Even after the proposedrestructuring, they worried, the company couldn't service itsdebts and would need to restructure again -- and the newstock would become worthless. In a two-hour conference callin November, Interco's 50 largest bondholders hooted down thedebt plan they had endorsed just three months earlier.   Then bondholders turned their ire toward another group ofcreditors, the commercial banks that had lent Interco $573million. The banks were being asked to take only minorlosses.   Such inter-creditor warfare has mushroomed partly becauseof junk bonds. &quot;There used to be simple capital structures,&quot;says Jay Goldsmith, another bankruptcy investor. &quot;Now youhave crazy securities up and down the line.&quot;   Senior creditors, such as banks, have first claim on adebtor's assets and tend to push for liquidations that wouldpay them off but leave little for other creditors.Bondholders, lower down on the pecking order, often fight topreserve the company as a going concern in which all thecreditors get stock.   In theory, Interco's 50-odd banks, led by J.P. Morgan andamp;Co. and Bank of New York, were in a rock-solid position: Theyhad first claim on Interco's assets. But bondholders demandedthat the banks cut their claims by as much as $200 million.The bondholders' main weapon was to threaten to push Intercointo bankruptcy, gambling that such talk would frighten thebanks into concessions. Interco's junk bonds had sunk to fourcents on the dollar or less, and bondholders figured they hadlittle to lose. &quot;We told the banks: `If this thing melts downand loses $300 million, it's all your money,'&quot; one bondholderrecalls.   Before long, the bondholders' bluff was called. NCNBCorp., which processed payroll checks of Interco'sfurniture-making employees in Lenoir, N.C., and was one ofInterco's smaller bank lenders, had heard the threats. OnJan. 23, the Lenoir NCNB branch said it wouldn't acceptInterco paychecks anymore. Local employees were panicked.Interco, fearing that suppliers might cut off shipments,filed for Chapter 11 protection the next evening.   Now Interco is starting restructuring talks anew, with theadded legal costs of bankruptcy proceedings. Analysts say itmay not emerge from Chapter 11 for a year or more. When andif it does, it probably won't be the same.   Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson, the Los Angeles Laker star who haslong endorsed Interco's Converse sneakers, doesn't considerrestructuring painless. He recently told the National, thesports newspaper: &quot;With all the things that's happened withConverse, I really don't want to be with them. They don'thave the money to put in advertising. Even if they come outof bankruptcy, I still don't want them.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
