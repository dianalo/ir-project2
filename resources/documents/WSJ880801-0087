Angrist (WSJ Special) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LATAM MDEST </CO><IN> CMD PCS PET MON </IN><G> ERG </G><TEXT>   Silver prices often move in sympathy with those of agricultural commodities, but while the Midwest rains in recent weeks sent most soybean and grain futures prices plunging, silver futures initially extended their rally.    Analysts explained the apparent anomaly by noting that the climb in silver prices hadn't approached that of the crop commodities such as soybeans.    But about as quickly as the explanations were formulated, silver turned tail and fell in line with its agricultural commodity cousins with a vengeance. Early July prices of more than $8.20 an ounce fell to late July lows of nearly $1.35 an ounce less. Friday, the heavily traded September contract on the Commodity Exchange in New York finished at $6.855 an ounce, more or less where it was in May, before the summer silver rally began.    While the silver run-up essentially reflected an inflation play, silver hasn't done well as a hedge. In the 10 years through June, for example, its price was up only 30% compared with a 90% jump in the consumer price index. Nor have many silver bears yet had a change of heart.    &quot;We think there will be a major buying opportunity in all the precious metals, but now it is vastly premature,&quot; says Martin Weiss, co-editor of Holt Advisory, a biweekly newsletter on stocks and commodities.    But others see reason for optimism. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s recently published annual review of the world silver industry concludes that while the metal's surplus will continue this year, renewed public buying interest in silver should bolster prices. Coin demand should remain strong, particularly with the Olympic Games commemorative coins boosting Far Eastern interest in silver, Shearson believes.    Such price support is limited because implied investment demand, including coinage, accounts only for a fraction of total consumption, amounting to about 14% last year. Still, silver investment is seen climbing sharply; Shearson expects total silver consumption to increase slightly more than 3% this year compared with 1987, but the firm forecasts that investment demand will rise 40%, to 2,668 metric tons.    Jeffrey Christian, managing director at CPM Group, a New York-based commodity research firm, describes himself as a &quot;timid bull,&quot; believing prices could reach $8 an ounce by year's end. Dennis Suskind, a partner at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., is also mildly bullish, seeing year-end prices above $7.50 an ounce.    In the past 10 days Peru, the world's second-largest silver producer, announced that it planned purchases above the world market price. Don Tierney, a precious metals analyst at Stanley B. Bell andamp; Co., commodity brokers, sees Peru's action as at best neutral to the market. &quot;The government program just won't be able to remove that much silver from the market,&quot; he says.    Mr. Christian also believes that Peru's move won't influence the market much. &quot;Silver's price has got ahead of where we thought it should be now primarily due to some speculative activity. Currently, the fundamentals can support a price in the range from $6.80 to $7.50. I am more bullish on silver now, however, than a few weeks ago because investment demand is coming along faster than expected.&quot;    Peru also announced that it was going to collateralize a $600 million loan with some of its silver to purchase grain. John Norris, vice president of precious metals at Citibank, says that this move failed to impress the market. He notes, &quot;The market doesn't believe that Peru can afford to take that amount of silver off the market right now. Sooner of later this metal is going to be coming to market.&quot;    Whatever the import of the Peruvian maneuvers, the bulls are hoping silver bottomed out Thursday after a 26-cent plunge that left the September contract at $6.76 an ounce. Friday, the price rebounded 9.5 cents an ounce.    Looking ahead in other futures markets this week:   Energy   Market attention this week will focus on Lausanne, Switzerland, where five leading oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meet Wednesday.    Neither OPEC officials nor oil traders expect much from the meeting of the so-called Committee of Five, also known as the price-monitoring committee. Nevertheless, the very fact that the meeting is being held has added some support to petroleum prices, as oil trading proceeds with caution until the outcome is known.    &quot;When these meetings come about, the initial reaction is that the oil ministers will come up with something positive,&quot; said Shahrokh Nikkhah, a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. vice president, &quot;but that could boomerang.&quot;    A priority item for the meeting will be violators of OPEC's production quotas, chiefly the United Arab Emirates. OPEC Secretary-General Subroto will bring assurances from the Emirates, which he visited last week, of support for actions to stabilize oil markets and strengthen prices. But the price-monitoring committee cannot take official actions for OPEC except to make recommendations or call an emergency conference of all 13 oil ministers.    Grains and Soybeans   This week, traders are looking for evidence that futures prices can extend their Friday recovery from a two-week nosedive. Prices had fallen sharply since mid-July, when the four-month-old drought began to ease.    The conventional wisdom, which hasn't had a good record lately, is that the 20% drop in soybean prices and 17% drop in corn prices since July 18 is enough to attract buyers.    Demand for soybeans has been so poor lately that traders were cheered Friday by reports that the Soviet Union is buying 200,000 metric tons of soybean meal, even though it is from Argentina instead of the U.S. &quot;Any demand is a good sign,&quot; said a grain broker at the Chicago Board of Trade.    Traders will continue to pick through weather forecasts for any sign that the drought could intensify again. According to some private meteorologists, a ridge of high pressure could rebuild over the Midwest this week. The ridge isn't expected to be as intense as it was in May, June and early July, when it blocked storms from moving across the corn and soybean growing states.    The National Weather Service's widely watched 30-day forecast, which was released Friday, said the odds favor above-normal temperatures over most of the Midwest, and below-normal precipitation in Illinois, Indiana and much of Ohio. Normal rainfall is likely over much of Iowa this month, according to the forecast.    If the hot and dry weather materializes, trading interest in soybeans could heat up again. The crop is in its reproductive stage, which is when weather has the biggest bearing on a plant's ability to form pods. The forecast could also fan speculation that spider mites, which thrive in dry weather, could damage the soybean crop.    ---          Silver's Balance Sheet in the Western World    In metric tons                    1983   1984   1985   1986   1987   1988* Mine Production    totals        10,043  9,993  10,361 10,346 10,554 11,268 Secondary Supply  7,505  4,575   5,370  4,580  4,060  4,200 Total Supply     17,548 14,568  15,731 14,926 14,614 15,468 Fabrication    Demand Totals 11,050 11,434  11,606 12,157 12,419 12,800 Coinage             556    271     395    810    970  1,050 Total    Consumption   11,616 11,705  12,001 12,967 13,389 13,850 Surplus           5,932  2,863   3,730  1,959  1,225  1,618 Change in Terminal    Stocks         1,723  (219)   1,071 (1210)    296   -- Implied    Investment     4,209  3,082   2,659  3,169    929  1618 Annual avg. price    ($/oz.)       $11.43  $8.15   $6.14  $5.47  $7.02  $6.50    *Shearson estimate (Decline)   Source: London Metals Research Unit, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
