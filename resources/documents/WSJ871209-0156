The events in Afghanistan over the past eight years provide a sobering counterbalance to the prevailing euphoria surrounding the Reagan-Gorbachev summit.    Mr. McGurn identifies the love of freedom as the principal weapon of the Afghan freedom fighters who &quot;are simply ornery mountain folk who have not cottoned to a foreign power that has seized their land, killed their people and attacked their faith.&quot; American history is also replete with this kind of courage, which now must be mustered and applied toward the prudent, careful consideration -- and rejection, if necessary -- of any accords that could weaken us militarily.    The Afghans are living evidence of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's observation that &quot;Communism stops only when it encounters a wall, even if it is only a wall of resolve.&quot; We must now be equally vigilant to abide by Winston Churchill's advice after World War II: &quot;There is nothing . . . for which the Soviets have less respect than weakness, particularly military weakness, and nothing they admire so much as strength.&quot;    David C. Huff   Lilburn, Ga.   ---   Mr. McGurn's excellent article interested me very much due to my acquaintance with Afghanistan dating back 40 years. Two facts appear self-evident: If the Soviets remain in Afghanistan, the grandchildren of those Soviet soldiers will be fighting the grandchildren of the mujahedeen now opposing them; and by that time three out of every five Soviet soldiers will be Moslem. This should give the Soviet leadership pause for thought.    Richard S. Matson   Sioux City, Iowa</TEXT></DOC>
