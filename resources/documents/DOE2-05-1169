It recognizesthe multiplicity of levels of causality on which migration operates.Therefore, it examines the role of national and international determinantsof migration as well as individual, household, and village level variablesin generating migration. Furthermore, it investigates the role of migrationin bringing about social change in the village economy, social structure,and individual attitudes. Four issues related to emigration are thoroughlyexamined: remittances and their use, the village labor market and laborshortage, the land market in the village, and attitudes toward women.The study demonstrates that emigration to the oil countries is nothingmore than a new link in the long historical tradition of migration fromrural Egypt. The current trend of migration to the oil-producing countries,however, is the result of both the changing role of the oil-producingcountries within the world economy and the changes in Egypt's agrarianand migration policies during the 1970's which led to increasing intersectoraland intrasectoral inequalities that triggered peasant migration. Also,migration from the village to the oil-producing countries is a patternof behavior unique to small peasant producers.</TEXT></DOC>
