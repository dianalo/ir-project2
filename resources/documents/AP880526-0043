By a voice vote, the Senate on Wednesday approved legislation tooutlaw the manufacture, sale or possession of handguns made fromplastic or other ``undetectable'' parts that could evade metaldetectors.   The measure primarily is directed at terrorists and airplanehijackers, but was amended to include a requirement that all toyguns have orange plugs in their barrels to clearly identify them astoys.   ``This bill is designed to prevent a nightmare from becomingreality,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who co-sponsoredthe legislation with Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.   ``Its aim is to keep terrorists from getting powerful,undetectable firearms which could be smuggled past security devicesat airports, courtrooms and even the White House,'' Metzenbaum said.   The plastic gun ban is similar to legislation approved by theHouse, 413-4, earlier this month. Differences between the two billswill have to be ironed out before the gun ban is sent to PresidentReagan for his signature.   The nation's major law enforcement groups lobbied heavily forthe legislation, and worked out the compromise language withAttorney General Edwin Meese III. The National Rifle Association,after initial reluctance, went along with the approach.   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, a sponsor of theamendment to clearly identify toy guns, said realistic plastic guns``have been used in the commission of crimes, such as bank robbery,hostage takings and street crime.''   Dole also recalled that in one case, ``a police officer inCalifornia accidentally shot a youth playing with a toy laser gun,after mistaking the toy for a firearm.''   An amendment by Metzenbaum added provisions that would make it acrime to possess a firearm in a federal courtroom, increasepenalties for possession of explosives in airports and boostpenalties for use or possession of explosives in commission of afederal felony.   The Senate legislation would require that all firearms be asdetectable as a 3.7-ounce stainless steel handgun. All gunscurrently manufactured or imported into the United States wouldhave to meet the test.   While the Senate bill sets a detectability standard, theHouse-passed measure requires that the gun itself contain 3.7ounces of metal.   The Senate measure also would require that new, state-of-the-artmetal detectors be used at airports, federal courthouses and otherfederal security checkpoints. The House bill does not include themetal detector provision.</TEXT></DOC>
