Further extensiveresearch was done in view of further applications of colliery shales;such as the use of light weight sands from crushed small sized washeryrefuse and pelletized flotation tailings by means of thermal treatmentin a fluidized bed furnace. Thick sands are used to thermally insulatebuildings. The studies on the sutability of washery refuse in undergroundconstruction were extended to include also road construction. Fluidizedbed ash, flotation tailings and swept material from green refuse weretested for use as cement.</TEXT></DOC>
