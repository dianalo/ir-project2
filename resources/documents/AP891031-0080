Also today, masked Palestinians hacked to death a 22-year-oldwoman and wounded her sister; both were accused of cooperating withIsraeli authorities, Arab reports said.   The operation in Beit Sahour was the army's first concentratedshow of force designed to break a Palestinian tax boycott. Suchcivil disobedience has been a key element of a 22-month-olduprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories.   Beit Sahour, a predominantly Christian town of 10,000 nearBethlehem, has been a stronghold of the tax boycott.   As soldiers removed blockades, about 300 to 400 residents tookto the streets proclaiming victory and singing the Palestiniananthem, ``Biladi, Biladi,'' which means ``My country, My country.''   ``We stood up to the army, and we won,'' said one resident.   But Israel's West Bank military governor, Brig. Gen. ShaikeErez, also claimed victory, saying he was ``convinced the taxrebellion is broken,'' Israel radio reported.   For the past six weeks, foreign diplomats, church leaders,journalists and most non-residents have been barred from enteringBeit Sahour.   In a series of raids, soldiers seized property valued at $1.5million from 398 debtors, an army communique said. It said 33 motorvehicles along with cash and money in bank accounts were seized inlieu of taxes.   Forty debtors were arrested and 35 were indicted. Of these, fourwere fined $3,000 or ordered to spent 180 days in jail, themilitary said.   The English-language Jerusalem Post put the arrest total at 60.   The army communique said that because of the raids, taxboycotters elsewhere in the West Bank had come forward to pay debts.   In defense of the operation, which was widely criticized abroad,the army said ``it was intended to restore law and order and wasconducted in an organized and orderly fashion.''   The army said it launched the raids Sept. 20 after 320 residentsstopped paying their taxes.   The army announcement did not directly address numerouspublished complaints of brutality during the raids but indirectlyacknowledged soldiers may have confiscated the wrong property insome cases.   Authorities decided to lift the siege of the town aftercompleting seizures of property and arrests of those refusing topay taxes, said one security source who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   In the occupied Gaza Strip today, two sisters who worked atNasser Hospital in Khan Yunis were attacked. The victims were SeryaEl Kadi, who was hacked to death, and Sumaya El Kadi, who wasseriously injured, said Arab reporters.   The reporters said both were accused of helping authoritiesidentify Palestinian youths brought to the hospital with woundsfrom clashes with Israeli soldiers.   Palestinian activists often give false names to hospitals toavoid being arrested later by security forces on the basis ofhospital reports.   Last week, five masked attackers fatally stabbed a nurse insideNasser hospital. They scrawled slogans on a wall accusing thevictim of collaborating with Israeli security forces.   The latest slaying brings to 138 the number of Palestinianskilled by fellow Arabs in the 22-month-old uprising against Israelioccupation. Most were slain as suspected collaborators.   At least 607 Palestinians have been killed by soldiers orIsraeli civilians during the revolt, and 40 Israelis also have diedin the violence.</TEXT></DOC>
