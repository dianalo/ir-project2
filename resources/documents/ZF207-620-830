After all, there is nothing as immediate andcompelling as working with people face to face.andP;  In good action-orientedmeetings, individuals can actually become morc creative and more rationalthan they can be working alone.andP;  Taking advantage of the collectiveintelligence ofthe group, differences can be aired and resolved, prioritiesweighed, ideas developed, reflectingthe best of what each person cancontribute.andP;  What role can technology play in helping people work togetherwhen thcy are together?andM;&quot;Meetingware&quot; is the term we are coining to describe all thc technologies wccan use to make face-to-face, working meetings morc productive.andM;When a group of people has to work together, the biggest concern is keepingthc group together.andP;  It is hard enough to keep two people on track for morcthan five minutes.andP;  Each additional pcrson involved increases thc challengegeometrically.andP;  Therefore, the most common of all meetingware components are:flipcharts, whiteboards, butcher paper and overhead projectors - the device,or system of devices devoted to displaying, recording, and editing the workof the group.andM;The computer as a flipchadandM;The three basic functions of group display media arc to 1) display, 2) recordand 3) edit the work of the group.andP;  Given a large enough scrcen, the computercan be used to do all three.andP;  Not only can the computer bc used to do thesethings, but also it can perform thcsc functions so much more successfully.andO;The computer all but obsoletes its prcdecessors, providing thc working groupwith a tool that can result in a quantum leap in meeting productivity.andM;Since most group work (brainstorming, assigning priorities, developing actionitems, creating and modifying agendas) involves making lists, the kcysoftwarc component of any meetingware systcm is one that is speciallydedicated to making and organizing lists: thc outline processor.andP;  Most wordprocessing software includes an outlining capability, but the best outlinersare those that are dedicated to that function (for the Macintosh, MORE IIfrom Symantec (Symantec Corp.10201 Torre Ave.andP;  Cupertino CA 95014-2132;408253-9600), Mind Write from Delta Point (Delta Point, Inc.andP;  200 HeritageHartor, Suite G, Monterey, CA 93940; 408-648-4000), Acta from Symmetry Corp.andO;225E.andP;  First St., Mesa, AZ85201, 602-844-2199 or 1-800-624-2485; for theDOS-compatible computer, GrandView and Ready from Symantec Corp.andP;  1020I TorreAve.andP;  Cupertino,CA 95014-2132, 408-253-9600; Max Think from RelianceSoftware, 44 Rincon Road Kensington, CA 415-428-0104; PCOutline Plus fromBrown Bag Software, 2105 S.andP;  Bascom Ave., Suite 164, Campbell, CA95008,408-559-4545.andM;DisplayandM;It is almost unfair to compare the handwritten scrawl that gets displayed onthe flipchart 'With the precisely typed lines that appear on thc computcrdisplay.andP;  But that, in fact, is thc comparison that must bc made.andM;Thc Macintosh is well-known for its graphic display capabilities.andP;  Scrcenfonts can bc enlarged to whatever size is comfortable for group viewing.andO;With the use of Multifinder or windowing software for DOS-compatiblemachines, 2 or more different files can be opened at the same time andinformation copied and pasted from one to the other.andP;  Charts and graphics canbe displaycd and modified in real time as easily as text.andP;  Presentations andanimations can be shown whenever needed then edited on-scrcen and on-line, inresponse to new information.andM;RecordandM;An average typist can input 60 words a minute.andP;  It is simply impossible tohandwrite legibly at that spccd.andM;Speed can be very important, especially in brainstorming.andP;  When pcople are ona roll, bouncing new ideas back and forth, the more you have to slow thcmdown, thc more you hamper thcir creativity.andM;But thc spccd of rccording is not thc major issue.andP;  Even more crucial is thcrecord itself.andP;  The Whiteboard maybe a very good tool for recording anddisplaying new ideas, but what happens when the whiteboard is full? Ideashave to get erased to makc room for more.andP;  In the meantime, everything has tostop until somebody transcribes those ideas on to paper, or they mill be lostforever.andP;  The record can be kept, but the display of all those erased ideasis lost.andM;When a flipchart page is full, it can be torn off and taped to the wall.andP;  Itonly takes a few seconds, resulting in a relatively minor loss ofspontaneity.andP;  If enough flipcharts are available, several hours ofbrainstorming can be recorded and displayed.andP;  And thcn, when the meeting isover, people are left with a room full of flipchart pages, all of which havcto bc transcribed before they can be of any further use to the group.andM;Relying on a computer, however, thc group never runs out of room for itsidcas.andP;  There is never any reason to stop the flow to attend to increasinglydifficult logistics of tearing and taping.andP;  And, most significantly, ahardcopy report of the collected wisdom of thc group can be printed, copied,and in everyone's hands bcfore the meeting is adjourned.andP;  EditandM;In an action-oriented meeting, ideas are not just recorded, but also workedwith, elaborated upon, refined, massaged.andP;  Traditionally, this is the mostdifficult of all tasks facing the group, because the traditional mediaavailable to the group is the most intractable.andM;Using the flipchart, words get crossed out, written over, arrows drawn andredrawn, generally resulting in a scarcely legible visual and conceptualpuzzle that borders on indecipherability.andM;Thc whiteboard, because it is so casy to erase, is, compared to theflipchart, a far superior medium for working with idcas.andP;  On the other hand,it is only possible to work with as many ideas as can fit on the limiteddisplay surface of thc whiteboard, and, once something is erased, it isirretricvable.andM;Thc computer clearly performs all three functions of group display media withgreater efficiency than its predecessors, Of the three functions considercd,the advantages of the computer are most obvious when examining therequirements of editing.andP;  Using search and replace, cut, copy and paste, thecomputer operator can transform pages of unrelated ideas into a cohesive,formatted, spell- checked whole.andM;and Beyond ...andM;So far, we have only been dealing with the computer's use in handling text.andO;We examined each of the main functions of traditional group media anddiscovered, in every case that thc computcr has clear advantages.andP;  However,when we contemplate using the computer actually to compute, there are noprecedents to examine.andM;When it is time to resolve budgetary issues, working collaboratively on a&quot;live&quot; spreadsheet, the group can do far more than discuss the pros and consof shifting money around.andP;  Collectively, the group can use the spreadshcet tocreate an endless varicty of &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios, challenging, changing, andcharting the effects of a multitude of possibilities.andP;  Any contemplatedchangc can be projected immediately, its consequences calculated and madeexplicit for all to weigh.andP;  Using the latest data, any budgetary decision canbe made in an intelligent and informed manner.andM;Project planning and scheduling software, graphic design and modeling tools,virtually any use of the computer, brings a repertoire of valued capabilitiesto the action-oriented meeting.andM;The computer not only brings new computing abilities to the group, it alsoprovides a gateway to other individuals and groups and whole databases ofinformation.andP;  Using the computer as a communications tool, it becomespossible to invite participation in thc action-oriented mccting fromvirtually anyone, anywhere in the world.andP;  Meeting proceedings can bedistributed electronically within minutes after the meeting is over.andO;Information that is inacccssible to group members can be made availableimmediately to the working group, brought from corporate or commercialdatabases directly into the meeting room.andP;  Options and LimitationsandM;There are several ways of projecting a computer image so that the screen islarge enough for all people to share.andP;  One ofthe most obvious is to use alarge enough monitor.andP;  For small meetings (ranging in size from 2-8), aworkstation monitor might be all you need.andP;  Using either a landscape,portrait or two-page monitor and a large enough screen font, you have anideal environment for the small group.andP;  The larger screen gives you theopportunity to display more information.andP;  The larger the group, the largerthc font you 'hill need, and the less information you will be able to displayon a single screen without scrolling or paging through.andM;There are also monitors, such as the Mitsubishi, Electrohome, Conrac, and NECMultisync, which are simply larger versions of normal size screens.andP;  Ratherthan displaying more information, thcy dispity the same amount of information,larger.andP;  A 39&quot; Mitsubishi monitor connected to a Macintosh SE displaysprecisely the same information that you would sec on thc 9&quot; Macintosh scrcen.andO;These magnifying monitors make it possible for more people to read thescreen, even without using larger fonts.andP;  In general, the Macintosh, becauseof its WYSIWYG architecture, works well as a small group monitor regardlessof monitor type.andP;  The DOS-compatible computer, without some kind of windowingsoftware, is bcst viewed on a manifying monitor or projector.andM;There are two other technologies for producing a magnified monitor image: thecomputer projector and the transparent LCD plate.andP;  The LCD plate (availablefrom Kodak, Computer Accessories, Telex, nView InFocus, and other vendors) isa transparent Liquid Crystal Display computer scrcen.andP;  Because it istransparent, another light source, the overhead projector, is used tocomplete the system.andP;  Of the two technologies, the computer projector is themore expensive and less transportable.andP;  It can project in color and can alsobe used to display information from standard NTSC video sources.andP;  Compatiblevideo projectors are available from a variety of manufacturers, including:Eketrohome, Sony, JBL, Mitsubishi, Panasonic, Barco, GE, and Hughes, Both GEand Hughes market a projector using light-valve technology.andP;  This isexpensive and cumbersome, but permits thc display of a wall-sized image innormal room fighting.andM;With the exception of the Hughes and GE Talaria, computer projectontechnologies work best under special lighting conditions.andP;  The mainadvantages of using computer monitors are that they 1) can be used in normalroom lighting, 2) have a clearer, sharper display, and 3) can be chainedtogether to be used in a variety of configurations.andP;  For example, 3 or 4monitors can be linked together and placed in the center of a circularseating arrangement, as shown in the diagram on page 7.andP;  In thisconfiguration, everyone in the mccting can see a monitor as well as havedirect eye contact with all other participants.andP;  Using a computer projector,only theater-style seating is practical.andM;The LCD plate is, however, wonderfully transportable; small enough to fit ina brief case.andP;  Because it uses an overhead projector, it has the addedadvantage of appearing much less &quot;high-tech&quot; than computer monitors orprojcctors.andP;  The overhead projector is something that most people have seensince kindergarten.andP;  Evcn though it is being used to display astate-of-the-art computer image, it still looks like an overhead proector.andM;Most projectors, computer monitors and LCD plates plug in directly toDOScompatible computers through the RGB port.andP;  As expected, there arecompatibility issues relating to the differcnt types of DOS-compatiblecomputer video output (CGA, EGA and VGA) and the vendor must be careful tomatch the appropriate version of the projection device to the vidco outputtechnology.andM;An even greater challenge faces Macintosh users as neither the Mac Plus northe SE series has a video out port.andP;  To take advantage of projectiontechnologies, the dealer or user will have to make a special modification tothe Macintosh.andP;  Vjdco adapters for both thc Macintosh and DOS-relatedtechnologies are available from Extron and Covid.andP;  Manufacturers of LCDplates for the Macintosh generally include the necessary hardwarc, but thetechnology is difficult cnough to install to make it beyond thc capabilitiesof most purchasers.andM;Meetingware vendors, therefore, can improve their offerings (and increasetheir sales) by providing customers with a complete, dedicated packagc,preconfigured for specific applications.andP;  This packagc can include everythingfrom the, recommended computer (specially adapted DOS-compatible or Macintoshcomputer, with sufficient memory and output capabilities, portable ordesktop, depending on use) to the software, modern, projector, scrcen,printer and copier.andP;  Everyday Meetings, Computer-EnhancedandM;Any time you are mceting withsomeonc in your office, you can use yourpersonal computer to enhance the productivity ofthe encounter.andP;  All you needis a large enough monitor(13&quot; or more), your PC, and a printer.andP;  Even thoughthe purpose of the meeting, at least from the perspective of the people youarc meeting with, is to discuss something, or fill in some details, or verifya plan, you can use your technology to make the meeting shorter and far moreefficient.andM;These everyday meeting can and should be action-oriented.andP;  Sharing a screentogether, you work with team members or vendors to identify purposes andproblems, and to record possible solutions.andP;  You interview people, typingquestions and answers onto the large screen for feedback and validation.andO;Working together, you define the problem.andP;  As you identify the problem, youexamine various solutions, pulling in from your database, records of previousmcctings and related decisions.andP;  At the appropriate time, you print thedocument.andP;  There can be no doubt about the resolutions reached or thecommitments made, with the hard copy in hand.andM;When the meeting is over, you and the people you meet with have experiencedeach other not as manager and managed, but as collaborating professionals.andO;At the samc time you have made exceptional use of your management skills,bringing focus and clarity to thc conversation, providing immediate feedbackand support as needed.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
