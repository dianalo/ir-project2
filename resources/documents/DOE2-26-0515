The ion yield, theenergy spectrum of the photoelectrons and their angular distributionswere measured. The angular distributions at {lambda} = 355 nm and {lambda}= 532 nm provide a sensitive test for theoretical calculations. Comparisonwith the calculations available shows that perturbation theory with properinclusion of atomic structure yields results which agree with experiment.Intensity dependent changes of angular distributions at {lambda} = 532nm are observed, which indicate that at 10/sup 13/ W cm/sup -2/ higherorder processes become noticeable. At {lambda} = 1064 nm the situationis more complicated, experimentally as well as theoretically. Intensitiesof some 10/sup 13/ W cm/sup -2/ are necessary to observe ionization.Strong distortions of the atomic structure can be expected. Presentlyonly quantitative aspects of the angular distributions can be discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
