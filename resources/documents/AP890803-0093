Thornburgh said a new policy of prosecuting officials who leakdetails of criminal investigations for theft of government propertydoes not include charging reporters with aiding and abetting orreceiving such information.   ``The statute clearly calls for prosecution of those involved inmisusing sensitive information that comes to them in an officialcapacity,'' he said.   ``Previous policy was not to use that authority. We have changedthat because of reasons I've stated more often then you want tohear,'' the attorney general said at a news conference.   Accurate leaks ``have a tendency to compromise ongoinginvestigations,'' he said. ``If they are inaccurate, they have atendency to unjustifiably smear the reputations of persons who arethe subject of the leak.''   The revision of the department's 11-year-old policy, intended toprotect whistleblowers and reporters from prosecution, wasannounced Wednesday in testimony submitted to Congress.   News reporters might be questioned about their sources in agrand jury, under the policy, if the attorney general approves thesubpoena. Attorneys general historically have been reluctant tosubpoena reporters _ often the only source of information aboutnews leaks.   But civil libertarians said it could pose dangers for reporters'First Amendment protections to protect confidential sources.   Jane Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters Committee forFreedom of the Press, said today, ``While I certainly am pleased tohear Mr. Thornburgh say he does not intend to prosecute journalistswho are the recipients of leaked information, I'm very troubled bythe probable implications of his plan to prosecute leakers.''   ``Once the government is able to say `we need this informationbecause it's materal to a criminal investigation,' that raises thequestion of whether or not the protection of a confidential sourceis diluted,'' said Allan Adler, a Washington media lawyer andformer legislative counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union.   Adler suggested the policy might be a first step towardprosecuting journalists for aiding and abetting theft of governmentinformation or illegally receiving it.   But Thornburgh denied that was contemplated. ``I think that wasmade clear,'' he said.   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciaryconstitutional and civil rights subcommittee, ``I think it would bea definite misuse of the statute. The statute was not designed withthat in mind at all.''   Edwards said the law ``has to do with stealing governmentproperty. It doesn't have to do with leaks.''   The Justice Department's 1978 policy said it was inappropriateto prosecute an official for theft of property if the case involvedgovernment information obtained in an otherwise legal way andleaked to inform the public.   John C. Keeney, a deputy assistant attorney general in thecriminal division, said in written testimony submitted to acongressional hearing, ``We have recently re-examined the policyand concluded it is too broad. Accordingly, it is no longerapplicable to government employees who leak information obtainedfrom a criminal investigation.''   Keeney said it may also be applied ``in leak cases not arisingout of a criminal investigation if the employee's conduct alsoviolated some other provision such as the Privacy Act.''   This could include the criminal investigation of leaks ofderogatory information collected during an FBI backgroundinvestigation of someone being considered for a Cabinet post.   Keeney said the ``department is in the process of decidingwhether the policy should be changed in other respects.''   Keeney submitted his statement at a hearing convened in the wakeof congressional criticism of leaks about an FBI investigation ofthe office of Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa.   The Justice Department, which has said Gray is not a target ofthe probe, has begun a leak investigation in response to thosecomplaints.   Leslie Harris, legislative counsel at the ACLU, called Keeney'sannouncement ``rather disturbing.''   ``The question is whether they in fact intend to broaden it andintend to use it as an official secrecy act, whenever they see fit.We are going to be taking a look at this very carefully,'' she said.   Former Pentagon employee Daniel Ellsberg was the firstgovernment official prosecuted under the theft statute for leakingthe Pentagon Papers study of the Vietnam War. His case wasdismissed in 1973 because of prosecutorial misconduct.</TEXT></DOC>
