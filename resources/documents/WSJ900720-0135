There is one point on which I would very much liketo hear from Mr. Magowan. He was the chief executive of thecompany for many years prior to the leveraged buy-out, duringwhich time, according to his letter, labor costs were out ofline. Mr. Magowan justifies his action after the LBO as&quot;taking the painful measures you know are necessary to ensurethe health of the business in the future,&quot; and on behalf of&quot;shareholder value.&quot; Why did it take the Hafts and an LBO toenable the chief executive of the company to address its mostcritical problem? If he had taken those actions while thecompany was publicly owned, other shareholders would havederived the value.   This is an underlying question and argument that hasbedeviled the LBO picture generally. Perhaps Mr. Magowan canhelp clarify the matter.</LP><TEXT>   Harold M. Williams   President and CEO   J.
