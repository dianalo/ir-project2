In the past several weeks, investors interested in speculating on a turnaround in Texas have been making a pitch to buy some of the state's troubled thrifts. Some are approaching thrift owners directly, but most of them are calling on thrift-industry regulators in seeking to take control of an Sandamp;L. The investors also want the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to cover any of the Sandamp;Ls' losses from past loans.    The latest potential buyers include Citicorp, which told federal thrift regulators here that it has renewed its interest in acquiring possibly several Sandamp;Ls as a way to break into Texas with a full range of banking services.    The big New York banking company has long wanted to plunge into Texas. When Texas passed an interstate-banking law last year, Citicorp considered buying a Houston banking company and some of the state's larger thrifts, but got cold feet because of the economic troubles in the Southwest.    In addition, two Texas investors with ties to H. Ross Perot and Fort Worth's Bass family have proposed a private investment plan backed by some federal guarantees. Morton H. Meyerson, a longtime associate of Mr. Perot, and Richard E. Rainwater, a former adviser and partner to some of the Bass brothers, told regulators that they plan to raise as much as $300 million to take control of several failing Texas Sandamp;Ls.    &quot;We're willing to entertain all reasonable offers to take troubled thrifts off our hands,&quot; said Lawrence J. White, a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates thrifts.    Proposals from Citicorp and Messrs. Meyerson and Rainwater come as the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas begins a top management change. Moreover, the bank is struggling to come up with a plan to deal with at least two dozen Texas Sandamp;Ls that are still open but insolvent.    At the Dallas bank's annual meeting Friday, its president, Roy G. Green, said he would like to close, merge or sell the approximately 10% of Texas's 280 Sandamp;Ls that he described as &quot;hopelessly insolvent.&quot; Mr. Green is leaving the post this fall to run a California thrift.    H. Joe Selby, an executive vice president of the Dallas bank, said he is considering proposals to create thrift holding companies, capitalized by the FSLIC or by private investors, that would acquire several ailing institutions, centralize management, combine some operations, restructure others or liquidate them. Mr. Selby said the holding company concept is being considered by the Bank Board.    The interest in Texas Sandamp;Ls arises as Congress is readying a bill to raise $8.5 billion to recapitalize the ailing FSLIC, the thrift insurance arm of the Bank Board. At least part of those funds are expected to reach federal thrift regulators this fall. The FSLIC is drawing up plans to determine how it will use the funds, which Sandamp;Ls it will close and which thrifts it will try to marry up with possible buyers and investors such as Citicorp.    Mr. White of the Bank Board said, &quot;We're working on a prioritization structure to make make sure that we spend funds in a cost-effective manner.&quot; He added that &quot;substantial sums&quot; will be targeted in Texas.    As a result, investors are looking over acquisition candidates in Texas and, &quot;there is considerably more tire-kicking going on than there has been in the last several years,&quot; says Michael E. Buquoi, chief executive of Bristol Capital Co., a Dallas thrift consultant. </TEXT></DOC>
