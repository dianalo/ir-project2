Summary of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 and theLand Disposal Restrictions Framework <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Statutory Requirements </ITAG>The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA), enacted on November 8,1984, prohibit the land disposal of hazardous wastes. Specifically, theamendments specify dates when particular groups of hazardous wastes areprohibited from land disposal unless ``it has been demonstrated to theAdministrator, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that there will beno migration of hazardous constituents from the disposal unit or injectionzone for as long as the wastes remain hazardous'' (RCRA sections 3004 (d)(1),(e)(1), (g)(5); 42 U.S.C. 6924 (d)(1), (e)(1), (g)(5)). Congress establisheda separate schedule for restricting the disposal by underground injectionof solvent- and dioxin-containing hazardous wastes, wastes referred tocollectively as California list hazardous wastes (RCRA section 3004(f)(2),42 U.S.C. 6924(f)(2)), and soil and debris resulting from CERCLA sections104 and 106 response actions and RCRA corrective actions when the soiland debris contains listed spent solvent, dioxin, and California list hazardouswastes. The amendments also require the Agency to set ``levels or methods of treatment,if any, which substantially diminish the toxicity of the waste or substantiallyreduce the likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents from the wasteso that short-term and long-term threats to human health and the environmentare minimized'' (RCRA section 3004(m)(1), 42 U.S.C. 6924(m)(1)). Wastesthat meet treatment standards established by EPA are not prohibited andmay be land disposed. In addition, a hazardous waste that does not meetthe treatment standard may be land disposed provided the ``no migration''demonstration specified in RCRA sections 3004 (d)(1), (e)(1) and (g)(5)is made. For the purposes of the restrictions, HSWA defines land disposal ``to include,but not be limited to, any placement of * * * hazardous waste in a landfill,surface impoundment, waste pile, injection well, land treatment facility,salt dome formation, salt bed formation, or underground mine or cave''(RCRA section 3004(k), 42 U.S.C. 6924(k)). Therefore, because HSWA definesland disposal to include underground injection wells, disposal of hazardouswastes in injection wells is subject to the land disposal restrictions.The land disposal restrictions are effective when promulgated unless theAdministrator grants a national variance from the statutory date and establishesa different date (not to exceed two years beyond the statutory deadline)based on ``the earliest date on which adequate alternative treatment, recovery,or disposal capacity which protects human health and the environment willbe available'' (RCRA section 3004(h)(2), 42 U.S.C. 6924(h)(2)). The Administratormay also grant a case-by-case extension of the effective date for up toone year, renewable once for up to one additional year, when an applicantsuccessfully makes certain demonstrations (RCRA section 3004(h)(3), 42U.S.C. 6924(h)(3)). A case-by-case extension can be granted whether ornot a national capacity variance has been granted. The statute also allows treatment of hazardous wastes in surface impoundmentsthat meet certain minimum technological requirements (or certain exceptionsthereto). Treatment in surface impoundments is permissible provided thetreatment residues that do not meet the treatment standard(s) (or applicablestatutory prohibition levels) are ``removed for subsequent management withinone year of the entry of the waste into the surface impoundment'' (RCRAsection 3005(j)(11)(B), 42 U.S.C. 6925(j)(11)(B)). In addition to prohibiting the land disposal of hazardous wastes, Congressprohibited storage of any waste which is prohibited from land disposalunless ``such storage is solely for the purpose of the accumulation ofsuch quantities of hazardous waste as are necessary to facilitate properrecovery, treatment or disposal'' (RCRA section 3004(j), 42 U.S.C. 6924(j)).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Applicability to Injected Wastes </ITAG>As noted above, disposal of hazardous wastes in injection wells is subjectto the provisions of HSWA. The Agency has previously proposed and promulgatedregulations pertaining to injected wastes separately from regulations addressingwastes disposed in surface facilities. The Agency chose this approach forseveral reasons. First, injection of hazardous wastes is controlled bytwo statutes, RCRA and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The regulationsgoverning injection of these wastes have been codified along with otherregulations of the Underground Injection Control (UIC) program under theSDWA in Parts 124, 144, 145, 146 and 147 of the Code of Federal Regulations.EPA believes that it is useful to the regulated community and to the Stateregulators to have requirements regarding restrictions on hazardous wasteinjection located in the same portion of the Code of Federal Regulationsas are other requirements pertaining to injection wells. Second, the statuteestablished a separate schedule for the restrictions on injection of certainwastes. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Solvents and Dioxins </ITAG>Effective November 8, 1986, HSWA prohibited land disposal (except by undergroundinjection into deep wells) of dioxin-containing hazardous wastes numberedF020, F021, F022, and F023 and solvent-containing hazardous wastes numberedF001, F002, F003, F004, and F005 listed in 40 CFR 261.31. (RCRA section3004 (e)(1), (e)(2), 42 U.S.C. 6924 (e)(1), (e)(2)). On November 7, 1986, EPA promulgated a final rule (51 FR 40572) implementingRCRA section 3004(e). This rule not only established the general frameworkfor the land disposal restrictions program, but also established treatmentstandards for the F001-F005 solvent wastes and F020-F023 and F026-F028dioxin-containing wastes. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. California List Wastes </ITAG>Effective July 8, 1987, the statute prohibited further land disposal (exceptby deep well injection) of the following listed or identified wastes (RCRAsection 3001) set out in RCRA sections 3004 (d)(1) and (d)(2) (42 U.S.C.6924 (d)(1), (d)(2)).<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) Liquid hazardous wastes, including free liquids associated withany solid or sludge, containing free cyanides at concentrations greaterthan or equal to 1,000 mg/l. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) Liquid hazardous wastes, including free liquids associated withany solid or sludge, containing the following metals (or elements) or compoundsof these metals (or elements) at concentrations greater than or equal tothose specified below: (i) Arsenic and/or compounds (as As) 500 mg/l; (ii)Cadmium and/or compounds (as Cd) 100 mg/l; (iii) Chromium (VI and/or compounds(as Cr VI)) 500 mg/l; (iv) Lead and/or compounds (as Pb) 500 mg/l; (v)Mercury and/or compounds (as Hg) 20 mg/l; (vi) Nickel and/or compounds(as Ni) 134 mg/l; (vii) Selenium and/or compounds (as Se) 100 mg/l; and(viii) Thallium and/or compounds (as Tl) 130 mg/l. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) Liquid hazardous waste having a pH less than or equal to two (2.0).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(D) Liquid hazardous wastes containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)at concentrations greater than or equal to 50 ppm. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(E) Hazardous wastes containing halogenated organic compounds (HOCs)in total concentration greater than or equal to 1,000 mg/kg.</ITAG>On July 8, 1987, EPA promulgated a final rule (52 FR 25760) implementingRCRA section 3004(d). This rule established treatment standards for Californialist wastes containing PCBs and certain HOCs, and codified the statutoryprohibition on liquid corrosive wastes. The statutory prohibition is ineffect for the California list wastes containing free cyanides, metals,and the California list dilute HOC wastewaters. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Disposal of Solvents, Dioxins and California List Wastes in InjectionWells </ITAG>Section 3004(f) of RCRA required that the Administrator prohibit the disposalof solvents, dioxins and California List wastes in deep wells, effectiveAugust 8, 1988, unless such disposal had been determined to be protectiveof human health and the environment for as long as the wastes remainedhazardous or unless a variance had been granted under RCRA section 3004(h).On July 26, 1988, the Agency established effective dates for the prohibitionon injection of solvents and dioxin wastes (53 FR 28118). In another regulation,effective August 6, 1988 and published August 16, 1988 in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Agency established effective dates for theprohibition on injection of California List wastes (53 FR 30908). <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Scheduled Wastes </ITAG>The amendments required the Agency to prepare a schedule by November 8,1986 for restricting the land disposal of all hazardous wastes, includingunderground injected wastes, listed or identified as of November 8, 1984in 40 CFR Part 261, excluding solvent- and dioxin-containing wastes andCalifornia list wastes covered under the schedule set by Congress. Theschedule, based on a ranking of the listed wastes that considers theirintrinsic hazard and their volume, is to ensure that prohibitions and treatmentstandards are promulgated first for high volume hazardous wastes with highintrinsic hazard before standards are set for low volume wastes with lowintrinsic hazard. The statute further requires that these determinationsbe made by the following deadlines: (A) At least one-third of all listed hazardous wastes by August 8, 1988.(B) At least two-thirds of all listed hazardous wastes by June 8, 1989.(C) All remaining listed hazardous wastes and all hazardous wastes identifiedas of November 8, 1984, by one or more of the characteristics defined in40 CFR Part 261 by May 8, 1990. If EPA fails to set a treatment standard by the statutory deadline forany hazardous waste in the first third or second third of the schedule,the waste may be disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment provided``such facility'' is in compliance with the minimum technological requirementsspecified in RCRA section 3004(o) for new facilities (RCRA section 3004(g)(6)).(<T4>Note._</T4>In the August 17, 1988 First Third final rule, EPA interpretedthe term ``such facility'' in 3004(g)(6) to refer to the individual surfaceimpoundment or landfill unit.) In addition, prior to disposal, the generatormust certify to the Administrator that he has investigated the availabilityof treatment capacity and has determined that disposal in such landfillor surface impoundment is the only practical alternative to treatment currentlyavailable to the generator. This restriction on the use of landfills andsurface impoundments applies until EPA sets a treatment standard for thewaste or until May 8, 1990, whichever is sooner. Other forms of land disposal,including underground injection, are not similarly restricted and may continueto be used for disposal of untreated wastes until EPA promulgates a treatmentstandard or until May 8, 1990, whichever is sooner. If the Agency failsto set a treatment standard for any scheduled hazardous waste by May 8,1990, the waste is automatically prohibited from all forms of land disposalafter that time unless the waste is the subject of a successful ``no migration''demonstration (RCRA section 3004(g)(5), 42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(5)). (Also, theMay 8, 1990 effective date may be extended under RCRA section 3004(h)(2)for certain Second Third and Third Third wastes, and until August 8, 1990for certain First Third wastes.) On May 28, 1986, EPA promulgated the schedulefor setting treatment standards for the listed and identified hazardouswastes (51 FR 19300). All wastes that are identified as hazardous by characteristicare scheduled in the Third Third, as required by RCRA. This schedule isincorporated in 40 CFR 268.10, 268.11, and 268.12. For the scheduled wastes, the statute does not provide different deadlinesfor restriction of underground injected versus surface land disposed wastes.However, the Agency did propose and promulgate First Third regulationsfor surface disposed and injected wastes on separate dates. The First Thirdfinal rule, promulgated on August 8, 1988 and published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31138), set out theconditions under which wastes included in the first one-third of the scheduleof restricted hazardous wastes listed in 40 CFR 268.10 may continue tobe land disposed (other than by injection). The final regulations publishedAugust 26, 1988 (53 FR 30908) include effective dates for the prohibitionof injection of certain First Third wastes. In addition, the Agency hasproposed effective dates for the prohibition on injection of another groupof First Third wastes on October 26, 1988 (53 FR 41601). Today's noticeproposes the conditions under which wastes included in the second one-thirdof the schedule of restricted hazardous wastes listed in 40 CFR 268.11may continue to be land disposed. It applies to all forms of land disposal,including injection. It also proposes treatment standards for some restrictedhazardous wastes listed in andSection;andSection; 268.10 and 268.12 (FirstThird and Third Third wastes).<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Newly Identified and Listed Wastes </ITAG>RCRA requires the Agency to make a land disposal prohibition determinationfor any hazardous waste that is newly identified or listed in 40 CFR Part261 after November 8, 1984 within six months of the date of identificationor listing (RCRA section 3004(g)(4), 42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(4)). However, thestatute does not provide for an automatic prohibition of the land disposalof such wastes if EPA fails to meet this deadline. B. Regulatory Framework By way of preface, we note that the following description of existing rulesis for the readers' convenience, and is not intended to reopen any of theserules for public comment. The November 7, 1986 final rule (51 FR 40572)established the regulatory framework for implementing the land disposalrestrictions program. Some changes to the framework were made in a July8, 1987, final rule (52 FR 25760) that prohibited the land disposal ofCalifornia list wastes, as well as in the August 17, 1988 final rule. Regulationsspecifying how the framework applies to injected wastes were promulgatedJuly 26, 1988 (53 FR 28118). The following discussion summarizes the majorprovisions of the land disposal restrictions framework. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Applicability </ITAG>The land disposal restrictions apply prospectively to the affected wastes.In other words, hazardous wastes land disposed after the applicable effectivedates are subject to the restrictions, but wastes land disposed prior tothe effective dates are not required to be removed or exhumed for treatment(51 FR 40577). Similarly, only surface impoundments receiving restrictedwastes after the applicable deadline are subject to the restrictions ontreatment in surface impoundments contained in andSection; 268.4 and 3005(j)(11).Also, the storage restrictions apply to wastes placed in storage afterthe effective dates. The provisions of the land disposal restrictions program apply to wastesproduced by generators of greater than 1,000 kilograms of hazardous wasteas well as small quantity generators of 100 to 1,000 kilograms of hazardouswaste (or greater than 1 kilogram of acute hazardous waste) in a calendarmonth. However, wastes produced by small quantity generators of less than100 kilograms of hazardous waste (or less than 1 kilogram of acute hazardouswaste) per calendar month are conditionally exempt from RCRA, includingthe land disposal restrictions (see 40 CFR 268.1). The land disposal restrictions apply to both interim status and permittedfacilities. The requirements of the land disposal restrictions programsupersede 40 CFR 270.4(a), which currently provides that compliance witha RCRA permit constitutes compliance with Subtitle C of RCRA. Therefore,even though the requirements may not be specified in the permit conditions,all permitted facilities are subject to the restrictions. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Treatment Standards </ITAG>By each statutory deadline the Agency must establish the applicable treatmentstandards under 40 CFR Part 268 Subpart D for each restricted hazardouswaste (RCRA section 3004(m)(1)). After the applicable effective dates,restricted wastes may be land disposed in Subtitle C facilities if theymeet the treatment standards. If EPA does not promulgate treatment standardsby the statutory deadlines, such wastes are prohibited from land disposal(with the exception of first-third and second-third ranked hazardous wastes,which are subject to the soft hammer provisions of RCRA section 3004(g)(6)).A treatment standard is based on the performance of the best demonstratedavailable technology (BDAT) to treat the waste (51 FR 40578). EPA may establishtreatment standards either as specific technologies or as performance standardsbased on the performance of BDAT technologies. Compliance with performancestandards may be monitored by measuring the concentration level of thehazardous constituents (or in some circumstances, indicator pollutants)in the waste, treatment residual, or in the extract of the waste or treatmentresidual. When treatment standards are set as performance levels, the regulatedcommunity may use any technology not otherwise prohibited (such as impermissibledilution) to treat the waste to meet the treatment standard. Treaters thusare not limited to only those technologies considered in determining thetreatment standard. However, when treatment standards are expressed asspecific technologies, such technologies must be employed. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. National Variances From the Effective Dates </ITAG>The Agency has the authority to grant national variances from the statutoryeffective dates, not to exceed two years, if there is insufficient alternativeprotective treatment, recovery or disposal capacity for the wastes (RCRAsection 3004(h)(2)). To make capacity determinations, EPA compares thenationally available alternative treatment, recovery, or protective disposalcapacity at permitted and interim status facilities which will be in operationby the effective date with the quantity of restricted waste generated.If there is a significant shortage of such capacity nationwide, EPA willestablish an alternative effective date based on the earliest date suchcapacity will be available. During the period such a capacity varianceis in place, if the waste is disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment,such disposal may be made only in a unit meeting the minimum technologicalrequirements of RCRA section 3004(o) (53 FR 31186 and andSection; 268.5(h)(2)).It should be noted, however, that if a waste subject to a national capacityvariance is treated to meet the applicable treatment standard, it may bedisposed in a Subtitle C landfill or surface impoundment regardless ofwhether the unit meets minimum technological requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Case-By-Case Extensions of the Effective Dates </ITAG>The Agency will consider granting up to a one-year extension (renewableonly once) of a ban effective date on a case-by-case basis. The requirementsoutlined in 40 CFR 268.5 must be satisfied, including a demonstration thatadequate alternative treatment, recovery, or disposal capacity for thepetitioner's waste cannot reasonably be made available by the effectivedate due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control, and that thepetitioner has entered into a binding contractual commitment to constructor otherwise provide such capacity. During the period that such a case-by-caseextension is in place, the waste may be land disposed only in a unit meetingthe minimum technological requirements of RCRA section 3004(o).<ITAG tagnum="81">5. ``No Migration'' Exemptions From the Restrictions </ITAG>EPA has the authority to allow the land disposal of a restricted hazardouswaste which does not meet the treatment standard provided that the petitionerdemonstrates that there will be no migration of hazardous constituentsfrom the disposal unit or injection zone for as long as the waste remainshazardous (40 CFR 268.6). If a petition is granted, it can remain in effectfor no longer than ten years for disposal in interim status land disposalunits, and for no longer than the term of the RCRA permit for disposalin permitted units (40 CFR 268.6(h)). Section 148.20 (promulgated on July 26, 1988, see 53 FR 28118) outlinesin detail the Agency's plan for implementing the ``no migration'' provisionsof RCRA with respect to injected wastes. Briefly, a petitioner is required,through modeling, to demonstrate that there is no migration of hazardousconstituents from the injection zone for as long as the waste remains hazardous.This demonstration can be made in one of two ways: the use of flow andtransport models to show that injected fluids will not migrate verticallyout of the injection zone for a period of 10,000 years; or, use of geochemicalmodeling to show that the waste is transformed so it will become nonhazardousat the edge of the injection zone. Also, a showing must be made that thewell was in compliance with the substantive area of review, correctiveaction, and mechanical integrity requirements of Part 146. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Variances From the Treatment Standards </ITAG>EPA established the variance from the treatment standard to account forthose wastes that can not be treated to meet the applicable treatment standards,even if well-designed and well-operated BDAT treatment systems are used(40 CFR 268.44). This variance is somewhat analogous to the fundamentallydifferent factors variance in the Agency's Clean Water Act effluent limitationsguidelines regulation. Among other things, petitions must demonstrate thatthe waste is significantly different from the wastes evaluated by EPA inestablishing the treatment standard and the waste cannot be treated tothe level or by the method specified by the treatment standard (5l FR 40605).This variance procedure can result in the establishment of a new treatabilitygroup and corresponding treatment standard that applies to all wastes meetingthe criteria of the new waste treatability group. A site-specific variancefrom the treatment standard may also be granted administratively (withoutrulemaking), but the variance has no generic applicability to other wastesat other sites (53 FR 31199). <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Exemption for Treatment in Surface Impoundments </ITAG>Wastes that would otherwise be prohibited from one or more methods of landdisposal may be treated in a surface impoundment that meets certain technologicalrequirements (40 CFR 268.4(a)(3)) as long as treatment residuals that donot meet the applicable treatment standard (or statutory prohibition levelswhere no treatment standards are established) are removed for subsequentmanagement within one year of entry into the impoundment and are not placedinto any other surface impoundment. The owner or operator of such an impoundmentmust certify to the Regional Administrator that the technical requirementshave been met and must also submit a copy of the waste analysis plan thathas been modified to provide for testing treatment residuals in accordancewith section 268.4 requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Storage of Prohibited Wastes </ITAG>Storage of prohibited wastes is prohibited except where storage is solelyfor the purpose of accumulating sufficient quantities of wastes to facilitateproper treatment, recovery, or disposal (40 CFR 268.50). A facility thatstores a prohibited waste for more than one year bears the burden of proofthat such storage is solely for this purpose. <T3>Id. </T3>EPA bears the burden of proof if the Agency believes thatstorage of a restricted waste by a facility for up to one year is not forthe purpose of accumulating sufficient quantities to facilitate propertreatment, recovery, or disposal. <T3>Id. </T3><ITAG tagnum="81">9. The ``Soft Hammer'' Provisions </ITAG>The First Third and Second Third wastes for which EPA has not promulgatedtreatment standards can continue to be disposed in landfill and surfaceimpoundment units, provided certain demonstrations are made, and providedthese units meet the minimum technology requirements of section 3004(o)(see 53 FR 31181, August 17, 1988), until May 8 1990, or until EPA promulgatestreatment standards, whichever is sooner. Other types of land disposalare not restricted until EPA promulgates treatment standards or until May8, 1990.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Today's Proposed Rule </ITAG>Today's notice describes the Agency's proposed approach to implementingRCRA section 3004(g) requirements with respect to certain listed hazardouswastes included in 40 CFR 268.11 (as well as andSection;andSection; 268.10and 268.12). The Agency is required to promulgate regulations establishingconditions under which these Second Third wastes may be land disposed bythe statutory deadline of June 8, 1989. A. Applicability of Proposed Treatment Standards Today the Agency is proposing treatment standards and effective dates foronly certain Second Third wastes. Wastes listed in andSection; 268.11 forwhich EPA does not establish treatment standards or effective dates willbe subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions that allow continued landdisposal until May 8, 1990 or until treatment standards or extensions tothe effective date are promulgated, whichever is sooner (40 CFR 268.8).The Agency is also proposing treatment standards for certain First Third``soft hammer'' wastes, as well as certain Third Third wastes, to becomeeffective immediately upon promulgation. Although the few Third Third wastesincluded in today's proposal were not originally scheduled to be regulateduntil May 8, 1990, the Agency is not precluded from proposing or promulgatingtreatment standards for any wastes ahead of schedule (see RCRA section3004(g)(1), ``Not later than * * *''). The treatment standards being proposedtoday will also apply to wastes that are disposed by deep well injection.The Agency is proposing to amend the schedule so that certain Second Thirdwastewater residues, derived-from wastes, mixtures of hazardous/radioactivewastes are moved to the third third of the schedule, as was done in theFirst Third final rule (see 53 FR 31215, andSection; 268.12 (b), (c), and(d)). The Agency is proposing to move wastewater residues resulting fromwell-designed and well-operated treatment methods (metals recovery, metalsprecipitation, cyanide destruction, carbon adsorption, chemical oxidation,steam stripping, biodegradation, and incineration or other direct thermaldestruction) for which EPA has not promulgated wastewater treatment standardsto the Third Third, in order that residues from substantial treatment ofthese ``soft hammer'' wastes may be further treated in land disposal unitsthat do not meet minimum technology requirements. As was explained in theFirst Third final rule (53 FR 31184), the Agency finds justification forsuch action in that wastes that have undergone substantial treatment tolevels that may ultimately satisfy treatment standards should not be precludedfrom further treatment in polishing or advanced biological treatment units(RCRA sections 3005 (j)(3) and (j)(13)) that are substantially protectiveof human health and the environment. The Agency is also proposing to move leachate derived from treatment, storage,or disposal of Second Third wastes for which EPA did not promulgate wastewatertreatment standards, and contaminated ground water that contains such wastes,to the Third Third. The Agency is taking this action, as was explainedin the First Third final rule (53 FR 31184), because these wastes may behighly diluted so that treatment in RCRA section 3005 (j)(3) and (j)(13)impoundments may be appropriate. Likewise, the Agency is proposing to move Second Third wastes that aremixed hazardous/radioactive wastes to the Third Third. As was explainedin the First Third final rule (53 FR 31147), there are relatively smallvolumes of such waste mixtures being generated, so such waste is more appropriatelyaddressed in the Third Third. B. Best Demonstrated Available Technologies (BDAT) Today's proposed rule defines the waste treatability groups by waste codesand identifies the Best Demonstrated Available Technology (BDAT) for eachwaste code (see Section III.A.). Treatment standards applicable to eachtreatability group are based on the performance levels achievable by thecorresponding BDAT identified for each treatability group. Any technologynot otherwise prohibited (i.e., impermissible dilution) may be used tomeet the concentration-based treatment standards. Where treatment standardsare expressed as a technology, the waste must be treated using the specifiedtechnology prior to land disposal. Following are tables listing BDAT for the wastes for which treatment standardsare proposed in today's rule:1. <T3>Incineration is identified as BDAT for the waste codes:</T3><ITAG tagnum="42">F010 andgreater;5% oil/grease </ITAG><P>F024 </P><P>K009 nonwastewater </P><P>K010 nonwastewater </P><P>K011 nonwastewater </P><P>K013 nonwastewater </P><P>K014 nonwastewater </P><P>K023 </P><P>K027 nonwastewater </P><P>K028 </P><P>K036 wastewater </P><P>K038 nonwastewater </P><P>K039 nonwastewater </P><P>K040 nonwastewater </P><P>K043 </P><P>K093 </P><P>K094 </P><P>K113 nonwastewater </P><P>K114 nonwastewater </P><P>K115 nonwastewater </P><P>K116 nonwastewater </P><P>P039 </P><P>P040 nonwastewater </P><P>P041 nonwastewater </P><P>P043 nonwastewater </P><P>P044 nonwastewater </P><P>P062 nonwastewater </P><P>P071 </P><P>P085 nonwastewater </P><P>P089 </P><P>P094 </P><P>P097 </P><P>P109 nonwastewater </P><P>P111 nonwastewater </P><P>U028 </P><P>U058 nonwastewater </P><P>U069 </P><P>U087 nonwastewater </P><P>U088 </P><P>U102 </P><P>U107 </P><P>U190 </P><P>U221 </P><P>U223 </P><P>U235</P>2. <T3>Carbon Adsorption is identified as BDAT for the waste codes:</T3><ITAG tagnum="42">K027 wastewater </ITAG><P>K113 wastewater </P><P>K114 wastewater </P><P>K115 wastewater </P><P>K116 wastewater </P><P>P040 wastewater </P><P>P041 wastewater </P><P>P043 wastewater </P><P>P044 wastewater </P><P>P062 wastewater </P><P>P085 wastewater </P><P>P109 wastewater </P><P>P111 wastewater </P><P>U058 wastewater </P><P>U087 wastewater </P><P>U221 wastewater </P><P>U223 wastewater</P>3. <T3>No Land Disposal Based on Recycling is identified as BDAT for the wastecodes:</T3><ITAG tagnum="42">K002 nonwastewater </ITAG><P>K003 nonwastewater </P><P>K004 nonwastewater </P><P>K006 nonwastewater </P><P>K008 nonwastewater </P><P>K095 nonwastewater </P><P>K096 nonwastewater</P>4. <T3>No Land Disposal Based on No Generation is identified as BDAT for thewaste codes:</T3><ITAG tagnum="42">K005 nonwastewater </ITAG><P>K007 nonwastewater </P><P>K029 nonwastewater</P>5. <T3>No Standards for the Second Third waste codes:</T3><ITAG tagnum="42">K041 </ITAG><P>K042 </P><P>K097 </P><P>K098 </P><P>K105</P>6. <T3>Electrolytic Oxidation followed by Alkaline Chlorination, Precipitation,Filtration, and Stabilization of Metals is identified as BDAT for the wastecodes:</T3><ITAG tagnum="42">F006 </ITAG><P>F012 </P><P>F019</P>7. <T3>Wet Air Oxidation Followed by Precipitation and Filtration is Identifiedas BDAT for the waste codes:</T3><ITAG tagnum="42">F007 </ITAG><P>F008 </P><P>F009 </P><P>F011 </P><P>P013 </P><P>P021 </P><P>P029 </P><P>P063 </P><P>P074 </P><P>P098 </P><P>P099 </P><P>P104 </P><P>P106 </P><P>P121</P>8. <T3>Wet Air Oxidation followed by Biological Treatment is identified asBDAT for the waste codes:</T3><ITAG tagnum="42">K011 wastewater </ITAG><P>K013 wastewater </P><P>K014 wastewater</P>C. Waste Analysis Requirements The Agency is today proposing to incorporate the approach to waste analysispromulgated in the First Third final rule (53 FR 31146). Where BDAT isa destruction or removal technology, a total waste analysis is requiredbecause it is most appropriate for measuring such destruction or removal.The legislative history also indicates a strong preference for treatmentthat destroys hazardous constituents, (see, e.g., 130 Cong. Rec., 59l79,daily ed. July 25, 1984, statement of Senator Chaffee), and the only reliableway to verify that destruction has occurred is to measure the total waste.Similarly, where BDAT is identified as an immobilization technology suchas stabilization, analysis of a TCLP waste extract is required becauseit is the most appropriate measure of immobilization. In cases where bothtechnologies are identified as BDAT, both types of waste analyses are required.In order for the initial generator to determine whether his waste meetsthe applicable treatment standard as generated, he should analyze the totalwaste if a treatment standard is in andSection; 268.41, or he should analyzea waste extract if the treatment standard is found in andSection; 268.43(see proposed andSection; 268.34(f)). The generator may also make this determinationbased on his knowledge of the waste (see andSection; 268.7(a)), providedthere is a reasonable basis for doing so (for example, the generator usesso little of a key constituent that it could not be found in the wasteat levels exceeding a treatment standard). The Agency has discussed thisprinciple in past rulemakings, and is not reopening it for comment here.The Agency notes that a mistake was made in andSection; 268.33(g) of theregulatory language of the First Third final rule. The Agency inadvertentlyomitted language that allowed the initial waste generator to use knowledgeof the waste for purposes of determining whether a hazardous waste exceedsthe applicable treatment standards. It was not the intent of the Agencyto change the waste analysis provision of andSection; 268.7(a) to disallowuse of generator knowledge of the waste. This error will be corrected ina technical correction notice for the First Third. D. Nationwide Variances From the Effective Date Due to lack of sufficient alternative protective treatment or recoverycapacity, EPA is proposing a national capacity variance for soil and debriscontaminated with some of the waste codes covered by today's notice. Avariance is also proposed for certain wastes disposed by underground deepwell injection. Such determinations are based on a comparison of the volumes of wastesrequiring treatment to the amount of treatment capacity available for suchtreatment (see Section III.B.1. and III.B.3.). Although EPA does not requirethat BDAT technologies be used to meet the applicable treatment standards,capacity is determined based on technologies identified as BDAT. The Agency is proposing to grant a two-year national variance for soiland debris contaminated with wastes for which BDAT is incineration (seeparagraph B. of this section) and for the following wastes that are disposedby means of underground injection: 1. Wastes Subject to a National Capacity Variance Until August 8, 1990(or until capacity becomes available, whichever is earliest): F007, K011,K013, K014. 2. Wastes Subject to a National Capacity Variance Until June 8, 1991 (oruntil capacity becomes available, whichever is earliest): K009, K010. E. Applicability of Today's Proposed Rule to Class I-H Hazardous WasteInjection Wells Regulated Under 40 CFR 148 The Agency has previously proposed and promulgated regulations and effectivedates for underground injected hazardous wastes covered under RCRA sections3004 (f) and (g) separately from regulations addressing wastes disposedin surface facilities. EPA is today addressing all methods of land disposalof wastes in today's proposal, including injection wells regulated jointlyunder the Safe Drinking Water Act and RCRA. F. Treatment Standards for Prohibited Wastes that are Mixed with Non-ProhibitedWastes One matter that has come to the Agency's attention concerns the statusof prohibited wastes that are mixed with other wastes that are not prohibited,for example, nonhazardous wastes, or hazardous wastes that are not yetprohibited such as wastes in the third third of the Schedule or newly identifiedor listed wastes. The rules are clear that the prohibited wastes must stillmeet all applicable treatment standards. That is, prohibited wastes arenot exempted from the land disposal prohibitions when they are mixed withother wastes (or any other materials, for that matter). Were this not thecase, land disposal prohibitions would be without meaning since they couldbe evaded by the simple expedient of mixing with a non-prohibited waste.Prohibited wastes are sometimes mixed with other materials in the courseof treatment. If the prohibited waste is no longer capable of being treatedto meet the treatment standard after mixing, it is possible that an improperform of treatment is occurring, i.e., one that makes the prohibited wastemore difficult to treat. Certainly, intentional mixing that is intendedto evade a treatment standard is impermissible. (See 52 FR 25766, July8, 1987, ``[a]rtificial aggregation points designed to avoid a prohibitioncertainly would not be considered legitimate * * *'') EPA realizes andacknowledges, however, that mixing wastes can be a normal part of treatment.<T3>Id.</T3> Therefore, to the extent that such mixing occurs and can bedetermined to be a legitimate part of the treatment process, the mixturecould be eligible for a treatability variance pursuant to andSection; 268.44.Part of the demonstration, however, would be whether mixing has made theprohibited waste more difficult to treat, and if so, whether the treatmentmethod utilized is still legitimate. (See response to comments number 10-U-1,page 411, RCRA LDR-9 docket, August 8, 1988.)<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Detailed Discussion of Today's Proposed Rule </ITAG>A. Determination of Treatability Groups and Development of Treatment StandardsSections III.A.1. through III.A.11. of today's preamble present discussionson the determination of treatability groups and the development of treatmentstandards for RCRA hazardous wastes, including those identified as SecondThird wastes. Sections III.A.1. through III.A.7. present an overview ofthe general procedures that the Agency follows for these determinations.The Agency is not reopening the issues presented in sections III.A.1. throughIII.A.7. for public comment, but is merely restating the Agency's positionson these issues. In Section III.A.8. of today's preamble, the Agency is proposing treatmentstandards for many of the Second Third wastes, some of the First Thirdwastes (that have not been previously proposed), and several Third Thirdwastes. In addition, this section includes a discussion of the status ofthe development of standards for all Second Third wastes. Sections III.A.9.through III.A.11. present various approaches for developing treatment standardsfor all of the remaining wastes. The Agency is requesting comments anddata that may be used in the development of the treatment standards forall wastes identified in sections III.A.8. through III.A.11. of this preamble.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Waste Treatability Groups </ITAG>The Agency uses the individual listed waste codes as the starting pointfor developing waste treatability groups for all RCRA hazardous wastes.Where wastes represented by different codes appear to be able to be treatedto similar concentrations using identical technologies the Agency combinesthe codes into one treatability group. Initial treatability group decisionsare based primarily on whether the wastes are generated by similar industriesor from similar processes. The Agency believes that such groupings canbe based on limited data because of the high likelihood that the wastecharacteristics that affect treatment performance will be similar for thesedifferent wastes. The treatment standards in today's proposed rule generally contain constituentconcentrations for ``wastewaters'' and constituent concentrations for ``nonwastewaters''.The treatment standards apply to the prohibited waste as well as to allresiduals generated by treating the original prohibited waste. Therefore,all solids generated from treatment of a particular waste must meet theapplicable nonwastewater treatment standards and all wastewaters generatedfrom treatment of this waste must meet the wastewater treatment standards.For purposes of this proposed rule, the Agency defines wastewaters as thosewastes (listed wastes, wastes generated as a result of the mixture rule,or wastes generated as a result of the derived-from rule) that containless than 1% total organic carbon (TOC) and less than 1% total suspendedsolids, except for those wastes identified as F001, F002, F003, F004, andF005. (See 51 FR 40579 for the definition of a solvent-water mixture).Those wastes, ``mixture'' wastes, or ``derived-from'' wastes, that do notmeet these criteria are defined as nonwastewaters. It is not permissibleto dilute or perform partial treatment on a waste in order to switch theapplicability of a nonwastewater standard to a wastewater standard (orvice versa). <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Identification of BDAT </ITAG>A detailed discussion of the methodology for identification of BDAT isprovided in the November 7, 1986 final rule (51 FR 40572). As the firststep in the development of BDAT treatment standards, EPA screens the availabletreatment data for a particular treatability group with regard to the designand operation of the system, the quality assurance/quality control analysesof the data, and the analytical tests used to assess treatment performance.This screening recognizes the fact that the analytical test that best measurestreatment performance depends on the treatment technology used (e.g., atotal constituent analysis best measures the destruction of organics byincineration, the TCLP analysis best measures the immobilization of metalconstituents by stabilization). EPA is able to emphasize the design andoperation of the particular treatment systems because its field tests havebeen designed to gather detailed data to support these analyses. In the next step, EPA adjusts all treated data values based on the analyticalrecovery, in order to take into account analytical interferences associatedwith the chemical makeup of the treated sample. For example, a treatedresidual data point of 0.2 mg/kg with an analytical recovery of 50 percentwould be adjusted to 0.4 mg/kg. After adjusting the data, EPA averagesthe performance values for the various treatment operations. The mean valuesare then compared, using the analysis of variance test (ANOVA) describedin the November 7, 1986 final rule (51 FR 40591), to determine if one technologyperformed significantly better than the other. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Compliance with Performance Standards </ITAG>All of the treatment standards in today's proposed rule reflect performanceachieved by the Best Demonstrated Available Technology (BDAT). As such,compliance with these standards only requires that the treatment levelbe achieved prior to land disposal. It generally does not require the useof any particular treatment technology. Today's proposal contains an exceptionto this general principle, based on difficulties with analysis of the treatmentresidue (see the discussion of K027 and related wastes below). While dilutionof the waste as a means to comply with the standard is prohibited, wastesthat are generated in such a way as to naturally meet the standard canbe land disposed without treatment. With the exception of treatment standardsthat prohibit land disposal and treatment standards for K027 and relatedwastes, all treatment standards proposed today are expressed as concentrationlevels. It is important to note that EPA's position on compliance with concentration-basedperformance standards and the identification of a technology as BDAT hassometimes been misinterpreted. The Agency emphasizes that the technologiesidentified as BDAT are simply those technologies which EPA utilized todevelop the waste specific concentration-based performance standards. Anyapplicable treatment or recycling technology (or combination of technologies),unless prohibited (such as dilution), can be used to achieve these standardsunless that technology is considered land disposal (such as land treatment).For all organic constituents and total cyanides, treatment standards arebased on the total constituent concentration found in the treated waste.Since these technologies are designed to destroy the hazardous organicconstituents (and cyanides), the Agency maintains that the best measureof treatment performance is the one that reflects the extent to which thevarious organic compounds (and cyanides) have been destroyed. [<T4>Note: </T4>The land disposal restrictions for solvent waste codes F001-F005(51 FR 40572) requires use of the TCLP value as a measure of performance.At the time that the treatment standards for F001-F005 were promulgated,useful data were not available on total constituent concentrations in treatedresiduals and, as a result, the TCLP was considered to be the best availablemeasure of performance.] In cases where treatment standards for metals are based on stabilization,the use of the TCLP is required as the measure of the performance of thetreatment technology because the Agency maintains that the TCLP best reflectsthe extent to which the mobility of most metals can be chemically or physicallyminimized. Where treatment standards are based on multiple treatment processesdue to the presence of organics and metals, the waste has to meet bothtotal constituent concentrations for organics and TCLP concentrations formetals prior to land disposal.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Applicability of Treatment Standards to Treatment Residues Identifiedas ``Derived-From'' Wastes </ITAG>In a number of instances in today's proposed rule, BDAT consists of anoperation or series of treatment operations that generate additional wasteresidues. For example, BDAT for K011 is based on incineration followedby stabilization. Incineration generates two residues that may requirefurther treatment, namely the ash residues and the scrubber waters. Treatmentof the scrubber waters to remove metals may generate additional inorganicresidues which may also require stabilization. Ultimately these additionalwastes may be land disposed, so they must meet the same standards as thestabilized ash residues. With respect to these additional wastes, the Agencywishes to emphasize that all of the residues from treating the originallisted wastes are likewise considered to be the listed waste by virtueof the derived-from rule contained in 40 CFR 261.3(c)(2). Consequently,all wastes generated in the course of treatment are prohibited from landdisposal unless they satisfy the treatment standard or are otherwise exemptedfrom the prohibition through a no-migration petition or by a capacity variance.Tests have not been performed in all cases on wastes that can result fromevery part of the treatment train. However, the treatment standards arebased on treatment of the most concentrated form of the waste, consequently,the Agency believes that the less concentrated wastes generated in thecourse of treatment can be treated to meet these standards. In the First Third Final Rule (53 FR 31146-31150, August 17, 1988), theAgency presented its rationale for maintaining that landfill leachate isderived from the wastes disposed in the landfill and that leachate mustmeet the appropriate wastewater treatment standards for all regulated constituentsprior to land disposal. Subsequent to promulgation of the First Third Final Rule, the Circuit Courtof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stayed the applicabilityof the First Third rule to leachate residues from treating such leachateand groundwater contaminated with leachate. (Order of August 18, 1988.)The Court clarified that other prohibited wastes that are mixed with leachatemust still meet treatment standards ``to the extent possible''. (Orderof September 23, 1988) In today's rule, EPA solicits further comment on the issue of treatabilityof multi-source leachate. The Agency specifically solicits further dataon interfering agents in multi-source leachate, including data on whethermetals and organics may impede sequential treatment. The Agency also solicitsdata on multi-source leachate treatment capacity, although it notes thatit has set in motion a means of alleviating practical problems due to draftingof permits in terms of specific waste codes. 53 FR 46474 (November 17,1988). Pending further study, therefore, the Second Third rule treatment standardsand effective dates would also apply to leachate derived from these wastes.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Transfer of Treatment Standards </ITAG>In today's proposed rule, some treatment standards are not based on testingthe performance of BDAT on the specific waste subject to the treatmentstandard. Instead, the Agency determined that the constituents presentin the waste can be treated to the same performance levels as observedin other wastes on which testing was performed. EPA believes that transferringtreatment performance data to establish treatment standards for untestedwastes or constituents is technically valid when the untested wastes aregenerated from similar industries and/or similar processing steps or whenthe constituents have similar chemical and physical properties. Transferof treatment standards to wastes from similar processing steps requireslittle formal analysis because of the likelihood that similar productionprocesses will produce a waste matrix with similar characteristics. In cases where only the industry is similar, EPA closely examines the wastecharacteristics prior to concluding that the untested waste constituentscan be treated to levels associated with tested wastes through a two-stepanalysis. First, EPA reviews the available waste characteristic data toidentify those parameters which are expected to affect treatment selection.EPA has identified some of the most important constituents (and other parameters)to select the treatment technology appropriate for a given waste. Whenan individual analysis suggests that an untested waste can be treated withthe same technology as a waste for which treatment performance data arealready available, a more detailed list of constituents is analyzed thatrepresent some of the most important waste characteristics which the Agencybelieves will affect the performance of the technology. By examining andcomparing these characteristics, the Agency determines whether the untestedwastes will achieve the same level of treatment as the tested waste. Wherethe Agency determines that the untested waste can be treated as well asthe tested waste, the treatment standards can be transferred. A detaileddiscussion of this transfer process can be found in the BDAT backgrounddocuments for each waste or waste treatability group. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. No Land Disposal as the BDAT Treatment Standard </ITAG>EPA is proposing a treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal'' for severalwastes. This standard is analogous to the no discharge standard establishedas Best Available Technology (BAT) under the Clean Water Act's effluentguideline program. A ``No Land Disposal'' standard usually indicates thatafter examining available data, the Agency has identified that: (1) Thewaste can be totally recycled without generating a prohibited residue;(2) the waste is not currently being land disposed; or (3) the waste isno longer being generated and is not anticipated to be generated duringa RCRA or CERCLA corrective action. For any wastes having a proposed treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal'',EPA solicits comments on the potential for disposal of that particularwaste. EPA is especially concerned with such standards because, once promulgated,these standards make it illegal to land dispose these wastes. Should itbe revealed after promulgation of the ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation''treatment standard that these wastes are being generated and land disposed,the generator may apply for a variance from the treatment standard. Thevariance petition should clearly indicate that the waste is being generatedcontrary to EPA's original assessment, and should present treatment datato be used to establish a new treatment standard (40 CFR 268.44). However,during the period the variance is being processed, the waste may not beland disposed, notwithstanding the inaccuracy of the original assessmentthat the waste was not being generated. Should commenters provide informationthat one or more of the premises used to determine the ``No Land Disposal''standard are not valid, the treatment standard may not be finalized andland disposal of the waste is usually subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions.Prior to May 8, 1990, EPA intends to develop and propose treatment standardsfor these wastes. If no specific comments are received refuting the validityof the basis for the ``No Land Disposal'' standard, EPA generally proceedswith the promulgation of the standard as proposed.The ``No Land Disposal'' standard does not imply that the waste is so extremelyhazardous that it can not be safely land disposed or handled; rather, itmeans that there is no need to land dispose the waste because alternativeforms of management exist. Today's notice does not propose the treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal''for any wastewaters. The basis of this standard, as previously proposedfor other wastes, was that since no nonwastewater forms of certain listedwastes were being generated, no wastewater forms were being generated.However, the Agency now has information indicating that wastewater formsof many of the listed wastes are or can be generated as leachates fromprevious land disposal. Other wastewater forms of listed wastes that maybe generated include those wastewaters being generated at CERCLA sites,during RCRA corrective actions, and as residuals from treatment processessuch as dewatering. Since generation of wastewaters is anticipated to occur,the premise of no generation as a basis for the treatment standard of ``NoLand Disposal'' is invalid. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Additional Considerations in Setting Treatment Standards </ITAG>The Agency has decided to reiterate its response to certain comments receivedduring the comment period for the First Third proposed rule regarding treatmentstandard development. This discussion is included in today's proposed rulesolely for the sake of clarification. EPA is not reopening the commentperiod on these issues. a. <T3>Use of Extraction Procedure (EP) Toxicity Data. </T3>The Agency believesthat the results from use of the TCLP do not compare with EP results forall metals in all wastes, even though in some special instances, specificmetals within specific waste matrices have been shown to yield statisticallysimilar results using the TCLP and the EP. However, until a statisticalrelationship for specific constituents in treated wastes can be demonstrated,the Agency is reluctant to use data generated from the EP when calculatingtreatment standards. Data to correlate EP and TCLP tests for certain stabilized wastes weresubmitted to the Agency. The preliminary analysis shows a correlation forsome constituents in these specific stabilized wastes. Additional datasubmitted prior to the final rulemaking will be considered by the Agencyin the development of the treatment standards provided they do not lackimportant information that is necessary for evaluation of the performanceof the process. The data must represent a well operated treatment system.Typically data on stabilization technologies lack information on the typeof binding agents used, the ratios of binder to waste, the leachabilityof the untreated waste, the setting and curing conditions, and the wastecharacteristics that are anticipated to affect performance of the technology.In addition, data generally lack specific paired analysis which would allowcomparison of untreated samples with specific treated samples. This informationis necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and to assessthe contribution of dilution by the reagents. All performance data used (and not used) in calculating the proposed andfinal treatment standards will be placed in the administrative record forthis rule. Relevant design and operating data claimed as Confidential BusinessInformation will be treated as such by the Agency in the administrativerecord and cannot be disclosed to the public. All data that are not usedfor final rule development will be documented and justified in the backgrounddocument and in the administrative record for each specific treatabilitygroup. b. <T3>Treatment Standards Based on Single Facility Data. </T3>The Agencybelieves that the use of a small number of data sets from a single treatmentfacility can be representative of the treatment achieved by the particulartreatment system. It is impossible for the Agency to sample every facilitygenerating a particular waste or every treatment system treating the waste,thus the Agency established a procedure and methodology for selecting particularfacilities and treatment systems that are considered well designed andoperated for the determination of BDAT treatment standards (53 FR 31138).The Agency recognizes that there are certain variabilities inherent toevery treatment system as well as variability in the wastes. In the calculationof the treatment standards, the Agency accounts for these by multiplyingthe mean of the treated data by a variability factor. This factor is derivedutilizing a quantitative procedure that determines the statistical 99thpercentile for the treatment standard. This results in the establishmentof a treatment standard that is believed to be achievable 99 percent ofthe time by a well designed, well operated system. c. <T3>Demonstrated and Available Technologies. </T3>EPA considers demonstratedtechnologies to be those that are used to treat the waste or constituentof interest (or those similar to the waste or constituent of interest)with regard to parameters that affect treatment selection. For example,EPA may consider basing a treatment standard on the performance of incinerationif incineration is being used to treat that waste or constituent that issimilar to it in terms of functional groups, boiling point, heat of combustion,and other physical/chemical characteristics that may affect the treatmentperformance. EPA also considers those physical technologies that are usedto separate or otherwise process chemicals and other materials (i.e., filtration,dewatering, centrifugation, solvent extraction, etc). Some of these technologiesclearly are applicable to waste treatment, since the wastes are similarto raw materials processed in industrial applications. To decide whether demonstrated technologies may be considered ``available,''the Agency determines whether they (1) Are commercially available and (2)substantially diminish the toxicity of the waste or substantially reducethe likelihood of migration of hazardous constituents from the waste. EPAwill only set treatment standards based on a technology that meets theabove criteria. The determination of ``available'' is not dependent onsufficient treatment capacity, that is, determination of BDAT is not limitedto only those treatment technologies which have sufficient treatment capacity.d. <T3>Selection of BDAT Constituents. </T3>The Agency considered all BDATlist constituents present in the waste when establishing treatment standards.The rationale for selection of the regulated constituents can be foundin the Background Document for each waste or waste treatability group.The Agency believes that it is not restricted to regulating only thoseconstituents for which a waste is listed. Constituents that are not specificallylisted on Appendix VIII can often be used as indicators of either the presenceof other Appendix VIII constituents that have no analytical method or canbe used as an indication of the effectiveness of a given technology. However,the Agency may choose not to regulate indicator constituents when performancestandards can be established for other hazardous or nonhazardous constituentswhich will ensure that the constituent of concern will be effectively treated.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Treatment Investigations for all Second Third Wastes and Presentationof All Proposed Treatment Standards </ITAG>This section of today's preamble presents a discussion of the status oftreatment investigations for all Second Third wastes. Included in thissection are all treatment standards that are being proposed in today'srule. This includes many of the Second Third wastes, some of the FirstThird wastes that are currently regulated under the ``soft hammer'' provisions,and some Third Third wastes that the Agency has decided to propose aheadof schedule. In this section and in section III.A.9. of today's rule, thelisting description for each waste is provided for the convenience of thereader. This description is not intended to be a redefinition of any particularwaste code description, nor is the Agency reopening the description forpublic comment. In a similar manner, the Agency has provided in parenthesis,the appropriate scheduling group (i.e., 1st, 2nd or 3rd Third) with eachwaste description. For those Second Third wastes that the Agency is not proposing treatmentstandards in today's rule, the Agency presents the approach and optionsthat the Agency is considering for establishing BDAT treatment standards.This discussion is intended to give advance notice to the regulated communityand to provide an opportunity to comment on these approaches and to submitdata that may help in developing such standards. The Agency is specifically soliciting comments on the proposed treatmentstandards and the approach to developing treatment standards for each ofthe individual wastes or treatability groups. Comments and data on specifictreatment technologies for specific wastes or subcategories should includea description of the generation process or processes, complete chemicaland physical analyses of the wastes and treatment residuals (includingall appropriate QA/QC information), as well as technical descriptions ofthe treatment technologies including design and operating conditions. a. <T3>Cyanide Wastes.</T3> Today, the Agency is proposing treatment standardsfor the majority of wastes containing cyanide. These wastes include severalF and K wastes specifically generated by facilities in the metal finishingindustry and by facilities engaged in the production of acrylonitrile.The Agency has identified two general treatability groups for the cyanidewastes, metal finishing wastes and wastes generated from the productionof acrylonitrile. The treatment standards for cyanides and organic constituentsin the wastes are based on testing performed by the Agency and industrysubmitted data using destruction technologies such as electrolytic oxidation,wet air oxidation, alkaline chlorination, and incineration. The treatmentstandards for metals are based on technologies such as precipitation, filtration,and stabilization. In addition, the Agency is proposing to transfer theseperformance data to other U and P waste containing cyanides. Also, theAgency is proposing a methodology to a develop treatment standards forthe subcategory of D003 reactive waste identified as the reactive cyanidesubcategory.1. <T3>Wastes from the Metal Finishing Industry.</T3><ITAG tagnum="16">F006_Wastewater treatment sludges from electroplating operations exceptfrom the following processes: (1) Sulfuric acid anodizing of aluminum;(2) tin plating on carbon steel; (3) zinc plating (segregated basis) oncarbon steel; (4) aluminum or zinc-aluminum plating on carbon steel; (5)cleaning/stripping associated with tin, zinc and aluminum plating on carbonsteel; and (6) chemical etching and milling of aluminum.

(2nd) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">F019_Wastewater treatment sludges from the chemical conversion coatingof aluminum.  (1st)</ITAG>As stated in the introduction, the Agency has defined two general treatabilitygroups within the cyanide waste codes. One of these is comprised of cyanidewastes from the metal finishing industry. The wastes that are generatedfrom the metal finishing industry primarily include wastes from electroplatingand heat treating operations. The Agency believes that the wastes generatedfrom these processes are similar_based on the waste characteristics_andtherefore comprise one treatability group. Detailed technical descriptionof the specific electroplating and heat treating processes, generationand waste characteristics of these wastes, and discussion of the applicabletechnologies can be found in the Background Document for Cyanide Wastes.The Agency has developed three subcategories within the metal finishingtreatability group: Metal Finishing Aqueous Liquids, Metal Finishing OrganicLiquids, and Metal Finishing Sludges. Wastes in the Metal Finishing AqueousLiquids Subcategory are typically generated as wastewaters, thereby havinga total suspended solids and total organics concentration of less thanone percent. The waste codes associated with this subcategory are F007,F008, F009, and F011. Wastes in the Metal Finishing Organic Liquids Subcategoryare also generated as liquids, but exceed the 1% total organic contentand are therefore considered nonwastewaters. The only waste code associatedwith this subcategory is F010. Although the listing for F010 describesit as a sludge, it is typically generated as a pumpable sludge that isconsidered to be a liquid by EPA's ``paint filter test''. Due to the highorganic content in F010, the liquid physical characteristic of F010, andthe resultant choices of applicable treatment technologies, EPA has decidedto identify these F010 nonwastewaters as Metal Finishing Organic Liquids.Wastes in the Metal Finishing Sludges Subcategory are also generated asnonwastewaters, but have lower organic content. The treatment technologiesapplicable to these wastes are typically different from those applicableto F010 wastes. The waste codes associated with this subcategory are F006,F012, F019. Treatment residuals and other ``derived-from'' wastes frommanaging wastes in any of these three subcategories could be generatedas either wastewaters or nonwastewaters, thus EPA is proposing standardsfor both wastewaters and nonwastewaters in all three subcategories. i. <T3>Applicable Technologies for Wastes Generated from the Metal FinishingIndustry Treatability Group. </T3>Within the metal finishing industry treatabilitygroup, the Agency believes that any commercial technology that destroysthe organics and cyanide constituents in the waste is an applicable technology.The Agency has identified the following destruction technologies as applicableand demonstrated technologies for the organic and cyanide constituentsin the waste generated from the metal finishing industry treatability group:electrolytic oxidation, alkaline chlorination, wet air oxidation, ultravioletozonation, oxidation with sulfur dioxide and air or potassium permanganate,high temperature hydrolysis, and incineration. The Agency believes thatthese technologies destroy the amenable cyanide concentration by convertingthe amenable cyanide to constituents such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen,and ammonia. The Agency believes that the complex cyanide constituentswithin the waste are more difficult to treat by these conventional technologies.The Agency believes that ion exchange and ultraviolet ozonation are technologiesthat may treat the complex cyanides in the waste. The Agency is solicitingcomments and data on the use of these technologies or any other commercialtechnology that treat complex cyanide constituents in the waste. Also,the Agency has identified ion exchange as a potential recycling technologyfor the cyanide constituent within the wastes. Although the Agency doesnot believe that this technology has been demonstrated on a commercialbasis, the Agency is soliciting comments and data on the use of ion exchangeor any other technology for recycling cyanides. The Agency does not believe that stabilization is an applicable technologyfor the treatment of amenable or complex cyanide constituent in wastes.The legislative history to section 3004(m) indicates that Congress intendedthat the ``destruction of total cyanides would be required as a preconditionto land disposal'' (130 Congressional Record S9179, July 25, 1984, statementof Senator Chaffee).Stabilization processes only reduce the leachability of constituents withina waste but do not destroy the constituent. The Agency believes that stabilizationis geared toward stabilizing cationic species (such as some of the BDATmetals); therefore anionic species (such as cyanides) are not effectivelystabilized. For the metal constituents within the wastes, the Agency has identifiedas applicable technologies chemical precipitation followed by filtrationand stabilization. The Agency has examined treatment data for the three subcategories of themetal finishing industry. This treatment data was used to develop the BDATtreatment standards for amenable and total cyanide and BDAT metals. TheAgency believes that the treatment data used to develop the treatment standardsfor the three subcategories within the metal finishing industry were obtainedfrom well designed and well operated treatment systems. The Agency believesthat any of the other applicable technologies can achieve similar treatmentlevels as the BDAT technologies as long as the treatment systems are welldesigned and well operated. ii. <T3>Regulated Constituents and Treatment Standards for the Wastes Generatedfrom the Metal Finishing Industry Treatability Group.</T3> The proposedregulated constituents and BDAT treatment standards for the wastes generatedfrom the metal finishing industry treatability group are listed at theend of this table. The Agency believes that regulating these constituentswill ensure that other BDAT list constituents will be effectively treatedby the technologies determined to be BDAT. EPA's rationale for selectingthe regulated constituents is presented in the BDAT Background Documentfor the Cyanide Waste Codes. Facilities must comply with these treatmentstandards prior to placement of these wastes in land disposal units. Thosewastes that are generated naturally meet these standards are not prohibitedfrom disposal in these units. Dilution to achieve these treatment levelsis forbidden. The treatment standard for the cyanide constituent is based on a totalwaste analysis for amenable and total cyanide concentration for two reasons.First, the Agency believes that by only regulating the amenable cyanideconcentration, the complex-metal cyanides that are present in the wasteswould not be regulated. Second, based on the review of the available treatmentdata, the Agency believes that the conventional cyanide treatment technologiesdo provide substantial treatment of the amenable and total cyanide concentrationas measured by the Cyanide Amenable to Chlorination test in Method 9010(EPA Publication SW-846). However, the Agency believes that these complex-metalcyanides can be treated further by adding another treatment step, (i.e.ozonation and ion exchange) in order to further reduce the concentrationof the complex metal cyanides. The Agency is soliciting comments and treatmentdata for further reduction of the complex-metal cyanides. As stated before, the Agency is regulating cyanide in the total waste analysisfor amenable and total cyanide concentration. The Agency is proposing thetotal waste analysis for two reasons. One reason, as mentioned before,the Agency does not believe that stabilization is an applicable technologyfor wastes containing cyanides. The second reason is that the Agency isconcerned that by performing the TCLP test under acidic conditions, thereis a possibility of losing hydrogen cyanide gas which may produce loweredresults. Also, the TCLP test is generally done during acidic conditionswith zero headspace and EPA has concerns on the safety of this test asperformed in the laboratory. Under acidic conditions, cyanides are convertedto hydrogen cyanide, a highly toxic gas. While hydrogen cyanide is highlysoluble, there exists a significant possibility of release of this gasduring the TCLP extraction process. Uncontrolled releases in the laboratorycould pose a health problem for the laboratory personnel. While the Agencybelieves that these potential releases can be safely accounted for in thelaboratory with typical laboratory safety precautions and that the releasefrom a relatively small analytical sample would be minimal, the Agencyis concerned that the laboratory personnel may not be aware of the safetyprecautions that would be required during the extraction procedure. TheAgency is soliciting comments from industry on the use of TCLP test forthe testing of wastes containing significant levels of total cyanides.iii. <T3>Identification of BDAT and Regulated Constituents and Treatment Standardsfor the Metal Finishing Aqueous Liquids Subcategory (F007, F008, F009,and F011).</T3> For the Metal Finishing Aqueous Liquid Subcategory, theAgency tested the technologies of electrolytic oxidation followed by alkalinechlorination and wet air oxidation. Also, the Agency examined data submittedby industry on the treatment of these wastes by alkaline chlorination,high temperature hydrolysis, and oxidation processes with the oxidizingagents such as potassium permanganate or sulfur dioxide and air. The Agency is proposing BDAT treatment standards for amenable and totalcyanide and metal constituents for the wastewater and nonwastewater. Thewastewater treatment standard for the amenable and total cyanide constituentswithin the waste is based on BDAT as wet air oxidation. The wastewatertreatment standards for the dissolved metal constituents are based on BDATas chemical precipitation, filtration and sludge dewatering. For the nonwastewatertreatment standards, the total and amenable cyanide and the metals treatmentstandards are based on a transfer from the performance data for the MetalFinishing Sludges Subcategory. The Agency believes that the nonwastewatersthat are generated from treating these wastes have similar characteristicsto the Metal Finishing Sludges. Therefore, the nonwastewater cyanide treatmentstandard is based on BDAT as electrolytic oxidation followed by alkalinechlorination and the treatment standards for the metals are based on chemicalprecipitation followed by filtration and stabilization. The dissolved metalnonwastewater treatment standards are based on BDAT as stabilization. TheAgency must emphasize that the other applicable technologies for treatingorganics and cyanides can achieve the treatment standards as long as thetreatment technologies are well designed and well operated. iv. <T3>Identification of BDAT and Regulated Constituents and Treatment Standardsfor the Metal Finishing Organic Liquid Subcategory (F010).</T3> For theMetal Finishing Organic Liquids Subcategory, the only performance datathat was available to the Agency is the treatment of this waste by incineration.Due to the high level of organics in these wastes, conventional aqueouscyanide treatment was not performed on these F010 wastes. Concentrationsof cyanides were analyzed only in the ash residuals and not in the untreatedorganic liquid due to analytical difficulties. The Agency has determinedthat incineration is BDAT for the nonwastewater forms of these Metal FinishingOrganic Liquids wastes. The wastewater treatment standards for this subcategoryare based on the transfer of the performance of the wet air oxidation treatmentsystem that was the BDAT for cyanide wastes in the Aqueous Metal FinishingLiquids Subcategory.According to discussions with treaters and generators of F010 wastes, F010can often exist as a bilayered waste. The treaters often separate an organiclayer from an aqueous layer. This F010 organic layer is what is typicallyincinerated. According to BDAT definitions, the F010 aqueous layer is consideredto be a nonwastewater because the total organic content typically exceeds1%. Treaters indicate that they can often treat this F010 by conventionalcyanide treatment rather than by incineration. At this time, the Agencyhas not examined the efficiency of this separation process, but has insteadproposed standards for all F010 wastes based on the incineration of theorganic layer. The Agency believes that although the aqueous layer is typicallygenerated as a nonwastewater, the separation process can be operated atan efficiency such that the aqueous layer can be generated as a wastewaterrather than a nonwastewater. Thus, the wastewater treatment standard wouldapply rather than the nonwastewater standard. The Agency also believesthat the generator is not precluded from separating these layers into thetwo different treatability groups. For the nonwastewater treatment standards for this subcategory, the Agencyis only proposing treatment standards for the total cyanide concentrationwithin the waste due to the performance of incineration. The Agency believesthat incineration can destroy the cyanide concentration to the nondetectablelevels. v. <T3>Identification of BDAT and Regulated Constituents and Treatment Standardsfor the Metal Finishing Sludge Subcategory (F006, F012, F019). </T3>MetalFinishing Sludges are considered nonwastewaters and are generated froma chemical precipitation treatment, which usually follows a cyanide oxidationtreatment. The Agency has tested the treatment train of electrolytic oxidationfollowed by alkaline chlorination for the cyanide constituent in the wasteand has tested the treatment train of chemical precipitation followed byfiltration and stabilization for the metals within the solid residues.Based on the analysis of the data, the Agency has determined that BDATfor the pretreatment of cyanides in the Metal Finishing Sludges is electrolyticoxidation followed by alkaline chlorination, precipitation with lime andfiltration. The Agency has determined that BDAT for the metals within thetreatment sludges is stabilization. The wastewaters and nonwastewaters treatment standards for the cyanideconstituent in the Metal Finishing Sludge Subcategory are based on theperformance of the treatment system of electrolytic oxidation followedby alkaline chlorination. The Metal Finishing Sludges nonwastewaters standardsfor the metal constituents are based on the performance of lime precipitationfollowed by filtration and stabilization. These standards are transferredfrom F006 to F012 and F019 nonwastewaters standards. In the Land DisposalRestrictions for the First Third Schedule Wastes Final Rule (53 FR 31138),the Agency reserved the BDAT treatment standards for cyanide in the F006nonwastewaters. The Agency stated in this rule that the F006 treatmentsludges may contain treatable levels of cyanide. As noted above, the Agencydoes not consider stabilization, which is BDAT for the metals in the F006nonwastewaters, to be a demonstrated technology for the cyanides. The Agencybelieves that a pretreatment step, that incorporates a technology thatdestroys the cyanides, should be done before the stabilization of the metals.Therefore, the Agency is transferring the proposed BDAT treatment standardsfor cyanides in F006 nonwastewaters from the proposed treatment standardsfor F012 nonwastewaters. This BDAT cyanide treatment standard is basedon total waste analysis for amenable and total cyanide concentrations.The Agency is not revising the metal standards for F006 nonwastewatersand is not reopening for comments the promulgated metals standards forF006 nonwastewaters.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards Metal Finishing Liquids Subcategory for </T4>F007,F008, F009, <T4>and </T4>F011 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>110 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>0.064 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.066 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>(\1\) </D><D>5.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.51 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.32 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.072 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,8.2,10 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards Metal Finishing Liquid Subcategory for </T4>F007,F008, F009, <T4>and </T4>F011 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>12 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>1.3 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>0.32 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.04 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>0.44 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,10,10 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards Organic Metal Finishing Liquid Subcategory</T4>F010 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>1.5 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,9.1,10 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards Organic Metal Finishing Liquids Subcategory</T4>F010 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>12 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>1.3 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,10 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards Metal Finishing Sludges Subcategory for </T4>F006<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>110 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>0.064 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,9.1,10 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards Metal Finishing Sludges Subcategory for </T4>F006<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>12 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>1.3 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards Metal Finishing Sludges Subcategory for </T4>F012<T4>and </T4>F019 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>110 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>0.064 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.066 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>(\1\) </D><D>5.2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>(\1\)</D><D>0.51 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.32 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.072 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,8.2,10 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards Metal Finishing Sludges Subcategory for </T4>F012<T4>and </T4>F019 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>12 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>1.3 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium <D>0.32 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead <D>0.04 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel <D>0.44 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG>2. <T3>Wastes from Acrylonitrile Production.</T3><ITAG tagnum="16">K011_Bottom stream from the wastewater stripper in the productionof acrylonitrile.

(1st)</ITAG>Another treatability group within the cyanide group is the waste generatedfrom acrylonitrile production. The listed waste K011, K013, and K014 arewithin this treatability group. These wastes are considered to be organicnitrile wastes and are hazardous not only for the organic constituentsbut also for cyanide. The Agency believes that these wastes are classifiedin one treatability group because they are generated from the same industrialprocess and are not typically segregated when managed as hazardous waste.The Agency estimates that there are 6 facilities that may generate thesewastes. Detailed technical description of the acrylonitrile process andwaste characterization of these wastes can be found in the BDAT BackgroundDocument for these wastes. Acrylonitrile is produced by the Standard Oil ammoxidation process throughthe exothermic reaction of propylene, ammonia, and air in a fluidized-bedcatalytic reactor at approximately 750-950 anddegrees;F and 5 to 30 psig.The reaction product is quenched with water generating an absorber wastewatereffluent and an acrylonitrile and acetonitrile product stream. These streamsare separated and purified, generating product streams, heavy ends (K013,K014) and crude hydrogen cyanide. The acrylonitrile bottoms are usuallycombined with the aqueous effluent from the quench/absorption section andthen steam stripped. The resulting aqueous effluent (K011) is combinedwith the acetonitrile purification bottoms and typically disposed via undergroundby injection. Each of the acrylonitrile wastes contain organics such as acetonitrile,acrylonitrile, acrylamide, benzene, ethyl cyanide and pyridine. These wastescontain about 5000 ppm of cyanide and nickel. The Agency recognizes any technology that destroys the organics and cyanideconstituents in the waste is an applicable technology for this treatabilitygroup. The Agency has identified the following technologies as applicabletechnologies for this treatability group: incineration, critical fluids,wet air oxidation, and wet air oxidation followed by biological treatment.The Agency has also identified precipitation, filtration, and stabilizationas applicable technologies for the metal constituents in the waste residues.i. <T3>Determination of BDAT for the nonwastewaters.</T3> The Agency believesthat each of the applicable technologies generate a nonwastewater residue.Incinerators generate an ash residue that, for the purpose of BDAT, areclassified as nonwastewaters. The critical fluids technology generatesa wastewater phase that may need further treatment which may generate asolid residue. Both wet air oxidation and wet air oxidation followed bybiological treatment generate a solid residue. The Agency has tested rotary kiln incineration and has examined industrysubmitted data using the treatment system of wet air oxidation and criticalfluids for this treatability group. The Agency believes that both incinerationand wet air oxidation are demonstrated technologies for the K011, K013,and K014 nonwastewaters treatability group. The Agency believes that thedata submitted on the critical fluids treatment system is not a demonstratedprocess for this treatability group because the treatment data was fora bench scale operation. Therefore, the Agency believes that the demonstratedand available technologies for treating these wastes are incineration andwet air oxidation. The Agency tested rotary kiln incineration at one facility that was generatingin combination K011, K013, and K014 wastes. This waste was collected fromthe bottom of a surface impoundment. The Agency has also determined thatthe treatment train of rotary kiln incineration followed by stabilizationas BDAT for the nonwastewaters residuals achieves a level of performancethat represents treatment by BDAT. ii. <T3>Determination of BDAT for the wastewaters.</T3> As stated before, eachof the applicable technologies also generate a wastewater residue. Theuntreated waste that was tested by the Agency contained low level of organicsand therefore the hazardous constituents were not detected in the scrubberwaters. The Agency did not believe that a technical transfer of the scrubberwater data generated from this test would be an appropriate transfer. TheAgency performed pilot scale tests for the treatment of the K011, K013,K014 wastewaters. The performance of the wet air oxidation system The Agencydetermined that the wastewaters standards for this treatability group couldbe transferred from the performance of wet air oxidation followed by biologicaltreatment that was developed by the Office of Water in the Effluent GuidelinesDevelopment Document for Effluent Limitations and Standards for the OrganicChemicals Plastics and Synthetic Fibers Point Source Category (40 CFR Part414).The Agency has developed treatment standards for the wastewaters basedon the performance of the treatment train of wet air oxidation followedby biological treatment for the wastewater. EPA has determined that thetreatment train consisting of wet air oxidation followed by biologicaltreatment is BDAT for the wastewaters for K011, K013, K014.iii. <T3>Regulated Constituents. </T3>The proposed regulated constituents andBDAT treatment standards for the waste identified as K011, K013, K014 arelisted in the table at the end of this section. The Agency believes thatregulating these constituents will ensure that other BDAT List constituentswill be effectively treated by the technologies determined to be BDAT.Treatment standards for all of the organic constituents and cyanides arebased on the analyses of total constituent concentration. Treatment standardsfor metal constituents are based on the TCLP analyses for all the wasteidentified as nonwastewaters.The Agency is proposing a total cyanide treatment standard for the nonwastewaters.The Agency believes the performance of the treatment system can destroythe cyanide constituent to the nondetectable levels. For the metal constituentspresent in the ash, the Agency believes that stabilization is an applicabletechnology. Recently, the Agency received performance data for the stabilizationof the metals within the incinerator ash. The Agency has not had an opportunityto review the data for the purpose of this proposal. Preliminary resultsindicate that for the three stabilization binders that were tested, theperformance data showed that the treatment system was not effective. TheAgency believes that stabilization is an applicable technology for themetal within the waste and solicits comments and data from industry onthe use of this treatment technology for the metals within the waste.The Agency is aware that the generators of these waste are disposing ofthe aqueous waste streams from the production by underground injectionunits. These aqueous waste stream are considered to be K011, K013, K014due to the ``derived from'' rule. Before being disposed in a deep wellinjection unit, these waste must meet the BDAT treatment standards forthe wastewaters or be disposed in a no migration unit. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,8.2,8</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K011, K013, and K014 </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg)</H2><H2>TCLP(mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Acetonitrile<D>1.8</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Acrylonitrile<D>1.4</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Acrylamidee<D>23</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene<D>0.03</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total)<D>57</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel<D>(\1\)</D><D>0.32</D><F>\1\ Not applicable. </F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s20,8.2,8</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K011, K013, and K014</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Acetonitrile<D>0.14</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Acrylonitrile<D>0.14</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Acrylamide<D>0.14</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzene<D>0.14</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total)<D>12</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable)<D>1.3</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel<D>0.44</D><D>(\1\)</D><F>\1\Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG>3. <T3>Cyanide Wastes Designated as Either U or P Wastes.</T3><ITAG tagnum="16">P013_Barium cyanide  (3rd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P021_Calcium cyanide  (3rd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P029_Copper cyanide  (2nd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P030_Soluble cyanides salts (NOS)  (1st)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P063_Hydrogen cyanide  (1st)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P074_Nickel cyanide  (2nd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P098_Potassium cyanide  (2nd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P099_Potassium silver cyanide  (3rd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P104_Silver cyanide  (2nd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P106_Sodium cyanide  (2nd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">P121_Zinc cyanide  (3rd)</ITAG>Today, the Agency is proposing numerical treatment standards for the Uand P waste codes listed above. These waste codes are typically generatedfrom the metal finishing subcategory. These numerical standards are directlytransferred from the proposed BDAT treatment standards for the cyanideF waste codes generated from the electroplating and heat treating operations.The Agency is proposing these numerical treatment standards in this sectiondue to the similarity of the U and P waste codes to these cyanide F wastecodes. The Agency has determined that the constituents present in the U and Pwaste codes can be treated to the same performance levels as observed inthe other waste for which EPA has developed treatment standards. EPA believesthat transferring treatment performance for use in establishing treatmentstandards for untested wastes is valid technically in cases where the untestedwaste are generated from similar industries and similar processes.These U and P cyanide compounds dissociate in aqueous conditions to forma soluble cyanide (CN^) species and a soluble metallic (or alkalie earth)species. In particular, wastes identified as P030 are listed as ``solublecyanides salts, not otherwise specified (NOS)''. Of all of the U and Pcyanide waste codes, P030 is the most frequently used code. The Agencybelieves that the listing of these chemicals as ``soluble'' infers thatthey will dissociate in aqueous conditions to the cyanide ion. All of theseU and P chemicals are typically used as components in either electroplatingor heat treating baths.Treatment standards for total cyanides and amenable cyanides are proposedfor both nonwastewater and wastewater forms of all cyanide U and P wastecodes. All of the proposed cyanide standards are directly transferred fromthe standards proposed for the Metal Finishing Aqueous Liquids treatabilitygroup (previously described in section III. A. 8. a. 1. of today's rule).The proposed treatment standards for the metals constituents within theparticular U and P waste are also transferred from this treatability group.The Agency believes that the P wastes listed above have similar waste characteristicsas the Metal Finishing Aqueous Liquids subcategory.Treatment standards have been proposed for copper in wastes identifiedas P029 and for zinc standards in wastes identified as P121. In the finalrule for the First Third wastes, the Agency did not promulgate standardsthat were proposed for these two constituents in other wastes. This wasprimarily because other metals were being regulated for those wastes. TheAgency believes that by regulating the other metals, copper and zinc wouldbe controlled. However, for P029 and P121, there are no other metals thatthe Agency has identified as necessarily present in P029 or P121 wastes.Therefore the Agency believes that these metal constituents should be regulatedfor these waste codes.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,6.3,6.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for P013, P021, P029, P030, P063, P074, P098,P099, P104, P106, and P121 </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>110 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>0.064</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper (P029 only) <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.71 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel (P074 only) <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver (P099 and P104 only) <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.07 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zinc (P121 only) <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.086 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s20,8.2,r10 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for P013, P021, P029, P030, P063, P074, P098,P099, P104, P106, and P121 </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (total) <D>12. </D><D>(\2\)  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanides (amenable) <D>1.3</D><D>(\2\)  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Copper (P029 only) <D>0.42</D><D>(\2\)  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel (P074 only) <D>0.44</D><D>(\2\)  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver (P099 and P104 only) <D>(\1\) </D><D>(\2\)  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zinc (P121 only) <D>(\1\) </D><D>(\2\)  </D><F>\1\ Reserved.</F><F>\2\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG>4. <T3>Cyanide Wastes Designated as D003 Reactive.</T3> Today, the Agencyis not proposing BDAT treatment standards for the D003 waste code. However,the Agency is proposing a strategy for the development of the BDAT treatmentstandards for the cyanide waste designated as D003. The Agency is proposinga subcategory for D003 waste code identified as the D003 Reactive CyanidesSubcategory. [See section III.A.10.c.] According to 40 CFR Section 261.23(a)(5),a waste can be identified as a D003 waste when it is a cyanide or sulfidebearing waste which, when exposed to pH conditions between 2 and 12.5,can generate toxic gases, vapors or fumes in quantity sufficient to presenta danger to human health or the environment.The Agency is considering the proposal of treatment standards for nonwastewaterand wastewater forms of D003 Reactive Cyanides based on the direct transferof the total cyanides and amenable cyanides treatment standards of F007,F008, F009 and F011. Information available to the Agency indicates thatapproximately 90% of the D003 wastes are generated from the electroplatingand heat treating industries. In addition, commercial hazardous waste treatershave indicated that a high percentage of the cyanide wastes received bytheir facilities are typically identified as D003. These wastes are commonlytreated by the same treatment technologies that are the basis for the proposedtreatment standards for the F007, F008, F009 and F011 wastes. This givesfurther support for the transfer of the treatment standards.b. <T3>Wastes from Chlorinated Aliphatics Production.</T3><ITAG tagnum="26">F024_Wastes including but not limited to, distillation residues, heavyends, tars, and reactor clean-out wastes from the production of chlorinatedaliphatic hydrocarbons, having carbon content from one to five, utilizingfree radical catalyzed processes. [This listing does not include lightends, spent filters and filter aids, spent dessicants, wastewater, wastewatertreatment sludges, spent catalysts, and wastes listed in 261.32]. (2nd)</ITAG>1. <T3>Introduction.</T3> F024 is a listed waste that is generated primarilyby facilities in the organic chemicals manufacturing industry. Detailedtechnical descriptions of the specific production processes generatingF024 can be found in the background document for the listing of this waste.The Agency estimates that there are approximately thirty facilities thatmanufacture chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, having carbon content fromone to five, that could potentially generate F024. These facilities arelocated in the South Central portion of the United States. A brief descriptionof the processes which may generate the listed waste is given below.The production of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, utilizing free radicalcatalyzed processes, typically involves three continuous steps; chlorinationof hydrocarbon feedstocks followed by separation and purification of productstreams, and separation and purification of the different compounds inthe organic product stream. Chlorocarbon or hydrocarbon feedstocks and a chlorine source (i.e., molecularchlorine) are fed into a series of chlorination reactors. In these reactors,the free radical conversions are normally catalyzed by either heat, a combinationof heat and ultraviolet (UV) radiation, or chemicals, such as peroxidesand FeC1<T2>3</T2>. The reactions may be conducted in either the gaseous or liquidphase. The wastes associated with the reaction processes, i.e., reactorresidues, tars, or periodic clean-out wastes are the listed waste F024.After the chlorination step, the effluent from the reactor is sent to afiltration unit where spent catalyst is removed. Spent catalysts are notF024 by virtue of the listing definition. Following filtration, the reactoreffluent undergoes a product separation step where it is quenched or cooledand/or distilled to separate crude product from the unreacted feedstockas well as to prevent decomposition of the product. Unreacted feedstockis recycled to the reactors. Hydrochloric acid is normally a major by-productfrom the chlorination reactions and is subject to recovery either fromvent gases generated from the reactor or from the cooling/quenching step.After the product separation step, the two-phase crude product stream maybe sent to a series of washing, neutralization, and drying units for separationof the product (organic phase) from the acidic aqueous phase. Purificationand separation of the different compounds in the organic product streamis further achieved by distillation. The distillation residues or heavyends from these distillation columns are also the listed waste F024. F024 wastes generally contain 5 percent water, 5 percent chlorinated organicconstituents and 90 percent other nonchlorinated organic constituents.These wastes usually contain high levels of filterable solids. The technologiesthat the Agency has identified for treatment of these wastes are (1) incinerationtechnologies, including rotary kiln and fluidized bed incineration, and(2) solvent extraction. Fluidized bed incineration or rotary kiln incinerationis a destruction technology applicable to organic bearing wastes with solidsconcentrations that prevent use of liquid injection incineration. Solventextraction removes organic constituents from a waste by exploiting therelatively high solubilities of these constituents in a particular solvent.2. <T3>Development of Standards.</T3> For F024, the Agency has data characterizinghazardous constituents from twenty-six sampling and analysis activitiesat sixteen facilities conducted by EPA's hazardous waste listing programand EPA's land disposal restrictions program. EPA performed BDAT testingusing rotary kiln incineration for four F024 wastes representing a broadrange of wastes which meet the definition of F024. Six sample sets of analyticaldata are available for untreated wastes as well as treated wastewatersand nonwastewaters from the rotary kiln incineration testing. Operatingdata collected during this testing show that the technology was properlyoperated; accordingly, all of the above described data were used in thedevelopment of BDAT treatment standards for organic constituents.EPA does not have data that specifically reflect metals treatment in eitherF024 nonwastewaters or wastewaters. However, the Agency does have performancedata on wastes that it believes are sufficiently similar to F024 such thatthe level of performance can be transferred. For nonwastewaters, thesedata consist of 3 treated data points for chromium and nickel representingthe amount of these metals found in the TCLP leachate following stabilizationtreatment of K048/K051 incinerator ash residues at one facility. Operatingdata collected during this testing show that the technology was properlyoperated; accordingly, all of the data were used in the development andtransfer of treatment standards. For wastewaters, the Agency has 3 untreatedand treated analyses for chromium and nickel. The data were collected byEPA from one facility using lime and sulfide precipitation followed byvacuum filtration. Operational data collected during this treatment testingindicate that the technology was properly operated; accordingly, all ofthe data were used in the development and transfer of treatment standards.See Section III.A.5. of this proposed rule for a more detailed discussionrelated to the transfer of treatment standards and the background documentfor this waste code for a discussion of the justification of this transfer.Characterization data for F024 indicate levels of lead in nonwastewatersat treatable quantities. The Agency is currently performing BDAT testingusing stabilization of F024 incinerator ash residues. Depending on theresults of this testing and the level of performance achieved, the Agencymay establish a treatment standard for lead in F024 nonwastewaters andmay adjust the nonwastewater standards for chromium and nickel.EPA has determined that for BDAT List organics in F024 wastes, rotary kilnincineration achieves a level of performance that represents BDAT basedon treatment performance data. The Agency believes, however, that a welldesigned and operated fluidized bed incinerator is an equivalent technologythat will be capable of achieving the BDAT standards. Accordingly, EPAwill use fluidized bed incineration in its estimates of available treatmentcapacity. For BDAT List metals in the incinerator ash, EPA has determinedthat stabilization achieves a level of performance that represents BDAT.For BDAT List metals in the wastewater, EPA has identified chemical precipitationfollowed by vacuum filtration as BDAT. The Agency is aware of four facilities that use rotary kiln incinerationto treat F024 wastes. Therefore, the Agency believes incineration is demonstratedto treat F024. Incineration followed by metals stabilization for the nonwastewaterF024 and chemical precipitation followed by vacuum filtration for the wastewaterF024 are judged to be available to treat F024 because (1) these technologiesare commercially available or can be purchased from a proprietor, and (2)these technologies provide substantial reduction of both organic and metalhazardous constituents. For a detailed description of the reductions exhibitedby treatment of these wastes, refer to the BDAT background document forthis waste.The proposed regulated constituents for F024 and the proposed treatmentstandards for wastewaters and nonwastewaters are presented in the tableat the end of this section. For organic constituents, the standards areexpressed as total constituent concentration, and for the metals, the standardsreflect concentrations in the leachate developed by using the TCLP.The Agency solicits data and information on the generation, waste characterization,and treatment of leachate and wastewater treatment residuals as well asstabilization treatment of metals in nonwastewater residuals that are specificallylisted as F024.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standard for F024 </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/1)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">2-Chloro-1,3-butadiene <D>0.014</D><D>(\1\)  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3-Chloropropene <D>0.014</D><D>(\1\)  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1-Dichloroethane <D>0.014</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichloroethane <D>0.014</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichloropropane <D>0.014</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">cis-1,3-Dichloropropene <D>0.014</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">trans-1,3-Dichloropropene <D>0.014</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate <D>1.8</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Di-n-octyl phthalate <D>1.8</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachloroethane <D>1.8</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>(\1\) </D><D>1.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel (Total) <D>(\1\) </D><D>0.048 </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,5.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for F024</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">2 Chloro-1,3-butadiene <D>0.28 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3-Chloropropene <D>0.28</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1-Dichloroethane <D>0.014 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichloroethane <D>0.014 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2-Dichloropropane <D>0.014 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">cis-1,3-Dichloropropene <D>0.014 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">trans-1,3-Dichloropropene <D>0.014 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate <D>0.036 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Di-n-octyl phthalate <D>0.036 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachloroethane <D>0.036 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (Total) <D>0.35 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel (Total) <D>0.47 </D><D>(\1\)  </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG>c.<T3> Wastes from Pigment Production.</T3><ITAG tagnum="26">K002_Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of chrome yellowand orange pigments.

These wastes were not originally scheduledto be promulgated until May 8, 1990. However, the statute (andSection; 3004(g))does not preclude EPA from prohibiting the land disposal of a given wasteahead of schedule (and the schedule in andSection;andSection; 268.10-268.12itself says that wastes will be evaluated by a given date, indicating thatthe specified date is the latest time by which EPA must act), and in factcompels the Agency to prohibit the land disposal of hazardous wastes assoon as possible.In today's rule, the Agency is proposing to revise the ``No Land DisposalBased on No Generation'' treatment standard (previously promulgated forK004 and K008 nonwastewaters) based on recent information on generationand recycling of these wastes. The Agency is also proposing treatment standardsfor K002, K003 and K006 nonwastewaters based on total recycling and treatmentstandards for K005 and K007 nonwastewaters based on information indicatingcessation of generation. The Agency is proposing that these ``No Land Disposal'' treatment standards,whether based on recycling or no generation, only apply to K002, K003,K004, K005, K006, K007 and K008 nonwastewaters as generated (i.e., thosewastes as defined in the original listing), and not to nonwastewater residuesthat may be potentially generated from management of wastes (i.e., ``derived-from''nonwastewaters) generated prior to promulgation of the ``No Land Disposal''standards. A specific illustration of this applicability can be found in K008 forwhich recycling has been identified as BDAT. Leachate from land disposalunits containing K008 previously generated also carries the label of K008under the ``derived-from'' rule. These leachates could be treated for metalsremoval by precipitation and filtration prior to discharge. The filterednonwastewater residuals would therefore also carry the code of K008 accordingto ``derived-from'' rule. In this case, EPA is proposing that the treatmentstandard of ``No Land Disposal based on Recycling'' would not be applicableto these nonwastewater forms of K008.The Agency's primary rationale for not applying the ``No Land Disposal''treatment standards to these residues (as well as other nonwastewatersthat may be potentially generated from future remedial actions) is theconcern over the differences in waste characteristics of these residuesto the nonwastewaters as originally generated. The basis of the ``No LandDisposal Based on Recycling'' for K008 was based on the characteristicsof the waste as generated. The Agency believes that it is highly likelythat at least some portion of these ``derived-from'' K008 nonwastewatersmay contain a sufficient quantity of impurities that would render it unsuitablefor recycling. Further, where the standard is ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation''for these wastes, it is obvious that if a ``derived-from'' nonwastewateris indeed generated, the basis for the applicability of the standard tothat particular waste is no longer substantiated. Since the Agency anticipatesthat either of these scenarios have a reasonable potential for occurringfor K002, K003, K004, K005, K006, K007, and K008 nonwastewaters, the Agencyis proposing that the ``No Land Disposal'' standards do not apply to ``derived-from''nonwastewaters. However, the Agency is specifically soliciting commenton the need for the development of treatment standards for K002, K003,K004, K005, K006, K007, and K008 ``derived-from'' nonwastewaters. The Agencymust promulgate treatment standards for all remaining wastes by May 8,1990, including these nonwastewater residues generated from the previousmanagement of listed wastes. The Agency has identified some facilities that are manufacturing the pigmentsassociated with these listings but are not generating the listed wastesper se (most of the wastes are wastewater treatment residuals). EPA believesthat this may be a result of source reduction techniques that result incompliance with the Clean Water Act without reliance on wastewater treatmentthat would generate the listed wastes. These wastewaters, while not thelisted wastes, may be regulated as hazardous provided they exceed the EPToxic metal limits or otherwise exhibit a characteristic of a hazardouswaste and are managed outside exempt wastewater treatment tanks. EPA mustestablish treatment standards for all characteristic wastes by May 8, 1990.A discussion of EPA's strategy for establishing treatment standards forcharacteristic wastes can be found in later sections of this preamble.1. <T3>Nonwastewaters.</T3> A treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Basedon No Generation'' for K004 nonwastewaters and K008 nonwastewaters waspromulgated with the First Third wastes on August 8, 1988. During the currentinvestigation of the other wastes from pigment production, the Agency hasobtained information indicating that there are facilities that are manufacturingboth zinc yellow and chrome green oxide pigments. Further, this informationindicates that the oven residues (K008) generated in the production ofchrome oxide green pigments are being generated but are being totally recycled.Similarly, the facilities which reported producing zinc yellow at the beginningof 1988 are not land disposing of any K004 wastes. One facility does nottreat its process wastewaters and does not generate K004. Another facilityis totally recycling all of its wastewater treatment residuals, includingK004. To date, EPA has received no written comments on the treatment standardof ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'' for either K008 or K004.Presumably, this is because generators were not concerned over the needto land dispose this material. EPA's databases confirm this, in that noK004 or K008 wastes were reported land disposed in 1986. However, sincethe information obtained by the Agency refutes the basis for the standard,and for the sake of clarification, EPA is today proposing to revise thetreatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'' for K004and K008 nonwastewaters to ``No Land Disposal Based on Total Recycling''.The information obtained by the Agency indicates that chrome yellow andorange, molybdate orange, and chrome oxide green pigments are manufacturedby a varying number of facilities. Wastewater treatment residuals fromthese facilities, if generated, would correspond to K002, K003, and K006,respectively. Of the facilities known to generate these wastes, one facilitycurrently generates a wastewater treatment sludge that is a mixture ofthese wastes. The facility sometimes sells this mixture as is, mixes itwith other pigments and then sells it, or recycles it back to the productionprocess. The other facility currently treats its process wastewaters usinglead compounds as precipitating agents, and ships the generated sludgesto a secondary lead smelting facility for metals recovery. The Agency findsno reason that these types of recycling and/or recovery techniques cannotbe used on all K002, K003, and K006 nonwastewaters. Therefore, the Agencyis proposing a treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Based on TotalRecycling''. Based on conversations with representatives of manufacturers of inorganicpigments and responses to EPA's andSection; 3007 questionnaires, the Agencybelieves that the last company producing chrome green and iron blue pigments(corresponding to K005 and K007 wastes), shut down production in 1987.Based on this information, the Agency is today proposing a treatment standardof ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'' for K005 and K007 nonwastewaters.2. <T3>Wastewaters.</T3> The Agency is not proposing treatment standards forthe wastewater forms of K004 or K008. Since these wastewaters were FirstThird wastes, their land disposal is restricted by the ``soft hammer''provisions. At this time, the Agency is not proposing treatment standardsfor the wastewater forms of K002, K003, K005, K006 or K007 wastes. TheAgency may develop such treatment standards prior to May 8, 1990, if thereis an identified need for such standards (i.e. if wastewater forms of thelisted waste are proven to be generated). Wastewater forms of these wastesare expected to be generated from only a few sources. Leachate collectedfrom landfills and other land disposal units that contain previously disposedK002, K003, K005, K006 or K007 nonwastewaters carries the listing of thatparticular hazardous waste. The Agency is currently evaluating the possibilityof transferring treatment performance data from wastes having similar physicaland chemical characteristics that are believed to affect treatment performance.The Agency has identified several sources of chromium reduction, cyanidedestruction, and metals precipitation/stabilization performance data whichmay be applicable.If nonwastewater residuals are generated from treatment of these wastewaters,the residuals would also be considered to be the listed wastes, based onthe derived-from rule, and would be required to meet the treatment standardsfor nonwastewaters. Currently, EPA is proceeding with proposing to establishtreatment standards of ``No Land Disposal'' for K002, K003, K005, K006or K007 nonwastewaters. However, as an option, it may decide to promulgatenumerical standards based on a transfer of the nonwastewater standardsfrom wastes with similar chemical and physical characteristics. This decisionwill be based on the perceived need for establishing numerical treatmentstandards for residuals from the treatment of leachate. The Agency solicits data and information on the generation, waste characterization,and treatment of leachate and wastewater treatment residuals that are specificallylisted as K002, K003, K005, K006 or K007 wastes.<ITAG tagnum="71">BDAT Treatment Standard for K004 and K008 (Nonwastewaters) </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="69"><ITAG tagnum="71">NO LAND DISPOSAL BASED ON RECYCLING </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="69"><ITAG tagnum="71">BDAT Treatment Standard for K002, K003 and K006 (Nonwastewaters) </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="69"> <ITAG tagnum="71">NO LAND DISPOSAL BASED ON RECYCLING </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="69"><ITAG tagnum="71">BDAT Treatment Standard for K005 and K007 (Nonwastewaters) </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="69"> <ITAG tagnum="71">NO LAND DISPOSAL BASED ON NO GENERATION</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="69"> d. <T3>Wastes from Acetaldehyde Production.</T3><ITAG tagnum="26">K009_Distillation bottoms from the production of acetaldehyde fromethylene.

(2nd)</ITAG>1. <T3>Introduction.</T3>  K009 and K010 are listed wastes that are generatedprimarily by facilities in the organic chemicals manufacturing industry.Detailed technical descriptions of the specific production processes generatingthese wastes can be found in the background document for the listing ofthese wastes. The Agency estimates that there are two domestic facilitiesthat produce acetaldehyde from ethylene and could potentially generatethe K009 and K010 wastes. These facilities are located in the Southernpart of the United States.The manufacturing process of acetaldehyde, as practiced in the United States,is the liquid phase oxidation of ethylene developed by Wacker-Chemie andHoechst. One facility reports using 100% pure ethylene and the other amixture of 90% ethylene and 10% ethanol. Ethylene is catalytically oxidizedwith air in dilute hydrochloric acid solution containing the chloridesof palladium (Pd) and copper (Cu) in a tubular reactor. The reaction productsare flash evaporated and the product acetaldehyde passes overhead to thecrude distillation column. The aqueous bottoms go to a reactor where thePd catalyst is regenerated and recycled to the acetaldehyde reactor. Theoverhead from the crude distillation column is condensed; unreacted ethyleneand light hydrocarbons (including a small amount of acetaldehyde) are vented.The crude acetaldehyde from the bottom of this column then goes to finaldistillation. This crude distillation column yields two wastes: the bottomsand the side cuts. The distillation bottoms (discharge wastewaters) containinghigh-boiling organic impurities leaves the still bottom which form thelisted waste K009. The side cut stream consist of higher boiling organicand chlorinated organics is removed as a side stream higher up the columnwhich form the listed waste K010.2.<T3> Development of Treatment Standards. </T3>For waste codes K009 andK010, a careful review of waste generation, waste management practices,and waste characterization data was conducted to determine whether thesewaste codes could be combined into one or more waste treatability groups.Based on this review, K009 and K010 were established as two separate wastetreatability groups.Although these wastes are generated by similar processes the EPA has datashowing that K009 wastes are typically less than one percent total organiccarbon (TOC) and less than one percent total suspended solids (TSS) andtherefore, as originally generated, are classified as wastewaters for thepurpose of establishing BDAT. In contrast, EPA has received data showingthat K010 wastes are typically over one percent TOC and therefore, as originallygenerated, are classified as nonwastewaters. Residuals generated from thetreatment of either K009 or K010 would then be classified as wastewatersor nonwastewaters, depending on their appropriate characteristics of TOCand TSS. Although these wastes represent two different treatability groups,they are presented in this section because they are generated by the sameindustry. In addition, these wastes contain similar constituents and inrelatively similar concentrations, the standards that EPA is proposingfor K009 wastewaters are identical to those proposed for wastewaters derivedfrom the treatment of K010 nonwastewaters (and vice versa). i.<T3> Wastewaters.</T3> K009 contains treatable concentrations of BDAT listorganics, such as, acrolein, acrylonitrile, benzene, chloroform, 1,1-dichloroethane,2,4-dinitrophenol, ethyl acetate, ethyl methacrylate, methylene chloride,methyl chloride, and toluene. Non-BDAT organic constituents present attreatable concentrations include formaldehyde, acetyl chloride, chloral,paraldehyde, chloroacetaldehyde, and acetic acid. BDAT metals present inthe waste at low concentration include chromium (total), mercury, and lead.EPA has identified the following technologies as potentially applicablefor treatment of the K009 treatability group: (1) hydrolysis followed bybiological treatment, followed by incineration of biomass; (2) hydrolysisfollowed by either carbon adsorption or steam stripping, followed by incineration;(3) biological treatment in combination with either steam stripping oractivated carbon; (4) steam stripping followed by carbon adsorption; and(5) wet air oxidation followed by biological treatment. Also, EPA has identifiedthe following technologies as potentially applicable for treatment of theK010 treatability group: (1) incineration, (2) fuel substitution, (3) solventextraction followed by recovery or incineration of the contaminated solvent,and (4) recycle or reuse. The technologies EPA has identified as an applicable treatment for thetreatability group of K009 are believed to be capable of removing, concentrating,and/or destroying the organic hazardous constituents present in these wastes.For example, biological treatment, hydrolysis, and wet air oxidation aretechnologies known to treat wastewaters having relatively low concentrationsof hazardous organic constituents. But these technologies, alone, are notcandidates for BDAT because the treated residuals typically need to undergofurther treatment such as incineration prior to disposal. For instance,a carbon adsorption column or a steam stripping may be used to remove hazardousorganic constituents present in the treated wastewater effluents from thesetechnologies. Typically, the presence of hazardous organic constituentsin these technologies' treated effluents are a direct result of untreatedconstituents or undesirable reaction products. Detailed information regardingthese technologies' applicability to treatment of hazardous organic wastewaterscan be found in the <T3>Guidance Document of Applicable Technologies for Listed Hazardous Wastes.</T3>The Agency has determined that out of two facilities generating the K009wastes there is one facility currently treating these wastes via a proprietaryhydrolysis process followed by biological treatment followed by rotarykiln incineration of biomass. The Agency has determined that out of twofacilities generating the K010 wastes there is one facility currently treatingthese wastes via recycling. The facility recycling K010 wastes managesresidues from recycling K010 as described above for K009. The Agency hasdetermined that the other facility disposes of K009 and K010 wastes viaunderground injection wells. A facility treating K009 wastewaters via a proprietary hydrolysis processsubmitted data on the treatment of K009 wastewaters. The Agency believesthat hydrolysis alone is not a candidate for BDAT because the technologyleaves behind significant amounts of hazardous organic constituents thatrequire further treatment prior to disposal. This facility has informedthe Agency that it intends to re-submit data pertinent to its hydrolysisprocess and other treatment trains applicable to K009 and K010 wastes.These data are expected to be available during the comment period of thisrule. EPA's Office of Water (OW) performance data supporting the developmentof rules for the Organic Chemicals, Plastic and Synthetic Fibers (OCPSF)industries was reviewed for possible application to K009 and K010. EPAdetermined that K009 and K010 wastewaters are already regulated, in part,under OCPSF final rules applicable to the Commodity Organic Chemicals (COC)industry subcategory (see 40 CFR Part 414, Subpart F, andSection;andSection;414.60-414.66). Additional relevant BAT limitations can be found in 40CFR Part 414, Subparts I and J. BAT limitations were based on the treatmentof wastewaters similar to K009 and K010 wastewaters. Further, each of thetechnologies or combination of technologies used in the BAT limitationsare considered BDAT for K009 and K010 wastewaters because these technologieswere demonstrated for wastewaters similar to K009 and K010 wastewaters.Therefore, EPA is numerical treatment standards for the organic constituentsin K009 and K010 based on a transfer of a portion of the treatment performancedata contained in the Office of Water OCPSF database. The BAT effluent limitations are based on priority pollutant data and datafrom other industry plants with well-designed and well-operated BAT models.The concentration-based BAT effluent limitations hinge on the performanceof the end-of-pipe treatment component (biological treatment for the end-of-pipebiological treatment subcategory and physical/chemical treatment for thenon-end-of-pipe treatment subcategory) plus in-plant pretreatment technologiesthat remove pollutants prior to discharge to the end-of-pipe treatmentsystem. The pretreatment technologies include steam stripping, activatedcarbon, hydroxide precipitation for metals, alkaline chlorination for cyanide,and in-plant biological treatment. The Agency believes these technologiesrepresent BDAT candidates for treatment of the BDAT list hazardous organicconstituents present in the K009 and K010 wastewaters because these technologieswere determined to be well-designed and well-operated, substantially reducethe amount of organics, and these technologies are commercially available.In addition, EPA does not believe that the requirement that BAT be economicallyachievable would result in a different technology selection, in this case,under the criteria established for BDAT under HSWA. OW determined that these BAT limitations are applicable to K009 and K010wastewaters, one of the industrial process wastewaters that was sampledas part of OW efforts to characterize and to subcategorize OCPSF industries.Therefore, EPA is proposing to transfer some of these BAT effluent limitationsas BDAT standards for K009 and K010 wastewaters. The Agency is currently evaluating the validity and reliability of availableanalytical methods being employed to characterize some of the non-BDATList organic constituents present in K009 and K010 wastes. The Agency isalso evaluating the possibility of establishing a method, parameter, orconstituent that could be used as either a surrogate or indicator of treatmentof these non-BDAT List organics. Potential parameters under considerationare BOD, COD, TOC, total volatile content, total semivolatile content,and total chlorine content. The Agency does not expect these non-BDAT constituentsto interfere or behave differently from the BDAT list constituents identifiedas constituents candidate for regulation in K009 wastewaters. However,the Agency solicits information that can substantiate the likelihood ofthese constituents to behave differently or to interfere with the treatmentof other BDAT List organic constituents. If such data become available,the Agency may need either to defer regulation on these non-BDAT List constituentsto a later date or to set additional requirements for K009 wastes. If the reliability and validity of analytical methods cannot be determinedprior to promulgation or 1990, the Agency would be unable to develop numericaltreatment standards for these non-BDAT List constituents. Similarly, ifthe Agency fails to identify a surrogate parameter or indicator constituentthat would account for either the destruction or removal of these non-BDATlist organic constituents, the Agency would be unable to set a surrogateparameter or indicator constituent that would indicate that treatment ofthese organic constituents has been accomplished. As a result, the Agencymay consider amending, at a later date, treatment standards establishedfor the K009 to include a method of treatment such as either carbon adsorptionor steam stripping of K009 wastewaters prior to land disposal.In summary, the Agency is proposing treatment standards for K009 and K010wastewaters based on the performance data that was used to support theOCPSF BAT effluent limitations applicable to COC industry subcategory.EPA has determined that treatment of K009 and K010 wastewaters in welldesigned and well operated biological treatment units, steam strippingunits, and/or steam stripping followed by biological treatment units representsBDAT for wastewaters forms of K009 and K010. The regulated constituents,the treatment standards, and the treatment trains applicable to hazardousconstituents in K009 and K010 wastewaters are listed at the end of thissection. ii. <T3>Nonwastewaters.</T3> K010 contains a total concentration of chlorinatedorganic compounds of approximately 20 ppm. Those chlorinated organics andother organics appear to be identical to those identified in K009. However,K010 has slightly higher concentrations of the chlorinated organic andthe other organics. BDAT metals present in the waste above detection levelsare chromium (total) and lead. K010 has a heat content of approximately1,660 BTU/lb. K010 wastes as typically generated are in excess of one percentTOC and are classified as nonwastewaters. Therefore, based on waste generationand waste characteristics, K010 wastes are nonwastewaters and have beenplaced in a separate waste treatability group from K009 wastes. One of the facilities submitting data has claimed that its K010 wastesare beneficially reused. Also, the facility reported that the recyclingof K010 wastes results in a waste stream that is classified as a wastewater(i.e., containing andless;1% TSS and andless;1% TOC). Based on the informationsubmitted by this facility, the Agency believes that this facility recyclingof K010 wastes is a legitimate recycling practice that by no means shouldbe interpreted as either evaporation or dilution of the restricted wastesin order to avoid regulation. The technologies EPA has identified as an applicable treatment for thetreatability group of K010 are believed to be capable of removing, concentrating,and/or destroying the organic hazardous constituents present in these wastes.EPA has identified incineration as a potential demonstrated treatment technologyfor organic hazardous constituents in K010. Fuel substitution involvesthe use of combustible organic wastes as substitutes for conventional fuelsburned in high temperature industrial processes. In order for a waste tobe a good candidate for a fuel substitute, the waste must have a reasonablehigh concentration of organic chemicals with sufficient heat content (BTUper pound). Also, it must have a relatively low concentration of noncombustiblematerials such as ash, water, metals, and chlorine. The Agency believesthat burning of K010 wastes in a well designed and well operated high temperatureindustrial boiler or kiln attains the performance achievable by other thermaldestruction units such as a fluidized bed, rotary kiln, and liquid injectionincinerators. The burning of K010 may result in incineration/fuel substitution scrubberwaters. Ashes from the burning of K010 are not generated due to typicallow ash contents. However, nonwastewater forms of K010, after incineration,may result from the treatment or filtration of the scrubber waters. Scrubberwaters may need additional treatment prior to disposal in order to removemetals. Detailed information regarding these technologies applicabilityto treatment of hazardous organic nonwastewaters can be found in the <T3>Guidance Document of Applicable Technologies for Listed Hazardous Wastes.</T3>The Agency has been unable to identify any facility using solvent extraction,prior to disposal or reuse, for treatment of K010 or wastes judged to besimilar. However, the Agency believes this technology may be technicallycapable of recovery of valuable constituents from K010 prior to disposal.At least one facility reported recycling of K010 wastes and residues fromthese practice are reported to be co-treated with K009 wastes. The Agency has data from rotary kiln incineration of K019 wastes whichthe Agency intends to propose to transfer as treatment standards for K009and K010 nonwastewaters. Characterization data for K019 wastes show thatK019 wastes have similar chlorinated organic hazardous constituents tothose present in K010 nonwastewaters. The Agency believes that K019 isa waste more difficult to treat than K010 because K019 show higher concentrationsof those chlorinated organic hazardous constituents found to be similaror more difficult to treat. The Agency concluded that rotary kiln incineration of K019 wastes representedBDAT because the technology provided the best available treatment for K019wastes. The Agency believes that is technically feasible to transfer thenumerical treatment standards established for K019 to K009 and K010 nonwastewaters.Therefore, EPA is proposing numerical treatment standards for K010 nonwastewatersbased on the performance of rotary kiln incineration for K019 wastes.

Numerical treatment standards, based on the performanceof incineration in a rotary kiln, for the wastewater and nonwastewaterforms of K019 were proposed with the First Third wastes and promulgatedon August 8, 1988. In addition, a treatment standard of ``No Land DisposalBased on No Generation'' for nonwastewater forms of K025 was also proposedand promulgated with the First Third wastes. A treatment standard of ``NoLand Disposal Based on No Generation'' for wastewater forms of K025 wasalso proposed with the First Third wastes, but was not promulgated becausethe Agency determined that K025 wastewaters could be generated as leachatefrom previously land disposed K025 nonwastewaters (i.e., the basis of thestandard, ``no generation'' of wastewaters, was not valid). While EPA did not promulgate treatment standards for the K025 wastewaterson August 8, 1988, the ``soft hammer'' provisions did not apply becauseK025 wastes were originally scheduled with the Second Third wastes. Sincethe Agency is not proposing treatment standards for these wastewaters intoday's rule and will not be able to promulgate any for them by the statutorydeadline, land disposal of K025 wastewaters will now be restricted accordingto the ``soft hammer'' provisions in andSection; 268.8. EPA is presenting this information in today's preamble, as a matter ofconvenience, in order to show all existing and proposed treatment standardsfor the Second Third wastes. EPA is not reopening the comment period onthe promulgated numerical treatment standards for K019 wastes or on thepromulgated ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'' for K025 nonwastewater.The Agency has established variance procedures for those facilities thatmust land dispose these wastes and cannot meet the promulgated treatmentstandards. These variance procedures are outlined in 40 CFR 268.44. f. <T3>Wastes from Phthalic Anhydride Production.</T3><ITAG tagnum="26">K023_Distillation light ends from the production of phthalic anhydridefrom naphthalene.

(3rd)</ITAG>K023, K093 and K094 are all Third Third Wastes that are generated fromthe production of phthalic anhydride. These wastes were not originallyscheduled to be promulgated until May 8, l990. However, the statute doesnot preclude EPA from prohibiting the land disposal of any given wasteahead of schedule and in fact compels the Agency to prohibit the land disposalof hazardous wastes as soon as possible. The Agency has data on the incineration of K024 nonwastewaters (distillationbottoms from the production of phthalic anhydride from naphthalene) thatalso contain phthalic anhydride. Treatment standards for K024 wastewatersand nonwastewaters were promulgated with the First Third wastes on August8, 1988. These standards were based on the performance of incinerationof K024 nonwastewaters in a rotary kiln and the concentrations of hazardousconstituents found in the ash and scrubber water residuals. In today'srule, the Agency is proposing to directly transfer these treatment standardsto K023, K093 and K094. The Agency has determined that the treatment standards for K024 may betransferred to these wastes because: (1) All of these wastes are generatedfrom the production of phthalic anhydride; (2) All of these wastes appearto contain similar concentrations of phthalic anhydride, high BTU content,and low concentrations of BDAT metals; (3) Distillation residues generatedfrom production processes using naphthalene (corresponding to K023 andK024 wastes) are expected to contain higher concentrations of less volatileconstituents than the distillation residues generated from production processesusing ortho-xylene (corresponding to K093 and K094 wastes). Since the constituentsin K023 and K024 are less volatile, they are also less easily vaporizedin a rotary kiln and subsequently destroyed; and (4) Distillation bottoms(K024) are expected to contain higher concentrations of less volatile constituentsthan the distillation light ends (K023). Again, since these constituentsare less volatile, they are also less easily vaporized in a rotary kilnand subsequently destroyed. Based on this analysis, the Agency has determined that K024 representsthe most difficult to treat of the four wastes generated from the productionof phthalic anhydride. Therefore, the Agency is proposing to transfer theperformance data from the incinerations of K024 to the less difficult totreat K023, K093, and K094.While the proposed treatment standards for K023, K093 and K094 are basedon the performance of incineration of K024 in a rotary kiln, other treatmenttechnologies such as fluidized bed incineration, fuel substitution units,biodegradation, and solvent extraction, that can achieve these standardsare not precluded from use by this rule. The Agency is currently unawareof any alternative treatment or recycling technologies that have been examinedspecifically for these wastes and solicits data and comments on these.The Agency has data that indicates that there are relatively few generatorsof K023, K093 and K094. Information also suggests that many of these wastes,as generated, are not typically land disposed. The Agency considered proposinga treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'' forthe nonwastewater forms of K023, K093 and K094. However, the Agency prefersto establish numerical standards whenever a transfer of standards can bereasonably performed. EPA has determined that incineration in a rotary kiln will achieve a levelof performance that represents the best demonstrated available treatmenttechnology (BDAT) for nonwastewater forms of K023, K093 and K094. EPA isproposing to directly transfer the K024 wastewater and nonwastewater treatmentstandards to K023, K093 and K094 wastewaters and nonwastewaters respectively.While phthalic anhydride is the primary hazardous constituent in K023,K024, K093 and K094, it is readily hydrolyzed by water to phthalic acid.Thus, phthalic anhydride cannot be directly analyzed. However, there isan analytical method for phthalic acid. Thus, the treatment standards forK024 wastewaters and nonwastewaters are based on analyses for phthalicacid. This constituent, although not listed as a hazardous constituentin Part 261 Appendix VIII, was chosen as a surrogate compound for phthalicanhydride. The proposed treatment standards for K023, K093 and K094 wastesare based on analysis of total constituent concentration for phthalic acidand are listed in the tables at the end of this section.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,10,r42</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>023, <T4>K</T4>093 <T4>and K</T4>094<ITAG tagnum="96"> [Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total Composition (mg/kg)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Phthalic acid <D>28 </D><D>Not applicable.</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,10,r42 </C><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>023, <T4>K</T4>093 <T4>and K</T4>094<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total Composition (mg/l)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Phthalic acid <D>0.54 </D><D>Not applicable.</D></ITAG></ITAG> g. <T3>Wastes from the Production of Dinitrotoluene, Toluene Diamine and TolueneDiisocyanate.</T3><ITAG tagnum="26">K027_Centrifuge and distillation residues from toluene diisocyanateproduction.

(lst)</ITAG>1. <T3>Introduction. </T3>K027, K111-K116, U221, and U223 are all listed wastesthat are generated primarily by facilities in the organic chemicals manufacturingindustry. Detailed technical descriptions of the specific production processesgenerating these wastes can be found in the background document for thelisting of these wastes. The Agency estimates that there are approximatelyeight facilities manufacturing dinitrotoluene (DNT), toluenediamine (TDA),and/or toluene diisocyanate (TDI) that could potentially generate theselisted wastes. In addition, there are other facilities that may potentiallygenerate U221 and U223 wastes. The facilities manufacturing DNT, TDA, andTDI are located in the Southern and Eastern parts of the United States.The manufacturing process of TDI typically involves three continuous chemicalprocesses: (1) Nitration of toluene to form DNT; (2) Hydrogenation of DNTto form TDA; and (3) Phosgenation of TDA to form TDI. Because the facilitiesgenerating these products have similar manufacturing processes and therespective wastes appear to contain similar chemical constituents, theAgency decided to investigate the feasibility of creating a minimum numberof treatability groups for these wastes. EPA conducted a careful reviewof waste generation, waste management practices, and waste characterizationdata for these wastes. Based on this review, EPA believes that these wastescomprise two waste treatability groups: (1) the K027, K113-K116, U221,and U223 treatability group and (2) the K111 and K112 treatability group.The following two sections provide EPA's rationale for establishing thesetreatability groups and the development of treatment standards for each.2. <T3>Development of Standards for the K027, K113-K116, U221 and U223 TreatabilityGroup. </T3>K027 and K113-K116, as generated, are usually nonwastewaterscontaining high concentrations of aromatic organonitrogen compounds. Specifically,the Agency believes that K027 and K113-K115 are expected to contain highconcentrations of TDA. Besides the organonitrogen compounds TDA and TDI,K116 is expected to contain high concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbonssuch as carbon tetrachloride and phosgene. K027, K123, K114 and K116 areexpected to contain, if any, very low concentrations of metals. However,available data show that K115, as originally generated, contains treatableconcentrations of nickel (up to approximately 5%). The Agency has informationshowing that facilities generating K027 and K113-K116 usually either treator dispose these wastes in the same or similar units.Although the Agency lacks characterization data for the U221 and U223 wastes,the Agency believes that organic constituents present will consist mostlyof TDA in U221 and of TDI in U223 wastes. Since TDI and TDA products aregenerated from similar manufacturing processes, EPA believes that any impuritiesin either commercial chemical products or off-specification chemical productsmeeting the listing criteria for U221 and U223 will consist of constituentssimilar to those typically shown or expected to be contained in K027, K115and K116. As a result, the Agency expects U221 and U223 to show treatmentcharacteristics similar to these K wastes. Information collected by theAgency indicates that both of these U wastes are amenable to the same treatmenttechnologies that are applicable to these K wastes. Therefore, EPA placedU221 and U223 wastes into the same treatability group of these K wastes.For nonwastewater forms of this treatability group, EPA has identifiedthe following technologies as potentially applicable for treatment of thehazardous organic constituents contain in these wastes: (1) solvent extractionfollowed by recovery or incineration of the contaminated solvent; (2) recycleor reuse; (3) fuel substitution; and (4) incineration. EPA has identifiedstabilization as potentially applicable treatment of BDAT list metals containedin K115 only.The Agency has been unable to identify any facility using solvent extractionfor treatment of these wastes or any wastes that the Agency believes wouldbe sufficiently similar to these wastes. At least one facility reportedprevious recycling of K027 wastes, but has since ceased this practice.One facility also reported recycling K113 and U223, but occasionally incineratesK113. EPA has thus determined that solvent extraction is not currentlydemonstrated for these nonwastewaters.The Agency has determined that out of eight facilities generating thesewastes, three facilities are currently incinerating these wastes. Thereare at least three facilities handling K027 and/or K113-K116 by fuel substitutionin high temperature industrial boilers. Two facilities incinerating K027reported treating K113-K115 or K116 by fuel substitution and one facilitytreating K027 by fuel substitution. Therefore, the Agency has determinedthat both fuel substitution and incineration are demonstrated for organicconstituents present in these K wastes.The burning of these nonwastewaters may result in incineration/fuel substitutionscrubber waters that would be classified as wastewaters with the respectivewaste codes. The Agency believes that ashes from the burning of these wastesare not typically generated due to typical low ash contents. However, treatmentor filtration of the scrubber waters may result in a treatment residualthat would be classified as a nonwastewater with the respective waste codes.The majority of the facilities burning these wastes either by fuel substitutionor incineration reported the generation of incineration scrubber waters.For BDAT list metals, available characterization data show treatable concentrationsof nickel in untreated K115 (up to approximately 5%). The Agency does nothave characterization data for the concentration of nickel in K115 incinerationtreatment residuals, such as ashes, and sludges. The Agency believes thatdue to the high level of nickel in the untreated K115, the nonwastewatertreatment residues of fuel substitution and incineration would requirefurther treatment. As a result, the Agency is proposing to regulate nickelin K115 nonwastewaters. To do so, EPA examined its performance data forthe First Third wastes and is proposing to transfer the nickel standardsfor F006 nonwastewaters (based on stabilization) to K115 nonwastewaters.This is because the Agency believes that nonwastewater residuals from theincineration and/or fuel substitution of K115 are amenable to stabilizationtreatment. Also, the Agency believes that none of the constituents presentin these treatment residuals, if any, are likely to interfere with thetreatment of nickel. EPA's rationale for developing the numerical standardapplicable to K115 is provided in the BDAT background document for thistreatability group.At this time, EPA does not have any specific performance treatment datafor the organics contained in any of the wastes in this treatability groupnor has the Agency pursued any performance testing of any particular treatmentprocess for these wastes. This is because EPA currently lacks analyticalmethods that can satisfactorily analyze for toluidine, TDI, TDA, and othermajor organic constituents (i.e., the constituents that would be selectedfor regulation due to their anticipated high concentrations in the untreatedwastes) in complex waste matrices. Nor has the Agency been able to identifyany method, parameters, or indicator constituents for the hazardous organicconstituents present in these wastes. Therefore, the Agency believes thatnumerical BDAT treatment standards for the organic constituents presentin these wastes cannot be developed at this time.However, the Agency believes that incineration and fuel substitution aredemonstrated and are the best technologies currently available to treatthis treatability group. The Agency has data showing that incinerationtypically provides substantial reduction in concentration of most organichazardous constituents in wastes. Typically, many can be reduced to nondetectablelevels as measured in the residues from incineration (i.e., ash and scrubberwater). EPA has data on incineration for a variety of organic compoundsfrom many different regulatory programs.Based on all of this information, EPA has determined that incinerationand fuel substitution represent BDAT for K027, K113-K116, U221, and U223.First, the Agency has found that for all of the First Third wastes thatwere treated by incineration, the treatment levels achieved by incinerationrepresented BDAT. Also, this determination has been demonstrated for welldesigned and well operated fuel substitution units from which EPA has developedtreatment standards. Therefore, the Agency believes that if incinerationand fuel substitution have been demonstrated to represent the best treatmentfor wastes with similar treatability characteristics or for wastes havingorganic hazardous constituents that are more difficult to incinerate, thenincineration and fuel substitution are also demonstrated for these K wastes.Finally, EPA's records document the common use of incineration and fuelsubstitution as methods of treatment for these wastes.As a result, EPA is proposing to specify using either incineration or fuelsubstitution as a method of treatment for these K wastes rather than anumerical standard. K115 wastes must comply with both: (1) Any of the methodsof treatment requirements and (2) the numerical treatment standards proposedfor nickel. The Agency believes that by specifying these technologies asmethods of treatment the Agency fully complies with the land disposal restrictionsmandated by Congress. This is because: (1) EPA has determined that theK wastes discussed in this section are amenable to incineration and (2)EPA has determined that these technologies represent BDAT for these K wastes.Treatment residuals from either incinerators or fuel substitution unitsburning of these K wastes are not prohibited from land disposal. The Agencybelieves that these treatment methods will provide a substantial reductionof the amount of hazardous organic constituents present in these wastes.It is also important to point out that EPA requires that an incineratorburning RCRA hazardous wastes must meet the requirements specified in 40CFR Part 264 Subpart O or Part 265 Subpart O. Compliance with 40 CFR Part266 would have to be required for any hazardous waste burned for energyrecovery in fuel substitution units. The Agency believes that these technologiesare available because: (1) These technologies are commercially availableor can be purchased from a proprietor and (2) these technologies achievesubstantial reduction of organic hazardous constituents of wastes judgedto be more difficult to treat than those organics in these K wastes.For wastewater forms of wastes in this treatability group, EPA has identifiedcarbon adsorption followed by incineration of the spent carbon as potentiallyapplicable treatment technologies for the hazardous organic constituentscontained in these wastewaters. EPA has identified chemical precipitationfollowed by filtration as a potentially applicable treatment technologyfor the BDAT list metals contained in K115 only.Wastes in this treatability group, as originally generated, are typicallyclassified as nonwastewaters. However, the Agency believes that wastewaterforms of these wastes can result from either RCRA corrective actions orCERCLA remedial actions (e.g., leachate and contaminated ground water).Therefore, these types of wastewaters are also subject to the land disposalrestrictions of HSWA according to 40 CFR 268.EPA believes that any of the organonitrogen compounds contained in wastewaterforms of this treatability group can easily be adsorbed on carbon. Availabledata suggest that the organonitrogen compounds comprising these wastes,as originally generated, are aromatic in nature and thus, their chemicalstructures and physical properties (e.g., high molecular weight) make themamenable to carbon adsorption treatment. Therefore, EPA is proposing to specify carbon adsorption as a method oftreatment for the organic constituents in wastewater forms of K027, K113-K116,U221, and U223. In addition, K115 wastewaters must comply with both: (1)The method of treatment requirement and (2) the numerical treatment standardproposed for nickel. The effluent wastewater from carbon adsorption ofthese wastewaters is not prohibited from land disposal (provided that theadditional standards for nickel is subsequently achieved for those wastewatersidentified as K115). However, the spent carbon resulting from this treatmentprocess must comply with the nonwastewater standards applicable to thesewastes. The Agency does not have characterization data for the concentration ofnickel in K115 incineration scrubber waters. However, the Agency believesthat these wastewaters will contain treatable concentrations of nickel.As a result, the Agency is proposing to regulate nickel in K115 wastewaters.To do so, EPA examined its performance data for the First Third and determinedthat it is technically feasible to transfer the nickel standards the EPAestablished for other First Third wastewaters to K115 incineration wastewaters.This is because the Agency believes that the incineration and fuel substitutionresiduals being classified as K115 wastewaters are amenable to chemicalprecipitation (lime and sulfide) treatment followed by filtration (vacuumfiltration). Also, the Agency believes that none of the hazardous constituentspresent in the K115 treatment residuals are likely to interfere with thetreatability of nickel. EPA's rationale for developing the numerical standardapplicable to K115 is provided in the background document for this treatabilitygroup.3. <T3>Deferral of Treatment Standards for the K111 and K112 TreatabilityGroup.</T3> The Agency has determined that K111 and K112 represent a separatewaste treatability group. As generated, they are usually wastewaters containinglow concentrations of organic compounds (less than 1% by weight) and verylow concentrations of metals. In addition, these wastes are often co-disposedor co-treated in wastewater treatment systems. For hazardous organic constituents in K111 and K112 wastewaters, EPA hasidentified the following technologies as potentially applicable: (1) biologicaltreatment followed by incineration of the biomass; (2) carbon adsorptionfollowed by incineration of the spent carbon; (3) chemical oxidation; and(4) solvent extraction followed either by incineration or recycling ofthe extracted organics. All of these treatment processes would generatenonwastewater residuals (e.g., spent biomass, spent carbon, and solventextract, respectively) that may then be required to be incinerated in afluidized bed, multiple hearth, or rotary kiln. EPA has been unable toidentify a facility currently using solvent extraction for either K111or K112 wastes. The Agency has determined that out of eight facilities generating the K111and K112 wastes, there are three facilities currently treating these wastesin biological treatment units and three facilities using carbon adsorptionas either treatment or a polishing step prior to disposal. Currently, EPA lacks performance treatment data from facilities currentlytreating these wastes either by biological treatment or carbon adsorptionfollowed by incineration nor has EPA conducted any test to collect suchdata. This is because EPA has the same analytical problems already discussedfor K027, K113-K116, U221, and U223. At this time, EPA is not proposing any treatment standard for wastes identifiedas K111 and K112 wastewaters. Since these wastes were listed after theeffective dates of the 1984 RCRA amendments, the agency believes that landdisposal of these wastes is not subject to the ``soft hammer'' provisions.The Agency does not believe that incineration is applicable for K111 andK112 wastewaters; however, residues from treatment of K111 and K112 wastewatersthat are identified as K111 and K112 nonwastewaters may require incinerationprior to disposal.<ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">BDAT Treatment Standard for K027, K113-K116, U221 and U223</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">(Nonwastewaters)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">EITHER INCINERATION OR FUEL SUBSTITUTION_AS A METHOD OF TREATMENT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">BDAT Treatment Standard for K027, K113-K116, U221 and U223</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">(Wastewaters)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">CARBON ADSORPTION AS A METHOD OF TREATMENT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>115 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any Single Grab Sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel<D>Not applicable</D><D>0.32</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,10,r42</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>115<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any Single Grab Sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel<D>0.47</D><D>Not Applicable.</D></ITAG></ITAG>h. <T3>Wastes from 1,1,1-Trichloroethane Production.</T3><ITAG tagnum="26">K028_Spent catalyst from the hydrochlorinator reactor in the productionof 1,1,1-trichloroethane.

Detailed technical descriptions of the specific production processesgenerating these wastes can be found in the background document for thelisting of these wastes. The Agency estimates that there are approximatelythree facilities manufacturing 1,1,1-trichloroethane that could potentiallygenerate these listed wastes. These facilities are located in the SouthCentral portion of the United States.2. <T3>Standards for K028. </T3>1,1,1-Trichloroethane is produced commerciallyby the catalytic hydrochlorination of vinyl chloride. Vinyl chloride andhydrogen chloride are reacted in the presence of a ferric chloride catalystto produce 1,1-dichloroethane as an intermediate chemical. The spent catalystis separated from the product stream via filtration or distillation. Thisspent catalyst stream is the listed waste K028. The 1,1-dichloroethaneintermediate is then reacted with chlorine gas to produce 1,1,1-trichloroethane.K028 wastes generally contain greater than 50 percent chlorinated organics,with the balance of the waste comprised of heavy tars and spent ferricchloride catalyst. The waste generally contains high levels of filterablesolids and has a moderate heating value. Consistent quantitative analysisof untreated K028 proved to be very difficult. Some of the problems weredue to the volatility of the 1,1-dichloroethane, the reactivity of theresidual ferric chloride catalyst, and the presence of tarry materialsin the waste. It was particularly difficult to perform analyses for metalsand solids content. The Agency has identified incineration as an applicable technology fortreatment of K028. While the Agency has been unable to obtain performancedata based on incineration for K028, the Agency is aware of two facilitiesthat are currently using rotary kiln incineration to treat K028 waste.Therefore, the Agency believes that incineration is demonstrated for K028.In addition, the Agency does have performance data on the incinerationof K019 and F024. Characterization data from four sampling activities atthree facilities show that K028 wastes have chemical and physical wastecharacteristics that are similar to those of K019 and F024 wastes: allthree wastes having significant concentrations of two-carbon chlorinatedorganic compounds. Consistent with EPA's methodology for transfer of treatmentstandards, the Agency is proposing to transfer treatment data from rotarykiln incineration of waste code F024 for the organic constituents in K028.For the inorganic constituents in K028, the Agency is proposing to transfertreatment data from the ash stabilization of K048-K052 and treatment datafrom the lime and sulfide precipitation of K062. Details on the transferof performance data and the development of treatment standards for K028wastes can be found in the BDAT background document for this waste. The Agency is proposing to transfer performance data for organic constituentsin K028 from the incineration of F024. Incineration has been demonstratedto treat K028. The Agency also believes incineration is available because(1) it is commercially available or can be purchased from a proprietor,and (2) it provides substantial reduction of the concentration of organichazardous constituents. The regulated constituents for K028 wastes andthe treatment standards for wastewaters and nonwastewaters are listed atthe end of this section. 3. <T3>Standards for K029, K095 and K096.</T3> Review of the available informationindicates that K029, K095 and K096 as originally generated according tothe listing, are usually nonwastewaters containing relatively high concentrationsof chlorinated organics. EPA believes that these wastes may contain concentrationsof halogenated organics such that they should already be restricted fromland disposal according to the California List rule for Halogenated OrganicCompounds (HOCs). Available information indicates that many K029 wastes are no longer beinggenerated and that K095 and K096 wastes are recycled. EPA is proposinga standard of ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'' for K029 nonwastewatersand ``No Land Disposal Based on Recycling'' for K095 and K096 nonwastewaters.The Agency is proposing that these ``No Land Disposal'' treatment standards,only apply to K029, K095 and K096 nonwastewaters as generated (i.e., thosewastes as defined in the original listing), and not to nonwastewater residuesthat may be potentially generated from management of wastes (i.e., ``derived-from''nonwastewaters) generated prior to promulgation of the ``No Land Disposal''standards. A specific illustration of this applicability for K095 and K096 for whichrecycling has been identified as BDAT is as follows: Leachate from landdisposal units containing K095 previously generated also carries the labelof K095 under the ``derived-from'' rule. These leachates could be treatedby chemical oxidation, precipitation, filtration and/or carbon adsorptionprior to discharge. The filtered nonwastewater residuals and the spentcarbon would therefore also carry the code of K095 according to ``derived-from''rule. In this case, EPA is proposing that the treatment standard of ``NoLand Disposal Based on Recycling'' would not be applicable to these nonwastewaterforms of K095. The Agency's primary rationale for not applying the ``No Land Disposal''treatment standards to these residues (as well as other nonwastewatersthat may be potentially generated from future remedial actions) is theconcern over the differences in waste characteristics of these residuesto the nonwastewaters as originally generated. The basis of the ``No LandDisposal Based on Recycling'' for K095 and K096 was based on the characteristicsof the waste as generated. The Agency believes that it is highly likelythat at least some portion of these ``derived-from'' K095 and K096 nonwastewatersmay contain a sufficient quantity of impurities that would render it unsuitablefor recycling. Recent information suggests that one facility may frequentlyincinerate K096, as an option to recycling, and may be generating ash residualsthat would be considered a ``derived-from'' nonwastewater residual thatmay require land disposal. The Agency believes that this ash would notresemble K096 as generated and would not be able to be recycled similarto other K096 wastes. Further, where the standard is ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation''for K029 nonwastewaters, it is obvious that if a ``derived-from'' nonwastewateris indeed generated, the basis for the applicability of the standard tothat particular waste is no longer substantiated. Since the Agency anticipates that either of these scenarios have a reasonablepotential for occurring for K029, K095 and K096 nonwastewaters, the Agencyis proposing that the ``No Land Disposal'' standards do not apply to ``derived-from''nonwastewaters. However, the Agency is specifically soliciting commenton the need for the development of treatment standards for K029, K095 andK096 ``derived-from'' nonwastewaters. The Agency must promulgate treatmentstandards for all remaining wastes by May 8, 1990, including these nonwastewaterresidues generated from the previous management of listed wastes. The Agencybelieves that numerical standards for these wastes could be developed basedon transferring performance data for organics from the incineration ofK019 or F024 wastes and transferring performance data for metals (in ash)from an appropriate metal-bearing waste.As an option to the ``No Land Disposal'' standards, as well as the optionof developing new standards for these ``derived-from'' K029, K095 and K096nonwastewaters, the Agency may propose to establish numerical standardsfor all K029, K095 and K096 ``derived-from'' nonwastewaters based on adirect transfer of the standards being proposed for K028 wastes (i.e.,the standards for all constituents proposed for K028 nonwastewaters wouldthen be applicable to K029, K095 and K096 nonwastewaters). At this time, the Agency is not proposing treatment standards for the wastewaterforms of K029, K095 or K096 (including derived-from wastewaters). The Agencyis uncertain that the nonwastewater forms of these wastes were ever previouslyland disposed. If not, then the Agency believes that there may be no needto develop such standards for ''derived-from'' K029, K095 and K096 wastewaters.The Agency will develop treatment standards prior to May 8, 1990, if thereis an identified need for such standards (i.e. if ``derived-from'' wastewaterforms of the listed waste are proven to be generated). The Agency is currentlyevaluating the possibility of transferring treatment performance data fromK028 wastewaters for these ``derived-from'' K029, K095 and K096 wastewaters.The Agency has identified several sources of metals precipitation performancedata which may be applicable to inorganic constituents. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,5.3,5.3</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>028 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1-Dichloroethane<D>0.014</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">trans-1,2-Dichloroethene <D>0.014</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorobutadiene<D>2.7</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachloroethane<D>1.8</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachloroethane<D>1.9</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,1,2-Tetrachloroethane<D>1.9</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane<D>1.9</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachloroethene<D>0.014</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,1-Trichloroethane<D>0.014</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,2-Trichloroethane<D>0.014</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (total)<D>(\1\)</D><D>1.7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel<D>(\2\)</D><D>0.048</D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F><F>\2\ Applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,5.3,8</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standard for K</T4>028 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">1,1-Dichloroethane<D>0.014</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">trans-1,2-Dichloroethene<D>0.036</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorobutadiene<D>0.014</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachloroethane<D>0.036</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachloroethane<D>0.014</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,1,2-Tetrachloroethane<D>0.014</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane<D>0.014</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachloroethene<D>0.014</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,1-Trichloroethane<D>0.014</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,2-Trichloroethane<D>0.014</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cadmium<D>6.4</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chromium (total)<D>0.35</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lead<D>0.037</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nickel<D>0.47</D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">BDAT Treatment Standard for K029</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">(Nonwastewaters)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">NO LAND DISPOSAL BASED ON NO GENERATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">BDAT Treatment Standard for K095 and K096</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">(Nonwastewaters)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">NO LAND DISPOSAL BASED ON RECYCLING</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG>i. <T3>Wastes from Phorate Production.</T3><ITAG tagnum="26">K038_Wastewater from the washing and stripping of Phorate production.(2nd) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">K039_Filter cake from the filtration of diethyl phosphorodithioicacid in the production of Phorate.

(2nd)</ITAG>1. <T3>Introduction. </T3>K038, K039 and K040 are all Second Third wastesthat are generated from the production of Phorate, an organophosphoruspesticide. Phorate is the primary constituent of concern in K038 and K040and has the technical name, phosphorodithioic acid O,O-diethyl S-[(ethylthio)methyl] ester. The primary constituent of concern in K039 is diethyl phosphorodithioicacid. The Agency has data on the incineration of K037 nonwastewaters (wastewatertreatment sludge from the production of Disulfoton) that contain the structurallysimilar organophosphorus pesticide, Disulfoton. The technical name forDisulfoton is phosphorodithioic acid O,O-diethyl S-[(ethylthio) ethyl]ester. The only structural difference between Disulfoton and Phorate isthe additional methylene (-CH<T2>2</T2>-) group in Disulfoton. This slight difference is believed tobe insignificant with respect to the ability of the two pesticides to beincinerated. Numerical treatment standards for K037 wastewaters and nonwastewaterswere promulgated with the First Third wastes on August 8, 1988, and arenot being reopened for comment here. These standards were based on theperformance of incineration of K037 nonwastewaters in a rotary kiln andthe concentrations of hazardous constituents found in the ash and scrubberwater residuals. In today's rule, the Agency is proposing to transfer thesetreatment standards to K038 and K040. More information on the Agency'sprocedures for transferring treatment standards can be found in SectionIII.A.5 of this preamble as well as in the Background Document for thesewastes.2.<T3> Development of Standards. </T3>Currently, EPA has no approved methodthat can adequately analyze diethyl phosphorodithioic acid in treatmentresidues. In addition, EPA has not identified any organic constituentsin K039 wastes that could be used as a surrogate or as an indicator compoundin order to develop numerical standards for K039 wastes. Thus, EPA is proposingincineration as a BDAT treatment methodology for nonwastewater forms ofK039. Since diethyl phosphorodithioic acid is structurally similar to Disulfotonand Phorate, EPA believes it can be effectively destroyed by incineration.While the proposed treatment standards for K038, K039 and K040 are allbased on the performance of incineration of K037 in a rotary kiln, othertreatment technologies such as fluidized bed incineration, fuel substitutionunits, biodegradation, and solvent extraction, that can achieve these standardsare not precluded from use by this rule. Analysis of the elemental composition of Phorate reveals that the compoundcontains 11.90% phosphorus and 36.94% sulfur. Depending on the concentrationof Phorate in the particular waste, emissions of the oxides of phosphorusand sulfur could be of concern during incineration. The Agency currentlybelieves that hazardous waste combustion units that are equipped with airpollution control devices should be able to effectively control these acidiccombustion products. The concentrations of Phorate and diethyl phosphorodithioicacid in K038, K039 and K040 wastes should be relatively low enough thatthe total concentration of phosphorus and sulfur in the waste will notresult in excessive emissions of the respective oxides. The Agency is currently unaware of any alternative treatment or recyclingtechnologies that have been examined specifically for these wastes andsolicits data and comments on these. For the wastewater forms of K039, EPA is proposing carbon adsorption asBDAT treatment methodology. EPA believes that diethyl phosphorodithioicacid in wastewater forms of K039 can easily be adsorbed on carbon due tothe chemical and physical properties of the compound (such as its molecularweight, elemental composition, and structural form). The spent carbon wouldbe considered by the Agency to be a nonwastewater form of K039 and wouldbe required to be incinerated, as it is a nonwastewater subject to thespecified method. EPA received no comments on the numerical treatment standards for K037when they were proposed and the Agency therefore promulgated the standardsas proposed. To date, no requests for a variance from these standards havebeen received. The Agency has data that indicates that there are very fewgenerators of K038 and K040, and in fact only one producer of K039 whoalso produces K038. Information also suggests that these wastes are nottypically land disposed. The Agency considered proposing a treatment standardof ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'' for the nonwastewater formsof K038, K039 and K040. However, the Agency prefers to establish numericalstandards whenever a transfer of standards from structurally similar compoundscan be reasonably performed. EPA has determined that incineration in a rotary kiln will achieve a levelof performance that represents the best demonstrated available treatmenttechnology (BDAT) for nonwastewater forms of K038, K039 and K040. EPA isproposing to regulate only Phorate in wastes identified as K038 and K040.The proposed BDAT treatment standards for these wastes are listed in thetables at the end of this section. Treatment standards for Phorate arebased on analysis of total constituent concentration. As previously discussed,incineration as a treatment methodology is proposed as BDAT for K039 nonwastewaters,and carbon adsorption as a treatment methodology is proposed as BDAT forK039 wastewaters.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standard for K</T4>038 <T4>and K</T4>040 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Phorate <D>0.1 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,10,r42 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>038 <T4>and K</T4>040 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Phorate <D>0.003 </D><D>(\1\) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG>  <ITAG tagnum="74">BDAT Treatment Standard for K039</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">(Nonwastewaters)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">INCINERATION AS A METHOD</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">BDAT Treatment Standard for K039</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">(Wastewaters)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">CARBON ADSORPTION AS A METHOD</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">_</ITAG><T3>j. Wastes from 2,4-D Production.</T3><ITAG tagnum="26">K043_2,6-Dichlorophenol wastes from the production of 2,4-D. (2nd)</ITAG>1. <T3>Introduction. </T3>The listed waste K043 is generated at one facilityin the U.S. during the production of 2,4-D. The waste consists of distillationbottoms from the purification of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), a precursorto 2,4-D. This waste contains high concentrations of halogenated organics(greater than 0.1%) which already subject it to restriction from land disposalfrom the California List rule for Halogenated Organic Compounds (HOCs).EPA has identified incineration as an applicable technology for this waste.The process of incineration thermally destroys (oxidizes) the organic constituentsin the waste. The Agency recognizes any technology that destroys organicsas an applicable technology for this waste. There is data that suggest that all K043 waste is currently being treatedby incineration. Characterization data for K043 waste indicates that theash concentration is two percent. Therefore, ash residues are generatedfrom the incineration process and, for the purpose of BDAT standards, areclassified as nonwastewaters. Scrubber waters are generated as part ofthe air pollution control system and are classified as wastewaters. Bothof these residues must meet the applicable BDAT treatment standards set,prior to placement in a land disposal unit (other than a no-migration unit).2. <T3>Development of Standards. </T3>The EPA has received data on incinerationof K043 waste from the sole generator. This data consists of two treatmentdata sets for scrubber water and one treatment data set for clarifier solidsgenerated from incineration of K043 waste. EPA has determined that incinerationachieves a level of performance that represents BDAT for K043 waste basedon treatment performance data. The sole generator of K043 waste uses incinerationto treat K043. Therefore, the Agency believes incineration is demonstratedto treat K043. This treatment system is judged to be available to treatK043 because (1) the treatment system is commercially available and (2)the system provides a substantial reduction in the concentration of theBDAT List organic constituents present in K043. The proposed regulated constituents for K043 and the proposed treatmentstandards for wastewaters and nonwastewaters are presented in the tableat the end of this section. The standards are expressed as total constituentconcentrations. While the Agency did not have treatment performance data for chlorinateddioxins and chlorinated dibenzofurans, it did have characterization datafrom the sole generator indicating the presence of several of these constituentsin K043 waste at very low levels. The Agency also has data on six BDATchlorinated dioxins and chlorinated dibenzofurans in untreated and treatedK099 waste. This waste is generated at the same site as K043 waste, inthe next step of the 2,4-D production process. The K099 data indicate concentrationlevels of less than l ppb for each of these six constituents in the treatedwaste. BDAT standards for these constituents were set at 1 ppb, which representsthe analytical limit of detection for these constituents that can be routinelyachieved. While K043 data for one of these constituents indicated its presenceat a concentration greater than 1 ppb in the untreated waste, the Agencybelieves that this, as well as any other chlorinated dioxins and chlorinateddibenzofurans, can be effectively treated to levels below the l ppb analyticaldetection limit using rotary kiln incineration, which the Agency has determinedto be BDAT for K043 waste. Therefore, because the Agency believes the K043waste to be sufficiently similar and treatable as K099 waste, the Agencyhas transferred the BDAT standards for the six chlorinated dioxins andchlorinated dibenzofurans regulated in K099 to K043. See Section III.A.5.of this proposed rule for a more detailed discussion related to the transferof treatment standards. Although the Agency does not have data on 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T in the K043waste from the sole generator, it does have characterization data on theseconstituents from a former generator of K043 waste. This former generatorused a different process to produce 2,4-D. The sole generator of K043 usesa two-step process to produce 2,4-D. The K043 waste is generated in thefirst step of this process following the production of 2,4-DCP, prior toproduction of 2,4-D. Therefore the Agency does not expect 2,.4-D and 2,4,5-Tto be present in the K043 waste produced by the sole generator. For potentialK043 waste produced by a different process, the Agency believes that theregulation of the proposed BDAT List constituents for K043 will ensurethat these constituents will be effectively treated.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>043 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total composition  (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-Dichlorophenol <D>0.38</D><D>(\1\)  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,6-Dichlorophenol <D>0.34</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorophenol <D>1.9</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachloroethene <D>1.7</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorophenols (Total) <D>0.68</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4,5-Trichlorophenol <D>8.2</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4,6-Trichlorophenol <D>7.6</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001</D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001</D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001</D><D>(\1\)</D><F>\1\ Not applicable. </F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,7.3,7.3 </C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for K</T4>043 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample </H1><H2>Total Composition  (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP(mg/l)</H2>  <ITAG tagnum="1">2,4-Dichlorophenol <D>0.06 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,6-Dichlorophenol <D>0.006 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorophenol <D>0.014 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachloroethene <D>0.006 </D><D>(\1\)</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorophenols (Total) <D>0.02 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4,5-Trichlorophenol <D>0.025 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,4,6-Trichlorophenol <D>0.017 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetrachlorodibenzo-furans <D>0.001 </D><D>(\1\)</D><F>\1\ Not applicable. </F></ITAG></ITAG> k.<T3> Second Third K Wastes for Which No Standards Are Proposed.</T3><ITAG tagnum="26">K041_Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of Toxaphene.(2nd) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">K042_Heavy ends or distillation residues from the distillation oftetrachlorobenzene in the production of 2,4,5-T.

(2nd)</ITAG>The Agency has not completed its evaluation of BDAT for these wastes andis not proposing treatment standards at this time. RCRA 3004(g)(6) (42USC 6924(g)(6)) provides that if EPA fails to set treatment standards forany hazardous waste included in the schedule promulgated on May 28, 1986(51 FR 19300) by the statutory deadline, such waste may be land disposedin a landfill or surface impoundment only if the facility meets certainstatutory requirements and only until May 8, 1990. These requirements havebeen termed the ``soft hammer'' provisions. Since the Agency will not promulgatestandards for K041, K042, K097, K098 and/or K105 wastes by their statutorydeadline, land disposal of these wastes shall be regulated by the ``softhammer'' provisions.In other sections of this preamble, the Agency outlines the regulatoryframework for management of these ``soft hammer'' wastes and discussesits interpretation of the terms ``treatment'', ``facility'', and ``practical''as stated in RCRA 3004(g)(6). The Agency believes that the majority of these wastes, as generated, arenonwastewaters (greater than 1.0% TOC) containing relatively high concentrationsof chlorinated organics. In addition, EPA believes that the majority ofthese wastes contain high enough concentrations of halogenated organics(greater than 0.1%), that they should already be restricted from land disposalaccording to the California List rule for Halogenated Organic Compounds(HOCs). Information available to the Agency indicate that generation of these wastesmay have ceased. However, the Agency believes that there will be a needto develop numerical treatment standards for this treatability group becauseof the probability of requiring disposal for some of the out-of-date pesticides(as defined by andSection; 261.33) and residues from previous managementof these wastes. In order to reduce the number of anticipated variancepetitions from this type of situation, EPA believes that numerical standardsare the preferred option. The strategy for the transfer of standards isalso discussed in the section discussing U and P Halogenated Organics TreatabilityGroup. 1.<T3> Toxaphene and Chlordane Wastes. </T3>The Agency has determined thatK041, K097 and K098 wastes are representatives of a treatability groupthat also includes wastes identified as D015, K032, K033, K034, P123 (Toxaphene)and U036 (Chlordane). This group of wastes contain varying concentrationsof the multiple component halogenated pesticides toxaphene and/or chlordane.The reasoning behind this grouping can be found in the discussion of MultipleComponent Halogenated Pesticides for U and P wastes. EPA may also propose treatment standards based on the transfer of performancedata from the incineration of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls). Toxapheneand Chlordane are similar to PCBs, in that they all are mixtures of manyisomers of polyhalogenated organics. Typical analytical procedures forall three of these involve pattern recognition of these multiple componentsusing GC/ECD analyses. The Agency has not completed the analysis of anyof these data, and is not proposing standards for these wastes at thistime. 2. <T3>2,4,5-T Wastes. </T3>While K042 wastes are from the production of 2,4,5-T,the listing appears to indicate that the wastes should be expected to containtetrachlorobenzene. The Agency anticipates that numerical standards canbe transferred from the development of standards for K105 (see the discussionof this waste that follows) and possibly from the development from chlorinatedphenolic wastes such as K043 or K099 (due to structural similarities of2,4,5-T with the chlorinated phenolics contained in these wastes. The Agencyquestions whether a numerical standard for nonwastewaters is even necessaryfor these wastes and is soliciting comments on the possibility of establishinga ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'' for K042 wastes. 3. <T3>Chlorobenzene Wastes. </T3>K105 wastes, along with K085 wastes (distillationor fractionation column bottoms from the production of chlorobenzenes)are both listed wastes from the production of chlorobenzenes. K085 wasoriginally scheduled for regulation with the First Third wastes. However,EPA did not propose or promulgate treatment standards for K085 wastes priorto August 8, 1988, due to the concern over the presence of greater than50 ppm of Poly-Chlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). The Office of Toxic Substances(OTS) currently requires waste containing greater than 50 ppm of PCBs tobe incinerated in a TSCA approved PCB incinerator. OTS has some PCB testburn data at a facility that was also incinerating K085. EPA intends todevelop standards for both K085 and K105 wastes based on transfer of PCBincineration performance data. PCBs were often mixed with a mix of tri- and tetra-chlorobenzenes to formthe mixtures that were used as PCB transformer fluids (Askarels). EPA anticipatesproposing numerical treatment standards for the chlorobenzene constituentsin K085 and K105 wastes as well as all chlorobenzene wastes based on directtransfer of incineration efficiencies for the chlorobenzenes containedin the PCB wastes. This information is currently considered TSCA confidentialbusiness information (CBI) and appropriate TSCA clearance procedures mustbe followed prior to use for matters involving only RCRA authority. Sincethese data will not be available in time for proposal of K085 or K105 withthe Second Third wastes, land disposal of K085 wastes (as promulgated withthe First Third wastes) shall continue to be regulated under the ``softhammer'' provisions and K105 wastes will also be subject to these provisions.If these data remains CBI, the Agency may not have sufficient time to developa treatment standard for these wastes prior to May 8, 1990. The statutoryrequirements of RCRA referred to as the ``hard hammer'' will then restrictthe waste from land disposal. However, if performance data on the incinerationof K085 and other PCBs are submitted in response to this proposal as publicinformation, there may be sufficient time to develop treatment standardsprior to May 8, 1990. However, as an alternative, EPA may decide to allowthe statutory provisions of the ``hard hammer'' to take effect, because1986 data indicate that these wastes may no longer be land disposed. Thesedata appear to conflict with the data submitted by the facility incineratingK085, since ash generated from incineration of K085, which remains K085under the derived from rule, would be expected to require land disposal.Other Organophosphorus Wastes.<ITAG tagnum="26">K036_Still bottoms from toluene reclamation distillation in the productionof Disulfoton (lst)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P039_Disulfoton (lst)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P040_Diethyl 2_pyrazinyl phosphorothioate (2nd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P041_Diethyl-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (lst)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P043_Diisopropylfluorophosphate (2nd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P044_Dimethoate (2nd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P062_Hexaethyl tetraphosphate (2nd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P071_Methyl parathion (lst)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P085_Octamethyl pyrophosphoramide (2nd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P089_Parathion (lst)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P094_Phorate (lst)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P097 Famphur (lst)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P109_Tetraethyl dithiopyrophosphate (3rd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">P111_Tetraethyl pyrophosphate (2nd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">U058_Cyclophosphamide (2nd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">U087_O,O-Diethyl S-methyl dithiophosphate (3rd)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">U235_tris-(2,3-Dibromopropyl) phosphate (2nd)</ITAG>1. <T3>Introduction</T3>. EPA has grouped K036, P039, P040, P041, P043, P044,P062, P071, P085, P089, P094, P097, P109, P111, U058, U087 and U235 wastestogether due to similarities in structure and elemental content of theprimary constituent of concern in each waste. All of the chemicals representedby these waste codes are organophosphorus compounds.EPA has divided the U and P wastes into two groups. The first group includesP039, P071, P089, P094, P097 and U235. The Agency has determined that theorganophosphorus chemicals represented by these codes are structurallysimilar to the organophosphorus pesticide, Disulfoton. Therefore, the Agencyis proposing to directly transfer numerical standards from the incinerationof K037 wastes (wastewater treatment sludge from the production of Disulfoton)to each of the individual U and P chemicals. Treatment standards for K037wastewaters and nonwastewaters were promulgated on August 8, 1988. Moreinformation on the Agency's procedures for transferring treatment standardscan be found in Section III.A.5 of this preamble as well as in the BackgroundDocument for these wastes.<T3>2. Development of Standards</T3>_a. <T3>Standards for P039, P071, P089, P094, P097 and U235.</T3> The transferof treatment standards for Disulfoton from K037 is particularly appropriatefor P039 (Disulfoton) and for P094 (Phorate). The only structural differencebetween Phorate and Disulfoton is the additional methylene (-CH<T2>2</T2>-) group in Disulfoton. This slight difference is believed tobe insignificant with respect to the ability of the two pesticides to beincinerated. EPA thus believes the structural similarity is sufficientto support the transfer of standards. In addition, the Agency believesthat Disulfoton is one of the most difficult organophosphorus chemicalsin this entire group of organophorus compounds to incinerate. Given thatDisulfoton can be effectively treated by incineration and that the chemicalsin this group are structurally similar, the Agency believes that all theother wastes in this section can be effectively treated by incineration.Therefore, the Agency believes that the performance achievable by incinerationrepresents BDAT for all of the above wastes and is proposing to transferthese standards to P039, P071, P089, P094, P097 and U235.While the Agency believes that the K037 standards can be transferred tothese wastes, it understands that a particular U or P waste may not containthe same constituents or concentration of the specific U or P chemicalthat were in the K037 waste that EPA incinerated. EPA also understandsthat the composition of U and P wastes can vary significantly. However,given the statutory time constraints that exist, the Agency cannot possiblytest every single U and P chemical, nor can it be expected to account forthis variability in waste characteristics. The Agency is therefore solicitingspecific data on treatment of these wastes. The Agency also believes thatthe transfer of standards is the best alternative for these organophosphoruswastes.<T3>b. Standards for P040, P041, P043, P044, P062, P085, P109, P111, U058and U087. </T3>As with the first group of wastes, the Agency believes thatincineration represents BDAT for these wastes. However, the Agency doesnot believe that numerical treatment standards can be established for thesechemicals at this time. The major problem in establishing numerical standardsfor these chemicals is that EPA does Not currently have an analytical methodthat can analyze these chemicals in these treatment residues. In addition,EPA has not identified any organic constituents in these wastes that couldbe used as a surrogate or as an indicator compound in order to developnumerical standards for these wastes. The Agency recognizes that theremay be methods that may be used for the concentrated chemicals to verifypurity and determine product specifications. However, there are often noanalytical procedures for the measurement of trace quantities of thesechemicals either in environmental samples or in residues from treatment.As a result, a numerical treatment standard for these constituents is apparentlynot feasible. While there does not appear to be an approved method thatis capable of detecting these compounds in incinerator ash, the Agencyis investigating methods used by other EPA offices which may detect thesecompounds on food or in water. Since Section 3004(m) allows the Agencyto establish either levels or methods of treatment, the Agency is proposingincineration as a method of treatment for this second group of U and Pwastes. It is also important to point out that EPA requires that an incineratorburning any RCRA hazardous waste must meet the requirements specified in40 CFR Part 264 Subpart O or Part 265 Subpart O.P041, P043, P044 and P111 hydrolyze (break down quickly) in water makingthem difficult to analyze in wastewater forms of these wastes. Even thoughthese compounds hydrolyze readily in water, the Agency lacks data on theeffects of the hydrolysis products on the environment and does not havean approved analytical method to measure those products. Therefore, theAgency is not proposing hydrolysis as a method of treatment for these wastes.P062, U058, and P085 can only be analyzed by HPLC (High Pressure LiquidChromatography). When compounds cannot be analyzed by GC, EPA is reluctantto transfer standards based on GC analysis unless practical equivalencycan be demonstrated. In addition, since reference analytical compoundsdo not appear to be available for the chemicals represented by P040, P109and U087, the Agency anticipates that problems with compliance and enforcementwould preclude numerical standards from being proposed at this time.As concentrated off-spec chemicals, most of the U and P wastes are toxicpesticides and contain relatively high levels of phosphorous and/or sulfur.Therefore, combustion units used for treating these wastes must be equippedwith air pollution control devices that will control the combustion productsof phosphorus and sulfur. Additionally, U058 (cyclophosphamide) and U235(tris-[2,3-dibromopropyl] phosphate) are halogenated organic compounds.The elemental chlorine content of U058 is 27%, and the elemental brominecontent of U235 is 69%. If concentrated, these wastes would be subjectto the California list restrictions. Carbon adsorption as a method of treatment for the wastewater forms ofthis second group of organophosphorus wastes is proposed as BDAT. The Agencybelieves that the wastewater forms of these wastes can easily be adsorbeddue to the branched and ionic nature of their structures. After the adsorption,and before disposal, the carbon must be incinerated, and the standardsfor the nonwastewaters must be met.  The Agency believes that incineration and carbon adsorption are availablebecause: (1) These technologies are commercially available or can be purchasedfrom a proprietor and (2) these technologies achieve substantial reductionand removal of organic hazardous constituents in wastes judged to be moredifficult to treat than those organics represented by these U and P chemicals.Many of the U and P wastes can exist as concentrated off-spec chemicals.Depending on other constituents present, these forms of the wastes couldpotentially be dissolved in a suitable waste solvent and incinerated ina liquid injection system. However, EPA believes that in order to reducethe risk associated with dissolving these highly toxic chemicals, incinerationin a rotary kiln may be a preferred choice of incineration unit (althoughthis proposed rule allows any method of incineration). EPA is not precludingthe dissolution of these chemicals. In cases where there is a significantvolume of these chemicals, dissolution in a solvent may be necessary toreduce the emission of phosphorus and sulfur oxides or to increase theheat content (BTUs) of the waste in general. Due to the toxicity of thesewastes, and the likelihood of phosphorus and sulfur oxide emissions, EPAis specifically requesting comment on the applicability of these wastesfor fuel substitution. The Agency is currently unaware of any alternative treatment or recyclingtechnologies that have been examined specifically for these wastes andsolicits data and comments on these. In addition, because highly specializedrecovery systems geared to the recovery of the specific pesticide wouldprobably be required, it is unlikely that the Agency would consider proposinga treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Based on Recycling''. The proposedrule, in any case, does not preclude recycling (provided the recyclingdoes not involve burning as fuel or use constituting disposal; see andSection;261.33). <T3>c. Standard for K036 wastewaters.</T3> On August 8, 1988, a treatmentstandard of ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'' was promulgatedfor nonwastewater forms of K036. While the same treatment standard wasoriginally proposed for wastewater forms of K036, it was not promulgatedbecause the Agency determined that K036 wastewaters could be generatedas leachate from previously land disposed K036 (i.e., the basis of thestandard, ``no generation'' of wastewaters, was not valid). Land disposalof K036 wastewaters is thus currently regulated under the ``soft hammer''provisions. Although today's rule proposes standards for these wastewatersbased on a direct transfer of numerical treatment standards from K037 wastewaters,the Agency is not reopening the comment period for the promulgated treatmentstandards for K036 nonwastewaters. The Agency has established varianceprocedures for those facilities that must land dispose these wastes andcannot meet the promulgated treatment standards. These procedures are outlinedin other sections of today's rule.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,10,10</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for </T4>K036 <ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent </H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total Composition (mg/l) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Disulfoton <D>0.003 </D><D>( \1\ ) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,10,10</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for U and P Organophosphorus Wastes </T4>P039,P071, P089, P094, P097 <T4>and </T4>U235 <T4>Respectively</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Disulfoton (P039) <D>0.1 </D><D>( \1\ )</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methyl parathion (P071) <D>0.1 </D><D>( \1\ )</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Parathion (P089) <D>0.1 </D><D>( \1\ )</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phorate (P094) <D>0.1 </D><D>( \1\ )</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Famphur (P097) <D>0.1 </D><D>( \1\ )</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">tris-(2,3-Dibromopropyl) phosphate (U235) <D>0.1 </D><D>( \1\ ) </D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,10,10</C><T4> BDAT Treatment Standards for U and P Organophosphorus Wastes </T4>P039,P071, P089, P094, P097 <T4>and </T4>U235 <T4>Respectively </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters] </ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg)</H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Disulfoton (P039) <D>0.003 </D><D>( \1\ )</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methyl parathion (P071) <D>0.003 </D><D>( \1\ )</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Parathion (P089) <D>0.003 </D><D>( \1\ )</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phorate (P094) <D>0.003 </D><D>( \1\ )</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Famphur (P097) <D>0.003 </D><D>( \1\ )</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">tris-(2,3-Dibromopropyl) phosphate (U235) <D>0.003 </D><D>( \1\ )</D><F>\1\ Not applicable.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(0),i1,s50</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for U and P Organophosphorus Wastes </T4>P040,P041, P043, P044, P062, P085, P109, P111, U058 <T4>and </T4>U087<ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="21">INCINERATION AS A METHOD</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(0),i1,s50</C><T4>BDAT Treatment Standards for U and P Organophosphorus Wastes </T4>P040,P041, P043, P044, P062, P085, P109, P111, U058 <T4>and </T4>U087<ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastewaters]</ITAG><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="21">CARBON ADSORPTION AS A METHOD</ITAG></ITAG>m.

These standards were basedon the performance of incineration of K024 nonwastewaters in a rotary kilnand the concentrations of hazardous constituents found in the ash and scrubberwater residuals. In today's rule, the Agency is proposing to transfer thesetreatment standards to U028, U069, U088, U102, U107 and U190. Except for U190 (i.e., phthalic anhydride; which forms phthalic acid bya simple reaction with water) all of these U and P wastes are esters ofphthalic acid. These esters are commonly referred to as phthalates. Thedifference between these compounds is merely the number of methylene (-CH<T2>2</T2>-) hydrocarbon groups on each ester group (i.e., diethyl phthalatehas one more methylene on each ester group than dimethyl phthalate). EPAbelieves that these structural similarities, coupled with the fact thatall of these compounds are anticipated to be easier to burn than phthalicacid, are sufficient evidence to support the transfer of the performancedata for phthalic acid (from K024) to these individual U and P phthalates.Therefore, the Agency intends to propose treatment standards for each individualcompound based on these data. These U and P wastes are grouped as ``phthalates'' in order to solicitspecific comments from manufacturers and users of phthalates regardingstandards for these wastes. Several petitions have been submitted to EPAto remove certain phthalates from TSCA and SARA lists of hazardous materials.In addition, analyses for these constituents are often complicated by thehigh probability of cross-contamination by these constituents in the laboratory.They are common contaminants in plastics (such as plastic gloves used duringthe analyses) due to their presence as plasticizers.While the proposed treatment standards for these U and P phthalate wastesare based on the performance of incineration of K024 in a rotary kiln,other treatment technologies such as fluidized bed incineration, fuel substitutionunits, biodegradation, and solvent extraction, that can achieve these standardsare not precluded from use by this rule. Since all of these compounds consistonly of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, it is highly likely that these wastescould go to fuel substitution or to cement kilns as alternatives to incineration.The Agency is currently unaware of any alternative treatment or recyclingtechnologies that have been examined specifically for these wastes andsolicits data and comments on these. EPA received no comments on the numerical treatment standards for K024.To date, no requests for a variance from these standards have been received.The Agency has data that indicate that there are relatively few generatorsof these U and P phthalate wastes. Information also suggests that mostof these wastes are not typically land disposed. The Agency consideredproposing a treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation''for the nonwastewater forms of those wastes that were not land disposedin 1986. However, the Agency prefers to establish numerical standards whenevera transfer of standards can be reasonably performed. EPA has determined that incineration in a rotary kiln will achieve a levelof performance that represents the best demonstrated available treatmenttechnology (BDAT) for nonwastewater forms of the U and P phthalate wastes.EPA promulgated treatment standards for K024 wastes based on analysis forphthalic acid and is proposing the same standards for wastes identifiedas K023, K093, and K094. While phthalic anhydride is the primary hazardousconstituent in K023, K024, K093, and K094, it is readily hydrolyzed bywater to phthalic acid. Thus, phthalic anhydride cannot be easily analyzed.However, there is an analytical method for phthalic acid. Thus, the treatmentstandards for K023, K024, K093, and K094 wastewaters and nonwastewatersare based on analyses for phthalic acid. This constituent, although notlisted as a hazardous constituent in Part 261 Appendix VIII, was chosenas a surrogate compound for phthalic anhydride. EPA is also proposing thesame BDAT treatment standards for wastes identified as U190, phthalic anhydride.The proposed standards for the other U and P phthalate wastes, are listedin the tables at the end of this section and are derived from a directtransfer of the numerical value for phthalic acid to the respective phthalateester. The Agency believes that the relatively high numerical values foreach individual phthalate will account for potential contamination problems(as previously discussed) that are anticipated from handling wastes thatcontain very high concentrations of these phthalates (i.e., the U and Pwastes). All standards are based on analysis of total constituent concentration.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>BDAT Treatment Standard for U and P Phthalates </T4>U028, U069, U088,U102, U107 <T4>and </T4>U190 <T4>Respectively</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Nonwastewaters]</ITAG><H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Maximum for any single grab sample</H1><H2>Total composition (mg/kg) </H2><H2>TCLP (mg/l)</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (U028) <D>28 </D><D>( \1\ )</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Di-n-butyl phthalate (U069) <D>28 </D><D>( \1\ )</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Diethyl phthalate (U088) <D>28 </D><D>( \1\ ) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dimethyl phthalate (U102) <D>28 </D><D>( \1\ )</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Di-n-octyl phthalate (U107) <D>28 </D><D>( \1\ )</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phthalic anhydride (U190) . . .

EPA's Strategy for Transferring Standards for All Remaining U andP Wastes</ITAG>This section of today's preamble presents a discussion of the approachesand options that the Agency is considering for establishing BDAT treatmentstandards for all of the remaining ``U'' and ``P'' wastes that have notbeen proposed to date or are proposed in other sections of today's preamble.This discussion is intended to give advance notice to the regulated communityand to provide an opportunity to comment on these approaches and to submitdata that may help in developing such standards. At this time, the Agencyis not proposing treatment standards for any of the wastes listed in thissection. Please identify comments on this material with the heading ``Commentson EPA's approach to remaining wastes''. The Agency is specifically soliciting comments on the approach to developingtreatment standards for each of the individual wastes or treatability groups.Comments and data on specific treatment technologies for specific wastesor subcategories should include a description of the generation processor processes, complete chemical and physical analyses of the wastes andtreatment residuals (including all appropriate QA/QC information), as wellas technical descriptions of the treatment technologies including designand operating conditions.<T3>a. Background and General Issues</T3>. Today's rule addresses severalproblems pertinent to the development of numerical treatment standardsfor ``U'' and ``P'' wastes [as defined in 40 CFR Section 261.33(e) and(f)]. In this section, the Agency presents options to resolve these problems.Other issues such as deficiencies in waste characterization, analyticalcomplications, sporadic generation patterns, infrequent land disposal,potential necessity for dissolution prior to treatment, and difficultiesin evaluation of recycling potential, are also presented.The Agency believes that numerical treatment standards can be developedfor the majority of ``U'' and ``P'' wastes based on existing data. EPAhas grouped all of the ``U'' and ``P'' wastes into various treatabilitygroups based on similarities in elemental composition (e.g., carbon, halogensand metals) and the presence of key functional groups (e.g., phenolics,esters, and amines) within the structure of the individual U or P chemical.In development of these treatability groups, the Agency also accountedfor physical and chemical factors that are known to effect the selectionof treatment alternatives and to effect the performance of the treatment,such as volatility and solubility. The use of the chemical (e.g. pesticidesand pharmaceuticals) was also important in establishing these groups. Byemphasizing the use of these chemicals, it allows the Agency to identifyissues specific on these groups of chemicals, to target potential sourcesof data, and to solicit comments and data from specific industries andpublic interest groups.<T3>1. Waste Characterization</T3>. Let us first examine the characteristicsand nature of these wastes. EPA has designated a specific U or P wastecode number referring to the specific chemical constituent associated withthat code. EPA's listing sorts these wastes into two general hazard categories.Those wastes identified as P wastes are defined as ``acute hazardous''wastes and those wastes identified as U wastes are defined as ``toxic''wastes. The Agency has determined that these distinctions generally haveno bearing on treatability nor do they contribute to the development ofthe treatability groups identified in this section. As listed, these wastes are typically commercial products, off-specificationspecies, container residues, or spill residues. These wastes can also existas wastewater or nonwastewater treatment residues based on the derived-fromor mixture rules. In addition, they are often identified as contents oflab packs. Within these lab packs, they have been identified as variouscomplex mixtures of discarded concentrated chemicals, contaminated laboratorysamples, old analytical laboratory standards and contaminated equipment.EPA understands that the composition of these wastes can vary significantly.It recognizes that some U and P wastes may not contain the same constituentsor concentration of the specific U or P chemical that was present in thewaste from which numerical standards may be proposed to be transferred.However, given the statutory time constraints that exist, the Agency cannotpossibly test every single U and P chemical nor can it expect to accountfor the anticipated variability in waste characteristics. The Agency believesthat the transfer of data and development of numerical standards is thebest alternative for these U and P wastes, with treatment variances availablefor exceptional cases, such as for wastes identified as contaminated soiland debris. In order to comply with the land disposal restrictions requirements ofHSWA, the Agency is considering proposing a method of treatment as opposedto a numerical treatment standard for wastes identified as contaminatedequipment or debris. A detailed discussion regarding our rationale to specifya treatment technology is presented in the following section. <T3>2. Analytical Complications</T3>. One significant problem with settingstandards for U and P wastes is that for many, EPA does not have an analyticalmethod that is approved by the Office of Solid Waste. For others, thereare apparently no analytical methods that are known to exist. The Agencyrecognizes (that these compounds do exist and that there are methods thatmay be used for the concentrated chemicals to verify purity and determiningproduct specifications. However, there are often no analytical proceduresfor the measurement of trace quantities of these chemicals either in environmentalsamples or in residues from treatment. As a result, a numerical treatmentstandard for some of these constituents is apparently not feasible. In addition, many of these chemicals either react or degrade with wateror leaching solutions, preventing the direct measurement of the U or Pconstituent in treatment residues. Whenever possible, EPA considered thepossibility of using the reaction products or degradation products to developnumerical standards for these wastes (e.g. cyanide for sodium cyanide andlead for lead phosphate). However, in some instances, there are apparentlyno ``indicator'' compounds that can be measured. An example of this problemis U223, toluene diisocyanate (TDI). Currently, EPA has no standard methodto characterize TDI. TDI is a constituent that polymerizes very easilyand hydrolyzes to become a toluene diamine (TDA) when reacted with water.Unfortunately, the Agency is unable to use TDA as an indicator of TDI presence,since EPA also lacks an approved standard method for TDA. The Agency, however,is currently examining available methods that would enable the characterizationof TDI or identification of another indicator. If EPA is unable to developa standard method or identify an indicator for TDI (U223), there will notbe a way of verifying the performance of treatment based on analysis oftreatment residues for TDI. Therefore, a numerical treatment standard forU223 may not be technically feasible. The Agency solicits information aboutanalytical methods currently used by manufacturers and formulators forthose U and P chemicals that EPA has no SW846 analytical methods.<T3>3. Current Generation and Land Disposal Practices</T3>. The Agencyhas data that indicates that for some U and P wastes there may be relativelyfew generators. Information from the 1986 TSDR survey also suggests thatsome of these U and P wastes are not typically land disposed. The Agencyconsidered proposing a treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Based onNo Generation'' for these. However, the Agency prefers to establish numericalstandards whenever a transfer of standards can be reasonably performed.This approach is particularly important for U and P wastes for severalreasons. In particular, the sporadic nature of generation suggests thatthese wastes may be generated at any time and thus may require land disposalof treatment residues. While establishing a treatment standard of ``NoLand Disposal Based on No Generation'', does provide an alternative ofa petition for a variance to generators (see section III.A.6.), the Agencybelieves that there is a higher probability that a specific U or P wastemay be sporadically generated rather than some of the F or K wastes forwhich the standard was originally developed. However, the Agency does believethat for some U and P wastes that have a very low probability of generation,this alternative may be feasible. 4. <T3>Dissolution for Treatment.</T3> Some of the discarded or off-specificationU and P chemicals, when existing as concentrated chemicals or mixtures,in some circumstances, may be dissolved in a suitable solvent prior totreatment. Concentrated organic liquids and solids could be dissolved inan appropriate organic solvent (or waste solvent) and then incineratedin a liquid injection system. Concentrated inorganic chemicals and metalsalts could be dissolved in water or acidic media and then be chemicallyoxidized or reduced, and precipitated as an insoluble salt.EPA believes that to reduce the risk associated with dissolving these highlytoxic chemicals, incineration of low volumes of these concentrated organicchemicals in a rotary kiln may be preferred. In addition, EPA is concernedabout potential increases in waste volume due to this practice. However,EPA is not precluding the dissolution of these chemicals where this dissolutionis environmentally the best practice. In cases where there is a significantvolume of these chemicals, dissolution in a solvent may be necessary inorder to reduce the acidic emission of halides or oxides of phosphorus,nitrogen, or sulfur. The dissolution may also be necessary to increasethe heat content of the waste. 5. <T3>Recycling Potential.</T3> The Agency believes that recycling for someof the U and P wastes may be feasible. For example, an off-spec productcan undergo further on-site processing rather than land disposal, can besold as a low grade chemical product in the market, or can be exchangedas a raw material to other industries participating in a hazardous wasteexchange program. Other U and P wastes may require further treatment priorto recycling (e.g., U and P wastes that tend to polymerize or solidifymay need to be fluidized prior to reuse). Certain U and P wastes may notbe amenable to recycling for a variety of reasons. The Agency solicitsdata and information to identify those U and P wastes amenable to recycling.EPA does not intend to preclude the recycling of any of these wastes.<T3>b. Halogenated Organics Treatability Groups.</T3> Many of the U andP wastes fall under a general treatability group of Halogenated Organics.Within this general group are six different individual treatability groupsbased primarily on similarities in their structure, their industrial useor generation, and the presence of certain functional groups. Various issuesassociated with each treatability group are discussed below. The U andP chemicals are grouped into chlorinated aliphatics, chlorinated phenols,single component halogenated pesticides, multiple component halogenatedpesticides, chlorobenzene wastes, and miscellaneous halogenated organicwastes, which are presented in Table l through Table 6.For the chlorinated aliphatics treatability group, EPA anticipates transferringperformance data from the rotary kiln incineration of K019 or F024 wastesto these chemicals. The Agency believes that, since F024 wastes are specificallywastes from the production of chlorinated aliphatics and K019 containedhigh concentrations of many of the specific U and P chlorinated aliphatics,this transfer is justified.The solubility of chlorinated phenols, which will affect wastewater treatment,depends heavily on the pH. Data available from the incineration of K043wastes (from the production of 2,4-D) show the effectiveness of incinerationfor various halogenated phenolics. The Agency anticipates extrapolatingdata from K043 wastes to the other phenols. Some of the single component halogenated pesticides listed in table 3 areno longer marketed or are banned from use. The Agency will analyze dataavailable to the Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances on the generationand treatment of these wastes. The multiple component halogenated pesticide wastes are generally restrictedand are produced for use outside of the United States. Treatment standardsfor wastes from the production of these multiple component halogenatedpesticides are discussed elsewhere in this preamble. Treatment standardsfor P123 and U036 are expected to be similar to those promulgated for thosewastes.The Agency anticipates extrapolating performance data from incinerationof PCB wastes to all chlorobenzenes. The PCBs burned in this test reflectthe mixture of tri- and tetra-chlorobenzenes used in transformers (Askarels).Further discussion of the transfer of this data can be found elsewherein this preamble. For the miscellaneous halogenated organic wastes, the Agency expects totransfer data from ethylene dibromide, due to its low heat of combustion.Because there is no other correlation which can be used for this broadcategory of wastes, the Agency believes that basing the treatment standardon one of the most difficult to incinerate wastes represents the best option.Halogens or hydrogen halides can be expected to be emitted from hazardouswaste incinerators, but can be controlled by the use of scrubbers and otherair pollution control equipment.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 1._Chlorinated

Combustible U and P Waste Treatability Groups.</T3> BDAT standardsfor these wastes are anticipated to be based on incineration data availableto the Agency. Since these wastes have very high BTU values, they mightbe expected to be well suited for fuel substitution purposes. However,despite the fact that these compounds consist only of hydrogen and carbonand have a high heating value, some of these wastes may be unacceptablefor fuel substitution due to their relatively high toxicity. Data from the incineration of K024 (Distillation bottoms from the productionof phthalic anhydride from naphthalene) is anticipated to be extrapolatedto each individual polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon. The structural similaritiesbetween these polynuclear aromatics are believed to be sufficient to supportthe transfer of these standards (i.e., they are hydrocarbons generallyconsisting of fused benzene rings). Detection limits for those compoundsthat have standard analytical methods will be checked against the datafor K024 wastewaters and nonwastewaters. Information suggests that themajority of these waste codes are not typically land disposed and may notbe generated. One option open to the Agency for these codes is ``No LandDisposal based on No Generation''. However, since U and P wastes are generatedsporadically, the Agency prefers to determine numerical standards whenevera reasonable transfer of performance data can be supported. It is doubtful that recycling is available for these wastes. Highly specializedrecovery systems, geared to recovery of a specific compound, would probablybe required. Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons are grouped together tosolicit specific comments regarding their toxicity and its relation tothe standards for these wastes. Standards for these wastes are anticipatedto be complicated by the fact that these compounds are generally more toxicthan most hazardous chemicals. In fact, some are listed as Class A carcinogens.In addition, analyses for these constituents are complicated by the possibilitythat these compounds are generated during the combustion process as productsof incomplete combustion. Other hazardous and nonhazardous wastes may actuallycontribute to the formation of these constituents. Therefore, it may bedifficult to establish BDAT standards for these compounds which may begenerated during the incineration process.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,4,4),p0,7/8,i1,s25,xs25</C><T4>Table 7._Aromatic and Polycyclic Hydrocarbon Wastes</T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">U005_2-Acetylaminofluorene <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U016_Benz(c)acridine <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U018_Benz(a)anthracene <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U019_Benzene <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U022_Benzo(a)pyrene <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U050_Chrysene <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U055_Cumene (isopropylbenzene) <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U056_Cyclohexane <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U063_Dibenzo(a,h)anthracene <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U064_1,2:7,8 Dibenzopyrene <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U094_7,12-Dimethyl benz[a]anthracene <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U120_Fluoranthene <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U137_Indeno(1,2,3-c,d)pyrene <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U157_3-Methylcholanthrene <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U165_Naphthalene <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U220_Toluene (methyl benzene) <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U239_Xylenes (dimethyl benzenes) <D>(2nd)</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,4,4),p0,7/8,i1,s25,xs25</C><T4>Table 8._Oxygenated Hydrocarbon Wastes</T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">U001_Acetaldehyde <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U002_Acetone <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U004_Acetophenone <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U031_n-Butanol <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U051_Creosote <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U052_Cresols <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U057_Cyclohexanone <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U085_1,2:3,4-Diepoxybutane <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U101_2,4-Dimethylphenol <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U108_1,4-Dioxane <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U112_Ethyl acetate <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U117_Ethyl ether <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U122_Formaldehyde <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U123_Formic acid <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U124_Furan <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U125_Furfural <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U126_Glycidaldehyde <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U140_lsobutanol <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U147_Maleic anhydride <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U154_Methanol <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U159_Methyl ethyl ketone <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U160_Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U161_Methyl isobutyl ketone <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U166_1,4-Naphthoquinone <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U182_Paraldehyde <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U188_Phenol <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U197_p-Benzoquinone <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U201_Resourcinol <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U213_Tetrahydrofuran <D>(2nd)</D></ITAG></ITAG><T3>d. </T3><T3>Organo-Nitrogen and Organo-Sulfur Treatability Groups.</T3> This groupof wastes includes the nonhalogenated pesticides, nitro-organics, amines,nitriles and other organics, and the organo-sulfur wastes. The Agency iscurrently investigating rotary kiln incineration as treatment for thesewastes. The Agency is concerned, however, with nitrogen and sulfur emissionsgenerated from the incineration of these wastes.One significant problem with setting standards for the pesticide wastesis that EPA does not have an analytical method that is approved by theOffice of Solid Waste. The Agency recognizes that these compounds do existand that there may be methods that may be used for the concentrated chemicalsto verify purity and determine product specifications. However, there areoften no analytical procedures for the measurement of trace quantitiesof these chemicals either in environmental samples or in residues fromtreatment. The organo-sulfur and organo-nitrogen wastes are not easilyanalyzed by gas chromatographic (GC) methods, because the compounds arepolar, highly branched, and have high molecular weights. They tend to stickon most columns, although special columns may be suitable. They may alsothermally decompose in the GC. This may necessitate specifying a methodof treatment rather than determining numerical standards for these wastes.These wastes are grouped here to solicit comment and data on their generationand

These wastes pose a significantrisk during handling due to their reactivity. This is reflected by thefact that there are no standard EPA methods for testing for reactivity.Because of the difficulties in handling and analyzing these wastes, theAgency may only propose a testing strategy with the Third Third and solicitdata and comment. Specific discussion of the proposed strategy can be foundin the section on Characteristic Wastes under D003 Reactive Wastes. Removingof the property of reactivity (deactivation) seems to be an applicabletreatment for these wastes. Another option for the treatment of these wastesis incineration in a rotary kiln. The Agency believes that these wastescan be effectively treated by deactivation; however additional data isnecessary to complete a full characterization of these wastes in termsof generation, waste characteristics, and current treatment and disposalpractices.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 15<T4>._Polymeric Wastes</T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">P003_Acrolein <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P005_Allyl alcohol <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P054_Ethyleneimine (Aziridine) <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P067_2-Methylaziridine <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P102_Propargyl alcohol <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U007_Acrylamide <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U008_Acrylic acid <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U009_Acrylonitrile <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U053_Crotonaldehyde <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U113_Ethyl acrylate <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U118_Ethyl methacrylate <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U152_Methacrylonitrile <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U162_Methyl methacrylate <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U186_1,3-Pentadiene <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U221_Toluenediamine <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U223_Toluene diisocyanate <D>(1st)</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,4,4),p0,7/8,i1,s25,xs25</C><T4>Table</T4> 16<T4>._Explosive or Highly Reactive Wastes</T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">P006_Aluminum phosphide <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P009_Ammonium picrate <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P015_Beryllium dust <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P068_Methyl hydrazine <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P073_Nickel carbonyl <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P081_Nitroglycerin <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P087_Osmium tetroxide <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P105_Sodium azide <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P107_Strontium sulfide <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P112_Tetranitromethane <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P122_Zinc phosphide (andgreater;10%) <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U023_Benzotrichloride <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U086_N,N-Diethylhydrazine <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U096_a,a-Dimethyl benzyl hydroperoxide <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U098_1,1-Dimethylhydrazine <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U099_1,2-Dimethylhydrazine <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U103_Dimethyl sulfate <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U109_1,2-Diphenylhydrazine <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U133_Hydrazine <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U189_Phosphorus sulfide <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U249_Zinc phosphide (andless;10%) <D>(1st)</D></ITAG></ITAG> g. <T3>Gaseous Waste Treatability Group.</T3>  While many of these gases arehighly toxic, it is unlikely that they will exist as wastes which requireland disposal. The wastes listed below are typically found as gaseous materialswhen existing at high concentrations. Since it is difficult to ``spill''a gas on soil or in water, it is unlikely that these wastes could existas spill residues. While these compounds may exist as aqueous or organicsolutions, the solutions may not be considered the listed product. Theoriginal listing specifically excluded chemical products that simply containedU or P constituents. However, EPA is concerned about the possibility thatfull containers of these wastes may have to be disposed of in a cleanupsituation. EPA solicits comments from anyone who feels they may be landdisposing these wastes or may have to do so in the future. Information suggests that the majority of these waste codes are not typicallyland disposed and may not even be generated. The treatment standard of``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'' appears to be the best alternativefor these wastes. The Agency has not yet identified any treatment technologyfor these wastes. They are grouped as ``gases'' in order to solicit commentsspecific to gases. Numerical standards for these wastes would be complicated by the fact thatthese compounds are gases. While some analytical techniques do exist, thefact that they are gases complicates the analysis of treatment residuals.The sampling and analysis procedures for these constituents would haveto minimize potential losses. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,4,4),p0,7/8,i1,s25,xs25</C><T4>Table</T4> 17<T4>._Gaseous Treatability Group</T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">P056_Fluorine <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P076_Nitric oxide <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P078_Nitrogen dioxide <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P095_Phosgene <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P096_Phosphine <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U029_Methyl bromide <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U033_Carbonyl fluoride <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U043_Vinyl chloride <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U045_Chloromethane <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U075_Dichlorodifluoromethane <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U115_Ethylene oxide <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U121_Fluorotrichloromethane <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U134_Hydrofluoric acid <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U135_Hydrogen sulfide <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U153_Methanethiol <D>(3rd)</D></ITAG></ITAG> <T3>h. Metal Waste Treatability Group.</T3> This treatability group includeswastes containing metallic compounds. These compounds include metallicsalts, organometallics, and bimetallic compounds. Analytical methods generally measure only the toxic metal, and do not determinewhich compound the metal is in. For example, given a mixture of chromiumnitrate and chromium sulfate, the method will measure chromium but notdetermine whether it is in the sulfate or nitrate form. Therefore, theAgency cannot promulgate treatment standards for the specific compoundlisted. The Agency intends to propose treatment standards as concentrationsof the specific metal in the waste, either as a total constituent analysisor as concentration in the waste extract. The Agency believes that by regulatingthe metal, the hazards associated with these compounds will be controlled.For example, the Agency believes that by regulating total chromium in U032,calcium chromate, the hazards associated with that waste will be regulated.Note that in the case of P114, Thallium Selenite, treatment standards forboth total thallium and total selenium would be necessary for regulatingits concentration. There will be specific codes which require other considerations,such as P065, mercury fulminate, which also exhibits the characteristicof reactivity. These issues will be dealt with on a code specific basis.The Agency requests comment on the appropriateness of regulating only thetoxic metal constituents in these wastes. The Agency has several regulatory options for these wastes. Performancedata is available from treatment of various F and K wastes, which containedthese metals. The Agency intends to investigate the appropriateness oftransferring this performance data to these wastes. Another option forthese U andamp; P wastes would be to determine the applicability of the characteristiclevels of the ``D wastes'' as a performance standard. While characterization data on the U andamp; P forms of these wastes is limited,performance data from other wastes containing similar compounds and havingsimilar waste characteristics which affect performance may be transferredin order to set performance standards. Another problem is that many of these compounds will dissociate upon contactwith water. This dissociation further complicates the ability to identifythe specific compound listed. In cases where the compound dissociates inwater, quantitative analysis for the metal constituent is believed to bean effective measure of the concentration of the compound. With regard to specific metals; the Agency already possesses substantialdata on the treatment of chromium in wastes. For U032, calcium chromate,a chromium standard would regulate the compound by assuring a certain concentrationin the waste and/or leachate. The behavior of mercury also causes treatment performance obstacles. First,mercury is a liquid at room temperature with appreciable vapor pressure.The Agency has performance data on stabilization techniques which implythat only low levels of mercury (andless;100 ppm) can be reduced in mobility.Since spills, off-spec materials, and container residues are expected tocontain higher levels than this, it cannot be expected that these materialswill be effectively immobilized by stabilization techniques.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2(0),p0,i1,s25,xs25</C><T4> Table </T4>18._<T4>Metal Wastes</T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">P010_Arsenic acid <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P011_Arsenic (V) oxide<D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P012_Arsenic (III) oxide<D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P036_Dichlorophenylarsine <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P038_Diethylarsine <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P065_Mercury Fulminate <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P092_Phenylmercuric acetate <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P103_Selenourea <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P110_Tetraethyl lead <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P113_Thallic oxide <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P114_Thallium Selenite <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P115_Thallium (I) sulfate <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P119_Ammonium vanadate <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P120_Vanadium pentoxide <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U032_Calcium chromate <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U136_Cacodylic acid <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U144_Lead acetate <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U145_Lead phosphate <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U146_Lead subacetate <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U151_Mercury <D>(1st) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U204_Selenious acid <D>(3rd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U205_Selenium disulfide <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U214_Thallium (I) acetate <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U215_Thallium (I) carbonate <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U216_Thallium (I) chloride <D>(2nd) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U217_Thallium (I) nitrate <D>(2nd)</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">10. EPA's Approach for Developing BDAT Treatment Standards for CharacteristicWastes </ITAG>This section of today's preamble presents a discussion of the approachesand options that the Agency is considering for establishing BDAT treatmentstandards for characteristic wastes. This discussion is intended to giveadvance notice to the regulated community and to provide an opportunityfor it to comment on these approaches and to submit data that may helpin developing such standards. At this time, the Agency is not proposingtreatment standards for any of the wastes listed in this section. Pleaseidentify comments on this section with the heading ``Comments on EPA'sapproach to remaining wastes''. The criteria for identifying a waste as a characteristic hazardous wasteare defined in 40 CFR 261.21 through 261.24. These criteria identify fourmajor groups of characteristic wastes: Ignitable (D001); Corrosive (D002);Reactive (D003); and EP Toxic (D004-D017). Within each of these groups,there are several criteria that define the particular characteristic. Theseindividual criteria were used as the basis for identifying treatabilitygroups (subcategories) within each major characteristic group.The format for implementing BDAT standards for characteristic wastes maybe different than that used for other wastes. This is because of a differencein the nature of hazardous waste status for these wastes. Wastes that arehazardous because they exhibit a characteristic are no longer consideredhazardous if they are treated so that they no longer exhibit any of thecharacteristics andSection; 261.3 (c)(1) and (d)(1). It is possible thatthe use of available technologies will, for many of these wastes, resultin a residual that no longer exhibits any of the characteristics. In thiscase, the waste is no longer subject to the requirements of Subtitle Cof RCRA. However, in some cases, treatment to remove one characteristicmay result in a residue which has a different characteristic, and thusrequires further treatment. Note that if the waste or the residual is mixedwith a listed hazardous waste, it is considered to be a hazardous wasteeven if treated to remove all characteristics. The Agency believes that there are three major options for evaluating potentialstandards for any characteristic waste code or subcategory. The first optionis for EPA to propose numerical and/or ``No Land Disposal'' treatment standards.The second option is to propose a method or sequence of methods of treatmentas BDAT. The third option is to not establish any treatment standard andthereby allow the ``hard hammer'' to go into effect (resulting in a banof land disposal of the waste). Although EPA initially took the positionthat identified hazardous wastes (i.e., those that are hazardous exclusivelyby virtue of exhibiting a characteristic) are not subject to the section3004(g)(C) hard hammer, See 51 FR 1607 n.4. (Jan. 14, 1986), EPA no longerholds this view. The reference in section 3004(g)(6)(C) appears to encompassall wastes for which EPA has an obligation to establish treatment standardsunder paragraph (g)(5), which includes identified hazardous wastes. Inaddition, the legislative history is unambiguous that Congress intendedEPA to include identified wastes (i.e., those identified as of the effectivedate of HSWA) under the hard hammer. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1133, 98th Cong.,2d Sess. (1984). Selection of these options vary depending on the particularsubcategory of characteristic waste within each of the four major groups.The following discussions present the various issues and possible regulatoryalternatives for each subcategory.a. <T3>D001 Ignitable Wastes.</T3> According to 40 CFR 261.2l, there are fourcriteria for defining a waste as a D001 Ignitable Waste. Paraphrasing thesecriteria, a waste can be a D001 waste if: (1) it is a liquid with a flashpoint less than 140anddegrees;F; or (2) it is not a liquid and is capableof causing fire through friction, absorption of moisture, or spontaneouschemical changes and, when ignited, burns vigorously and persistently;or (3) it is an ignitable compressed gas; or (4) it is an oxidizer. EPA determined that these four criteria translated directly into four treatabilitygroups for D001 wastes. The first treatability group is classified as theIgnitable Liquids Subcategory and refers to those D001 wastes that exhibitthe properties listed in andSection; 261.21(a)(1). The second treatabilitygroup is classified as the Ignitable Reactives Subcategory and refers tothose D001 wastes that exhibit the properties listed in andSection; 261.21(a)(2).The third treatability group is classified as the Ignitable Gases Subcategoryand refers to those D001 wastes that exhibit the properties listed in andSection;261.21(a)(3). The fourth treatability group is classified as the OxidizersSubcategory and refers to those D001 wastes that exhibit the propertieslisted in andSection; 261.21(a)(4). D001 wastes in the Ignitable Liquids Subcategory are primarily organicliquids. These include unlisted solvents, paint thinners, contaminatedoils and various organic hydrocarbons. The majority of all D001 wastesthat are generated can be identified as Ignitable Liquids. These wastesare generated by almost every industry and represent a significant proportionof all hazardous wastes. Ignitable Liquids are already banned from disposalin landfills due to existing regulations on ignitable wastes and on liquidwastes. While these wastes are not typically placed in other land disposalunits, it is possible that small amounts of certain water soluble D001wastes in this subcategory have been or are being placed in surface impoundmentsfor the purposes of biodegradation. The Agency believes that most D001 Ignitable Liquids are already beingtreated by incineration, reused as a fuel substitute (due to their highBTU content) or recovered for reuse through processes such as distillation.This subcategory of D001 wastes has been defined as hazardous due to itslow flash point. This is due directly to the chemical and physical propertiesof the organics in the waste. Any thermal technology such as incinerationand reuse as a fuel will completely remove this characteristic of low flashpoint by destroying these organics, thereby rendering the waste nonignitable.Based on the fact that these techniques remove the characteristic of ignitability,EPA is anticipating proposing a treatment standard of ``No Land DisposalBased On Thermal Destruction'' for D001 Ignitable Liquids Subcategory.This standard would not establish thermal destruction as a mandatory processfor handling D001 Ignitable Liquids, but rather it would prevent placementof these wastes in land disposal units by indicating that there are existingalternatives for management of these wastes. The Agency specifically does not want to preclude anyone from using distillationor other recovery techniques for these wastes. At the same time, the Agencydoes not believe that most of these wastes are necessarily recoverableby processes such as distillation. While these options may be preferableover thermal destruction for some of these D001 wastes, the end resultof ``No Land Disposal'' is the same. The choice between thermal destructionand recovery may then be made by the generator or treater, based on economicsand on the ability of the particular recovery system to handle the waste.It is important to point out that the residues, if any, from all of thermaldestruction processes may possibly be considered other hazardous wastes.In particular, these ash residues may exhibit the characteristic of EPToxicity for metals. Some D001 Ignitable Liquids have been shown to contain some organic constituentsthat are also constituents in F001-F005 solvents. The Agency could proposeto transfer the standards for these constituents from the correspondingstandards for F001-F005 solvents promulgated in the November 7, 1986 SolventRule (51 FR 40642). However, the Agency believes that this would createan unnecessary burden on the regulated community in several ways. The majorityof D001 wastes in the Ignitable Liquids Subcategory probably do not containthese constituents and those generators of D001 wastes that do not havethese constituents would then be required to perform a significant amountof unnecessary testing and certification.D001 wastes in the Ignitable Reactives Subcategory are primarily inorganicsolids or wastes containing reactive materials. These include materialssuch as reactive alkali metals or metaloids (such as sodium and potassium),calcium carbide slags, and phosphorus. All of these are very reactive withwater and will generate gases that can ignite due to heat generated fromthe reaction with water. Other ignitable solids in this subcategory includemetals such as magnesium and aluminum that can vigorously react with theoxygen in the air. There appears to be an overlap of this D001 subcategorywith certain D003 reactive wastes. However, a close examination of thedefinitions in andSection; 261.21(a)(2) for ignitable wastes and andSection;261.23(a) (2), (3) and (6) for reactive wastes reveals the distinction.The key difference is found in the phrase ``* * * when ignited, burns vigorouslyand persistently.'' for ignitable wastes. This implies that the hazardis due primarily to the ignition potential rather than the extreme reactivity.D001 Ignitable Reactives are generated on a sporadic basis and generallyin low volumes. They are not typically placed in surface impoundments dueto the fire danger associated with their reactivity with water. Some of these D001 wastes, such as calcium carbide slag, are often placedin specially designed units (some may be technically classified as wastepiles by the Agency) for the purposes of controlled deactivation with water.Other wastes, such as those containing reactive alkali metals (sodium)are often open detonated. The Agency believes that these D001 IgnitableReactives are being treated in a manner that renders the waste nonignitable.Unlike the Ignitable Liquids, all of the known treatment processes forthe Ignitable Reactives may result in significant amounts of solid residues.These residues may or may not exhibit the characteristic of EP Toxicityfor metals. Further, the Agency believes that development of any numericaltreatment standards, based on either chemical deactivation or open detonation,would be difficult because there is no known analytical test that is designedto measure the ignitability of these reactive materials nor is there atest that distinguishes the reactive chemical from the deactivated chemical(e.g. sodium). Based on the fact that open detonation and controlled chemical deactivationwill remove the characteristic of ignitability for the D001 Ignitable Reactives,EPA is considering proposing these technologies as methods of treatments,rather than establishing a numeric standard. Another approach that the Agency may take is to propose a ``No Land DisposalBased on Deactivation'' standard for these wastes. By establishing thisas a treatment standard, the Agency believes that the variance procedurescould be used as a method of providing a more complete evaluation of thesafety hazards associated with each individual deactivation or open detonationprocedure at each facility. The Agency is soliciting comments and data on the physical and chemicalcharacterization of these D001 Ignitable Reactives as well as on the applicabilityof chemical deactivation and open detonation to these wastes. Facilitieswith wastes in this subcategory that are not amenable to these techniquesshould submit data and information on the characteristics of these wastesand the technical justification for why the technologies are not amenableto their wastes. D001 wastes in the Oxidizers Subcategory are primarily inorganic. Theseinclude wastes such as waste peroxides, perchlorates and permanganates.These wastes must meet the definition of an oxidizer according to 49 CFR173.151. For D001 wastes in the Oxidizers Subcategory deactivation withan appropriate chemical reagent to render the waste nonignitable appearsto be the primary applicable treatment option. At this time, the Agencyhas very limited information on the generation and characterization ofD001 wastes in this subcategory. While it is possible that certain aqueoussolutions of these oxidizers may be useful in the treatment of other hazardouswastes, the Agency believes that these wastes should be deactivated (orused as treatment reagents) in tanks and not in surface impoundments, dueto the potential release of heat and volatile organics during the oxidation/reductionreactions. Therefore, the Agency is considering proposing a treatment standardof ``No Land Disposal Based on Deactivation'' for D001 wastes in the OxidizersSubcategory. D001 wastes in the Ignitable Gases Subcategory are those that meet thedefinition of an ignitable compressed gas according to 49 CFR 173.300.At this time, the Agency has very limited information on the generationand characterization of D001 wastes in this subcategory. The Agency suspectsthat while these wastes may be generated, it is unlikely that they wouldrequire placement in any type of land disposal unit. Therefore, the Agencyis seriously considering allowing the ``hard hammer'' provision to takeeffect for this subcategory. b. <T3>D002 Corrosive Wastes.</T3> According to 40 CFR 261.22, there are twocriteria for defining a waste as a D002 Corrosive waste. Paraphrasing thesecriteria, a waste can be a D002 waste if: (1) It is aqueous and has a pHless than or equal to 2 or greater than or equal to 12.5; or (2) it isa liquid and corrodes steel at a specified rate and temperature. EPA determined that these criteria translated into three treatability groupsfor D002 wastes. The first two treatability groups are classified as theAcid Subcategory and the Alkaline Subcategory and refer to those D002 wastesthat exhibit the properties listed in andSection; 261.22(a)(1). The two subcategoriesare distinguishable by the listed pH specifications and the obvious differencein neutralization reagent requirements. The Acid Subcategory is definedas those with a pH of less than or equal to 2 and the Alkaline Subcategoryis defined as those with a pH of greater than or equal to 12.5. Also bydefinition, D002 wastes in the Acid Subcategory and Alkaline Subcategoryonly include wastes which are considered to be ``aqueous''. This is dueto the fact that standard pH measurement can only be performed in the presenceof significant amounts of water (i.e., pH is the measure of the concentrationof acidic hydronium ions in water). The third treatability group is classifiedas the Other Corrosives Subcategory and is defined as those D002 wastesthat exhibit the corrosivity to steel as listed in andSection; 261.22(a)(2).These often are nonaqueous corrosive wastes such as certain organic liquids.D002 wastes in the Acid Subcategory typically include concentrated spentacids, acidic wastewaters, and spent acid strippers and cleaners. Similarly,those wastes in the Alkaline Subcategory typically include concentratedspent bases, alkaline wastewaters, and spent alkaline strippers and cleaners.The majority of all D002 wastes that are generated are in the Acid Subcategory.However, a good proportion of D002 wastes generated are in the AlkalineSubcategory (particularly the strippers and cleaners). Wastes from bothof these subcategories are generated by almost every industry and representa significant proportion of all hazardous wastes. Wastes in the Other CorrosivesSubcategory are generated on a sporadic basis and generally in low volumes.The Agency suspects that these wastes are often identified as corrosivewithout performing the specified testing with steel (i.e., the corrosivityof the waste may be assumed due the presence of known corrosive constituents).This may also be due, in part, to the high cost of testing and to the difficultiesin identifying laboratories that are experienced in the steel corrosiontesting. The Agency believes that most D002 wastes in both the Acid and AlkalineSubcategories are already being treated by neutralization. These subcategorieshave been defined as hazardous due to their extremes in pH. Any neutralizationtechnology will completely remove this characteristic of pH; thereby renderingthe waste noncorrosive. Some facilities generate waste streams which fluctuatefrom the Acid Subcategory to the Alkaline Subcategory depending upon whatprocess they use on a given day. However, the Agency believes that thesefacilities can utilize the fluctuations in pH as a means of performingon-site neutralization.Based on the fact that these techniques remove the characteristic of corrosivity,EPA is anticipating proposing a treatment standard of ``No Land DisposalBased on Neutralization'' for both of these subcategories of D002 wastes.Under the California List restrictions, the Agency has already promulgatedregulations for liquid wastes having a pH of less than or equal to 2.0,by codifying the statutory restriction andSection; 268.32. Therefore, somecommenters may question the need for establishing a standard. However,these restrictions only referred to these wastes as ``Corrosive wastes''without specifically identifying them as D002 wastes and the statutoryrestriction did not specify neutralization as a required treatment standard.The Agency is considering clarifying this by specifically proposing the``No Land Disposal Based on Neutralization'' for the D002 Acid Subcategory.In addition, there were no restrictions established for D002 Alkaline Subcategoryand the Agency has some concerns that there may be issues raised by industrythat this standard may not be applicable to all D002 wastes in the AlkalineSubcategory. By identifying these as two different subcategories, it allowsfor potential differences in the development of standards due to potentialissues that have yet to be identified.It is important to point out that the residues from all neutralizationprocesses may possibly be considered other hazardous wastes. In particular,the neutralization sludge residues may exhibit the characteristic of EPToxicity for metals. Neutralization is a preferred option over simple dilution. While dilution,which is currently allowed as a means of eliminating a hazardous wastecharacteristic, it often requires copious quantities of water or wastewaters.In addition, ``dilution'' of a RCRA hazardous corrosive waste to a neutralpH (i.e., as defined using a pH between 6.0 and 8.5) is currently not required.In considering the treatment standard for D002 wastes in these two subcategories,the Agency considered the possibility of establishing a standard of neutralityfor these wastes (i.e., pH 6.0 to 8.5). However, previous RCRA regulationsspecifically state that dilution is acceptable for corrosive characteristicwastes and that elementary neutralization can be performed without certainRCRA permitting procedures. Thus, EPA believes that it cannot establisha numerical pH standard for D002 wastes based on neutralization, but instead,can only require removal of the corrosive characteristic which, in thecase of the Acid and Alkaline Subcategories, means adjusting the pH tobetween 2.0 and 12.5. As an alternative to this standard for both of these subcategories, theAgency is considering the simple proposal of neutralization as a methodof treatment. However, by establishing the standard of ``No Land DisposalBased on Neutralization'', the Agency believes that a variance from thisstandard could be considered for D002 wastes which for some reason or anothercould not be effectively neutralized. This may occur for some small quantitiesof corrosive materials that contained quantities of extremely toxic orotherwise hazardous chemicals that may cause an unnecessary risk duringneutralization. Recovery options for these concentrated corrosive wastes have been demonstratedfor a variety of wastes. While these options may be preferred over neutralization,the end result of no land disposal is the same. The choice between neutralizationand recovery may be made by the generator or a centralized treatment operation,according to the applicability and performance of a given type of acid/baserecovery system. The smallest volume of D002 wastes fall under the Other Corrosives Subcategory.The physical and chemical characteristics of this group of wastes varygreatly. Overall, the wastes may be aqueous or they may be primarily organic.In addition, there exists a large variety of corrosive chemicals that maybe appearing as constituents in this type of corrosive waste. Wastes containingthese chemicals may corrode SAE 1020 steel depending on the concentrationof these chemicals in the waste. Examples of chemicals that may contributeto this corrosivity include: ferric chloride, benzene sulfonyl chloride,benzotrichloride, acetyl chloride, formic acid, hydrofluoric acid, phenol,triethylamine, some catalysts, various resins, metal cleaners and etchants.As noted above, dilution is allowed in order to remove the characteristicof corrosivity. For D002 wastes in the Other Corrosives Subcategory, deactivationby dilution appears to be an applicable treatment option. Other applicabletreatment options include deactivation of the corrosive constituents ofthe waste with an appropriate chemical reagent to render the constituentnoncorrosive. Incineration of D002 wastes that contain high concentrationsof corrosive organics is a common practice. However, due to the great varietyof corrosive organics that exist, the Agency does not believe that it shouldestablish chemical specific standards based on incineration for these D002wastes. Removal and recovery of either organic or inorganic corrosive constituentsmay also be applicable technologies which could render these wastes noncorrosive.Recovery could involve extraction of the corrosive constituents, untilthe waste itself was no longer considered corrosive (to steel). Based on this information, EPA presently intends to propose a treatmentstandard of ``No Land Disposal Based on Deactivation'' for D002 wastesin the Other Corrosives Subcategory. By establishing this standard, theAgency believes that a variance from it could then be considered for D002wastes which for some reason could not be effectively deactivated. Dilutionof these wastes could be considered a viable deactivation procedure providedno other technique could be identified. EPA is currently conducting laboratory analysis of a waste which exhibitsthe characteristic of corrosivity that falls in the Other Corrosives Subcategory.This waste is a spent catalyst which contains a high level of ferric chloridesuspended in a chlorinated organic phase. The Agency is conducting teststo chemically deactivate the waste through dilution to the point whereit no longer corrodes steel. The volume increase resulting from this deactivationby dilution will be assessed prior to proposal of any treatment standards.The Agency is soliciting comments and data on the physical and chemicalcharacterization of all three subcategories of DO02 wastes as well as onthe applicability of dilution, chemical deactivation, and recovery to thesewastes. Facilities with wastes in these subcategories which are not amenableto neutralization or deactivation techniques should submit data and informationon the characteristics of these wastes and the technical justificationfor why they are not amenable to neutralization or deactivation.<T3>c. </T3><T3>D003 Reactive Wastes.</T3> According to 40 CFR 26l.23, there are eightcriteria for defining a waste as a D003 Reactive waste. Paraphrasing thesecriteria, a waste can be a D003 waste if: (1) it is unstable and readilyundergoes violent changes without detonating; or (2) it reacts violentlywith water; or (3) it forms potentially explosive mixtures with water;or (4) when mixed with water, it generates toxic gases; or (5) it is acyanide or sulfide bearing waste which under certain conditions can generatetoxic gases; or (6) it is capable of detonation or explosive reaction ifit is subjected to a strong initiating source or if heated under confinement;or (7) it is readily capable of detonation or explosive decomposition orreaction at standard temperature and pressure; or (8) it is a forbiddenexplosive, a Class A explosive, or a Class B explosive. EPA determined that these eight criteria translated directly into fivetreatability groups for D003 wastes. The first treatability group is classifiedas the Reactive Cyanides Subcategory and refers to those D003 wastes thatexhibit the properties listed in andSection;andSection; 261.23(a)(5) for cyanide.The second treatability group is classified as the Explosives Subcategoryand refers to those D003 wastes that exhibit the properties listed in andSection;andSection;261.23(a)(6) through 261.23(a)(8). The third treatability group is classifiedas the Water Reactive Subcategory and refers to those D003 wastes thatexhibit the properties listed in andSection;andSection; 261.23(a)(2) through262.23(a)(4). The fourth treatability group is classified as the ReactiveSulfides Subcategory and refers to those DO03 wastes that exhibit the propertieslisted in andSection; 261.23(a)(5) for sulfide. The fifth treatability groupis classified as the Other Reactives Subcategory and refers to those D003wastes that exhibit the properties listed in andSection; 261.23(a)(l). D003 wastes in the Reactive Cyanides Subcategory are by definition thosecyanide bearing wastes that generate toxic gases (assumed to be HCN) whenexposed to pH conditions between 2 and 12.5 in a sufficient quantity topresent a danger to human health and the environment. These D003 wastestypically have been identified as being generated by the electroplatingand metal finishing industries and include mixed cyanide salts, cyanidesolutions and cyanide bearing sludges. The majority of the quantity ofall D003 wastes that are generated can be identified as belonging to theReactive Cyanides Subcategory. Reactive cyanide wastes are already restricted from disposal in landfillsdue to existing regulations on reactive wastes. Under the California Listrestrictions, the statute already prohibits liquid wastes having a freecyanide concentrations in excess of 1,000 mg/kg (ppm), from being landdisposed, as codified in $268.31. However, these restrictions only referredto these wastes as ``Cyanide wastes'' without specifically identifyingthem as D003 wastes or any of the other wastes listed for containing cyanides.The statutory restriction did not specify any treatment technology nordid it establish the 1,000 mg/kg as a ``treatment standard''. While thesereactive cyanide wastes are not typically placed in most types of landdisposal units, it is possible that some have been or are being placedin surface impoundments. The Agency believes that most D003 Reactive Cyanides are already beingtreated by alkaline chlorination or electro-oxidation. This subcategoryof D003 wastes has been defined as hazardous due to its reactive levelof cyanides. This is due directly to the high concentrations of the cyanidesin the waste. Any oxidation/reduction technology such as alkaline chlorinationor electro-oxidation is believed to be able to lower the concentrationof cyanide so that the waste would probably not contain reactive levelsof cyanides, thereby removing the hazardous characteristic. One of theoptions that EPA is considering for establishing treatment standards forwastes in the D003 Reactive Cyanides Subcategory is the direct transferof numerical treatment standards for total and amenable cyanides from cyanidewastes from electroplating, heat treating, or acrylonitrile production(See also, section III.A.8.a. of today's preamble). D003 wastes in the Explosives Subcategory are by definition those wastesthat are capable of detonation or explosive reaction under various conditionsor are forbidden Class A, or Class B explosives (according to 49 CFR 173.52,.53, and .88 respectively). These typically have been identified as beinggenerated by the explosives industry and the U.S. Department of Defense.While these wastes are not as frequently generated as the Reactive Cyanides,they are generated more often than all other reactive subcategories. Explosivesare already restricted from disposal in landfills due to existing regulationson reactive wastes. While these explosive wastes are not typically placedin most types of land disposal units, it used to be a very common practiceto open detonate these wastes. In fact, the Agency believes that most D003wastes that are generated in the Explosives Subcategory are currently treatedby either open detonation or incineration in specially designed units.By simple deduction this process would be expected to remove the explosivecharacteristic of the D003 waste.Incineration of D003 wastes in the Explosives Subcategory also appearsto be an applicable technology. However, this requires incineration unitsthat are specially designed and fitted with certain explosion-proof equipment.These type of units are not typically found at commercial incinerationfacilities. The Agency is aware that these types of units are currentlyused for many of the Department of Defense explosive wastes and that thereappears to be a trend to decrease the reliance on open detonation for thesewastes. However, at this time, the Agency is only in the initial investigationof these issues for these explosive wastes (with respect to the developmentof treatment standards for the land disposal restrictions program). Whileincineration appears to be a feasible option, the Agency is currently consideringchemical deactivation and open detonation for the development of a treatmentstandard for these wastes. The Agency notes that it is unlikely that theAgency would preclude incineration in these specialized units by developinga proposed standard based on either chemical deactivation or open detonation.D003 wastes in the Water Reactive Subcategory can be either organic orinorganic in nature. All of these are either very reactive with water orcan generate toxic or explosive gases with water. While one might anticipatethat an apparent applicable treatment technology for these wastes wouldbe to react the wastes with water, these reactions are often very vigorousand extremely difficult to control. The most common treatment for thesewastes is actually open detonation. It is theorized that the reactive organicconstituents are destroyed by the explosion and that the reactive inorganicconstituents form less hazardous oxides or react with other chemicals inthe explosion (such as moisture from the air). Wastes in the Water ReactiveSubcategory are generated on a sporadic basis and generally in low volumes.These wastes are not typically placed in land disposal units and are certainlynot typically placed in surface impoundments due to their violent reactivitywith water. An approach that the Agency is considering is to propose a ``No Land DisposalBased on Deactivation'' standard for the D003 reactive wastes in ExplosivesSubcategory and Water Reactives Subcategory. By establishing this as atreatment standard, the Agency believes that the variance procedures couldbe used as a method of providing a more complete evaluation of the safetyhazards associated with each individual deactivation or open detonationprocedure at each facility. This may be the preferred approach, in that;(1) It appears to provide more assurance of the protection of human healthand the environment at each individual site by providing a more extensivetechnical evaluation by regulatory personnel; (2) it allows the wastesto be treated by any treatment technology that may be developed (such asspecially designed incineration units); and (3) it also bans most formsof land disposal. D003 wastes in the Reactive Sulfides Subcategory are by definition thosesulfide bearing wastes that generate toxic gases (assumed to be H<T2>2</T2>S) when exposed to pH conditions between 2 and 12.5 in a sufficientquantity to present a danger to human health and the environment. At thistime, the Agency is only in the initial investigation of these issues forthese reactive wastes (with respect to the development of treatment standardsfor the land disposal restrictions program). Treatment for sulfide wastesmight be to chemically convert the reactive sulfides to inert sulfur, toinsoluble metallic salts, or to soluble sulfates that can be removed orrecovered. The Agency believes that some of these wastes may also be contaminatedwith organic sulfides known as mercaptans. These malodorous chemicals arebelieved to complicate the treatment of these reactive sulfide wastes.It is believed that these type of wastes have been particular treatmentproblems for the petroleum refining industry. The Agency is hereby solicitingwaste characterization and treatment data that could be used to aid inthe potential development of treatment standards for these wastes. Currently,the Agency has not approved a standard analytical method for testing eithersulfides or reactive sulfides in hazardous wastes or in treatment residues.It is unlikely, therefore, that the Agency will be able to propose a numericaltreatment standard for D003 wastes in this subcategory. D003 wastes in the Other Reactives Subcategory can be either organic orinorganic in nature. Information suggests that these wastes are infrequentlygenerated and probably in small quantities. These wastes do not appearto be placed in land disposal units. At this time, the Agency is only inthe initial stages of investigation of these issues for these reactivewastes (with respect to the development of treatment standards for theland disposal restrictions program). In general, the Agency believes thatthese unstable wastes can either be incinerated in special units or opendetonated. The Agency suspects that while these wastes may be generated,it is unlikely that they would require placement in any type of land disposalunit. Therefore, the Agency is seriously considering allowing the ``hardhammer'' provisions to take effect for this subcategory.All of the known treatment processes for all of the five subcategoriesof D003 Reactive Wastes can result in significant amounts of solid residues.These residues may or may not exhibit the characteristic of EP Toxicityfor metals. Instead of trying to establish metal standards for these residues,the Agency prefers to regulate land disposal of them only if they appearto be EP Toxic wastes. Thus, the Agency is currently not considering proposingstandards for metals in the residues from the deactivation of D003 wastes.Further, for all subcategories of D003 wastes except the Reactive Cyanides,the Agency believes that development of any numerical treatment standards,based on any of the appropriate deactivation techniques, would be difficultto develop because there is no known analytical test that is designed tomeasure the reactivity of these wastes nor is there a test that distinguishesthe reactive chemical from the deactivated chemical (e.g. sodium). The Agency is soliciting comments and data on the physical and chemicalcharacterization of all five D003 subcategories as well as on the applicabilityof chemical deactivation, incineration, and open detonation to these wastes.Facilities with wastes in these subcategories that are not amenable tothese techniques should submit data and information on the characteristicsof these wastes and the technical justification for why the technologiesare not amenable to their wastes. <T3>d. EP Toxic Wastes.</T3> Paraphrasing the criteria in 40 CFR 261.24,a waste is considered a characteristic EP Toxic waste provided that, theextract (using an approved extraction procedure referred to as the EP)from a representative sample of the waste contains any of the contaminantslisted in andSection; 261.24 Table I at a concentration equal to or greaterthan the respective value given in that table. A waste can be identifiedas an EP Toxic characteristic waste based on the concentration of one ofeight different metals or six chlorinated pesticides. The Agency examined these fourteen chemical constituents for similaritiesin treatability and determined that while there are two obvious major treatabilitygroups of metals and of pesticides, the definition of separate treatabilitysubcategories within these major groups could not be performed at thistime. However, the Agency has determined that there are certain similaritiesin chemical and physical nature of the various metals and pesticides thatappear to be the potential basis for future definition of treatabilitysubcategories. This section of the preamble discusses these similaritiesand outlines only a few of the possible alternatives for developing treatmentstandards for these EP Toxic wastes. <T3>1. Arsenic, Chromium and Selenium (D004, D007 and D010). </T3>Whilearsenic (D004), chromium (D007) and selenium (D010) all exhibit positivevalence states, they show little tendency to exist as solitary cationicspecies in aqueous solutions. They typically exist in aqueous conditionsas oxo-anions [i.e., arsenic appears as arsenite (AsO<T2>2</T2>^) and arsenate (AsO<T2>4</T2>^3), while chromium appears as chromate (CrO<T2>4</T2>^2) and dichromate (Cr<T2>2</T2>O<T2>7</T2>^2)]. This behavior differs from that of other metals, in thatother metals usually exhibit strong cationic behavior in aqueous conditions.Thus, selection and performance of various treatment technologies is oftendifferent for arsenic, selenium and chromium bearing wastes compared towastes containing only other metal constituents. Applicable treatment technologies that the Agency is considering for arsenic,selenium, and chromium wastes include: (1) Recycling/recovery technologiessuch as high temperature metals recycling, freeze concentration, and ionexchange; (2) chemical reduction (such as the conversion of hexavalentchromium to the trivalent state) using reagents such as sulfur dioxide,sodium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, sodium hydrosulfite, and/or ferroussulfate; (3) chemical oxidation using reagents such as hypochlorite, chlorine,hydrogen peroxide, and/or potassium permanganate; (4) metals precipitationusing a combination of lime and sulfide; and (5) specialized stabilizationsuch as vitrification/molten glass stabilization or stabilization withadditives such as red clays, silicates, and proprietary binders. The Agency believes that recovery of arsenic, selenium, and chromium maybe feasible for some wastes provided the metal has been first chemicallyconverted to an easily recoverable form. Information regarding problemswith recovery of arsenic from wastes is described in section III.A.11.a.of this preamble (i.e., a discussion of waste codes K031, K084, K101, andK102). Information suggests that recovery of elemental selenium out ofcertain types of scrap material is currently practiced in the United States,and it may be possible to extrapolate this technology to other forms ofselenium wastes. Ion exchange has been reported to be effective for therecovery of chromium from wastewaters, and for purification of some chromicacid solutions. It has been reported that anionic exchange has been employedfor the removal chromate and dichromate from some wastes. Evaporative recoveryas well as freeze recovery are two concentration processes that have beensuggested for recovery of chromium from rinsewaters and some other wastewaters.The Agency is requesting comments and data as to the applicability of theseand any other recovery technologies for wastes containing EP Toxic concentrationsof arsenic, chromium and/or selenium. More extensive treatment trains appear to be necessary to treat some complexwastes such as wood preserving wastes and other wastes that are EP Toxicfor both arsenic and chromium. Besides the reduction step for the hexavalentchromium, an additional oxidation step with reagents such as hydrogen peroxideor hypochlorite, may be necessary for the arsenic. The presence of organicsand organo-metallic complexes would further complicate the treatment process.These may have to be oxidized or otherwise removed prior to conversionof the metals to their proper valence state for further metal treatmentsuch as precipitation. Precipitation of arsenic from wastewaters identified as D004 appears tobe effective under certain alkaline conditions. Information regarding applicabilityand performance of lime versus sulfide precipitation for wastewaters containingarsenic is described in significantly greater detail in section III.A.11.a.of this preamble. In general, while typical lime and/or sulfide precipitationprocedures (without the proper pretreatment steps) may be effective forremoval of all three of these metals from wastewaters, the chemical stateof these metals in the resultant treatment sludge may not be correct tominimize the leachability of these metals during land disposal. In addition,further treatment with typical cementitious stabilization may actuallyincrease the leachability of these metals, if they are not in the properchemical state. The Agency attempted cement stabilization of wastes that contain high concentrationsof arsenic (K031). The resultant data indicated that the leachability ofarsenic from the treated residues increased by orders of magnitude overthe leachability from the untreated wastes. Typically, chemical stabilizationof sludges containing metals is partly based on the ability of the alkalinecementitious reagents to chemically bind the cationic metal species. TheAgency believes that the increase in leachability of arsenic after stabilizationis probably due to the increased solubility of various forms of arsenicat higher pH. In addition, this increase in leachability seems to be indicatingthat the arsenic is not being chemically bound by the stabilization reagents.While the Agency has not fully investigated these potential problems insolidification for high concentrations of selenium, some information suggeststhat these complications will occur.Several alternatives to cementitious stabilization for arsenic, chromiumand selenium wastes are currently under consideration by the Agency includingvitrification or molten glass stabilization, the use of red clays containingalumina as additives to the stabilization process, and the use of othernoncementitious proprietary binders for stabilization. The Agency is currentlyplanning on conducting stabilization tests for certain arsenic and chromiumwastes. However at this time, it has not established which wastes or whichprocesses will be studied. The Agency is therefore, soliciting commentsand data on these stabilization techniques for arsenic, selenium and chromiumand is particularly interested in data for wastes (solid or liquid) withconcentrations of these metals greater than l% (by weight) as well as datafor those wastes that are known to contain organo-complexes of these metals.<T3>2. Cadmium, Lead and Mercury (D006, D008 and D009). </T3>Applicabletreatment technologies that the Agency is considering for cadmium (D006),lead (D008), and mercury (D009) wastes include: (1) Recycling/recoverytechnologies such as acid leaching, high temperature metals recycling,and ion exchange; (2) chemical oxidation/reduction; (3) metals precipitation;(4) incineration of wastes high in organics; and (5) conventional and specializedstabilization processes with additives such as sulfides, silicates andproprietary binders. The Agency currently has performance data on an acid leaching/chemicaloxidation/filtration washing, as well as simple water washing and filtration,for nonwastewaters contaminated with mercury (i.e., K071 wastes). The Agencyalso has performance data on sulfide precipitation/filtration of mercurycontaining wastewaters. Currently, cementitious stabilization of mercurynonwastewaters has not been demonstrated as effective for mercury wastes.The Agency intends to analyze treatability groups for all mercury wastesto determine which portions of these performance data can be transferredto D009 nonwastewaters. For some other D009 nonwastewaters (such as wastescontaminated with liquid or elemental mercury), the Agency is consideringretorting, amalgamation with zinc, and/or denuding of mercury amalgamsto regenerate mercury and zinc. Along with investigating the potentialtransfer of existing performance data for these D009 nonwastewaters, theAgency intends to investigate chemical reduction of mercury contaminatedwastewaters followed by retorting of the filtration residuals (K106). Atthis time, the Agency is actively pursuing possible testing of a K106 retortsystems that may be applicable to other mercury wastes. The Agency solicitscomment and data on the above listed treatment technologies for D009 wastes.EPA has promulgated lead treatment standards for many listed wastes (bothwastewaters and nonwastewaters). K062 is the primary source of wastewatertreatment data for lead. In addition, the Agency has performance data onstabilization of F006, K061, and K062 nonwastewaters that contain variousconcentrations of lead. EPA has High Temperature Metal Recovery data onK061, and information indicating recovery of lead from F006, K002-K007,K069 and lead acid batteries. The data on F006 indicate that stabilizationmay often result in a treated waste that remains a EP Toxic waste for lead.This is particularly true, if the EP concentration is lowered for thiscontaminant. Thus, it appears that some (if not many) D008 wastes, whentreated, will remain D008 wastes (albeit, wastes with much lower leachability).This appears to imply that the Agency should not allow the ``hard hammer''provisions to take effect for D008 wastes. Besides the wastes that can be effectively stabilized and those which arebeing sent to recovery facilities due to the high lead content, there appearto be several potential subcategories of EP Toxic lead wastes that maynot be able to be readily treated by these technologies. Wastes which aremostly organic and contaminated with lead appear to represent a large portionof the number of D008 wastes. These include wastes from the removal ofleaded paints from buildings, leaded paints and paint sludges, and analyticalsamples from lead testing programs. Organo-lead compounds such as tetraethyllead (Pl10) may require pretreatment to break the organo-metallic bondprior to further treatment such as stabilization. Incineration or otherthermal destruction may be possible for all of the organo-lead materials(including the paint wastes) provided these wastes can be thoroughly mixedwith other wastes, so as to meet strict metals emissions standards forlead. The resultant ash would probably require an additional solidificationstep. Other inorganic nonwastewaters with concentrations of lead in thepercent levels, such as lead dross, slag from secondary lead smelting,and residuals from K061 treatment, are sometimes being rejected by leadrecovery facilities for various reasons. These high levels of lead andother contaminants are expected to pose significant problems with stabilization.The Agency is not aware of data in this area, and solicits any available.EPA has performance data on stabilization of cadmium in F006 that is possiblytransferable to other D006 electroplating wastes and to some D006 pigmentwastes. Performance data for cadmium also exist for stabilization and hightemperature metals recovery of K061 wastes. Low concentrations of cadmiumappear to be effectively stabilized using conventional cementitious solidificationprocesses. High levels of cadmium may be more amenable to recovery, althoughcurrent practice shows little recovery of cadmium is currently practiced.<T3>3. Barium and Silver (D005 and D011). </T3>The Agency does not haveenough information at this time to fully characterize barium containingwastes (D005). It is believed that these wastes represent a very smallvolume of wastes. The Agency is investigating stabilization for these wastes.There is some data that suggest that when present as a sulfide these wasteare not soluble and can be stabilized. However, barium is typically removedfrom wastewaters as barium sulfate. If the treatment sludge is a D005 wasteand is high in barium sulfate, then conventional solidification processesmay not be effective in reducing the leachability of these wastes. Cementsthat are designed for high sulfate content would be required. Currently,the Agency has no data for these type of wastes or for this type of solidification.The Agency believes that silver containing wastes are not currently landdisposed. These wastes, although believed to be small in volume, have agreat potential for recovery/reuse because of their economic value. TheAgency does not have enough data to fully characterize these wastes andis requesting comments on current treatment practices and waste generation.However, the Agency is anticipating proposing a standard of ``No Land DisposalBased On Recovery'' for silver containing wastes. <T3>4. D012, D013, D014, D015, D016 and D017. </T3>The Agency believesthat the majority of these wastes, when existing as untreated wastes, maycontain high enough concentrations of their respective halogenated pesticide,that these wastes are already restricted from land disposal on the basisof application of the California List rule for Halogenated Organic Compounds(HOCs). Since the concentrated wastes (greater than 1% HOCs) are probablybeing incinerated, it is likely that the wastes really covered in thissection are those wastes with concentrations of these pesticides betweenEP levels and 1%. Treatment technologies that the Agency has identifiedas applicable for treatment of these wastes are primarily incinerationtechnologies including rotary kiln and fluidized bed. Some of these D012-D0l7wastes are no longer generated because their use as a pesticide has beenbanned. Thus, the Agency may propose a ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation''for these wastes. In considering the development of numerical treatment standards for thesewastes, the regulated constituent for each of these wastes would be theindividual pesticide for which the waste was listed. The Agency is consideringto utilize a transfer of performance data for developing treatment standardsfrom rotary kiln incineration of similar wastes. The strategy of this transferwould be similar to that that the Agency may propose for other chlorinatedpesticide wastes such as K041, K098, U129, U247, U214, P051, and P123.The potential transfer strategy is outlined in the sections of today'spreamble that correspond to the above wastes. If these numerical standardsprove to be lower than the corresponding EP Toxic concentration, the Agencymay then consider proposing a ``No Land Disposal Based on Incineration''for these wastes or may decide to propose no treatment standard and thereby,allow the ``hard hammer'' provisions to take effect for these wastes. However,if the standards are above the corresponding EP Toxic concentration orif no leachability data on incineration ash can be developed for correlationto the EP concentrations, then the Agency probably will propose numericalstandards for the D012-D017 wastes.<ITAG tagnum="81">11. EPA's Approach for Developing BDAT Treatment Standards for allRemaining Listed Wastes </ITAG>This section of today's preamble presents a discussion of the approachesand options that the Agency is considering for establishing BDAT treatmentstandards for the remaining listed ``F'' and ``K'' wastes that have notbeen proposed to date. This includes some First Third wastes for whichland disposal remains regulated under the ``soft hammer'' provisions andsome Third Third wastes for which EPA has just begun investigating treatmentoptions. A synopsis of the status of ongoing treatment evaluations is alsoincluded. Overall, this discussion is intended to give advance notice tothe regulated community and to provide an opportunity for it to commenton these approaches and to submit data that may help in developing suchstandards. At this time, the Agency is not proposing treatment standardsfor any of the wastes listed in this section. Please identify commentson this section with the heading ``Comments on EPA's approach to remainingwastes''. The Agency is specifically soliciting comments on the approach to developtreatment standards for each of the individual wastes or treatability groups.Comments and data on specific treatment technologies for specific wastesor subcategories should include a description of the generation processor processes, complete chemical and physical analyses of the wastes andtreatment residuals (including all appropriate QA/QC information), as wellas technical descriptions of the treatment technologies and their optimumoperating conditions. Facilities planning new tests may wish to communicatewith EPA before testing. <T3>a. First Third Wastes. </T3>Treatment standards for some First Thirdwastes were not promulgated by the statutory deadline, August 8, 1988.As required by the statute, these wastes have become regulated under the``soft hammer'' provisions outlined elsewhere in this preamble. The Agency'sinterpretation of the applicability of the ``soft hammer'' provisions canbe found in 53 FR 31146 (August 17, 1988). The following discussion providesa synopsis of the status of ongoing treatment evaluations for these wastesor groups of wastes. <T3>1. F006-F009, F019, K011-K014, and K036. </T3>Section III.A.8A of today'srule proposes numerical treatment standards for wastewater and nonwastewaterforms of F007, F008, F009, F019, K011, K013, and K014 as well as numericaltreatment standards for cyanides in wastewater forms of F006. In addition,section III.A.8.n. of today's rule proposes a treatment standard for Disulfotonin wastewater forms of K036. Until these standards are promulgated forthese First Third wastes, land disposal of them shall remain regulatedaccording to the ``soft hammer'' provisions. <T3>2. K004, K008, K021, K022, K036, K046, K060, and K061. </T3>While treatmentstandards for nonwastewaters forms of wastes identified as K004, K008,K021, K022, K036, K046 (Nonexplosive Subcategory), K060, and K061 werepromulgated on August 8, 1988, no standards were promulgated for the wastewaterforms of these wastes, nor are there any proposed in today's rule. In general,the Agency intends to develop numerical treatment standards based on treatmentdata that the Agency already possesses. In some cases, treatment standardsfor metals and some organics may be based on data obtained by the Agency'sOffice of Water for the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System(NPDES) program. The Agency believes that hexavalent chromium and lead may be present insome of these wastewaters (such as K004, K008, K022, K046 and K061). Standardsfor chromium, lead and other metals may be developed based on a transferof data from the treatment of K062 (spent pickle liquor). K062 standardswere based on the performance of technologies that included hexavalentchromium reduction, metals precipitation and filtration followed by dewatering.Information also suggests that cyanides may be potentially present in wastewatersidentified as K004, K008 and K060. Standards for cyanides will most likelybe based on performance data from the alkaline chlorination or electro-oxidationof electroplating and heat treating wastes (F006-F012 and F019) as outlinedin section III.A.8A of today's preamble. While the Agency intends to useas much existing data as possible, it is not precluding the use of datasupplied by industry in response to today's proposal nor is it precludingitself from obtaining new data. <T3>3. K017 and K073. </T3>No standards have been promulgated for eitherwastewater or nonwastewater forms of K017 and K073 wastes. The Agency believesthat, as generated, both of these wastes are nonwastewaters that containrelatively high concentrations of chlorinated organics. While the Agencybelieves that the nonwastewater forms of these two wastes are most likelyalready regulated by the California List prohibition on Halogenated OrganicCompounds (HOCs), this prohibition only established incineration and fuelsubstitution as a method of treating HOCs and did not establish numericaltreatment standards for particular halogenated organic constituents. Forthe organic constituents in K017 and K073 wastes, the Agency is consideringthe transfer of performance data from the incineration of K019 and/or F024nonwastewaters. These wastes also contain high concentrations of otherchlorinated organic constituents. The Agency does not intend to specificallyperform analytical testing of the performance of incineration on eitherK017 or K073 wastes. Because of the restrictions on land disposal of HOCs, the Agency anticipatesthat these two wastes are currently being destroyed thermally and is herebysoliciting data generated from this combustion that may aid in the developmentof treatment standards for these wastes. A treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation'' wasoriginally proposed for K073 wastes in the April 8, 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4>. In response to the proposal, one facility providedinformation that indicated that K073 wastes are still being generated.Since the basis for the proposed treatment standard was then consideredinvalid, the Agency did not promulgate the standard. The facility alsoindicated that the K073 wastes that were generated were also being incinerated.At this time, the Agency has not received any analytical data on the incinerationof these wastes. Since the facility appears to be the only generator ofK073 wastes and has also notified the Agency that it anticipates that itwill cease generation prior to May 8, 1990 (due to a change in their productionprocess), additional options that the Agency is considering for K073 nonwastewatersis to allow the ``hard hammer'' provisions to become effective or to reproposethe ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation''. The Agency specificallysolicits comment on these approaches. <T3>4. K031, K084, K101, and K102. </T3>The Agency has determined thatK031, K084 and K101/K102 (High Arsenic Subcategory) wastes represent onetreatability group. Problems with establishing BDAT and treatment standardsfor these First Third wastes are based on the relatively high concentrationsof arsenic in these wastes and the difficulties in treatment due to thetoxicity and unique chemistry of arsenic. Arsenic presents particular treatmentproblems due to its nonmetallic behavior and its tendency to exist in thesewastes as oxo-anions (ionic complexes containing oxygen and arsenic withan overall negative charge, such as arsenite and arsenate) and as organo-arsenicalcomplexes. Metals typically exist in wastes as soluble cationic species(single metallic ions with a positive charge). The Agency attempted stabilization of K031 wastes using Portland cement.The resultant data indicated that the leachability of arsenic from thetreated residues increased by orders of magnitude over the leachabilityfrom the untreated wastes. Typically, chemical stabilization of sludgescontaining metals is partly based on the ability of the alkaline cementitiousreagents to chemically bind the cationic metal species. The Agency believesthat the increase in leachability of arsenic after stabilization is probablydue to the increased solubility of various forms of arsenic at higher pH.In addition, this increase in leachability seems to be indicating thatthe arsenic is not being chemically bound by the stabilization reagents.Several alternatives to cementitious stabilization for arsenical wastesare currently under consideration by the Agency including vitrificationor molten glass stabilization, the use of red clays containing aluminaas additives to the stabilization process, and the use of other noncementitiousproprietary binders for stabilization. The Agency is currently planningon conducting stabilization tests for certain arsenic wastes. However atthis time, it has not established which wastes or which processes willbe studied. The Agency is therefore, soliciting comments and data on thesestabilization techniques for arsenic and is particularly interested indata for wastes (solid or liquid) with arsenic concentrations greater than1% (by weight) as well as data for those wastes that are known to containorgano-arsenicals.For K084, K101 and K102 nonwastewaters, incineration followed by ash stabilizationwas originally identified as an applicable technology due to the high organiccontent of these wastes. Analyses of the wastes during sampling indicatedthat these wastes contained concentrations of total arsenic exceeding 1%by weight. Due to concerns over safe handling and potential air emissionproblems, the Agency did not continue performance testing of incinerationof these high arsenic wastes. Other K101 and K102 wastes containing lessthan 1% arsenic were safely incinerated by EPA using specialized air pollutioncontrol devices, such as electrostatic precipitators or high efficiencywet scrubbers. Based on this testing, treatment standards for K101 andK102 wastes containing less than l% total arsenic were promulgated on August8, 1988. The Agency believes that incineration remains a viable treatmentalternative for organo-arsenical wastes and organic wastes contaminatedwith inorganic arsenic for wastes with total arsenic concentrations under1%. For K084, K101, K102 and similar organo-arsenic wastes with greater than1% total arsenic (e.g., P036, P038, U136 and some D004 wastes), EPA isalso considering other organic destruction techniques such as chemicaloxidation followed by stabilization of the inorganic residues. The Agencyis requesting comments as to the applicability of these technologies toorgano-arsenical wastes. In establishing wastewater treatment standards for these arsenic wastes,the Agency believes that it must consider the physical and chemical stateof the arsenic in the wastewater treatment residue and not just the efficiencyof removal of the arsenic from the wastewater. Wastewater treatment formost metals is typically based on precipitation with anionic species suchas hydroxide, sulfide, carbonate, phosphate or sometimes sulfate. Solublearsenic species have been reported to be removed from wastewaters by usinglime (calcium hydroxide) as a precipitant. However, lime precipitationfor arsenic involves precipitation as a calcium salt rather than as a hydroxide(as with most other metals). Sulfide ``precipitation'' using sodium sulfide or hydrogen sulfide as reagentshas also been reported to be partially effective for the treatment of wastewaterscontaining arsenic in the form of arsenates, but relatively ineffectivefor arsenites. This treatment is believed to be the result of a chemicalreaction of the arsenate anions with the sulfide anions resulting in theconversion of arsenic in the arsenate form to a relatively insoluble arsenicsulfide. While removal of arsenic with lime may be utilized for wastewaters,the reaction with sulfide and subsequent conversion to arsenic sulfideshould result in a precipitate that is less soluble in water than the calciumsalt (Calcium arsenate is slightly soluble in water, while arsenic sulfideis practically insoluble in water). However, while arsenic sulfide is insolublein water under acid conditions, information appears to indicate that theleachability (or solubility) of the arsenic sulfide increases under alkalineconditions. At this time, the Agency has not completed its evaluation ofthe environmental benefits and/or trade-offs of requiring arsenic to beremoved from wastewaters as a sulfide, as a calcium salt, or using somecombination of both. The increase in removal efficiency with sulfide precipitationmust be balanced against the potential for increased leachability underalkaline conditions. This increased leachability is a valid concern, inthat, many operators of hazardous landfills may co-dispose all ``metal''wastes and typical procedures are to add excess lime to prevent migrationof the other metals. One possible solution to this problem is for the Agencyto establish special requirements for the disposal of arsenic wastes asa type of incompatible waste. The Agency is specifically soliciting commentsand data on all of these issues for arsenic wastes.In studying the generation of K084 wastes, the Agency obtained informationthat suggests that some organo-arsenical compounds can be precipitatedfrom wastewaters by simply increasing the pH due to variation in solubilitieswith pH. The Agency recognizes that this procedure may be effective forremoval of the organo-arsenicals and perhaps certain additional inorganicarsenic complexes from wastewater. However, since this treatment generatesa nonwastewater residue (K084) that contains high organics and high arsenic,the Agency is concerned that the treatment process has created a residualfor which further treatment has not yet been identified (i.e., incinerationmay be considered risky and stabilization may be ineffective for the organo-arsenicals).The Agency believes that one possible solution to this problem is for thefacility to change the treatment process for the wastewaters by addinga chemical oxidation step that can effectively break the organo-arsenicalbonds and thereby convert the organo-arsenicals to inorganic forms thatmay be effectively treated by specialized stabilization processes or possiblyrecovered. The Agency is also considering high temperature metals recovery of arsenicwastes as well as other recovery processes, as alternatives to land disposal.Some of the wastes contain up to 26% arsenic indicating a high potentialfor recovery and reuse. High temperature metals recovery would probablyrequire air pollution control devices, such as electrostatic precipitatorsor high efficiency wet scrubbers, on the recovery processes. This technologycan be theoretically applicable to either organic or inorganic wastes containingarsenic. One problem with this approach is that the Agency has not beenable to identify an existing high temperature metals recovery facilityin the United States that can technically recover arsenic and is commerciallyavailable. The Agency also considered ion exchange as a potential recoveryprocess for arsenic contaminated wastewaters. However, typical ion exchangerecovery of metals is geared to recovery of cationic metal species. TheAgency has not been able to identify any specific ion exchange technologydesigned to recover arsenic. The Agency solicits comments and data on thefeasibility and/or effectiveness of recovery of arsenic from either wastewatersor nonwastewaters. 5. <T3>K035 and K083.</T3> The Agency believes that K035 and K083 wastes typicallycontain sufficient concentrations of organics with sufficient fuel contentthat these wastes can be used as fuel substitutes. A treatment standardfor K083 nonwastewaters was originally proposed as ``No Land Disposal Basedon Recycling''. The data available to the Agency indicated that some K083wastes could be burned in a boiler without generation of ash residues.One commenter to the proposed standard responded that his facility wasgenerating a K083 waste that did generate ash residues. The Agency promulgatedthe proposed standard for only those K083 wastes that contained less than0.01% ash (i.e., the typical detection limit for ash content that infersthat the waste has ``no ash'').To date, no additional data on the K083 wastes that contain greater than0.01% ash, have been submitted to the Agency by the facility. If data andinformation on this ash is not obtained by the Agency in time for proposalwith the Third Third wastes, the Agency intends to propose a treatmentstandard for these K083 nonwastewaters by transferring performance datafrom the incineration of other wastes such as K001, K022, K087 and/or K103/K104.Wastewater standards may be proposed based on an analysis of the respectivescrubber waters generated from incineration of these wastes or based ona transfer of wastewater treatment data from the NPDES program.In a similar manner, the Agency intends to propose standards for K035 wastesbased on a transfer of the same data. Currently, the Agency is gatheringwaste characterization data on K035 wastes in order to establish the applicabilityof transferring performance data from these wastes. There is also a possibilitythat K035 wastes are no longer generated. The Agency specifically solicitscomments on the approach of establishing a treatment standard for K035nonwastewaters (as generated) of ``No Land Disposal Based on No Generation''.6. <T3>K046.</T3> Treatment standards based on solidification for K046 wastesin the Nonreactive Subcategory were promulgated by the Agency on August8, 1988. The Agency is currently evaluating options for the treatment ofthe Reactive Subcategory of K046 wastes. The reactivity of these wastesis due to the presence of chemical constituents that can be explosive incertain situations. The typical treatment process for explosive wastesis either open detonation or specialized incineration. One of the problems with open detonation of these reactive K046 wastesis that the waste contains significant concentrations of lead. During opendetonation, this lead is released to the environment and typically contaminatesthe ground surrounding the open detonation site. One option that has beensuggested by industry, is to allow open detonation followed by solidificationof the surrounding soil, depending on the leachability of the lead fromthe soil. The Agency believes that development of numerical treatment standardsbased on open detonation appears to be a difficult process due to potentialproblems in developing analytical requirements for the surrounding soils,such as the frequency and location for sampling. Incineration of K046 wastes in the Reactive Subcategory may also be applicable.However, this would require incineration units that are specially designedand fitted with certain explosion proof equipment. These type of unitsare not typically found at commercial incineration facilities. Currently,the Agency has not identified any information on the incineration of K046wastes. While incineration appears to be a feasible option, the Agencyis currently considering the performance of chemical deactivation processesfor development of a treatment standard for these wastes. The Agency notesthat it is unlikely that incineration in these specialized units wouldbe precluded from use by the establishment of a standard based on chemicaldeactivation.Chemical deactivation of the explosive constituents in the K046 wastesappears to be a potentially useful step in the development of treatmentstandards. Chemical deactivation is essentially a controlled chemical reactionthat destroys the explosive constituents through oxidation/reduction processesthereby rendering the waste nonreactive. One problem with considering thisprocess as BDAT is that the deactivation may have to take place prior tothe generation of the K046, because K046 is listed as a wastewater treatmentresidue. However, if these wastes can technically be generated as nonreactive(i.e., not explosive), the Agency believes that a standard for K046 wastesin the Reactive Subcategory may not even be necessary. In considering thisapproach, the Agency may propose a ``No Land Disposal Based on Deactivation''standard for these K046 wastes thereby forcing generators to deactivatetheir wastewaters prior to generation of a wastewater treatment residue(i.e., a K046 waste in the Nonreactive Subcategory). By establishing thestandard of ``No Land Disposal Based on Deactivation'' for the ReactiveSubcategory, the Agency believes that a variance from this standard couldthen be considered for wastes that for some reason could not be effectivelydeactivated. As an alternative, the Agency may simply propose the existinglead standard based on solidification for K046 Nonreactive Subcategoryfor the K046 Reactive Subcategory. The Agency is soliciting comments and data on the physical and chemicalcharacterization of K046 wastes in the Reactive Subcategory as well ason the applicability of chemical deactivation to these wastes. Facilitieswith wastes in this subcategory that are not amenable to deactivation techniquesshould submit data and information on the characteristics of these wastesand the technical justification for why they are not amenable to chemicaldeactivation. 7. <T3>K069.</T3> A treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Based on Recycling''was originally proposed for all K069 wastes. One commenter responded thathis facility generates a K069 waste that was not recyclable due to thesignificantly lower concentrations of lead (the constituent being recovered).Information supplied on the waste characteristics and the generation procedureconfirmed that there is a significant difference between these wastes andthat two treatability subcategories were necessary for these wastes. TheAgency identified the commenter's waste as a K069 nonwastewater in theCalcium Sulfate Subcategory and did not promulgate the proposed treatmentstandard for that Subcategory. However, the proposed standard was promulgatedfor all other K069 nonwastewaters. The Agency identified these wastes asthe Non Calcium Sulfate Subcategory of K069 nonwastewaters.To date, no other facility has been identified as generating K069 nonwastewatersin the Calcium Sulfate Subcategory and the Agency is considering developinga treatment standard based on waste characterization data supplied by thisfacility. While EPA has not obtained any specific treatment data on thisparticular waste, it intends to propose numerical treatment standards basedon a transfer of solidification data for another hazardous waste knownto contain hazardous constituents similar to this subcategory of K069.In a similar manner, the Agency intends to transfer treatment standardsfor metals for K069 wastewaters for both subcategories. The data on generation of the K069 wastes in the Calcium Sulfate Subcategoryindicated that during the generation of this waste, excess lime is addedto the K069 as it is being generated. This excess lime is expected to actas a stabilizing agent, with the resulting waste exhibiting a lower leachabilitythan would be expected from a waste which was generated without the additionof excess lime. Characterization data of this waste also indicated a highlevel of sulfates in the waste. Sulfates have been identified by the Agencyas a waste characteristic which affects treatment performance of some solidificationprocesses. The data which the Agency is currently considering as potentiallytransferable contain relatively low concentrations of sulfates. However,transferring any of the existing solidification performance data to theseK069 wastes is expected to result in a treatment standard that the Agencybelieves may be achievable simply by the current practice of addition ofexcess lime during generation. 8. <T3>K085</T3>. Treatment standards for K085 wastes were not proposed withthe First Third wastes, because difficulties arose in the planned incinerationof the waste. The Agency collected waste characterization data for K085nonwastewaters that indicated the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls(PCBs) in concentrations greater than 50 ppm. The Toxic Substances ControlAct (TSCA) requires that incineration of wastes with greater than 50 ppmof PCBs be performed at a facility that is specifically permitted underTSCA for incineration of PCBs. Incineration at an approved facility couldnot be arranged in time for proposal of treatment standards with the FirstThird wastes.Since that time, EPA has identified existing data obtained by the Agency'sOffice of Toxic Substances (OTS) on the incineration of transformer fluidscontaining PCBs at a facility that also incinerates K085 wastes. Sincetransformer fluids were often comprised of a blend of concentrated PCBswith a mixture of chlorobenzenes, the Agency anticipates that this datawill be useful in establishing numerical treatment standards for all chlorobenzenecompounds and wastes from chlorobenzene production. This information iscurrently considered TSCA confidential business information (CBI) and appropriateTSCA clearance procedures must be followed prior to use of this data forRCRA regulations. This data was not available in time for development oftreatment standards for K085 wastes for proposal with the Second Thirdwastes. It is not clear whether this data will be available for proposaleven with the Third Third.The Agency believes that, as generated, K085 wastes are nonwastewatersthat are most likely already regulated by the California List prohibitionon Halogenated Organic Compounds (HOCs). However, this prohibition onlyestablished incineration as a method of treating HOCs and did not establishnumerical treatment standards for particular halogenated organic constituents.Because of the restrictions on land disposal of HOCs, the Agency anticipatesthat K085 wastes are currently being incinerated and is hereby solicitingdata generated from this incineration that may aid in the development oftreatment standards for these wastes. <T3>9. K086</T3>. Treatment standards for wastewater and nonwastewaterforms of K086 in the Solvent Washes Subcategory were promulgated with theFirst Thirds. No standards were proposed or promulgated for all other K086wastes. These include wastes in the Solvent Sludges Subcategory and theCaustic/Water Washes and Sludges Subcategory. Performance data on the treatment of K086 wastes in the Caustic and WaterWash Subcategory are currently being developed by the Agency's Office ofResearch and Development. EPA expects to promulgate treatment standardsfor the remaining K086 waste subcategories prior to May 8, 1990 based onthis and other data available. If complications arise in the use of thisdata, the Agency may propose to transfer some or all of the existing K086standards to the other K086 Subcategories.<T3>10. K106</T3>. Treatment standards for K106 nonwastewaters have previouslybeen proposed based on a recycling/recovery technique (retorting) for therecovery of mercury (the primary hazardous constituent). This standardwas not promulgated because, at the time, there was insufficient informationto transfer the standard for K106 from mercury sulfide ores and other mercurywastes that the Agency believed were similar to the K106 wastes. At thetime of today's proposal, the Agency has not completed its evaluation ofretorting for K106 wastes. However, the Agency still believes that retortingis a viable option for developing treatment standards for K106 nonwastewaters.Retorting of ores typically involves roasting the mercury sulfide oresat elevated temperatures in the presence of oxygen. This roasting convertsthe mercury salts to elemental mercury. The mercury is vaporized, sweptfrom the retort in the off-gases, and subsequently condensed for laterreuse. Retorting has been demonstrated on other wastes with greater than1% total mercury. A number of K106 generators currently operate mercuryretorts on-site for various other wastes that contain mercury. At leastone facility is retorting a K106 waste. However, this K106 is significantlydifferent from other K106 wastes, in that it is being generated as elementalmercury. The Agency encountered problems during analysis of the possible alternativetreatment options for K106. These problems were primarily the result ofthe apparent inability of typical cementitious stabilization techniquesto reduce the leachability of mercury. The Agency attempted stabilizationof K106 wastes using Portland cement, lime and fly ash, and kiln dust.The resultant data indicated that the leachability of mercury in the treatedresidues increased by orders of magnitude over the leachability in theuntreated wastes. The Agency believes that the increase in leachabilityof mercury after stabilization is probably due to the increased solubilityof mercury sulfide at higher pH. In addition, this increase in leachabilitymay be indicating that the mercury is not being chemically bound by thestabilization reagents. Alternatives to cementitious stabilization formercury wastes currently under consideration include the use of other proprietarybinders such as silicates and sulfides. The Agency is soliciting commentsand data on stabilization techniques for mercury and is particularly interestedin data for wastes (solid or liquid) with mercury concentrations higherthan 1%.Sulfide precipitation has been identified as the most likely candidatefor BDAT for K106 wastewaters. This process involves the conversion ofsoluble mercury to a relatively insoluble mercury sulfide. Elemental mercuryis slightly soluble in water, while mercury sulfide is practically insolublein water. While filtration of elemental mercury can be effective for wastewaters,the reaction with sulfide and subsequent conversion to mercuric sulfideshould result in a precipitate that is less soluble in water than the residualcontaining elemental mercury. However, elemental mercury is more amenableto simple retort operations than a mercury sulfide filter cake, becauseoxygen is not required to roast the elemental mercury, and additional airpollution control devices are not required to remove the sulfur dioxidegenerated from sulfide roasting. In addition, while mercuric sulfide is insoluble in water under acid conditions,information appears to indicate that the leachability (or solubility) ofthe mercuric sulfide may increase under alkaline conditions. At this time,the Agency has not completed its evaluation of the environmental benefitsand/or trade-offs of requiring mercury to be removed from wastewaters asa sulfide or as elemental mercury. The increase in removal efficiency withsulfide precipitation must be balanced against the potential for increasedleachability under alkaline conditions and a waste which is more difficultto recover. This increased leachability is a valid concern, in that manyoperators of hazardous landfills dispose of all ``metal'' wastes together,and typically add excess lime to prevent migration of the other metals.One possible solution to this problem is for the Agency to establish specialrequirements for the disposal of mercury wastes. The Agency is specificallysoliciting comments and data on all of these issues for mercury wastes.Along with investigating the appropriateness of transferring existing performancedata, the Agency intends to investigate chemical reduction of wastewatersfollowed by retorting of the filtration residuals containing elementalmercury (K106), and/or retorting of other concentrated mercury wastes.<T3>b. Third Third Wastes</T3>. In section III.A.8.f. of today's preamble,the Agency is proposing treatment standards for both wastewater and nonwastewaterforms of K023, K093, and K094 based on a transfer of incineration datafor K024 wastes. In section III.A.8.c. of today's preamble, the Agencyis proposing treatment standards for the nonwastewater forms of K002, K003,K005, K006, and K007. All of these wastes are Third Third wastes that werenot originally scheduled to be promulgated until May 8, 1990. However,the statute does not preclude EPA from prohibiting the land disposal ofa given waste ahead of schedule and in fact compels the Agency to prohibitthe land disposal of hazardous wastes as soon as possible.The following discussion is a synopsis of the approaches and options thatthe Agency is considering for establishing BDAT treatment standards forall remaining Third Third ``K'' wastes. The Agency is specifically solicitingcomments on the approach to develop treatment standards for each of theindividual wastes or treatability groups. While no treatment standardsare proposed for these wastes in today's rule, the Agency does anticipateproposing standards for them on the schedule for development of the ThirdThirds. No treatment standards are proposed in today's rule for the wastewaterforms of K002, K003, K005, K006, and K007. These wastewaters are anticipatedto contain metals and possibly cyanides. The Agency is currently evaluatingthe possibility of transferring treatment performance data for these wastewatersbased on chromium reduction, cyanide destruction, and metals precipitation/stabilizationusing existing data. K026 nonwastewaters are expected to contain various concentrations of organo-nitrogencompounds (e.g., methyl ethyl pyridines). Numerical treatment standardsare anticipated to be developed and proposed based on a transfer of treatmentdata (primarily incineration data) for compounds such as acetonitrile,nitrobenzenes, nitroanilines, and pyridine from wastes such as F003, F005,K011, K013, K014, K103, or K104. K032, K033, and K034 are all wastes from the production of the halogenatedmultiple component pesticide, Chlordane. Numerical treatment standardsare anticipated to be developed and proposed based on a transfer of treatmentdata (primarily incineration data) for mixtures such as Toxaphene and PCBsfrom wastes such as K041, K097, K098, P123, and U036. EPA has data that suggest some K026, K032, K033, and K034 wastes may nolonger be generated. The Agency is also considering the proposal of ``NoLand Disposal Based on No Generation'' for certain nonwastewater formsof these four wastes. A treatment standard of ``No Land Disposal Basedon No Generation'' was promulgated on August 8, 1988 for the nonwastewaterforms of K100. While no BDAT standards were proposed or promulgated forthe wastewater forms of K100, the soft hammer provisions did not applyto these wastes because they were originally scheduled with the Third Thirdwastes. Wastewater treatment standards for K100 are anticipated to be developedsimilar to the wastewater standards for K069, because K100 was listed asa waste leaching solution from the acid leaching of K069 wastes.B. ``Soft Hammer'' Applicable Treatment Standards The Agency has not promulgated treatment standards for the First Thirdand Second Third wastes in Tables B.(a) and B.(b). RCRA section 3004(g)(6)provides that if EPA fails to set treatment standards for any hazardouswaste included in the schedule promulgated on May 28, 1986 (51 FR 19300)by the August 8, 1988 or June 8, 1989 statutory deadlines, such waste maybe land disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment only if the unitmeets certain statutory requirements and only if the generator makes certaincertifications. These requirements have been termed the ``soft hammer''provisions (see 53 FR 31179-31186, August 17, l988). If the Agency hasnot set treatment standards for any hazardous waste by May 8 1990, suchwaste is absolutely prohibited from all forms of land disposal unless a``no migration'' petition has been granted. EPA has identified several treatment technologies that are generally consideredappropriate for the nonwastewater forms of these wastes. These technologiesinclude: metal recovery, leaching/oxidation, metals stabilization, ashstabilization, chemical oxidation, biodegradation, incineration, PCB incineration,and open detonation/open burning. Treatment technologies generally consideredappropriate for the wastewater forms of these wastes include: aqueous metalrecovery, chromium reduction, metals precipitation, steam stripping, carbonadsorption, oxidation/reduction, chemical oxidation, biodegradation, incineration,and PCB incineration. The Agency is amending andSection; 268.12 to includewastewater residues derived from the treatment of ``soft hammer'' wastesby certain processes, as well as leachate derived from the management of``soft hammer'' wastes and ``soft hammer'' waste-contaminated groundwater.This action will allow these wastewater residues to be disposed in unitsnot meeting minimum technological requirements and such resides will notbe subject to the certification requirements of andSection; 268.8.The technologies are listed as general categories of technologies thatEPA believes have a reasonable probability of application to the wastecodes listed. These categories do not specify any particular type of technology(e.g., incineration can represent liquid incinerators, rotary kiln, orfluidized bed incinerators). The actual choice of a particular technologyor even train of technologies depends on the physical and chemical characteristicsof the specific waste. Specific selection of one technology depends onits functional design. The Agency notes that many of these wastes, when existing as untreatedwastes, are already prohibited from land disposal because they are Californialist wastes. Several of the organic hazardous wastes undoubtedly exceedthe statutory levels for wastes containing halogenated organics (HOCs)and are thus subject to the HOC treatment standard. However, as was discussedin the August 17, 1988 final rule, treatment to comply with the Californialist prohibitions does not necessarily satisfy the ``soft hammer'' requirementsof 40 CFR 268.8 and, in fact, the California list prohibitions representthe minimum treatment required for such ``soft hammer'' wastes prior toland dispoal (53 FR 31187). This principle applies in all cases exceptwhen the California list waste is subject to a statutory prohibition (suchas California list metals). In the case of an overlap between a ``softhammer'' waste and a California list statutory prohibition, the ``softhammer'' provisions apply because they are potentially more protective.However, in no case may a waste be disposed of in excess of the Californialist prohibition levels. The following tables are presented as an aid to generators seeking appropriatetechnologies to treat ``soft hammer'' F- and K-listed wastes. Several technologiesare listed for each waste code, in descending order of preference. EPAnotes that certain technologies are only appropriate for certain constituenttypes and that more than one treatment technology may be required (if practicallyavailable) to treat the different constituents of concern in the waste.The Agency emphasizes that these tables are not to be considered as stricttreatment guidelines. In general, however, EPA will use these tables inevaluating the demonstrations and certifications received for these wastesand is providing this information to aid the generator in determining thebest practically available technology (if any) for treating his waste incompliance with andSection; 268.8.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table B.

Capacity Determinations<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Determination of Alternative Capacity and Effective Dates for SurfaceLand Disposed Wastes for Which Treatment Standards Are Proposed</ITAG><T3>a. Total Quantity of Land Disposed Wastes.</T3> The capacity analysesfor wastes for which EPA is today proposing treatment standards were performedusing the National Survey of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, Disposal,and Recycling Facilities (the TSDR Survey). EPA conducted the TSDR Surveyduring 1987 and early 1988 to obtain comprehensive data on hazardous wastemanagement capacity and on volumes of hazardous waste being land disposed.Survey data are part of the record for this proposed rule, and are obtainablefrom the Agency's contractor (Versar, Inc.).EPA estimated the total quantities of wastes addressed in today's proposalthat are land disposed annually based on the results of the TSDR Survey.The quantities of waste by land disposal method are presented in TableIII.C.1.(a). Some methods of land disposal, including utilization of saltdomes and salt bed formations and underground caves and mines, are notaddressed in the capacity analysis because of insufficient data on thetypes and volumes of wastes disposed by these methods.The TSDR survey indicated that about 1,695 million gallons of the wastesfor which standards are proposed today were land disposed in 1987. Thisincludes less than 1 million gallons that were disposed in surface impoundments,and will therefore require alternative treatment capacity. Approximately5 million gallons of the wastes addressed today were stored in surfaceimpoundments and 9 million were stored in waste piles. These stored wasteswill eventually be treated, recycled or permanently disposed in other units.To avoid double-counting, the volumes of wastes reported as being storedin surface impoundments or waste piles have not been included in the volumeof wastes requiring alternative treatment capacity. After the applicableprohibition effective date for any waste, placement of prohibited wastesin waste piles or surface impoundments for purposes of storage is prohibited.The 1987 TSDR Survey indicated that less than 1 million gallons per yearof wastes addressed today were treated annually in surface impoundmentsthat do not meet the minimum technology requirements. This amount shouldnow be considerably less (indeed, zero) since the November 8, 1988 deadlinefor retrofitting surface impoundments has passed. The Agency assumes thatthis volume of waste is now being sent off-site for treatment. Therefore,this amount is included as treatment capacity required in today's proposedrule.In addition, 6 million gallons are treated in waste piles, 17 million gallonsare disposed in land treatment units or landfills, and 1,657 million gallonsare underground injected; all of these wastes will require alternativetreatment capacity.<T3>b. Required Alternative Capacity for Surface Land Disposed Wastes.</T3>The Agency assessed the requirements resulting from today's proposal foralternative treatment capacity for land disposed wastes other than thosewhich are underground injected. EPA first characterized the volumes ofwastes for which treatment standards are being proposed, since these wastesrequire alternative treatment. Waste streams were characterized on thebasis of land disposal method, waste code, and physical/chemical form.Using this information, the Agency determined which treatment technologiesare applicable to the waste volumes and placed the wastes into treatabilitygroups. The volumes of alternative treatment capacity that would be requiredwhen owners or operators comply with the land disposal restrictions beingpromulgated were then determined. Based on this analysis, the Agency estimatesthat today's rule could affect about 1,695 million gallons of wastes thatare land disposed annually. Of this total, about 1,683 million gallonswill require alternative treatment capacity, the remainder being stored.Wastes which are underground injected account for 1,657 million gallons.Determinations of alternative capacity and effective dates for these wastesare presented separately, following the discussion of surface land-disposedwastes. As explained elsewhere in this preamble, EPA is, with limited exceptions,proposing treatment standards expressed as concentration limits based onthe performance of the Best Demonstrated Available Technology (BDAT). WhereEPA promulgates a performance standard rather than a method as the treatmentstandard, it is not required that the BDAT be used to achieve the concentrationlevels. However, the BDAT technologies, as described in Section III.A.,were used as the basis for determining available capacity. The volumes of surface land-disposed wastes that require alternative treatment/recyclingcapacity are presented in Table III.C.1.(b). This table includes only thequantities of wastes that require alternative commercial capacity; thevolumes given do not include wastes that can be treated on-site by thegenerator. The Agency has included only BDAT treatment in its assessmentof both off-site and on-site capacity. EPA develops BDAT such that a well-designedand well-operated treatment process should be capable of complying withthe standards. <T3>c. Capacity Currently Available and Effective Dates. </T3>Table III.C.1.(a)presents the volumes of wastes that require alternative treatment capacity,arranged according to the technology description of the alternative treatmentrequired. The amount of capacity that is available in each case is alsopresented. Available capacity at commercial facilities was determined usingthe TSDR Survey. The available capacity presented below is the estimatedcapacity available prior to promulgation of this rule after subtractingthe capacity required for surface land-disposed solvent wastes, surfacedisposed California List Halogenated Organic Compound (HOC) wastes, andsurface disposed First Third wastes previously restricted from land disposal.It is important to note that some of these wastes, because of their actualphysical form, cannot meet treatment standards simply by using the technologyidentified as BDAT. These wastes must be treated through several steps,called a treatment train. The Agency assumed that the residuals in suchcases will be treated using alternative technologies prior to land disposal;therefore, the total volumes reported were assigned to appropriate technologies.<T3>Wastewater Treatment. </T3>Treatment standards proposed for cyanide-containingwastes F007, F008, F009, F011, P013, P021, P029, P030, P074, P098, P099,P104, P106, and P121 are based on wet air oxidation. The Agency has alsoidentified alkaline chlorination followed by chemical precipitation asa technology which can be used to meet the treatment standard. For F006,F012, and F019, electrolytic oxidation followed by alkaline chlorinationhas been identified as BDAT. The treatment standards for metals in treatmentresiduals are based on stabilization. The Agency estimates that 5.0 milliongallons per year of these wastes which have been surface land-disposedwill require cyanide treatment as a result of today's proposed treatmentstandards. After analyzing the new TSDR Survey data, the Agency has determined thatsufficient commercial capacity does exist for the remainder of these wastes(5 million gallons). Therefore, the Agency is not proposing to grant anational capacity extension for these wastes that are surface land disposed.In the First Third Final Rule, the Agency set treatment standards for themetals in F006 nonwastewaters based on stabilization. In today's proposedrule, the Agency is proposing treatment standards for cyanides in F006nonwastewaters based on the transfer of the proposed treatment standardsfor F012 nonwastewaters. The Agency believes that a pretreatment step todestroy the cyanides should be done before stabilization. In the First Third Final Rule, the Agency estimated that 129 million gallonsof F006 wastes would require alternative treatment. The Agency believesthat these wastes are currently being pretreated for cyanides. Therefore,no additional capacity is believed to be required for F006 nonwastewatersbecause of today's proposed cyanide standards and a capacity variance isnot being proposed. <T3>Wastewater Treatment/Incineration. </T3> The treatment standards proposedfor F010 wastes are based on incineration of the wastes with greater than5% organics. The Agency estimates that andless;1 million gallons per yearof F010 wastes will require incineration as a result of today's proposedrule. After analyzing the TSDR Survey data, the Agency has determined that thereis enough treatment capacity commercially available to incinerate the entirevolume of F010 waste requiring alternative treatment. Therefore, the Agencyis not proposing to grant a capacity extension to F010 wastes. Treatmentstandards proposed for K009 and K010 are based on incineration for nonwastewatersand, for wastewaters, steam stripping, biological treatment or steam strippingfollowed by biological treatment. The treatment standards for metals intreatment residuals are based on stabilization. Treatment standards proposed for K011, K013, and K014 wastes are basedon incineration followed by stabilization of residuals for nonwastewaters,and on wet air oxidation followed by biological treatment for wastewaters.These wastes will require incineration or wastewater treatment as a resultof today's proposed treatment standards. After analyzing the new TSDR Survey data, the Agency has determined thatthere is enough commercial incineration capacity available to treat theandless;1 million gallons of nonwastewater K011, K013, and K014 that is notunderground injected. Therefore, the Agency is not proposing to grant anational capacity extension for K011, K013, and K014 wastes that are surfaceland-disposed. For K027, K039, K113-K116, P040, P041, P043, P044, P062, P085, P109, P111,U058, U087, U221, and U223 wastes, the Agency is proposing to specify incinerationas a method of treatment for nonwastewaters, and carbon adsorption as amethod of treatment for wastewaters rather than developing numerical standards.Based on TSDR Survey data, the Agency estimates that 8 million gallonsper year of surface land-disposed nonwastewaters will require incinerationas a result of today's proposed treatment standards. No wastewaters wereidentified as requiring alternative treatment. After analyzing the TSDR Survey data, the Agency has determined that thereis enough commercial capacity available to treat the K027, K039, K113-K116,P040, P041, P043, P044, P062, P085, P109, P111, U058, U087, U221, and U223wastes requiring alternative treatment. Therefore, the Agency is not proposingto grant a capacity extension for surface land disposal of these wastes.<T3>No Land Disposal. </T3>The Agency is proposing a treatment standardof ``no land disposal'' for K005, K007, and K029 nonwastewaters, basedon the belief that these wastes are no longer being generated. At thistime, the Agency is not proposing treatment standards for the wastewaterforms of K005, K007, and K029. The Agency may develop standards for thesewastes prior to May 8, 1990 if there is an identified need for such standards.The Agency is proposing a treatment standard of ``no land disposal'' forK002, K003, K004, K006, K008, K095, and K096 nonwastewaters, based on thebelief that these wastes can be totally recycled. The Agency has obtainedinformation for K002, K003, and K006 indicating that several facilitiesare selling mixtures of these wastes, recyling them back to the productionprocess, or sending them to secondary lead smelting facilities for metalsrecovery. The Agency believes that these types of recycling and/or recoverytechniques can be used for all K002, K003, and K006 nonwastewaters. TheAgency estimates that a maximum of 1 million gallons per year of K002,K003, and K006 nonwastewaters may require commercial secondary lead smelting.Adequate capacity exists for this volume of waste; therefore, a capacityextension is not being proposed for nonwastewaters. The Agency is basing the proposed treatment standard of ``no land disposal''for K004, K008, K095 and K096 nonwastewaters on information obtained duringBDAT sampling. The TSDR Survey indicates small volumes of K004 and K008were reported to be land disposed in 1986. However, data obtained duringthe BDAT sampling visits indicates that these wastes now are being totallyrecycled; therefore, no alternative capacity is required and a capacityextension is not proposed. At this time, the Agency is not proposing treatment standards for the wastewaterforms of these wastes. The Agency may develop standards for K002, K003,K006, K095, and K096 wastewaters prior to May 8, 1990, if there is an identifiedneed for such standards. Since K004 and K008 wastewaters are First Thirdwastes, their land disposal will continue to be restricted by the ``softhammer'' provisions. <T3>Incineration. </T3>Treatment standards proposed for F024, K023, K028,K036 wastewaters, K038, K040, K043, K093 K094, P039, P071, P089, P094,P097, U028, U069, U088, U102, U107, U190, and U235 are based on incineration.The treatment standards for metals in residuals from treatment of F024and K028 are based on stabilization. The treatment standards proposed for F024 and K043 are based on incinerationperformance data; the treatment standards proposed for K028 are based onthe transfer of the incineration standards from F024; the treatment standardsproposed for K036 wastewaters, K038, K040, P039, P071, P089, P094, P097,and U235 are based on the transfer of the incineration standards from K037;and the treatment standards proposed for K023, K093, K094, U028, U069,U088, U102, U107, and U190 are based on the transfer of the incinerationstandards from K024.The Agency estimates the andless;1 million gallons of these wastes will requireincineration as a result of today's proposed treatment standards. Afteranalyzing the TSDR Survey data, the Agency has determined that there isenough incineration capacity commercially available to treat these wastes.Therefore, the Agency does not propose to grant a capacity extension forthese wastes. <T3>Wastes for Which Standards are Not Being Proposed. </T3>For today'sproposed rule, the Agency is not proposing treatment standards for K025wastewaters (treatment standards for nonwastewater K025 were promulgatedin the First Third final rule), K041, K042, K097, K098, and K105. Thesewastes will be restricted from land disposal under the ``soft hammer''provisions. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,7</C><T4>Table III.C.1.(a)._Volume of Land Disposed Wastes for Which

Contaminated Soil and Debris Capacity Variance</ITAG>In today's rule, the Agency is granting a national capacity variance forcertain contaminated soils for which treatment standards are based on incineration.For the purpose of determining whether a contaminated material is subjectto this national variance, soil is defined as materials that are primarilygeologic in origin such as silt, loam, or clay, and that are indigenousto the natural geological environment. In certain cases soils will be mixedwith liquids or sludges. As was explained in the preamble of the solventsand dioxins final rule, the Agency considers liquid- or sludge-containingwaste generated by a CERCLA response action, to be subject to the landdisposal restriction requirements (51 FR 40583). However, the Agency willdetermine on a case-by-case basis whether all or portions of such mixturesshould be considered soil or debris (51 FR 40577).Since the promulgation of the First Thirds rule, additional incinerationcapacity is believed to have become operational. The totals shown in TableIII.C.1.(c) reflect this added capacity. However, the increases are overwhelminglyin capacity to burn sludges mixed with other combustible liquids.Increases in rotary kiln incineration capacity_the type most appropriatefor soil and debris_have been relatively small. EPA believes that capacityis still inadequate for incineration of contaminated soil and debris. Therefore,a 2-year national capacity variance is proposed for soil and debris contaminatedwith wastes for which BDAT is incineration.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Capacity Determinations for Underground Injected Wastes</ITAG>The Agency is continuing to use a hierarchical approach in making decisionson adequacy of treatment capacity. As explained in previous preambles (52FR 32450, August 27, 1887 and 53 FR 30912, August 16, 1988), EPA is allocatingavailable capacity first to those wastes disposed in surface units, nextto wastes resulting from CERCLA and RCRA cleanups, and finally, to injectedwastes. Based on this approach, the Agency is proposing the following effectivedates for injected wastes.<T3>a. Effective Date Determinations for Scheduled Wastes for Which EPAHas Not Set Treatment Standards. </T3>The Agency has not proposed treatmentstandards for the wastes listed in Table III.C.3.(a) below. These wastesare not prohibited from land disposal by underground injection until theAgency sets treatment standards and effective dates, or until May 8, 1990.<T3>b. Scheduled Wastes With Proposed Treatment Standards Which CurrentData Indicate Are Not Being Injected. </T3>The wastes listed in Table III.C.3.(b)below are wastes for which standards are being proposed and which currentdata indicates are not being injected. Therefore, EPA is proposing thatthese wastes be prohibited from underground injection upon the date offinal promulgation of this rule. The Agency requests comment on whetherany of these wastes are being injected; if these wastes are injected, commentis requested on what quantities are being injected and what are their characteristics.The Agency is aware that leachate gathered from leachate collection systemsis frequently injected. Moreover, since a number of surface impoundmentshave recently stopped receiving hazardous wastes, those dilute wastes maybe diverted to injection wells. Both the leachate and any wastes injectedas a result of impoundments closing may contain wastes which have standardsestablished, but for which the Agency has no data indicating whether thewaste is injected. Therefore, the Agency has not evaluated whether a capacityextension is warranted. The Agency specifically requests comment on whethersuch wastes are injected, and on the quantities and characteristics ofthese wastes. Based on this data, the Agency may elect to promulgate theprohibition dates for injected wastes proposed today, or may establishnew dates for all or some of the wastes.EPA is proposing to set treatment standards for the nonwastewater componentsof K002 and K006, both Third Third wastes. The Agency has data indicatingthat these wastes are not being land disposed. EPA has not set BDAT forK002 or K006 wastewaters. These will remain Third Third wastes and willnot be subject to ``soft hammer'' provisions. EPA is soliciting furthercomment on the disposal of K002 and K006 in injection wells.<T3>c. Scheduled Wastes With Proposed Treatment Standards Which CurrentData Indicate Are Being Injected. </T3>Table III.C.3.(c) lists those wasteswith proposed treatment standards for which the Agency has data indicatingthat they are being injected underground. The Table summarizes the proposedeffective dates for the prohibitions against the underground injectionof wastes addressed in today's proposal. <T3>(1) Capacity Determinations for Wastes Requiring Wastewater Treatment.</T3>The treatment standards for F007, F008, F009, F011, F012, F019 wastes(wastes from electroplating and heat treating), P029 (cooper cyanides),P030 (soluble cyanide salts), P063 (hydrogen cyanide), and P098 (potassiumcyanide) wastes are based on wet air oxidation or on electrolytic oxidation,followed by alkaline chlorination. An estimated 132 million gallons peryear of these wastes will require cyanide wastewater treatment. Of the132 million gallons, approximately 127 million gallons are being disposedby underground injection. Table III.C.3.(c) gives the volumes of wastesinjected for the indicated waste codes. These wastes may be injected inindividual streams or as mixtures of wastes. By comparing the volumes of injected wastes with available commerical treatmentcapacity, the Agency has determined that there is inadequate wastewatertreatment capacity commerically available to treat the large volumes ofF007 wastes that are injected. Therefore, the Agency is proposing to granta national capacity extension for F007 wastes which are injected underground.Over 91 million gallons per year of available alternate commercial treatmentcapacity has been identified for the low volumes of F008, F009, F011, F012,F019, P029, P030, and P098 wastes injected; therefore, no capacity extensionsare proposed for these wastes. Since all of these are First Third wastes,the maximum extension available is to August 8, 1990 (see 51 FR 40573,November 7, 1986). P063 wastes are reported in the TSDR survey only as part of mixed wastestreams with K011, K013, and K014 wastes. When mixed waste streams arereported, but no breakdown of the volumes of the component wastes is given,the total volume is assumed to be divided equally among the components.This results in 174 million gallons being attributed to P063. The Agencybelieves that this is an extremely large volume for this waste code, andthat the actual volume of P063 is much lower. As a result, EPA is not proposingto grant a capacity extension to P063. However, the Agency solicits commenton the volumes and characteristics of any P063 wastes being injected. Anynew information will be evaluated and used in making a final determinationon the need for a capacity extension for this waste. <T3>(2) Capacity Determination for Injected Wastes Requiring Incineration.</T3>The treatment standards for P071 and P089 are based on the transferof the incineration standards for K037 waste. Phthalate wastes U028, U088,U107, and U190 have treatment standards based on the transfer of the incinerationstandards for K024 wastes. These wastes are currently injected in low volumes (see Table III.C.3.(c)),if at all. The Agency has determined that adequate treatment capacity existsfor these wastes. Table III.C.1.(c) indicates that over 216 million gallonsper year of commerical treatment capacity exists for liquid wastes requiringincineration. Therefore, no national capacity variances are proposed. Thesewastes will be banned from underground injection upon promulgation of thisrule unless comments and data received indicate that a capacity extensionis warranted. <T3>(3) Capacity Determination for Injected K009 and K010 Wastes. </T3>TheAgency is setting treatment standards for K009 and K010 based on incinerationfor nonwastewaters and biological treatment and/or steam stripping forwastewaters. The Agency has information indicating that approximately 54million gallons per year of each of these wastes are being injected. TableIII.C.1.(c) indicates that no alternate commercial treatment capacity isavailable for these wastes. The Agency is proposing to grant two-year nationalcapacity extensions for both K009 and K010 waste codes. Also, the Agencysolicits comment on whether additional volumes of K009 and K010 are beinginjected and, if so, the characteristics of those wastes. <T3>(4) Capacity Determination for Injected K011, K013, and K014 Wastes.</T3>A significant volume of K011, K013, and K014 (wastes from acrylonitrileproduction) are currently being land disposed by underground injection.Treatment standards are based on incineration for nonwastewater components,and wet air oxidation (followed by biological treatment) for wastewaters.The data indicate that neither adequate commercial incineration capacityfor injected K011, K013, and K014 nonwastewaters (approximately 290 milliongallons per year injected versus 76 million gallons of available commericaltreatment capacity) nor sufficient wet air oxidation capacity for the wastewaterK011, K013, and K014 (829 million gallons per year injected versus 91 milliongallons of available commerical treatment capacity) exists.  The Agency is, therefore, proposing to grant a national capacity extensionfor all K011, K013, and K014 wastes injected underground until August 8,1990. <T3>(5) Capacity Determination for Injected U221, U223, and P044 Wastes.</T3>Table III.C.3.(c) indicates that approximately 27 million gallonsper year of U221 wastes are being injected underground, and additionalvolumes of U223, and P044 wastes are being injected in mixed waste streams.Treatment standards are based on incineration for nonwastewater components,and on carbon adsorption for wastewaters. The data indicate that thereis adequate treatment capacity for both nonwastewaters and wastewaters(see Table III.C.1.(c)). No national capacity extensions are proposed forU221, U223, or P044 wastes. The Agency solicits comment on the volumesand characteristics of any of these wastes that are being injected.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table III.</T4>C.3.<T4>(a)</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Second Third Wastes For Which Treatment Standards Are Not Proposed]</ITAG><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">K019, K025, K029, K041, K042, K097, K098, K105</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P002, P003, P007, P014, P026, P027, P049, P054, P057, P060, P066, P067,P072, P107, P112, P113, P114</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> U002, U003, U005, U008, U011, U014, U015, U020, U021, U023, U025,U026, U032, U035, U047, U049, U057, U059, U060, U062, U070, U073, U080,U083, U092, U093, U094, U095, U097, U098, U099, U101, U106, U109, U110,U111, U112, U114, U116, U119, U127, U128, U131, U135, U138, U140, U143,U144, U146, U147, U149, U150, U161, U162, U163, U164, U165, U168, U169,U170, U172, U173, U174, U176, U178, U179, U189, U193, U196, U203, U205,U206, U208, U213, U214, U215, U216, U217, U218, U239, U244</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(0),i1,s25</C><T4>Table</T4> III.C.3.<T4>(b)</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastes for Which Treatment Standards Are Proposed Which Are </ITAG><T3>Not</T3> Underground Injected]<H1> </H1>FIRST THIRDF006, K004 (nonwastewaters), K036 (wastewaters) P039, P041, P094, P097SECOND THIRDf010, F024K027, K028, K029 (nonwastewaters), K038, K039, K040, K043 K095 (nonwastewaters), K096 (nonwastewaters)P040, P043, P062, P074, P085, P104, P106, P111U058, U235THIRD THIRDK002 (nonwastewaters), K003 (nonwastewaters)K005 (nonwastewaters), K006 (nonwastewaters)K007 (nonwastewaters), K023, K093, K094P021, P099, P109, P121U069, U087, U102NEWLY LISTED WASTESK113, K114, K115, K116</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s22,11.1</C>Table III.C.3.<T4>(c)</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Wastes With Treatment Standards Proposed Which </ITAG><T3>Are</T3> Being Underground Injected]<H1>Waste code</H1><H1>Volume of injected waste requiring treatment capacity</H1>FIRST THIRD<ITAG tagnum="1">F007<D>*127.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">F008<D>*andless;0.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">F009<D>*andless;0.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">F019<D>andless;0.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K011<D>*512.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K013<D>*486.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K014<D>*126.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P030<D>andless;0.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P063<D>184.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P071<D>andless;0.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P089<D>andless;0.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U221<D>26.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U223<D>*andless;0.1</D></ITAG>SECOND THIRD<ITAG tagnum="1">F011<D>*0.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">F012<D>*0.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K009<D>54.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K010<D>54.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P029<D>*andless;0.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P044<D>*0.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">P098<D>andless;0.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U028<D>*0.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U107<D>*0.0</D></ITAG>THIRD THIRD<ITAG tagnum="1">U088<D>*0.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">U190<D>*andless;0.1</D><F>*Indicate wastes are injected in mixed waste streams.

State Authority</ITAG>A. Applicability of Rules in Authorized StatesUnder section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administerand enforce the RCRA program within the State. Following authorization,EPA retains enforcement authority under sections 3008, 3013, and 7003 ofRCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement responsibility.The standards and requirements for authorization are found in 40 CFR Part271.Prior to HSWA, a State with final authorization administered its hazardouswaste program in lieu of EPA administering the Federal program in thatState. The Federal requirements no longer applied in the authorized State,and EPA could not issue permits for any facilities that the State was authorizedto permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgatedor enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority withinspecified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect inan authorized State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.In contrast, under RCRA section 3006(g) (42 U.S.C. 6926(g)), new requirementsand prohibitions imposed by HSWA take effect in authorized States at thesame time that they take effect in nonauthorized States. EPA is directedto carry out these requirements and prohibitions in authorized States,including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorizationto do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as Statelaw to retain final authorization, HSWA applies in authorized States inthe interim.Today's rule is proposed pursuant to sections 3004(d) through (k), and(m), of RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6924(d) through (k), and (m)). Therefore, it willbe added to Table 1 in 40 CFR 271.1(j), which identifies the Federal programrequirements that are promulgated pursuant to HSWA and take effect in allStates, regardless of their authorization status. States may apply foreither interim or final authorization for the HSWA provisions in Table1, as discussed in the following section. When this rule is promulgated,Table 2 in 40 CFR 271.1(j) will be modified also to indicate that thisrule is a self-implementing provision of HSWA.B. Effect on State AuthorizationsAs noted above, EPA will implement today's proposal in authorized Statesuntil their programs are modified to adopt these rules and the modificationis approved by EPA. Because the rule is proposed pursuant to HSWA, a Statesubmitting a program modification may apply to receive either interim orfinal authorization under RCRA section 3006(g)(2) or 3006(b), respectively,on the basis of requirements that are substantially equivalent or equivalentto EPA's. The procedures and schedule for State program modifications foreither interim or final authorization are described in 40 CFR 271.21. Itshould be noted that HSWA interim authorization will expire on January1 1993 (see 40 CFR 271.24(c)).Section 271.21(e)(2) requires that States that have final authorizationmust modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and mustsubsequently submit the modification to EPA for approval. The deadlineby which the State must modify its program to adopt this proposed regulationwill be determined by the promulgation of the final rule in accordancewith andSection; 271.21(e). These deadlines can be extended in certain cases(see andSection; 271.21(e)(3)). Once EPA approves the modification, the Staterequirements become Subtitle C RCRA requirements.States with authorized RCRA programs may already have requirements similarto those in today's proposal. These State regulations have not been assessedagainst the Federal regulations being proposed today to determine whetherthey meet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State is not authorizedto implement these requirements in lieu of EPA until the State programmodification is approved. Of course, States with existing standards maycontinue to administer and enforce their standards as a matter of Statelaw. In implementing the Federal program, EPA will work with States underagreements to minimize duplication of efforts. In many cases, EPA willbe able to defer to the States in their efforts to implement their programsrather than take separate actions under Federal authority.States that submit official applications for final authorization less than12 months after the effective date of these regulations are not requiredto include standards equivalent to these regulations in their application.However, the State must modify its program by the deadline set forth inandSection; 271.21(e). States that submit official applications for finalauthorization 12 months after the effective date of these regulations mustinclude standards equivalent to these regulations in their application.The requirements a state must meet when submitting its final authorizationapplication are set forth in 40 CFR 271.3.The amendments being proposed today need not affect the State's UndergroundInjection Control (UIC) primacy status. A State currently authorized toadminister the UIC program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) couldcontinue to do so without seeking authority to administer these amendments.However, a State which wished to implement Part 148 and receive authorizationto grant exemptions from the land disposal restrictions would have to demonstratethat it had the requiste authority to administer sections 3004(f) and (g)of RCRA. The conditions under which such an authorization may take placeare summarized below and are discussed in a July 15, 1985 final rule (50FR 28728). C. State ImplementationThe following four aspects of the framework established in the November7, 1986, rule (51 FR 40572) affect State implementation of today's proposaland impact State actions on the regulated community:1. Under Part 268, Subpart C, EPA is proposing land disposal restrictionsfor all generators, treaters, storers, and disposers of certain types ofhazardous waste. In order to retain authorization, States must adopt theregulations under this Subpart since State requirements can be no lessstringent than Federal requirements. 2. Also under Part 268, EPA is proposing to grant and rescind two-yearnational variances from the effective dates of the land disposal restrictionsbased on an analysis of available alternative treatment, recovery, or disposalcapacity. Under andSection; 268.5, case-by-case extensions of up to one year(renewable for one additional year) may be granted for specific applicantslacking adequate capacity. The Administrator of EPA is solely responsible for granting variances tothe effective dates because these determinations must be made on a nationalbasis. In addition, it is clear that RCRA section 3004(h)(3) intends forthe Administrator to grant case-by-case extensions after consulting theaffected States, on the basis of national concerns which only the Administratorcan evaluate. Therefore, States cannot be authorized for this aspect ofthe program. 3. Under andSection; 268.44, the Agency may grant waste-specific variancesfrom treatment standards in cases where it can be demonstrated that thephysical and/or chemical properties of the wastes differ significantlyfrom wastes analyzed in developing the treatment standards, and the wastescannot be treated to specified levels or treated by specified methods.The Agency is solely responsible for granting such variances since theresult of such an action may be the establishment of a new waste treatabilitygroup. All wastes meeting the criteria of these new waste treatabilitygroup may also be subject to the treatment standard established by thevariance. Granting such variances may have national impacts; therefore,this aspect of the program is not delegated to the States at this time.4. Under andSection; 268.6, EPA may grant petitions of specific durationto allow land disposal of certain hazardous wastes where it can be demonstratedthat there will be no migration of hazardous constitutents for as longas the waste remains hazardous. States which have the authority to imposerestrictions may be authorized under RCRA section 3006 to grant petitionsfor exemptions from the restrictions. Decisions on site-specific petitionsdo not require the national perspective required to restrict wastes orgrant extensions. EPA will be handling ``no migration'' petitions at Headquarters,though the States may be authorized to grant these petitions in the future.The Agency expects to gain valuable experience and information from reviewof ``no migration'' petitions which may affect future land disposal restrictionsrulemakings. In accordance with RCRA section 3004(i), EPA will publishnotice of the Agency's final decision on petitions in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.States are free to impose their own disposal restrictions if such actionsare more stringent or broader in scope than the actions of Federal programs(RCRA section 3009 and 40 CFR 271.1(i)). Where States impose such restrictions,the broader and more stringent State restrictions govern. <ITAG tagnum="85">V. Effect of the Land Disposal Restrictions Program on Other EnvironmentalPrograms</ITAG>A. Discharges Regulated Under the Clean Water Act As a result of the land disposal restrictions program, some generatorsmight switch from land disposal of restricted Second Third wastes to dischargeto publicly-owned treatment works (POTWs) in order to avoid incurring thecosts of alternative treatment. In shifting from land disposal to dischargeto POTWs, an increase in human and environmental risks could occur. Alsoas a result of the land disposal restrictions, hazardous waste genertorsmight illegally discharge their waste to surface waters without treatment,which could cause damage to the local ecosystem and potentially pose healthrisks from direct exposure or bioaccumlation. Some generators might treat their wastes prior to discharging to a POTW,but the treatment step itself could increase risks to the environment.For example, if incineration were the pretreatment step, metals and otherhazardous constituents present in air scrubber waters could be dischargedto surface waters. However, the amount of Second Third waste shifted toPOTWs would be limited by such factors as the physical form of the waste,the degree of pretreatment required prior to discharge, and State and localregulations. B. Discharges Regulated Under the Marine Protection, Research, and SanctuariesAct  Management of some of the hazardous wastes included in today's proposedrulemaking could be shifted from land disposal to ocean dumping and ocean-basedincineration. If the cost of ocean-based disposal plus transportation werelower than the cost of land-based treatment, disposal, and transportation,this option could become an attractive alternative. In addition, ocean-baseddisposal could become attractive to the regulated community if land-basedtreatment were not available.  However, the Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988 has restricted ocean dumpingof sewage sludge and industrial wastes to existing, authorized dumpersuntil December 31, 1991, after which ``* * * it shall be unlawful for anyperson to dump (sewage sludge or industrial wastes) into ocean waters ** *''. Therefore, the Ocean Dumping Ban Act has made moot any economicor other incentive to ocean dump industrial hazardous wastes, includingthe wastes subject to this regulation.  C. Air Emissions Regulated Under the Clean Air Act  Some treatment technologies applicable to Second Third wastes could resultin cross-media transfer of hazardous constituents to air. For example,incineration of metal-bearing wastes could result in metal emissions toair. Some constituents, such as chromium, can be more toxic if inhaledthan if ingested. Therefore, it might be necessary to issue regulatorycontrols for some technologies to ensure they are operated properly.  The Agency has taken several steps to address this issue. EPA has initiateda program to address metal emissions from incinerators. It has also initiatedtwo programs under section 3004(n) to address air emissions from othersources. The first program will address fugitive emissions from equipmentsuch as pumps, valves, and vents from units processing concentrated organicwaste streams. The second program will address other source of air emissions,such as tanks and waste transfer and handling.  D. Clean Up Actions Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,and Liability Act  The land disposal restrictions may have significant effects on the selectionand implementation of response actions that are taken under the ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Thereare three primary areas in which these effects may occur.  One area that may be affected by the LDR is in the selection of treatmentstandards at the remedial action site. The cleanup standards set at CERCLAsits are risk-based, while on the other hand, treatment standards developedunder the land disposal restrictions program are technology-based. Therefore,the technology-based treatment standards may be more stringent than therisk-based cleanup standards developed based on the CERCLA selection ofremedy criteria.  Another area that may be affected is in the treatment of soil and debriscontaminated with wastes restricted from land disposal. Contaminated soiland debris are a primary type of waste that must be remediated at mostCERCLA sites. In many cases, the soil matrix is different from that ofthe industrial waste for which treatment standards are set. CERCLA sitemanagers must either comply with the treatment standards or request andbe granted a variance from the treatment standard (andSection; 268.44) ora ``no-migration'' variance (andSection; 268.6).  Finally, even though the hazardous substances at a CERCLA remediation sitemay have been disposed prior to the effective date of RCRA, if the actioninvolves excavation and subsequent disposal, the wastes are subject tothe land disposal restrictions. If a waste is excavated from a unit, treated,and redisposed, ``placement'' of the waste in a land disposal unit hasoccurred and the treatment standard must be met. However, if the wasteis capped in place, ``placement'' has not occurred and the treatment standarddoes not have to be met.  E. Applicability of Treatment Standards to Wastes from Pesticides RegulatedUnder the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act  A number of generators of pesticide waste that have heretofore been comparativelyunaware of the land disposal restrictions may be regulated when today'sproposed rulemaking is promulgated. This will require that the agency developguidance materials and provide training on how to comply with the requirementsof the land disposal restrictions.  Generators of significant quantities of pesticide P and U wastes are farmersand commercial pesticide aplicators. The provisions of 40 CFR 262.70 exemptfarmers from regulation under the land disposal restrictions program; however,no such exemption exists for commercial applicators. Such generators ofhazardous wastes have traditionally land disposed their pesticide wastes.Subsequent to promulgation of today's proposed rule, these generators mustcomply with the requirements of the land disposal restrictions if theydispose a hazardous waste subject to treatment standards or ``soft hammer''provisions.  F. Regulatory Overlap of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Under the ToxicSubstance Control Act (TSCA) and RCRA.  Certain wastes listed as P and U contain PCBs. The PCB component of sucha waste mixture is regulated primarily under TSCA, whereas the listed Por U component of the waste is regulated under RCRA. Such a mixture oflisted/PCB waste must meet the applicable requirements under both statutes.Such a waste must go to an incinerator permitted under both TSCA and RCRA.Any ash residual from incineration must meet the treatment standard forthe listed waste component prior to land disposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Requirements</ITAG>A. Regulatory Impact Analysis<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Purpose</ITAG>The Agency estimated the costs, benefits, and economic impacts of today'sproposed rule to determine if it is a ``major'' regulation as defined byExecutive Order No. 12291. For all major rules, the Agency is requiredby the Executive Order to conduct a Regulatory Impact Analysis, and bythe Regulatory Flexibility Act to assess small business impacts. The costand economic impact estimates serve, additionally, as measures of the practicalcapability of facilities to comply with the proposed rule.The results indicate that today's proposed rule is not a major rule. Thissection of the preamble discusses the results of the analyses of the proposedrule.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Executive Order No. 12291</ITAG>Executive Order No. 12291 requires EPA to assess the effect of proposedAgency actions and alternatives during the development of regulations.Such an assessment consists of a quantification of the potential benefitsand costs of the rule, as well as a description of any beneficial or adverseeffects that cannot be quantified in monetary terms. In addition, ExecutiveOrder No. 12291 requires that regulatory agencies prepare a RegulatoryImpact Analysis (RIA) for major rules. Major rules are defined as thoselikely to result in:andbullet; An annual cost to the economy of $100 million or more; orandbullet; A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individualindustries; orandbullet; Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,innovation, or international trade.The Agency has conducted cost analysis and has concluded that the proposedrule is not a major rule. Annual costs to the economy are estimated atapproximately $24.9 million to $32.4 million for wastes not injected undergroundand an additional $3.9 million for those injected underground.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Basic Approach</ITAG>The Agency analyzed costs and benefits using the same approach and methodologythat was used for the August 17, 1988 First Third final rule (53 FR 31138).The effects of the proposed rule were estimated by comparing post-regulatorycosts, benefits, and economic impacts with those resulting under baselineconditions. The baseline for all Second and Third Third wastes is definedas continued land disposal of wastes in units meeting minimum technologicalrequirements. The baseline was not adjusted to reflect treatment requirementsthat would automatically occur in the absence of a rule after May 8, 1990.The baseline for First Third wastes included in this rule is defined astreatment needed to comply with the First Third Land Disposal Restrictionsrule or the soft hammer provisions that went into effect on August 8, 1988.This baseline corresponds to treatments evaluated under Alternative A Scenario2 in the First Thirds RIA (53 FR 31138, August 17, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Results</ITAG><T3>a. Population and Affected Facilities. </T3>The proposed rule willaffect 27 facilities. An additional 8 facilities would be affected by thesoft hammer provisions that will take effect on June 8, 1989.Only 20 injection facilities (with a total of 27 injection wells) willbe required to either treat wastes or file ``no migration'' petitions.These facilities will not significantly contribute to compliance costsalready incurred by injection well owners/operators managing Californialist and First Third wastes.<T3>b. Costs. </T3>The standards promulgated by this proposed rule areestimated to cost industry $28.8 million per year. If there is not enoughcapacity to treat the wastes subject to the soft hammer provisions, thefacilities may be able to continue managing their wastes in minimum technologyunits at no additional cost.If treatment capacity is available, wastes subject to the soft hammer provisionswould need to be treated. The Agency estimated the upper range costs oftreating those wastes by assuming these wastes would be incinerated. Thistreatment could add as much as $7.5 million to the cost of the rule. Lesscostly forms of treatment would be available for the soft hammered wastes,which would reduce the cost.In general, the Agency assumed that the least costly treatment would beselected. This assumption had negligible effects on the estimated costsexcept for the case of a mixed waste stream containing K027 and D007, aThird Third chromium waste. The Agency assumed that the mixed waste wouldbe treated to comply with the proposed rule. The Agency also assumed thatno treatment of the residual scrubber sludges to remove chromium wouldtake place because treatment standards for D007 have not been promulgated.Promulgation of standards for D007 under the Third Third rule would increasecosts for this mixed waste by approximately $28 million.The additional volume of injected wastes attributable to the Second Thirdschedule is small by comparison to the volumes of wastes regulated by previousCalifornia list and First Third rulemakings. The Agency performed an analysisto assess the economic effect of associated compliance costs for SecondThird wastes and found total compliance costs to be $3.9 million annuallyand petition costs are estimated at $0.1 million annually.<T3>c. Economic Impacts. </T3>The economic impact analysis estimates thatnone of the affected facilities would be significantly affected by theproposed rule. None of the affected facilities is expected to close asa result of the rule. <T3>d. Benefits. </T3>The benefits analysis estimated that the proposedrule would reduce the number of cancer cases by 0.07 and the number ofexposures to noncarcinogenic chemicals above threshold levels by 555. Benefits other than reduction in human health risk_such as resource damageavoided and corrective action costs avoided_were not quantified. As a result,the benefits of the land disposal restrictions for Second Third wastesare likely to be understated. B. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>whenever an agency is required to publish a notice ofrulemaking for a proposed rule, it must prepare and make available forpublic comment a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) that describes theeffect of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations,and small governmental jurisdictions). This analysis is unnecessary, however,if the Agency's Administrator certifies that the rule will not have a significanteconomic effect on a substantial number of small entities. According to EPA's guidelines for conducting an RFA, if over 20 percentof the population of small businesses, small organizations, or small governmentjurisdictions is likely to experience financial distress based on the costsof the rule, then the agency is required to consider that the rule willhave a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities andto perform a formal RFA. EPA evaluated the economic effect of the proposedrule, as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and determined thatno facilities would be significantly affected. The Administrator certifiesthat Part 268 and Part 148 will not have significant economic effects ona substantial number of small entities. As a result of this finding, theAgency has not prepared a formal RFA. C. Paperwork Reduction Act All information collection requirements in this proposed rule were promulgatedin previous land disposal restrictions rulemakings (other than those forthe Underground Injection Control Program) and approved by the Office ofManagement and Budget at that time. Since there are no new informationcollection requirements being proposed today, an Information CollectionRequest has not been prepared. For the Underground Injection Control Program, the information collectionrequirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval tothe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act, </T3>44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>Reporting and recordkeeping burden on the public for thiscollection is estimated at 745 hours for the respondents, with an averageof 14 hours per response. These burden estimates include all aspects ofthe collection effort and may include time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. If you wish to submit comments regarding any aspect of this collectionof information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, or if youwould like a copy of the information collection request (please referenceICR No. 370.09), contact Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S.Environmental Protection Agency, 401 Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460(202-382-2745); and Office of Management and Budget (Attn. Desk Officer,EPA), Paperwork Reduction Project (ICR No. 370.09), Washington, DC 20503.The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the informationcollection requirements contained in this proposal. D. Review of Supporting Documents The primary source of information on current land disposal practices andindustries affected by this rule was EPA's 1986 ``National Survey of HazardousWaste Treatment, Storage, Disposal, and Recycling Facilities (the TSDRSurvey). The average quantity of waste contributed by generator facilitieswas obtained from EPA's ``National Survey of Hazardous Waste Generatorsand Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities Regulated under RCRA in1981'' (April 1984).<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Implementation of the Land Disposal Restrictions Program</ITAG>The generator or owner/operator of a treatment, storage, and disposal facilitymust follow the waste management procedures specified in 40 CFR Part 268which are applicable to the restricted hazardous wastes subject to theprovisions in today's proposal. These wastes are listed in Subpart C ofPart 268. The corresponding treatment standards and effective dates arefound in Part 268 Subpart D. After the applicable effective date, a generatorof a waste must determine, at the point of initial generation, if the wastemeets the treatment standard. This determination can be made based on knowledgeor analysis of the hazardous constituents in the waste, in the treatmentresidual, or in an extract of the waste or treatment residual. Waste analysisdata and data supporting the generator's knowledge of the waste must bekept in the generator's files for five years.A waste which meets the treatment standard or is the subject of a nationalvariance, case-by-case extension, or ``no migration'' exemption can beland disposed. If the waste is subject to a national capacity varianceor a case-by-case extension and is disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment,the disposal unit must meet the minimum technological requirements of RCRA3005(o). The generator must satisfy the notification and certificationrequirements of 40 CFR 268.7(a) (2) and (3). The land disposal facilityis required by 40 CFR 268.7(c) to keep a record of the notice and certificationand verify that the treatment standard was met by testing according tothe frequency specified in the facility's waste analysis plan.A waste which does not naturally meet the treatment standard can be landdisposed after treatment to meet the treatment standard. The generatormust notify the treatment facility in accordance with 40 CFR 268.7(a)(1).The treatment facility must maintain a record of the notification and testthe treated wastes according to the frequency specified in the facility'swaste analysis plan. For treated wastes which meet the standard the treatmentfacility must provide the notice and certification required under 40 CFR268.7(b) (1) and (2) to the land disposal facility. For treated wasteswhich do not meet the standard the treatment facility must comply withthe notice requirements of 40 CFR 268.7(a)(1) if the waste will be managedat a different treatment facility.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Request for Data on Stabilization of Organic Constituents</ITAG>The Agency is soliciting data showing the performance of stabilizationtechnologies on organic waste constituents. These data should describethe treatment method and any relevant parameters, describe the feed andpost-treatment concentrations of constituents (the BDAT list of constituentsmay be useful), describe the analytical methods used, and include appropriateQA/QC data. This data is being gathered for possible future use by theAgency. This is intended to give the regulated community an opportunityto provide data that may be used by EPA for future decisions on the viabilityof stabilization as a treatment alternative for organic wastes. Pleaseidentify these comments with the heading ``Comments on Stabilization ofOrganics''.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX.
