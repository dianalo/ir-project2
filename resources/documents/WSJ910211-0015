Glitzy designer boutiques line &quot;Fifth Avenue,&quot; along witha gadget store called &quot;So-Ho,&quot; an array of fast-food jointsand a 70-ton fish tank next door called &quot;Fisherman's Wharf.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Welcome to MyCal Honmoku, an attempt by giant diversifiedretailer Nichii Co., to establish in Japan a large-scaleshopping center with an American touch. Never mind thatJapan's Fifth Avenue is a five-story building, which alsohouses a 300-seat version of Harlem's Apollo Theatre. Thecompany, which two years ago opened the 240-store complex,hopes the exotic -- and modified -- image will attractconsumers from all over Japan.   &quot;It may not be what America is really like,&quot; says aspokesman for Nichii. &quot;But it's an America that {Japanese}consumers dream of.&quot; MyCal, which stands for the company'sslogan of &quot;Mind Young Casual Amenity Life,&quot; is also meant tosound like &quot;My California,&quot; he says.   While a recession is hitting the 34,000 malls in the U.S.,Japan's rising consumerism is encouraging retailers to openlarge, upscale shopping centers nationwide. Nearly 90 centersare expected to open in Japan this year, many of them muchbigger than the existing 1,500 centers, which are oftenmerely supermarkets supplemented by a few boutiques. TheJapan Council of Shopping Centers predicts that the totalnumber of the nation's shopping centers could double in thenext decade.   But in a country where a majority of stores aremom-and-pop operations, shopping in malls is a big changefrom traditional Japanese shopping habits. Unlike in theU.S., where 70% of adult Americans make purchases, socializeor even just exercise in shopping centers every week, mostJapanese consumers frequent a number of neighborhood storesevery few days.   Still, retailers hope that if the Japanese life stylebecomes increasingly Westernized, as many industry analystsand sociologists expect it will, the concept of driving anextra half-hour to suburban malls will start to take hold.And to make the special visit worthwhile, retailers arespicing up the new malls with international themes,aquariums, Ferris wheels, churches and shrines, and even anindoor ski slope.   &quot;People won't go all the way there just to shop for dailynecessities,&quot; says Kenji Hashimoto, a researcher studyingshopping centers at the Distribution Economics Institute inTokyo. &quot;They have to have more upscale goods&quot; to drawconsumers, he says, as well as such attractions as glitterypachinko pinball parlors or even a restaurant with jugglingacts by an American clown.   Nichii aims to lure out-of-town visitors with artgalleries and fancy tea-rooms for dressed-up couples ondates. The center, which also includes 88 foreign boutiques,such as Ralph Lauren and Sharper Image, and such imitationforeign stores as &quot;Papaya Republic,&quot; posted sales of 32billion yen ($249.2 million) in the year ended March 31,1990.   Others, striving for expertise, are turning to foreigndevelopers for help.   Osaka Waterfront Development Co., a private developer,opened last summer its own version of the South StreetSeaport at Osaka port. It asked advice from EnterpriseDevelopment Co., which designed the seaport shopping mall inNew York. The 80-store Tempozan Market Place lines Osakaharbor with a jumble of pizza outlets, a Hawaiiansurfing-goods store, an American Indian handicraft store andother shops. And right next to the mall is a landmark,Japan's biggest aquarium.   Also planning to open shop in Japan are JMB Realty Corp.,a Chicago mall developer, and Canada's Triple Five Corp.,Edmonton, operator of the world's largest shopping center,West Edmonton mall.   The trend is providing a big opportunity for Westernretailers. Talbots Inc., a Boston-based women's clothingchain, and Laura Ashley and Body Shop are likely to befeatured in shopping centers planned by Jusco Co., a Japanesenational retail-chain member of Aeon Group. Aeon recentlypurchased Talbots and has a stake in the two British firms.Even Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, whose successful entry into the Japanesemarket was a test case for large-scale U.S. stores wanting toset up in Japan, will house many outlets in the new malls.   What has long prevented large malls from being built inJapan are the small, local merchants, who could force longdelays in the opening of stores larger than 500 square meters(5,400 square feet). That made it difficult for new, biggerstores to open. Discouraged by negotiations that often tookas long as 10 years to bring about the opening of a largestore, retailers often compromised on smaller store space toappease local shopkeepers.   But nudged along by U.S. trade officials -- who figurelarger stores will mean increased sales of foreign goods --Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry hasplaced a limit of 18 months for a proposed large store togain approval, and plans to shorten the wait to 12 monthswithin the next two years. Many companies are determined tomake use of the new opportunity, including Japanesenon-retailers with land to spare, such as Nissan Motor Co.and Bridgestone Corp.   For existing shopping centers, this means a sudden rise incompetition. &quot;Before, once we got a store built, we were safe{from competition} for the next 10 years,&quot; says MasaakiMangetsu, a spokesman for Jusco. &quot;But now, we don't know whena competitor will set up shop right near by.&quot; For safemeasure, the company attached a diving pool, bowling alleyand Ferris wheel to a 100-store shopping mall it opened twoyears ago.   LaLaport Funabashi, which has been touting its 360 stores-- situated to the east of Tokyo -- as Japan's biggestshopping center, last year added a mini-movie theater using150-inch video screens, and in two years plans to open theworld's biggest indoor ski resort next door.   Despite the attractions, the upscale stores are a littlemuch for some Japanese. &quot;The store owners are dressed inties, and you feel they're staring at you,&quot; says KazuoSuzuki, a 57-year-old Yokohama businessman browsing throughFifth Avenue one weekend with his wife. &quot;I wonder if it'slike this abroad,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
