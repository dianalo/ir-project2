BruceSundlun's decision to close 45 state chartered banks andcredit unions freezing $1.7 billion in deposits in some300,000 accounts.   The suit, filed in U.S. district court here, claimed thatthe state statute giving the governor the authority to closethe financial institutions is unconstitutionally vague anddoesn't provide any opportunity for public hearings. &quot;Thegovernor is confiscating property without due process,&quot; saidStephen J. Fortunato Jr., the Warwick, R.I., lawyer who filedthe suit.</LP><TEXT>   Gov. Sundlun closed the institutions on New Year's Dayafter a private deposit insurer failed. Although half theinstitutions have reopened with federal deposit insurance,the rest, holding some $1 billion in deposits, remain closedwhile the state works out a plan to repay depositors at acost to the state estimated at $150 million.   Mr. Fortunato said that as a &quot;fallback position,&quot; he wouldargue that Gov. Sundlun doesn't have the power to shut downbank activities related to trust accounts, cashiers checksand business other than demand deposits.   Mr. Sundlun's office didn't return phone calls seekingcomment on the case.   Mr. Fortunato filed a separate suit against the closedRhode Island Central Credit Union in state court, on behalfof people who have both mortgages and deposit accounts withthe credit union. Mr. Fortunato said the credit union hasordered customers to pay their mortgages to a new entitycalled RICUL Corporate Credit Union. He said that instead thecredit union should be required to take the mortgage paymentsfrom the frozen accounts.</TEXT></DOC>
