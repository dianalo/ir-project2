The first person to go on trial in the scandal that rocked thelast two years of the Reagan administration, North lost his$23,100-a-year Marine pension as soon as the jury delivered itsverdict Thursday.   Ex-President Reagan, who successfully resisted a defensesubpoena to testify at the trial, declined to comment after the manhe once called a national hero was found guilty.   North was acquitted of nine of the 12 criminal charges againsthim and prosecutor John Keker appeared less than satisfied with thedecision.   Still, Keker said, ``Colonel North has been convicted of threevery serious charges. The jury has spoken.'' North called it ``apartial vindication.''   North, to be sentenced June 23 by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.Gesell, faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and $750,000 infines. As a first-time offender with an exemplary 20-year militarycareer, North almost certainly will get penalties far less severethan that. Court appeals could take years.   The National Security Council's former ``action officer'' onCentral America counterattacked less than two hours after walkingout of the federal courthouse. He defiantly criticized the cost ofpursuing him through the legal system and suggested the prosecutionhad overstepped the bounds of fairness.   ``After more than two and a half years and over $40 million ofour taxpayers' money spent on investigations, congressionalinquisitions and now a special prosecutor who has likened me toAdolf Hitler, we now face many months and perhaps years of fightingthe remaining charges,'' North said, reading from a statement.   ``As a Marine, I was taught to fight and fight hard, for as longas it takes to prevail,'' he added. ``We will continue this battleand with the support and prayers of the American people, we will befully vindicated.''   In closing arguments last month, Keker said North and his formerboss, national security adviser Robert McFarlane, ``are followingAdolf Hitler's old strategy: The victor will never be asked if hetold the truth.''   North got an endorsement of sorts from one of the jurors,65-year-old Earl Williams, who served in Patton's 3rd Army in WorldWar II.   ``He made some mistakes, you know, but I don't think he shouldgo to jail for it ... a hero like he was,'' Williams told CBS Newsfollowing deliberations that totaled 64 hours over 12 days.   Williams had an apparent change of heart overnight, however. Inan interview today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' he said ofNorth: ``Well, personally, I feel that if he's guilty he should goto jail. Which he is, so, you know ....''   North won't get his military pension back unless his convictionfor altering and shredding sensitive NSC documents is overturned onappeal.   ``Once the conviction goes into effect, whatever time that is,he loses his retired pay,'' said Pentagon spokeswoman LindaDumoulin. The conviction is legally effective as soon as thesecretary of the Navy is formally notified and the paperworkcompleted.   For North, intensely proud of his Marine career, the pain ofthat punishment is likely to be more in its symbolism than itsfinancial cost. Conservative groups have been willing to pay him asmuch as $20,000 in speaking fees for a single appearance, and justa few hours after his conviction, two more speaking engagementswere announced in Cleveland for May 11.   In seeking to overturn the convictions, North's lawyers willfirst file post-trial motions with Gesell on the question ofwhether North's case was tainted by his and other witnesses'nationally televised immunized congressional testimony in 1987.That could mean delving further into the knowledge of jurors, thegrand jurors who indicted North and prosecutors in the office ofindependent counsel Lawrence Walsh. Gesell set a deadline of 10days for the defense to announce its intentions.   North was found innocent of charges that focused on lying andobstructing Congress in 1985 and 1986 by denying he was assistingthe Contras. At the time his superiors had passed along an orderfrom Reagan to see to the needs of the rebels, and to do sosecretly during a congressional ban on military aid, according totrial testimony.   But North was found guilty of aiding and abetting an obstructionof Congress as well as shredding and altering documents in November1986, crimes that occurred after the Iran arms sales had beenpublicly disclosed. North also was found guilty of accepting a$13,800 home security system in mid-1986 from Iran-Contraco-defendant Richard Secord, whom North had enlisted to run arms tothe Contras.   President Bush used the occasion of the verdict to speak out ona major question raised by evidence in the trial _ whether as vicepresident he helped circumvent the ban on U.S. aid to the Contras.   Bush, who previously had declined to comment because of theongoing trial proceedings, declared Thursday that he never toldHonduras' president that U.S. aid would be linked to that country'ssupport for the Nicaraguan rebels.   Bush declared firmly that there was no deal, ``no quid pro quo.''   Some conservatives, meanwhile, clamored for a presidentialpardon of North. Richard A. Viguerie, chairman of the UnitedConservative Union, declared that ``Oliver North deserves a medal,not a prison sentence.''   But on Capitol Hill, conservative Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.,opposed a pardon, saying, ``The man was indicted and the jurydecided that the facts upheld three of the indictments. It'sobviously a tragedy for him and his family. But no one is above thelaw.''</TEXT></DOC>
