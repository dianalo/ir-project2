That's the conclusion of Johnson Matthey, a preciousmetals refining company that yesterday released its annualreport on platinum, palladium and rhodium.</LP><TEXT>   Demand for platinum rose 5.5% last year to record levels,but supplies rose 9%, also to a record, resulting in thefirst surplus in platinum since 1984, according to JohnsonMatthey. Another surplus is expected this year.   Weak auto sales in the U.S. caused the industry's demandfor platinum, which is used in catalytic converters, to fallto 690,000 ounces last year from 725,000 ounces in 1989. Thisyear, demand from the U.S. auto sector will flatten ordecline, Johnson Matthey predicted.   The clean-air movement in Europe, however, is just gettingstarted and Johnson Matthey predicts that European demand forplatinum will nearly double to 700,000 ounces by 1993.   Other industrial demand, such as from the petroleum,glass, and electronics industries, is expected to fall inpart because of the lower level of industrial activity in theU.S. and Europe, according to Johnson Matthey. But jewelrydemand, particularly in Japan, remains strong, the firm said.   Supply is a bigger question than demand, Johnson Mattheyofficials said. To raise much-needed foreign currency, theSoviet Union last year sold 700,000 ounces of platinum, themost in 15 years and 27% above 1989, Johnson Matthey said.Some of the platinum appears to be older metal coming fromstockpiles, the officials said, and with strikes at majorplatinum mines disrupting production, it is doubtful that theSoviets will be able to keep up that export pace withoutdepleting their inventories.   Johnson Matthey predicts platinum prices will rise toward$450 an ounce during the year as the economy and investorsentiment improve.   But Jeffrey Christian of CPM Group, a New York preciousmetals research and consulting firm, predicts prices willtrade this year between $350 and $400 an ounce, and couldfall much lower in the years ahead.   Platinum supplies have exceeded industrial demand byseveral hundred thousand ounces per year for several years,Mr. Christian said. That imbalance will continue until pricesfall to levels low enough to discourage supply from coming tothe market.   But even if prices fall, platinum production mightcontinue at a high level to keep auto makers supplied withrhodium, a byproduct of platinum production critical tocatalytic converters, he noted.   Platinum for July delivery ended 40 cents an ounce lowerat $393.20.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: The price of crude oil for June delivery skidded36 cents a barrel to $20.91 during a spate of selling late inthe trading session. There had been little action throughmost of the day and what action there was seemed to be morerelated to market technicals than news reports. A report thatCitgo Petroleum Corp. had idled some of its gasoline refiningcapacity for repairs barely caused a flutter in gasolineprices. And although reports early in the day that gunfirehad been exchanged between British marines and Iraqi soldiersin northern Iraq caused an initial flurry of buying, thatactivity dropped off quickly. Indeed, oil industry traders inthe cash, or spot, market remained on the sidelines as theycontinued to assess their coming needs.                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of hog futures contractsclimbed amid signs that farmers will reduce their sales tomeatpackers. Dry weather is expected to allow Midwest farmersto resume planting their rain-delayed crops. Traders arespeculating that farmers will be too busy in the fields tomarket as many hogs as they have in recent weeks, said MarkStevens, a livestock analyst at Cargill Investor ServicesInc., Chicago. The market shrugged off news that ConAgra Inc.indefinitely closed a hog-slaughtering plant in St. Joseph,Mo., effective yesterday. The plant had a payroll of about900 employees and has a capacity to slaughter 45,000 hogsweekly. Meatpackers have seen their profits dwindle becausethey are paying a relatively high price to farmers for hogsat a time when retail demand is softening.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices fell sharply on weak demand andbearish technical indicators. Copper for July delivery fellthree cents a pound to end at 99.25 cents. London MetalExchange stocks rose by 10% to 288,557 short tons, theexchange said Friday. Combined with the Comex stocks of24,972 tons, inventories are at their highest levels sinceearly 1986, said John E. Gross, a West Nyack, N.Y., metalsconsultant. Copper prices followed the decline in otherindustrial metals, such as aluminum and nickel, reflectingthe poor economic climate, a trader said. Also, copper priceshad been supported recently by investors who had expected thetightness in the May deliveries in London to have a greatereffect on July and later months, said Mike Frawley, a metalstrader at Dean Witter; but the squeeze remained isolated inMay. Traders also read the recent surge in outstandingcontracts on the Comex -- to 42,880 contracts as of Friday --as a bearish indicator. &quot;When open interest increases, itindicates the trend will continue,&quot; a trader said. Mr. Gross,however, expects a technical correction ahead. Moreover,there are still labor contracts -- and the possibility ofsupply disruptions -- coming up fairly soon in Canada andChile, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
