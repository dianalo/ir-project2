canpotentially mean very different things.andM;But in all cases, it includes computer-based handling of mundane tasksassociated with operations.andP;  In some implementations, it extends intoproblem-solving with minimal human intervention.andP;  In the most extremeexamples, it translates into the complete automation of all data centeroperations with no immediate human supervision.andM;According to John Connor, product manager for systems automation products atBoole andamp; Babbage, Sunnyvale, Calif., &quot;Fully unattended data centers won'thappen.&quot;andM;Connor grants a possible exception for remote sites where no tape mounts orprinters exist.andP;  For these environments, &quot;true unattended operations may befeasible.&quot;andM;Effectively managing change in large data centers is a tak of increasingcomplexity.andP;  A recent Gartner Group report estimates that, by 1992, computingfacilities in Fortune 1000 companies will have to maintain an average of 430Mips (million instructions per second); 15,000 terminals; 250,000 files; morethan 20,000 different messages; and a variety of inconsistent subsystems.andO;Gartner is a consulting firm based in Stamford, Conn.andM;With expanding computer networks, high personnel turnover and the increasingsophistication of data center and system support software, a complicatedsituation emerges.andM;According to Arnold Farber, a principal of Farber/La Chance Inc., aconsulting firm in Richmond, Va., &quot;Unattended operations is the next step toa sophisticated, automated data center.andP;  In the future, processes will runthrough an entire cycle, start-to-finish, with no human inter-vention--no'fingerprints.'andP;  Humans simply can't keep up with 90 million instructions persecond.&quot;andM;NOT UNIVERSALLY FEASIBLEandM;However, a lights-out environment is not feasible for mostproduction-oriented industries where day-to-day decision-making is still afundamental task enacted only by humans.andP;  In these data centers, dailyoperational occurrences, such as problem alerts, continue to necessitatehuman resolution.andM;Data center managers with experience in the autmation process contend thatthe ultimate goal of automation is to provide the highest level of service tocustomers and users.andP;  By increasing the availability, reliability andaccuracy of operations services, data centers should be able to containescalating costs.andM;According to these managers, head-count reduction should not be the drivingforce behind automation efforts.andP;  Instead, increased operational and costefficiencies should be gained through streamlining procedures and bymaximizing the use of existing resources.andM;During the past decasde, operations staffs in large data processing shopshave increased in step with the increase in processing power.andP;  Traditionally,every time a major issue arose within the data center, an individual washired to resolve it.andP;  Unfortunately, a parallel increase in service level wasnot guaranteed.andM;Automation can eliminate labor-intensive tasks via error minimization,improved productivity and problem prediction and prevention.andP;  Daily manualupdating is virtually absent in automated shops, thus relieving operators ofboring, routine tasks and freeing them to perform more problem resolution.andM;Years ago, the concept of computerization conjured up visins of robotsreplacing humans at the work site.andP;  Uncertainty and fear of computersprevailed even though, in many cases, the introduction of computers actuallycreated new jobs.andM;Today, the reaction of data center personnel to unattended operation isanalogous to unattended operation is analogous to that earlier fear.andM;Said Frank Pikela, vice president of marketing for Unison Software, Mountainfor Unison Software, Mountain View, Calif., &quot;While automation may cause someshort-term staff displacement, in the long run it creates job enhancement.&quot;andM;By developing broadened technical skills, former operators become morevaluable to their organizations because they can take an active, rather thanreactive, role in the data center.andM;Data center automation did result in workforce reduction at Acro Gas andamp; Oil,Plano, Tex.andP;  From the launching of the automation project in September 1988until December 1989, when most of the major pieces were in place, headcountwas reduced by 15.andP;  The current operations staff works 12-hours shifts threedays a week.andP;  Arco runs two shifts per day, with two operators on duty duringthe day-time and one operator on duty nights and weekends.andM;Arco Gas andamp; Oil uses the Auto-Operator package from Boole andamp; Babbage,Sunnyvale, Calif.andP;  Arco's data center runs an IBM 3090-500J, an IBM 3090-600Eand an Amdahl 5890-300.andP;  The center averages 143 large-scale batch jobsmonthly and serves an average of 500 simultaneous TSO users daily.andM;&quot;Automation has brought consistency to our operations,&quot; said Chuck Murphy,manager of computing operations and support at Arco.andM;Dave Kunkle, automated operations project leader at Arco Gas andamp; Oil, concurs.andO;&quot;Consistency is the primary focus.andP;  It's the easiest thing to demonstratebecause the machine now tracks things that people tracked previously.&quot;andM;Michael J. Connolly, senior manager at Nolan, Norton andamp; Co., a KPMF PeatMarwick information technology firm located in Lexington, Mass., said, &quot;Withdata centers becoming increasingly complex, companies are under extreme costpressures.andP;  They must pick up on efficiencies and plan for contingencies.andO;And, they must minimize the risk of error.&quot;andM;By automating its data center operations, Blue Cross-Blue Shield (BCBS) ofBoston, a health-insurance provider serving 3 million subscribers, improvedcustomer-service levels by increasing on-time deliverables from 70% to 98%.andM;Data entry is obsolete at the BCBS data center, which now has three mainfunctions, each performed by a separate group:andM;* Systems Control is a &quot;watchdog&quot; group that does JCL, reconciliationprocedures and balancing.andM;* Production Control is the group responsible for marketing the servicesavailable to users.andM;*omputer Operations is the group that mounts tapes and manages printers.andM;To achieve BCBS's goal improving productivity, three automatic operators wereinstalled at the Boston data center--the CA-1 automatic tape managementsystem from Computer Associates International, Inc., Garden City, N.Y.; areport-distribution/batch-output system called Infopac, from MobiusManagement Systems, Inc., New Rochelle, N.Y.; and the CA-7 automaticproduction-control and job-scheduling system from Computer Associates.andO;BCBS's data center runs an IBM 3090 and a Honeywell Bull DPS-90.andM;BCBS's automation project, &quot;Productivity through Automation,&quot; wasincorporated in several phases at the 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week shop.andO;Ken Longo, director of the data center, advised, &quot;Don't try to 'sell&quot; yourtotal automation project all at once, or management may not endorse it.&quot;andM;Instead, Longo suggests breaking down the master plan into a series ofpractical projects and documenting each to demonstrate success and gaincredibility.andM;A recent phase of BCBS's automation project included the conversion fromimpact printing to electronic printing.andP;  By being able to design and createforms using a Siemens 2300 Electronic Printer, BCBS is poised to delivervalue-added service to its agents.andP;  In the future, continuous-roll printingwill complement existing services.andM;In some industries, lights-out operation can achieve vital competitiveadvantage.andP;  In banking, where funds-transfer deadlines are subject to finesand interest, the reliability and availability to be gained by unattendedoperation could prove critical.andM;STARTED BY CONSOLIDATINGandM;Early in 1988, when networks and services grew cumbersome for WholesaleComputing Services (WCS), a division of New York-based Manufacturers HanoverTrust, it initiated data center consolidation to realize greaterefficiencies.andM;Its first step was to build a more efficient infrastructure by consolidatingseven data centers down to two large utility sites.andP;  The smaller of thesedata centers became the target site for all remote activities.andP;  Data centerconsolidation generated savings of $12 million per year.andM;All labor-intensive operations--including production control, change controland printing services--were consolidated to take advantage of the economiesof scale offered by the data center utility concept as envisioned by WCS.andM;One WCS data center runs two IBM 3094s supporting 28 CICS regions and 220 TSOusers; the remote facility runs an IBM 3084 and 3090 supporting to CICSregions.andM;After this extensive consolidation, WCS saw real opportunities to gainsavings through unattended operation.andP;  For example, the division institutedthe Automate/XC console-monitor device from Legent Corporation, Vienna, Va.,andO;to monitor and control remote systems via PCs and IBM 3X79 console devices.andM;Automate/MVS from Legent was also implemented to: reduce message traffic onsystem consoles; respond automatically to system-and application-generatedmessages; automate manual and redundant procedures that otherwise would haveto be performed by operations staff; and reroute system-console activity to apersonal computer.andM;&quot;Cross-functional coordination among the technical-support group, theoperations staff and a half-dozen major development groups proved to be asignificant challenge,&quot; stated Mike Pasiecki, WCS senior vice president.andO;&quot;And ongoing staff committment was essential to the success of the projects.&quot;andM;Its frank acknowledgment that automation would ultimately cause somedisplacement of staff won WCS management credibility within the operationsstaff.andM;Howard Taylor, assistant vice president, agrees with Pasiecki that the humanelement was critical in achieving unattended operations.andM;However, he identified an additional group: &quot;The key to the project's successwas senior management support all the way.&quot;andM;Management support was also identified as critical by Michael Homonylo of STMSystems Corp., Willowdale, Ontario, a $260 million computer-servicesprovider.andP;  &quot;It's critical to get management buy-in--and at the right level,&quot;he said.andP;  STM has implemented several automatic-operator tools, includingComputer Associates' CA-7 and AF/Operator from Candle Corporation, LosAngeles.andM;STM Systems' automation accomplishments are ranked in the top 10% ofcomputing centers in North America, according to the Gartner Group.andM;PILOT PROJECTSandM;For the Quebec Automobile Insurance Board (RAAQ), pilot projects helped toensure their automation success.andP;  The board serves six million customersacross Ontario, Canada, by supplying them with driver's licenses, automobileplates and automobile insurance policies.andM;&quot;Increased availability and coping with complexity,&quot; were cited by CharlesGratton, chief of operations at RAAQ, as the prime reasons for automating.andO;RAAQ offers easy-access information on stolen vehicles and driver's licensesto police institutions from 210 customer service centers, 24 hours a day,seven days a week.andM;&quot;We wanted zero-seconds delay,&quot; Gratton said.andP;  &quot;Our operations must be up andrunning all the time to respond to police investigations.&quot;andM;On weekend and night shifts, no operators are present.andP;  One individual is oncall from a remote site using a paging system.andP;  During most day shifts, withas many as 1,000 users depending on their service, RAAQ is reluctant toeliminate all staff.andP;  Like many data center managers who operate a lights-outenvironment, Gratton maintains a need exists for a limited staff to monitorand protect the physical integrity of the data center.andP;  Said Gratton, &quot;Westill want people there, up to a certain point.&quot;andM;The RAAQ technical support group responds to all complex problems byemploying experts systems technology, coined &quot;automated technical support.&quot;andO;An expert systems engine is the &quot;core&quot; to all their automation products.andM;Most monitoring tasks have been relinquished to tools such as AF/Operator andAF/Remote from Candle Corporation.andP;  RAAQ also uses Computer Associates's CA-7for batch scheduling and runs an IBM 3090 and three Apache AS/EX Model 80s.andM;Tom Roan, vice president of national accounts for Atlantic Data Services(ADS) in Quincy, Mass., a consulting firm that provides computer services tothe financial services industry, agrees that the human element is animportant consideration in the successful implementation of automatedoperations.andM;Three major issues arise when organizations implement unattended operations.andO;First, there are questions regarding technical issues, because the systemsstaff will have to implement the automation tools and integrate them into theexisting information systems.andM;The second area of concern might be termed &quot;turf issues.&quot;andP;  Operationspersonnel have significant career investments in their jobs and are naturallyleery of implementing systems that appear to obviate their roles.andP;  Turfissues often go unexpressed, and this poses a challenge to informationsystems management.andM;The third areac of concern is cultural and most frequently pertains to theissue of centralization.andP;  Departments are concerned about losing control oftheir computing services and worry that no one will take responsibility forseeing that their processing needs are met once no staff is standing by tooversee operations.andM;AUTOMATION IN ACADEMIAandM;The issued have all been addressed at Boston University.andP;  &quot;We had five timesas many people as we needed,&quot; said Howard Miller, assistant vice president,university information systems, at Boston University (BU).andM;Miller has more than 20 years experience in systems management and isexecutive director of the Information Technology Institute, a research andpublishing organization for computer center automation and softwaredevelopment based in Byfield, Mass.andP;  He was a keynote speaker at theAssociation for Computer Operations Management (Afcom) conference held thispast March in Washington.andM;Like most organizations intent on automating data center operations, BUwanted to improve overall quality and service levels to its users.andP;  Also, &quot;Wemaintained a goal for a totally unattended operation--all shifts, every dayof the week,&quot; Miller said.andM;In three years, BU has reduced its data center staff by 80%--from 14 to threepeople--through attrition and promotion.andP;  It now employs one applicationprogrammer and two operation analysts.andM;BU is a single-CPU shop, running MVS/XA on an IBM 3090.andP;  The BU data centerhas no operations staff and no production-control staff.andP;  Users now performtheir own scheduling, thereby eliminating all intermediate requests.andM;Another prime strategy implemented by BU is value-added data handling.andP;  Theuniversity users now use online viewing to print only the information theyneed, thus reducing print volume.andM;Larry Ouellette, BU operations analyst, explained, &quot;Users now have a greaterintimacy with the job stream and the impact on their business cycles.andP;  Theyknow what a given job does and how to reconcile it with the appropriatefiles.&quot;andP;  BU users can add and delete jobs, thus streamlining informationrequests.andM;The AF/Operator console-automation software generates standard responses tostandard prompts.andP;  Consistent delivery of correct responses and speedyresponse to error situations make the software almost transparent to theuser.andM;At BU, the console tool is the most significant automated operator.andP;  Itprovides links to other core automation software--job scheduling, electronicreport distribution and DASD management.andM;To resolve &quot;abends&quot; (abnormal program terminations), BU developed anautomated problem and response system (APRS).andP;  Written in AF/Operator code,APRS will invoke AF/Operator to capture the message when a job fails.andP;  If thejob is not critical to other programs, APRS will notify the system of theerror and rerun it.andM;Miller cites &quot;bolstering enthusiasm among the user community&quot; as the reasonfor the project's success.andP;  &quot;Given the opportunity to set their own goals,&quot;stated Miller, &quot;users continually drove themselves to live up to their ownhigh expectations.&quot;andM;In the three years since BU initiated data center automation, its computingcapacity has doubled, DASD has increased 60% and the number of computingprograms has increased 235%.andP;  Nevertheless, BU has simultaneously been ableto improve its level of service by 50%andM;Through automation, the university realized a total savings of $2.5 millionper year.andP;  The data center's operating budget is actually less now than itwas three years ago.andM;Data center savings helped fund other improvements in the computingresources.andP;  About one mile from the main campus data center, a trasferfacility stores backups in an unattended electronic vault.andP;  The vault isconnected to a recovery site.andP;  &quot;The electronic vault,&quot; said Miller, &quot;is themost unique feature of our automation.&quot;andM;ADVICE TO IMPLEMENTERSandM;Those organizations planning to implement unattended operations may beinterested in the advice of Mark Levin, principal, Advanced Technology, KPMGPeat Marwick.andP;  &quot;Get a handle on where you are today and where you want tobe,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Start where you have the greatest pain or the highesteconomic impact.&quot;andM;According to Levin, information should flow through the data center withouthuman intervention.andP;  &quot;Look at all manual activities required in processing.andO;You'll see that some activities are unecessary.andP;  Eliminate all redundantactivities, and automate all the necessary activities.&quot;andM;To compete in the global market, businesses must continually seek higherproductivity to achieve optimum service levels.andP;  As technology evolves tomeet this demand, the role of automation in the data center can only expand.andM;Hodges is a Boston-based market research consultant specializing ininformation systems and environmental sciences.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
