Gold prices dropped, reflecting the good U.S. inflation readingand the dollar's advance. Investors often choose gold as a hedgeagainst rising inflation.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for currentdelivery tumbled $4.30 to $368.30 a troy ounce. Republic NationalBank of New York quoted a bid of $368.20 for an ounce of bullion at4 p.m. EDT, down $3.70 from Tuesday's late bid.   Immediately after the Labor Department reported in the earlymorning that the Consumer Price Index edged up 0.2 percent in June,currency dealers sold dollars. Last month's CPI rate wassignificantly smaller than May's 0.6 percent increase and the lowestmonthly rate since February 1988.   The initial dollar selling was based on the thinking thatmoderating inflation could increase the chances for the FederalReserve Board to loosen its credit policies further and drive downU.S. interest rates.   But the dollar sales soon abated.   John McCarthy, chief currency dealer at the Amsterdam RotterdamBank's New York office, said renewed demand for dollars emerged whenit became apparent that the sellers lacked enough conviction to pushthe dollar below thresholds considered technically important.   Plus, the dollar benefited from rallies in the stock and bondmarkets Wednesday, which indicated that demand fordollar-denominated investments remains robust despite thepossibility of lower U.S. interest rates.   ``I think the fact that U.S. rates are declining is not a barrierto interest in the dollar,'' said McCarthy.``People are buying U.S.securities for capital appreciation. The attractiveness of the U.S.bond and stock markets makes the dollar attractive.''   The financial markets will be waiting Thursday for clues aboutFed policy when Alan Greenspan, the central bank chairman, testifiesat a congressional hearing.
