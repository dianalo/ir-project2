No pickup. ^By RANDALLHACKLEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Writers today denounced Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's call forthe death of Salman Rushdie, and West Germany asked the U.N.Security Council to address the issue. President Bush said hesupports moves to isolate the Islamic republic.   Khomeini said the Western reaction proved it was wrong for Iranto open contacts to the rest of the world.   A conference of Moslem theologians in Saudi Arabia said Rushdie,who was born into a Moslem family, should stand trial in an Islamiccountry for his novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' a Saudi newspaperreported today.   Rushdie's wife, American novelist Marianne Wiggins, canceled aU.S. book-promotion tour to stay with her husband, who is in hidingin Britain. She had planned the tour to promote ``John Dollar,'' herlatest novel.   Anti-terrorist police today guarded a plant in Cles, Italy, where``The Satanic Verses'' was being printed, and Italians placedhundreds of orders for it as a publisher prepared to release asecond run of the controversial book.   West Germany, Iran's biggest trading partner, said today it hadcanceled two visits by Cabinet ministers to Iran, and it called onthe Security Council to take up the issue.   A West German television network said the Cabinet also discussed``further measures'' against Iran. ``If the mullahs adhere to theexecution order against (Rushdie), then economic sanctions will nolonger be ruled out,'' the ZDF network reported.   West Germany already has decided to remove its ambassador fromTehran as part of an action by the 12 European Economic Communitycountries.   Bush said on Tuesday he supported the EEC decision and told anews conference in Washington that no matter how offensive Rushdie'sbook may be to Moslems, ``inciting murder and offering rewards forits perpetration are deeply offensive to the norms of civilizedbehavior.''   Khomeini, who issued a death sentence on Rushdie on Feb. 14, saideconomic sanctions will not change his stance, and he saidpublication of ``The Satanic Verses'' was a sign from God that Iranshould not reach out to Western nations.   ``God wanted it to happen in this way so that we may no longerthink in simplistic ways,'' he said.   Hundreds of literary figures marched outside the Iranian Missionto the United Nations in New York this morning and then to two FifthAvenue book stores _ B. Dalton's and Barnes andamp; Noble _ which havepulled ``The Satanic Verses'' from their shelves.   ``I write controversial books. What publisher is now going totake chances with a controversial book?'' asked activist AbbieHoffman, one of those participating.   A trio of Yale University graduates set up a toll-free numberthrough which anyone may order the book. The number, 1-800-544-7475,was scheduled to go into effect at 3 p.m., said Kevin Kiernan ofManhattan.   The novel, which some say insults Islam, will debut as No. 2 onThe New York Times Book Review's best-selling hardcover fiction listin the March 5 issue, the Times said today.   The paper published a full-page advertisement from theAssociation of American Publishers, the American BooksellersAssocation and the American Library Association that says: ``Freepeople write books, free people publish books, free people buybooks, free people read books.''   In the Netherlands, more than 800 Dutch writers, artists,publishers and journalists today took out a half-page ad in nationalnewspapers requesting their government to break diplomatic ties withIran if the execution order is not rescinded.   Publishers in France, West Germany, Greece and Turkey canceledplans to publish the book, which has been banned by at least sevencountries, including India, Pakistan and Egypt.   Canada's revenue minister, Otto Jelinek, who made the decisionnot to ban ``The Satanic Verses'' in Canada, said he was underpolice guard after receiving death threats.   In London, the 2,000-member International Press Institutedeplored the death threats against Rushdie as ``a gross violation ofcivilized standards on the right of life and the right to freedom ofexpression.''   The Moslem World League, meeting in Saudi Arabia, said Rushdieshould be tried in absentia in an Islamic state ``for his ...misleading allegations against Islam,'' the London-based newspaperAl-Sharq Al-Awsat reported.   Many Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' is sacrilegious becauseit casts doubt on central tenets of the Islamic faith. The book, forexample, portrays the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes andsuggests he wrote the Koran, the holy book of Islam, rather thanreceiving it from God.   Nicholas Browne, Britain's charges d'affaires in Iran, returnedhome with two other top diplomats today and said: ``The statementsby Ayatollah Khomeini have given us no choice but to leave Tehran.''   A total of $5.2 million has been offered by Iranian clerics forRushdie's murder. The writer issued an apology Saturday, butKhomeini rejected it.</TEXT></DOC>
