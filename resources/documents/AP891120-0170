In one instance, the panel persuaded the EPA tohold off for years after the agency itself concluded that thepesticide Alar, used on apples, should be banned because it is a``probable'' cause of cancer in humans and a ``known'' cause ofcancer in laboratory animals. Alar's manufacturer, UniroyalChemical Co., voluntarily took the compound off the domestic marketearlier this year. EPA now says it will formally announce a ban inJanuary.   _Every one of the 10 non-governmental members of a particularAgriculture Department committee created in 1987 to developregulatory policy on the contamination of food by microbiologicalagents such as salmonella and botulism was an employee, contractoror consultant of the food industry. Such contaminants cause morethan 7,000 deaths and 6 million illnesses each year. TheAgriculture Department argued in court that the one-sidedcomposition of the panel did not violate a federal law calling forbalanced representation, but in recent months has added severalmembers from outside the industry.   _A motor vehicle safety panel established in 1987 by theNational Highway Traffic Safety administration to help ``formulatethe motor vehicle safety research agenda for the next decade'' wasstacked with employees and others with financial ties to the autoindustry, and not one representative of consumer groups wasappointed.   In enacting the Federal Advisory Committee Act in 1972, Congressrecognized that such panels can be ``a useful and beneficial meansof furnishing expert advice, ideas, and diverse opinions to thefederal government.'' But then-Sen. Charles Percy, R-Ill., asponsor of that law, also summarized the dangers:   ``Viewed in its worst light, the federal advisory committee canbe a convenient nesting place for special interests seeking tochange or preserve a policy for their own ends. Such committees,stacked with giants in their respective fields, can overwhelm afederal decision-maker, or at least make him wary of upsetting thestatus quo.''   The 1972 law requires that all federal advisory committees mustbe ``fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented andthe functions to be performed.'' However, never in the succeeding17 years has a federal court altered the composition of an advisorycommittee, despite many legal challenges. Though several judgeshave harshly criticized panels dominated by special interests, theyhave found the language of the law too vague to enforce.   In the case involving the Agriculture Department's NationalAdvisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for foods,government attorneys went so far as to argue that the panel met thebalanced representation requirement because the food industryemployees are also ``consumers of food.''   An incredulous U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn interjected:   ``But I'm sure you'll agree that the industry representativeshave a certain point of view ....''   Government attorney Jeffrey Gutman: ``They perhaps have acertain point of view, given their employment status.''   Penn: ``They can't help but have, isn't that correct?''   Gutman: ``I will permit the court to take judicial notice of anypredisposition that these individuals may have.''   In spite of that concession by the government, Penn dismissedPublic Citizen's lawsuit, and joined other jurists in expressingfrustration with the law, which he said ``presents variousobstacles to appropriate judicial interpretation.''   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, has introduced legislation designed tosharpen the statute's language. ``I am disturbed to find continuedlitigation over basic questions'' regarding the balancedrepresentation requirement, he says.   Ms. Goldman says Glenn's bill contains ``some very useful,sensible changes,'' but she faults it for retaining a provisionthat allows some federal agencies to appoint panels whose membersdon't have to file even a simplified financial disclosure statement.   A final version of Glenn's bill has yet to be drafted. That, ofcourse, will be done in a congressional committee.</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
