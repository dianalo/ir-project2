Lt. Col. Luis del Cid, a Noriega loyalist who commanded a PanamaDefense Forces unit in the province of Chiriqui, gave himself up toU.S. forces in Panama, said spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade.   Del Cid was one of 15 Noriega associates indicted in February1988 by a federal grand jury in Miami. He is wanted on four countsrelated to cocaine possession and laundering drug profits, thespokeswoman said.   After turning himself in, del Cid was arrested by agents of theDrug Enforcement Administration in Panama, she said.   DEA agents escorted him to Miami. ``Normally he would have beenflown in by U.S. marshals, but this was not an ordinary case,'' shesaid.   Ms. Burstion-Wade said Monday night that del Cid had been takento the Metro Correctional Institute, a federal facility in Miami.His initial court appearance was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon,and U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtenin is to handle the matter for thegovernment, she said.   Del Cid surrendered on Saturday and declared loyalty to the newgovernment of Guillermo Endara, installed as president last weekafter U.S. troops invaded Panama to remove Noriega from power.   The Miami indictment unsealed Feb. 5, 1988 against Noriega, delCid and others alleges that the ousted strongman accepted a $4.6million bribe from Colombia's Medellin cartel to protect shipmentsof cocaine, launder money, supply drug laboratories and shield drugtraffickers from the law.   A separate federal grand jury in Tampa, Fla., indicted Noriegaseveral days later on charges of taking another $5.4 million bribefrom the Colombia drug cartel.   The Justice Department has said that if Noriega is brought tothe United States, he would be tried first in Miami because theprosecutors' case there was stronger than in Tampa.</TEXT></DOC>
