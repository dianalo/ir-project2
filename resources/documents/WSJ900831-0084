In today's global economy, it shouldremind us that America's prosperity depends on the quality ofits individuals -- its human capital.   When money and industry can cross national borders withease, the main competition is for brains and grit. With alabor shortage widely predicted in coming decades, the U.S.needs to find ways to attract and retain the world's bestworkers. A study to be released next week by some ofAmerica's business leaders offers some useful ideas on how todo it.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;America has entered an era of fewer entrants into thework force and an aging population,&quot; declares the Committeefor Economic Development's report, &quot;An America That Works.&quot;&quot;As recently as the early 1980s, there were too few jobs in aslack economy, but we can now expect plentiful jobs in manycommunities as labor markets tighten. Our new problem is nottoo few jobs but too few skills.&quot;   The report travels well-trod and debatable ground oneducation and policy toward children, and puts far too muchfaith in governments to solve the problems they've created(welfare dependency, for example). But the report is notablefor paying attention to the economic potential of two groupsoften overlooked by politicians -- immigrants and theelderly.   The report calls flatly for increasing the number ofimmigrants allowed into the U.S., and especially those withusable skills. Right now, U.S. immigration policy puts apriority on reuniting families. That sometimes means talentedbut striving individuals get squeezed out. It can take monthsor years for a company to get a visa to transfer a foreignnational here. The report calls for immigration laws thatallow &quot;adequate flexibility for rapid adjustments to changinglabor markets.&quot;   As for economics, CED concludes that immigration islargely a boon. Take California. Without immigrants, thatfast-growing state might have faced a shortage of some 80,000workers in the 1980s. Immigrants contributed more than 25% tothe state's job growth. Maybe someone should jetpack thesefacts to Wyoming's Republican Senator Alan Simpson, who'sdoing his best to kill immigration reform this year.   Other laws needing reform are those that tell olderAmericans they aren't wanted in the work force. The reportpoints out that today's retirement policies &quot;were developedduring the Great Depression when the primary concern was tocreate jobs for the young&quot; and protect the old fromdestitution. Life expectancy at the time was some 60 years,but now it's nearly 75. With fewer young people entering thework force now, it's ludicrous to treat the elderly as ifthey're only good for golf and bingo.   The report zeroes in on the perverse incentives of theSocial Security system. Social Security benefits have tripledin real terms since 1945, making retirement more attractive.Especially perverse are the &quot;earnings test&quot; and high-taxpolicies that punish a retiree by taking away benefits if heworks. A retiree working at McDonald's this year loses $1 inbenefits for every $3 of income earned above a piddling$9,340. House Democrats, led by Indiana's Andy Jacobs, won'teven let a repeal of this inane law come to a vote, so afraidare they of losing &quot;revenue.&quot;   The CED study has other good ideas for making better useof the elderly's skills, and we hope they set off a debate.The elderly, like immigrants, may just be America's secretweapon in the economic competition of the future.</TEXT></DOC>
