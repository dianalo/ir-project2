(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some people in the computer industrymistakenly blame computer ``viruses'' for anything that goes wrong,an independent computer security consultant says.   ``Out of over 1,400 complaints to the Software Service Bureauthis year, in only 2 percent of the cases was an electronic virusthe cause of the problem,'' Chrles Wood said. ``People are jumpingto the conclusion that whenever a system slows down, it's a virusthat's responsible.''   Wood and other panelists at a 15th annual computer securityconference cautioned that computer-dependent companies should focusmore on the day-to-day breakdowns caused by human error than on thekind of virus introduced recently into a government-supportedcomputer network.   Robert Morris Jr., a 23-year-old Cornell University graduatestudent, allegedly unleashed the virus in the nationwide6,200-computer government-supported network called Arpanet. He isthe subject of an inquiry by the FBI and U.S. attorneys in twostates.   That incident ``could be a cheap lesson,'' Steve Irwin, presidentof LeeMah Datacom Security Corp., said Monday. ``We were luckybecause it was not a real malicious attempt ... If Morris hadordered the programs to be erased, the loss could have gone intobillions, lots of zeroes.''   Wood said: ``The virus is the hot topic right now, but actuallythe real important subject is disaster recovery planning. But that'snot as glamorous as the viruses.''</TEXT></DOC>
