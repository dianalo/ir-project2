Terms of the contract proposal, which covered economicissues such as wages, vacations and cost-of-livingallowances, weren't disclosed. Both sides referred to theoffer, the first tabled by the company since negotiationsbegan last week, as a &quot;basis for further discussion.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   CAW President Robert White said Ford was moving in theright direction with its contract proposal. But he said theamount of money the company was offering was &quot;not even close&quot;to the union's demands. He said he doubted there was enoughtime to reach a settlement before the strike deadline. Thecurrent contract, covering 12,800 Ford workers, expirestomorrow.   Ford Canada spokesman James Hartford said a tentativecontract agreement before the strike deadline was&quot;achievable,&quot; but only with &quot;considerable effort.&quot;   &quot;One of the serious players here is the clock,&quot; Mr.Hartford said.   The CAW began contract talks last Wednesday afterselecting Ford as its strike target. Any contract reachedwill serve as a model for later talks with the Canadiansubsidiaries of General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
