But he vows his son never will work for the Italian maker of tires and cables.    &quot;Pirelli used to be a special place,&quot; Mr. Filiberti says. &quot;A job at Pirelli used to be a job for life.&quot; The pay also was better than in other industries, and the company even offered a private pension plan for workers, the first of its kind in Italy.    &quot;Now,&quot; Mr. Filiberti shrugs, &quot;it's a company like any other.&quot;    Pirelli can no longer afford to be special. Faced with competition that is growing but markets that aren't, it has dropped paternalism and adopted austerity. Last month it said it would slash 3,000 jobs from its 22,000-member Italian work force in the next two years. Only a quarter of the cuts will come through early retirement.    La Bicocca, a sprawling, ivy-covered factory complex that was opened in 1872 by the young engineer Giovanni Battista Pirelli to make bicycle tires, will be closed next year. And efforts are under way elsewhere to increase factory automation to limit labor costs.    At the same time, the company has been trying -- unsuccessfully -- to expand sales by buying market share in the U.S., the world's largest tire market. Pirelli last month made overtures to take over Firestone Tire andamp; Rubber Co., only to find that most of Firestone's tire operations were being sold to Japan's Bridgestone Corp. It was Pirelli's third thwarted effort to boost its U.S. presence in as many years.    &quot;Pirelli has already reached its maximum market share in Europe,&quot; says Massimo Campadese, a consultant at Booz-Allen andamp; Hamilton Italia Ltd. &quot;To increase volume, it has to go to the U.S.&quot;    At stake could be its standing as the world's No. 7 and Europe's No. 3 tire maker. As auto makers become global, tire makers are following. Because Pirelli exports only specialty tires to the U.S. and has no manufacturing operations there, it lacks brand-name recognition and needs a partner, analysts say. But with three acquisition targets -- Firestone, Armstrong Tire Co. and General Tire andamp; Rubber Co. already taken, few options are left.    Pirelli officials declined to be interviewed for this article, but last month they said the company &quot;has never concealed its interest&quot; in the U.S. market.    To be sure, it is less dependent on the tire business than its rivals, because tires account for only 44% of sales, compared with 92% for France's Cie. Generale des Ets. Michelin and 70% or more for most Japanese tire makers, according to Booz-Allen figures. An additional 40% of Pirelli's business comes from wires and cables, for which the company had 1986 sales of $1.85 billion. It also makes a variety of other products, ranging from transmission belts to tennis shoes.    But even that diversification has its problems, analysts say. &quot;Both tires and cables are mature sectors,&quot; says Milan stockbroker Franco Aletti. &quot;Pirelli was once a world leader in fiber-optical cables, but their rivals in America and Japan are catching up.&quot;    Pirelli's peculiar shareholding structure makes analyzing its performance difficult. A family-controlled limited partnership, Pirelli andamp; Co., owns stakes in two parent companies -- Pirelli S.p.A. of Milan and Societe Internationale Pirelli S.A. of Basel, Switzerland -- that, in turn, jointly own the group's operating subsidiaries, which are run through yet another jointly controlled management company, Pirelli Societe Generale S.A.    Because of the complex structure, Pirelli doesn't produce a consolidated balance sheet, but instead issues a so-called aggregate-income statement that, Mr. Aletti, the stockbroker, says, &quot;tells you everything and nothing.&quot; For 1986, aggregate sales grew to $4.74 billion from $3.67 billion a year earlier, while net income rose to $141 million from $101.5 million. Figures for 1987 will be out this month.    After a period of widening losses in the early 1980s, Pirelli's Italian division, Industrie Pirelli, has been posting strong gains, largely by reducing staff, stepping up automation and restructuring debt. Chairman Leopoldo Pirelli keeps a low profile, and changes at Pirelli come in stages.    Management's soft-pedal approach has had its advantages. Pirelli has pretty much been able to avoid the bruising union confrontations that have hit so many Italian companies. For instance, in 1985 its unions agreed to relinquish their vaunted pension plan in return for job security.    &quot;Pirelli isn't like Fiat, where they fired 25,000 people in one day (in 1980),&quot; says Roberto Allevi, a Communist union official at Bicocca. Despite the company's plan to lay off 3,000 people, workers realize they must cooperate with management to protect as many jobs as possible, he says.    Adds Mr. Filiberti, the second-generation employee at Bicocca: &quot;We have to take into account that this is a competitive industry.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
