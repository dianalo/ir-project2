 In fact, the secret to an appropriatesecurity and disaster recovery plan lies in evaluating those assets.andP;  In mostcases, the cost of disaster recovery services or security hardware andsoftware is more than justified by the potential harm that could result.andM;Such a plan is more than just a piece of paper that MIS managers can use tosoothe the concerns of top management and convince underwriters to provide adiscount on a data processing insurance policy.andP;  A system that's dead in thewater after a disaster, combined with a recovery plan that can't be used, caneasily cost a company a substantial portion of its income.andM;Take the case of one major bank after the San Francisco earthquake on Oct.andO;17.andP;  At that time, the bank was forced to shut down while police sealed offits headquarters for three days to inspect the building for structuraldamage.andM;Although the bank had a disaster recovery plan calling for relocating itssystems operations to a remote site, it could not find a way to transport itsemployees to the alternative processing site in the aftermath of theearthquake.andP;  As a result, daily business operations at that location werebrought to a standstill and overall losses amounted to 25 percent of thebank's daily revenues.andM;According to a 1988 University of Texas study, the cost of a computer outageto a company that lacks a recovery plan can run much higher.andP;  In the study,160 companies in a variety of industries estimated their losses would be 2.5times greater without a recovery policy than with one.andM;While the average percentage of daily loss varies by they type of industry,the loss rate at the onset of a computer outage is greatest for banking andfinancial services companies, and lowest for the service industry, accordingto the study conducted by the University of Texas' Center for Research onInformation Systems.andM;By the sixth day of an outage, revenues for a typical company--for allindustries--decline by 25 percent on average, according to the study.andO;Overall, a typical company could lose more than two full days of revenues bythe 10th day of a continued outage.andP;  Thus, a company making $250 million inrevenues could lose more than $2 million by the 10th day.andM;In addition to losing potential revenues, businesses whose systems are downcould lose money by having to spend more to perform basic tasks thatpreviously were automated.andP;  According to the University of Texas study, thesecost increases can range from more than 2 percent for the first day of theoutage to nearly 14 percent by the 10th day.andP;  In many cases, the loss ofcomputer operations will prevent tasks from being completed.andP;  In the Texasstudy, 75 percent of the companies surveyed reported serious or worseimpairment by the fifth day.andP;  By the 15th day, 80 percent reported asubstantial loss or a total loss of ability to perform basic business tasks.andM;Although losses most frequently stem from interrupted cash flow, the studyfound that other factors, such as losing a competitive edge and the erosionof a company's public image in the wake of a long outage, can contribute to asagging bottom line in the aftermath of a disaster.andM;A disaster recovery plan is not only a cost-avoidance measure, but it canserve as an instrument of cost savings as well.andP;  For example, an MIS managerwith a working disaster recovery plan can often negotiate lower rates forprotecting his computing installation.andM;A data processing insurance policy may or may not include special coveragefor business interruption in the event of fire, flooding or other events.andO;Rates for a policy that includes business interruption may be reduced 10percent to 20 percent for users with disaster recovery plans.andP;  For thoseusers with a disaster recovery plan and general data processing insurancewith no business-interruption coverage, rates can be reduced 5 percent to 10percent.andM;DAMAGE CONTROLandM;Since the loss of data needed for company operations can be a majorcontributor to lost productivity following a disaster, the first step in adisaster recovery plan is to establish an off-site data backup.andM;Off-site data storage for a modest VAX shop runs from $300 to $800 per month,according to data from Rothstein Associates, a consulting company inOssining, N.Y.andP;  This figure varies based on the volume of data backed up, thefrequency of pickups and deliveries of backup media, and how long the backupmedia are stored off-site.andM;Numerous companies provide vault services.andP;  According to DEC, the averagecost to store one to 50 magnetic tapes is roughly $4.33 per tape per month.andO;Average storage costs for as many as 10,000 magnetic tapes are $2.40 per tapeper month.andP;  Disk storage costs a bit more.andP;  Storing one to 10 small diskscosts about $12.10 per disk per month.andP;  Storing one to 10 medium-sized diskscosts around $22 per disk per month, and storing one to 10 large disks costsapproximately $30 per disk per month.andM;However, data alone will do a company little good if its computer systems areinoperable.andP;  The next step in a recovery plan is to prepare an alternatecomputing site in case the first is destroyed or becomes unusabletemporarily.andP;  A number of third-party vendors will contract with computersites to provide computer services on short notice in case of emergency.andO;These arrangements come in two types, called hot sites and cold sites.andM;A hot site has backup data facilities and computer systems already in place.andO;A cold site is an empty, air-conditioned facility that can accommodate thesubscriber's system or replacement system.andM;Hot-site monthly subscription costs are based on system configuration.andP;  A hotsite for a business with a VAX cluster with multiple systems can range from$800 per month to $15,000 per month.andP;  Cold sites can cost as little as $200per month.andP;  But these subscription fees ensure merely that a site will beavailable for the customer's use.andP;  Once a hot or cold site is reserved for anemergency, additional daily costs, such as one-time disaster declarationfees, can be charged to the customer.andP;  The disaster declaration feeeffectively reserves the hot site for the customer's use.andP;  This fee can rangefrom a low of $5,000 to as much as $30,000, according to a study by McWainsChelsea, a consulting company based in Morristown, N.J.andM;For example, one disaster recovery vendor charges between $4,500 per monthand $6,000 per month for subscription fees for a DEC VAX 8700 or 8810 with astandard peripheral configuration and communications.andP;  Those samesubscription fees could be as low as $1,500 per month for a modest 8350configuration to as much as a $8,000 per month for a high-end 8800.andP;  Thedisaster declaration fee for the high-end 8800 configuration would be about$7,500.andM;Other backup alternatives are less costly than hot sites.andP;  Service bureaus,for instance, provide immediate access to time-sharing services.andP;  However,these services are available for just a short period with limited databasesecurity.andM;If a company doesn't find any of these options fiscally appealing, it couldchoose to develop shared contingency agreements with other companies.andP;  Thesecontracts involve a reciprocal arrangement with another data processingcenter to provide service to one another in an emergency.andM;Although these contracts are generally much less expensive than contractingfor a third-party site, they can have some definite disadvantages.andP;  First,rarely will two companies have identical configurations, and a company hit bya disaster might not have the time or resources to test or reconfigure itspartner's system.andP;  Second, because the partner whose system is unaffected bythe disaster has first priority for use of its own equipment, the affectedcompany probably will not be able to resume full-capacity operations.andM;Implementing a disaster recovery plan also requires some committed staffing.andO;Initial implementation for a mid-sized VAX shop requires from three to nineman-months, according to the Rothstein study.andP;  After the recovery plan hasbeen implemented, on-going maintenance, reviews and testing will requireapproximately 60 man-days per year.andM;While some companies choose to develop their recovery plans in-house, othersbring in consultants.andP;  These consultants' billing, rates range from $600 to$1,200 or more per day.andP;  According to Rothstein, the total cost of having aconsultant involved in preparing a disaster recovery plan usually fallsbetween $15,000 for an advisory role and $100,000 or more for it to do mostof the work.andP;  In most cases, it is cheaper to develop and implement plansin-house than to hire a consultant.andM;TAKING A BYTE OUT OF CRIMEandM;The acts of man, as well as nature, can take their toll.andP;  According to theNational Center for Computer Crime Data, U.S.andP;  businesses lost more than $550million last year, not including personnel costs and downtime, to criminalactivity.andP;  Adapso, the Arlington, Va.-based software industry tradeassociation, suggests that overall losses are much greater.andP;  Adapso reportedthat losses due to computer crime amount to billions of dollars, but mostlosses are never reported.andM;The Adapso report said that most assaults on a company's information securitycome from within.andP;  At least 70 percent of computer security problems areemployee-related, the report said, but the majority of these problems arecaused by honest employees who are badly trained, poorly supervised orgreatly stressed.andP;  Dishonest employees form the next largest group ofsecurity risks, and disgruntled employees form the third biggest group.andM;Because so much computer fraud is perpetrated internally, computer securityhas become a management issue, not just a computing issue.andP;  Establishing ahigh-level security policy that protects MIS assets from both fraud andnatural disasters is no more than prudent and no less than absolutelynecessary for most businesses.andM;Take the case of a prominent New York law firm that represented some majorWall Street brokerage companies and suffered both monetary losses andcredibility problems when a dishonest employee hacked into its case files.andO;The employee was able to obtain inside information about several publiclytraded companies when he broke a computer security code and accessedunauthorized files.andM;The Securities and Exchange Commission demanded an investigation, which costthe company about $40,000.andP;  Although the firm was not at fault, its publicimage was tarnished, costing it clients and revenues.andM;A crisis plan that will prevent costly occurrences such as the one abovebegins with a risk analysis to determine system vulnerabilities.andM;A formal risk analysis, which should be updated annually, includes twomatrixes.andP;  The first is a dependency matrix that shows who is dependent onwhom for what information, from the user who initiates a certain systemapplication to the user who rely on that data in one form or another.andM;The second matrix is a financial impact matrix.andP;  This chart assigns afinancial value to each person, in order of importance, who uses a specificapplication.andP;  This generates the risk analysis report.andP;  Ideally, this reportwill illuminate the company's three most critical applications and outlinethe cost to the company if these applications are compromised.andM;These often will be key applications that affect core business operations.andP;  Afinancial services business would be affected most severely by the loss ofits cash management applications.andP;  A transportation company would be hithardest by the loss of its asset scheduling system, and a manufacturer wouldbe devastated by the loss of its inventory and order entry system.andM;Another approach to risk analysis entails examining the weakest links in asystem.andP;  Since the most important goals of a computer security system are toensure secrecy, integrity and availability, anywhere that one of those goalscould be lost is a point of vulnerability.andM;Once those weak points have been established, the next step is to determinethe likelihood of their occurrence.andP;  Insurance companies often can supplyvast amounts of data from which the chances of a fire, flood or even employeefraud can be determined.andP;  A second way to determine risk is to develop ahistorical record of failures, unauthorized access attempts or otheranomalies that would affect system security.andM;With the weak points specified and their likelihood of occurrence determined,the final step is to estimate the cost of each occurrence.andP;  For example,unauthorized access to data could cause the loss of future businessopportunities or provide a competitor with an unfair advantage.andP;  The cost ofreplacing automated procedures with slower, manual methods could be computed,or the loss of data and the cost to reconstruct it could be calculated.andM;Personnel costs might also figure into a risk analysis.andP;  For example, if thesystem that supports the shipping department of a manufacturing company goesdown, for all practical purposes, so does that department.andP;  Thus, the hourlywages of those employees, as well as the costs incurred due to shippingdelays, could be included as part of the uncovered cost.andM;Compared to the potential expense of a security failure, the cost ofmaintaining workable and appropriate security measures is, like disasterrecovery, relatively cheap.andM;Changing users' passwords at least once a month is the simplest,least-expensive way to achieve systematic user accountability.andP;  In the wordsof one security expert, &quot;The memorized password is still the biggest villainof computer crime.&quot;andM;Establishing a more complex user identification system can involve addingaudit trails to the software.andP;  Often, the administrative controls provided byVMS alone offer sufficient security.andP;  Auditing software that notes changes tothe system or its software can also be purchased.andM;Another cheap way to prevent problems is frequently changing the parametersof software responsible for signaling system anomalies.andP;  For example, a bankwith a system that flags account transfers over a certain amounts shouldchange the alarm amount regularly.andP;  This would enable MIS personnel to spotmachinations that would otherwise go unnoticed.andM;At the hardware end, user authentication devices such as smart cards can alsoscreen system access.andP;  Smart cards have already made their mark in Europe andare just beginning to take hold in the United States.andP;  Thesecredit-card-sized devices contain a microprocessor, a memory chip and limitedI/O.andP;  The microprocessor can be preprogrammed for a certain calculation to beused as an authentication measure.andM;The memory chip can contain personal user data such as name, photo,signature, personal identification number (PIN), a fingerprint, voice print,eye scan or DNA code.andP;  A smart card can also keep an audit trail similar to asoftware audit trail, by which every transaction is recorded in the chip.andM;A smart card is used with a card reader box that is attached to a user'sterminal.andP;  The host system also has an identification code and can identifythe user's identification code or PIN when the card is passed through thereader to allow for system access.andM;Smart cards can be reissued if lost or stolen, and are priced at $10 to $50,depending upon the chip's power.andP;  Smart card readers can cost from $200 to$1,000 per computer terminal.andM;Call-back modems are another hardware device that can be used to preventunauthorized access.andP;  These modems identify the user calling in, then hang upand dial the user back at a previously specified number.andP;  These devices canalso provide complete call logs.andP;  Secure modems range in price fromapproximately $3,000 to $7,000.andM;Finally, devices that provide encryption at rates of 64Kbits per second canprotect against wiretaps and microwave links.andP;  These devices costapproximately $2,000 to $5,000.andP;  Higher-speed encryption devices for a T1backbone network cost $10,000 and up.andM;Finally, on the outer limits of system security are biometric securitydevices that measure a person's physical traits, such as the ridges of afingerprint, speech patterns or even signature keystrokes.andP;  A biometricdescription of the person is scanned by sensor devices and converted intodigital data and stored.andP;  Before users can log in to the system, the devicechecks their fingerprint or other physical trait against its records to seethat the users are authorized.andM;Such devices are considered highly reliable sources of authenticity:Fingerprints or nuances of pronunciation are difficult to duplicate and can'tbe misplaced or stolen.andM;Prices for biometric authentication devices range from $2,000 for a signatureverification system and $5,000 for a fingerprint reader to $15,000 or $20,000for a voice recognition system that accommodates 1,000 users.andM;High-security utensils such as these are not for everyone.andP;  But almost anysystem can benefit from an investment in a security and disaster recoverytechnique.andM;Protecting company computers and data is a basic, necessary part of MISoperations.andP;  An extensive recovery and security plan is often overlooked oris little more than a paper tiger, but the costs of protecting a system fromacts of man and nature is cheap insurance against MIS nightmares.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
