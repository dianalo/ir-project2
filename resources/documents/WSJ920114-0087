The three words were among the finalists in Pfizer Inc.'sthree-year struggle to name an antidepressant drug to competewith Eli Lilly andamp; Co.'s best-selling Prozac.   But despite the time and costs involved -- which includedgenerating hundreds of possibilities and hiring a namedevelopment company -- not everyone is thrilled with Zoloft,the final selection. &quot;It's about a six&quot; out of 10, concedesColin Edwards, a Pfizer team leader in international productdevelopment. &quot;It's not something everybody hears and says,`Oooh, yes, that's good.' The best we hear is `That's notbad.'&quot;   These days, Pfizer's frustrating hunt is far from unusual.Since the passage of the trademark reform law in 1988, thenumber of trademark applications filed annually has swelled,reaching more than 127,000 last year, up 66% from the recordbefore the law took effect. Increased competition fromforeign entrants is one factor. According to Delano Goldman andamp;Young Inc., a New York name development firm, the number offoreign applications has jumped 61% since 1987. Japanesecompanies filed a record 2,412 last year, up from the 1,000range in previous years.   The numbers are forcing marketing executives to stretchtheir imaginations and their resources to the limits,searching for catchy names that stand apart. &quot;There are55,000-plus words in Webster's Dictionary, {but} mosteducated people have a command of only 20,000 of these words,at best,&quot; says Frank Delano, chairman of Delano Goldman.&quot;There aren't many comprehensible words left.&quot;   In the pharmaceuticals category alone, more than 600registered and pending trademarks begin with the prefix&quot;pro.&quot; &quot;A good name that suggests the use and nature of theproduct is very difficult or impossible to come by thesedays,&quot; says Pfizer's Dr. Edwards.   As a result, companies are devoting more resources tofinding a free name. Taking the proper legal steps andaggressively making sure no one else is using a name can costup to $10,000 a year. Name consultant Lippincott andamp; MarguliesInc., New York, says it generates an average 500 candidatesfor every name, compared with 300 options a few years ago.&quot;We waste a lot of time and legal fees fencing rather thantending to business,&quot; complains a pharmaceuticals companyexecutive.   Companies do get lucky once in a while. RJR NabiscoHoldings Corp., for example, had little trouble coming upwith the name Zings for a new z-shaped cracker. The companyhad filed the name years ago for another product. Althoughthe registration had lapsed, no one else had picked it up.   But the name game is particularly burdensome for smaller,newer companies that haven't laid claim to names before andsometimes lack the resources to aggressively defend existingbrands. &quot;I know many small companies that are chased out of aparticular concept simply by the threat of an action from aFortune 500 company,&quot; says Jonah Shacknai, chairman and chiefexecutive of Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp., which holdsregular monthly sessions to come up with new names.   Many blame the new trademark laws for their problems --laws intended to help assuage the worsening crunch. Before1989, companies had to demonstrate active commercial use of aname before applying for the mark. Soon, many found thatsending an item with a dummy label across a state linesatisfied the legal requirement. Some used the method toaccumulate &quot;banks&quot; of names, often to keep competitors fromsnapping up the names first.   The new law relaxes the requirement and tries to eliminatename banks. Applicants may file on the basis of a &quot;bona fideintent&quot; to use a mark, but actual use must be demonstratedbefore the name can be registered officially. To weed outexisting name banks, the law requires that the registrationsbe renewed every 10 years instead of every 20.   But critics argue that intent-to-use is a slipperystandard that allows applicants to deluge the trademarkoffice with numerous names without worrying about creatingdummy products. While marks can't be fully registered withoutproof that they're being actively used, preliminaryapplications can sit for up to four years before they'rediscarded. &quot;A company can have three or four names in mindand, if in their minds they can satisfy themselves that theyare meeting the standard, they can file three applicationsand see how they make out,&quot; says Allan S. Pilson, a partnerat Ladas andamp; Parry in New York.   In the cosmetics and beauty industries, where the battlefor a new romantic, sexy or exotic name has always beenfierce, executives at New Jersey-based Parlux Fragrances Inc.are struggling to come up with a name for a new perfume bydesigner Albert Nipon. The company selected 10 possible namesthat weren't being used but later realized that half hadalready been registered by others. &quot;In our business, peopletend to hold onto what they have, if only to keep it fromsomebody else,&quot; notes Vice Chairman Fred Purches.   As the playing field grows more crowded, companies findthemselves taking more risks, allowing names to edge closerto each other than they otherwise would have. Delano Goldmansays the Clairol Inc. unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.devoted years trying to come up with a name for a hair colorproduct currently in development. After throwing out morethan 300 possibilities because of potential conflicts,Clairol finally registered two finalists -- Affluence andWhipsical -- despite concern that the words were similar totrademarks in other classifications. &quot;Some companies aretaking more risks than they would have felt comfortable within the past,&quot; says Vincent Palladino, partner at Fish andamp;Neave, a law firm specializing in intellectual property.   That trend means a lot more work for trademark lawyers.&quot;Everytime we come out with a new vehicle or name, somebodythreatens us with a suit,&quot; says Kenneth D. Enborg, theattorney in charge of trademark litigation at General MotorsCorp. He estimates that his department's legal work has morethan doubled in recent years, keeping the administrativelitigation staff of 15 busy. The company is currentlyappealing a judge's summary decision against its Saturndivision in a case brought by a tire company claiming thename, and is fending off litigation threats from German automaker Mercedes Benz AG over the use of the initials &quot;SE&quot; onsome car models.   GM's Oldsmobile recently scrapped two car names -- Destinyand Presidio -- because of foreign registrants. And expertssee no relief for companies in the future. &quot;It's becomingmore difficult for Acme Widget Co. coming into themarketplace,&quot; says Roger E. Schechter, a law professor atGeorge Washington University. &quot;A company bringing a newproduct into existence in 1994 will really be up against awall.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
