The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 7.83 points to3240.61. But the broader market slipped: Standard andamp; Poor's500-stock index lost 0.49 to 414.99; the New York StockExchange Composite Index edged down 0.23 to 228.94; and theNasdaq Composite Index fell 3.68 to 621.00.</LP><TEXT>   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by 890-831 on the BigBoard, where volume fell to 190,430,000 shares from213,600,000 Friday.   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index lost 0.94to 412.48. Advancing issues edged out decliners 307-306.   &quot;The activity was a little lighter than it has been,&quot; saidLarry Greenwald, head trader at Sanford Bernstein. &quot;Peopleare waiting for President Bush's State of the Union address.They're wondering whether we should continue to rotate&quot; outof growth stocks and into economically sensitive cyclicalstocks.   Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisersin New York, warns that &quot;during bull markets, presidentialspeeches have been known to be rallykillers&quot; becauseinvestors' high expectations are easily disappointed.   In the case of tonight's State of the Union address, leakssuggest that Mr. Bush will use the speech to fire the openingshots in a battle with Congress over a fiscal stimuluspackage that could include cuts in the capital gains tax andother incentives for investors.   Stock investors could be disappointed if these proposalsfall short of expectations, and they might see that as areason to take profits on stocks that have soared in the pastmonth.   Against that backdrop, yesterday's continued migration tocyclical stocks suggests that &quot;we're setting ourselves up fora short-term correction,&quot; said Tim Love, a portfolio managerat Marinvest, a unit of Hong Kong andamp; Shanghai Bank. &quot;Themarket is anticipating far too much far too quickly.&quot;   After this predicted correction, &quot;investors would proceedselectively into cyclicals,&quot; he said. &quot;They'd be looking forgood underlying fundamentals&quot; in selective stocks rather thansnapping up a broad range of economically sensitive issues.   Some of those selections appeared to be playing outyesterday, as shares of home builders showed strength.Louisiana Pacific gained 1 to 54 5/8 after announcingfourth-quarter earnings of 24 cents a share, in line withanalysts' expectations. Ryland Group added 1 5/8 to 26 1/4,Kaufman andamp; Broad rose 7/8 to 20 1/4, and Standard Pacificmoved up 3/4 to 13.   Home builders have &quot;some fundamentals going their way,&quot;Mr. Love said, such as low interest rates and high demand forsingle-family dwellings.   Christopher Pedersen, head trader at Twenty-FirstSecurities, suggested that a surge in automobile stocks was asimilarly selective cyclical bet. &quot;The Big Three {U.S. automakers} have been trashed, and they're undervalued,&quot; he said.&quot;The money going into them is smart long-term money.&quot;   Chrysler led auto stocks with a 1 1/2-point surge to 15 onvolume of three million shares, about three times its dailyaverage. Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippiupgraded the stock to a &quot;buy&quot; from a &quot;hold&quot; because of itsnew products. Ford Motor jumped 1 to 32 3/4, and GeneralMotors gained 1 3/8 to 34 1/8.   Securities brokers, on the other hand, lost ground aftertheir strong run last week. PaineWebber fell 1 1/8 to 23 7/8;Merrill Lynch lost 2 1/2 to 61 1/8 -- though the firmreported record earnings for 1991 -- and Morgan Stanley fell1 1/4 to 61 3/4.   MBIA lost 1 5/8 to 45 1/4. The company, which insuresmunicipal bonds, announced it had filed with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission a proposed offering of 8.2 millioncommon shares; 1.5 million new shares will be offered by thecompany, and the rest will be sold by institutional MBIAholders. As a result of the offering, 33.4 million shares, or83.5% of the company, will be held publicly. The underwritingwill be led by Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette and ShearsonLehman Brothers. MBIA also announced fourth-quarter earningsof $1.03 a share, in line with analysts' expectations.   Ivax jumped 2 3/8 to 38.

ScheringPlough's world-wide pharmaceutical sales jumped12% last year, while its health-care products sales gained17%.   Promus lost 1 1/2 to 27 5/8.
