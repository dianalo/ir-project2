Michel Aoun and his Syrian foes were preparingfor major battle.   People streamed from the bomb-ravaged capital during a lull incombat to avoid what Moslem bank employee Nabil Masri called ``theworst, which is yet to come.''   ``There is talk all over Lebanon that they are preparing foreither a long confrontation or a final battle. We don't want to behere in either case,'' said Masri, who was interviewed in Moslemwest Beirut.   He said he was taking his wife and three children to settle in arented apartment in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.   A police spokesman said no casualties were reported in Tuesday'sfiring along confrontation lines in Beirut and the nearby mountains.   Five months of artillery duels between Aoun's 20,000predominantly Christian troops and Syria's 40,000 soldiers deployedin west Beirut and other mainly Moslem sectors of Lebanon havekilled 549 people and wounded 1,322.   All but 200,000 of Beirut's 1.5 million residents have fled tosafer areas in south Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley ornortheastern mountain resorts.   The newspaper An-Nahar said Syria has ``decided to fight a warof attrition in Lebanon to achieve its aim of taming the Christiancamp.''   The independent daily said Syrian officials informed theirleftist and Lebanese Moslem allies that President Hafez Assad'sDamascus government ``will not accept any dialogue with Gen. Aoununder any circumstances.''   Aoun, 54, a Maronite Catholic, has declared a ``war ofliberation'' to drive Syrian forces from territories they havecontrolled since 1976.   An-Nahar said Syrian troops may try to ``storm through'' the310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of Beirut to toppleAoun.   Sources from Druse chief Walid Jumblatt's Progressive SocialistParty militia, Syria's main ally against Aoun, said the Christianscould try to break into Syrian-controlled territory.   One ranking source said Aoun has ``massed tanks and troops foran operation across the traditional front line.''   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.   More than a week ago, a three-member Arab League committee saidits two-month mediation effort here resulted in an impasse andblamed Syria for blocking the initiative. Political deadlockfollowed.   The foreign ministers of Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Algeria saidthey would report back to see if they should try to reactivate themission.   An Arab summit last May 26 asked King Hassan II of Morocco, KingFahd of Saudi Arabia and President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria towork out a Lebanon peace settlement by November.   U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy told reporters after a meetingwith Aoun that the Bush administration has urged the Arab leadersto pursue their efforts.   Outgoing President Amin Gemayel in September appointed Aoun tolead an interim Christian Cabinet that would rule pending electionof a new head of state.   Moslems and leftists rejected this appointment and pledgedallegiance to acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads theMoslem Cabinet vying for legitimacy with Aoun's.   The latest round of fighting broke out in March after Aounblockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south ofBeirut, trying to salvage about $100 million lost annually incustoms fees.   Syrian and allied forces retaliated by shelling the Christianenclave, home to about 1 million people.</TEXT></DOC>
