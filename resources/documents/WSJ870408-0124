In truth, juries decide only a small percentage of personal-injury claims and, with few exceptions, are generally consistent and conservative in the awards they render. Research consistently shows that they are far less generous toward plaintiffs than final settlement offers and arbitration panels are.    &quot;Some 98% of the millions of insurance claims filed each year are settled . . . only 2% cannot be resolved without litigation,&quot; reports William E. Bailey in the Winter 1987 issue of The Brief, a magazine of the American Bar Association. He is special counsel to the Insurance Information Institute for tort liability issues.    State Farm Insurance Cos., which covers one-fifth of all insured automobiles in the U.S., reports similar litigation statistics for the automobile-insurance industry. &quot;We can argue that of the 31 million auto accidents occurring annually, only 1.61% wind up in litigation,&quot; says Leo J. Jordan, the insurer's associate general counsel.    Of the claims that are litigated, Mr. Bailey estimates that 92% are settled before trial and 4.5% are settled during the early stages of trial. This means that only 3.5% are tried to a verdict.    A total of 866,000 personal-injury tort lawsuits were resolved in 1985, according to the Institute for Civil Justice, a division of Rand Corp. If 3.5% of these lawsuits ended in jury decisions, as is estimated, then 30,310 verdicts were rendered in 1985. Jurors awarded nothing in 40% of these cases, according to Jury Verdict Research, a percentage that has not fluctuated more than three points in a quarter-century. When jurors do award compensation to plaintiffs, a majority of those awards for specific injuries consistently fall within a 25% range above or below the median jury award.    In contrast, there is usually great disparity between plaintiff demands and defense offers, and there is frequently little correlation among demands, offers and jury awards. In fact, plaintiffs and defendants often would be better off reaching prompt settlements rather than taking chances on jury verdicts. A recent Jury Verdict Research analysis of 443 jury awards in back and neck cases, which are a category frequently handled by attorneys, reveals that only one final settlement offer in six was within 25% of the actual jury award. Nearly a quarter of the final offers were 26% to 600% greater than the jury awards. Only one final settlement demand in six was within 25% of the jury award, but more than half of the final demands were 26% to 1,100% greater than the verdict.    Similar trends can be seen in the decisions of arbitration panels, which are usually made up of attorneys. A major insurance company reports in an in-house study prepared by Jury Verdict Research that arbitration panels found for the defendant in only 5% of all cases. The report also says that arbitrators awarded an average of three times more than jurors for similar claims.    Last month, an arbitration panel of three attorneys awarded one of the largest accidental-death awards ever rendered -- $13 million to the wife of a man who was killed when a car hit the bicycle he was riding. The attorney arbitrators were selected by the dead man's estate and two insurance companies.    Many critics refer to &quot;million-dollar verdicts&quot; as though they are typical of jurors' awards. However, only 2,564 verdicts of $1 million or more have been reported since 1962. Wrongful-death claims represented 22% of these awards, followed by 20% for brain damage, 15% for spinal-cord injuries, and 8% for arm and/or leg amputations.    Juries nationwide rendered 488 verdicts of $1 million or more in 1985; they constituted only 1.61% of the estimated 30,310 personal-injury awards for that year. Injuries resulting from medical malpractice accounted for 79 of the &quot;million-dollar verdicts.&quot; However, plaintiffs recovered money in an average of only 38% of all medical malpractice cases. Product liability claims resulted in 83 of the million-dollar verdicts, and plaintiffs won monetary awards in an average of 57% of all product liability cases.    Verdicts considered excessive may be reduced by court action or post-trial settlements, which often yield a fraction of the original award. A study of 198 million-dollar awards by the American Trial Lawyers Association (ATLA) in 1986 shows that the verdicts totaled $790.6 million. However, the amount actually paid out was $339.2 million, or 43% of the verdict.    Although overall verdict amounts have increased, the rate of increase is less than the rise in major health-care costs. These costs are vital elements in personal-injury verdicts. According to the U.S. Health Care Financing Administration, the cost of in-patient, outpatient and physician care has risen an average of 15.8% from 1978 to 1984. During the same period, verdict amounts rose an average of only 12.9%.    Even if all juries rendered &quot;runaway&quot; verdicts, this would represent only a small percentage of all personal-injury compensation. It is not plausible that juries have been a significant, direct cause of the insurance crisis. Moreover, lawyers and insurers often overestimate the generosity of jurors, with final offers and demands showing little correlation with what jurors actually award for specific injuries and liabilities. When blame is apportioned for the crisis, some must go to the lawyers and insurers.    ---   Mr. Hermann, an attorney, is founder and chairman of Jury Verdict Research, a legal research and publishing company based in Solon, Ohio. </TEXT></DOC>
