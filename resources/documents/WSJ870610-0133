The FDIC provided Security Bank with $225,000 in cash and purchased $542,000 in bad loans. The agency acted after Missouri banking authorities reported that Security Bank was in danger of failing.    Security Bank, which has assets of $12.9 million and deposits of $12.7 million, continued operating without interruption of service.    Generally, the FDIC provides assistance only when a bank has failed. But occasionally it helps keep a bank open, if officials find that is the least costly alternative. So far this year, it has assisted four banks in danger of failing; 85 banks nationwide have failed. </TEXT></DOC>
