The release of asbestos by agingand deteriorated ACM is known to be episodic, relating to a myriad offactors such as activity within the area, vibration, temperature, humidity,airflow, use patterns, etc. Hopefully, for the majority of buildingscontaining ACM, fiber release is minimal. If a building contains asbestosand releases occur, the custodial worker may be most intensely affectedover the long term. If a release occurs, much of the asbestos will eventuallysettle and attach to the surfaces of the rooms (walls, furnishings, equipment,floors, and carpet). The preliminary analysis of dusty environments ispresented for the micro-vac, sonification, and passive-air-current samplingmethodologies.</TEXT></DOC>
