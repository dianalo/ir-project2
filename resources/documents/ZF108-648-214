(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>COBOL is one of the oldest and largest programming languages, but it's takena long time for full implementations of it to reach the PC environment.andO;Initial versions contained only the basic level-1 ANSI features; the highpoint of most implementations was indexed file 1/0.andP;  Over the past fiveyears, COBOL implementations have matured to include the entire language andall optional features specified in the ANS' X3.23 1985 COBOL standard.andM;The five products reviewed here are complete development systems and includethe compiler, a debugger, file-restructuring programs, and optionalutilities.andP;  All but one have a program editor, and three have integrateddevelopment environments.andM;Ryan McFarland, Microsoft, Micro Focus, mbp, and ACUCOBOL sent copies oftheir latest products for review.andP;  Realia was contacted but declined to senda review copy, saying its product was under development and not ready fortesting.andM;Since execution speed of generated code isn't usually a criterion forselecting a COBOL development system, I've refrained from comparisons of thistype, All the products returned acceptable compilation and execution timings,with the three native-code compilers obviously turning in much better timingsthan the pseudocode products.andM;Ryan McFarland Corp. RM/COBOL-85 v. 4.10.02andM;Ryan McFarland's latest offering sticks to the high standards I've grown toexpect in the almost 10 years I've been using the company's products.andP;  Thecompiler is a GSA-certified high implementation of ANSI X3.23-1985 COBOL withextensions and supports all optional features of the language except reportwriter and debugger.andP;  The communications division is supported, butimplementing the message-control system is left to the application developerand is addressed by the eight-page &quot;TechNotes&quot; in the users guide.andP;  The &quot;TechNotes&quot; also give sufficient information for knowledgeable programmers todesign and implement a message-control system.andM;The package consists of three diskettes containing the compiler, run-timeinterpreter, utility programs, users guide, and language reference manual,each in a three-ring binder with slipcover.andP;  A 44-page syntax summary coverscompiler, run-time, and debugger commands.andP;  The RM/CO* package consists of asingle diskette and a 136-page, spiral-bound users guide.andM;The compiler users guide contains information for compiling and executingprograms, as well as information on the utility programs provided with thecompiler.andP;  In addition to a separate installation section, in-depth coverageis provided for the ACCEPT and DISPLAY statements, file types and structures,assembly language subprograms, and instrumentation (a profiling subsystem).andO;An entire chapter is devoted to comparing RM/COBOL-85 with RM/ COBOL 2.n,showing compilation and run-time differences.andP;  Noticeably lacking is asection on writing efficient programs.andP;  You won't find any discussionconcerning efficiency of data types and control structures.andP;  In addition tothe common &quot;Language Concepts&quot; chapters that cover environment, data, andprocedure-division verbs, the language reference manual discusses internaldata formats and syntax differences between RM/COBOL-85 and RM/COBOL 2.n.andM;After reading the separate installation section in the users guide, I pluggedin the disks, typed in my COPY command, and promptly got a general failureerror.andP;  I've never received blank disks in a distribution package before, soI immediately assumed something was wrong with my disk drive.andP;  Funny, I'dused it just the day before to install Microsoft COBOL.andP;  On another system,though, I got the same results.andP;  The disks were blank.andP;  After three telephonecalls to Ryan McFarland on Friday afternoon, a phone call to Larry O'Brien atCOMPUTER LANGUAGE on Monday, and two return phone calls from Ryan McFarlandon Monday and Wednesday, I got my replacement disks via Federal Express onThursday morning.andP;  Evidently the distribution department had a problem withits disk duplicator.andP;  Whatever the cause of the error, if I'd been a payingcustomer waiting an entire week for replacement disks, I would have beenlivid.andM;Installation of the RM/COBOL package is the easiest of all the compilersreviewed here.andP;  You simply copy the contents of four diskettes into adirectory on your hard disk and follow the bouncing ball in the manual.andO;(They suggest C:\APPS\RMCOBOL or some such nonsense.andP;  I just used C:\RMC andeverything worked fine.) The RM/CO* introduction leads you through the fullrange of available features (including project creation, compiling, editing,and debugging a verification suite) intended to assure the user thateverything works as well as demonstrating the features of the developmentenvironment.andP;  The contents of the four disks, including examples, requiredslightly less than 1MB on my hard disk.andM;The RM/CO* Advanced Development Environment consists of a project manager andeditor, and it interfaces to the RM/COBOL-85 compiler, run time, anddebugger.andP;  The debugger interface provides source-level debugging, atremendous improvement over the DEBUG style of the default debugger providedwith the standard development system.andP;  The documentation is well written andthe onscreen help is informative if not entirely self-explanatory.andM;At program startup, the project directory lets you select or create projects.andO;Once you select a project, you enter the project manager.andP;  At the ProjectManager screen, you can add or drop files from the project and use the editorto create and modify program files, syntax-check programs, compile, anddebug.andP;  The written tutorial uses the development environment to demonstrateall the basic features of each tool.andP;  The interface is simple, intuitive, andeasy to learn and use.andM;The editor is quite good, supporting the basic editing commands as well as asimple keystroke macro facility and seamless integration with both thecompiler and debugger.andP;  You access advanced editor commands through Alt-keycombinations that have some mnemonic value.andP;  The display format is confusingat first; column one of the program being edited is displayed in column sixon the screen, leaving five blank spaces to the left of the code.andP;  Other thanthat (and some inconsistent behavior of the Enter key when I positioned thecursor at the end of the file), the editor was easy to learn and I quicklybecame comfortable with it.andM;You can write program changes to a temporary change file, but they're notmade permanent until you give the Update command in the project manager.andP;  Youcan make multiple edit/compile/debug cycles without affecting the permanentcopy of the source.andP;  Once the program is working, you can update the source.andM;Programs are compiled to pseudocode that's interpreted by the COBOL run-timesystem.andP;  The biggest disadvantage of this approach is the run-timeperformance penalty-the code is very slow compared to any of the native codecompilers.andP;  But compilation is noticeably faster and the resulting objectcode can be run on a wide range of platforms without recompiling.andM;To use the debugger without the RM/CO* environment, you must have a printedprogram listing nearby, and even then it's awkward and difficult.andP;  With theRM/CO* environment, source-level debugging is possible but still limited tothe commands available in the stand-alone debugger.andP;  However, I noticed quitea difference between entering line numbers and data addresses and pointing toa line or entering a data name.andP;  The documentation devotes only four pages tousing the debugger in source mode.andP;  All other information is located in theusers guide for the stand-alone version.andP;  No support is provided fordebugging assembly language subroutines.andM;The COBOL package also includes utilities for converting index and relativefiles from the v. 2.n systems to formats compatible with the COBOL-85 system.andO;I used these years ago to convert several megabytes of data when I upgradedfrom v. 2 to RM/COBOL-85.andP;  They worked flawlessly then, and I have no reasonto believe they've changed.andP;  Other utilities modify and reportcharacteristics of indexed files, modify and report on object program files,and recover damaged files.andP;  Each of these utilities worked as described inthe documentation.andM;Ryan McFarland's biggest selling points over the years have been the qualityof its products and the wide range of systems supported by the run time.andO;However, its development environment has always been command-line-orientedand the company provided very little development support.andP;  Ryan-McFarlandshould consider adding RM/CO* to the standard compiler package andimplementing the report-writer module if this compiler is to stay competitivewith other comparably priced systems.andM;Microsoft Corp. COBOL Optimizing Compiler V. 3.0andM;Microsoft COBOL v. 3.0 is a GSA-certified high implementation of ANSIX3.23-1985 with extensions.andP;  Extension elements include most of the commonlyused IBM OS/VS extensions, most of the language constructs of IBM VS COBOLII, and Micro Focus-specific extensions.andP;  The development system is identicalto the two-year-old Micro Focus compiler v. 1.andP;  1.andM;The operating guide is well organized and includes special sections onwriting compact and efficient code and converting Data General and RyanMcFarland COBOL code to Micro Focus syntax.andP;  Documentation for the ACCEPT andDISPLAY interactive subsystem is comprehensive but scattered throughout theoperating guide.andM;This subsystem provides a very powerful set of user-interface tools but isconfusing when initially described.andP;  You can configure it a number of ways,although the initial configuration for IBM PCs and compatibles is probablysufficient for most applications.andP;  The subsystem must be included in allprograms that use the extended ACCEPT and DISPLAY functions.andM;Documentation consists of three three-ring binders comprising a languagereference manual, operating guide, and information on the Microsoft Editorand utility programs provided with the package.andP;  A spiral-bound pocket guideserves as a quick reference to COBOL language features; command-line andenvironment options for the compiler, linker, debugger; and other programs.andO;These pocket guides are my favorite feature of Microsoft language products;they're much nicer and easier to work with than the pocket-sized booklet thatcomes with the Micro Focus compiler.andM;After flipping to the  Getting Started&quot; section in the operating guide, youput the set-up disk in drive A: and type SETUP.andP;  The setup program lets youselect the modules to be included: DOS and/or OS/2 compiler, utilities,demonstration programs, communications, DISPLAY and ACCEPT configurationutilities, con@ version programs, and so on.andP;  A checklist would helpdetermine exactly which modules you need for your installation.andP;  SETUP letsyou select default values from the many command-line options.andP;  I selected thedefault configuration that's basically ANSI 74/85 support without nestedprogram support.andP;  The program tells you what it will do before anydirectories are created or files copied and always leaves you a way to stopinstallation.andP;  The configuration I selected, including the Microsoft editor,took about 3MB of disk space.andP;  A full configuration with all options wouldtake over 4MB.andM;Although an editor and debugger are supplied, the package has no realenvironment for program development.andP;  The Microsoft Editor can start acompile and respond to error-message output, but only if the error messagesare in a specified format that the Microsoft COBOL compiler does not support.andO;Interestingly enough, the Micro Focus compiler reviewed has an EDITOR optionthat lets you specify the error-message format on the command line.andP;  Out ofcuriosity, I tried this option with the Microsoft compiler, but it wasn'timplemented.andM;My first attempt to compile a program from within the editor resulted in afrozen machine; I specified the command line incorrectly and the compiler wasasking for more input.andP;  The editor doesn't let you interact with thecompiler, so I had no way to abort compilation or have the editor regaincontrol.andP;  Ctrl-Alt-Del was my only way out of that one.andM;I found the Microsoft Editor only marginally functional.andP;  It's very powerfulbut learning more than the basic editing commands is difficult.andP;  And sinceyou can't use the compiler output to drive the editor, I had little reason toswitch from my favorite text editor.andP;  The documentation provides ampleinformation for advanced features such as adding C extensions, but verylittle instruction on how to use the editor's basic functions.andP;  Afterspending 10 minutes poring over the documentation, I couldn't find a way tosave the file and remain in the editor working on my file.andP;  Even the&quot;Comprehensive Listing of Editing Functions&quot; failed to mention Save File.andP;  Itwas annoying.andM;The compiler sports a bewildering set of over 125 command-line switches.andO;With all of the exclusions, cautions, interactions, and restrictions pointedout in the manual, I wonder if even the language developers (much less anyusers) understand how they all work.andP;  All switches may be specified on thecommand line: some in the source file using the $ indicator-area characterand some at the beginning of the source file before any program code.andP;  Thedocumentation does the best job possible explaining these restrictions, butit's confusing nonetheless.andM;The source-level debugger, Animator, is fun to work with and more thanadequate for debugging most COBOL programs.andP;  It can't debug subprogramswritten in other languages - a shortcoming that may prove difficult for thosedeveloping in multiple languages.andP;  However, non-COBOL subprograms should bevery rare considering the plethora of low-level functions provided in theCOBOL libraries.andP;  The data query menu is comprehensive, allowing display inboth ASCII and hexadecimal.andP;  Support for COBOL data structures is complete,including the ability to display records and table entries with next andprevious options.andP;  All in all, the debugger is the most attractive feature ofthis development system.andM;Called programs and external libraries may be either hard or soft linked.andO;Hard linking involves linking with the run-time library statically, as inmost DOS programming languages.andP;  Soft linking is done through the use of adynamic system that loads and executes separately created executable files.andM;Both linking methods have advantages and disadvantages.andP;  Called programs thatare statically linked are not physically removed from memory when a CANCELdirective is issued, and soft-linked programs contain all COBOL runtime codeeven though it is contained in the calling program as well.andP;  Under thissystem, the best way to save memory is through segmentation, which is fullysupported and well documented.andM;Microsoft utilities in the package include LINK, the segmented executablelinker v. 5.02.05, the LIB librarian, and Microsoft MAKE.andP;  Linking programswith the /EXEPACK option created programs that didn't execute.andM;Microsoft COBOL v. 3.0 is a comprehensive and well-documented developmentsystem, lacking only the integration of a full development system.andP;  Thecompiler and debugger are well designed and documented, but this is the workof Micro Focus.andP;  The Microsoft-supplied products LINK and utilities) arenoticeably user-unfriendly and documentation-poor.andP;  You have to applaudMicrosoft for switching to Micro Focus rather than continuing with their oldv. 2.0 COBOL, but the product needs to be upgraded to stay competitive withcurrent development systems.andM;Micro Focus inc. Micro Focus COBOL/2 v. 2.4.17 Micro Focus Toolset v. 2.4.17andM;The new Micro Focus compiler is a descendant of the two-year-old compilersupplied with the Microsoft development system.andP;  Operation is much the same,and the compiler alone sells for the same price as Microsoft's offering.andP;  ButToolset adds a complete development system with a COBOL editor, enhanceddebugging facilities, a windowing system called PANELS, and a comprehensiverun-time support system, among other tools.andM;The Micro Focus package was delivered in a single bookcase-style boxcontaining 11 softcover manuals, a pocket-sized reference book, and two boxesof distribution disks.andP;  The package I received contained the compiler,Toolset, and Workbench-a more comprehensive development environment than evenToolset presents.andP;  Workbench itself costs $1,800 and requires a minimum of1.5MB of free RAM and a minimum of 9MB hard disk space.andP;  My machine is alowly AT-compatible with only 640K of RAM, so I didn't even attempt toinstall Workbench.andM;The compiler documentation is in much the same format as in previousversions, with the exception of the new binding format and SETUP installationprogram, which has been rewritten and now offers a more screen-orientedinterface.andP;  As with the Microsoft package, the installation guide in theusers manual would benefit from a section discussing necessary modules.andM;The compiler and debugger are essentially the same as older versions but withmore compiler command-line switches (160 compared with the older version's125).andP;  They also have some added functions to support the integration withToolset and Workbench and to correct some errors in previous versions.andP;  Autility called SCREENS is a major addition to the basic compiler package.andP;  Itlets you rapidly specify screen layouts and generate COBOL code forscreen-handling functions.andP;  SCREENS also supports loading and saving files inFORMS and FORMS-2 formats used by the Toolset FORMS utility.andM;SCREENS's documentation includes a tutorial that leads you through creating arudimentary screen and compiling and testing a program that uses thegenerated code.andP;  This utility is not needed if FORMS is available.andM;Most of the Microsoft utilities, including the Microsoft Editor, were leftout of this package; LINK and LIB are the only remaining Microsoft products.andO;The version of LINK (5.05) provided with this package does not suffer fromthe /EXEPACK bug I discovered in the older version.andM;Toolset documentation is provided in three of the 1 1 books supplied with thesystem.andP;  Development and Execution Tools provides detailed information oneach of the Toolset programs.andP;  This book should serve as a template for othersoftware documentation.andP;  Each tool has its own section, beginning with anintroduction and overview and continuing with a simple tutorial that workswith an example program provided with the system.andP;  The reference guide foreach tool follows the tutorial.andM;PC Programmer's Guide is a global reference to the entire development system.andO;As well as providing answers to many commonly asked questions, it includesreferences to the more comprehensive discussions of each topic contained inthe other Micro Focus manuals.andM;The third book, Co-Writer, describes two programs that let users access datafiles without having to understand programming.andP;  I could find no mention ofthis utility in any of the other documentation and could not locate therelease notes alluded to in the manual.andP;  The procedure for installing Toolsetis essentially the same as for the compiler: put the SETUP disk in thediskette drive, type SETUP, and follow the bouncing ball.andM;The COBOL editor has all the basic functions of a programming editor, anapparently inexhaustible undo buffer, a handy margins command, a usable helpsystem, and a very good tutorial section consisting of a disk file and achapter in the Toolset manual.andP;  Additional features let you edit filesidentified by statements such as CALL, COPY, and INCLUDE, a calculator, andfull support for syntax checking and animating COBOL programs.andP;  You can edit,compile, and debug without leaving the editor.andM;The FORMS facility provided within the editor lets you define and generatecode for interactive screens without leaving the editor.andP;  This facilitycreates an entire COBOL program based on a form you design.andP;  The generatedprogram lets you key data into the form and store it in an indexed sequentialfile.andP;  This index program is a rudimentary database designed around your formand lets you add, change, and search for records.andP;  This should greatly reducethe amount of time spent designing and testing simple database programs.andP;  Thedocumentation contains a very nice tutorial that leads you through creationand execution of a simple telephone directory form.andM;PANELS is a callable module that gives windowing and pull-down and pop-upmenus to your COBOL programs.andP;  Multiple overlapping windows, separate orsynchronized text updating, and text scrolling are all supported.andP;  Withsufficient memory, the system can support up to 65,534 panels, with 254visible at one time.andP;  Two sample COBOL programs and a short tutorial at thebeginning of the documentation give you an impressive view of the PANELSsubsystem's power.andP;  The last chapter of the PANELS manual introduces atutorial program, PANTUTOR .CBL, and explains its function through the use ofthe Animator debugger.andP;  The sample programs and documentation give you ampleinformation to add windowing to an application.andM;The run-time environment provides an alternate method to the DOS linkerapproach of linking and using run-time support libraries.andP;  Logically, thisrun-time system works much like Ryan McFarland's except Micro Focus'sexecutes native 8Ox86 code that is soft-linked instead of compiledpseudocode.andP;  A Build utility lets you create freestanding applications thatuse the run-time system.andP;  The primary attraction of this subsystem is itsability to execute programs larger than available memory.andP;  This is handled bythe run-time memory manager.andP;  Programs can be executed by using the RUNcommand followed by the program name or through the use of the run-timeshell, which adds the capability of executing COBOL.INT (intermediate code)or .GNT  generated native code) files, as well as standard DOS .BAT, .COM, or.EXE files.andM;XILERATOR is an enhanced Animator program that provides for source-leveldebugging of the final executable image created by the COBOL/2 compiler (.GNTcode).andP;  XILERATOR can also debug assembly language code or other .EXE files.andO;However, the program is memory-intensive and requires 220K of free memory ontop of whatever is used by the application being examined.andP;  As with the otherprograms provided in Toolset, a sample program and tutorial section of theusers guide show XILERATOR's capabilities.andM;With Toolset, this development system was the most expensive of the productsreviewed.andP;  But even without Toolset, it's a better development system thanany I've worked with.andP;  The documentation, editor, and FORMS and PANELS toolsmake developing interactive programs fun.andP;  The only feature lacking is aproject-management facility like that provided by RM/CO*.andP;  The environment isobviously designed for use on high-powered machines with multiple megabytesof memory, but it works well even on a minimum-configuration AT compatible.andM;ACUCOBOL inc. ACUCOBOL  1.41andM;ACUCOBOL is an ANSI X3.23-1985 COBOL level-1 (intermediate) compiler withextensions and level-2 (high) support of the nucleus, sequential, relative,and indexed 1/0 modules.andP;  None of the optional modules (report writer,communication, debug, and segmentation) is supported, with the exception ofsyntax-only support of the segmentation module.andP;  Extensions include ACCEPTand DISPLAY with screen control, a CHAIN statement, and most of the commonextensions of other COBOL compilers.andM;The compiler is shipped on two diskettes.andP;  The documentation is a singlethree-ring binder containing a users guide and language reference manual.andP;  Noindex is provided, although the table of contents is comprehensive.andP;  Theusers guide has separate sections for compiler and run time, debugger, andterminal manager.andP;  The information is no more than adequate.andP;  As with theVisual COBOL package, documentation for all versions (DOS, UNIX, and VAX/VMS)of the compiler is included in a single manual.andP;  The language referencemanual is comparable to those of the other packages reviewed, but discussionof specific language features isn't as comprehensive as inMicro Focus or RyanMcFarland.andP;  Appendices give installation instructions, information oninterfacing with C and assembly language subroutines, a description oflibrary routines, and a small section on converting RM/COBOL applications.andM;For installation, all you have to do is copy the contents of the twodiskettes to your hard disk.andP;  A small sample program on the disk andinstructions for compiling and running it test the installation.andP;  Othersample programs illustrate linking of assembly language subroutines and someof the screen-handling and windowing features.andM;Besides the compiler and runtime with source debugger, a single utilityprogram creates, rebuilds, and examines ACUCOBOL file structures.andP;  Unlike theother systems reviewed, no editor or other development support programs areprovided, although the compiler can be run in &quot;librarian&quot; mode to create andmanage object file libraries.andM;The compiler interface is command-line-oriented with UNIX-like command-lineoptions.andP;  In addition to the normal specification of object and listingfeatures and filenames, compatibility, source format, ANSI conformance,debugging, and optimization can be selected on the command line.andP;  It'sannoying that the default object code output is to a file called CBL.OUTrather than a file with the same base name as the source.andP;  In addition,source files must be fully specified-a standard extension is not assumed,which contrasts most other language compilers.andP;  Compilation produces anintermediate object code interpreted by the run-time system.andP;  This providessource- and object-code compatibility across a wide variety of machines andoperating systems but imposes a penalty in terms of runtime speed.andP;  As withthe compiler, the run time does not assume a standard extension for objectmodules so filenames must be fully specified.andM;The run-time source debugger appears to be a symbolic debugger with a  viewsource&quot; option tacked on.andP;  Rudimentary debugging (with single-step, trace,breakpoints, watch, and data display) is supported with no fancy tricks.andP;  Theonline help requires the file CBLHELP to be located in the \ETC directory onthe current disk.andP;  This is pointed out in the compiler installationinstructions but the \ETC directory appears to be the only part of the systemthat requires it.andP;  The help file should be accessible through the PATH orother environment variable.andP;  Using the debugger is simple; I was comfortablewith it in no time.andM;In addition to the Ryan McFarland extensions to the ACCEPT and DISPLAY verbs,ACUCOBOL supports DISPLAY WINDOW, DISPLAY SCREEN, DISPLAY LINE, and DISPLAY BOX verbs you can use to create a variety of advanced screen effects.andP;  You canpop windows up over other windows and create vertical and horizontal linesand boxes with or without titles.andP;  Screen size can be changed from 80 to 132columns, and the ACCEPT FROM SCREEN statement can read all or part of thescreen for future reference.andP;  The resulting effects are quite impressive.andM;ACUCOBOL is a lean and mean compiler with no bells or whistles.andP;  Thedocumentation could stand some polishing, although it's well organized andcomplete.andP;  But the compiler itself is extremely fast much faster than any ofthe others - and everything seems to work as advertised.andP;  The windowingextensions to the ACCEPT and DISPLAY verbs are an added draw, but to bereally useful they should be supported by a screen-development system similarto that provided by Micro Focus or mbp.andM;mbp Software and Systems inc. mbp Visual COBOL  2.1 mbp COBOL Editor v. 2.0andM;mbp Visual COBOL is an ANSI X3.23-1985 level-1 (intermediate) compiler withlevel-2 (high) extensions to the indexed I/O and interprogram communicationmodules.andP;  It also has implementation-specific extensions-particularly in theACCEPT and DISPLAY verbs.andM;The compiler package comes on seven 51/4-inch diskettes along with twothree-ring binders of documentation (users guide and language reference), anda thin, staple-bound syntax summary.andP;  The version I received for review alsocontained several pages of photocopied release notes that are also availablein a file on one of the distribution disks.andP;  The editor comes with a separatepackage containing a single diskette and a staple-bound users guide.andP;  Thecompiler users guide and language reference manual look like paperback booksthat were cut and hole-punched.andP;  The pages stick together at the formerlybound edge and the holes are strategically located in the middle of printedparagraphs.andM;This version of Visual COBOL includes the Visual Assistant (a menu-oriented,program-development environment), an interactive symbolic debugger, ascreen-management system that allows relatively painless design ofinteractive screens, and a sort utility that can sort any of the supportedCOBOL file types.andM;The users guide contains all the information you need to use the facilitiesof the system, but it lacks any tutorial information.andP;  For tutorial examples,the user is told to see the example programs provided with the system, but nohand-holding is done.andP;  Information for both MS-DOS and UNIX implementationsis sprinkled throughout the manual, making it tough to dig generalinformation out from the implementation-specific details.andM;The language reference manual's format is much the same as most other COBOLreference materials, with separate sections for each COBOL division andadditional sections on interprogram communications and sort/merge.andP;  Thisinformation appears to completely specify the language subset recognized bythe compiler.andP;  Extension, obsolete, and ANSI level-2 elements of the languageare shaded differently from the level-1 elements to point out possibleincompatibilities with other systems.andM;Sample programs demonstrate most of the advanced functions of the developmentsystem.andP;  The readme file contains the documentation for these files.andO;Unfortunately, the printed documentation makes no reference to either theexample programs or the readme file.andP;  The on-disk documentation is simply alisting of filenames with short descriptions of each.andP;  Some of the sampleprograms contain compile and link instructions as embedded comments-most donot.andM;The installation program lets you select the destination drive and path andinstall the C interface.andP;  The full package, including C interface and COBOLeditor, took slightly over 2.5M]3 on my disk.andM;Visual Assistant, the integrated environment, is likable but suffers incomparison with some of the others reviewed.andP;  The most severe problem is analmost complete lack of documentation (two pages in the release notes).andP;  Allenvironment functions are accessible through Visual Assistant, and theinitial user interface is self-explanatory.andP;  But the interface to each toolis cumbersome and not entirely intuitive at first glance.andM;One nice feature is that you can specify an editor other than the mbp COBOLEditor, and Visual Assistant will access it.andP;  The program emits a beepwhenever an invalid key is pressed.andP;  I found no way to turn this off, and theother support programs (editor, debugger, mask editor) also suffer from theannoying feature.andM;You can access the editor from both the command line and Visual Assistant.andO;Basic cursor-movement and insert/delete functions work as expected, but someadvanced cursor-movement functions are not supported (moving the cursor aword at a time rather than character by character, for instance).andP;  A menu baraccessed by pressing the Esc key gets you most editor functions.andP;  Functionkeys give you a shortcut to executing some of the most commonly usedfunctions such as cut-and-paste and file positioning, and a rudimentarykeyboard macro facility lets you assign multiple keystrokes to Alt-keycombinations.andP;  On-line help is provided for each function and subfunctionavailable on the menu bar.andP;  To correct compiler errors, edit the offendingfile and open a second window to display the compiler error listing.andM;The compiler is command-line-oriented with a command-line format much thesame as the Microsoft and Micro Focus compilers.andP;  Within the VisualAssistant, you can specify compiler filenames and command-line options.andO;Compiler options are provided for specifying source listing format (errorsonly, map file, cross reference, object listing), debugger and ANSI support,and the behavior of certain data types, and ACCEPT and DISPLAY.andO;Documentation for the compiler options is complete and informative.andM;Program linking assumes that you have a copy of Microsoft LINK accessiblethrough the DOS PATH environment variable.andP;  Both static and dynamic linkingare supported, the latter through the use of a startup file that loads therun-time library at program execution.andP;  Using dynamically linked programs isadvantageous in that only one copy of the run-time library is contained ondisk or in memory.andP;  DOS batch files greatly simplify linking, and the SHRINKprogram can greatly reduce the size of executable files.andP;  This works much thesame as the Microsoft  EXEPACK utility and the /EXEPACK option of theMicrosoft linker.andM;The interactive symbolic debugger is actually a source-level debugger withall the normal debugger functions (display data, single-stepping,breakpoints, and trace).andP;  No on-line help is available.andP;  One nice feature isthe Find def command, which lets you type in a data or procedure nameposition.andP;  Other debuggers let you position to procedure names, butdisplaying data definitions is more difficult.andP;  Data can be examined andmodified in both ASCII and hexadecimal formats.andP;  This debugger is quitepossibly the most attractive element of the Visual COBOL package.andM;The mbp package is a usable system that supports a generous subset of theANSI COBOL 85 standard.andP;  It lacks the some of the polish of the other systems(specifically Micro Focus and Ryan McFarland), especially in thedocumentation.andP;  The Visual Assistant is functional, allowing completedevelopment and testing from within the environment.andP;  Documentation should becleaned up, and a tutorial section for each of the separate tools would be awelcome addition.andM;All reasonable choicesandM;Ranging in price from $900 to $1,800, these products cover a variety ofcapabilities.andP;  Except for mbp's Visual COBOL, the base price of all thedevelopment systems is $900, but the systems as reviewed give a bettermeasure of what is available from the various vendors.andM;Micro Focus COBOL/2 with Toolset is by far the most complete developmentsystem reviewed.andP;  Even without Toolset, the Micro Focus compiler is animpressive collection of development tools.andP;  Microsoft can be expected tooffer the same system in the near future.andP;  Micro Focus is also the onlyvendor that implements the entire COBOL standard, including optional modules.andM;Ryan McFarland's integrated development environment, RM/CO*, was the easiestenvironment to master.andP;  Ryan McFarland also sports the oldest of thedevelopment systems - with implementations going as far back as 1975.andM;All the compilers offer source-code compatibility with other systems.andP;  Allbut one, mbp Visual COBOL, offer some degree of RM/COBOL compatibility.andM;ACUCOBOL and RM/COBOL also offer object-code compatibility across platforms,with RM supporting seven different industry-standard operating systemsincluding MS-DOS, OS/2, UNIX, UNIX workalikes, and an impressive array ofspecific systems including Apple Macintosh, Data General, Hewlett-Packard,and Prime.andM;Each compiler presents a complete development environment you can use tocreate real COBOL applications for MS-DOS or other systems.andM;Jim Mischel is a former financial systems programmer and data processingconsultant.andP;
