A general strike shut down some stores, factories and masstransit, and residents of the southern republic donned blackribbons in a sign of mourning and protest, residents said.   Protests went on despite official calls for calm, a ban onpublic gatherings, the imposition of a curfew and patrols bysoldiers and tanks in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi.   The ruling Politburo sent Foreign Minister Eduard A.Shevardnadze, a Georgian who once headed the Communist Party leaderin the republic, and party personnel chief Georgy P. Razumvosky toTbilisi to oversee efforts to restore calm, Foreign Ministryspokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said.   About 1,000 people ignored the ban on public gatherings and metat Tbilisi State University at midday to ``to inform each otherabout what was going on and decide what to do next,'' ZurabZhankarashvili, a member of the Helsinki Watch group, said bytelephone.   ``The military stood there with their tanks and frightened thepeople off. They shot in the air,'' said Zhankarashvili, who was atthe gathering.   He said soldiers beat two university students.   Sergei Dandurov, an activist who also attended the meeting,confirmed that troops fired into the air and said the gatheringlasted about 30 minutes.   On Sunday, club-swinging troops charged a crowd of about 10,000people that jammed Lenin Square and protesters used flagpoles,stones and other objects to defend themselves, witnesses said.   Official reports said 16 were killed and more than 100 injuredSunday. Nurse Nana Byelovami of the Central Republic Hospital todayreported two more deaths: A 23-year-old pregnant woman who wasbeaten and a 50-year-old woman who inhaled tear gas.   Gerasimov said today 16 civilians _ 10 women and six men _ werekilled, and that all had been trampled. Tuesday was declared anofficial day of mourning, he said.   However, Zhankarashvili said 50 people were killed on Sunday and560 injured. His report could not be confirmed independently.   Tension has been building in Georgia since Tuesday, whenthousands of hunger strikers and protesters began pressing demandsfor independence. Georgian nationalists contend theRussian-dominated Kremlin has encroached on their culture,language, politics and economy.   Others rallied to protest calls by some residents of a region inGeorgia, Abkhazia, to secede from the republic because of allegeddiscrimination by Georgians against ethnic Abkhazians.   Taking advantage of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy ofopenness, several of the country's more than 100 ethnic groups areventing pent-up complaints of discrimination and officialinsensitivity to local needs.   In an attempt to prevent future unrest, the central governmenton Saturday issued a decree making insulting or discrediting thegovernment punishable by up to three years and fines.   The official Tass news agency said the decree also prohibitsappeals to kindling ethnic tensions and racial hostility andappeals to commit treason.   Georgia is the third southern Soviet republic where authoritieshave in the past year used troops to quell ethnic disturbances. InNovember, troops and tanks were sent to Armenia and Azerbaijan,where more than 90 people had died in ethnic violence.   Independence activists called a general strike today to protestSunday's killings, but it was unclear if there was full compliancein Tbilisi, a city of 1.2 million people about 1,100 milessoutheast of Moscow.   ``No one is going to work,'' said Nokri Dzhangarashvili, astudent.   ``Everyone but doctors and breadmakers are on strike,'' said avisitor at the central hospital who refused to give his name.``There is no transport. All stores are closed except food stores.Factories are closed.''   Gerasimov said most businesses were working but that some openedlate because young people disrupted public transport and delayedpeople going to work. He confirmed that colleges were closedbecause of the strike.   Police arrested at least six prominent Georgian activists duringthe weekend and had a list of 30 others they were seeking, saidNanuli Gogua, whose daughter Irina Sarishvili was among those takeninto custody by the KGB.   The Foreign Ministry said that Tbilisi was closed to foreigncorrespondents as well as any Soviets reporting for Western newsorganizations.   Authorities imposed an 11 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew on Sunday after theviolence.   Tass said the soldiers followed orders not to use their weaponsSunday but that ``extremists'' resisted with rocks, sticks andpieces of metal and that ``their actions caused a crush in thecrowd and as a result, 16 people died.''   Tass said the 100 people injured included 75 soldiers andpolicemen.</TEXT></DOC>
