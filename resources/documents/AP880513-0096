(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man on a 100-minute flight from Seattle toReno has apparently become the first person charged with violatinga 3-week-old federal ban on smoking on domestic airline flights oftwo hours or less.   Darryl Seigel, 38, is facing maximum fines totaling $6,000 fortaking a few puffs on a cigarette he admits he smoked while in theplane's lavatory Thursday.   Seigel claims he did not purposely break the law but lit upabsent-mindedly when he was in the plane lavatory. ``It was ahonest mistake,'' he said.   Seigel was detained by Reno Cannon International Airportsecurity for two hours Thursday at the request of the USAir flightcrew, said airport spokesman Rich Peacock.   He is accused of smoking on a flight where it is banned, smokingin the lavatory and tampering with the lavatory smoke detector. TheFederal Aviation Administration could fine him $2,000 for eachalleged violation, Peacock said.   About 20 minutes into the plane ride, a flight attendant spottedsmoke after Seigel left the lavoratory, asked him if he knew aboutthe federal law against smoking on certain flights, then informedhim he would be arrested when they landed, according to Peacock.   The flight attendant had explained the new law to passengersbefore the plane took off, he added.   The federal smoking ban on short flights went into effect April23.   Ronald Steele, operations inspector for the federal FlightStandards District Office in Reno, said he believes Seigel is thefirst person to be charged with violating that law.</TEXT></DOC>
