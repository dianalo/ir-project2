Shultz today rejected a move in the United Nations that hereverse himself and grant PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat a visa to speakto the General Assembly.   He said that his decision barring Arafat was based on U.S. lawand that the controversy ``shows how easy it is for people to forgetthe devastation which terrorism can wreak on a country.''   Shultz repeated his assertions that Arafat was an ``accessory''to acts of terrorism by the Palestine Liberation Organizationagainst Americans and Israelis. At the same time, Shultz rejected aBritish reporter's suggestion the ``interational row'' raised by thedecision could be a ``blot'' on his last days as Secretary of State.   ``I operated within the framework of a law here.'' Shultzreplied. ``If the thing I am remembered for is most of all a strongand a great resolve to resist and combat terrorism, I won't feelthat's a blot on my record. I'll feel that is a proudaccomplishment.''   The General Assembly's legal committee voted 121-2 Tuesday nightto ask the State Department to grant Arafat a U.S. visa. Only theUnited States and Israel were opposed.   That was an indication of how lopsided the vote was likely to betoday when the 159-member General Assembly takes up anArab-sponsored resolution deploring Shultz's decision.   Asked if he would reverse himself, Shultz replied: ``No.''   The subject dominated an interview he gave over the U.S.Information Agency's ``Worldnet'' program to reporters in WesternEurope. They asked more questions about Arafat's visa than thesuggested topic, the meeting Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev willhave in New York next Wednesday with President Reagan andPresident-elect George Bush.   While defending the decision, Shultz stressed that PalestinianArabs had a central role to play in Mideast peace efforts. ``We wantto see a good dialogue with the Palestinians,'' Shultz said.   He recalled his efforts to meet with Palestinians in Jerusalemduring trips to the region this year. All those invited, followingPLO instructions, did not show up.   Shultz said the Palestine National Council, the legislative armof the PLO, had taken some ``significant'' steps during its recentmeeting in Algiers. But, he said, the PLO should go further andrecognize Israel's right to exist.   ``If they can do it implicitly, why can't they do itexplicitly?'' Shultz asked.</TEXT></DOC>
