The test program included performinga thermodynamic study of the proposed process, design and preparationof the actual test program, performance of that test, analyzing the resultsof the test, and documenting the results of the program in this report.The test was performed for the Westinghouse Materials Company of Ohio(WMCO) by the Westinghouse Environmental Technology Division (now theEnvironmental Services Division). All testing was completed at the PlasmaCenter located at the Westinghouse Waltz Mill Site, Madison, Pennsylvania.The primary objective of this proof-of-principle experiment was to demonstratethat raffinate solutions containing nitric acid and various metal nitrates,when treated in a plasma torch reactor, would decompose the nitratesto oxides and that the product solid metal oxides could be separatedfrom the gaseous product nitrogen oxides. 15 figs., 10 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
