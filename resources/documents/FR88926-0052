Use of herbicides will also be considered in this environmentalimpact statement. Cooperation with counties, other agencies, and privatelandowners is a requirement of the Forest Plan and will be included inthe EIS.An environmental analysis has been completed for control of noxious andother undesirable weeds on the forest. Based on public involvement andidentified issues it was decided that an environmental impact statementshould be completed. The environmental analysis including the public involvementand information will be used to complete the environmental impact statement.A range of alternatives for management of noxious and other undersirableweeds will be considered. One of these will be a no action alternative.Others that will be considered will include cultural treatment techniquessuch as mechanical and handpulling, biological, chemical (herbicide) andintegrated pest management methods. The agency invites written commentsand suggestions on the scope of the analysis and opportunities for managementof weeds on the Forest. The agency also gives notice of the full environmentalanalysis and decision making process that will occur on the proposal sothat interested and affected parties are aware of how they may participateand contribute to the final decision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments concerning the scope of the analysis must be receivedby November 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Send written comments to William E.

It has been determined through surveys conducted in 1987 that approximately23,000 acres are infested with noxious weeds. These infestations includedleafy spurge, rush skeletonweed, Scotch thistle, Dalmatian toadflax, spottedknapweed, Russian knapweed, diffuse knapweed, tansy ragwort, and Canadathistle.The Forest Service is considering a 5 year program to treat about 1,600acres to contain the infestations and to prevent new invaders from becomingestablished. This program will be accomplished in cooperation with the5 northern Idaho counties, Benewah, Bonner, Boundary, Kootenai and Shoshoneand the State of Idaho. These counties manage about 1,800 acres of ForestService land within county road rights-of-way. They propose a 5 year programto treat 217 acres to contain infestations.A scoping process was utilized for an environmental assessment. Initialscoping began November 30, 1987, with letters being sent to interestedindividuals, organizations and other agencies. Public notice in local paperswas made November 30, 1987 and January 12, 1988. Several letters respondingto the initial notices and many news articles have appeared in local paperspertaining to management of weeds on the Idaho Panhandle National Forestssince publishing the first notice. This information will be used to developthe environmental impact statement. Additional scoping will be accomplishedto supplement and update existing information. Federal, State, and localagencies, farmers and other individuals or organizations who have expressedan interest or may be interested in or affected by the decision will beinvited to participate in the scoping process. This process will include:1. Identification of issues in addition to those identified in accomplishingthe environmetnal analysis.2. Identification of additional issues to be analyzed in depth.3. Elimination of insiginficant issues or those which have been coveredby a previous environmental review.The analysis is expected to take about 1 month. The draft environmentalimpact statement (DEIS) is expected to be filed with the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) and available for public review in December, 1988.At that time the EPA will publish a notice of availability of the DEISin the<T4> Federal Register</T4>. The comment period on the DEIS will be 45 daysfrom the date the EPA's notice of availability appears in the<T4> Federal Register</T4>. It is very important that those interestedin the management of noxious and other undesirable weeds on the Idaho PanhandleNational Forest participate at that time. To be most helpful, commentson the DEIS should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacyof the statement or the merits of the alternatives discussed (40 CFR 1503.3).In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers ofdraft EIS's must structure their participation in the environmental reviewof the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewers'position and contentions (<T3>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, </T3>435 U.S. 519, 553(1978), and that environmental objections that could have been raised atthe draft stage may be waived if not raised until after completion of thefinal environmental impact statement (<T3>Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. v. Harris, </T3>490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D.Wis. 1980). The reason for this is to ensure that substantive commentsand objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time whenit can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final EIS.After the comment period ends on the DEIS, the comments will be analyzedand considered by the Forest Service in preparing the final environmentalimpact statement (FEIS). The FEIS is scheduled to be completed by February,1989. In the FEIS the Forest Service is required to respond to the commentsreceived (40 CFR 1503.4). The responsible official will consider the commentsand responses, environmental consequences discussed in the FEIS, and policiesin making a decision regarding this proposal. The responsible officialwill document the decision and reasons for the decision in the Record ofDecision.That decision will be subject to review under applicable Forest Serviceregulations.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: September 19, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William E.
