This rate issimilar to that derived from the Eastport, Maine, tide gauge, assuminga 1.0-1.5 mm/yr eustatic rise in sea level. In addition, a subsidencerate of 1-2 mm/yr is roughly consistent with longer term (a few thousandyears) rates derived from glacial-marine deltas and from dated basalpeats along the Maine coast.</TEXT></DOC>
