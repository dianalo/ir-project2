Techniquesused in the individual subsystems depend on the characteristics of theplant and the state to be diagnosed. This paper gives a review of thefault diagnosis systems for continuous process in a steady state, continuousprocess with fluctuating loads and the batch process. Abnormality diagnosisof continuous process at the stationary condition is the easiest of thethree cases. Signed diagraph method is practically usable according tothe result of commercialization test with a pilot plant. For the citygas or power generation plant wherein fluctuating loads occur frequently,statistical state estimation and signed diagraph methods are effective.For the batch process, pattern recognition method is effective. However,the last two have numerous points to improve before they are made practical.(13 figs, 6 tabs, 21 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
