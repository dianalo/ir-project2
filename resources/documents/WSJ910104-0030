The Wayne, N.J., maker of specialty chemicals and buildingmaterials, which was taken private in 1989 in amanagement-led buy-out, was seeking to offer shares of itswholly owned G-I Holdings Inc. for the debt. The debentureswere issued as part of the cash-and-debt buyout.</LP><TEXT>   The offer failed because a majority of the debt holdersdid not submit their shares by the Wednesday deadline, GAFsaid. It said it will return those debentures that weretendered, and may spend up to $60 million to purchase some ofthe debentures in the open market or in private transactions.Irwin Engelman, GAF's chief financial officer, saidagreements with bank lenders restrict it from making a largercash buy-back of the subordinate debt.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          GAF Corp.'s recently expired exchange offer for $236million of subordinated debentures was for $250 cash and $700in new debentures for each $1,000 of debentures tendered.Friday's edition incorrectly stated the terms of the offer.
