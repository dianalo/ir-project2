Many devicesthat employ magnetic fields have heretofore been encumbered by massivesolenoids with their equally bulky power supplies. Thus, there has beenincreasing interest in the application of permanent magnet structuresfor such uses as electron-beam focusing and biasing fields. Demand forcompact, strong, static magnetic field sources that require no electricpower supplies has created needs for permanent magnet structures of unusualform. A number of configurations have been designed and developed forelectron-beam guidance in millimeter-wave microwave tubes of varioustypes; for dc biasing fields in millimeter-wave filters, circulators,isolators, striplines; for field sources in NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance)imagers; and so on. Especially promising for such purposes is the configurationbased upon the hollow cylindrical flux source (HCFS) principle describedby K. Halbach . A HCFS, sometimes called a magic ring, is a cylindricalpermanent magnet shell that produces an internal magnetic field moreor less constant in magnitude. The field is perpendicular to the axisof the cylinder and, furthermore, the field strength can be greater thanthe remanence of the magnetic material from which the ring is made.</TEXT></DOC>
