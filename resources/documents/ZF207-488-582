 But what if you want to solve simultaneousequations, evaluate a modified Bessel function, take the transpose of amatrix or factor a polynomial?andP;  You'll need an equation solver.andM;Three programs that can help evaluate sets of mathematical expressions haverecently been introduced or updated.andP;  TK Solver Plus is an update of an earlyMac program; MathCAD, already popular on IBM PCs, is new for the Mac; andPowerMath II is the commercial offspring of university projects in artificialintelligence.andM;Defining the problem.andP;  Each of these equation solvers takes a differentapproach to how math problems should be stated.andP;  TK Solver is the most rigid,and MathCAD is the most free-form.andM;TK Solver provides many kinds of sheets for information entry.andP;  Each sheethas rows and columns like a spreadsheet, but the columns are already labeledfor particular purposes.andM;Rule sheets hold equations, variable sheets list the names and values of alldefined variables, and function sheets store definitions for user-definedfunctions.andP;  Plot sheets retain information about the data to be graphed, unitsheets hold conversion factors between various units of measurement, and listsheets contain listings of values for multivalued parameters.andM;Only when TK Solver has required information in proper places are resultspossible and predictable.andP;  Generally, results show up in the output column ofthe variable sheet, although results can also appear in list sheets and asgraphs.andM;MathCAD defines only one kind of document for all of its functions.andP;  MathCADdocuments are similar to those used by word processors, except they performcalculations.andM;Click anywhere and begin typing an equation into a blank MathCAD document.andO;The letters, numbers and symbols you enter will be interpreted as elements inmathematical equations.andP;  Enter matrices, vectors, integrals, summations andinequalities just as you would see them published in a book.andP;  Whenever anequals sign appears, MathCAD re-examines the document, performs all necessarycalculations and updates the results.andM;Only a few rules govern the way MathCAD interprets what you type.andP;  MathCADscans for equations left to right, then top to bottom.andP;  If you define avariable in one place then redefine it later, its value will change for allequations after the second definition.andP;  In case that's not what you want,there is a special sign for global definitions.andM;You can place explanatory text anywhere by creating a text block.andP;  You canalso place a graph or 3-D surface plot anywhere in the document, define itsaxes and watch it automatically update as required.andM;PowerMath II is a sort of hybrid of these two approaches.andP;  Equations to besolved go into problem slates; answers appear in solution slates.andP;  But eachof these slates consists of free-form text that doesn't have to be formattedin columns.andP;  Special slates are provided for importing plain text lists ofnumbers and for user-defined function definitions.andM;Strengths and weaknesses.andP;  PowerMath II excels at symbolic manipulation ofpolynomials.andP;  For instance, if you choose the Show Work option, PowerMath IIwill display manipulations like collecting terms, factoring and substituting.andO;It will even find derivatives of simple algebraic expressions.andP;  The otherpackages provide final numerical answers only.andM;This reliance on polynomials can be   a drawback, however.andP;  SinceandM;no general-  purpose numericalandM;routines are included, some problems cannot be solved.andP;  Unknowns cannot beexpressed as arguments of functions in PowerMath II, and differentialequations cannot be solved.andM;MathCAD is expert at handling complex numbers and performing vectorcalculations on them.andP;  In contrast, both PowerMath II and TK Solver requiresome programming (or at least the explicit use of built-in functions) tohandle complex math.andP;  MathCAD also has fast Fourier transform operationsbuilt in.andM;Another unique feature of MathCAD is its native mathematical notation.andO;PowerMath II and TK Solver expect all statements to be typed in a line, usingonly letters and numbers with no superscripts or subscripts.andP;  MathCAD allowsthe use of integral and summation signs, draws boxes around matrices, andgenerally accepts and displays problems without requiring translation betweenthe languages of mathematics and computer programming.andM;Version 2.0 of MathCAD suffers from serious problems with screen update thatdetract somewhat from the benefits of using native math notation.andP;  During thecourse of entering many elements in a document, items may overlap.andP;  Errormessages and an in-progress indicator appear and disappear sporadically.andM;Instead of handling screen updating automatically, MathCAD simply pops thingsonto the screen.andP;  To make sense of what you see, you'll often find yourselftyping the command to refresh the screen.andM;MathCAD also contains bugs in memory management.andP;  We experienced repeatedbombs when allotting the program more than 1 Mbyte of RAM in MultiFinder andwhen attempting some problems that were not particularly memory-intensive.andM;TK Solver is adroit at handling units of measurement.andP;  A list of common unitconversions can be imported, and user-defined units can be entered.andP;  Fromthen on, inputs and outputs can be expressed in any desired unit andconversions will occur automatically.andP;  This capability is particularly usefulfor engineering calculations.andM;MathCAD is capable of tracking units for time, distance, charge and mass, butit is more awkward than TK Solver at converting between units.andP;  PowerMath IIhas no special unit-handling facility.andM;TK Solver is also well-suited for storing large numbers of equations as aninformation database.andP;  Once user-defined functions have been programmed andrules have been stated, they can be used as the basis for solving newproblems.andP;  Merging a knowledge base with a TK Solver document is easy.andM;A number of frequently used relations are included with TK Solver as librarydocuments.andP;  Functions are provided with the program to handle financial,statistical and utilitarian tasks.andP;  TK Solver libraries, including Roark's5,000 stress and strain equations, can be purchased from Universal TechnicalSystems.andP;  Libraries developed on TK Solver for Unix, DOS and otherenvironments are compatible with the Mac version.andM;TK Solver, PowerMath II and MathCAD contain routines for graphingtwo-dimensional functions.andP;  None contain the flexibility or graphic controlprovided by most spreadsheet and charting programs.andP;  MathCAD alone has thecapability to construct 3-D surface plots.andM;Documentation and support.andP;  TK Solver documentation includes an introductionto the Mac version and a reference manual for all computer platforms.andP;  Bothparts are well-organized, thorough and easy to understand.andM;MathCAD's documentation is adequate in describing features, but it lackssufficient detail in many areas and is sometimes difficult to understand.andO;Many of the program's functions need more description.andM;Documentation for PowerMath II is the most concise.andP;  An overview of thetheory in the program, tutorials, examples and a troubleshooting section areincluded in a 76-page book.andM;All three equation solvers provide on-line help.andP;  TK Solver's is much morecomplete than the others and is context-sensitive, but all provide enoughinformation to be useful replacements for manuals most of the time.andP;  OnlyMathCAD offers a toll-free number for assistance, but we received straightanswers from all three publishers.andM;Conclusions.andP;  We found that each program had unique strengths and weaknesses,so choosing a program will depend largely on the particular problem to besolved.andM;Engineers will probably find TK Solver Plus to be most useful.andP;  Its abilitiesin tracking unit conversions, importing libraries of rules and functions, andstoring user-defined functions give it more muscle than the other packages.andO;Although it is awkward to set up for simple problems, the organization paysoff in handling large projects.andM;MathCAD should be a favorite for general-purpose use, especially if a futureversion cures the screen update and memory-  management problems.andP;  Theconcept of a blank scratch pad that can be filled in at random with a mixtureof math statements, graphs and explanatory text is appealing and will be theshortest path to the answer for most simple problems.andP;  What's more, a quickprintout of the scratch pad provides a permanent record of the solution andthe path to it.andM;PowerMath II will be most attractive to pure mathematicians and those whoneed symbolic solutions.andP;  Wherever documenting intermediate steps orperforming polynomial manipulations are necessary, PowerMath II is the bestchoice here.andP;  nandM;Linda Custer is a research biochemical engineer at W.R.andP;
