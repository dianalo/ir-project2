The first impetusfor such a framework was the early, successful development of The Geysersgeothermal field in northern California. The second impetus came fromthe 1972 oil embargo, which raised the demand for establishing federaland state financial incentives to encourage more rapid development ofgeothermal energy. The legal and institutional framework developed bythe state and federal governments commonly differed substantially informat, content, and direction. Too commonly the legal and institutionalframework left many questions unanswered, and in some cases, has provento be more of an obstacle to development than an aid. Upon examininghow state and federal governments have addressed the needs of geothermaldevelopment, and how the courts have interpreted these decisions, ithas become clear that the legal and institutional framework must addressthe following topics to serve adequately the needs of geothermal development:(1) providing developers with access and a priority right to carry outexploration and development activities; (2) characterizing the resourcesso as to minimize conflicts with other natural resources; (3) establishingownership; and (4) giving careful consideration to such lease terms asrentals, royalties, renewals, and diligence requirements. In addition,the framework must address ground water law and its implications forgeothermal development, and how geothermal development will be consideredin terms of established utility law.</TEXT></DOC>
