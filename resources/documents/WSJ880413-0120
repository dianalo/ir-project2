Ministers from Britain, France, West Germany and Spain, the consortium's principal backers, set Jan. 1, 1989, as the target for implementing the proposed changes. They also decided to aim at converting Airbus into a full-fledged corporation from its current status as a cooperative venture sometime after 1992.    Spanish Industry Minister Luis Carlos Croissier said the ministers agreed unanimously on the principles outlined in a report to them by a panel of four business executives. Bearing in mind previous discord among the consortium members, Kenneth Clarke, Britain's minister for trade and industry, said that &quot;the astonishing thing this morning was that we all agreed so quickly&quot; on the need for restructuring management, cutting costs and improving efficiency.    &quot;Airbus will have to become a project economically feasible on its own,&quot; he said.    One of the panel's key proposals was to reduce the size of the consortium's supervisory board and increase its powers, so that it would make major policy decisions. It also called for an end to the system of earmarking specific jobs at Airbus for members of specific nationalities and for the development of a clear career structure within the consortium.    In addition, the panel recommended the creation of a holding company that would accept outside shareholders alongside the four existing partners. This holding company would own the production facilities used by the consortium in Britain, France and West Germany, the panel suggested.    &quot;If Airbus Industrie does not take steps to constitute itself in the organizational manner we propose, we doubt whether Airbus can ever reach long-term profitability,&quot; the panel's report said.    The consortium, founded in 1970 as a joint venture between France and West Germany, has emerged in recent years as a formidable rival to Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. The U.S. aircraft makers have long complained that Airbus gains an unfair competitive edge through government subsidies. The proposed restructuring would presumably help wean the company from that aid and make it more accountable.    Until now, its management, controlled by the four participating nations' aeronautical industries, has been cumbersome. Its shareholders, Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace PLC, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain, all keep separate and secret accounts of their Airbus activities and don't reveal details of the flow of cash between themselves and the consortium.    Aerospatiale and MBB each own 37.9% of Airbus, while British Aerospace owns 20% and the Spanish concern 4.2%.    At the operating level, a predominance of committees and a requirement that partners accounting for 81% of shares should approve decisions have also contributed to Airbus's unwieldiness. </TEXT></DOC>
