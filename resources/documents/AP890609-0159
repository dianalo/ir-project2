Sakharov proposed in a nationallytelevised speech in Congress on Friday his own bold program forpolitical reform that would abolish the Communist Party's legalmonopoly on power.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev interrupted Sakharov from thedais, saying he had spoken twice as long as permitted, but the68-year-old Nobel Peace laureate continued, raising his voice andwaving his arms.   Sakharov, father of the Soviet human rights movement, told theCongress of People's Deputies on the final day of its inauguralsession that it had failed in its main task _ ``to establish asystem of power to overcome economic and social problems and put anend to ecological madness.''   The standing legislature chosen by the 2,250-member Congresscontains ``more than 50 percent idle functionaries,'' he charged.``So the Supreme Soviet will be used as a screen for the party andthe party apparatus.''   He also said Congress did Communist Party chief Gorbachev adisservice by electing him Soviet president when it convened May 25without considering alternative candidates.   ``In accordance with the Constitution, the (president) hasabsolute personal power concentrated in the hands of one person,''Sakharov said. ``I personally respect Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachevvery much, but it is dangerous to give so much power even to theinitiator of perestroika.''   Sakharov, elected to Congress from the Soviet Academy ofSciences, proposed his own ``Decree on Power'' that would end themonopoly on power the Communist Party has jealously guarded sincethe 1917 Russian Revolution.   He called for abolishing Article 6 of the Constitution, whichdeclares the 20-million member party ``the leading and guiding forceof Soviet society and the nucleus of its political system'' andgives the party the right to determine ``the general perspectives ofthe development of society and the course of the domestic andforeign policy of the U.S.S.R.''   Sakharov's proposal would also empower Congress to appoint thehead of the KGB secret police, the editor of the governmentnewspaper Izvestia, the chief of the Gostelradio state broadcastingauthority and other top leadership figures.   Sakharov said the Soviet president and those officials shouldreport to Congress alone to be ``independent from the party and theparty's bodies.''   He said KGB functions should be limited ``to ensuring theinternational security of the U.S.S.R.,'' which would mean an end toits widespread spying activities on Soviet citizens.   The activist, whom Gorbachev allowed to return to Moscow inDecember 1986 after nearly seven years of forced exile in the closedcity of Gorky, asked Congress to form a committee to consider hisproposal and to adopt it at an extraordinary sesssion.   He appealed on the live telecast for the support of the Sovietpeople, ``as they have done when there was an attempt to discreditSakharov to divert attention from the problem of the Afghan war.''   Sakharov's public criticism of the December 1979 Soviet militarypush into Afghanistan prompted his being exiled and stripped ofmedals and honors.   Sakharov also proposed creating an ``equal federal system'' togive the 15 constituent Soviet republics more rights and end decadesof top-heavy centralized control from Moscow.   Gorbachev tried to cut Sakharov off when he complained that aresolution adopted Tuesday by Congress on the recent violence inBeijing ``did not fully reflect the depth of the problem.''   The resolution called events in China, including the bloody armyattack on pro-democracy demonstrators, a purely ``internal affair.''   Gorbachev told Sakharov he had already spoken twice as long aspermitted by Congress' rules.   ``I respect Congress, but I respect the people who listen tome,'' Sakharov answered from the rostrum. ``I respect humanity.''</TEXT></DOC>
