He was the highest-ranking government official to lose hispost in a crackdown on political dissent.   Also Monday, the official news media reported that several topgovernment officials had been implicated in a campaign againstcorruption.   Wang Meng was dismissed from his job as culture minister by thestanding committee of the National People's Congress, China'slegislature.   Poet He Jingzhi, who has served as deputy chief of the rulingCommunist Party's propaganda deparment, was named to replace Wang,state-run national television and radio reported.   Premier Li Peng, who ordered martial law during student-ledpro-democracy protests last spring, submitted the proposal todismiss Wang, the official Xinhua news agency said.   China Central Television said Wang had ``repeatedly asked to berelieved of his official posts to concentrate on writing andliterary criticism.''   However, there was speculation Wang had been in trouble sinceChina launched the crackdown on dissent, beginning with a militaryassault on Beijing protesters on June 3-4 that killed hundreds,perhaps thousands, of unarmed civilians.   Wang did not appear with other ministers to greet the troops whoswept through Beijing to break up protests.   Previous news reports said Wang did not attend the party CentralCommittee meeting in late June that purged moderate party chief ZhaoZiyang, who sympathized with the spring protesters.   Zhao allowed a measure of freedom for China's writers andartists. Wang's appointment in 1986 was regarded as a sign of thegovernment's increasing tolerance of artistic expression. But thegovernment has been trying to reign in artists since crushing thepro-democracy movement.   As culture minister, Wang tried to walk a fine line betweenofficial ideology and artistic freedom.   Shortly before his appointment, Wang said, ``I honestly supportparty policy and also honestly stand for the creative freedom ofwriters. There's no contradiction.''   In their reports on the anti-corruption drive, the official presssaid Monday that the top trade official in south China's Guangdongprovince was dismissed for corruption.   Xu Yunian, director of the provincial Foreign Economic Relationsand Trade Committee, was under investigation for spending $57,000 inpublic funds on an imported car and portable telephones for hisprivate use and for taking advantage of his position to obtain afive-room apartment for his family, the reports said.   The Ministry of Supervision announced last week it was steppingup such investigations of high-ranking officials.   In addition, a Western diplomat in Hong Kong said Monday thatLiang Xiang, governor of the southern island province of Hainan, wasremoved from his post.   However, Hainan officials reached by telephone would say onlythat ``nothing has been decided.''   Liang, formerly party secretary in Shenzhen, a special economiczone next to Hong Kong, was close to Zhao and viewed as a symbol ofChina's economic reform. But reports from Hong Kong have said he wasunder investigation for encouraging family members to engage inprofiteering.</TEXT></DOC>
