Last week's market slide is casting a pall over the previous enthusiasm for U.S. shares in Tokyo, London and continental Europe. Some investors are effectively paralyzed: too deeply invested in the U.S. to pull out, yet too worried to resume buying.    A few now are cautiously looking for bargains. But across the board, the notion that foreign investors would continue to bid up U.S. stock prices into the late 1980s appears seriously shaken.    &quot;Japanese investors are really scared,&quot; says Motoi Okada, executive vice president of the U.S. unit of Japan's Daiwa Securities Co. Daiwa was previously expected to help lead a multibillion-dollar buying spree by Japan's investors this year. But now, says Mr. Okada, &quot;not only Japanese, but other foreign investors have lost some confidence in the U.S. market.&quot;    Similar apprehension has taken hold in London in recent days. &quot;My clients won't touch {U.S. stocks} right now,&quot; says Anthony Mulliner, a stockbroker at Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers.    Such gloom contrasts starkly with the foreigners' bullish mood earlier this year. Only last month, Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard andamp; Poor's Outlook, described foreign buying as &quot;the tail that's wagging the dog. It's been responsible for big gains this year, and has made U.S. investors confident that the market will keep moving up despite almost anything.&quot;    Foreign buying did seem to be taking off. Investors abroad made a record $18.9 billion of net purchases of U.S. stocks last year, more than tripling the previous annual record set in 1981. The 1986 total was surpassed in this year's first half alone, as foreigners' purchases minus their sales jumped to nearly $20 billion, according to U.S. government statistics.    But last Monday's 508-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average has sent foreigners scurrying to reassess their investment targets. &quot;At a crisis time like this, there is a natural inclination to retreat to domestic markets,&quot; says Michael Dobson, managing director of Morgan Grenfell Group PLC in London. His firm manages $28 billion of assets, about 10% of them in the U.S.    An outright exodus by foreigners is highly unlikely, analysts say. With holdings of about $163 billion of U.S. stocks at the end of 1986, foreigners would find it impractical to pull out abruptly, they say. Based on familiar yardsticks such as ratios of stock prices to corporate earnings, the U.S. market still compares favorably with those in other countries, notably Japan. Foreigners perceive strength in the American economy.    The market's rout even seems to have whetted the appetites of foreign companies that are on the prowl for U.S. acquisitions. &quot;It's a time of increased opportunity,&quot; says Martin Taylor, a director of Hanson Trust PLC, a British conglomerate that likes to acquire U.S. businesses. Asked if the U.S. bear market will keep Hanson away, Mr. Taylor replies: &quot;Absolutely not.&quot;    But many foreign investors are suddenly focusing on lingering U.S. problems. &quot;The fall of Wall Street and other markets is a cry of despair that the U.S. deficit won't be addressed, until the election of a president with sufficient stature and guts to tackle the problem,&quot; says Graeme MacLennan, managing director of Edinburgh Fund Managers in Scotland.    Before last week's market crash, Mr. MacLennan says, his firm had already reduced its exposure to the U.S. stock market to about 20% of its $1.6 billion of assets from 30% earlier this year. &quot;Maybe that {figure} will drift up again if the U.S. gets its act together,&quot; he says.    Portfolio manager Alan Kemp at Dunedin Fund Managers in Edinburgh has reduced his biggest client's U.S. holdings to 14%, the lowest level since 1970. Mr. Kemp adds that he sold &quot;a fair amount of stocks&quot; before last week, primarily because the U.S. government &quot;wasn't prepared to do anything&quot; about the budget deficit. If Congress and the White House &quot;continue to bury their heads in the sand,&quot; he says, &quot;I worry for all the world's markets.&quot;    Investors abroad were especially startled by the speed of the market's decline. Jean-Luc Lepine, director-general of Banque Demachy S.A., says the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 180 points when he left the Paris investment bank's offices for a business gathering at an elegant restaurant Monday. &quot;By the time the cheese came, it was down 300,&quot; he says. &quot;When we were all getting our coats on, somebody said it was down 508. We all thought he was joking.&quot;    Individuals in the past week have begun asking &quot;serious questions about restructuring portfolios,&quot; Mr. Lepine says. &quot;Many people want to get out of stocks entirely, whether the shares are in New York, London, Frankfurt or anywhere else.&quot;    Earlier this year, foreigners accounted for about 10% of the value of securities traded in the U.S. But according to Tony Constance, chief executive of Aitken Hume International PLC, a British firm that manages $3.5 billion in the U.S.: &quot;You don't have to be very bright to say the whole world is going to look rather skeptically at equities in the future.&quot;    In Tokyo, radio news of the market's collapse jolted Isao Ushikubo, general manager of the pension trust investment department at Toyo Trust andamp; Banking Co., out of bed on Tuesday morning. &quot;I couldn't grasp what was happening,&quot; Mr. Ushikubo says. &quot;I wasn't sure if they were saying 50 points or 500 points.&quot;    Mr. Ushikubo, who previously invested about 6% of the firm's $14 billion portfolio in the U.S. stock market, says he bought some U.S. equities Thursday and Friday but doesn't expect the overall market to recover quickly. &quot;To fully restore the price level may take two years or more,&quot; he says.    In New York on Tuesday, Ken Ninagawa, who handles U.S. investments for Japan's Nomura Securities Investment Trust Management Co., got many calls from Japanese fund managers looking for encouraging words. &quot;I didn't have any,&quot; he told a colleague, because he couldn't explain Monday's crash.    In Tokyo, Nomura's chief equities trader went 36 hours without sleep Monday and Tuesday, watching stock markets around the world plummet. The vigil was largely in vain. Nomura did little trading in the U.S. market last week, although it sold a small amount of stock. Mr. Ninagawa says Nomura is prepared to buy high-yield stocks such as utilities when the U.S. market stabilizes.    Foreigners who buy U.S. securities continue to face the additional risk that the dollar will sink, eroding their holdings' value. As the dollar has fallen in recent years against such major currencies as the British pound and Japanese yen, foreigners have taken huge currency losses on their American investments. According to Francis H. Schott, chief economist at Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., Japanese insurers alone incurred losses of $20 billion on U.S. stocks and bonds last year. (In the U.S. markets, Japanese investors hold far more bonds than equities.)    Now the direction of the dollar is more uncertain than ever. If the U.S. decides to bolster its market by pumping money into the economy, accelerating inflation could put downward pressure on the dollar. But if the U.S. tightens the money supply to check inflation, a recession might result, hurting corporate earnings and stock prices.    Many Europeans are worried by the prospect of an economic slump in the U.S. &quot;There's going to be a recession, the only question is when,&quot; says Roger Nightingale, a group strategist with Hoare Govett Ltd. in London. &quot;We have penciled in 1989 as the year of a pretty nasty world recession.&quot; Mr. Nightingale thinks any recession could be especially severe in the U.S., where he expects politicians to keep the economy strong until next year's election, then &quot;slam on the brakes.&quot;    West Germans are &quot;licking their wounds&quot; and aren't eager to buy U.S. stocks, says Dieter Wermuth, a vice president for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in Frankfurt. He is advising German investors to wait a bit before going back to U.S. equities.    &quot;Today might be a good time to buy,&quot; Mr. Wermuth says, but &quot;there may be a better time.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
