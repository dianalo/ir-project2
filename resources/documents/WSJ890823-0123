In one Washington -- the one of capital-gains taxes, the budget deficit and August heat and humidity -- Rep. Foley has gained a reputation as a cautious politician, a man who can carefully analyze a situation from all sides before prescribing a course of action.    In this other Washington, where a farmer lights a bonfire to take the chill off an August evening and where the wheat fields meet the blue spruce trees at the far horizon, are the origins of a man who grew up in a liberal Democratic family surrounded by conservative Republican neighbors.    A brief trip with the new House speaker to his eastern Washington congressional district provides hints of the forces that shaped him and his politics, filling in a portrait of a man secure and comfortable with himself.    Rep. Foley, still enjoying a honeymoon as speaker, is broadly praised for reducing the partisan strife in the House and for getting the chamber back to business after the upheaval that saw a speaker resign in disgrace for the first time ever. A student of history, Mr. Foley is disappointed that he has few strong memories of the history of which he has just been a part. &quot;It's sort of a blur, less distinctive in my mind than I expected,&quot; he says. &quot;It seems like two years or three years instead of a few months.&quot;    Mr. Foley knows he must cast his attention forward. Now that he has shown he can make the legislative trains run on time, he has to indicate what he wants those trains to carry, putting his mark on legislation. He has made House passage of a package of ethics reforms this fall a top priority and staked out such stands as opposition to a cut in the taxes on capital gains, a fight he acknowledges is uphill. But he offers few long-range goals.    He does speak, with emotion, of the distress he feels over the growing underclass in U.S. society, &quot;the alienation and separation of economic classes in this country.&quot; He adds: &quot;I would really like to bring about some amelioration of that. If it continues to grow, it could weaken the fabric of American democracy.&quot;    The son of a Spokane judge, Mr. Foley, who is 60 years old, was spared the personal sting of the Depression that so shaped his predecessors as speaker, Thomas O'Neill and James Wright. &quot;Growing up in the '30s, I remember relative great comfort,&quot; he says. But now, riding in a white Lincoln Town Car along two-lane highways winding through the rolling wheat fields of the Palouse region in southeastern Washington, through towns with names like Dusty and Rosalia, Mr. Foley recalls being shown another side of life.    During those years, his father would take the family on Sunday drives -- but not only to the countryside. The sights included the county poorhouse, soup kitchens and shantytowns where Mr. Foley says he saw &quot;men standing in line waiting for a five-cent glass of buttermilk to keep themselves alive.&quot;    &quot;It was a constant sort of effort to show me the circumstances of people less comfortable than ourselves,&quot; he says. &quot;If he hadn't made these efforts, I can understand how people lose total touch with the circumstances of others.&quot; His father never preached the point, but &quot;the lesson was there,&quot; Rep. Foley says.    But as much as Mr. Foley would like to put aiding the underclass high among the House's priorities, he acknowledges that the days when a speaker can singlehandedly advance an agenda are gone. Senior lawmakers no longer offer new ones the counsel that the late Rep. Michael Kirwan (D., Ohio) offered when Mr. Foley was a freshman: &quot;Trust the leadership, follow the leadership and do not make a single mistake.&quot;    &quot;The most powerful job I ever had was when I was a deputy prosecuting attorney,&quot; he muses. &quot;I'd just sign a piece of paper and a man went to jail. . . . Everything in Congress now operates in terms of a consensus. It's very much a collective undertaking, accommodating the views of other people, learning what is necessary to get their support.&quot;    Mr. Foley learned to understand and accommodate views different from his own as a young boy, both from his father -- the impartiality of Judge Ralph Foley is legend in Spokane even today, four years after his death -- and his surroundings. The neighborhood where he grew up was solidly Republican. His mother put a National Recovery Act sticker in the window, but only in the back of the house. &quot;We had an outpost, frontier Democratic Party identity,&quot; he recalls. &quot;The fact my family was Democratic was excused the way some strange religious practice was.&quot;    As a youth, he engaged in a kind of sandbox political debate, ardently defending Franklin Roosevelt to his next-door neighbor and playmate, the son of the Spokane County GOP chairman. The friend would taunt him by digging furiously with a shovel while chanting, &quot;Free enterprise,&quot; and then resting on the shovel and saying, &quot;WPA.&quot; Young Thomas Foley would rebut by doing just the opposite.    Returning home now to his largely rural district, Mr. Foley has the same presence that is familiar to those who know him in the nation's capital. He is always gracious and proper, but never stuffy or unapproachable. In meetings with constituents, Mr. Foley makes little effort to hide his Eastern sophistication. Wheat farmers pepper him with questions about world politics, and he responds with detailed analyses of the situations in Poland, the Soviet Union and China -- and assesses the new Japanese prime minister to boot.    When one wheat farmer expresses fear about automatic budget cuts that would crimp agriculture programs, Speaker Foley assures him that will probably be avoided this year, but could be a problem next year. &quot;You can do something about it, or you can sit back and watch the train wreck,&quot; he responds, plainly indicating that he won't sit back.    Yet he mixes easily with these people. At a coffee klatch, he recognizes faces and recalls names with ease. He glides through the crowd, happily addressing one by one the smaller circle of voters moving with him.    Certainly, some Republicans hope Mr. Foley will become such a national figure that he'll lose touch with the voters here. &quot;We're concerned he'll be playing up to the more liberal wing of his party, rather than representing his conservative district,&quot; says Robert Yates, a Republican precinct committeeman.    But even most Republicans think he has been good for the district and take pride in the new speaker. And Mr. Yates acknowledges, &quot;the people of this district would be foolish not to vote for him because of the power he does wield.&quot;    Rep. Foley, who stands six feet four inches and weighs more than 240 pounds, is very careful about his appearance, changing clothes as many as three times a day. Dressing casually for a watermelon feed at a 1,000-acre wheat farm northeast of Walla Walla means changing from a gray pin-stripe suit to a blue blazer and gray slacks, each jacket with a neatly folded white handkerchief peeking from the breast pocket. Another time, spotting a television camera waiting for him at an Elks hall here in Walla Walla, where he is to address the Rotary Club, he instructs his driver to circle the parking lot so he may don his suit jacket before emerging from the car.    No matter how hard he tries, though, he usually ends up looking comfortably rumpled, his back shirttail hanging out, like a little boy who has been playing after church in his Sunday best.    Indeed, there's a lot of little boy in Thomas Foley. He still relishes with glee the memory of a favorite present from a Christmas long ago, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police uniform. He loves gadgets and proudly shows off his latest addition, a cellular telephone that folds to pocket-size, with the same delight. He misplaces his reading glasses with such regularity that aides carry extras.    Most voters here find these enthusiasms and mannerisms endearing, and are proud that the man they have chosen to represent them for the past 25 years has been chosen to lead the House. Mr. Foley may be &quot;Mr. Speaker&quot; in the Washington far away from here, but sitting at a picnic table in the glow of fields of newly harvested wheat, brilliantly illuminated by the setting sun, he's affectionately addressed as &quot;Tom.&quot;    &quot;It's a real honor to have the speaker from our district,&quot; says Wayne Klindworth of nearby Connell. &quot;He's done very well by us,&quot; adds Bob Schwerin, the patriarch of this family farm. &quot;He's still our man.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
