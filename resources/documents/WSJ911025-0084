In his opinion, Palm Beach County Court Judge Robert V.Parker declared that a state law prohibiting the publishingof rape victims' names violated the First Amendment, whichprotects freedom of the press. &quot;No valid competing stateinterest is served by punishing defendant for publishing atruthful account of information it had lawfully acquired,&quot;the judge wrote.</LP><TEXT>   Under the 1911 criminal statute at issue in the case, theGlobe could have been convicted of a misdemeanor for printingthe name of the alleged victim last April. &quot;Georgia and SouthCarolina have similar laws,&quot; according to Carey Haughwout, ofthe West Palm Beach law firm Tierney andamp; Haughwout, whorepresented the Globe in the case. Most newspapers in otherstates, however, do not publish the names of alleged rapevictims.   In his opinion, Judge Parker made note of the publicnature of the controversy surrounding the events at theKennedy family estate last spring. &quot;Since the story involvesa Kennedy, it is a national and international media event ofthe year, one of such magnitude that it is to be doubted thatscientists working and living in igloos at the South Polewould be able to remain ignorant,&quot; the judge wrote.   He also ruled that the Globe's method of news gathering,including &quot;listening to gossip in the bars and clubs of PalmBeach,&quot; was lawful.   Hailing the decision, First Amendment specialist P.Cameron DeVore, of the Seattle law firm Davis WrightTremaine, said, &quot;You cannot put a fence around something thatis in the public domain, however difficult or howeveranguishing it is.&quot;   The judge's decision that the statute was unconstitutionalwas based partly on a 1989 U.S. Supreme Court decision in acivil case in which a Florida newspaper was sued for naming arape victim. The high court ruled in favor of the newspaper.   The Supreme Court decision pointed out that the state law,as applied in that case, was too broad because publicationscould be held liable for naming a rape victim &quot;regardless ofwhether the victim is already known throughout the community,or whether the victim has voluntarily called public attentionto the offense, or whether the identity of the victim hasotherwise become a reasonable subject of public concern. . ..&quot;   David H. Bludworth, the state prosecutor who brought thecase against the Globe, said he would appeal yesterday'sdecision. He said the ruling could have a &quot;chilling effect onreporting rape.&quot;   &quot;Why is it that an otherwise private person, because theyhappen to be a victim of someone who is alleged to be famous,. . . becomes a significant public figure?&quot; Mr. Bludworthasked. He said he believed the statute was &quot;not offensive tothe First Amendment on balance.&quot;   The case has been closely watched by news organizations.Several, including the New York Times and The Wall StreetJournal, filed friend-of-the-court briefs supporting theGlobe. The Times also published the name of the allegedvictim.   ---   JURY RECOMMENDS BIG AWARD against Sunshine Mining.   A Texas state court jury in Dallas recommended an award toDallas businessmen Jean and Franco Boulle of slightly morethan $39 million in a suit against Sunshine Mining Co., atroubled Texas silver mining company.   Sunshine originally filed the lawsuit against the Boullesin 1990, alleging they had wrongfully dissolved a partnershipset up to develop a diamond mine in Sierra Leone. The Boullebrothers countersued, also alleging wrongful dissolution ofthe deal and breach of fiduciary responsibility. The Boullesprevailed in the jury trial.   The jury found actual damages of $24,255,000 based on aformula derived from the value of the partnership'sassetswhich the jury found to be $620 million -- minus thepartnership's liabilities. The jury also recommended punitivedamages of $15 million.   Under the law, state court Judge Joseph Morris must puttogether the final judgment. His judgment may be differentthan the jury's award, but it must be based on the numbersused by the jury to reach its recommendation, including thevalue of the assets and its estimate of punitive damages.   Sunshine said it intends to pursue &quot;any remedies&quot;available, including filing a motion for a new trial andappealing the case. The company said it thought the juryfindings were &quot;erroneous&quot; and the damages were &quot;grosslyexcessive.&quot;   Stephen Malouf, an attorney for the Boulles, said hisclients would prefer to negotiate an agreement to continuethe project and the partnership. Barring that, he said, thebrothers will ask the judge to award as much as $617 millionin damages, using the jury's $620 million value of assetsminus $3 million that the Boulles believe are the project'sliabilities.   A Sunshine official declined to comment on the possibilityof negotiations with the Boulles.   The verdict is likely to frustrate the company's effortsto refinance some of its debt. Sunshine has offered to swapstock and new silver-indexed bonds for $58.3 million in oldSunshine Precious Metals silver-indexed bonds. In April, thecompany's Precious Metals unit stopped making interest andprincipal payments on its bonds after Sunshine refused toadvance it the cash needed to do so.   In September, the company threatened to file a prepackagedChapter 11 bankruptcy-law petition if debt holders didn'tagree to the stock swap. But yesterday, Sunshine officialssaid the swap is on hold because of the litigation with theBoulles.   Suffering from low silver prices, the company has alsoomitted dividends on its preferred stock for the past threequarters, and earlier in the year, bought back $51 million ofits $55 million in 8 7/8% convertible subordinated resetdebentures for $600 and 200 shares of stock for each $1,000face amount in a move to reduce debt.   ---   MASTERCARD CAN RUN ad poking fun at American Express,judge rules.   A federal judge ruled that, pending a coming trial,MasterCard International can broadcast a new commercial thatportrays American Express Co. customers as having difficultygetting cash with their cards. American Express asked thejudge to block the ad prior to trial, claiming that it madefalse claims.   U.S. Judge Constance Baker Motley in Manhattan ruled thatthe new commercial &quot;isn't explicitly false in any way,&quot; andthus that no injunction can be granted. The judge cited thenumber of places that a person can get cash with the cards:260,000 world-wide for MasterCard, compared with 44,700 forAmerican Express.   &quot;Since fewer locations means that they may be harder tolocate, the explicit message is truthful,&quot; the judge said.   The commercial shows a man asking futilely for cash whilewaving his American Express card and includes a scene inwhich strangers try to give him directions, such as &quot;gothrough a corset store&quot; and &quot;in back, there's a dirt road.&quot;   An American Express spokeswoman said the company &quot;believesthe ad to be false and misleading&quot; and will&quot; continue topursue all appropriate remedies.&quot;   Although the judge refused to issue an order blocking thead, she ruled that a trial can be held on whether the ad isimplicitly false or misleads consumers. That trial is set tobegin Nov. 25.   ---   COURT PRAYER: judge who opened his court with a prayerviolated the constitutional separation of church and state, afederal appeals court ruled. The Fourth U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals in Richmond, Va., upheld a lower court ruling thatbarred state Judge H. William Constangy of North Carolinafrom reciting a prayer from the bench, according to theAssociated Press. Judge Constangy likened prayer in acourtroom to prayers that open legislative sessions. Theappeals court, however, said the U.S. Supreme Court has ruledthat legislative prayers are acceptable because they are atradition that started with the framers of the Constitution.   ---   NOTED: Former Washington Mayor Marion Barry is underorders to begin serving a six-month prison sentence forcocaine possession on Saturday, after an appeals court'srefusal to grant a delay.
