Even the mayor.    The illicit goods of choice? U.S. television shows: football games, sitcoms, porn flicks, anything it can grab from U.S.-based satellite-delivered television services.    Dawson first began receiving satellite signals in the late 1970s, from New York-based Home Box Office Inc. It was tired of the dross provided free by Canadian Broadcasting Corp. and couldn't afford Canada's own satellite service. So Dawson invested in a receiving dish and a transmitter and began distributing the HBO signals to all 800 residents.    Soon the town was addicted. Indeed, when HBO began scrambling signals in 1986, Mayor Peter Jenkins drove 130 miles to Eagle, Alaska, and bought his suffering citizens a descrambler. Since Canadians aren't allowed to subscribe to U.S. pay-TV services, Mr. Jenkins used an assumed name to rent an Eagle post-office box in which to receive HBO's $19 monthly bill.    The scheme worked and might have kept on working, except for one thing: Because of time differences, Dawson received HBO's late-night adult channel right around the time its children finished supper. This greatly upset Pentacostal minister Russell Brackenbury, a recent arrival in town: &quot;Last summer, we circulated a petition to stop it, got 65 or 70 signatures, and presented it to City Council,&quot; he says.    Mayor Jenkins responded by giving free blackout devices to the protesters. But that wasn't good enough: Someone in Dawson -- nobody knows who -- snitched to HBO about the town's illegal addiction. Last month, the company electronically blocked Dawson's descrambler, and suddenly the town had to do without.    But not for long. Within a few weeks, Mayor Jenkins had arranged for Dawson to procure signals from another U.S. pay-TV service -- one whose blue movies arrive only after the kids are in bed.    That solved one problem. But now a reporter wants to know the new service's name. &quot;If you write it up, I'm sure we'll lose them,&quot; says the mayor, dodging the question. Other citizens are equally cagey, even Sgt. Brian Gudmundson, who heads the local Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment. &quot;I've just been watching the hockey playoffs on the CBC,&quot; he says, and won't say more. </TEXT></DOC>
