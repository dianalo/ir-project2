It is mainly due to computer projections that forecast a steadyrise of SO{sub 2} emissions through 1980s as a result of increased coalutilisation. The National Coal Association, USA, undertook three separatestudies on SO{sub 2} emissions. These studies, which cover the years1980 through 1984, 1985 and 1986, indicate that the projected increasein SO{sub 2} emission will not occur, and that emissions in 1990 willbe lower than they were in 1980. 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
