For this reason, many techniques have been developedin the past. However, most of them suffer from poor sensitivity, lowspectral and temporal resolution, and applications limited to vacuumsolid interfaces. Recently, the second harmonic generation (SHG) techniquewas proved repeatedly to be a simple but versatile surface probe. Itis highly sensitive and surface specific; it is also capable of achievinghigh temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution. Being an optical technique,it can be applied to any interface accessible by light. The only seriousdrawback is its lack of molecular selectivity. An obvious remedy is theextension of the technique to IR-visible sum frequency generation (SFG).Surface vibrational spectroscopy with submonolayer sensitivity is thenpossible using SFG with the help of a tunable IR laser. The authors reporthere an SFG measurement of the C-H stretch vibration of monolayers ofmolecules at air-solid and air-liquid interfaces.</TEXT></DOC>
