U.S.-Soviet detente and congressional budget-cuttinghasten pink slips for white-collar and hourly employeesalike. McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed, GE, General Dynamics andsome small firms disclose plans to trim rolls. The AerospaceIndustries Association tracks 16,000 job-cut notices amongits 54 members in 1990, 28% ahead of its forecast. &quot;This mayjust be the beginning,&quot; warns AIA economist David Napier.</LP><TEXT>   The passenger-plane business, once viewed as a cushion,doesn't help much: Boeing isn't ramping up new programs, soit's laying off, too, and McDonnell Douglas's commercial unitflounders. Firms search for new niches to keep employmentstable, but changing course is tough.   &quot;There will always be some growth areas,&quot; such aselectronics, says Karen Berk of the job-matching AerospaceHuman Resources Network.                                                                                                          HANDLING HAZARDS lessen for use of aircraft &quot;composites.&quot;   As plane makers add more of the light, reinforced fibersin their designs, they alert workers on how to better plytoxic chemicals that strengthen and coat composites.   Worker complaints decline with increased industry concern,better training and new cautionary signs posted in plants,the Machinists union says. A third of the cost of Lockheed'snew Palmdale, Calif., composites center is for properventilation and other health controls.   An Occupational Safety and Health Administration crackdownlast year at Boeing and Lockheed helped spur the effort. Now,manufacturers push suppliers of advanced composites to setspecific exposure limits. &quot;If we don't do it, they're notgoing to buy from us,&quot; says David Forest, head of BASFStructural Materials.                                                                                                          PEACETIME &quot;CONVERSION&quot; moves ahead at federal and statelevels.   House members prepare wording for the defenseauthorization bill on the need to help defense workers bracefor the changeover. It would list worker qualifications forrelocation and other allowances when defense cuts hit. Morecontroversial ideas, such as requiring weapons makers to payfor retraining and benefits, will be saved for floor debate.   &quot;We want to make sure at least something gets on thetable,&quot; says Rep. Nick Mavroules (D., Mass.), a member of abipartisan House-Senate task force on the issue. Californiamulls a worker-retraining program; in Minnesota, stung by biglayoffs by Unisys, Honeywell and other defense firms, a new0.1% payroll tax raises worker aid. Over 40 aerospace firmsmet in Dayton, Ohio, last week to share tips on switching tonon-military work.   One big challenge, says Ohio Gov. Celeste: meeting thecivilian sector's tougher delivery standards.                                                                                                          LOWER YOUR WAGE RATES, the Pentagon tells Lockheed, Boeingand other companies. They must bring pay in line with otherfirms in their areas, or the government says it will findother sources. The Defense Contract Audit Agency contests$222 million in &quot;unreasonable&quot; labor charges. Unions grousethat contractors are exploiting the issue at the bargainingtable.                                                                                                          BLACK PROGRAMS, WHITE FACES: Asians, Hispanics and blacksmake up only 16% of workers in aerospace, with its oftensecret, or &quot;black,&quot; programs, lagging behind the overalleconomy, the General Accounting Office finds. GeneralDynamics's space division agrees to offer employment and$270,000 in back wages to 21 minority engineers whom theLabor Department says were wrongly denied jobs.                                                                                                          BRAIN DRAIN: Of 30 companies surveyed by the AIA,two-thirds say they're short of scientists and engineers, and85% expect such problems in the future. So firms do more tosupport education, with 40% of corporate contributions goingfor aid, such as scholarships.                                                                                                          OLD AEROSPACE WORKERS don't fade away -- they go back towork.   More cost-conscious jet makers take back retirees, forquick, complex assignments. &quot;We know what they're capableof,&quot; says Vince DeBlaze, human resources director atMcDonnell Douglas's jet-fighter factory in St. Louis, whichemploys about 200 of its retirees. While fast-food firms hiremany retirees for low-skill work, &quot;we've shown you can do itwith high-tech,&quot; says ACS Management Group Inc.   Bob Stein, a manager at Fairchild Controls, says a formerHughes master scheduler he hired briefly for a new program tobuild environmental controls for jet-fighter components &quot;wasable to work faster and smarter -- and then press on.&quot;   ACS's Graybeard division, a job shop for former aerospacetechnicians, has 2,300 resumes.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: Machinists at Lockheed'ssoon-to-be-shuttered, 62-year-old factory in Burbank, Calif.,staged a rally last weekend to keep their jobs. . . . Boeingsays that for each job created outside the U.S. by its&quot;foreign sourcing,&quot; 20 domestic jobs are spawned. . . .Northrop holds job fairs to recruit workers for its B-2Stealth bomber project, saying, &quot;You just might wind upmaking history.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
