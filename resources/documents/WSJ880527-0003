Christian Hill (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> TNM BNK </IN><TEXT>   A San Francisco-based investment fund will contribute $100 million in new equity to acquire long-troubled Eureka Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, of San Carlos, Calif., with federal assistance, according to people familiar with the deal.    The acquisition of Eureka, which has $1.69 billion in assets, is expected to be announced next week. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board hopes the deal will bolster its claims that it can attract significant amounts of new capital to the thrift industry in the mergers the agency assists.    However, Eureka's acquirer, which government and industry sources identified as America First Financial Corp., was founded specifically to invest in failing savings institutions, so its capital contribution is no surprise. And America First is said to have commanded favorable terms from the Bank Board.    Also, the transaction won't dispel doubts about how much capital investors are willing to pour into sick thrifts in the depressed Texas economy. The Bank Board has said potential bidders have $1 billion to invest in Texas thrifts, which make up almost half of the nation's insolvent, federally insured thrifts. Yet its Texas thrift mergers thus far have drawn little new capital.    Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, alluded to the transaction in congressional testimony yesterday without naming the participants. He said the Bank Board is &quot;pleased&quot; to be able to attract that amount of capital.    He also voiced satisfaction at unloading Eureka, which entered 1988 with a tangible negative net worth of $276 million. &quot;It is one that has been on the list of troubled institutions for no less than three years and it is one that, clearly, we are pleased to get -- to get resolved.&quot;    The Bank Board installed new directors and management at Eureka in June 1985, after a string of bad real estate development loans went sour and wiped out its net worth.    Since the Bank Board usually provides enough assistance to eliminate the negative net worth of the acquired thrift, this deal could cost it close to $300 million.    The transaction comes as the Bank Board faces growing criticism for merging some insolvent thrifts into weakly capitalized institutions. Last week, it helped a Dallas institution with only $27.6 million in regulatory capital to acquire four thrifts with combined assets of $4 billion and negative net worth of $925 million.    Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) said yesterday there is &quot;a basis for concern&quot; that undercapitalized mergers will lead to more losses.    It's understood that America First will sell a portion of Eureka to a third party that industry sources wouldn't identify. America First is headed by Stephen McLin, a former executive vice president of BankAmerica Corp. who engineered some of BankAmerica's profitable acquisitions of other banks and financial-services companies. Mr. McLin declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
