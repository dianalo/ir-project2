Bartlett Giamatti got his man. Pete Rose salvaged some pride -- and at least a slim possibility of a future in baseball. And Major League Baseball closed the books on an embarrassing episode.    But baseball's settlement with Mr. Rose, which called for banning him from the game for at least a year, carried a high price: Fans may never know definitively what Mr. Rose did and didn't do.    That's because the settlement in the gambling case, announced by Mr. Giamatti yesterday, doesn't compel Mr. Rose, baseball's all-time hit leader, to admit that he gambled on baseball. And it doesn't compel him to seek counseling for his alleged gambling habit.    Indeed, using language similar to that in Securities and Exchange Commission consent decrees, the agreement states that Mr. Rose neither denies nor admits that he bet on any major league baseball game. Mr. Giamatti, however, said he concluded Mr. Rose bet on baseball, including the team he managed, the Cincinnati Reds.    The high-profile sports case, coming on the heels of major settlements in Wall Street insider-trading suits, highlights the trade-off that's made whenever any two parties compromise rather than fight out their battle in court. The case is resolved, but the facts remain uncertain and blame is never fully assigned.    Many lawyers insist that it's almost always better to settle a civil case rather than go to trial -- public sentiment notwithstanding. And they back up their opinion with action: Nationally, more than 90% of all civil cases end in settlements. In criminal cases last year in the Southern District of New York, 83% of the resolved cases were plea agreements.    &quot;The parties have gone to court because they want resolution,&quot; says Bud Holman, who represented Union Carbide Corp. in the Bhopal, India, poison-gas case. &quot;So the sooner you get resolution, the better off both parties are. And there's a public good in ending conflict and having resolution.&quot;    The advantages of settling are obvious: Both parties avoid the risk of a worse outcome if they leave the case to a judge or jury, they reduce their legal fees and they put the matter behind them. In addition, sometimes they succeed in keeping confidential matters from the public, a factor that corporations often find compelling.    Says Stanley Chesley, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Cincinnati, &quot;Litigation is not for the public. It's for the parties. The public interest in high-profile cases is still secondary to the client's interests. And that's the hardest thing for the public to understand.&quot;    Yet some lawyers and legal scholars point out that, in addition to resolving disputes, the court system traditionally serves another function. It provides a forum for fact-finding, through the laborious process of court-compelled discovery, that often sheds light on matters of public concern.    And it serves as a place where major public issues -- such as abortion, prayer in schools, responsibility for environmental cleanup and school desegregation -- are aired, debated and decided. Some would argue that gambling in sports is another such issue.    &quot;Broadly speaking, most run-of-the-mill cases should be settled,&quot; says public-interest litigator Rob Hager of Washington, D.C. &quot;There are other cases where you have questions of value, political principle, morality, such as Brown vs. Board of Education. . . . There's no way you can settle out these matters of principle.&quot;    Indeed, lawyers who bring cases involving constitutional issues generally won't settle. &quot;Essentially, in constitutional cases the objective of the defendant is to take some power away from the government which the government wants to take away from the individual or the entity,&quot; says James Goodale, former general counsel at the New York Times. &quot;When you settle, you always get half a loaf.&quot;    Constitutional issues tend to resurface, sometimes after many years and Mr. Goodale argues that a constitutional case is better off tried -- and lost -- than settled. The case can be appealed &quot;or when the next case comes along, you can always say it's different from the one you lost,&quot; he says.    In the Pentagon Papers case, in which the government tried to prevent the New York Times from printing excerpts from leaked documents, the Justice Department suggested a compromise whereby the paper would present the documents to the department and negotiate about what would be printed. The Times rejected the proposal and won the case in the Supreme Court. A settlement, says Mr. Goodale, &quot;would have been terrible and I think that's true of any constitutional case.&quot;    More complicated are cases that raise important legal or policy questions but also have major financial consequences for both parties.    Whether to settle or to litigate in an effort to find the truth emerged as a major issue in the suit against Union Carbide over the Dec. 3, 1984, toxic-gas leak at a plant in Bhopal. While Union Carbide pushed for settlement, some plaintiff groups vehemently opposed any resolution that failed to assess blame and add to the public's knowledge of the toxic effects of the gas that leaked from the pesticide plant.    Still pushing for the Indian Supreme Court to reject the current $470 million settlement plan and mandate a trial instead, Indian public-interest lawyer Indira Jaising says, &quot;Without a trial, nobody will know why the accident occurred.&quot;    Union Carbide's lawyer, Mr. Holman, sees it differently, noting that a trial might produce mounds of evidence but possibly nothing so profound as the truth. &quot;After a trial, do you have absolute truth? Only God knows if there is absolute truth, and God doesn't tell us.&quot;    Criminal cases provide different circumstances because the public has a keen interest in seeing justice done and innocent defendants are extremely reluctant to plead guilty. But even in the criminal arena, there's a strong bias for settling.    Like most prosecutors, Benito Romano, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, sees no advantages to taking a case to trial if it can be settled. In the case of former Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. arbitrager Robert Freeman, who will plead guilty to one count of mail fraud on Sept. 5, Mr. Romano says a public airing of the facts wasn't a consideration in his office's decision to settle the case.    Mr. Romano's goal, so long as a defendant acknowledges sufficient guilt, is to settle cases quickly so his troops can be deployed on other investigations. &quot;The public interest is vindicated when we, and the probation department and the sentencing court, in a public process, review openly the relevant facts in sentencing,&quot; he says.    Defense attorney Gary Naftalis understands the public's frustration with settlements, especially in high profile cases. But Mr. Naftalis, who unsuccessfully defended E. Robert Wallach, former attorney to then-attorney general Edwin Meese, in his recent influence-peddling trial, said it doesn't make sense to go to trial &quot;so the public's prurient interest is satisfied.&quot;    Stanley Arkin, another defense specialist -- who defended Richard Wigton, the Kidder Peabody Co. trader, against insider-trading charges that were recently dropped -- said that getting a case &quot;off your balance sheet or out of your mind&quot; is a good reason to settle a case if a client is guilty or likely to be found guilty.    In the Rose case, which didn't involve criminal charges, some observers considered the settlement terms surprising in that they didn't include any admission of wrongdoing or contrition on the part of Mr. Rose. And, at a news conference yesterday, Mr. Rose said, &quot;I didn't bet on baseball.&quot;    But others saw the banishment &quot;for life&quot; as significant, even though Mr. Rose can apply for reinstatement in a year. &quot;Giamatti has come out of it remarkably well. He basically delivered a very tough reinforcement of the commissioner's powers,&quot; said Lee Eisenberg, a founder of Rotisserie League baseball, a simulated baseball league, and editor in chief of Esquire magazine.    The settlement prevented a hearing before Mr. Giamatti on the betting allegations. Still, a great deal of information about Mr. Rose's alleged actions has already been revealed. Notes Mr. Eisenberg, &quot;In most cases, a settlement does deprive us of information, but in this case, I can't imagine that there's more that would come out.&quot;    The hearing before Mr. Giamatti wouldn't have been public, lawyers say. It might, however, have produced information that could have been used against Mr. Rose in any possible criminal investigation of his conduct. He still may face criminal tax-law violations. Says Chicago litigator Don Reuben, &quot;He doesn't want to go before Giamatti and have a transcript, with possible criminal charges that might be considered. He needs that like a hole in the head.&quot;    ---@ To Settle or Not to Settle . . . @ Advantages of Settling @ -- Avoids high cost of litigating. @ -- Averts the risk of a worse outcome at trial. @ -- Keeps the court system from clogging up. @ Advantage of a trial @ -- Offers opportunity for complete and public victory. @ -- Allows facts to be uncovered that might benefit the @ client and the public. @ -- Makes an example of a wrongdoer. </TEXT></DOC>
