Thirty-two-bit microcomputers are cheaper thanworkstations, yet more powerful than traditional microcomputers.andO;In addition, microcomputers may soon come with features that havebeen standard on workstations, such as Ethernet connections,higher resolution and bigger displays.andP;  One gap that remainsinvolves computer graphics.andP;  Workstation applications need atleast 4Mbytes of RAM, and many require an Mpixel display.andO;Workstations, however, lack microcomputers' ease of use.andP;  Inaddition, microcomputer applications have been written at a fairlylow-level to accommodate a 1- or 2Mbyte memory.andP;  Workstationapplications require more than this.andP;  Microcomputer andworkstation vendors' approaches to system design are alsodiscussed.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     MicrocomputersWorkstationsPerformance-Cost RelationshipIndustry AnalysisSystem Design.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
