The nation's largest retailers on Thursday reported they had goodsales gains last month, but some industry analysts speculated thatif stores had more merchandise to sell, their January volume mighthave been better.   This trend may continue. Retailers were still wary about demandprospects when they placed their orders for the next several months,so their stock will remain low.   ``Consumers looking for heavy markdowns may be disappointed,''said Edward Johnson, a retail specialist with the investment firmPrescott Ball andamp; Turben Inc. ``I don't think you will see them in thespring 1989 season either.''   Goods were sharply depleted during December as business surpassedexpectations. Also, stores didn't have much merchandise left overafter Christmas because they had held inventories in check to avoidhaving to run clearance sales with drastic price cuts.   Unseasonably warm weather throughout much of the country probablyencouraged people to go out shopping last month, analysts said.   By far, the brightest spot in the industry was women's apparel.   Jeffrey Feiner, a vice president at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., saidapparel retailers have enjoyed a resurgence over the past few monthsand will probably continue to benefit from women's favorablereactions to the more conservative styles now in the stores.   Johnson, of Prescott Ball andamp; Turben, believes higher outlays forwomen's clothes will lead the turnaround in general merchandisespending. People will steer a larger share of their spendable incometoward general merchandisers and away from autodealers, for instance.   As he put it, ``Women have stopped sitting on their hands.''   Limited Inc., the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer,reported a 34 percent jump in overall sales last month, while salesat stores open at least a year _ known as same-store sales in theindustry _ rose 28 percent.   Retailers and industry analysts believe same-store sales are amore accurate measure of a company's performance than figures thatinclude sales from new stores.   Analysts recommended against attaching too much significance tothe tallies because January is the least important month on theindustry's calendar.   ``January is such an insignificant month. January's a cleanupmonth after Christmas. If you had a couple of good days, that makesa big difference,'' observed Jeffrey Edelman of Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc.   Moreover, several store executives and analysts explained that atleast part of the percentage increase reflected the fact that thisJanuary's sales were being compared to last year's fairly anemicamounts.   Analysts expressed optimism about the retailers' earnings for thefourth quarter of their fiscal year, which for many of them endedJanuary 28. The financial results are due out later this month.   Among the major retailers reporting Thursday, the nation'slargest, Sears, Roebuck and Co., said its overall sales rose 11.4percent in January and 7.3 percent for its entire fiscal year. Itssame-store sales were up 6.2 percent for the month and 3.4 percentover the course of the year.   K mart Corp. said its overall sales rose 6.9 percent in Januaryand 6.5 percent over the year. Its same-store sales rose 2.5 percentlast month and 2.8 percent for the full year.   Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s overall sales rose 30 percent last monthand 29 percent for the year. The discount retailer's same-storesales rose 13 percent in January and 12 percent for the year.   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. posted a 2.4 percent gain for January and adecline of 0.1 percent over the year. The company's same-store salesrose 0.2 percent last month while falling 1.8 percent for the year.   The decline in Penney's sales occurred in part because thecompany discontinued several merchandise lines over the past year.   Dayton Hudson Corp., a big department store owner, reported a15.2 percent overall sales gain in January and a 14.4 percent risefor the full year. Its same-store stores rose 9.4 percent in themonth and 3.1 percent in the year.   May Department Stores Co.'s January sales rose 25.8 percent andfull-year sales rose 18.9 percent. Same-store sales rose 7.6 percentlast month and 3.7 percent last year.   F.W. Woolworth Co. said its overall sales increased 12.2 percentin January and 12.3 percent in the 12 months. Same-store sales rose6 percent in the month and 6.4 percent in the year.   Montgomery Ward andamp; Co. reported an 8.3 percent January salesincrease and a 4.6 percent rise for the year. It did not providesame-store sales figures.   Despite strong results in December and January, many stores wereunable to keep place with inflation during the year. For all of1988, inflation grew at a rate of 4.4. percent.   The results reported were from the biggest general merchandiseand apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retail sales figures releasedby the federal government, they do not include sales at autodealers, supermarkets or restaurants.</TEXT></DOC>
