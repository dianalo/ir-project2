The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended 1/2 pointlower, a loss of $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. Theissue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of itsprice, rose to 8.96% from 8.91% on Friday.</LP><TEXT>   Tax-exempt municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securitiesfollowed the Treasury market step-by-step.   But junk bonds, ignoring the declines in the Treasury andstock markets, posted gains of between 1/4 and 1/2 points.   &quot;Junk bonds moved up early with equities and somehow heldon to those advances despite a late-day sell off in the stockmarket,&quot; said John Lonski, senior economist at Moody'sInvestors Service Inc. He said the gains were exaggerated bythe extremely thin trading conditions.   &quot;I would not read too much in the way of substance,&quot; intothe junk bond rally, said Mr. Lonski. If oil prices remainabove $30 a barrel when the market opens today, he said, junkbond prices are likely to fall.   The broader bond market also opened higher yesterday. Butprices of Treasurys, municipals, investment-grade corporatesand many other fixed-income securities reversed directions ondisappointment that the Federal Reserve did not pushshort-term interest rates lower and on talk that budgetnegotiations have stalled.   The talks are moving so slowly that President Bushcanceled a planned meeting yesterday morning with the budgetnegotiators. Prior to that announcement, Treasury SecretaryNicholas Brady commented on ABC-TV that the budget talks &quot;aregoing nowhere fast.&quot;   John Costas, co-head of government trading at First BostonCorp., said investors reacted negatively to the news becausewithout a budget accord, the government will continue toborrow heavily in the credit markets to finance its spendinghabits.   Some economists argue that the government's immenseborrowing needs are keeping interest rates relatively high.Moreover, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said on numerousoccasions that he would cut interest rates if Congress andthe Administration significantly reduced the budget deficit.   Without some agreement to reduce the deficit or alter theGramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, about $85 billion inacross-the-board spending cuts will be triggered Oct. 1.   Mr. Costas said news about the budget negotiations anddisappointment that the Fed failed to ease short-term rates&quot;softened up the market.&quot; But, he added, &quot;the marketdeterioration accelerated after the oil price increase.&quot;   October crude oil futures settled at $31.30 a barrel, up$1.26 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   Bond prices have been falling for weeks due to fears thatrising oil prices, a trend that was precipitated by Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait, will accelerate inflation. Rising pricesgreatly reduce the appeal and attraction of fixed-incomesecurities.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Short-term interest rates were mixed at yesterday's weeklygovernment Treasury bill auction.   The average discount rate on three-month bills was 7.41%and the average rate on six-month bills was 7.34%. The rateon three-month bills was up from last week's auction when itwas 7.39%. But the rate on six-month bills was down from theprevious auction when it was 7.36%.   Here are details of yesterday's auction:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it. Thepercentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while thecoupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                                                                                                                          13-Week         26-Week                                                                                                        Applications ...........  $29,472,955,000 $27,732,980,000 Accepted bids ..........   $9,200,080,000  $9,233,440,000 Accepted at low price ..              51%             46% Accepted noncompet'ly ..   $1,540,195,000  $1,322,955,000 Average price (Rate) ...   98.127 (7.41%)  96.289 (7.34%) High price (Rate) ......   98.135 (7.38%)  96.294 (7.33%) Low price (Rate) .......   98.127 (7.41%)  96.289 (7.34%) Coupon equivalent ......            7.66%           7.73%                                                                                                          Both issues are dated Sept. 13, 1990.
