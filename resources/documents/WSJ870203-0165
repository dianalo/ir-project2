Naples, 41-year-old vice chairman, president and chief executive officer, is expected to succeed George E. Bartol III as chairman when Mr. Bartol retires from that post in April.    The maker of arts supplies, office products and computer systems furniture said Mr. Bartol, 65, will remain a director.    The move will complete a management transition begun in 1981 when Mr. Naples was named to succeed Mr. Bartol as chief executive, a position Mr. Naples will continue to hold.    The company said it expects Robert B. Fritsch, executive vice president and chief operating officer, to succeed Mr. Naples as president. Mr. Fritsch, 55, will continue as chief operating officer and will stand for election to the board at the annual meeting April 22.    Hunt said the positions of vice chairman and executive vice president will be filled if required, but a spokesman said successors haven't been selected. </TEXT></DOC>
