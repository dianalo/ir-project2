In a wide-ranging news conference, Yuan Mu also denounced dissentwithin China. He said a battle to improve the economy is showingresults.   Asked about recent campaigns by Chinese intellectuals calling fordemocratic reforms and the release of political prisoners, Yuansaid, ``We are not happy with this situation.''   China's constitution, Yuan said, guarantees freedom of speech,``but no one is allowed to infringe upon the interests of the state,society and other citizens.''   He said some critics of the government, whom he did not name,were denying the basic tenets of Marxism and rule of the CommunistParty and ``relying on foreign forces'' to spread their message.   ``This is something we are not in favor of,'' he said. ``Chinahas no intention to import from Western political systems thingswhich are not in keeping with reality in China.''   Yuan denied China has any political prisoners.   China showed its displeasure with political activism bypreventing astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, the nation's best knowndissident, from attending a banquet held by President Bush duringBush's visit last month.   Asked about Tibet, where dozens of people have died inanti-Chinese riots since 1987 _ including 16 people killed last week_ Yuan said ``conflicts arise'' there because ``some separatistswant to split Tibet from the motherland, and we won't allow that.''   ``The channel for dialogue is always open'' with Tibet's exiledspiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, Yuan said.   The Dalai Lama has agreed to talk to the Chinese, but Chinarejects his proposals to give Tibet greater regional autonomy.   Yuan said China's six-month effort to reduce an inflation rateofficially set at 26 percent has had some success, although``further efforts will be faced with great difficulties.''   He also said government reassertion of controls over many aspectsof the economy is not a setback for the 10-year-old policies ofmarket-oriented reforms.   ``While enlivening the economy, chaos can't appear,'' he said.``Good order must be maintained while invigorating enterprises.''   Saving deposits are on the rise, the momentum of price rises hasleveled off since the beginning of the year and industrial growththrough February has been held to a manageable 8 percent, less thanhalf the overheated rate of the past year, he said.   Yuan said further reforms in the nation's heavily subsidizedprice system, deemed crucial to increased productivity and economicefficiency, will slow this year because of the inflation problem.   Asked if the government would meet its goal of substantiallylowering inflation this year, Yuan said it will be ``verydifficult.... That remains to be seen.''</TEXT></DOC>
