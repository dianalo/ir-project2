White (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT HMC LABOR </CO><IN> AUT </IN><TEXT>   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. has agreed to give 370 blacks and women a total of $6 million in back pay, resolving a federal discrimination complaint.    The recipients of the award had unsuccessfully applied for jobs at Honda between 1983 and 1986; the investigation of the Ohio auto maker's hiring practices began in September 1984. The agreement, signed Tuesday but under discussion for some time, also stipulated that all back-pay recipients be offered a job by Feb. 29.    Under terms of the agreement, the EEOC was barred from describing the conditions or circumstances that led to the complaint and the settlement, officials said. An EEOC spokeswoman said even the wording of the announcement was negotiated in the settlement.    While Honda admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement, the EEOC action puts a spotlight on sensitive questions about the hiring practices of Honda.    Not only did Honda locate its U.S. auto, engine and motorcycle facilities in two rural, mostly white central Ohio communities, but until September 1987, Honda favored job applicants who lived 30 miles or less from its facilities. That tended to exclude the black residents of Columbus, Ohio, the nearest big city.    In September 1987, Honda announced a major expansion of its Ohio operations, and expanded its hiring area to include Columbus. However, Honda had more than 30,000 applications already on file when it announced that expansion, a company spokesman said yesterday in Marysville, Ohio.    Currently, only 2.8% of Honda's 5,900-employee Ohio work force is black. About 26% of Honda's U.S. factory workers are women -- a ratio much higher than found in most U.S. auto plants.    &quot;We don't feel our practices have been discriminatory,&quot; the spokesman said. Honda agreed to the payments &quot;to bring this to a close.&quot;    The company, which has plants near Marysville, Ohio, and in Anna, Ohio, further agreed to expand its recruitment area to cover Columbus, Ohio, which is near Marysville; to make specific recruitment efforts for blacks; to change promotional procedures and make a commitment to hire additional black and female production workers; to inform managers about anti-discrimination laws; and to submit to EEOC monitoring for five years, to ensure compliance with the agreement.    EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas said in a statement: &quot;The five-year agreement resolves an investigation of systemic discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&quot; The EEOC was created by the act to enforce provisions against job discrimination, and laws barring discrimination against the elderly and disabled.    Al Kinzer, vice president and senior manager of administration at Honda, said in a statement: &quot;Honda of America is known for its commitment to personal growth and development. Honda's participation in this agreement underscores our continuing commitment to these principles.&quot;    This was the second agreement with Honda of America, a unit of Honda Motor Co. of Japan, involving the Ohio plants. In June 1987, the commission announced an agreement on an age-discrimination complaint that provided back pay totaling $461,610. The agreement also required jobs and seniority adjustments for 85 individuals age 40 and over who had unsuccessfully applied for jobs at Honda in 1984 and 1985.    The company recently announced a $561 million expansion of its U.S. manufacturing operations, including construction of a second auto-assembly plant near Marysville. </TEXT></DOC>
