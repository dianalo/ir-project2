The two regulators whose votes delayed the seizure for a yearsay they did not know at the time that the accountant, Jack D.Atchison, had taken the new job _ said by one member of Congress topay $900,000 annually.   But in recent statements, former Federal Home Loan Bank Boardchairman M. Danny Wall and board member Roger F. Martin said theirdecision concerning the fate of Lincoln _ the nation's costliestthrift failure _ might have been different if they had beeninformed.   ``Certainly, it would have had an effect on the decision had heknown,'' said Karl Hoyle, an aide to Wall. ``Could it have swungthe other way (in favor of immediate seizure)? Maybe.''   Attempts to reach Atchison for comment proved futile. His lawyeralso declined to discuss the matter, first reported by The ArizonaRepublic, and said that Atchison would not talk about it withreporters.   By a 2-1 vote on May 5, 1988, the three-member bank boarddecided against a recommendation from San Francisco regulators toseize the troubled savings and loan. The group decided instead tolaunch a new federal examination of the thrift's books. The effectof the decision was to permit the bank to continue operating for anadditional year under the ownership of Charles H. Keating Jr.   By the time the regulators ousted Keating and took control onApril 14, 1989, the cost of protecting depositors had soared, andmay now total more than $2 billion.   Wall earlier this month resigned as head of the bank board'ssingle-administrator agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision,under pressure from Congress because of his handling of the Lincolncase. He remains in the job until a successor is named.   The delay in seizing Lincoln generated a barrage of news storiesabout Keating, especially the $1.3 million he and associatescontributed to campaigns and causes of five senators who intervenedwith the regulators on his behalf.   The Senate Ethics Committee has begun a formal investigation todetermine whether the intervention was linked to the money. All thesenators have denied any wrongdoing.   Since 1986, favorable audit reports on Lincoln had been writtenby Atchison, who was managing partner in the Phoenix office of thelarge accounting firm of Arthur Young _ now Ernst andamp; Young.   Bradley Boland, Keating's spokesman, said Atchison began workingfor Lincoln's parent firm _ American Continental Corp. of Phoenix _on May 2, 1988, three days before the crucial meeting of the bankboard. House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,said Atchison's salary with American Continental was $900,000 ayear.   An Arthur Young memo confirmed the timing of the job change,saying that Atchison ``decided to accept a position with AmericanContinental Corp. effective May 1, 1988.''   Last Nov. 7, Atchison refused to answer questions beforeGonzalez' committee, claiming a Fifth Amendment constitutionalright against self-incrimination.   At the time Atchison switched jobs, the San Francisco-basedregulators were telling the bank board that Lincoln was in suchserious trouble that it should be taken over by the government.   But Atchison's audits, according to a transcript of the bankboard's May 5, 1988 meeting, concluded that the thrift had enoughreserves to cover losses and had met net worth requirements.   Faced with the differing opinions, the bank board conducted its2-1 vote to freeze Lincoln's level of investments, transfer thebank board investigation from San Franciso to Washington and begina new probe of the Irvine, Calif. thrift.   Wall and Martin voted in the majority, while board memberLawrence J. White constituted a single-vote minority who favoredimmediate government seizure.   Martin said in an interview that he didn't know that Atchisonhad gone to work for American Continental three days before themeeting. He said he ``would have been concerned'' had he known, and``absolutely'' would have raised questions about the impartialityof the audits.   ``We were were very dependent on the accountant's opinion,'' hesaid.   Wall spokesman Hoyle said his boss ``did not have anyknowledge'' of the job change.   ``At a minimum, he would have wanted to go back and check withArthur Young,'' Hoyle said. ``No doubt we would have looked atthings differently, because it would have made the data suspect.It's a significant factor if you knew perhaps these numbers weretainted.''   D. Jeffrey Hirschberg, associate general counsel for Ernst andamp;Young, said, ``We clearly have no evidence (Atchison) committed anyimpropriety when he was a partner at Arthur Young.''   ``We have partners that leave all the time for better-payingjobs in industry,'' he said. ``It's not unusual. Just because Jackleft does not mean the audit was improper.''</TEXT></DOC>
