 The fact that thePC User &quot;Fastest PC on Six Legs&quot; charity race was such a success and managedto raise so much money is attributable to the spirit, enthusiasm andgenerosity with which computer companies throughout the UK greeted the idea.andM;The response to the race was quite surprising, really.andP;  Many companies mightsimply have opted to give us the money (S,500 per team - petty cash money formost computer companies) and not bothered entering the race.andP;  After afl, manydonate money to charity on a regular basis anyway.andP;  What was surprising wasthe amount of time and effort that the various companies were prepared to putin to make a success of a charitable event.andP;  Because of that effort we cannow make the race an annual occasion, and plan to introduce a similar trialfor the software industry; what could have been a one-off appeal can nowbecome an on-going fund generating event.andM;However, the 26 companies that turned up at Verulamium Park in St. Alban's onSaturday 13 May had shorter term goals in mind.andP;  They were there for GreatOrmond Street, for the PR and for the crack.andP;  When you find IBM, Compaq,Olivetti, Dell, Acer, Apricot, Toshiba, Unisys, Victor, Amstrad, Everex,Tulip, AST, Tandon, Golden Gate, Arche, HM Systems, Zenith and SCO afl in onespot clapping, cheering and jeering one another, you realise there are moreimportant things in this life than computers.andM;Arche donated a PC to Great Ormond Street.andP;  Coming from near Sherwood Forestin Nottingham, they and their supporters turned up dressed as Robin Hood andhis merry men.andM;The three IBM athletes  afl bona-fide employees) who won the race, afl turnedin times under five minutes.andP;  Olivetti's engineers reportedly halted afl EISAdevelopment work for three weeks to construct a sedan contraption in which tocarry their M250.andP;  The girls from Acer, determined to buy everyone a drink,walked around the course to ensure they'd come last.andM;it afl goes to show, once again, that the staff are the most important partof any company and that, with the right attitude, computer companies can begood corporate citizens.andP;  It also made for good publicity.andM;Of course, some people wouldn't recognise a photo opportunity if it came upand snapped them in the face.andM;@@@073519863 0PCUHVY039LLTTandM;Amid the furore surrounding the compression bug in PC tools v5.1, I amsurprised that nobody seems to have noticed another bug - I'm referring tothe HP 1 2C financial calculator implementation.andM;I am a long-standing user of the HP I 2C and its inclusion in PC Tools wasthe main reason for purchasing the program.andM;However, I find that it trips up on a relatively simple percentagecalculation; suppose you want to find the monthly interest payable on aS,30,000 mortgage at 10 per cent nominal rate per annum: the key sequence is30000 followed by Enter 10 % 1 2/.andP;  PC tools gets I 0 per cent of 30000 okay,but as soon as the I of 12 is pressed the X register shows 30 1 00 instead ofmoving the 30900 up the stack and showing 1.andP;  When the 2 is pressed the Xregister shows 301200!andM;All its other facilities are clever and techni- cally impressive but, so faras I am concerned,andM;I've wasted      mon .andM;The article  Restoring Standards, IBM PS2 DC2000 DAT Drive'  Issue 104) hadme confused.andM;As far as I can see, it has nothing whatever to do with Digital Audio Tape(DAT), but is a back-up system based on the DC2000 tape cartridge.andP;  If so,why the confusing reference to DAT?andM;The HP/Sony DDS back-up system is based on R-DAT (Rotary Head Digital AudioTape) and there is an alternative philosophy based on R-DAT being promoted bya group of manufacturers - one of which includes Hitachi.andP;  The distinctionbetween R-DAT and other cassette formats like DC2000 is an important one andshould not be blurred.andP;  Although I normally read PC User from cover to coverand generally feel that information has been presented in a professional,informative and unbiased way - or at least an indication is given where anindividual may have a vested interest in any comments that may be made - Iwas somewhat surprised to read'Front-End' (Issue 105).andM;In his article, Ross Mcbeath states that &quot;In many companies, a sensiblepolicy will be to establish long term relationshipswith hardware, softwareand training suppliers to provide the product support and training servicesthat are an essential element of successful microcomputer use.andP;  &quot; I do notdisagree with this comment as I am sure there are many companies withouttheir own internal PC support teams, however, I don't believe that such acomment should be published in PC User under the heading'Users get theirsay'.andP;  Why?andM;Ross Mcbeath just happens to be a director of a company (SMM CommunicationsLtd) that provides just those services he is advocating end users to take up,a vested interest if ever there was one!andM;Perhaps Ross would like us all to take out one of their new PICS agreements(Phone in Consultancy Service) at a cost of 1000 [pounds] S,6000 per annumper site? No thank you; and PC User, please attribute comments to authorswith the appropriate health warnings?andM;We read with sadness your article on remote controls for the PC GraphicsPackages.andP;  We say sadness, as you didn't even hint that PenSwitch existed!andM;PenSwitch was the first Remote control for PC based Graphics Packages, it hasbeen selling well in the UK and Europe for about two years now - quite awhile before the others.andM;It is not inframed, as Performance Technologies want the presenter's audienceto watch the presentation and not the presenter NA-ax-ing his remote controlabout in the air.andP;  unless of course the presenter wants to sax.andP;  Look at aflthe high-tech I've got!&quot; Penswitch can  be used discreetly.andP;  Witness the TVweatherman.andM;PenSwitch.andP;  at  79.95[pounds] is less than half the cost of its cleapestcompetitor.andP;  We need not mention what the other one costs.andM;@@@073520225 0PCUHvy042OIABandM;Third time lucky must be IBMS' current philosophy.andP;  The new PS/2 Model P70 isits third attempt at the portables market, it already has MCA and a 20 MHz80386 but, as the saying goes, is it too little too late?andM;Also launched is the PS/2 Model 55, IBMs first 386SX machine.andP;  In this issuewe: 0 Review the PS/2 Model P70 40 Look at the portables market; what do theusers think of the new machine?andM;A review of the PS/2 Model 5 5  D Plus a look at how the new machines fitinto the PS/2 range lanes, trains and automobiles.andP;  They're afl places whereyou wouldn't use IBM's new portable.andP;  After two false starts and months ofdeliberation with Mark III, IBM has decided to leave that market to thefight-weight, battery-powered laptops and concentrateandM;on     competing      with      otherandM;transportables and with desktop machines - primarily its own, it seems.andM;As a mains-powered 201b machine with a 20MHz 80386 processor, 16shades-of-amber on an 11-inch VGA screen, 4Mb of memory expandable to 16Mb,either a 60 or 120Mb hard disk, Micro Channel Architecture and 3 MCA slots,IBM's main pitch for the P70 is as a straight replacement for a desktop Model70.andM;&quot;It's briefcase-sized, but other than that it's a fully functioning Model 70with no compro- mises,&quot; said IBM's manager of personal systems productmanagement, David McAutly.andP;  &quot;What you do is run it in the office as a fullyfunctional machine and then at the end of the day chip it up and take ithome.&quot;andM;The transportable format and 386 processor means IBM will be trying to elbowits way into a market dominated by Toshiba's 5200 (66.6 per cent market shareas of March  89) and Compaq's Portable 386 (31.7 per cent share).andP;  But thequestion is, by taking so long to launch a machine, how much harder has IBMmade the task of stealing away any share of the spoils?andM;According to IBM dealers, there were rumours of internal rejection of thedesign over past months.andP;  What's more, certain dealers who claimed to haveseen prototypes of the machine last year, now say that the final launchdesign is in no way dramatically different.andM;&quot;It would have been innovative when it was first due to ship, but now IBM isgoing to have to go for price competitiveness not innova- tion,&quot; said onesource.andM;With the pricing it actually set, IBM acknowledged a need to be aggressivelycompetitive, but hasn't broken any barriers.andP;  At S,5,819 for the 120Mb unit,as compared to 5,895[pounds] for Compaq's 100Mb unit and S6,395 for Toshiba's100Mb 5200, IBM is undercutting.andP;  But its 60Mb unit is 600[pounds] more thanCompaq's nearest, 40Mb equivalent.andM;&quot;Clearly we look at the comparative prices and if you take function forfunction and hard file for hard file, I think we are very competitive at thisprice-point in the market,&quot; said McAutry.andP;  Both dealers and rivals seem toagree.andP;  &quot;The pricing is aggressive,&quot; admitted a spokeswoman for Toshiba.andP;  Theview was echoed by Compaq's marketing director Peter Bailey, but he added,&quot;we won't be drawn into comparing our prices for established readilyavailable products, with announced specifications that are not shipping inquantity.andP;  We'll wait until they're on the shelves.&quot;andM;Dealers also appreciated the keen pricing.andP;  &quot;It shows that IBM is committedto competing with AT-standard manufacturers on price, despite having superiortechnology.andP;  It should give IBM an edge,&quot; said David Smith, MD of IBM dealerWorldwide Computers,andM;&quot;The key to die P70 is the design point we've taken, &quot; said McAutry.andO;&quot;Without compromise - which has been the problem with most portables in thepast - we've taken the full func- don of one of the most powerful desktopsand packaged it so you can just clip it up and take it home.andP;  A 120Mb, 20MHzmachine that you can do that with represents, we think, a rela- tively newdeparture in the marketplace.andP;  &quot;andM;But Toshiba, Compaq and existing customers of both, disagree.andP;  &quot;You could sayexactly the same for Compaq's 386,&quot; claimed Norman Beesley, another PCevaluator for the same London Insurance company, who lists Compaq Portable386s as the approved transportable.andP;  &quot;You could say exactly that with theToshiba 5200,&quot; echoes Pam Kay, in computer services at one of the to fiveaccountants.andM;To support its claims, however, IBM highlighted compatibility and capacity asthe qualities that will put it a step ahead.andP;  &quot;This isn't just functionallysimilar to a Model 70 - to all intents and purposes it is a Model 70,&quot; saidMcAutry.andP;  He claims that the keyboard is an absolutely standard enhancedkeyboard with trimmed edges.andM;Along the same lines, McAutty claimed the 16 grey scale VGA monitor meantthat, &quot;You could take a full OS/2 Extended Edition application withPresentation Manager and comms that runs on a Model 70, move it to a P70, andit win run perfectly.&quot; Emphasizing the point McAutry added that, IBM winlater announce a version of AIX to run on both Model 70 and P70 that willtake advantage of the full 32-bit architecture.andM;&quot;This isn't going to be a machine that's bought and then discarded in 18months time.andP;  We expect that more and more sophisticated applications willrun on it as time goes by,&quot; McAutry added.andM;Central to that is the room for growth that's been built into the machine,IBM claims.andP;  A point that McAutry claims will be important once OS/2 comesin, is that you can take up to 8Mb of RAM on the system board, and so withoutusing up a slot.andP;  &quot;It means you can run DOS with LIM 4.0 today, you can moveto OS/2 standard edition, upgrade to extended edition or AIX, and if youreally need thumping memory you've stiff got a lot spare to take you up tothe maximum 16Mb,&quot; McAutry added.andM;Users agree that this level of compatibility between in-house and portablecomputers is important.andP;  &quot;It seemed to be a really good idea to buy just onetransportable to replace desktops partnered with laptops, but we tried itwith Toshiba 5200s and it was a total disas- ter,&quot; said one user supportmanager in a top accountants firm.andM;&quot;It was because of the screens mostly.andP;  if you're going to be working at a PCafl day you need a full sized screen.andP;  &quot; But he conceded that &quot;the ability toplug in a standard colour VGA monitor for the office is an advantage.&quot;andM;Other users argued that compatibility with desktops is far more importantwith a battery powered laptop that is going to be a secondary computer.andP;  &quot;Insome cases, if you use a transportable aU the time, you don't need that muchcompatibility with desktops; and 9 you only have an EGA screen forspreadsheets and word processing, you can live with it because you're notcomparing it with a desktop colour VGA screen every day, &quot; said Andy Birch, afinancial controler with a leading confectioner.andM;&quot;Where     compatibility    does      becomeandM;important for a transportable that's used as a desktop, is if you need toconnect to a Lan or mainframe,&quot; said Tony Martin, a partner with MarshallFinancial Management.&quot; We have a file server and a five terminal network.andO;Our only 386 is the file server and obviously it wouldn't make sense toreplace that with a transportable.andP;  But it would make a lot of sense to usetransportables on the network as long as you could connect and disconnecteasily.&quot; But he adds, &quot;Even then, you've got to download files from theserver to take diem away, and you certainly don't need even 60Mb of storage,never mind 120Mb.andP;  &quot;andM;Leaving the last two reservations aside, McAutry believes this latter set-upis where the P70 is aimed.andP;  Another key element of the design point wasconnectivity, he explained.andM;&quot;It's possible to put an IBM Token Ring or 3270 card in one slot and hookinto a LAN session in the office, as with any other Model 70.andP;  Then at theend of the day you undo the co-ax and take the machine home.andP;  If you thenhappen to have a multifunction card in there, and you're running SDLC fromhome, you could get home and plug straight back into the host.&quot;andM;One design decision that portable users unanimously favoured was IBM'sdecision to make it a take-away desktop, not a traveling laptop, and designedit with that in mind.andP;  IBM has included features such as an auto-sensingpower supply to allow it to be used by the international traveller, but ithas done nothing to compromise power, in order to try to partially meet bothmarkets.andM;The person buying it as his main machine is IBM's prime target user, &quot;Theamount of power we're offering those users is the same as the customer islikely to have in his own office; which we see as a key attraction,&quot; saidMcAutry.andP;  &quot;But they're not going to be used in airports and planes.andP;  &quot;andM;But that's a point that  portable' users seem to be divided on.andP;  They fad tosee the point of a portable that's not truly portable.andM;If it hasn't got a battery it's not really portable.andP;  Even if you're in anoffice where there are power sockets it's often convenient not to have to usethem.andP;  Three to four hours power is usually enough,&quot; argued Tony Martin.andM;&quot;Our auditors want power because wherever they go there'll always be a plug,and our management consultants want portability because the visits areusually shorter and battery power is more convenient,&quot; claimed Pam Kay.andP;  Sheadded, &quot;We probably use transportables more than laptops but we wouldn't buya P70 to replace desktop PS/2s because they're not cheap.&quot;andM;&quot;I'd say that it's more important to be able to bundle up a desktop machineand be able to take it home, than to take it on a plane,&quot; said Larry Brooks.andO;&quot;I'm far more interested in the compatibility and robustness than in a lightweight, but it depends on how you operate.&quot;andM;The potential of the two sides of the market is a point both Toshiba andCompaq are divided on.andP;  Although many Compaq dealers claim the laptop SLT isnow outselling the Portable 386, Compaq declined to confirm this.andP;  &quot;Werecognize potential in the battery market, but we're still very confident ofstrong growth in transportables,&quot; said Bailey.andM;Initial reaction suggests IBM's product is not something users have beenclamouring for.andP;  There seems to be little magic in the configuration equationto ensure a successful late entry against Compaq and Toshiba.andM;@@@073522503 0PCUHvy044LOMOandM;Almost a year after its launch, the 386SX has finally been legitimized byIBM.andP;  This is the final credential needed to begin the revolution in low cost32-bit computing.andP;  Nervous corporates can now get their SXs from IBM, orelsewhere, secure in the knowledge that the 16-bit version of the 386 has theBig Blue stamp of approval.andM;Why the wait? Companies with much smaller Randamp;D resources made the leap sometime ago.andP;  One theory holds that IBM was punishing Compaq first with the SXin its elegant, if expensive, Deskpro 386s) by withholding its recognition ofthe chip.andP;  Few people doubt that SX sales could have been higher if IBM hadjoined the fray at the outset.andP;  Another guess is that there were technicalproblems.andP;  While the internal bits and pieces of an SX are fairlystraightforward, the Model 5 5 does have a new chip set that, like Amstrad's,may have taken more sorting out than was previously believed.andM;The most likely reason, however, was tim- ing.andP;  IBM has a particularlyobscure sense of appropriateness.andP;  Perhaps there was a desire not to cloudthe MCA waters with a new processor, or it was a sales-triggered strategy, orsimply Jim Cannavino getting out of bed one morning and saying, &quot;Let's doit.&quot;andM;The SX has often been billed as a 386 at AT prices; every time that homily isquoted, some PC maker cranks out a full specification 386 for less thanCompaq's SX-powered 386s, or another maker chops a chunk out of its 286price.andP;  The Model 55 won't do much to redress the AT price issue in the nearfuture.andM;The top end Model 55 SX-X61 with keyboard and colour VGA carries a list priceof 3,500[pounds].andP;  This is actually a  sharp price in comparison to theCompaq 386s, which has a smaller hard disk  40Mb vs IBM's 60Mb), less RAM(1Mb compared with 2Mb), and lists for S,3,540.andP;  Of course, the Compaqdoesn't have the MCA bus either, which, depending on who's talking, is a goodor bad thing.andM;Better comparisons are possible with Apricot and Olivetti MCAware.andP;  AnApricot Qi 350i with a 50Mb hard disk, 2Mb of RAM and colour VGA costsS,3,595.andP;  Don't forget that this includes an Ethernet adaptor, abisynchronous comms port and a lot more security than a case lock.andP;  Next tothe Qi, the Model 5 5 looks under- featured and over-priced.andM;Olivetti's P500 with 2Mb of RAM, an 80Mb hard disk and VGA colour costsS,4,226.andP;  I suspect that there may be a forthcoming change in price for theOlivetti machine.andM;In the race to AT price compatibility, Tulip reveals how far the Model 55 hasto go.andP;  A 40 Mb/1Mb/colour SX Compact 2 can be had for less than2,800[pounds] - that's just about the price of the Model 55 system unitalone.andP;  IBM, with its mechanized production (and a rumoured materials cost ofless than $200) can do just about anything it wants with the Model 55'sprice, including dropping it to the $1,500 price tag mentioned by Bill Lowebefore he retired to Xerox.andP;  There is a lot of manoeuvering room between thecurrent Model 55 price and the 1,809 [pounds] list price (which nobody pays)of the Model 30 286.andM;The availability of the Model 60 has been restricted for some time, whichmeans if they can find one that has been overlooked in the warehouse, you canhave it.andP;  IBM's cupboards are bare of light-duty file servers at the moment(please hold your unkind comments about the Model 80).andM;What about the Model 65? A small network or multi-user system depends less onbrute processor power than on big and fast mass storage.andP;  Leaving aside thechronic lack of hard file performance which characterizes the IBM line-up,the hypothesized Model 65 would be a natural adjunct to the PS/2 range.andO;Perhaps when we see the autumn fashion range there will be  towering'announcements.andP;  Has IBM, wittingly or unwittingly, killed off the Model 50?andO;Coinciding with the launch of die 55, IBM moved the 50Z's system unit(rumoured to be the most popular PS/2) down a notch in price to S,2,557.andO;That's exactly the same price as the Model 55-X31.andP;  Since the 5OZ has only1Mb of RAM, this puts it at a disadvantage to the newer, SX version of theModel 55.andM;There have been many complaints from dealers and big time PS,/2 buyers aboutthe availability of the machine.andP;  IBM has tried to explain this as theunavoidable consequence of unexpected success.andP;  I smell a phase-out of 286MCA boxes.andP;  If you want a 286, IBM will shift you an ISA box at a very goodprice, but corporate computing 1990-style requires a 386 of some description,as well as MCA.andP;  Adios, Model 5O.andM;The poor P70 has had a very hard time getting out of the door.andP;  When I talkedto a Blue minion at the PC User Show about the poor quality of the screen, hesaid that die ones he had seen since last August were much better than theone I had to review.andP;  This means that the screen may be improved, but thatthe P70 has been on the back burner for almost a year.andM;A year ago it would have looked fresh and exciting next to Compaq's restuffedPortable 111.andP;  The Compaq Portable 386 runs at the same 20MHz clock speed,has a gas-plasma screen, does without a RAM cache too, has a 20Mb smallerhard disk 100 or 40 vs 120 or 60 from IBM), has less RAM as standard andcosts from about 500 pounds less (for the 40Mb Portable 386) to 200 poundsmore (for the big disk version).andP;  Money-wise, the IBM has the edgeconsidering the 4Mb RAM standard equipment.andM;Toshiba is well-known for its computers with handles, and it too has a 20MHz386 with two slots, a gas-plasma screen and 40 and 100Mb hard disks.andP;  Inaddition, the Toshiba T5200 has an 82385 cache controller and 32Kb of staticRAM to make processor operations a zero wait-state proposition.andP;  The smallerT 200 runs out the door at S,5 495, while the 100Mb version costs abreathtaking 6,395 pounds.andP;  Once again, neither of these machines has 4Mb ofRAM as standard, and they cost a lot more.andP;  Battery-powered portable 386s arenoticeably thin on the ground.andP;  Disregarding the quirky Grid offering, onlyZenith with its TurbosPORT 386, is in the game.andP;  If you fancy mains-freeexistence, a 2Mb RAM ration and a 40Mb hard disk, the Zenith will cost aboutS,5,300 if you add the three-slot external box.andP;  This is very competitivewith the smaller P70 offering.andM;The rice atvantage of the P70 will turn a few heads.andP;  But its year-oldtechnology win pale in comparison to Mission latest offering.andM;Mission will be launching its ProPortable as an office away from the office.andO;Designed by Porsche, it will include a built-in NLQ inkjet printer, fax andmodem comms, network connections, optical storage, and security in the same20lb leather briefcase.andP;  The security issue is an important one; if you cancarry around your year's accounts or planning budgets, you don't want toleave that information accessible to anyone who knows what a C:drive is for.andM;Do portables need slots? Although the Mission box will have two MCA slotslike the P70, I'm not convinced that they're a good idea.andM;The pitch at the time was for SMT, but die concept is transferable.andP;  Fewwould doubt that a portable will suffer more abuse than a desktop PC.andP;  Soit's essential that of a portable's innards be of a different, higher order.andO;This starts by building network and comms functions onto the motherboardinstead of sticking them in the expansion bus.andM;Although silicon lovers will enjoy the P70's crisp gas-plasma screen, we'reperhaps just a few months away from colour LCDS.andP;  The P70 display will be oldhat when the colour bandwagon gets rolling.andM;The P70 lacks  pizzazz', but perhaps I don't appreciate its charms.andP;  At thelaunch IBM stead- fastly refused to be pinned down about the availability ofthe P70, aside from one-perdealer demo quantities.andP;  With afl die priceadvantage and IBM cachet in the world, if you can't buy one and you need one,you'll go shopping at the Compaq or Toshiba store.andM;@@@073526320 0PCUHVY049SAHRandM;A year or so ago, Bill Lowe, of IBM's entry-systems division, was soundingoff about $1,500 386 machines.andP;  The concept is as interesting today as it wasthen especially since IBM has now shown us the machine that it's going to useto bring 32-bit computing to die masses.andM;As we move into the 1990s 386 compatibility is essential to software.andP;  Withthe 386's natural ability to run several virtual 8086 machines,  limited onlyby the amount of RAM) the pressure for OS/2 software win abate as will thedisappointment at its late arrival.andP;  Virtual 8086 DOS software will notreplace die multi-threading OS/2 applications but it will give us a leapforward in utility  while the cooks are still stirring the broath.andM;Demand-page memory will a how RAM efficiency to ease the pressure that memoryputs on your hardware budget.andP;  The current 16MHz SX chip is a good thing butthe 20MHz upgrade expected before the year's end will be even better.andP;  OS/2is a 20MHz operating system.andM;The Model 55 can be seen as the entry level product for MCA Phase II where aUmachines will have 386 family processors.andP;  It's fitting, therefore, that theModel 55 is encased in the humble Model 30 low profile shell.andP;  The box isroughly 40x40x10cm and is outwardly identical to its Model 30 stablemates.andO;The front features the  Big White Switch', a 1.44Mb 3 1/2 inch floppy diskand not a lot else.andP;  ne case lock is on the right-hand side.andM;The Model 55 will be one of the first new PS/2s to enjoy extensive use ofyour library of 5 1/4-inch software on 1.2Mb disks.andP;  IBM has slid an externaldisk drive in the back door to finally take care of the old AT usersupgrading to PS/2 hardware.andM;The back of die machine reveals the standard assortment of ports.andP;  PS/2 mouseand keyboard ports are squeezed in next to one another above the fine of I/Oconnectors which includes 25-pin serial and parallel ports and the obligatoryVGA socket.andP;  There is a source for monitor power just above the system unit'smains point.andM;A glance at the rear panel shows that the Model 5 5's expansion slots arepositioned hor- izontally, as in the Model 30S.andP;  There are three 16-bit slotsaltogether, one with the video extension for the 8514A enhanced graphicsadaptor.andM;I checked compliance with previous Micro Channel practice with an assortmentof MCA adaptors, including the COREtape interface card for an external tapestreamer, Dataftex Design's MCA Biscom V22bis modem and a posse of RAMboards, including the Orchid RAMQuest 16/32, RAMQuest IIZ, and RAMQuest50/60.andP;  No problem - I couldn't fit the Interquadram Quadmaster PS/Q, though,because of mechanical interference with the external option toggle switch onthe board.andM;In the course of fitting and removing a half dozen or so adaptor cards, Irealized that this sideways method of mounting is not quite as robust as theup-and-down orientation of the Model 70.1 had trouble getting my MCA Biscomto seat properly in the upper two slots, and the difference, I suspect, isthat there is a fair amount of give farther away from the anchor on themotherboard.andP;  I doubt, though, that a user would change as many cards in theK's service lifetime as I do when checking out new kit.andM;The motherboard is just a bit larger than an outsized postcard and looksdistinctly underpopulated in comparison with the ear- ber PS/2 examples.andO;Fewer chips mean less manufacturing cost and higher reliability.andP;  SMT hasbeen used throughout, but IBM is following Apricot's practice of liberallylacing the motherboard with revision spaghetti on the Model 55.andM;Contrary to speculation, the 386SX is soldered to the motherboard next to the387SX socket.andP;  if it had been on a socketed  daughtercard itself, that wouldhave been an indication for the faster version's early appearance.andM;In case you have just arrived on the planet, the 386SX is a 32-bit 386internally, but with a 16-bit external data path instead of the normal 32-bitconnections.andP;  The whole raison d'etre of the SX is to make 386 computingcheaper.andP;  The chip itself is cheaper and the devices other parts.andM;After looking at several implementations of the SX, it's reasonable to assumethat it's just as fast when running 16-bit software as the full blown 386.andO;Running 32-bit software, of which there is comparatively little, it willinevitably be slower as it needs two fetches to get a 32-bit instruction.andM;The basic Model 55 has 2Mb of RAM expandable to 4Mb before a bus adaptor cardis required.andP;  This means that the 55 is essen- dally being marketed as a DOSmachine since there isn't much you can do with OS/2 on a 2Mb bud t.andM;But to get the Model 55 up to 4Mb bus mounted you have to remove the two 1MbSIMMs shipped with the box and buy four more.andP;  Unless you then pump up thecash for an IBM SIMM-carrying bus memory adaptor you have, in effect, paidfor 6Mb and used only 4Mb.andP;  Most other manufacturers are supporting eightsockets (and in effect, 8Mb) on the motherboard; it's senseless of IBM to cutthis corner.andM;There are two models of the 55, with hard disk capacity making the essentialdifference.andP;  The Model 55-X31 has a 30Mb unit claiming an average access timeof 39ms and a data transfer rate of 7.5Mbits per second.andP;  In the Model55-X61, the 60Mb drive achieved a 28ms average access time according to CORE.andO;IBM quotes its data transfer rate at 8.4Mbps.andP;  Both drives are 1: Iinterleave.andP;  The larger one is the same as the Model 70's and P70's.andM;IBM has created something called flexible Micro Channel to connect the Model55's hard disk-cum-embedded controller to the MCA bus daughtercard that holdsthe expansion slots.andP;  There appears to be a lot of places you can go with MCAthat you can't with ISA and perhaps one of them is around corners! To myuntutored sensibilities, it looks like a bit of fancy cable, though.andM;The machine reached my hands with DOS 4.0, so Windows 386 was a non-starter.andO;I ran the usual PC User benchmark software Wordstar, Paradox and WritersProofreader, Lotus, DBASE - and an assortment of other bits and bobs, andthere were no problems.andP;  OS/2 Extended Edition was demonstrated in a 4Mbmachine but, you must appreciate, there wasn't a lot of software to run withit.andM;Once again, I had to review a PS,/2 machine without sight of the documents.andO;I haven't seen a PS/2 hardware manual in the two years following itsintroduction so I can't even say that they would undoubtedly be as good asthe rest.andP;  As I was the first person in the UK to have a go with the Model 55, 1 can't very well blame my fight fingered brethren at another magazine,can I? Is there some problem at IBM with documents? Did someone put them onrestricted availability?andM;The Model 55 is a good machine for everyone that craves Blueware but doesn'tneed a floor stander or desktop screamer.andP;  IBM has indicated that it's readyto ship in numbers; it had better be.andM;@@@073526746 0PCUHVY051CICIandM;The IBM P70 is a high-end machine  designed to go head-to-head with theToshiba T5200, the Compaq Portable 386 and the soon to appear MissionProPort- able.andP;  It was IBM's intention to graft die Model 80 handle onto theguts of a Model 70, to provide power computing away from the office.andP;  What itgot was a Micro Channel curate's egg.andM;The P70 is made from the same plastic material as other PS/2 models.andP;  It'sthe same colour too, which is something that IBM is inordi- nately proud offor some reason.andP;  The inside surfaces have been sprayed with a conductivecoating to keep it from polluting the electromagnetic environment.andM;The back of the box has two small liding doors to protect the connectors.andO;One in the lower left-hand corner covers the mains port which can beconnected to just about any weird third world voltage you are likely toencoun- ter.andP;  Adjustment to whatever the local power company suppliesautomatic.andP;  A bigger panel on the right conceals the 25-pin serial and par-allel ports, the VGA port, an external drive connector and a PS/2 mouse port.andM;The sliding panel is in a rather redundant door that opens to give wideraccess to the assorted ports, and the back-end of the two Micro Channel slotsto be found inside.andM;The P70 weighs in at about 20lbs.andP;  This is vir- tually the same as the CompaqPortable 386 and the Zenith TurbosPORT 386.andP;  Hanging on the end of your arm,you certainly wouldn't confuse it with a Cambridge Z88 or Toshiba T1000.andM;The portability of the P70 will depend a lot on the cases that IBM hasdesigned for it.andP;  The built-in handle is only for distances under 10 feet.andO;There's a utilitarian nylon case on the price list for  28 [pounds] or, for aprincely S,238, you can get real leather.andP;  The P70 is a product of theSamsonite school of portable design.andP;  Wrapped in finest cowhide or cordura,it would be indistinguishable in a corner of the cloakroom from the standardbusiness carriers of lunches and clean shirts.andP;  It measures 3Ox46x13cm, andalthOugh it's not quite as easy to lug about as the slimmer Toshiba T5200,it's far easier to carry than the ComPaq sewing machine shape.andM;IBM got the keyboard partly right.andP;  it was spot on in specifying a full size101-key implementation like Amstrad.andP;  No fancy finger work is required to usethe number pad or editing keys.andP;  unlike the special embedded sions foundmanx.andP;  laptops.andP;  Fanciers of IBM keyboards will probably love the P70's.andP;  ithas a lighter and chicker feel than the original.andP;  Not the kind of key actionI go for at aH.andM;The keyboard is much fighter than normal desktop units, for obvious reasons.andO;The single rake adjustment is much too severe; your choice is pancake-flat orsteep incline.andP;  The anti-skid rubbers on the bottom are ineffective, leavingthe keyboard's position at the mercy of the savage coilspring cord.andP;  Aprojection on the keyboard stand will turn the power switch off When thekeyboard is attached to the systems unit.andP;  Cute.andM;Unlike most other portables, IBM has eliminated the chance of substituting adesktop keyboard.andP;  The cable is anchored to the systems unit, and theconnector at the keyboard end is incompatible with the one found on theconventional unit; this is bad design.andM;The P70 sports an internal 31 -inch floppy on a fold-down mechanism thatkeeps it safely tucked away in the bowels of the machine when on the road.andO;There is nowhere to put a second floppy, except externally.andP;  The specialdrive connector on the back services this requirement when attached to thecable dangling from a 514-inch 1.2Mb (at last!) drive.andP;  No adaptor card isrequired.andM;The hard file choice (IBM-speak for Win- chester) is limited to the samedrives found in the desktop Model 70.andP;  Both 312-inch IBMsourced drives have1:1 interleave ESDI controllers.andP;  The 60Mb unit has a claimed 27ms averageaccess time, while the 120Mb unit is purported to take only 23ms to find thedesired track.andP;  The bigger drive's transfer rate is 10Mbits per second; thesmaller drive is pegged at 8.4Mbits per second.andM;There are three screws holding the back panel in place, one on the top leftcorner and two under the bottom of the system unit.andP;  A 20 pence coin and alittle strategic tugging is all that is necessary to get at the works.andM;The motherboard in the P70 held a 20MHz 80386 and a socket for a 387 mathsco-processor.andP;  There was no 82385 cache controler or the usual patch ofstatic RAM fed by it.andM;The motherboard had quite a few straggling wires attesting to the still fluiddesign state of the P70.andP;  It looked like a slightly rearranged Model 70board, except for the plug-in video section at the top of the case and theMCA bus connector which holds the card slots and sprouts from the middle ofthe motherboard.andM;There are two MCA connectors.andP;  One adaptor card is pushed in from the top andthe other is mounted from the bottom, directly below it.andP;  The top one has a32-bit MCA connector, but the bottom one is 16-bit only.andP;  Neither slot hasthe extension necessary to accommodate the 8514A high resolution adaptor.andM;While I was able to confirm the function of the 32-bit slot with a OrchidRAMQuest Extra 16/32, an Interquadram PS 8 32-bit memory card and a 16-bitDataflex Design MCA Biscom modem, the bottom connector wouldn't acceptanything but a half-length MCA card.andM;I have never seen a half-length MCA card and I expect that you haven'teither.andP;  This means that the P70 is best regarded as a single slot machineuntil such time as one makes its debut.andP;  The single slot will have to vie fora network card in the office and a modem/fax card on the road.andM;Hot from my MCA trials with the Apricot Qi, I verified that the P70, like itsdeskbound IBM cousins, will have no truck with 16-bit memory cards; a pity,really.andP;  With memory still in the S,300 per megabyte range, I am sure thatmost users with Model 50s or 60s upgrading to a P70 or Model 70 would be gladto trade some performance for more OS/2 breathing room already bought andpaid for.andM;You are unlikely to need the slots for memory because the P70 can take eightof IBM's proprietary piggy-back  SIMMs for a motherboard total of 8Mb.andP;  Themedium expensive 85ns variety are required to yield zero to two wait states,with the standard level of equipment being a generous 4Mb.andP;  At last an IBMthat can run Presentation Manager right out of the box!andM;The P70 is fairly quiet as desktop comput- ers go, but it's not as quiet asmost portables; it's louder than the desktop Model 70.andP;  The P70 fan is notthe culprit, it's the hard disk this time.andP;  For cooling it's surrounded bywhat must be acoustically transparent louvres.andM;The 10-inch diagonal screen folds out at the bottom once the keyboard dropsdown a la Compaq.andP;  It has a 100 per cent compatible VGA gas-plasma screenwhich gives grey-scale representation of the 16 colours found on CRT VGAmonitors.andM;There's no contrast adjustment, only a brightness slider control that doesn'tgive much adjustment latitude, which means that the screen cannot cope withstrong daylight illumination.andP;  The anti-glare coating on the screen does itsjob.andM;There's no obvious way to switch between the gas-plasma screen and aconventional monitor.andP;  If the monitor is connected at boot up time, afl thevideo goes in its direction; if you hook it up after booting up, you getboth.andM;I loaded up Windows 386 and told it that it was playing to a normal VGAscreen.andP;  It worked, but I had problems telling shades apart in Reversi (I wonby my usual 2 1 points, though).andP;  I exited from Windows 386 and when I triedto get back to it, aU I got was an error message telling me I had the wrongscreen driver configured.andP;  Weird.andM;I didn't have all the time in the world but I ran WordPerfect 5.0, DBASE,Lotus, Paradox, Wordstar and a batch of utilities and benchmarks.andP;  just aboutthe only oddity was CORE, which gave the drive a rather negative access time.andO;The mouse didn't install for Windows, either, although OS/2 PresentationManager worked a treat.andM;A year ago I would have loved the P70; six months ago it would still  havebeen a very inter- ing prospect; but now I'm afraid that I'm unenthusiasticabout the P70.andP;  As a collection of bits, it's got aU the right attributes,but altogether it doesn't inspire me to reach for my cheque book.andM;The demonstrated performance doesn't compensate for the weight, and thenthere's the annoying keyboard, the useless half slot and the noise.andP;  Buyersof IBM technology will undoubtedly form lengthy, but orderly, queues to proveme wrong.andM;Try again, IBM, with a battery-powered 20MHz SX and a Sharp screen next time.andO;And take it from someone who knows, lose some weight!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
