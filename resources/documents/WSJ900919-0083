On Monday, regulators at the Resolution Trust Corp.filed papers showing that they plan to declare insolvency ofanother thrift, Franklin Savings Association, ignoring afederal court order to return it to its owners. Ourregulators, it seems, can't tell foxes from chickens, letalone sheep from goats.   To be sure, regulators suffered a decade of intimidationby the likes of Jim Wright or the five Senators upon whom Mr.Keating conferred notoriety. This climate allowed the CharleyKeatings and Donald Dixons to run rampant through the Sandamp;Ls.Yet now free of interference, the regulators are creating aclimate of bloody-mindedness, jeopardizing otherwise safeSandamp;Ls, exposing the government to potentially explosive legalliabilities, running up the cost of the Sandamp;L fiasco and doingmore than anything else to slow the economy to the brink ofrecession.</LP><TEXT>   Anyone who doubts that regulators have run berserk shouldread the extracts alongside from the opinion in the Franklincase by Federal District Judge Dale Saffels, himself formerhead of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board of Topeka. Andespecially to contrast it with the opinion in the Lincolncase by Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin, formerenforcement head at the Securities and Exchange Commission.In dispatching Mr. Keating's brazen suit to reclaim Lincoln,Judge Sporkin has no trouble citing chapter and verse ofdeception and what he calls &quot;skullduggery.&quot;   The regulators are unable to distinguish this from theFranklin case, in which Judge Saffels finds a good-faithmanagement, indeed one that bailed out a sick Sandamp;L bydeveloping a sophisticated strategy of financial hedges. Thejudge finds that Franklin has not been endangered by itsmanagement; its hedges &quot;have not caused any economic lossesto the institution.&quot; Rather, it's been endangered byregulators pursuing an abstruse argument over hedgeaccounting, debating over the extent to which losses on hedgeinstruments can be amortized against unrealized gains onother instruments against which they were hedged.   The intensity of this pursuit is frightening. Theregulators had previously blown the Silverado and Centrustcases, and weren't about to let another one get away. Theexaminer pounced on Franklin's 10K, having only read one suchdocument in his life. The regulators' general counsel set outa strategy of &quot;pointing a finger&quot; at the thrift's management,and then gave instructions not to follow up management'sreport that its bond trustee would not regard certain filingsas grounds to exercise claims to collateral. Elsewhere in theopinion, the judge repeatedly complains that documentsfavorable to Franklin were missing from the record.   On our reading of the record, Judge Saffels was generousin his finding that regulators had not acted in bad faith.Yet they obtained a stay of his ruling from a higher courtand reseized Franklin. Now, without waiting for a fullhearing of their appeal, they've moving for insolvency.   The Franklin case, moreover, is hardly the only case ofregulatory excess. In Oregon, Judge Owen Panner last weekissued a final judgment in favor of the owners of Far WestFederal. He said that the government's plan to renege on its1987 agreement with the owners would violate their rightagainst takings. Dozens of similar cases are in variouscourtrooms across the nation.   This goes far to explain why the cost of the thriftproblem keeps rising. Regulators have themselves decimatedFranklin, and probably other institutions as well. Becausethe government has insured the depositors, taxpayers willhave to foot the cost of this further damage. Indeed,ultimately they may have to foot it twice. If the bureaucratsagain lose in court, taxpayers will be stuck with amultimillion-dollar claim for compensation from owners andbondholders.   Naturally, too, frightening cases like Franklin frightenthe rest of the industry. Why should even the best managerbuy into a possibly salvageable thrift if he has to subjecthimself to such regulators? How can present thriftmanagements move at all?   The same regulatory climate is spreading throughout theeconomy. In particular, jitters have spread to the commercialbanks, whose regulators have decided to avoid an Sandamp;L problemat whatever cost. With everyone afraid of taking a bad risk,no one takes any risk, fewer and fewer loans are made, theeconomy crawls more and more slowly. Balance sheets getsorrier and sorrier, and regulators see more and moreevidence for more and more stringency.   Yes, there surely has been fraud and excess to correct,but if financial safety is the purpose there is also a needfor prudence and discrimination. Yet rather than reform theunderlying flaw of deposit insurance, we are sendingexaminers who are supposed to second-guess the good loans andthe bad. Bankers are bad enough at this; who ever believedbureaucrats would be better?</TEXT></DOC>
