The Applicant is a limited-purpose corporation incorporated under thelaws of the State of Delaware. One stockholder, Leo E. Zickler, owns allof the Applicant's issued and outstanding shares of capital stock. Mr.Zickler intends to sell all of the issued and outstanding shares of capitalstock of the Applicant to Montgomery Capital Corporation, a company incorporatedin the state of Delaware and whose primary business is structured mortgagefinance. Upon such sale, Applicant would be retitled Montgomery AcceptanceCorporation IV, and an amendment to the application will be filed settingforth the details of the sale, including the persons controlling MontgomeryCapital Corporation.2. Applicant was formed to act as the depositor (the ``Depositor'') ofone or more trusts (each a ``Trust'') each pursuant to a trust agreement(a ``Trust Agreement''). Each Trust Agreement will provide that each Trustwill be restricted in its activities to (i) issuing and selling bonds inseries (the ``Bonds''), each pursuant to an indenture; and (ii) acquiring,owning, holding and pledging Mortgage Certificates (as hereinafter defined)in connection therewith; (iii) acquiring the rights to amounts remittedor to be remitted to entities issuing and selling Bonds secured by mortgage-relatedcollateral; and (iv) engaging in such other activities that are necessary,suitable or convenient to accomplish the foregoing or are incidental theretoor connected therewith.3. Each Trust will issue one or more series (each a ``Series'') of Bonds.Each series of Bonds issued by a Trust will constitute obligations solelyof such Trust. Each Trust will be created under the laws of one of thestates of the United States of America pursuant to a separate Trust Agreementbetween the Applicant, acting as settlor, depositor and sole beneficialowner, and an independent bank, trust company or other fiduciary, actingas owner trustee (the ``Owner Trustee''). Under the terms of each TrustAgreement, the Applicant will convey trust property to the related Trustin return for certificates or other instruments evidencing beneficial ownershipof the Trust created under such Trust Agreement (``Trust Certificates'').4. Once a Trust has issued all the Series to be issued by such Trust, theApplicant may sell all or a portion of the Trust Certificates representingthe beneficial ownership in such Trust to (i) institutions or (ii) non-institutionsthat are ``accredited investors'' as defined in Rule 501(a) of the 1933Act (each an ``Eligible Purchaser'').5. Institutional investors will have such knowledge and experience in financialand business matters as to be capable to evaluate the risks of purchasingthe Trust Certificates and to understand the volatility of interest ratefluctuations as they affect the value of mortgages, mortgage-related securitiesand residual interests therein.  6. Non-institutional accredited investors that purchase the Trust Certificatesof a Trust will be limited to not more than 15, will purchase at least$200,000 of the Trust Certificates and will have a net worth at the timeof purchase that exceeds $1,000,000 (exclusive of their primary residence).Further, non-institutional accredited investors will have such knowledgeand experience in financial and business matters, specifically in the fieldof mortgage-related securities, as to be able to evaluate the risk of purchasingthe Trust Certificates and will have direct, personal and significant experiencein investments in mortgage-related securities and because of such knowledgeand experience, understand the volatility of interest rate fluctuationsas they affect the value of mortgage-related securities and residual intereststherein. Owners will be limited to mortgage lenders, thrift institutions,commercial and investment banks, savings and loan associations, pensionfunds, employee benefit plans, insurance companies, mutual funds (eachsuch mutual fund being required to satisfy itself that the purchase ofa Trust Certificate will comply with section 12(d)(1) of the Act), realestate investment trusts, master limited partnerships and/or other institutionalor non-institutional investors as described above which customarily engagein the purchase of mortgages and mortage-related securities.  7. The Owners of the Trust will not be able to alter the Mortgage Certificatesinitially deposited by Applicant into the Trusts, except to the extentpermitted by the limited right to substitute Mortgage Certificates as describedherein and in no event will such right to substitute Mortgage Certificatesresult in a diminution of the value of the Mortgage Certificates.  8. Each Series of Bonds will be sold to institutional or retail investorsin firm commitment underwritten public offerings or private placements.Each Series of Bonds will be sold pursuant to an offering circular, a prospectusor a private placement memorandum (referred to hereinafter, collectively,as a ``prospectus'') containing all material disclosures required by theterms of the 1940 Act, to the extent applicable. The Bonds will be issuedby a Trust pursuant to an indenture (the ``Indenture''), between such Trustand an independent trustee (the ``Bond Trustee''). The Indenture for eachSeries of Bonds will be subject to the provisions of the Trust IndentureAct of 1939, unless an exemption from some or all of the provisions ofsuch Act is available.  9. The Applicant will cause each Trust to issue Bonds which will be securedby Mortgage certificates consisting of any combination of ``fully modifiedpass-through'' mortgage-backed certificates fully guaranteed as to principaland interest by the Government National Mortgage Association (``GNMA'');Mortgage Participation Certificates issued by the Federal Home Loan MortgageCorporation (``FHLMC''); Guaranteed Mortgage Pass-Through Certificatesissued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (``FNMA''); StrippedMortgaged-Backed Securities issued by GNMA, FHLMC or FNMA; and strippedmortgage-backed securities issued by the Applicant (``SPLITS'')\1\<NOTE/> (collectively, the ``Mortgage Certificates''). The MortgageCertificates that initially secure the Bonds will have an aggregate ``CollateralValue'' (as defined in the related Indenture) at least equal to the principalamount of the Bonds. In addition to the Mortgage Certificates, the Bondsmay be secured by: (i) Distributions on the Mortgage Certificates; (ii)cash, demand notes, a letter of credit or Eligible Investments (as definedin the Application) or any combination thereof, if required with respectto any Series to be deposited in the accounts and funds described below;(iii) the reinvestment income on such distributions and deposits; (iv)payments under any guaranteed investment contract; and/or (v) paymentsunder any minimum principal payment agreement (collectively with the MortgageCertificates, ``Collateral''). The Collateral relating to a Series willinclude a separate collection account for each Series and may include adebt service reserve fund or other reserve funds and payments made underany guaranteed investment contract and minimum principal payment agreement,in each case as specified in the prospectus for a particular Series.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ SPLITS are similar to Stripped Mortgate-Backed Securitiesissued by GNMA, FHLMC and FNMA in that SPLITS are issued in series of twoor more classes, with each class representing a specified undivided fractionalinterest in principal distributions and/or interest distributions on theunderlying pool of assets, and the fractional interest of each class arenot identical but in the aggregate represent 100% of the principal andinterest distributions on the particular pool. In addition, each seriesof SPLITS (a) will be rated in one of the two highest rating categoriesby at least one nationally recognized statistical rating agency, (b) willrepresent an underlying pool of assets consisting entirely of ``fully-modified,pass-through'' mortgage-backed certificates fully guaranteed by GNMA, MortgageParticipation Certificates issued by FHLMC or Guaranteed Mortgage Pass-ThroughCertificates issued by FNMA and (c) will be ``mortgage related securities''within the meaning of section 3(a)(41) of the Securities Exchange Act of1934, as amended. Use of SPLITS as collateral for Bonds will not reducethe security afforded to Bondholders nor expose them to a level of risksignificantly different from that present in a Series of Bonds directlysecured by the certificates guaranteed by FNMA, GNMA or FHLMC in whichthe SPLITS represent an interest.10. The Trust may elect to treat the Collateral securing a Series of Bondsas a ``real estate mortgage investment conduit'' (a ``REMIC'') pursuantto the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.11. The Trust will pledge to the Bond Trustee as security for a Seriesof Bonds its entire right, title and interest in the Mortgage Certificatespurchased by the Trust. The Mortgage Certificates will be held by the BondTrustee or on behalf of the Bond Trustee by an independent custodian. Suchindependent custodian will not be an affiliate of the Applicant or theOwner Trustee.12. Bonds of a Series may bear interest at fixed rates or at rates whichvary in relation to an index specified in the related prospectus. Bondsbearing interest at a variable rate will be subject to maximum interestrates (``interest rate caps'') or to minimum interest rates in the caseof inverse variable rate Bonds. The maximum and minimum interest ratesmay vary from period to period, and always will be specified in the relatedprospectus. The Bonds will be structured so that the cash flow generatedby the related Mortgage Certificates securing the Bonds, together withthe other Colleteral, plus the reinvestment earnings thereon at the assumedreinvestment rate specified in the related prospectus (which rate willbe no greater than the maximum rate permitted by the rating agency or agenciesrating such Series) will be sufficient to provide for the full and timelypayment of the Bonds of such Series (even if the interest rates on variablerate Bonds were the maximum applicable interest rates for each specifiedperiod).13. The Applicant anticipates that one or more Series of Bonds may consistof one or more classes of Bonds (each a ``Class''). Some Classes may havestated maturity dates earlier or later than other Classes of such Series.The Classes with different stated maturity dates may differ, among otherthings, in the date by which such Classes will be fully paid, priorityof principal payments and interest rate.14. Each Trust may have a limited right to substitute new Mortgage Certificates(``Substitute Mortgage Certificates'') for Mortgage Certificates initiallypledged as security for the Bonds, provided that such substitution doesnot result in a reduction of the ratings assigned to the Bonds by the oneor more nationally recognized rating agencies.15. In the event that principal payments on the Bonds of a Series are madeother than on a monthly basis, the Bonds of such Series may be subjectto special redemption as specified in the related Indenture. In addition,all or a portion of the bonds of a Series may be subject to redemptionby the Trust issuing such Series, at the option of the Owers of such Trustunder the limited circumstances provided in the related Indenture and disclosedin the related prospectus. Any such redemption would be at a price equalto the percentage of the outstanding principal amount of Bonds so redeemedstated in the related prospectus, plus accrued interest. The Applicantsubmits that no such redemption provision would make any of the Bonds orany of the Trust Certificates a ``redeemable security'' for purposes ofthe 1940 Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conditions to Order</ITAG>Applicant agrees that if the requested order is granted it will be expresslyconditioned on the following:A. Conditions Relating to the Bonds1. Each Series of Bonds will be registered under the Securities Act of1933 (the ``1933 Act''), unless offered in a transaction exempt from registrationeither pursuant to section 4(2) of the 1933 Act or because such Seriesof Bonds is offered and sold outside the United States to Non-U.S. personsin reliance upon an opinion of U.S. counsel that registration is not required.No single offering of the Bonds sold within and outside the United Stateswill be made without registration of all such Bonds under the 1933 Act,without obtaining a no-action letter permitting such offering or otherwisecomplying with applicable standards then governing such offerings. In allcases, Applicant will adopt agreements and procedures reasonably designedto prevent such debt securities from being offered or sold in the UnitedStates or to U.S. persons (except as U.S. counsel may then advise is permissible).Disclosure provided to purchasers located outside the United States willbe substantially the same as that provided to U.S. investors in the UnitedStates offerings.2. The Bonds will be ``morgage related securities'' within the meaningof section 3(a)(41) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.The Collateral directly securing the Bonds will be limited to mortgagepass-through certificates, including Stripped Mortgage-Backed Securities,guaranteed by GNMA or issued and guaranteed by FNMA or FHLMC and SPLITS.3. If new Mortgage Certificates are substituted, the Substitute MortgageCertificates must: (i) Be of equal or better quality than those replaced;(ii) have similar payment terms and cash flow as those replaced; (iii)be insured or guaranteed to the same extent as those replaced; and (iv)meet the conditions set forth in paragraphs (2) and (4). In addition, newMortgage Certificates may not be substituted for more than 40% of the aggregateface amont of the Mortgage Certificates initially pledged. In no eventmay any new Mortgage Certificates be substituted for any Substitute MortgageCertificates.4. The Collateral will be held by the Bond Trustee or on behalf of theBond Trustee by an independent custodian. Neither the custodian nor theBond Trustee will be an affiliate (as the term ``affiliate'' is definedin Rule 405 under the 1933 Act, 17 CFR 230.405) of the Applicant. The BondTrustee for each series will be provided with a first priority perfectedsecurity or lien interest in and to all Collateral securing such series.5. Each Series of Bonds will be rated in one of the two highest bond ratingcategories by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating agencythat is not affiliated with the Applicant. The Bonds will not be considered``redeemable securities'' within the meaning of section 2(a)(32) of the1940 Act.6. No. less often than annually, an independent public accountant willaudit the books and records of each Trust. In addition, as long as anyBonds of a Series are outstanding, on the basis of a review of the Collateral,the independent accountant will report at least annually on whether theanticipated payments of principal and interest on the Collateral for eachsuch Series continue to be adequate to pay the principal of and intereston the related Bonds in accordance with their terms. All accountant's reportswith respect to payments on the Bonds will be provided to the Bond Trustee.B. Conditions Relating to Fees and Expenses1. For any Series of Bonds, including those Series of Bonds that the Trustelects to treat as a REMIC, the Trust will provide for the timely paymentof all anticipated fees and expenses to be incurred in connection withthe administration of the Bonds and the Collateral for such Series in amanner satisfactory to the agency or agencies that rate the Bonds. Eitherthe Owners of the Trust Certificates of any such Trust will be personallyliable pursuant to the Trust Agreement for such fees and expenses, or paymentof such fees and expenses will be provided for by one or more of the methodsor any combination thereof described in the application.C. Conditions Relating to Variable Rate Bonds1. Each Class of variable rate Bonds will have set maximum interest rates(interest rate caps) which may vary from period to period as specifiedin the related prospectus.2. The Collateral pledged to secure the Bonds will be sufficient to providefor the full and timely payment of the Bonds then outstanding, assumingthe maximum applicable interest rates for each specified period on variablerate Bonds.\2\<NOTE/> Such Collateral will not be released from the lien of theIndenture prior to the payment of the Bonds (except pursuant to the limitedright of substitution described above). Specifically, reduction of interestpayments due on a Series of Bonds that contains a Class or Classes of variablerate Bonds will not result in the release of any of the Collateral (exceptas aforesaid) from the lien of the Indenture prior to the payment of theBonds.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In the case of a Series of Bonds that contains a classor classes of variable rate Bonds, a number of mechanisms exist to ensurethat this representation will be valid notwithstanding subsequent potentialincreases in the interest rate applicable to the variable rate Bonds. Proceduresthat have been identified to date for achieving this result include theuse of (i) interest rate caps for the variable rate Bonds: (ii) ``inverse''variable rate Bonds (which pay a lower rate of interest as the rate increaseson the corresponding ``normal'' variable rate Bonds); (iii) variable ratecollateral to secure the Bonds; (iv) interest rate swap agreements (underwhich the issuer of the Bonds would make periodic payments to a counterpartyat a fixed rated of interest based on a stated principal amount, such asthe principal amount of Bonds in the variable rate Class, in exchange forreceiving corresponding periodic payments from the counterparty at a variablerate of interest based on the same principal amount); and (v) hedge agreements(including interest rate futures and option contracts, under which theissuer of the Bonds would realize gains during periods of rising interestrates sufficient to cover the higher interest payments that would becomedue during such periods on the variable rate Class of Bonds). It is expectedthat other mechanisms may be identified in the future. Applicant will givethe Commission notice by letter of any such additional mechanisms beforethey are utilized in order to give the Commission an opportunity to raiseany questions as to the appropriateness of their use. In all cases, thesemechanisms will be adequate to ensure the accuracy of the representationand will be adequate to meet the standards required to maintain the ratingon the Bonds, and no Bonds will be issued for which this is not the case.D.Conditions Relating to Eligible Purchasers1. The Owners of the Trust Certificates will agree to be bound by the termsof the applicable Trust Agreement.2. Trust Certificates will be sold only to Eligible Purchasers.3. Each Sale of Trust Certificates to an Eligible Purchaser will qualifyas a transaction not involving a public offering within the meaning ofsection 4(2) of the 1933 Act.4. The Applicant will sell the Trust Certificates of each Trust to no morethan 100 Eligible Purchasers, of which no more than 15 will be non-institutionalaccredited investors.5. The Trust Agreement relating to each Trust will prohibit the transferof any Trust Certificates of such Trust if there would be more than 15non-institutional accredited investors as Owners of such Trust and if therewould be more than 100 Owners of such Trust in total at any time.6. Each Purchaser of a Trust Certificate will represent that it is purchasingthe Trust Certificate for investment purposes only and that it will holdsuch Trust Certificate in its own name and not as a nominee for undisclosedinvestors.7. No owner of a Trust Certificate will be affiliated with the Bond Trustee;no holders of a controlling (as that term is defined in Rule 405 underthe 1933 Act) equity interest in the Trust will be affiliated with eitherthe custodian of the Bond Collateral or the rating agency rating the Bonds;and the Owner Trustee will not purchase any Trust Certificate, but willfunction as a legal stakeholder for the assets of the Trust.8. The above conditions apply to both the initial offering and sale ofa Trust Certificate by each Trust and the resale of a Trust Certificateby an Eligible Purchaser to a new Eligible Purchaser.E. Conditions Relating to Transfer of Control of ApplicantIn the event the Applicant sells its equity interest in the future, otherthan the sale contemplated as described above, and such sale results inthe transfer of control (as that term is defined in Rule 405 under the1933 Act) of the Applicant, the relief afforded the Applicant will notapply to subsequent bond offerings by the Applicant or any issuer establishedby the Applicant unless the Applicant has applied for an amended orderidentifying the proposed transferee and such order as amended, has beengranted. (Such application to amend will be limited in scope to the descriptionof the proposed transfer.)<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, underdelegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
