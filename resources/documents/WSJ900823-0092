The agreement calls for Washington Post to set up alimited partnership with Baltimore-based American PersonalCommunications Inc., which earlier this year receivedlicenses from the Federal Communications Commission to buildand test the system in the Washington area.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, Washington Post will invest $6 million to beused for &quot;research, technology exploration and labor costsover a two-to-three-year period,&quot; said Wayne Schelle, APC'schairman.   If the test is successful, the partners said they will askthe FCC for an operating license to provide service in theWashington area and will pursue licenses for other U.S.markets.   Like cellular networks, the new network will usetransceivers placed around the city to transmit and relaycalls. However, the new system is expected to require farless electricity than cellular systems. This, proponents say,will allow for phones that are lighter than current cellularportables, because their batteries are smaller.   Mr. Schelle's network is still experimental. But if suchnetworks test successfully, analysts have said, they couldpose a serious long-term challenge not only to cellular-phonenetworks, which provide portable phone services today, butalso to local phone companies that have long enjoyed amonopoly on hard-wired residential and business phoneservices.   Mr. Schelle envisions a phone that will sell for about $75once full-scale networks are operating, plus a monthlyservice charge of $35 to $45 a month by 1995. Portablecellular phones, by contrast, sell for $1,000, and servicecosts about $90 to $100 a month. Mr. Schelle and WashingtonPost were partners in the Washington-Baltimore area's firstcellular network in 1983. He ended up selling his 40%interest the following year for $52.5 million. The Post leftthe cellular business in 1986, realizing a $200 millionafter-tax gain on its investment in properties that alsoincluded networks in Detroit and Miami.   &quot;This gives us a successful partner with sufficientresources,&quot; Mr. Schelle said. &quot;It's like starting the game inthe fourth inning.&quot; A spokesman for the Post said the companywill set up a new division to provide and market pocketphoneservices if the Washington tests succeed.   &quot;We're not a company that likes to flip assets,&quot; he said.&quot;Our aim is to do this broadly and systematically in a way inwhich we can have a sizable stance.&quot;   The Post is not alone. A growing number of companies areeither planning or have begun to erect networks that willprovide pocketphone services. In England, several companiesalready provide a service called Personal CommunicationsNetwork, or PCN, that allows customers to place calls onpocketphones. And several companies, including partnershipsinvolving regional Bell companies, have begun buildingnetworks in England to provide two-way phone services.   In the U.S. the FCC has awarded about 20 licenses to test&quot;personal communications services&quot; or PCS. Companies such asAPC, Millicom Inc. and Graphic Scanning Corp., have receivedpermission from the FCC to test their PCS systems at variousfrequencies.   Nynex Corp. recently announced plans to install an adjunctpocketphone-type system to its cellular network, usingnetwork equipment from American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. andQualcomm Inc.   Motorola Inc. plans a satellite-based service. The companywants to offer portable-phone service through a network ofmore than 70 low-orbit satellites by the end of the decade.   The Post and APC expect to begin testing the system byyear end and to have it working fully in suburban Marylandand Virginia by the end of 1991.   The Washington test will involve transmission andreception in two frequencies -- 900 MHz, which currentcellular networks use, and 1800-1900 MHz, Mr. Schelle said.   In the first stage, as many as 2,000 customers will get aone-way service, with which they can place calls afterreceiving a message on an attached pager. In the secondstage, expected to be available by the end of next year,customers will get two-way service allowing them to send andreceive calls.</TEXT></DOC>
