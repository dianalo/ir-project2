At midday, contracts for April delivery of West TexasIntermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, stood at $16.03 per42-gallon barrel, down 43 cents from Wednesday's close on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange.   Among March contracts for refined products, wholesale heatingoil was selling at 45.45 cents a gallon, down 0.95 cent fromWednesday, while unleaded gasoline stood at 45.45 cents per gallon,0.90 cent lower.   Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at EldersFutures Inc., said fundamental and technical factors were pushingthe prices lower, with crude touching as little as $15.98 a barrelat one point before struggling back.   ``OPEC is producing about 1 million barrels a day more than itwas a month ago, and this perception is getting into the market _which isn't thrilled by it,'' he said.   Recent estimates have put production by members of theOrganization of petroleum Exporting Countries close to 18 millionbarrels a day.   Beutel said the slide also picked up after crude broke below$16.37 a barrel, ``which had been seen as a very important supportlevel.''</TEXT></DOC>
