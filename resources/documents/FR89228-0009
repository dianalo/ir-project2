Texas Sea Rim Pipeline, Inc. filed a letter purporting to accept ablanket certificate. Stingray Pipeline Company filed a letter indicatingan error in Appendix B of Order No. 509 regarding the shoreward terminusof Stingray's OCS facilities. The Commission grants Point Arguello's requestfor leave to withdraw its request for rehearing. The Commission has consideredall of the other filings (including NRM's request, Stingray's letter andTexas Sea Rim's letter) in issuing this order.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Timely requests for rehearing were filed on January 9,1989, by Amoco Production Company, Kerr-McGee Corporation and MarathonOil Company; ANR Pipeline Company; Arco Oil and Gas Marathon Oil Company;ANR Pipeline Company; Arco Oil and Gas Company; Associated Gas Distributors;Black Marlin Pipeline Company; Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation andColumbia Gulf Transmission Company; Enron Interstate Pipelines; FMI Hydrocarbons,Inc.; High Island Offshore System and U-T Offshore System; Indicated Producers;Pacific Interstate Offshore Company; Pacific Offshore Pipeline Company;Pennzoil Exploration andamp; Production Company; Phillips Petroleum Company;Sea Robin Pipeline Company; Tarpon Gas Marketing Ltd. and Vesta EnergyCompany; Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company; Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation;and Trancontinental Gas Pipeline Corporation. <ITAG tagnum="84">A. Need for the Rule  </ITAG>Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) argues that theCommission failed to articulate a reasonable basis for adopting Order No.509. Noting that ``many of the interstate pipelines to whom the rule isaddressed are already providing open and nondiscriminatory access underOrder Nos. 436 and 500,'' \5\<NOTE/> Texas Eastern argues that the rule is unnecessary. The Commissiondisagrees. The fact that ``many'' interstate pipelines already providefor open and nondiscriminatory access under Part 284 of the Commission'sregulations does not resolve potential access problems on those OCS pipelinesthat do not provide such transportation service. For the reasons elaboratedin Order No. 509, the Commission has determined that the OCSLA mandatesthat all pipelines that operate on the OCS do so on an open access basis. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Request of Texas Eastern at 3.  Texas Eastern contends that the complaints the Commission received regardingaccess to transportation on the OCS were motivated by the Commission'spolicy against brokering of existing transportation rights on the OCS andthat these complaints do not demonstrate a need to issue mandatory blankettransportation certificates to all OCS pipelines.\6\<NOTE/> The Commission disagrees. As discussed in Order No. 509,the Commission has a duty to carry out its statutory responsibilities underthe OCSLA. Capacity brokering is an alternative that the Commission iscurrently exploring.\7\<NOTE/> An equally valid means of ensuring the most efficient useof capacity is to establish an open access program on the OCS by issuingblanket transportation certificates to all OCS pipelines.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 4.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Brokering of Interstate Natural Gas Capacity, Docket No.RM88-13-000, 53 FR 15061 (Apr. 27, 1988), IV FERC Stats. andamp; Regs. andpara;32,460 (Apr. 4, 1988). The Commission's capacity brokering NOPR has revealedseveral complicated issues that are involved in establishing any capacitybrokering program on a generic basis or generically in a rulemaking proceeding.The Commission has decided, on an experimental basis, to accept the capacitybrokering proposal of United Gas Pipe Line Company, 46 FERC andpara; 61,060(Jan. 24, 1989), Order Amending Blanket Certificate.  The Part 284 blanket transportation certificates require all OCS pipelinesto offer interruptible transportation, and to offer it on a nondiscriminatorybasis. Therefore, instead of allowing the holder of the existing firm capacityrights to sell off, or ``broker,'' its unused capacity, Order No. 509 compelsall OCS pipelines to offer nondiscriminatory interruptible transportationto potential new shippers. The rule promotes full utilization of the capacityof OCS pipelines without disrupting existing firm transportation arrangements. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Pro Rata Allocation of Capacity  </ITAG>Although nothing in Order No. 509 mandates pro rata allocation of capacity,several commenters requested rehearing based on the Commission's statementthat it would consider pro rata allocation of capacity as an availableremedy in potential future case-specific inquiries under section 5 of theOCSLA.\8\<NOTE/> Associated Gas Distributors (AGD) asks the Commission toeither clarify that it did not intend to find that it has the authorityto require pro rata allocation of capacity or grant rehearing on the issue.\9\<NOTE/> High Island Offshore System and U-T Offshore System (HIOS)seek assurance of the right to challenge any future attempt by the Commission,either on a case-specific or a generic basis, to impose prorationing onthe OCS.\1\\0\<NOTE/> Texas Eastern contends that the Commission lacks legal authorityunder section 5 of the OCSLA to impose a generic pro rata allocation schemeon OCS pipelines.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>See</T3> Order No. 509, 53 FR at 50,927, III FERC Stats. andamp; Regs.at 31,273.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ <T3>See</T3> AGD's rehearing request at 5.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ <T3>See</T3> HIOS's rehearing request at 5.  Because the Commission did not adopt any requirement of pro rata allocation,Order No. 509 explicitly deferred consideration of issues of the Commission'slegal authority to do so.\1\\1\<NOTE/> Thus, the Commission agrees with HIOS and AGD that theselegal issues were not presented or resolved in Order No. 509, are not ripeon rehearing, and may be addressed on a clean slate in any future proceedingin which they may arise.\1\\2\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ <T3>See</T3> Order No. 509, 53 FR at p. 50,927, III FERC Stats. andamp; Regs.at 31,279.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ The statement in Order No. 509 regarding pro rata allocationon a case-specific basis reflects the Commission's belief (as well as thebelief of several other commenters on the NOPR) that under section 5(e)of the OCSLA the Commission has the authority to determine, in consultationwith the Secretary of Energy, the proportionate amounts to be transported,after a full hearing with case-specific findings and after taking intoaccount, <T3>inter alia</T3>, conservation and waste.  Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) interprets Order No. 509 aspermitting OCS pipelines to include pro rata transportation schemes intheir tariffs.\1\\3\<NOTE/> Tennessee declares that affording this discretion to OCSpipelines when the Commission itself has decided not to exercise it isinappropriate and invites service disruptions and abuse.\1\\4\<NOTE/> The short answer is that such tariff provisions are beyondthe scope of this proceeding. If any OCS pipeline chooses to file a tariffcontaining pro rata provisions, such provisions can and will be consideredon a case-specific basis in response to the filing, and any party thatopposes those provisions will have ample opportunity to protest or interveneto express its views.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ <T3>See</T3> Tennessee's rehearing request at 3, citing to Order No. 509,53 FR at 50,927, III FERC Stats. andamp; Regs. at 31,276-277.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ Tennessee's request for rehearing at 3.  The Indicated Producers assert that Order No. 509 allows OCS pipelinesto choose an allocation method that will deny access to non-owner shippers,and request that the Commission require OCS pipelines to transport gasfor all shippers who request transportation service and, if necessary,to prorate capacity among shippers.\1\\5\<NOTE/> The Indicated Producers also believe that the provisionsfor voluntary reallocation of firm transportation capacity in Order No.509 allow owner-shippers on the OCS (through a simple unwillingness tovoluntarily relinquish capacity) to bar access to firm transportation fornon-owner shippers.\1\\6\<NOTE/> These arguments, in essence, are arguments in favor of requiringpro rata allocation. For the same reasons it chose not to adopt a genericpro rata allocation scheme, as discussed in Order No. 509, the Commissiondenies the Indicated Producers' requests. Requiring OCS pipelines to provideblanket transportation service will promote use of OCS transportation capacityby assuring that potential shippers will have nondiscriminatory accessto unused firm capacity, without disrupting existing transportation arrangements. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ <T3>See</T3> the Indicated Producers' request for rehearing at 7-8.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 9.  <ITAG tagnum="84">C. Scope of Order No. 509  </ITAG>Tarpon Gas Marketing, Ltd. and Vesta Energy Company (Tarpon) allege thatthe Commission ignored issues raised in Tarpon's comments on the NOPR.\1\\7\<NOTE/> Tarpon alleges, specifically, that Order No. 509 containsno discussion of Tarpon's suggestions: (1) To require OCS pipelines toapply for blanket certificates to govern their <T3>onshore</T3> operations; and (2) that the Commission adopt similarrequirements for pipelines subject to the Mineral Leasing Act.\1\\8\<NOTE/> Both suggestions are more ambitious than what the Commissionproposed in the NOPR, both are concerned with the onshore operations ofinterstate natural gas pipelines, and, for that reason, both fall beyondthe scope of this rulemaking proceeding.\1\\9\<NOTE/> This rulemaking proceeding and Order No. 509 only concernthe operations of interstate natural gas pipelines on the OCS.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ <T3>See</T3> Tarpon's rehearing request at 1.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ 30 U.S.C. 181, <T3>et seq.</T3> (1982).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ The Commission cannot mandate blanket transportationservice onshore simply because pipelines also have operations on the OCS. ANR Pipeline Company (ANR), HIOS and Tennessee ask for rehearing basedon the Commission's decision to implement section 5 of the OCSLA only withrespect to jurisdictional interstate natural gas pipelines that hold acertificate under section 7 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) \2\\0\<NOTE/> authorizing the construction and operation of facilitieson the OCS. ANR contends that the Commission's decision not to apply OrderNo. 509 to gathering or producer-owned facilities on the OCS is unreasonableand discriminatory.\2\\1\<NOTE/> Tennessee contends that the Commission should require nondiscriminatorytransportation by all OCS transporters if it does so for NGA jurisdictionalpipelines.\2\\2\<NOTE/> HIOS submits that there is no just basis for declining toestablish requirements for facilities owned and operated by producers thatare comparable to the mandatory blanket certificate, open season, and relatedrequirements imposed on OCS pipelines.\2\\3\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ 15 U.S.C. 717f (1982).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ <T3>See</T3> ANR's rehearing request at 12.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ <T3>See</T3> Tennessee's rehearing request at 19-21.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ <T3>See</T3> HIOS's rehearing request at 6. It is within the Commission's discretion to decide how to implement section5 of the OCSLA, and there is a reasonable basis for taking a case specificapproach with respect to nonjurisdictional OCS pipelines. The most rationalstarting point for promulgating regulations to implement section 5 of theOCSLA is with interstate pipelines that are clearly within the Commission'sjurisdiction under the NGA. Moreover, the Commission alreadly has an establishedopen access program that can, with few modifications, be applied to suchpipelines. The Commission recognizes, however, that the open access mandateof the OCSLA applies to all pipeline operations on the OCS, and will considerappropriate measures for remedying discriminatory access to other OCS facilitieson a case by case basis.Enron Interstate Pipelines (Enron) challenges the Commission's statementin Order No. 509 that ``If the Commission receives complaints regardinggathering facilities it will, on a case-specific basis, use its ancillaryauthority, its authority under sections 4 and 5 of the NGA, and its authorityunder section 5 of the OCSLA, as appropriate under the circumstances presented''(citations omitted). Enron contends that the Commission lacks jurisdictionunder sections 4 and 5 of the NGA to take such action.\24\<NOTE/> The short answer is that the Commission's section 4 and 5authority with respect to gathering facilities on the OCS is beyond thescope of this proceeding, and is not ripe for consideration on rehearingof Order No. 509. Enron may challenge an assertion of such authority ifand when the Commission exercises it, in any proceeding in which the issuearises.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\<T3>See </T3>Enron's request for rehearing at 5.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Authority to Issue Blanket Certificates</ITAG>Texas Eastern, HIOS, ANR and Sea Robin argue that the Commission lackslegal authority under the NGA to issue mandatory blanket transportationcertificates to OCS pipelines.\25\<NOTE/> Texas Eastern, for example, contends that the OCSLA doesnot empower the Commission to issue any type of transportation authorization.The argument of Texas Eastern and others runs as follows: (1) Section 7(c)of the NGA requires that before a natural gas company may engage in thetransportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, there must be inforce a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Commission;(2) section 7(e) of the NGA provides that the applicant must demonstratethat it is willing and able to undertake the proposed transportation andthat such transportation is required by the present or future public convenienceand necessity; and, therefore, (3) if the applicant is unwilling to acceptthe certificate, the willing and able standard has not been met and thecertificate cannot be issued.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\<T3>See</T3> ANR's rehearing request at 10; HIOS's rehearing request at7; Sea Robin's rehearing request at 15; and Texas Eastern's rehearing requestat 5.The Commission disagrees with these commenters; their argument ignoresthe presence of section 5 of the OCSLA and its mandate that OCS pipelinesmust provide open and nondiscriminatory access to both owner and nonownershippers. Order No. 509 only applies to those interstate natural gas pipelinesthat hold a certificate under section 7 of the NGA authorizing the constructionand operation of facilities on the OCS. The willingness of OCS pipelinesto provide transportation service on or across the OCS was establishedwhen they accepted their existing certificates and commenced service thereunder.The blanket certificates issued by Order No. 509 simply impose conditionsof service that are mandated by section 5 of the OCSLA. Congress establisheda condition of open and nondiscriminatory access for the transportationof oil and natural gas on or across the OCS. OCS pipelines are not compelledto operate on the OCS, but if they choose to do so they must be willingto provide open and nondiscriminatory access to transporation services.Compliance with section 5 of the OCSLA is required of pipelines operatingon the OCS; it is not a matter as to which they have discretion.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. The Rate Determinations</ITAG>Several commenters argue that the rate provisions of Order No. 509 areunlawful and unclear.\26\<NOTE/> Columbia states that in order for the Commission to properlyexercise its authority under sections 5 of the NGA it must: (1) Find theexisting rates of a pipeline to be unjust and unreasonable; (2) find therates that it seeks to impose on a pipeline are just and reasonable; and(3) support each finding by substantial evidence. Columbia also statesthat section 5 of the NGA places the burden of proof on the Commissionwith respect to these findings. Columbia and others argue that the Commissiondid not properly find that the existing rates for transactions under individualsection 7 certificates are unjust and unreasonable. Moreover, because OrderNo. 509 provides an opportunity fo pipelines to refile their current ratesfor individually certificated transportation if the pipeline can demonstratethat such rates are not unjust, unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory,\27\<NOTE/> Columbia and Tennessee argue that the Commission has improperlyshifted the burden of proof to the pipelines to prove that their existingrates are just and reasonable.\28\<NOTE/> Finally, Tennessee and Columbia both dispute the validityof the Commission's reasons for finding that an OCS pipeline's currentrates are unjust and unreasonable if they do not conform to the requirementsof andSection;andSection;284.7, 284.8(d) and 284.9(d) of the Commission's regulations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\<T3>See</T3> ANR's rehearing request at 2; Columbia's rehearing requestat 2: Sea Robins's rehearing request at 4-13; Tennessee's rehearing requestat 11-19; and Indicated Producers' rehearing request at 25.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\<T3>See</T3> 18 CFR 284.305(d)(2) (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\Tennessee also contends that Order No. 509 does not provideprocedures for parties (other than the OCS pipeline) to support the retentionof existing rates if the OCS pipeline elects not to refile and justifythem. The short answer is that interested persons will have ample opportunityto protest and intervene, and express their views, with respect to theOCS pipelines' filings regardless of what the OCS pipelines choose to file,whether it be new rates or (as described below) a statement explainingtheir existing rates.Columbia argues that the fact that blanket certificates may be necessaryto satisfy the open access requirements of the OCSLA has nothing to dowith rate determinations. Columbia also argues that the rate design andnondiscrimination requirements in andSection;andSection; 284.7, 284.8(d) and284.9(d) simply apply, as the Commission recognized, in the context oftransportation performed under the blanket certificates and not in thecontext of individually certificated transportation. Tennessee allegesthat nothing in Order No. 509 changes the nature of an OCS pipeline's servicesin terms of the physical flow and the facilities utilized_the fundamentalcharacteristics that determine rate design. Sea Robin argues that the Commission has failed to justify its generictreatment of the existing rates of OCS pipelines. Sea Robin notes the Commissionrelied on the notice and comment procedures of its rulemaking to satisfythe NGA section 5 hearing requirement.\29\<NOTE/> Sea Robin agrees that the Commission can rely on notice andcomment rulemaking procedures as a means to satisfy section 5 of the NGA,but distinguishes the Commission's reliance on <T3>Wisconsin Gas </T3>by noting that the Commission was attempting, inthat instance, to redress the anticompetitive effects of a generic practice(<T3>i.e., </T3>the use of minimum commodity bills). Sea Robin asserts thatthe approach of <T3>Wisconsin Gas </T3>is not appropriate to Order No. 509, where the ratesfound to be unlawful in the rulemaking were not the product of a genericpractice but were the product of circumstances peculiar to each OCS pipelineand where the rates were approved by the Commission on a case by case basis.Sea Robin argues that the notice and comment procedures which overrulesuch rates are not sufficient when the levels of such rates have not beenshown to be a problem of a generalized nature. Sea Robin therefore contendsthat the Commission must grant rehearing of Order No. 509 to provide thatexisting rates will be reviewed in individual proceedings under section5 of the NGA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ Order No. 509, 53 FR at 50,927, III FERC Stats. andamp;Regs. at 31,278 (citing <T3>Wisconsin Gas Co. </T3>v. <T3>FERC. </T3>770 F.2d 1144 (DC Cir. 1985), <T3>cert. denied. </T3>106 S.Ct. 1969 (1986)). As elaborated in Order No. 509, the Commission based its finding on: (1)Its determination that Part 284, Subpart G blanket certificates are requiredto satisfy the open access requirement of the OCSLA; (2) its determinationin Order Nos. 436 and 500 that rates inconsistent with andSection;andSection;284.7, 284.8(d) and 284.9(d) are unjust and unreasonable in the contextof transportation performed under blanket certificates; \30\<NOTE/> and (3) its determination that it would be unduly discriminatoryto subject existing shippers on OCS pipelines to a rate different thanthe rate charged to new shippers on the same pipeline.\31\<NOTE/> In other words, through the rulemaking process the Commissionundertook the burden of establishing pursuant to NGA section 5 that thecurrent rates are unduly discriminatory. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ Sections 284.8 and 284.9 also contain the requirementsof nondiscriminatory access. <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 284.8(b), 284.9(b) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ Order No. 509, 53 FR at 50,930, III FERC Stats. andamp;Regs. at 31,278. As we understand the requests for rehearing, no one is challenging therequirement to file Part 284 rates for use in performing transportationunder the blanket certificate. The sole challenge is to the requirementthat Part 284 rates be utilized in lieu of existing rates with respectto transportation performed pursuant to existing individual certificates.For the reasons discussed in Order No. 509, we continue to believe thatthe existing rates are unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory,because they can result in situations wherein two shippers would be payingdifferent rates for the same service. We believe the discrimination isparticularly glaring if part, but not all, of an existing shipper's firmcapacity is voluntarily reallocated_the new shipper would be paying Part284 rates while the old shipper would be paying the existing rates. Nevertheless,based on reconsideration of this issue, we have concluded that the mostappropriate procedure would be to permit the continued use of the existingrates for transportation under existing certificates until such time asOCS pipelines have had an opportunity to present their views on a casespecific basis. Accordingly, we have revised the rule.OCS pipelines who wish to utilize their current rates after April 1, 1989for transportation performed pursuant to existing certificates must file,no later than March 1, 1989, a statement to that effect which explainswhy the pipeline believes that continued use of those rates for that purposewould not be unjust, unreasonable or discriminatory in light of the activitiesauthorized by the blanket certificate issued in Order No. 509, and in lightof the Part 284 rates on file to implement the blanket certificate. Interestedparties may comment on these filings. Based on the pipeline's statementof explanation and the comments thereon, the Commission will determinethe appropriate action to be taken.Thus, the NOPR, Order No. 509, and this order have commenced the NGA section5 process by stating why the Commission believes the current rates areunduly discriminatory. OCS pipelines now have an opportunity to respond.If they respond, the issue will be considered on a case specific basis,with the Commission bearing the burden of demonstrating that the currentrates are unjust, unreasonable or discriminatory. The current rates willremain in effect until such time as they may be superseded by rates thatthe Commission permits or orders to become effective. In other words, OCSpipelines may file superseding rates pursuant to section 4 of the NGA,or the Commission may impose Part 284 rates as superseding rates pursuantto section 5 of the NGA. In the latter event, such rates could be imposedfor that purpose only after the Commission has considered the case specificexplanation filed by the OCS pipeline, and pursuant to a procedure wherebythe Commission has the burden of proof under section 5 of the NGA.To implement this change, andSection; 284.305 (a) and (d)(2) have been revisedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="84">andSection; 284.305</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Transportation rates.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Except to the extent authorized by paragraph (d)(2), the transportationrate for transportation of gas on the OCS by an OCS pipeline must be therate in a transportation rate schedule on file with the Commission thatconforms to andSection; 284.7, and to either andSection; 284.8(d) for firmservice or to andSection; 284.9(d) for interruptible service.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d)(2) An OCS pipeline may continue to use its current rates to performtransportation pursuant to certificates other than Part 284 blanket transportationcertificates.

Columbia is concerned thatthe Commission's statement in Order No. 509 that ``it is unduly discriminatoryto subject existing shippers on OCS pipelines to a different transportationrate than the rate charged to new shippers on the same pipeline'' \35\<NOTE/> might be read to eliminate the rate flexibility provisionsof andSection; 284.7(d). The Commission's intent in Order No. 509 was tomirror the onshore open access as closely as possible. The Commission,therefore, confirms that Order No. 509 does not preclude OCS pipelinesfrom selectively discounting Part 284 offshore transportation rates.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ <T3>See</T3> Columbia's rehearing request at 8 and Tennessee's rehearingrequest at 16.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ Order No. 509, 53 FR at 50,930, III FERC Stats. andamp;Regs. at 31,278.Tennessee requests that the Commission authorize selective discountingof its rates even if the OCS transportation service is rendered under anindividual section 7 certificate. The request is denied, consistent withwell established Commission policy.

Definition of an OCS Pipeline and Appendix B </ITAG>The Commission listed the OCS pipelines to whom blanket certificates areissued by Order No. 509 in Appendix B to the order. Several commentersnoted a number of inadvertent discrepancies between the definition of anOCS pipeline and the list of OCS pipelines in Appendix B. These commentersrequest that the Commission either clarify or revise its definition ofan OCS pipeline, or revise Appendix B to add or delete particular pipelines,so that the list will conform to the definition.\38\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ See Texas Eastern's rehearing request at 9; Black Marlin'srehearing request at 2; Transco's rehearing request at 1; FMI's rehearingrequest at 2; Amoco's rehearing request at 13; Arco's rehearing requestat 5; Indicated Producers' rehearing request at 15; NRM's request for clarificationor waiver; Texas Sea Rim's letter of January 12, 1989; and Stingray PipelineCompany's letter of January 31, 1989.  Section 284.302(b) of the regulations, as adopted in Order No. 509, definedan OCS pipeline as<ITAG tagnum="21">An interstate natural gas pipeline that holds a certificate undersection 7 of the NGA authorizing the construction and operation of facilitieson the OCS, and includes all of the OCS pipeline's facilities that fallwithin the scope of the Commission's jurisdiction under section 7 of theNGA to the full extent that such facilities are used or necessary to transportnatural gas from the OCS to the first point of interconnection on the shorewardside of the OCS where it delivers natural gas to either: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) A natural gas conditioning or processing facility, or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Another pipeline, or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) A distributor or end user of natural gas.\39\<NOTE/> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ 18 CFR 284.302(b) (1988).Black Marlin suggests that the scope of the blanket certificate could changefrom time to time whenever a particular OCS pipeline constructs a new firstpoint of interconnection on the shoreward side of the OCS. Black Marlinrequests that the Commission clarify Order No. 509 to indicate that AppendixB of the rule was provided for illustrative purposes and was not meantto establish or otherwise identify the first point of interconnection onthe shoreward side of the OCS for OCS pipelines.Texas Eastern and Transco state that there are a number of interstate pipelinefacilities on the OCS through which transportation services are performedthat were not included in Appendix B. Transco states that it owns substantialpipelines in the OCS that have been certificated under section 7 of theNGA, and is a partner in other, jointly owned OCS facilities, that arenot included in Appendix B, and that this is the case with other pipelinesas well. Transco suggests that blanket certificates are issued to thesefacilities even though they are not listed in Appendix B, and requestsclarification. Appendix B was intended as a listing of all OCS pipelines and their shorewardtermini as of the date of issuance of Order No. 509. We recognize thatOCS pipelines' shoreward termini may change subsequent to that date. Insuch event, the definition in andSection; 284.302(b), as amended below, willgovern. Appendix B will not be published in the regulations, and does notpurport to be a permanent roster of OCS pipelines. It has, however, servedan extremely useful role in the rulemaking process by focussing attentionon the formulation and application of the definition in andSection; 284.302(b).In light of the comments received, we have made a modest refinement inthe definition. We will also address herein the application of the definition,as revised, to the facts posed by several of the commenters in their requestsfor rehearing.Transco is correct that the definition of an OCS pipeline in andSection;284.302(b) is controlling. Every pipeline operating on the OCS that fallswithin that definition is issued a Part 284, Subpart G blanket transportationcertificate and must comply with Order No. 509. Offshore pipelines thatmeet the definition of an OCS pipeline in andSection; 284.302(b) (as amendedherein), but who were not listed in Appendix B of Order No. 509, fall withinthe scope of the regulations adopted in Order No. 509.\40\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ <T3>See also </T3>Texas Eastern's rehearing request at 10, where it statesthat it has ``interstate pipeline facilities on OCS lands that were constructedprimarily to connect system supplies but through which Texas Eastern alsoprovides open access transportation services to the extent that capacityis available.'' Such facilities, if they fall within the definition ofan OCS pipeline in andSection; 284.302(b), are subject to Order No. 509 despitethe fact that they were not listed in Appendix B. Black Marlin notes that its shoreward terminus is not correctly statedin Appendix B.\41\<NOTE/> Appendix B identifies the shoreward terminus of Black Marlinas the ``onshore terminus at the Union Carbide plant, Texas City, Texas.''Black Marlin states that the correct terminus is its existing interconnectionwith the Houston Pipe Line Company located at Black Marlin's onshore separationfacility, <T3>i.e., </T3>a point upstream of the Union Carbide Texas City Plant.We adopt Black Marlin's correction. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ <T3>See </T3>Black Marlin's rehearing request at 3, n.1. Stingray Pipeline Company points out that its shoreward terminus is incorrectlyidentified in Appendix B as ``West Cameron 148 Offshore Louisiana.'' \42\<NOTE/> Stingray states that the correct terminus is its compressorstation in Holly Beach, Louisiana, where it delivers gas to Natural GasPipeline Company of America. The Commission adopts that correction as well.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ See January 31, 1989 letter to the Secretary from Stingray.Arco asks the Commission to modify the definition. First, Arco explainsthat an OCS pipeline often delivers gas to a gas processing plant thathas only a single downstream exit. Arco suggests that the point of interconnectionbe moved downstream to the point at which that pipeline interconnects withanother pipeline. Arco indicates that the point of interconnection downstreamof the plant may be a few hundred feet or a few miles. In other cases,there may be more than one pipeline taking delivery of residue gas at theplant tailgate; Arco suggests that in those instances the plant inlet maybe a reasonable point for the OCS pipeline to terminate. Secondly, Arco suggests that the downstream interconnection would be moremeaningful if the onshore interconnection is with another open access pipeline;otherwise, the shipper of the gas may be unable to secure transportationof the gas to its intended destination, thus defeating the purpose of therule. Finally, Arco states that if the pipeline physically terminates atan end-use facility, then the inlet to that facility would be a reasonablepoint for the OCS pipeline to terminate. But if the end-use facility istaking delivery of only part of the gas the OCS pipeline is transporting,and isn't (or is physically incapable of) taking delivery of all of thegas, Arco believes the inlet point of the end-use facility has ``no meaning''as the termination point for the OCS pipeline because the remaining gashas no place to go except to continue in the pipeline to another pointof consumption or to an interconnection with another pipeline. Arco's solution to the three problems it perceives is to modify the definitionof an OCS pipeline to extend to the ``first point of interconnection onthe shoreward side of the OCS with another pipeline operating under theCommission's open access transportation program or which has transportationcapacity available.'' \43\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ See Arco's request for rehearing at 7. Similar to Arco, the Indicated Producers request that the definition bechanged to include all transmission facilities downstream from any pointon the OCS to the first onshore point where alternate transportation isgenuinely available. The Indicated Producers contend that this point shouldbe where the OCS shippers have access to Part 284 open access transportationfacilities that have a total capacity equal to or greater than the capacityof the OCS pipeline (after taking into account the design capacity of allPart 284 open access transportation facilities having receipt points onthe OCS pipeline).\44\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ See Indicated Producers' request for rehearing at l7.The Indicated Producers assert that the Commission was persuaded to changethe definition in the final rule by comments stating that the proposeddefinition could result in an unwarranted extension of pro rata transportationinto the onshore facilities of an OCS pipeline. Since the pro rata requirementhas been removed, the Indicated Producers believe the objection is no longerrelevant. The Indicated producers maintain that the Commission's goal to``expand open access to the OCS'' will only take on meaning if there isa true integration of transportation accessibility from the OCS to onshoreopen access facilities.\45\<NOTE/> The Indicated Producers also allege that the current definitionof an OCS pipeline may provide an unintended windfall to certain pipelinesor industrial plants and will provide opportunities to OCS pipelines (ortheir affiliated pipelines) to manipulate their systems to the detrimentof those who benefit from open access. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ <T3>Id. at 16.</T3> Arco and the Indicated Producers have raised important considerations indetermining where an OCS pipeline should terminate. However, their proposeddefinitions_to the extent that they would define the interconnection onthe shoreward side of the OCS with either another Part 284 open accesspipeline or another pipeline that has capacity available_are overly broadand exceed the Commission's legal authority under the OCSLA.As discussed below, the legal predicate for the Commission's requirementthat all OCS pipelines provide open access transportation pursuant to Part284 blanket transportation certificates is the mandate of the OCSLA. Thatmandate speaks in terms of transportation of OCS gas ``on or across'' theOCS.\46\<NOTE/> Under certain circumstances (<T3>e.g.,</T3> an essentially onshore interstate pipeline whose seawardterminus extends on to the OCS, and during periods of peak operation ofthat pipeline in a winter heating season), the definition proposed by Arcoand the Indicated Producers could extend the requirements of Order No.509 many hundreds of miles inland, deep into the interior of the continentalUnited States. Indeed, the scope of the rule's coverage might expand andcontract quite dramatically (like mercury rising and falling in a thermometer)as the availability of onshore capacity loosens and tightens; alternatively,the scope of the rule's coverage would have to extend to some predetermined``worst case scenario'' boundary line beyond which capacity would neverbe unavailable. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ 43 U.S.C. 1334(f)(1) (1982). We believe that any such extension of the scope of coverage of the rulewould significantly exceed our underlying statutory authority under theOCSLA. Based on the differences in statutory authority, the Commissionhas determined that the offshore open access program (Order No. 509) ismandatory and that the onshore open access program (Order Nos. 436 and500) is voluntary. Consequently, the Commission does not believe it can,or should, mandate onshore open access carriage under the guise of theOCSLA's offshore mandate. Thus, the Commission has chosen the first pointof interconnection off the OCS with some other entity that receives gasfrom the OCS pipeline as the terminus of the OCS open access program. To the extent that the interconnection of an open access OCS pipeline witha non-open access onshore pipeline poses problems of capacity transitionfrom one pipeline to the other, those problems are not unique to the OCS;they are the same problems that arise at the interconnection of two onshorepipelines when one is open access and the other is not. We read the OCSLAto mandate transportation of OCS gas<T3> to</T3> the onshore pipeline system, not<T3> through</T3> the onshore pipeline system. We do not read the OCSLAas mandating transportation access for OCS gas<T3> through</T3> onshore facilities in excess of, and in preference to,the transportation access that gas produced onshore has to that onshoresystem. The second problem posed by Arco, as described above_the possibility thatthe first shoreward interconnection (particularly if it is an end-user)may be physically incapable of receiving the full capacity of the OCS pipeline_doescause us some concern. We do not, however, perceive any viable method offormulating the definition to address that problem without falling intothe above described legal quagmire of trying to define the shoreward terminusof an OCS pipeline in terms of the capacity of the various shoreward entitieswith which it may from time to time interconnect, as that capacity itselfchanges seasonally or over time. We agree with Arco that if the first onshore interconnection of an OCSpipeline is with a gas conditioning or processing plant, and if that planthas only a single tailgate exit by which the gas can 1eave the plant, thepurpose of Order No. 509 would be totally frustrated if the plant blockedpassage of the gas through its tailgate facilities to the downstream interconnection.On reflection, however, it occurs to us that this potential problem isextremely hypothetical in that the plant itself would be frustrating itsown operations and economic purpose if it did anything with that gas otherthan passing it through its sole tailgate facilities to its sole interconnectionwith some entity capable of receiving it. Therefore, on the record currentlybefore us, we perceive no purpose to be served by asserting jurisdictionover such plants to the extent that they may be nonjurisdictional, or byrequiring such plants to file tariffs and conduct open seasons, etc. Ifsuch a plant ceases operation, it would, of course, cease being the terminusof the OCS pipeline. In the extremely unlikely event that a single exitplant at the terminus of an OCS pipeline remains in operation, but in sucha manner as to discriminatorily fail to redeliver its customers' gas, wewill consider an appropriate remedy on a case by case basis. FMI Hydrocarbons, Inc. (FMI) asks that the Commission revise the definitionof an OCS pipeline to include gas that is transported from an onshore locationseaward on to the OCS for consumption on the OCS. FMI, a wholly-owned subsidiaryof Freeport McMoran, Inc., arranges for supplies of natural gas to be usedto operate sulphur mines on the OCS. In connection with the operation ofthese sulphur mines, natural gas is transported by Freeport InterstatePipeline Company (Freeport Interstate) seaward into the Gulf of Mexicoand across the OCS. FMI also indicates that it may in the future seek touse offshore facilities to transport OCS gas to OCS sulphur mines,<T3> i.e.,</T3> transportation entirely on the OCS.The Commission agrees with and grants FMI's request to amend the definitionof an OCS pipeline. Section 5(f)(1)(A) of the OCSLA is concerned with the``transportation by pipeline on or across the Outer Continental Shelf ofoil or gas.'' \47\<NOTE/> The Commission interprets the words ``on or across'' theOCS to include the seaward movement of gas from either an onshore locationor an offshore location to any point on the OCS. Consequently, the Commissionmodifies the definition of an OCS pipeline in andSection; 284.302(b) of itsregulations as follows: <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ 43 U.S.C. 1334(f)(1) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="21">``OCS pipeline'' means an interstate natural gas pipeline that holdsa certificate under section 7 of the NGA authorizing the construction andoperation of facilities on the OCS, and includes all of the OCS pipeline'sfacilities that fall within the scope of the Commission's jurisdictionunder section 7 of the NGA to the full extent that such facilities areused or necessary to transport natural gas on or across the OCS between:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Any locations on the OCS (if the pipeline does not have an interconnectionoff the OCS), or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The OCS and the first point of interconnection on the shorewardside of the OCS where the pipeline delivers or receives natural gas toor from either: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) A natural gas conditioning or processing facility, or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Another pipeline, or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) A distributor or end user of natural gas.\48\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ FMI expressed concern that Freeport Interstate was listedin Appendix B and wanted the blanket certificate, but did not fit the definitionin andSection; 284.302(b). As revised, the definition now includes FreeportInterstate. Texas Sea Rim Pipeline, Inc. was listed by the Commission in Appendix Bto Order No. 509 as one of the OCS pipelines issued blanket certificatesby Order No. 509. On January 12, 1989, Texas Sea Rim sent the Commissiona letter stating that, although Order No. 509 did not provide for acceptanceor rejection of the certificates, Texas Sea Rim ``accepts the blanket certificate.''However, Texas Sea Rim's letter goes on to explain that its facilitiesare located entirely in state waters off the coast of Texas and do notcross the Federal OCS. Thus, Texas Sea Rim falls outside the definitionof an OCS pipeline in andSection; 284.302(b). If Texas Sea Rim is not anOCS pipeline, it is not subject to, or bound by, Order No. 509. As discussedabove, the definition is controlling; Appendix B was not. Therefore, theCommission finds that the issuance of a blanket certificate to Texas SeaRim in Appendix B of Order No. 509 was void <T3>ab initio. </T3>Of course, Texas Sea Rim is still a certificated interstatepipeline, can avail itself of Part 284, and has applied for a blanket certificate;\49\<NOTE/> this order is without prejudice to that application. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ Docket No. CP88-454-000. NRM Operating Company, L.P. and EnerMark, Inc.

In the alternative, NRM requests a temporary waiver of andSection;andSection;284.304-305.

NRM asserts that its delivery lineis a gathering facility exempt from the Commission's NGA jurisdiction andhas sought rehearing of the December 22, 1988 order. NRM's request forclarification or, alternatively, waiver of Order No. 509 is based on thefact that the Commission could reverse its jurisdictional determinationin that order.

Alternatively, NRM requests waiver of the regulations, pendingfinal action by the Commission on the merits of the December 22, 1988 order.NRM's request for waiver and clarification that it is not subject to OrderNo. 509 is being considered in Docket No. CP88-428, in which an order onrehearing is being issued contemporaneously. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ NRM Operating Company, L.P., <T3>et al., </T3>45 FERC andpara; 61,494 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="84">G. Open Season for Firm Transportation </ITAG>Enron seeks clarification of several aspects of the requirement for OCSpipelines to hold an open season for firm transportation. First, Enronasks whether an open season must be conducted for firm transportation ifno firm transportation capacity is available. The OCS pipeline must conductthe open season to the extent of polling all of its existing firm shippersto ascertain whether any of them want to relinquish any or all of theirfirm capacity.\51\<NOTE/> If in response to that process no firm shipper indicatesa desire to relinquish capacity, and if the OCS pipeline itself does nothave any firm capacity available for transportation services, then therewill be no firm capacity to reallocate in the open season and the openseason process is at an end; there is no need to invite potential shippersto request firm capacity that doesn't exist. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 284.304(a) (1988). Next, Enron asks the Commission to clarify that existing requests for firmservice on OCS pipelines that already have a Part 284 blanket transportationcertificate have priority over new requests made during and after the openseason.\52\<NOTE/> Enron states that some of its OCS pipelines have all theirfirm capacity fully allocated and that they have received valid requestsfor additional firm service which they cannot fulfill. Enron states thatOrder No. 509 does not address the priority status of these existing requestsduring and after the open season. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ <T3>See </T3>Enron's rehearing request at 8. Normally, the existing previously made requests for firm capacity willhave the same priority during the open season as any other request madeduring the open season's window period of 10 to 30 days; that is the essenceof an open season_everyone has an equal opportunity to request capacity.If the requests exceed availability, the OCS pipeline must allocate capacityon a pro rata basis, taking into account the capacity available at theparticular receipt and delivery points specified by both the firm shippersrelinquishing capacity and the shippers requesting firm capacity.\53\<NOTE/> Thereafter, requests for firm capacity will be treated pursuantto the pipeline's tariffs.\54\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 284.304(a)(4) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ <T3>See </T3>18 CFR 284.305(e) (1988). However, we recognize that some OCS pipelines already hold Part 284 blankettransportation certificates, and have tariffs on file that conform to therequirements of Part 284. If such OCS pipelines have compiled a list ofpotential shippers who want firm capacity, and if such a list was compiledin a nondiscriminatory manner pursuant to the conditions of an order issuinga Part 284 certificate or pursuant to the provisions of a tariff filedto implement Part 284 requirements, the pipeline should accord priorityto those potential shippers at the open season. In other words, we do notwish to disrupt the orderly operation of a nondiscriminatory allocationmechanism that an open access OCS pipeline has already implemented pursuantto Part 284. Accordingly, we are adding a new paragraph (iv) to andSection;284.304(a)(4):<ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) If an OCS pipeline already has a list of potential shippers whowant firm capacity, and if that list was compiled in a nondiscriminatorymanner pursuant to the conditions of an order issuing a Part 284 blanketcertificate or pursuant to the provisions of a tariff filed to implementPart 284 requirements, it shall accord priority to those potential firmshippers at the open season.</ITAG>Third, Enron seeks rehearing or clarification that after the open seasonan existing firm shipper cannot circumvent a pipeline's waiting list forfirm capacity by assignment of the released capacity to a third party.Enron asserts that Order No. 509 does not address the situation after anopen season where an OCS pipeline (1) has all of its capacity fully allocated,(2) has remaining unfulfilled requests for firm service, and (3) has anexisting shipper who desires to relinquish service. Enron argues that itwould be inequitable to permit the existing shipper who wants to relinquishcapacity to circumvent the process by assigning capacity to a third party.Enron suggests that the existing shipper first should be required to relinquishcapacity to those parties who are first in line for service. Enron suggeststhat only when there are no existing requests or not enough requests toaccount for the total capacity to be released should an existing shipperbe permitted to reassign its capacity to a party of its choosing. The Commission agrees with Enron that an existing shipper should not beable to circumvent an OCS pipeline's priority queue or waiting list byassignment of released capacity to a third party, as long as such a priorityqueue or waiting list has been established by the pipeline through nondiscriminatoryprocesses consistent with the requirements of Part 284. Order No. 509 contemplatesthat a potential firm shipper may take the initiative to find an existingfirm shipper who wishes to relinquish capacity. However, the reallocationof that capacity must be made by the pipeline itself, and cannot be madeby the shippers; a direct shipper-to-shipper transfer of capacity wouldconstitute unauthorized capacity brokering.\55\<NOTE/> Moreover, the  reallocation must be consistent with the pipeline'stariff provisions implementing andSection; 284.305(e), which requires OCSpipelines to set forth in their tariffs the mechanism they will use toreallocate firm transportation capacity under andSection; 284.304(c). Thus,Enron has the ability to provide itself with the clarification it seeks.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ Cf. United Gas Pipeline Company, 46 FERC andpara; 61,060(Jan. 24, 1989), Order Amending Blanket Certificate. Finally, Enron states that if an OCS pipeline has firm uncommitted capacity,the pipeline should be able to allocate that uncommitted capacity to ashipper requesting such service prior to relinquishment and allocationof committed capacity. The Commission agrees with Enron and believes thatthis procedure is already established in andSection; 284.304 (a)(4)(ii) and(c)(2). <ITAG tagnum="84">H. Open Season for Interruptible Transportation </ITAG>Texas Eastern and Tennessee accuse the Commission of allowing interruptiblecapacity to be allocated, rather than scheduled, on the basis of price.\56\<NOTE/> Consistent with the Commission's intent to mirror the onshoreopen access program, it stated that after the open season has been conductedan OCS pipeline may allocate interruptible capacity using any nondiscriminatorymeans that is acceptable for onshore blanket certificate transportation.In making that allocation, the Commission required OCS pipelines to givepriority to currently authorized interruptible transportation so as toavoid disrupting on-going certificated service. This priority is contingentupon  the rates that the existing shippers pay being no lower than therates paid or to be paid by other interruptible shippers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ <T3>See </T3>Texas Eastern's rehearing request at 11; and Tennessee's rehearingrequest at 8. Tennessee and Texas Eastern claim that Order No. 509 allows capacity tobe allocated on the basis of price. Tennessee asserts that Order No. 509confuses capacity allocation with the scheduling of service and that thisis inconsistent with the existing Commission policy on open access service.Tennessee declares that the Commission has uniformly required open accesspipelines to allocate interruptible capacity on a first-income, first-servedbasis, with priority accorded to shippers who request service first.

However, in contrast to ANR, Pennzoil believes that the replacementshipper should be able to seek a term for firm transportation capacitythat is shorter than the contract term of the shipper relinquishing thecapacity. Pennzoil postulates an example where an existing shipper wantsto relinquish 50 percent of its firm transportation capacity for the remainingperiod of its contract with an OCS pipeline, <T3>e.g.,</T3> ten years. If the potential replacement shipper wants thecapacity for only one year, Pennzoil interprets Order No. 509 as requiringthe OCS pipeline to relinquish 50 percent of its capacity to the replacementshipper for one year. For the remaining term of the contract, <T3>i.e.,</T3> nine years, the capacity would remain committed to the existingshipper. Pennzoil bases its interpretation on the assertion that the pipelineshould not be given the discretion to impose a term on the transportationagreement that the new shipper seeks because the pipeline could use thisdiscretion to discriminate against a potential shipper.The Commission grants ANR's request for clarification and denies Pennzoil's.The Commission's intent in Order No. 509 was to have the voluntary reallocationstructured in such a way that the OCS pipeline was indifferent to the ``substitution''of the two shippers.\6\\0\<NOTE/> Consequently, the replacement shipper must be willing toassume all of the obligations of the original shipper. In response to Pennzoil,we reiterate and stress what we said in Order No. 509. The reallocationof firm capacity is total and permanent. The relinquishing shipper doesnot retain any residual rights to it. The relinquishing shipper gives upthe capacity for its full term, and the new firm shipper accepts that capacityfor its full term (unless the OCS pipeline itself voluntarily chooses topermit a shorter term and itself retains or reallocates the remainder).A request for firm capacity for less than the full term of that capacityis not a valid request, and need not be honored. The capacity reallocationprovisions under the rule are, in that respect, quite different and distinctfrom ``capacity brokering.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\0\ Order No. 509, 53 FR at 50,929, n. 26, III FERC Stats.andamp; Regs. at 31,276, n. 26.<ITAG tagnum="84">J. Abandonment</ITAG>Transco seeks clarification of whether the abandonment authority in andSection;284.304(c)(3) pertains to the entire preexisting transportation agreementor only to that portion of the arrangement which occurs offshore and upto the first point of interconnection as defined in andSection; 284.302(b).Transco believes that the relinquishment, abandonment and reallocationprocedures should apply to the preexisting transportation arrangement.Transco asserts that if that is not the case, the abandonment authoritywould be meaningless because (1) most transportation arrangements providefor the delivery of gas past the first point of interconnection onshore,and (2) separate abandonment applications will be required for that portionof the arrangement beyond the first point of interconnection off the OCS.In support of its request, Transco contends that the Commission has theauthority to extend the automatic abandonment provisions of Order No. 509to the onshore portions of transportation arrangements under section 7(b)of the NGA, and that the NGA does not distinguish between onshore and offshorefacilities.While Transco raises valid considerations, the Commission declines to adoptTransco's suggestion at this time. First, as noted in several differentcontexts in this order, the Commission is reluctant to have any part ofOrder No. 509 or the OCSLA govern the transportation of natural gas ininterstate commerce onshore. Second, not all OCS pipelines are in Transco'sposition; some OCS pipelines that have onshore facilities are not openaccess pipelines under Part 284; it would be particularly inappropriateto grant abandonment authority that extends to the onshore operation ofnon-open access pipelines. Third, most OCS pipelines have offshore or closeto shore termination points such that the abandonment authority in andSection;284.304(c)(3) is adequate to promote voluntary reallocation of firm capacity.The Commission agrees with Transco that separate abandonment applicationsmay be necessary in certain cases to complete the voluntary reallocationof firm capacity; the Commission will endeavor to process such applicationsexpeditiously.AGD argues that the Commission's grant of blanket abandonment authorizationfor previously certificated firm service is legally invalid because theCommission has failed to make the requisite finding under section 7(b)of the NGA that the abandonment is consistent with the public convenienceand necessity. AGD asserts that section 7(b) ``clearly requires that abandonmentbe premised upon a `finding <T3>by the Commission</T3>,' after due hearing.'' AGD argues that therecan be no such finding on the record before the Commission and that thequestion of whether the abandonment of transportation services would servethe present or future public convenience and necessity is an ``extraordinarilyfact-specific question'' that merits careful scrutiny.\6\\1\<NOTE/> AGD argues that there is an utter absence of record supportfrom which the Commission could make such a determination now.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\1\ AGD's rehearing request at 4.As discussed in Order No. 509, the hearing requirement in the NGA can,under appropriate circumstances, be satisfied through the notice and commentprocedures of a rulemaking.\6\\2\<NOTE/> Both the NOPR and Order No. 509 discussed the importanceof making the most efficient use of the capacity of OCS pipelines.

Based on these considerations, elaborated in the NOPR,the comments received in response to the NOPR, and Order No. 509, the Commissionfinds, pursuant to section 7(b) of the NGA, that the abandonment of firmtransportation service that a shipper does not want is consistent withthe public convenience and necessity.

Enron states that the March 1, 1989 deadlinedoes not provide enough time to set up the administrative mechanisms necessaryto conduct the open season in an efficient and orderly manner. Enron assertsthat this is particularly true for those pipelines that did not previouslyoperate on an open access basis offshore. Finally, Enron suggests thatthe March 1, 1989 deadline is also inadequate from a shipper's perspectivebecause it leaves little time to line up necessary gas supplies and markets. Enron's request is denied. Order No. 509 was issued on December 9, 1988.Enron has had ample opportunity to set up the relatively simple mechanismsnecessary to conduct the open seasons; basically, those mechanisms consistof communicating with its customers and potential customers. The potentialshippers also have had adequate opportunity to formulate their plans. The Indicated Producers express concern that prospective shippers willnot have sufficient information to request capacity in an open season unlessthe open season is delayed:<ITAG tagnum="21">Because of the timing of the exclusive open season, prospective firmshippers may be compelled to decide whether to request firm capacity onpipelines that do not have existing applicable tariffs without knowinghow much that capacity will ultimately cost.

But, on the other hand, delay in holdingthe open seasons may deprive other shippers of an opportunity to obtaincapacity that they currently need and want. Information is relative, andno particular point in time is perfect for everyone. On balance, we believethat the potential harm inherent in delaying the reallocation of capacityfor those who seek such reallocation outweighs the potential benefit tobe gained by delaying the open seasons.  In this regard, the open seasons do not constitute a one-time cataclysmicreallocation of capacity that will be locked in concrete forever after.On the contrary, the open seasons are merely a starting point for pipelinesand shippers to gain information on who needs and wants capacity, and onwhat capacity is available.

I invitethe attention of interested parties to my Concurring Opinion issued withOrder No. 509, the Final Rule in these dockets ( 45 FERC andpara; 61,406).Each of my reservations is discussed in more detail in the earlier opinion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">First, I would have preferred strongly to grant rehearing as soughtby the Indicated Producers and others on the issues of (1) a priority forcasinghead gas, (2) application of the Order No. 500 take-or-pay creditingmechanism, and (3) the definition of an OCS pipeline to include assuredaccess to nondiscriminatory transportation ashore. The rehearing petitionsadded additional, persuasive argumentation to the concerns expressed inmy earlier opinion in support of granting rehearing. Consequently, theCommission should have more adequately responded to those issues.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Second, I would have deferred the initiation of the open seasons forcapacity allocation from April 1, 1989, for at least one month, if notlonger, as sought by the Indicated Producers. I am pleased that the Commissionagreed to a one month delay. But, I still do not believe that potentialshippers will have adequate information about rates on which to base theirnominations. It is difficult to conclude that the rate cases for all OCSpipelines, particularly those filing to continue existing rates under thenew procedures in this order, will be completed by April, when shippersmust make their nominations. There also does not appear to be any demonstrabledisadvantage to a further, modest delay to better ensure a more orderlyprocess, while still having the new system in place and operational bythe winter heating season of 1989-1990.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Third, I would have preferred to expressly grant the requests forrehearing of Texas Eastern and Tennessee with regard to the open seasonfor interruptible transportation (slip opinion at 37-39). Tennessee andTexas Eastern did not ``misread'' Order No. 509, as the order concludes.As my earlier concurring opinion demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt(pages 8 and 9 of the opinion), the priority to be afforded existing shipperswas subordinated in Order No. 509 to a requirement in the regulations (sec.284.304(b)) that such shippers pay transportation rates'' no lower thanthe rates paid or to be paid by other interruptible shippers.'' Footnote24 of that order makes the intended result quite clear. The ``clarification''here at page 39 is intended to resolve the matter, as I was assured bythe staff at the February 15, 1989, Commission meeting, but without directlygranting rehearing. I strongly support the result of that clarification,and it should now be abundantly clear that existing shippers have an unsubordinatedand unconditional right to a priority. Consequently, despite the relativetechnicality as to whether Tennessee and Texas Eastern misread Order No.509 and, thereby, clarification or rehearing is most appropriate, the regulatoryresult is unambiguously clear_existing shippers must be given priorityin the open season for interruptible transportation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, I questioned seriously the rationale and justification supportingOrder No. 509 and its mandatory imposition of Order No. 436 blanket certificateson all jurisdictional OCS pipelines for the reasons discussed in my earlieropinion. I also expressed deep concern about the potential for disruptionin OCS pipeline transportation services under the implementation proceduresof the Final Rule. The rehearing petitions and the adjustments in the instantorder have addressed those questions and concerns to some extent. On balance,therefore, I am prepared to support this Order on Rehearing despite somelingering questions and concerns about those issues, as well as the aforementionedreservations. In all likelihood, a reviewing U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsultimately will determine the legality of the mandatory imposition of theblanket certificates and the form of the certificates. In the meantime,hopefully, mandatory open access transportation services will be implementedacross all jurisdictional OCS pipelines this spring with no interruptionof existing services and minimum disruption of OCS production activitiesin the months ahead.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For these reasons, I concur.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Charles A.
