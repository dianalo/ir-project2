The new vice president's trip to Venezuela and El Salvador willbe his first chance to perform on the international stage since hiselevation from junior senator from Indiana.   Twenty-two heads of states are expected to be with Quayle inCaracas on Thursday for the inauguration of Carlos Andres Perez aspresident.   The lineup is expected to include presidents of the five CentralAmerican countries and of the principle Latin debtor nations.Together, they could present a uniform front on the question of howthe poor nations will handle their huge international debts.   Quayle is expected to conduct bilateral meetings with about 10 ofthe presidents, including at least one or two from Central Americaand up to five from South America, said an administration officialclose to the planning of Quayle's trip.   Among those expected to be present he will not meet with: Cuba'sFidel Castro and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega.   Also expected for the inauguration are Alfredo Cesar and otherrepresentatives of the U.S.-backed Contra rebels, who are hoping topush the other Central American presidents to demand democratizationin Nicaragua.   Venezuela's biggest inauguration ever will mostly present aprotocol challenge for Quayle, said a U.S. official.   How he presents himself and the style with which he representsthe United States will be as much a measure of his success asanything, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.   ``It is important symbolically in that it is one of the moreimportant meetings of Latin American leaders in the last 10 years,''the official said.   Quayle, whose chief legislative accomplishment was a job-trainingbill, has been closeted in hours of briefings with State Departmentand National Security Council officials and others familiar with theregion.   He was described by one of the briefers as energetic and eager tocarry out the trip with accomplishment.   Among those with whom he has met are AFL-CIO officials who areconcerned about human rights in El Salvador, said Quayle's presssecretary, David Beckwith.   In El Salvador, he will meet with outgoing President JoseNapoleon Duarte and with other political and military figures,including representatives of Duarte's Christian Democratic Party andthe rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or ARENA, party.   El Salvador, in the stranglehold of a guerrilla war against theU.S.-backed government for the past nine years, holds electionsMarch 19. Duarte cannot run again and ARENA's Alfredo Cristiani ledChristian Democratic candidate Fidel Chavez Mena in recent polls.   Some U.S. officials have expressed concern that a victory byCristiani could further polarize the war-torn country and createstumbling blocks in Congress for getting new aid to the regionpassed.   Quayle's El Salvador visit comes at a volatile time. Duarterecently rejected a proposal by the rebels in which the rebelsoffered to take part in the elections and drop their longstandingdemand for power sharing in a transitional government if theelections were postponed to September.   Officials said no diplomatic breakthroughs would be expected ofQuayle, but that his mission would be to show Bush administrationconcern for the region's economic and social problems.   ``The trip is mainly to show our interest in the area and showour interest in democracy,'' said Beckwith.   It is also a chance for Quayle to meet the challenge of criticswho during the presidential campaign claimed he was not up to thejob of vice president.   Quayle is not scheduled to make any speeches during the trip butwill hold press conferences.   Beyond Quayle's personal performance, the trip puts a spotlighton Latin America as a region the Bush administration considersimportant and world leaders will be watching to see what they canexpect in the way of policy from Bush.   ``They're all waiting with baited breath to see what signals hewill send,'' on such issues as the debt crisis and the Contra war inNicaragua, said one administration official.   Riddled by massive debt and internal economic disarray, many ofthe Latin countries are also plagued by insurgent movements.   Among them, rebel forces have been entrenched in El Salvador andGuatemala for years, while guerrilla activity by the radical ShiningPath in Peru also has stepped up.   Latin American countries owe more than $440 billion of the $1.3trillion of Third World debt. Brazil, Mexico and Argentina are thebiggest Third World debtors, with much of the money owed to U.S.banks.   Perez, along with Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gotari,have been in the forefront of urging relief from the debt burdenthat has resulted in net payments of $20 billion to $30 billion ayear from poor countries to richer ones.   But no definitive policy on Central American debt or the Contrawar has been outlined by the Bush administration.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, as treasury secretary in1985, proposed $29 billion in new loans to Third World countriesthat demonstrate economic reform, but banks did not embrace theproposal and not much came of it.   Baker said during his recent Senate confirmation hearing that theBush administration will undertake a full review of the debtsituation.   Baker also signalled the Bush administration's leanings onNicaragua, vowing support for the Contras and calling for abipartisan Central American policy. He called for human rightsprotection in Nicaragua as well as El Salvador and other countriesin the region.   The Central American presidents are expected to emerge fromCaracas with a date to resume their talks to further the regionalpeace plan offered by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.</TEXT></DOC>
