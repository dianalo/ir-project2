In this paper, the composition of LBO particlesis experimentally clarified. It was found that the LBO particles ejectedfrom an aluminum thin film were composed of clusters and vaper atoms.For the laser intensity of 4 x 10/sup 11/W/m/sup 2/, the total volumeof the clusters was estimated to be roughly a quarter of the LBO particlesand the average diameter of the cluster was 20 nm.</TEXT></DOC>
