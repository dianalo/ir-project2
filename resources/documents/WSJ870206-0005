Stocks advanced across the board, and many hit new highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 2000.    But even in January's bull market, some stocks stand out for rising sharply on heavy volume -- shortly before a major disclosure.    Mere coincidence? A sign that inside information was leaked? Perhaps information obtained by another means? That rarely is answered.    While instances of suspicious trading are common, proving illegal insider trading is another thing. The New York Stock Exchange alone, using computers that flag &quot;unusual price moves,&quot; detected 165 cases last year that weren't readily explained, says Agnes Gautier, vice president for surveillance at the exchange. About 60 of them, she adds, were deemed strong enough to refer to the Securities and Exchange Commission for investigation. In most cases, no action resulted.    The exchanges and the SEC say they don't disclose what stock trading is under current investigation.    Unusual stock movement, of course, isn't in itself evidence that illegal activity occurred. Some rumors are just that, and sometimes rumor proves juicier than fact, which can result in a price decline once the facts are known.    Even when insider trading is strongly suspected, building a case is difficult. Notes Ms. Gautier, &quot;The big question is, how do you prove insider trading? Sometimes the evidence is all very circumstantial. . . . People say they bought on rumors. It's tough.&quot;    Some market watchers say that suspicious trading on inside-information leaks has declined as a result of the SEC's celebrated insider-trading cases against the arbitrager Ivan Boesky and investment banker Dennis Levine.    But, as a look at the January performance of some stocks shows, unusual stock movement hasn't disappeared.    Hal Roach Studios   On Friday, Jan. 2, Hal Roach Studios Inc.'s stock closed at $7.625, up 12 1/2 cents, in national over-the-counter trading. The following Monday, the price jumped $2 -- a 26% increase -- before the entertainment company requested a halt in trading. &quot;You halt trading any time you have a pending material announcement,&quot; said Jonathan Lloyd, senior vice president of finance.    On Tuesday, the company said it had signed a letter of intent with Qintex America Ltd., a unit of an Australian investment concern, for Qintex to buy 41% of Hal Roach Studios for $7 a share, or a total of $33.6 million.    Mr. Lloyd said he wasn't aware of any connection between the stock activity Monday and the announcement Tuesday.    ICN Pharmaceuticals   On Wednesday, Jan. 7, ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. stock rose 10.6% to $22.125, up $2.125, in NYSE composite trading. Volume was 682,800, nearly triple the previous day's. During the day, the company invited securities analysts to a meeting the following week. The next afternoon the company said that it would hold a news conference on Friday to discuss clinical trials of its Virazole drug, which was being tested for treating Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. The stock closed at $25.25 on volume of 1.4 million shares.    On Friday, ICN released preliminary data suggesting that the drug was effective in treating an early form of infection with the AIDS virus. ICN's stock dropped $4 a share that day, apparently because investors had expected even better news. ICN wouldn't comment about the company's stock price.    Golden Nugget   On Tuesday, Jan. 13, Golden Nugget Inc.'s stock closed at $10.25 a share in NYSE composite trading. Over the next three days, the stock rose 16%, closing at $11.875 on Friday. Trading volume those three days was more than 1.6 million shares, the highest three-day total in more than six months.    Over the weekend, Golden Nugget said it had agreed to sell its Atlantic City casino and some nearby land to Bally Manufacturing Corp. for $140 million in cash and stock; Bally also agreed to assume a $299 million mortgage.    Golden Nugget's stock rose to $12 on the following Monday; the deal was considered favorable for it. But it dropped to $10.75 the next day after Bally announced an agreement with Donald Trump, the real-estate developer, to delay its transaction with Golden Nugget. (Mr. Trump owns a 9.9% stake in Bally and is considering buying the company, and Bally's agreement to buy the Golden Nugget casino is widely perceived as an effort to fend off Mr. Trump.)    Golden Nugget executives didn't return phone calls seeking comment on the price rise before the initial announcement.    Bird Inc.   Also on Jan. 13, 416,500 shares of Bird Inc., a maker of building materials and machinery, were traded -- more shares in a single day than any monthly total since February 1986. The stock closed unchanged at $9.125 in national over-the-counter trading. Over the next two trading days, the price rose $1.25 -- nearly 14%.    On Friday, Entwistle Co., a machinery maker and defense contractor, said it owned an 11.4% stake in Bird and &quot;may purchase up to 24% of the stock&quot; for investment purposes. Even taking into account Entwistle's purchases, volume in Bird stock was far higher than usual.    Entwistle officials didn't return phone calls seeking comment, and a Bird spokesman said he didn't know of any reason for the unusual activity other than Entwistle's purchases.    Telerate   On Wednesday, Jan. 14, Telerate Inc. stock closed at $31 a share, up $1.25, on the Big Board, on volume of 185,530 shares, more than double the volume of the day before and higher than most days. The company said it knew of no reason for the activity. The next day Telerate's shares rose $1.125 -- a two-day gain of 8% -- on even heavier volume.    After the market closed, Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of this newspaper, announced that it had agreed to acquire more than 4.4 million shares of Telerate from Oklahoma Publishing Co. for $30 a share, increasing its stake to 44.8%.    Spokesmen for Telerate and Dow Jones said they weren't aware of any leaks. &quot;If a leak did in fact occur, there's no way I could describe to you how or when it happened,&quot; the Telerate spokesman added.    American Aggregates   On Jan. 19, stock of American Aggregates Corp., a mining and processing company, closed at $19 a share in national over-the-counter trading for the fifth consecutive day.    Over the next four trading days the stock rose $5.50 a share, or 29%. On the following Monday morning the company said it had agreed to be acquired for $30.625 a share by a unit of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, a British mining company.    David Feltman, American Aggregates secretary, says he knew of no rumors about the impending takeover. He says the stock price may have risen because several months earlier the company predicted a record quarter and promised to consider increasing the dividend.    Westburne International   On Tuesday, Jan. 20, a total of 10,580 shares of Westburne International Industries Ltd., a Canadian company that mainly sells construction equipment, traded on the American, Toronto and Montreal stock exchanges. On the Amex, the stock closed unchanged at $12.50 (U.S.) a share.    The next day 190,100 Westburne's shares traded on the three exchanges, closing at $13 a share on the Amex. Wednesday's volume on the Amex alone was 106,400 shares -- more than was traded in all of December on the exchange.    After the market closed on Wednesday, Westburne said it was discussing a possible takeover at a &quot;premium&quot; over the current market price. It made the announcement &quot;in response to inquiries relating to high trading volume.&quot; On Jan. 29, the company announced that Dumez S.A. of Paris and Unicorp Canada Corp. would make a tender offer for Westburne shares at the equivalent of about $15 U.S. a share.    First United Financial   On Thursday, Jan. 22, shares of First United Financial Services Inc., an Arlington Heights, Ill., bank, closed unchanged at $14 a share bid on volume of 6,800 shares in national over-the-counter trading. The next day, 50,000 shares changed hands and the stock closed at $15 a share bid. On the following Monday the price rose another $1 -- up 14% in two trading days -- on volume of 22,300 shares.    Before the market opened Tuesday, the company said it had agreed in principle to be acquired by First Chicago Corp. for $20.83 a share. First United said it had planned to wait until a definitive agreement was signed before announcing the acquistion, but went ahead because of the heavy trading and continuing rise in its share price. &quot;We thought perhaps there was some leakage -- certainly not from our end,&quot; says Stephen Daniels, director of finance at First United. A First Chicago spokesman said the company had no knowlege of any leaks.    Quincy Cooperative Bank   On Friday, Jan. 2, shares of Quincy (Mass.) Co-operative Bank closed at $16 a share bid in national over-the-counter trading. A week later, it closed at $18.25. By the end of the following week the price had risen to $23.375, and a week later it was $25.50. Daily volume was two to three times normal for much of the period.    On Wednesday, Jan. 28, Co-operative Bancorp. of Concord, Mass., said it had agreed to acquire Quincy Co-operative for $30 a share.    Leo Sheehan, a vice president of Quincy Co-operative, says the shares of many Massachusetts savings banks rose during January because of takeover speculation. James E. Moynihan Jr., a bank analyst at Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook andamp; Weeden Inc., who keeps an index of Massachusetts thrift stocks, notes that the percentage increase in Quincy Co-operative's shares was twice as high as the average before the takeover was announced. He adds that there were rumors all month about a bid for Quincy Co-operative.    Was there a leak? &quot;I don't think so,&quot; says Mr. Sheehan. </TEXT></DOC>
