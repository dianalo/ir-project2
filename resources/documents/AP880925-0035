(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There's no such thing as a mess hall intoday's military, it's now an enlisted dining facility. TheC-ration is also gone, replaced by the less lyrical MRE, short formeal ready to eat.   These changes, and others, are constantly being orchestrated bythe U.S. Army's Research and Development Laboratories, assigned todevelop food for all the armed forces among other tasks.   One of the latest items for GI menus is an all-natural breadwith a shelf life of three years. And Tabasco sauce is now arequired condiment for every fighting man and woman.   Army scientists and engineers develop food, clothing, shelterand airdrop equipment in the labs that are spread out on the78-acre base about 20 miles south of Boston. But much attention ispaid to planning the continually evolving menus, or what scientistscall ``future feeding concepts.''   Civilians might call most of the food ``take-out.'' The majorityis designed for soldiers in combat and must last for three years.   ``The conception of how war needs to be fought changes, and whenthe military rethinks how it's going to fight, we need to rethinkfood,'' said Phil Brandler, acting director of food engineering atthe base.   MREs replaced the well-known C-rations in 1981. The heaviercanned items that were part of the lore of World War II and theKorean and Vietnam wars were dropped in favor of a lightweight``meal in a pouch,'' much of which can be reconstituted in thefield.   ``The modern battlefield is more mobile, it makes (the men)harder to find and get to, and they go off for days at a time,''said Brandler. ``They have to be provided with foodstuffs of lowvolume that can be carried around for awhile.''   Army chefs are also mindful that soldiers ought to like whatthey eat, or at least tolerate it.   ``Tastes change,'' said Brandler. ``Food that we developed forthe Korean and Vietnam war no longer is always acceptable.''   Part of that, according to Brandler, is that the ethnic makeupof the Army has changed over the years.   ``We have a higher percentage of Vietnamese and Orientals,'' hesaid. ``Our troops want spicier foods.'' Hence the tiny bottles ofTabasco sauce that surface in each MRE.   ``Loss of acceptance'' is the term given food items scorned bysoldiers in periodic taste tests, according to Army food specialistSue Gagner.   Among the food that's been dropped are lima beans, ham andchicken loaf, three-bean salad and fruitcake. Beef stew is on theway out. After soldiers complained that omelettes were too``dense,'' they were promptly ``reformulated.''   The first of Army rations was established by Congressionalresolution on Nov. 4, 1775.   Those daily rations consisted of either beef, pork or salt fish,accompanied by bread or flour, three pints of peas or beans, onepint of milk, one pint of Indian meal, one quart of spruce beer anda portion of molasses.   These days, along with one of 12 different entrees such aschicken a la king or tuna with noodles, soldiers are allottedcrackers with cheese spread, freeze-dried fruit, candy, cookies orcake, instant coffee or tea and powders that turn intofruit-flavored drinks.   Most popular foods in the MREs are spaghetti and meatballs, thedried strawberries (just add water) and bags of brand-name candy.   The food is surprisingly palatable and can be heated up inminutes.   It's relative tastiness is all the more surprising given theambitious shelf life requirements for combat food. Because foodmust be warehoused for long periods and be available for immediateshipment to hot spots, the Army has developed the bread that stilltastes pretty good after a few years.   The bread is new and the result of recent technology developedat the base. No preservatives or chemicals are used; instead, it isbaked with a combination of ingredients designed to slow the growthof microbes.   You may not find it served at Maxim's any time soon, but thebread has enjoyed ``good acceptance'' among soldiers. And thatsuits its creators just fine.   Even after three years, according to Gerald Schulz, associatedirector of food engineering, ``they would not be repulsed by it.''</TEXT></DOC>
