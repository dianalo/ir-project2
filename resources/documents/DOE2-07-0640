A micro computer is used to predictthe 'equivalent external temperature' profile representing the thermaltime lag and damping effects due to capacitance. Internally the temperatureeffect of incidental or casual gain together with useful solar inputis represented by the 'base temperature' concept related to demand temperaturesat the upper and lower limits of a comfort band. Results show that asmall winter heating load can be met with an intermittently operatedtraditional heating system whereas a significant residual cooling loadis left taking into account maximum available shading measures. In orderto meet this load passively when external temperatures are above maximuminternal comfort limits, a method of introducing cooled ventilation airvia wind towers in conjunction with atria spaces appears to have potential.</TEXT></DOC>
