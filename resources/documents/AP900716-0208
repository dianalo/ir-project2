Tom Jorjorian, manager of the Nahigian Brothers cleaning plant,says an Oriental rug can last ``forever.'' He offers these tips toowners:   _ Turn your rugs every year to equalize traffic wear and lightexposure.   _ Be sure the rug has padding to reduce wear and inhibitslippage. Pads also add ``sumptuousness,'' he says.   _ Vaccuum the rugs in the direction of the nap, which you candetermine by running your hand over the surface.   _ Sweep fringes with a broom instead of vacuuming, which canbreak them.   _ Do not beat your rug. That can break the foundation.   _ Broom sweeping not only removes loose dirt but helps bring outthe wool's natural sheen.   _ Never put a house plant or flower pot on the rug. No matterhow careful you are, moisture can penetrate or condense on the rug,creating permanent mildew damage.   _ Mop up spills by blotting, not rubbing. Dilute the spillagewith plenty of cool water and continue blotting until the rugappears to be clean. Try not to soak unaffected parts. Drythoroughly, first using absorbent towels on top and underneath,then turning the rug over to dry the foundation. Finally, turn itupright to finish drying.   _ If spills have dried, get the advice of an experienced rugcleaner.   _ Don't use steam cleaners or chemicals. These can prematurelyage the rug by removing the wool's natural oils.   _ Inspect your rug every few months, looking for wear at theedges and ends. Check the back for moth damage, which will appearas areas of missing knots, even though the cotton foundationremains.   _ Store Oriental rugs not in use where they will be safe fromexcess humidity, heat and moths. Have them mothproof-sprayed by aprofessional or pack them with moth crystals if they are to bestored for any length of time.   _ Roll, do not fold, for storage.   _ Be wary of over-the-counter stain removers. They may not beright for your kind of rug and may cause permanent damage.   Nahigian Brothers maintains a hotline 1 (800) 543-7888, toanswer consumer information about Oriental rug care.
