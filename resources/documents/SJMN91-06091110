But Hiroshi Fujishige wishes that time hadstopped around 1955.;    Having resisted countless multimillion-dollar offersfor the 58-acre farm, now shadowed by gleaming high-rises, Fujishige holds oneof the largest undeveloped prime tracts in the city.;    Now, he finds himselfin the path of a giant developer: the Walt Disney Co., which is seeking a sitefor a possible third Disney attraction in the area.;    Motives only guessedat;  Some say the Fujishiges are merely holding out for the right price. Butmany more say they are holding on to a philosophy that the family land issacred.;    &quot;He has an Oriental omniscience about him,&quot; said one man close tothe family, describing Hiroshi Fujishige, 68. &quot;Some say he's crazy, becausehe's sitting on property worth between $60 million and $70 million, watchinghis strawberries grow. I think he knows something we don't know.&quot;;    In manyways, the Fujishiges represent a common struggle to tame powerful developmentinterests. But the suicide of Fujishige's brother in 1986 during the family'sfight to prevent the city from building roads through the property has otherlandowners and city officials drawing mystical comparisons this time.;   Among the locals, the suicide is so closely tied to the family's hold on theproperty that one Anaheim official said the city is no longer interested inthe property.;    But Disney is getting closer. Neighboring property owners,after lifetimes of running tiny inns, restaurants and trailer parks, arehappily walking away with Disney's millions in moves that are sure to changeAnaheim's landscape once again.;    Neighbor got $30 million;  Last month,Disney paid $30.2 million for a 23-acre former mobile home park across fromDisneyland and bordering the Fujishige strawberry field.;    Fujishige saidthat he, too, has been approached by Disney, which was seeking a long-termlease on the farm.;    The preliminary offer, reportedly worth $32 million fora 99-year lease, was rejected by Fujishige as &quot;insulting.&quot;;    &quot;It sure seemedto me that I was about to end up like those Indians who used to own ManhattanIsland,&quot; the farmer said last month.;    In recent weeks, sources say,negotiations have been continuing.;    One prospective buyer drove to the farmrecently with a proposal worth $2 million per acre.;    &quot;I didn't even get hisname,&quot; Fujishige said matter-of-factly. &quot;This land means quite a bit to me. Mybrother died for it.&quot;;    But Fujishige has acknowledged that he may have tosell his property.;    &quot;It's home,&quot; he said. &quot;But I could see where I may haveto move, maybe in three, four or five years. I'm happy doing what I'm doing,that's all I know.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Anaheim  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910331  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  535  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday March 31, 199100091110,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
