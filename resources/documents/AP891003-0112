Gorbachev's proposal for a complete ban.   Gorbachev said he was satisfied with the compromise, and that itwould ``help restore a normal life.''   ``This is a decision in support of perestroika,'' he said.   A day after hearing Gorbachev's proposal to ban all strikes forthe next 15 months, a joint session of the Supreme Soviet's twochambers spent all of today in confused debate before arriving at aweakened version.   In the end, it approved by a vote of 364-6 a temporary ban onstrikes in the industries of transport, energy, metallurgy and allraw materials until it can approve full legislation governingstrikes.   A detailed law regulating strikes may be ready as soon as nextweek.   A draft law bans strikes that could threaten the lives or healthof people, and also in transportation, communications, energy,defense industries and government organs. However, many of the keyissues in the draft have not yet been approved.   Gorbachev repeated his warning that the Soviet economy isthreatened by waves of politically motivated job actions, but didnot call again for an outright ban on all strikes.   Deputies included in their decision language that would allowthe country's ministries of interior, defense and transport to takeover railroads in Armenia and Azerbaijan if necessary to get railtraffic moving again to Armenia.   Earlier, during a break in the debate, Interior Ministery VadimBakatin called the proposed strike ban unconstitutional.   ``We don't have a basis for deciding what is an extraordinarysituation,'' he said.   Leonid Abalkin, a deputy premier in charge of economic reform,said the initiative to change the draft resolution came during anovernight meeting of deputies and not from Gorbachev.   ``Everyone wants to be sympathethic, wants the public to likethem, and nobody wants to take the responsibility,'' he said.   Marju Lauristin, a deputy and leader of the Estonian PopularFront, said she favored a limit on strikes called for politicalreasons, which she said could be used as an excuse for militaryintervention.   Gorbachev, in calling for a ban on strikes, called the measurenecessary ``to protect democratization from anarchy andirresponsible management.''   By inserting the threat to take over operations and security onthe country's railroads, the legislators were acting to bring anend to a blockade by Azerbaijanis of rail lines leading from theirrepublic into Armenia.   Soviet law does not ban strikes outright. But labor unrest wasruthlessly repressed before Gorbachev came to power in 1985 andbegan his effort to turn the Soviet Union into a country ruled bylaw instead of dictate.   Gorbachev said Monday that his proposal to ban strikes was ``notan effort to stop the processes that are underway in the frameworkof perestroika.''   A key element of Gorbachev's reforms is perestroika, orrestructuring the Soviet's Union's stumbling and shortage-riddeneconomy, and the Soviet leader said that economic transformation is``under threat'' because of strikes.   First Deputy Premier Lev Voronin told lawmakers Monday that theeconomy lost $6.15 billion in July and August because of strikesand supplies of fuel are so low the country might be unable toprovide enough heat for citizens through the winter.   A letter dated Sept. 29 and read out to the Supreme Soviet fromthe Trade Union of Electrical Workers suggested that extreme actionwas needed to restore the ``rhythym of labor'' in the country.   The most damaging strike this year was a walkout in July bythousands of coal miners in the far north, Siberia, and the DonBasin of the eastern Ukraine. That strike cost the country millionsof rubles and the government agreed to a package of economic andsocial improvements that officials said will cost about $3 billion.   Strikes also have become a way of expressing ethnic discontent.   They have afflicted Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed predominantlyArmenian enclave in the southern republic of Azerbaijan. AndRussian workers in Moldavia and Estonia have struck to protestlocal laws they say favor the majority Estonians and Moldavians.   The package of laws under discussion includes the proposedcreation of a ``special form of administration'' for railroads inthe Caucasus republics, where Azerbaijanis reportedly blockedshipments of goods to Armenia.   Another proposal put forth at today's session was a price freezeon all food and manufactured goods.   The measure was proposed by the Committee of People's Control, apart of the Supreme Soviet Committee on Labor, Prices and Socialpolicy.</TEXT></DOC>
