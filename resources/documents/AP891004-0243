ATandamp;T introduced its own package of hardware and software basedon the so-called Karmarkar algorithm last year and it appears thatIBM's entry Tuesday puts the two technology giants in directcompetition.   An IBM press release made no mention of ATandamp;T and simply saidthat part of its software's power ``stems from a new programmingmethod which drew worldwide attention when it was introduced a fewyears ago.''   IBM spokesman Denis Arvay, who mentioned the ATandamp;T connection,said IBM was entitled to use the ATandamp;T patent through across-licensing agreement between the companies.   ATandamp;T spokesman Bob Ford said he could not find anyone at ATandamp;Twho knew of the IBM product and thus the company had no comment onit.   The Karmarkar algorithm, invented in 1984 by ATandamp;T's NarendraKarmarkar, is a programming method for solving resource-allocationproblems that involve huge numbers of variables, such as schedulingdaily crew assignments for a major airline.   IBM said its software was able to obtain the best solution to anairline scheduling problem in less time than a Cray 2 supercomputerfrom Cray Research Inc. reportedly took to solve a problemone-tenth the size.   IBM's software, known as the Optimization Subroutine Library,runs on big 3090 mainframe computers that have add-on equipment tomake them work as supercomputers. But IBM said versions of it canrun on smaller IBM computers, even its personal computers.   The chief creators of IBM's software were John Tomlin of IBM'sAlmaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif., and John Forrest ofthe Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.   ATandamp;T's hardware-software product, Korbx, was introduced inAugust 1988 at a price of $8.9 million. So far there are twocustomers willing to have their names publicized, the MilitaryAirlift Command and Delta Air Lines Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
