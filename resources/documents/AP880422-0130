However, Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. said that despite the successfulprosecutions, the mob is ``down but not out'' in Philadelphia.   Testifying before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee onInvestigations, Dennis said of his city's organized crime family,``I don't think it will pass from the scene very easily or veryquickly.''   Dennis described how the Philadelphia Cosa Nostra turnedincreasingly violent after the murder of its former chieftain,Angelo Bruno, who was shot to death outside his home on March 21,1980. Bruno's assassination led to a series of mob murders andsubsequent prosecutions and convictions.   The reputed current boss of the Philadelphia family, NicodemoScarfo, was convicted on extortion and conspiracy charges andsentenced in August 1987 to 14 years in prison.   He is on trial in Philadelphia, along with seven Cosa Nostramembers, on charges of killing a former ``capo'' in the Scarfoorganized crime family.   ``We certainly have the Mafia on the run in Philadelphia andelsewhere,'' Dennis said.   At present, most active members of the Philadelphia-South JerseyCosa Nostra ``are either under indictment, in custody, or both. Ifsuccessful, this series of prosecutions could effectively removethe LCN (La Cosa Nostra) from criminal activity (in Philadelphia)for at least the immediate future,'' he said.   Government crime fighters from New York and New Jersey told thesubcommittee earlier that organized crime is no longer dominated bygangsters of Italian origin, but by a ``more deadly mixture ofother ethnic immigrants.''   James R. Zazzali, a member of the New Jersey State Commission ofInvestigation, told senators Thursday that of 29 organized crimeorganizations operating in his state, ``only seven of these areMafia gangs.''   Zazzali said that ``the problem of newly emerging groups in5-to-10 years may be the major problem in organized crime.''   ``What we are experiencing now in New Jersey, in the Northeast,indeed in every metropolitan area of this nation _ is an evolutionof organized crime from domination largely by gangsters of Sicilianor other Italian origin since the 1930s to an even more deadlymixture of other ethnic immigrants,'' he said.   The groups include American blacks, Asians, Colombians, Cubans,Jamaicans and Russians, said Zazzali and Ronald Goldstock, directorof the New York Organized Crime Task Force. Motorcycle gangs havealso become a force in organized crime, they said.   Goldstock said that even now, the ``Colombian drug cartels are amuch greater problem than the traditional La Cosa Nostra.'' He saidorganized crime in the United States has changed for these reasons:   _Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act,a radically new approach that allows prosecutors to focus on theillegal enterprise as a crime rather than the individuals who runit.   Before its enactment in 1970, there was an endless war ofattrition in which one mob leader was simply replaced with another.Now, entire upper echelons of families have been indicted andconvicted.   _The breakdown of the code of silence by mobsters faced withprosecution, forfeiture of assets and incarceration. Several``elder statesmen'' became media stars, not only through testimonybut by writing books such as ``Man of Honor'' by Joe Bonnano and``The Last Mafioso'' by Jimmy ``The Weasel'' Fratianno.   _Disputes between organized crime groups have grown in numberand seriousness as the leadership has become more inexperienced andunstable.   Goldstock referred to new organized crime leaders as ``mobyuppies,'' to whom financial considerations are more important thanthe traditional codes of discipline that existed in the old-lineorganized crime families.   ``By the late 1970s, for many family members, traditional valueshad been replaced by simple cost-benefit analysis,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
