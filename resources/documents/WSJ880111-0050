Even as stock and futures industry officials, regulators and politicians quarrel over which -- if any -- of the commission's recommendations may become law, one thing is clear: Never again will futures traders enjoy the hands-off regulation they have cherished for more than a century. &quot;Free markets for free men,&quot; the slogan emblazoned on scores of futures traders' jackets here, already has a nostalgic ring to it.    &quot;There's no question Brady takes a shot directly at the futures markets,&quot; says Paul T. Jones, president of Tudor Investment Corp., a New York-based futures trading firm that trades actively in the stock-index futures markets.    The Brady report, commissioned by President Reagan to study the stock market crash, says that the inter-related trading of stock-index futures contracts and stocks played a key role in triggering the record collapse of Oct. 19. The crash starkly illustrated that the U.S. stock, stock futures and stock options markets are essentially &quot;one market,&quot; the report says, and should be regulated accordingly.    To facilitate one-market regulation, a federal agency, such as the Federal Reserve Board, should coordinate the regulation of all these markets and margins should be made &quot;consistent&quot; across markets, the report says. To quell panic market moves, it adds that &quot;circuit-breaker&quot; mechanisms -- such as daily price limits and trading halts -- should be coordinated among the markets.    The Brady report stopped short of recommending the futures industry's worst fear -- combining the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has regulated futures with a relatively light touch since it was formed in the mid-1970s, with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC, formed in response to the 1929 stock market crash, is widely viewed as a tougher, more independent regulator.    But the two agencies are undoubtedly going to be forced to work more closely together in the future, whether under the auspices of the Fed or not. The result is most likely going to be an SEC-style tightening of the regulatory reins on stock-index futures, traders say.    The Brady commission's comments on margins, though general in nature, are interpreted by many stock and futures industry officials as meaning that margins on stock-index futures should be increased from current levels of about 10%. Investors buying stock on margin are required to put up 50% of a stock's price. Some congressmen have already proposed that stock-index futures margins be raised to the same 50% level.    Futures industry officials defend the lower margins, noting that they are more akin to insurance premiums than down payments, since futures traders rarely take delivery of contracts, and in the case of cash-settled stock futures, delivery isn't even possible.    &quot;You'll make the markets non-viable even for hedgers (usually institutions holding stocks) if margins are so high that speculators (independent futures traders) can't afford to take the other side of trades,&quot; says Howard Schneider, an attorney with Rosenman andamp; Colin in New York, and the first general counsel of the CFTC.    &quot;Failure to recognize these differences (between stock and futures margins) will result in increased costs to U.S. markets, which will drive our business offshore to foreign nations eager to take such business from us just as they took the steel and auto industries,&quot; warns Thomas Donovan, Chicago Board of Trade president.    As for price limits, futures industry officials saw the regulatory writing on the wall soon after the October crash, and instituted their own price limits on daily moves up or down in stock-index futures contracts. </TEXT></DOC>
