The original May 16 close of the commentperiod was extended until July 5, 1988 (53 FR 17964-17965). More than 20entities, including conservation groups, Federal, state and local governmentagencies, private industry and other interested parties commented on theproposed rule. These comments are summarized along with responses in thediscussions below.<ITAG tagnum="84">General Requirements and Processes</ITAG>FWS and NMFS share responsibilities under the MMPA (16 U.S.C., 1361 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and ESA (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>). NMFS is responsible for species of the order Cetacea(whales and dolphins) and the suborder Pinnipedia (seals and sea lions)except walrus. FWS is responsible for the dugong, manatees, polar bear,sea and marine otters and walrus. Depending on the animals involved, theterm ``Service'' used in this document may refer to FWS and/or NMFS.Section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA allows for the taking of marine mammals incidentalto non-commercial fishing activities under certain circumstances; Section7(b)(4) of the ESA allows, under certain circumstances; for the takingof endangered and threatened species incidental to activities that haveFederal involvement or control. If a marine mammal species is listed asendangered or threatened under the ESA, the requirements of both the MMPAand ESA must be met before the incidental take can be allowed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Amendments</ITAG>Prior to amendment, section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA applied only to non-depletedspecies. Under section 3(1)(C) of the MMPA, all endangered and threatenedmarine mammals are by definition depleted. Since the more restrictive provisionsof the MMPA prevail, the ESA provisions alone could not be used to authorizethe incidental taking of endangered or threatened marine mammals.Public Law 99-659, title IV, section 411 (approved November 14, 1986) amendedsection 101(a)(5) of the MMPA and made conforming changes to sections 7(b)(4)and 7(o) of the ESA. The primary change was to allow the taking of depletedas well as non-depleted species of marine mammals incidental to specifiedactivities (other than commercial fishing operations) under certain conditions.The amendments also changed some of the conditions under which incidentaltaking can be allowed.<T3>General Comment:</T3> One commenter believed that there should notbe any taking, hunting or killing of endangered, threatened or depletedspecies.Under the 1986 Amendments, Congress provides an exception for the incidental,but not intentional, taking of small numbers of depleted marine mammalsunder limited circumstances. Although we anticipate most taking to be byharassment only, the amendment is not limited to non-lethal takings.<ITAG tagnum="84">MMPA_Section 101(a)(5) Process</ITAG>Under section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA, the Service can allow the taking ofsmall numbers of marine mammals incidental to a specified activity (otherthan commercial fishing) within a specified geographical area. For theService to consider allowing an incidental taking, a written request forspecific regulations must be submitted to the Service containing detailedinformation on the activity as a whole and impacts of the total potentialtake. The Service will evaluate the impacts resulting from all personsconducting the specified activity, not just the impacts from one entity'sactivities. If the Service makes certain findings, specific regulationswill be issued that, among other things, establish permissible methodsof taking and other means of effecting the least practicable adverse impacton the species. After regulations are issued, individual Letters of Authorizationmust be obtained from the Service by those conducting the activity.Procedural regulations implementing this provision of the MMPA are foundat 50 CFR 18.27 for FWS and at 50 CFR part 228 for NMFS.<T3>Processing time:</T3> In the preamble to the proposed rule, the Serviceadvised requestors that the regulatory process for specific regulationscan take a year or more. Many commenters believed this to be excessiveresulting in unnecessary time and financial costs to applicants and delayedthe identification and development of hydrocarbon resources. Further, twocommenters believed that the lengthy review process does not account forthe urgency of some situations, such as platform removals for safety orreuse purposes, or operational constraints due to weather and ice conditionsin Alaska. They argued that Congress intended that the Service act expeditiouslyon requests.The Service will complete the process as quickly as possible and will providethe applicant with a proposed schedule, if requested. Although regulationshave been issued in as little as six months, the process generally takeslonger because of the time necessary to complete the environmental andregulatory reviews and provide an opportunity for public comment on theproposed rule. Therefore, the Service believes one year is a realisticestimate. Knowing the potential time requirements, applicants can plantheir activities accordingly. Since the MMPA process can be conducted simultaneouslywith other requirements, early initiation of the MMPA process will avoiddelaying approval and implementation of specific activities. Once regulationsare established governing a specific activity, Letters of Authorizationcan be issued quickly and can accommodate specific urgencies.<T3>Comment Periods:</T3> Under 50 CFR 228.4(b), NMFS publishes a noticeof receipt of request for regulations and solicits information. Publiccomments are also accepted on the proposed findings and regulations. TheFWS, on the other hand, does not require publication of a notice of receiptof request and generally solicits comments only on its proposed findingsand regulations (50 CFR 18.27(d)(2)). This is the only difference betweenNMFS and FWS processes, which is relatively minor reflecting standard agencyprocedures. Some commenters opposed the initial comment period establishedby NMFS since it is not mandated under the MMPA or Administrative ProcedureAct and could delay issuance of final regulations.The NMFS approach is consistent with its general approach to regulations_providingthe public with an advance notice of a rulemaking where possible. The NMFSbelieves that the first comment period facilitates gathering all availableinformation prior to developing the required regulatory and environmentalanalyses and publishing a proposed rule. No minimum time for the initialcomment period is established in the NMFS regulations. Therefore, in unusualor critical situations, this comment period could be less than the usual30 days. In addition, drafting the required environmental and regulatorydocuments could begin during the comment period, resulting in no significantdelay to the process.<T3>Application assistance:</T3> Commenters suggested that applicants beencouraged to consult with the Service in preparing a request to identifysources of information and to ensure an adequate request.The Service agrees, but does not believe that this needs to be stated inthe regulations. The Service will assist potential applicants by explainingrequirements and identifying sources of information. Potential applicantsare encouraged to contact the Service and the Service's Regional Officesfor assistance.<T3>Completeness of request:</T3> One commenter believed that the Serviceshould be required to determine the completeness of a request within 15days. If found incomplete, the Service would notify the applicant withan explanation of what is required to make the request complete.The Service will review requests and notify applicants as soon as practicableof any additional information required. However, information needs (suchas the feasibility of implementing certain mitigating measures) may becomeapparent anytime during the regulatory process. Therefore, the Servicereserves the option to request additional information when required, ratherthan just within the first 15 days.<T3>Denial of requests: </T3>Some commenters believed that the regulationsshould require that denials of requests for specific regulations alongwith the findings in support of that decision be published and made availableto the applicant.The Service agrees and has added new andSection;andSection;18.27(d)(4) and228.4(d) requiring publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of any decision to deny a request along withthe basis for denying the request.<T3>Required information: </T3>One commenter believed that the informationrequired in andSection; 18.27(d) (vi), (vii) and (viii) and andSection; 228.4(a)(9), (10) and (11) dealing with suggested means of mitigating and monitoringimpacts should be optional, since these discussions would be more productiveafter the applicant has an opportunity to consult with the Service andsubsistence users.The Service believes the applicant should be required to identify mitigatingmeasures and ways to monitor impacts to assist the Service in developingthe most workable regulations. The applicant's detailed knowledge of theproposed activity provides a good basis for such initial proposals. Includingthese suggestions for comment and further discussion as the process continueswill serve to enhance and facilitate the process of developing regulations.Therefore, the Service has retained these questions.<T3>Total impacts:</T3> One commenter believed that the current referenceto ``cumulative'' impacts in the information required under andSection;andSection;18.27(d) and 228.4 should be deleted.As used in these sections, cumulative impacts was intended to mean thetotal impacts resulting from the activity as a whole, not just the impactsresulting from one individual's or company's participation. It was notintended to mean the impacts resulting from the activity in conjunctionwith unrelated ongoing or projected activities (as the term is used underNEPA). Therefore, the word cumulative has been deleted and the sentenceclarified to request information on the ``activity as a whole, which includes,but is not limited to, an assessment of total impacts by all persons conductingthe activity.'' (See also ``Cumulative Impacts'' discussion below.)<T3>Burden of proof: </T3>In the preamble to the proposed rule, the Servicestated that the applicant has the burden to demonstrate, through the bestscientific information available, that only a negligible impact is reasonablylikely to occur. Commenters suggested that only the best presently available,readily obtainable information should be required in requests, and thatapplicants should not be required to conduct research if information gapsexist. Commenters also objected to the applicant having the burden to demonstratenegligible impact, and believed it is the responsibility of the Service.In response to the commenters' concerns, the Service notes that its ``bestavailable scientific evidence'' standard used to determine the completenessof a request in the MMPA regulations is similar to the ``best availablescientific and commercial data'' standard that is used in the Section 7(ESA) consultation regulations. Therefore, the Service intends to use theprinciples described in the following excerpt from the preamble to theconsultation regulations when additional data is needed to complete a requestfor specific regulations under this final rule:<ITAG tagnum="21">A Service request for additonal data will not be used as a vehiclefor burdening applicants with unnecessary studies and inordinate delays* * *. As in the <T3>Pittston </T3>case [<T3>Roosevelt Campobello International Park Commission </T3>v.<T3> EPA, </T3>684 F.2d 1041 (1st Cir. 1982)], these requirements willbe limited to readily obtainable data that would assist the Service informulating its biological opinion [under Section 7(b) of the ESA] * **. [A]s in <T3>Pittston, </T3>a distinction must be made between requests for specialresearch projects and requests for routine, customary data collection activities.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">51 FR 19926, 19952 (June 3, 1986).Only the best available information needs to be submitted with a request,and conducting research is not a requirement. The Service believes it isthe responsibility of the applicant to provide the required informationand to demonstrate negligible impact since the applicant is requestingauthority to take the marine mammals and is the beneficiary of such authority.The Service will also consider information submitted by other interestedparties or otherwise available. If the information submitted by the applicanttogether with any other information available to the Service is not sufficientto support a negligible impact finding, regulations cannot be issued. Inthis case, additional studies may be needed to support a negligible impactfinding.It should also be noted that Congress placed a continuing burden on thoseoperating under the authority of Section 101(a)(5) to ``engage in appropriateresearch designed to reduce the incidental taking of marine mammals pursuantto the specified activity concerned.'' H.R. Rep. No. 228, 97th Cong., 1stSess. 20 (1981).Placing the burden on the applicant to demonstrate negligible impact isconsistent with other take authorizations under the MMPA. Under Section104(d)(3), permit applicants ``must demonstrate to the Secretary that thetaking * * * will be consistent with the purposes of this Act and the applicableregulations established under section 103 of this title.'' In the 1971House Report, Congress explained this basic concept:<ITAG tagnum="21">Before any marine mammal may be taken, the appropriate Secretary mustfirst establish general limitations on the taking, and must issue a permitwhich would allow that taking. In every case, the burden is placed uponthose seeking permits to show that the taking should be allowed and willnot work to the disadvantage of the species or stock of animals involved.If that burden is not carried_and it is by no means a light burden_thepermit may not be issued. The effect of this set of requirements is toinsist that the management of the animal populations be carried out withthe interests of the animals as the prime consideration.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">H.R. Rep. No. 707, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 18 (1971).<T3>U.S. Citizen:</T3> As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule,under section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA only U.S. citizens are eligible toapply for Letters of Authorization. Commenters believed that the definitionof U.S. citizens in the regulations is unduly restrictive since it requiresthat companies or corporations be controlled by U.S. citizens. Commenterspointed out that this is inconsistent with regulatory practice under theOuter Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) which requires only that thecompany be organized under the laws of the United States to be considereda U.S. citizen. Commenters believed that Congress intended that all holdersof offshore leases be eligible for a small take authorization under theMMPA, and, therefore, the MMPA regulatory definition should be made consistentwith the OCSLA definition.The Service agrees that a change in the definition may be appropriate.However, since this change was not discussed in the proposed rule and isa potentially significant modification, the Service is addressing thisissue in a separate proposed rulemaking to avoid delay in publication ofthis final rule. That proposed rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on August 17, 1989 (54 FR 33949).<ITAG tagnum="84">Impact on Species or Stock</ITAG>Before the Service may allow a taking of marine mammals under the authorityof section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA, it must find that the total taking expectedfrom the specified activity will have a negligible impact on the speciesor stock. After a thorough review of the public comments on this issue,the Service adopts its proposed definition of ``negligible impact.''Under the Service's regulatory definition, a finding of negligible impactwould require that the impact resulting from the specified activity cannotreasonably be expected to, and is not reasonably likely to, adversely affectthe species or stock through effects on annual rates of recruitment orsurvival. The Service believes that this definition of negligible impactfollows congressional intent when enacting Public Law 99-659.<T3>Effects on annual rates of recruitment or survival:</T3> Several commenterscontended that the proposed definition of negligible impact was too lenientbecause it suggested that only effects on annual rates of recruitment orsurvival will be considered. The commenters urged the Service to add backto the definition the standards used to determine negligible impact underthe 1981 MMPA Amendments_that the impact from the taking had to be ``sosmall, unimportant, or of so little consequence as to warrant little orno attention.'' 50 CFR 228.3 (1987) (NMFS regulations); <T3>accord</T3>, <T3>id.</T3> andSection; 18.27(c) (FWS regulations).The Service, while sympathetic with the concerns expressed by the commenters,believes that the clear congressional intent behind the 1986 Amendmentswas to alter the standard for determining negligible impact. In addition,the basic amendment to section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA expanded the coverageof this incidental take provision to depleted as well as non-depleted species,requiring a corresponding change in the approach to assessing negligibleimpact. To capture the intent of the amendment, the Service has adopted,substantially without change, the definition of negligible impact set outin the Senate's ``Section-by-Section Analysis,'' 132 Cong. Rec. S16305(Oct. 15, 1986).<T3>Species specific factors/indirect effects:</T3> Several commentersnoted that the factors analyzed to understand the expected impacts willvary widely from species to species. They also stated that a complete assessmentof effects must cover the full range of factors that support recruitmentand survival, including an assessment of indirect effects on habitat, behavioralpatterns, breeding and feeding, and special management considerations (<T3>e.g.</T3>, impacts on recovery plan objectives or other managementinitiatives).The Service agrees with these comments. Although the 1986 Amendments deletedthe reference to ``habitat'' from the determination of negligible impact,the stated reason for this change confirms that the factors indicated bythe commenters, such as effects on habitat, remain important in the assessmentof negligible impact:<ITAG tagnum="21">A minor impact upon a small segment of habitat might be found to bemore than negligible under the prior standard, even if it has no impactupon the overall population utilizing the habitat. But it is also the casethat populations could be affected a[d]versely by actions that damage rookeries,mating grounds, feeding areas and areas of similar significance. The Secretaryshall take those impacts into accounts [<T3>sic</T3>] when making a ``negligible impact'' determination under section105(A)(5)(i) [<T3>sic</T3>]. Because these factors are to be taken into account, in makingsuch a determination, subparagraph (a)(2)(A) of this section deletes thephrase ``and its habitat'' from subparagraph 5(A)(i) [<T3>sic</T3>] of the MMPA.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">132 Cong. Rec. S16305 (Oct. 15, 1986). The Service does not believethat it is necessary to amend the regulatory language to reflect the abovefactors; it is sufficient to note that the Service will consider thesefactors when determining negligible impact.<T3>Impact on optimum sustainable population (OSP):</T3> An OSP determinationis not required to make a negligible impact finding. In the preamble ofthe proposed rule, the Service provided some illustrative examples of howthe negligible impact test would be applied depending on whether the particularmarine mammal stock was within or below its OSP range. 53 FR 8473, 8474(Mar. 15, 1988). Citing the management goal of the MMPA_the maintenanceor attainment of an OSP level for each population stock of marine mammals(see sections 2(2) and 2(6) of the MMPA)_the Service set out the followinggeneral analytical framework for applying the definition of negligibleimpact:<ITAG tagnum="21">If a request for specific regulations under section 101(a)(5) involvespotential impacts to a ``depleted'' population, then a determination ofnegligible impact can be made only if the permitted activities are notlikely to significantly reduce the increase of that population or preventit from ultimately achieving its OSP; on the other hand, if a ``nondepleted''population is involved, then a determination of negligible impact can bemade only if the permitted activities are not likely to reduce that populationbelow its OSP.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">53 FR at 8474. The Service provided this proposed analytical frameworkto elicit public comment so that the final rule could more fully explorethe application of the negligible impact test. Since these examples attracteda wide spectrum of views on the basic meaning of the 1986 Amendments andnegligible impact, the Service will now clarify the analytical approachit will follow in making this essential finding.Several commenters, citing the complex and controversial nature of theOSP concept, asserted that OSP should not be used as the framework fordetermining negligible impact, especially since no mention is made in section101(a)(5) of OSP. Many of the commenters emphasized that Congress intendeda simplified process that focused on impacts on annual rates of recruitmentor survival rather than on impacts to OSP. One commenter argued that Congressrejected an analytical approach based on OSP by failing to pass H.R. 1027,99th Cong., 1st Sess. (1985), which would have authorized incidental takesunder the MMPA ``if the proposed incidental take would not impede the species'ability to eventually attain its optimum sustainable population.'' H.R.Rept. No. 124, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1985).The Service notes that H.R. 1027 would have provided an exception to thetaking prohibitions of both the ESA and the MMPA through the section 7consultation process. The rulemaking process of section 101(a)(5) of theMMPA would not have been required. The Service believes that the congressionalchoice of imposing an additional regulatory process before authorizingthe incidental taking of listed marine mammals reflected a concern forthe need for more safeguards rather than a concern for simplification.The Service did not intend, however, to imply that a formal determinationof OSP was necessary in order to make the negligible impact finding. Section101(a)(5)(C)(ii) of the MMPA clearly exempts the issuance of specific regulationsfrom compliance with the formal rulemaking requirements of section 103of the MMPA. The Service's factual examples illustrating a proposed analyticalframework for the determination of negligible impact did not involve theformal determination of OSP. The first example involved depleted populationsand how impacts to recruitment rates and survival would be treated; anOSP determination was not needed because one need only establish that thetotal take would not ``significantly reduce the increase of that population''and would not prevent ultimate achievement of OSP. This conceptual frameworkfor depleted species focuses on the absence of ``significant'' reductionsto the rate of long-term population increases and the absence of barriersto the attainment of OSP.In response to several comments, the Service notes that the same analyticalframework for depleted species applies to stocks of unknown status, sinceit is not OSP that is at issue, but rather that the incidental taking wouldnot prevent the population from attaining or maintaining its OSP.Therefore, an OSP determination is not necessary in making a negligibleimpact finding. Qualitative judgments will be made on a case-by-case basison how the anticipated incidental taking will affect the status and populationtrends of the species or stocks concerned. Many factors are used in thisdetermination, including, but not limited to, the status of the speciesor stock relative to OSP (if known), whether the recruitment rate for thespecies or stock is increasing, decreasing, stable or unknown, the sizeand distribution of the population, and existing impacts and environmentalconditions.Several commenters concurred with the Service's analytical framework fordepleted species, with one commenter stressing the need to ensure thata depleted population will increase toward its OSP at an acceptable rate.However, one commenter stated that the Service's approach was not consistentwith section 2(2) of the MMPA, which mandates that ``[f]urther measuresshould be immediately taken to replenish any species or population stockwhich has already diminished below [its OSP].'' Two commenters argued thatthe only way to satisfy these conservation goals of the MMPA is to establishthat the level of incidental take has only a negligible impact on the rateof recovery for the species or stock. Contending that a distinction mustbe made among stocks that are increasing, decreasing, or stable in thelevel of recruitment, they stated that a negligible impact should involveeffects that do not impede a stock from achieving OSP at the same rateand in the same manner that would occur in the absence of the proposedincidental take.The Service agrees that distinctions need to be made among stocks thatare increasing, decreasing, or stable when determining negligible impact.In order to make a negligible impact finding, the proposed incidental takemust not prevent a depleted population from increasing toward its OSP ata biologically acceptable rate. Consistent with this view, the Servicebelieves that insignificant reductions in the rate of the population increase(<T3>i.e.</T3>, net recruitment) do not become significant impacts on adepleted stock because the stock would not increase toward its OSP as rapidlyas it would in the absence of the incidental take. To adopt the commenters'formulation, one would have to find that the impacts of incidental takehave ``no effect'' on the rate of population growth for a depleted stock;<T3>i.e.</T3>, there would be ``no effect'' on the stock's ``rate of recovery.''The statutory standard does not require that the same recovery rate bemaintained, rather that no significant effect on annual rates of recruitmentor survival occurs. For stable or declining populations, a finding of negligibleimpact may be more difficult than for increasing populations. Section 101(a)(5)clearly indicates that some level of adverse effects involving the takeof depleted marine mammals can be authorized as long as the impact is ``negligible.''The plain language of section 2(2) does not suggest a more stringent standard.That section indicates a concern for the immediate initiation of stepsto replenish a depleted species or stock_a concern which is addressed inthe Service's analytical framework since significant reductions in recruitmentrates are not considered negligible. Further, section 2(2) does not mandatethe immediate taking of all steps to attain an OSP level for all depletedstocks; such a reading of the purposes and policies of the MMPA would displacethe clear congressional intent behind section 101(a)(5), which was designedto alleviate conflicts, where the impacts are negligible, between activities(other than commercial fishing) that involve the incidental taking of marinemammals and the strict moratorium against taking.One commenter suggested that a more appropriate standard for determiningnegligible impact for a depleted stock would be whether the level of incidentaltaking is likely to substantially reduce the rate of population growth.By substituting ``substantial'' for the Service's term ``significant,''the commenter argues that statistically measurable effects would not necessarilycause an applicant to be ineligible for a take under section 101(a)(5).The commenter further recommended that a level of acceptable take_withinthe range of 10 to 50 percent of annual recruitment_be prescribed in theregulations.The Service does not share the commenter's concerns. The absence of substantialreductions in population growth does not automatically correspond witha negligible impact; significant adverse effects, although not substantialin nature, can prevent the Service from finding negligible impact. Further,the Service declines to prescribe acceptable taking levels. Such numericallimits would ignore the significant differences in the status and populationdynamics among the various marine mammal stocks and the type of taking(<T3>i.e.</T3>, harassment versus mortality) or other impacts. The determinationof negligible impact must take into account the status and the particularbiological requirements of the species or stock, as well as the effectsof the incidental taking on the rate of recruitment.The second example presented in the preamble of the proposed rule involvedthe determination of negligible impact with respect to a non-depleted stockof marine mammals. If a particular stock were known to be within its OSPrange, then the Service believes a finding of negligible impact can onlybe made if the permitted activities are not likely to reduce that stockbelow its OSP. However, not all takings that do not reduce the populationbelow its OSP would be considered negligible.The Service's analytical framework for non-depleted stocks recognizes thathealthy marine mammal populations that have reached an equilibrium levelusually experience fluctuations in population numbers within some normalrange due to a variety of environmental and biological factors. Such fluctuationsmay involve short-term population declines that do not pose a risk to thestocks remaining within the limits of OSP. The Service believes that minimalimpacts on a healthy stock caused by incidental taking can still be considerednegligible if such taking does not cause the population to fluctuate beyondnormal limits. In other words, for a population stock that is at its OSPlevel, slight impacts on the stock resulting from incidental take do notrise to the level of ``adverse effects'' on annual rates of recruitmentor survival if the population stock is maintained at essentially the samelevel.One commenter opposed the Service's approach to non-depleted stocks byarguing that it is too permissive. Contending that the Service's analyticalframework could allow a stock to be reduced from 95 to 60 percent of carryingcapacity in determining negligible impact, the commenter noted that sucha significant population decrease would have to be evaluated through thewaiver process in section 101(a)(3) of the MMPA.The Service agrees that the commenter's extreme example would not be eligiblefor treatment under the ``small take'' provisions of section 101(a)(5)of the MMPA; such large takes should be instead considered under the waiverprocedures in sections 101(a)(3) and 103 of the MMPA. As explained above,the key factor is the significance of the level of impact on rates of recruitmentand survival. Only insignificant impacts on long-term population levelsand trends can be treated as negligible.Several commenters stated that the Service's ``dual standard'' for assessingnegligible impact was inappropriate because Congress intended a uniformsystem.The Service's examples in the proposed rule were intended to show how anegligible impact finding might be approached in different situations.This is not a dual standard, but, instead, the illustration of how to applythe rule in contrasting fact situations. Again, the formal determinationof OSP is not a prerequisite to issuing specific regulations.<T3>Cumulative impacts: </T3>In determining impact, the Service must evaluatethe ``total taking'' expected from the specified activity in a specificgeographic area. The estimate of total taking involves the accumulationof impacts from all anticipated activities that are expected to be coveredby the specific regulations. In other words, the applicant's anticipatedtaking from its own activities is only one part of the story; the totaltakings expected from all persons conducting the activities to be coveredby the regulations must be determined.Several commenters asked that the Service clarify the concept of ``totaltaking'' by amending the definition of negligible impact.The Service declines to do so because it believes that the definition ofnegligible impact is effective as written since it clearly states the impacts``resulting from the specified activity'' as discussed above.Two commenters asked how to assess the degree of impacts in the situationwhere, although separate activities by themselves pose negligible impacts,a combination of impacts poses a significant impact on the species or stock.The Service agrees with the commenters that the impacts of incidental takefrom successive or contemporaneous activities must be added to the baselineof existing impacts to determine negligible impact. While the impacts ofa particular activity may be fairly minor, they may in fact be more thannegligible when measured against a baseline that includes a significantexisting take of marine mammals from the other activities.The commenter believed that the regulations should identify an order ofpriority for various types of taking (<T3>e.g.</T3>, subsistence taking and incidental taking) and describe howallowable takes will be allocated to each type of activity. Another commenterargued that the 1986 Amendments do not estabish a priority system for takings,incidental or intentional.The Service notes that ongoing authorized activities are factored intothe baseline of existing impacts to determine negligible impact of a requestedactivity. To the extent that subsistence is part of the baseline, subsistencetakes are accommodated and allocation between subsistence and incidentaltaking is not necessary.Some commenters asked the Service to limit the determination of negligibleimpact to direct impacts of the specified activity and to exclude cumulativeeffects resulting from future, unrelated activities.As discussed previously, the Service must look at both direct and indirecteffects, but not the cumulative effects, in making findings under section101(a)(5) of the MMPA concerning negligible impact. The Service will considercumulative effects that are reasonably foreseeable when preparing its analysisunder the National Environmental Policy Act. Additionally, cumulative effectsthat are reasonably certain to occur and ``effects of the action'' willbe considered in any necessary consultation under section 7(a)(2) of theESA. 50 CFR 402.02, 402.14(g) (3), (4) (1987); 51 FR 19926, 19932-33 (June3, 1986) (preamble discussion in the section 7 regulations). In view ofthe above, the Service does not believe it is necessary to add a discussionon cumulative effects to the definition of negligible impact.<T3>Impact on individuals: </T3>As stated in the preamble of the proposedrule, the negligible impact finding is made with respect to impacts tothe marine mammal species or stock and not with respect to impacts to individualanimals. Some commenters believed that this should be clearly stated inthe regulations, rather than just in the preamble.The Service declines to add a statement to the regulatory definition ofnegligible impact because the preamble discussion and the definition clearlystate that only impacts that ``adversely affect the species or stock''are considered.One commenter noted that, in many cases, available scientific informationon the size and population dynamics of a particular stock may be inadequateto assess the degree of impacts posed by incidental take. In those cases,the commenter suggested that the Service should assess impacts based upona consideration of impacts to individual animals.The Service disagrees. If information is lacking to define a particularpopulation or stock of marine mammal, then impacts resulting from incidentaltake should be assessed with respect to the species as a whole. <T3>See </T3>132 Cong. Rec. S16304-05 (Oct. 15, 1986).Addressing the degree of information needed to assess the impacts of incidentaltake, one commenter noted that the Service may deny a request for specificregulations only if the record reflects a valid scientific basis for theconclusion that a more than negligible impact would be posed to the overallpopulation.Although the commenter is correct that the focus should be on impacts tothe overall population, the burden will be on both the applicant and theService to show that information exists in the administrative record tosupport a negligible impact finding. <T3>See</T3> earlier discussion on ``Burden of Proof.''One commenter believed that the use of OSP as described in the preambleto the proposed rule would shift the focus away from consideration of populationimpacts.The Service disagrees. As explained earlier, an OSP determination is notrequired to make a negligible impact finding. The Service will use allavailable information concerning a population, including its status relativeto OSP (if known).<T3>Speculative impacts:</T3> A variety of comments were received on theissue of how speculative impacts should be treated in determining negligibleimpact. Several commenters argued that the regulations should clearly statethat speculative or conjectural effects will not be considered in evaluatingimpacts. One commenter added that negligible impact should be found whenthe probability of occurrence of an impact is low whereas the potentialimpact may be significant. However, other commenters, citing the lack ofdefinitive data on the population dynamics of some marine mammal populations,suggested that the Service should err on the side of caution when labelingcertain impacts as ``speculative'' or ``conjectural.'' One commenter statedthat the allowance of incidental taking of a depleted species when theimpacts of such taking cannot presently be assessed would be in violationof both the MMPA and the ESA.The Service believes that the discussion regarding speculative impactsin the preamble of the proposed rule accurately interpreted the legislativeintent behind the 1986 Amendments:<ITAG tagnum="21">If potential effects of a specified activity are conjectural or speculative,a finding of negligible impact may be appropriate. A finding of negligibleimpact may also be appropriate if the probability of occurrence is lowbut the potential effects may be significant. In this case, the probabilityof occurrence of impacts must be balanced with the potential severity ofharm to the species or stock when determining negligible impact. In applyingthis balancing test, the Service will thoroughly evaluate the risks involvedand the potential impacts on marine mammal populations. Such determinationswill be made based on the best available scientific information.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">53 FR at 8474; <T3>accord,</T3> 132 Cong. Rec. S16305 (Oct. 15, 1986). The Service recognizesthe tension that exists between development interests and wildlife resourceinterests when restrictions on development are predicated upon the existenceof adverse impacts that are speculative in nature. To resolve these difficultsituations, the legislative history of the 1986 Amendments endorsed theuse of a balancing approach to weigh the likelihood of occurrence againstthe severity of the potential impact:<ITAG tagnum="21">The degree of certainty of occurrence required in these judgmentsshould be inversely proportional to the resultant harm to the overall population.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">132 Cong. Rec. S16305 (Oct. 15, 1986). In applying this balancingtest, the Service must, of necessity, evaluate each request for specificregulations on a case-by-case basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">Impact on Habitat</ITAG>The amendments deleted the required finding that the specfied activityhave only a negligible impact upon the marine mammal habitat. Under theprevious standard, a minor impact on a small segment of habitat might befound to be more than negligible and the incidental take prohibited evenif the overall impact on the species or stock utilizing the habitat wasnegligible. Nevertheless, impacts on rookeries, mating grounds, feedingareas and areas of similar significance could have adverse effects on thespecies or stock. As discussed in the ``Impacts on Species or Stock'' sectionabove, impacts on habitat are part of the consideration in making the findingof negligible impact on the species or stock. Further, even if the impactis determined to be negligible, specific regulations must include measuresto ensure the least practicable adverse impact on the habitat.<T3>Definition:</T3> Commenters believed that the definition of negligibleimpact should specify that impacts on habitat will not be considered unlessthey have a greater than negligible impact on the marine mammal populationas a whole.The Service believes the definition of negligible impact reflects thisand no changes are necessary.<T3>Required information:</T3> Since impacts on habitat are consideredonly in the context of impacts on the species, one commenter believed thatthe Service should delete the requirement, in a request, for informationconcerning impacts on habitat (andSection;andSection;18.27(d) (iv), (v) and228.4(a) (7), (8)). Commenters also believed that the information requiredshould be restricted to impacts that can be expected to adversely affectthe overall population through effects on rates of recruitment or survivalor should be restricted to the impacts on exisiting rookeries, mating grounds,feeding areas, and areas of similar significance.The Service believes the existing information required should be retained.A description of the impacts on the habitat and the effects of any lossor modification of habitat on the marine mammal populations is needed inthe Service's evaluation of negligible impact. If the impacts on habitatare not likely to result in more than a negligible impact on the population,then they will not be a basis for denying a request. However, the Servicestill has an obligation to require measures to ensure the least practicableadverse impact on the habitat, whether or not it causes more than a negligibleimpact on the populations, paying particular attention to rookeries, matinggrounds, and areas of similar significance.<T3>Relation to critical habitat:</T3> Commenters suggested that the preambleclarify that impacts on habitat are considered in the broad biologicalsense. They stated that effects on critical habitat would be consideredin the ESA Section 7 consultation process.Impacts on the population of the loss or modification of any part of thepopulation's habitat are considered in determining negligible impact. ``Criticalhabitat'' is a regulatory determination under the ESA. Section 7 requiresthat Federal agencies ensure that their activities are not likely to jeopardizethe continued existence of endangered or threatened species or result inthe destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitats. Onlyimpacts on those areas designated as critical habitat are considered inthe determination of destruction or adverse modification. However, impactson the species of the loss or modification of any part of habitat is evaluatedin the determination of jeopardy.<ITAG tagnum="84">Impact on Subsistence Uses</ITAG>The amendments changed the standard used to evaluate the impact on subsistenceuses from ``negligible impact'' to ``not having an unmitigable adverseimpact.'' To determine that an unmitigable adverse impact on subsistenceuses exists, two elements must be present. First, the impact resultingfrom the specified activity must be likely to reduce the availability ofthe species to a level insufficient for a harvest to meet subsistence needsby (1) causing the marine mammals to abandon or avoid hunting areas, (2)directly displacing subsistence users, or (3) placing physical barriersbetween the marine mammals and subsistence hunters. Second, it must bean impact that cannot be sufficiently mitigated by other measures to increasethe availability of marine mammals to allow subsistence needs to be met.Those conducting the specified activity, the involved Federal agencies,and the affected subsistence users, are encouraged to meet and developmutually agreeable conditions which satisfy the operational, scientificor other needs of the activity and the requirements of subsistence users.<T3>Unmitigable adverse impact:</T3> One commenter suggested that, consistentwith the legislative history of the amendments, the definition of ``unmitigableadverse impact'' should be clarified to specify that an impact must resultfrom the specified activity rather than from environmental or other factors.The Service agrees that only impacts on subsistence uses resulting fromthe specific activity should be considered in determining if an unmitigableadverse impact exists. Environmental and other factors not related to thespecific activity are evaluated only in determining existing baseline conditionsand availability. Since the regulatory definition clearly states that ``unmitigableadverse impact'' means an impact ``resulting from the specified activity,''no changes are warranted.One commenter suggested that mitigation should not require the eliminationof an impact. Rather, reducing the impact such that subsistence needs canbe met would be sufficient in the commenter's opinion.The new standard of ``unmitigable adverse impact'' does not require theelimination of adverse impacts, only mitigation sufficient to meet subsistencerequirements. However, the amendments also require that the specific regulationsgoverning an activity include measures to ensure the least practicableadverse impact on the availability of marine mammals for subsistence uses,even if the activity will not otherwise have an unmitigable adverse impact.Hence, any adverse impacts would have to be mitigated to the extent practicable.Another commenter stated that to reflect congressional intent, the definitionof ``unmitigable adverse impact'' should specify that animals would haveto vacate a hunting area rather than just avoid it. In addition, the numberof marine mammals that would have to abandon or avoid a hunting area toconstitute an adverse impact should be a criterion in the regulations accordingto the commenter.The legislative history of the amendments emphasizes the availability of``sufficient numbers'' of marine mammals to meet the subsistence needsof the community. In this context, ``vacate'' was intended to connote boththe temporary and permanent absence of marine mammals from subsistencehunting areas. Hence, the terms ``abandon'' and ``avoid'' are more precisethan ``vacate''_abandonment of habitat involves forsaking an area completely,while avoidance includes temporary absence from or bypassing an area.Specifying the number, proportion, or some other quantification of animalsavoiding or abandoning an area that would constitute an adverse impactis difficult. The value assigned such a criterion would vary dependingon the specific circumstances, including actual subsistence needs, theextent of the area avoided by the marine mammals, and whether or not animalsremain available in other areas. If appropriate and feasible, such a criterionwill be established during the development of specific regulations foran activity. Since it may not be possible to establish such a criterionin all instances, it is not required in these regulations.<T3>Cultural subsistence:</T3> A commenter suggested that cultural aspectsof dependence on marine mammals should be reflected in the definition ofsubsistence needs in addition to the nutritional and other physical attributesusually associated with this term. This commenter added that since thecultural significance of subsistence harvests is to a great extent specificto individual communities, the impacts of a specified activity on subsistenceuses must be assessed locally.The finding of an unmitigable adverse impact considers the availabilityof the species for subsistence needs and is not based on cultural considerations.To the extent that opportunities to meet the subsistence needs of the communityremain available, however, many of the cultural dimensions of subsistenceuse would be accommodated. ``Availability'' provides opportunities fortraditional hunts and for the Native community to transmit its hunting-basedculture to each new generation. In keeping with the emphasis in the legislativehistory, the definition of unmitigable adverse impact has been modifiedto emphasize ``availability.'' Such emphasis will accommodate many of thecultural dimensions of subsistence uses of marine mammals. Although theamendments changed the standard for evaluating impacts on subsistence usesfrom ``negligible impact'' to ``unmitigable adverse impact,'' the availabilityof marine mammals for subsistence harvest remains a central consideration.<T3>Coordination with subsistence users:</T3> A commenter suggested thelanguage from the preamble encouraging the agency, applicant and affectedsubsistence users to agree upon terms and conditions for activities whichsatisfy their subsistence, operational, scientific and other needs be incorporatedinto the regulations.Such coordination could be effective in identifying and achieving consensusregarding subsistence mitigation measures to be incorporated in specificregulations. For instance, though not required under the regulations, affectednative interests and applicants could agree that the availability of marinemammals could be achieved by means other than the traditional distributionof the animals. The Service encourages, and as appropriate will participatein, such cooperative ventures. Language has been added to andSection;andSection;18.27(d)(1)(vi) and 228.4(9) to encourage, but not require, such coordination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Mitigating Measures</ITAG>The preamble of the proposed rule discussed mitigating measures in threecontexts. With regard to negligible impact determinations, if the impactof a specified activity would be rendered negligible by mitigating measureswhen that requirement would not otherwise be satisfied, the Service maymake a negligible impact finding subject to successful implementation ofthose mitigating measures. In evaluating impacts on subsistence uses ofmarine mammals, the Service must find that the specified activity willnot have an unmitigable adverse impact. Finally, the amendments requirethat specific regulations governing a specified activity include measuresto ensure the least practicable adverse impact on the species and its habitatand on the availability of the species for subsistence uses. Mitigatingmeasures are intended to ensure the availability of enough animals to meetsubsistence needs and to minimize impacts on the species or stock and subsistenceusers.<T3>Support mitigating measures:</T3> One commenter endorsed the requirementfor mitigating measures to reduce the impact of specific activities onmarine mammal populations, habitats and subsistence uses to negligiblelevels. The commenter suggested that if it is determined that mitigatingmeasures have been or could be effective, those measures should be requiredin specific regulations and as a condition for issuing any Letter of Authorization.The Service agrees. The regulations require the inclusion of mitigatingmeasures, as appropriate, in specific regulations and as a condition forissuing Letters of Authorization.<T3>Service's responsibility to identify mitigating measures:</T3> A commentersuggested that the Service has the responsibility to identify mitigatingmeasures. While the requester and the Service, in many instances, shareresponsibility for identifying mitigating measures, the commenter arguedthat the Service is vested with the ultimate responsibility to search forappropriate mitigating measures before denying a request for specific regulations.The Service disagrees. Since the applicant is most familiar with the natureand extent of the activity contemplated and has the detailed knowledgeof possible alternatives to that activity and the impacts on marine mammals,the applicant is in the best position to identify and assess mitigatingmeasures. In addition, as the primary beneficiary of any incidental takeauthorization, the applicant should be ultimately responsible for identifyingsuch measures. Nevertheless, the Service will consider all available informationin assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of measures to mitigate theadverse impacts of the proposed taking and in developing specific regulations.<T3>Required coordination with applicant:</T3> To facilitate coordination,a commenter proposed that requesters be advised of any mitigating measurescontained in a proposed rule at least 10 days prior to publication in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>. Under this procedure, if the requester, within10 days of such notification, finds the mitigating measures to be inappropriateor economically prohibitive, publication may be delayed to communicatethese concerns to the Service.The Service finds it unnecessary to delay the rulemaking process giventhe requirement for public comment on the proposed rule, including anymitigating measures. In addition, the applicant could always petition forfurther review.<ITAG tagnum="84">Letters of Authorization</ITAG>This rule makes technical modifications to two paragraphs in the existingregulations (50 CFR 18.27(f) and 228.6) related to Letters of Authorization.The changes are intended to make the language in those paragraphs consistentwith the new definitions of ``negligible impact'' and ``unmitigable adverseimpact'' and the use and interpretation of those terms elsewhere in theregulations. Although not discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule,there were several comments related to Letters of Authorization.<T3>Modification of Letters of Authorization:</T3> One commenter suggestedthat the regulations should provide for modification of Letters of Authorizationas an alternative to withdrawal or suspension. In particular, it was proposedthat these authorization documents should not be suspended unless the Servicefinds there are no additional or alternative mitigating measures whichwould alleviate the need for such action.Current procedures allow the modification of Letters of Authorization toreflect changed conditions through withdrawal and reissuance as long asthe incidental take levels or other requirements of the specific regulationsare not violated. If Letters of Authorization are withdrawn or suspendedon a class basis, a rulemaking to establish new specific regulations canbe initiated. In some cases this approach would be preferable since a comprehensivereevaluation would be required on whether the specified activity is stillhaving a negligible impact.<T3>Public comment on emergency withdrawal or suspension of Letters ofAuthorization:</T3> A commenter suggested that the emergency withdrawalor suspension authority in 50 CFR 18.27(f)(6) and 228.6(f) be curtailedby requiring that the Service, based on the best scientific informationavailable, find that there is an immediate and substantial risk to thewell-being of the marine mammal populations involved without such emergencyaction.Such a finding is, in effect, required under present law and regulations.Moreover, due to the potentially serious consequences of withdrawal orsuspension of Letters of Authorization, the Service would make every effortto provide notice and an opportunity where possible for public commentunder the provisions of 50 CFR 18.27(f)(5) and 228.6(e). However, if anemergency exists, the Service is required by the provisions of section101(a)(5)(C)(i) of the MMPA to take appropriate action to protect marinemammals. Hence, the Service must retain authority for emergency withdrawalor suspension to address situations where species or populations wouldbe threatened by lack of prompt action.<ITAG tagnum="84">ESA_Section 7 Process</ITAG>As stated above, the regulations governing small takes of marine mammalsnow include depleted as well as non-depleted marine mammals. Consultationunder section 7 of the ESA is also necessary if the issuance of regulationsunder section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA is a Federal action that involves theincidental taking of endangered or threatened marine mammals. In additionto satisfying the MMPA criteria, incidental take of endangered or threatenedspecies also must comply with section 7 of the ESA.Under section 7(a)(2) of the ESA, Federal agencies are required to consultwith the Service to insure that any action they authorize, fund or carryout is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of an endangeredor threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modificationof critical habitat. Although this consultation is primarily between theFederal agency and the Service, applicants for Federal licenses, permitsor funding are encouraged to participate. The Federal agency initiatesformal consultation by a written request to the Service that includes detailedinformation concerning the potential effects of the proposed action. Consultationshould be concluded within 90 days.After consultation, the Service issues its biological opinion which includesan assessment of impacts and its conclusion on whether or not the actionis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatenedspecies or result in the destruction or adverse modification of criticalhabitat. In those cases where the Service concludes that an action (orthe implementation of reasonable and prudent alternative(s)) is not likelyto result in jeopardy or adverse modification but may result in the incidentaltake of endangered or threatened species, the Service includes an incidentaltake statement in the biological opinion as required by section 7(b)(4).Compliance with the terms and conditions specified in the incidental takestatement exempts the Federal agency and any permit or license applicantinvolved from the taking prohibitions of the ESA up to the level specifiedin the incidental take statement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Coordination Between the ESA and MMPA</ITAG>One of the purposes of the amendments to the MMPA and the ESA was to clarifythe relationship between these statutes so that decision processes undereach would be coordinated and integrated to the maximum extent practicable.The ESA alone does not provide authority for the incidental take of endangeredor threatened marine mammals_the requirements of both the MMPA and ESAmust be met. The incidental take statement issued under the authority ofthe ESA will include terms and conditions with which a Federal agency orapplicant must comply. The amendment added a provision to section 7(b)(4)which directs that the provisions of section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA mustbe completed before the incidental take of endangered or threatened marinemammals is allowed. In addition to the reasonable and prudent measuresto minimize the impact of the incidental take, an incidental take statementwill include measures which are required to comply with section 101(a)(5)of the MMPA and applicable regulations. The difficulty of coordinatingthe ESA consultation and MMPA exemption processes is that section 7(b)of the ESA generally requires that consultation be completed within 90days while the MMPA regulatory process is much longer.<T3>Delay of section 7 process:</T3> One commenter stated that the preambleimplied that initiation of section 7 consultation would be delayed untilthe MMPA process was well underway. They stated that the processes shouldbe conducted simultaneously and that the ESA process should begin immediatelyupon submission of the MMPA request.Because of the timing discrepancy between the two processes reflectingprocedural differences maintained by Congress, the MMPA section 101(a)(5)process cannot be completed as expeditiously as the ESA process. However,the legislative history offers options on how to handle the timing discrepanciesbetween the two Acts, two of which were summarized in the preamble to theproposed rule. The first is to consider initiating the MMPA section 101(a)(5)process in advance of the ESA section 7 process. In this way, the MMPArequirements can be incorporated into the ESA incidental take statementwhen the biological opinion is issued and subsequent revisions would notbe necessary. Another option is to have the Federal agency and the Serviceagree to extend the consultation under section 7(b)(1)(A) to accommodatecompletion of the section 101(a)(5) regulations. The consent of any permitor license applicant is required for an extension of more than 60 days.An additional option involves early consultation under section 7(a)(3)of the ESA. Under this approach, a preliminary biological opinion couldbe issued on the prospective agency action. When the section 101(a)(5)process is completed, the biological opinion would be reviewed and theESA section 7(b)(4) incidental take statement amended or added, as appropriate.These, or similar options, will be available to the agency and the applicantas appropriate.  <T3>Issuance of incidental take statements: </T3>One commenter pointedout the different approaches taken by NMFS and FWS in how they handle theincidental take statements included in the biological opinion, and urgedthat these regulations established a consistent policy. Another commenterargued that the ESA biological opinion should be completed within the requiredtime limits and the incidental take statement added to the opinion uponcompletion of the MMPA process.  The Service agrees with these comments and, therefore, in the future, neitheragency will issue an incidental take statement in the biological opinionif consultation is completed before the section 101(a)(5) regulations areissued. The biological opinion will later be amended to include the incidentaltake statement.  One commenter said that section 7 of the ESA requires the timely issuanceof biological opinions and incidental take statements.  The Service agrees and will continue to issue biological opinions withinthe section 7 timeframe. However, the portion of the incidental take statementdealing with marine mammals will be added to the biological opinion afterthe MMPA requirements have been satisfied.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Section 7(o) of the ESA  </ITAG>Section 7(o) of the ESA, as amended, specifies that any taking in compliancewith the terms and conditions of an incidental take statement is not aprohibited taking under the ESA. No other ESA permit or authorization isrequired of the Federal agency or applicant in carrying out the actionif the incidental take statement applies and if the action complies withthe terms and conditions of that statement. The biological opinion plusthe incidental take statement operate as an exemption under section 7(o)(2)of the ESA. The new andSection;402.14(i)(5) clarifies this provision.  <T3>Private actions: </T3>In the preamble to the proposed rule, the Servicecited the following example concerning private actions. Section 10(a) ofthe ESA allows the Service to issue permits for the taking of endangeredspecies incidental to an otherwise lawful non-Federal action within theUnited States and its territorial sea, subject to certain conditions. In1982, Congress added this provision to allow incidental taking associatedwith private actions that are not subject to the section 7 consultationprocess.  If an endangered or threatened marine mammal may be taken incidentallyto a private action, regulations under section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA wouldbe required. Consultation under section 7 of the ESA would be conductedsince issuance of the MMPA regulations is a Federal action. The incidentaltake statement issued with the biological opinion would address takingconcerns under the ESA, and a section 10 permit would not be required. Two commenters disagreed with this interpretation, contending that it wouldallow wholly non-Federal activities to be relieved of section 10 requirements(except for the necessity of obtaining MMPA incidental taking authority),most notably the conservation plan obligations.  This implies that private activities are subject to stricter protectionstandards than activities with Federal involvement. This contention misconstruesthe purpose and effect of section 10 provisions relating to private actions.These provisions were added by Congress to allow persons engaged in activitieswith no discretionary Federal involvement the same access to ESA exemptionsand provisions as those engaged in activities requiring Federal approvalor scrutiny. There is no indication in the ESA or its legislative historythat Congress intended to set up substantially different or stricter protectionstandards for private activities by requiring a conservation plan. In commentingon the standards to be used in granting section 10 permits for privateactivities, the House Report states the following:  <ITAG tagnum="21">The [S]ecretary would base his determination on whether or not togrant the permit under the same standard as found in section 7(a)(2) ofthe Act, that is, whether or not the taking would jeopardize the continuedexistence of the species. To issue the permit, the Secretary would alsohave to find that the taking would be incidental to another activity andthat the applicant would minimize the taking to the maximum extent practicable. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">H.R. Rep. No. 567, 97th Cong., 2nd Sess. 31 (1982). Section 7 and section 10 are designed to achieve the same objectives throughdifferent procedural means. The conservation plan requirement is the meansfor ensuring effective and timely Federal involvement in an otherwise privateactivity. For those activities already subject to such involvement throughregulations or permits, there is no need for a separate conservation plan.Under both sections 7 and 10, the endangered and threatened species areafforded the same level of protection. To require a separate section 10 permit in addition to section 101(a)(5)regulations and a section 7 consultation would serve only to increase theadministrative burden on the applicant and the government with no correspondingbenefit to endangered or threatened marine species. <ITAG tagnum="84">Exceeding Take Limits </ITAG>One commenter suggested that the regulations should specify what will happenwhen an incidental take level is exceeded, and that this be the same forall incidental take authorizations under both the MMPA and ESA. The Service agrees that provisions for addressing excessive incidentaltake should be consistent for authorizations under MMPA regulations andESA incidental take statements. The MMPA and ESA incidental take processesare similar in that when an incidental take authorization is exceeded,the activity must be reevaluated. However, if the activity continued duringsuch a reevaluation, then any resultant taking would be subject to penaltiesunder the ESA and/or the MMPA. Under section 7 of the ESA, consultation must be reinitiated immediatelyby the Federal agency if the incidental take level is exceeded (<T3>see</T3> 50 CFR andSection;402.14(i)(4)). Exceeding the level of anticipatedtaking does not, by itself, require the stopping of an ongoing action duringreinitiation of consultation. However, any further taking resulting fromthe activity would be illegal under the ESA. If formal consultation isreinitiated, section 7(d) of the ESA again takes effect. That provisionprohibits the Federal agency or applicant from making any irreversibleor irretrievable commitment of resources which has the effect of foreclosingthe formulation or implementation of any reasonable or prudent alternativeswhich would avoid violating section 7(s)(2). The parallel language in section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA requires withdrawalor suspension of Letters of Authorization either on an individual or classbasis if, after notice and public comment, it is found that the impactof the authorized incidental take is more than negligible (<T3>see</T3> 50 CFR 18.27(f)(5) and 228.6(e)). The Southern Sea Otter TranslocationProject, an issue raised by the commenter, involves a fundamentally differentsituation in that it is an experimental effort authorized by a specialstatute and by a scientific research permit. <ITAG tagnum="84">Sea Otter Management Zone </ITAG>In 1986, Public Law 99-625 was passed by Congress to govern the translocationof southern sea otters for research and recovery purposes. The FWS hasestablished an experimental population of sea otters around San NicolasIsland, Ventura County, California. One commenter stated that these regulations should not apply to activitieswithin the management zone for the experimental population of the sea otter.There are two zones established by the translocation project. The firstarea is the translocation zone around San Nicolas Island that has a baselineat the 15-fathom isobath with the boundaries extending 10 to 15 nauticalmiles from the baseline. The second zone surrounds the translocation zoneand is an otter-free or management zone, encompassing all marine waterssubject to U.S. jurisdiction from Point Conception south. Within the translocation zone, except for defense-related actions and actionsinitiated prior to the passage of Public Law 99-625, the consultation provisionsof section 7(a)(2) of the ESA and the provisions of the MMPA apply. Withinthe management zone, unless the proposed action may affect the ``parentpopulation'' (see 50 CFR 17.84(d)(1)(iv), the provisions of section 7(a)(2)of the ESA and the restrictions on incidental taking under the MMPA donot apply. However, the section 7(a)(4) requirement to confer applies toFederal activities within the management zone and to defense-related activitiesin either zone. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Changes </ITAG>These regulations amend 50 CFR parts 18, 228 and 402 to implement the 1986Amendments to section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA and sections 7(b)(4) and 7(o)of the ESA. Basic processes for authorizing incidental take under bothESA and MMPA remain the same; the primary changes are (1) allowing theincidental take of depleted marine mammals, and (2) changing the findingsthat must be made to allow a take. <T3>Authority citation:</T3> Commenters noted that the authority citationfor 50 CFR part 228 should be 16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(5), rather than the entireMMPA, since the criteria to be considered are entirely within section 101(a)(5).The Service disagrees. Although the criteria are all contained within section101(a)(5), the enforcement and penalty provisions of the MMPA also applyto activities conducted under section 101(a)(5). <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>The Department of the Interior, as lead agency, has prepared an environmentalassessment on this rule. On the basis of this assessment, it has been determinedthat this is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the qualityof the human environment within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of theNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Therefore, an environmentalimpact statement need not be prepared. The regulations are procedural and,by themselves, do not authorize the taking of depleted marine mammals.Issuance of specific regulations under section 101(a)(5) of the MMPA allowinga taking would require compliance with NEPA, including the preparationof a separate environmental assessment or impact statement if required.<T3>NEPA compliance:</T3> One commenter believed that the issuance of specificregulations allowing an incidental take should not require the preparationof a separate environmental assessment or impact statement. It was statedthat given the thresholds of negligible impact on a species or stock andno unmitigable adverse impact on subsistence users, requests under section101(a)(5) would appear to qualify for categorical exclusion treatment underthe Council for Environmental Quality's regulations, and the Service shouldamend its NEPA regulations accordingly.Since the Service must analyze the proposal for specific regulations tomake the determination that the proposal has only a negligible impact ona species or stock and does not have an unmitigable adverse impact on subsistenceusers, the NEPA process will be used to facilitate those determinations.The issuance of specific regulations allowing incidental take would normallyonly require the preparation of an environmental assessment. Thus, theService does not believe a categorical exclusion is warranted or that itsNEPA regulations need to be amended.It has been determined that these regulations do not constitute a majorrule as defined in Executive Order 12291. The Department of the Interiorhas certified under the terms of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) that the regulations will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. The amendments of rulesgoverning the take of small numbers of marine mammals incidental to specifiedactivities will have little, if any, economic effect.
