There were noimmediate reports of damage or casualties.   The first quake was reported in the Nagano and Takada areas,about 110 miles northwest of Tokyo, and around Niigata, about 160miles northwest of the capital, the Meteorological Agency said.   Five more temblors were reported within two hours in the generalarea. The agency said the earthquakes' epicenter was at a depth ofless than three miles in western Niigata Prefecture.   Police in Nagano and Niigata reported no injuries or damages.   The Richter scale measures ground motion, with each digitrepresenting a ten-fold increase in magnitude. A reading of 4 cancause moderate damage, and a 6 can bring severe damage in populatedareas.   The quakes were apparently too small to satisfy a prediction byIben Browning, a New Mexico physicist and self-professedclimatologist, who predicted a high probability of a severeearthquake in Tokyo, Missouri or California between Dec. 2-4.   Few officials reacted to the report in Japan, one of the mostearthquake-active nations in the world.</TEXT></DOC>
