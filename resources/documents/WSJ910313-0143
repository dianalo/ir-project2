Sevenmonths after Paris brokerage firm Tuffier, Ravier, Py andamp;Associes filed for bankruptcy, many of its clients have stillnot been reimbursed for shares and cash frozen in theiraccounts at the time.   Blocking the process, stock-exchange officials say, arehundreds of millions of francs of unsettled trades andmissing stock from Tuffier's accounts, a legacy of botchedbookkeeping and unsupervised dealing.</LP><TEXT>   The root of the problem lies in the French stock market'sspeedy modernization that swept an archaic guild-like system,dating from Napoleonic times, into the age of electronicscreens and global markets.   Brokers and investors alike are alarmed at theauthorities' inability to settle the affair, and expressconcern that it could stain the Paris stock market'sreputation.   &quot;The affair is very harmful because it shows the market'sincapacity to settle the problem itself,&quot; says Jean deCholet, chairman of one of Paris's biggest brokerage firms,Cholet Dupont S.A. &quot;There is a legal vacuum which has existedsince the stockbroking reforms.&quot;   Two years ago, the Paris stockbrokers' associationscrapped its old code of &quot;All for one, one for all&quot;, whicheffectively guaranteed the profession would look after itsown, no matter the cost. This system was replaced withtoday's limited guarantee fund, which reimburses a bankruptbroker's clients to a 200 million franc ($38.6 million)eiling per brokerage firm, with additional limits onindividual payments per client.   But what happens when more than 200 million francs aremissing?   Last week a Paris commercial court tried to answer thequestion by ruling that Tuffier's new owners should pick upthe entire bill for all the brokerage firm's unsettledtrades.   Francis Lagarde and Jean-Francois Henin, the twobusinessmen who took over what was left of Tuffier inSeptember, had agreed at the time to contribute an additional135 million francs, alongside the guarantee fund's 200million francs, to pay out clients' claims, and to meet allthe unsettled trades.   But they ran straight into a dispute with the Bourseauthorities over a discrepancy between French bankruptcy lawand the fund-guarantee mechanism, focusing on whetherinstitutional creditors should be treated on an equal footingwith private investors.   Estimates on how much Tuffier could owe other brokersrange from 100 million to one billion francs, but no definitefigure is available. The issue was pressing enough to bringMessrs. Lagarde and Henin back to the commercial court toseek a ruling freeing them from the institutional clients'claims.   They failed. And the court's ruling against them couldprove explosive, because it might sink the entire rescueoperation. Faced with a potentially crippling bill, Mr.Lagarde (the chairman of holding company Cogespar) arguesthat his salvage operation can't be liable for all Tuffier'slosses and says he will appeal. &quot;If the appeal is rejected,we will renounce the Tuffier takeover,&quot; he was reported tosay last Friday as he left the court.   News reports of Mr. Lagarde's comments alarmed many of thesmall investors who saw themselves sold down the river as theTuffier rescue plan collapsed, victims of a dispute withinthe brokerage-community.   Since then, however, Mr. Lagarde's partner has tried tocalm things down. Mr. Henin, who heads Altus Finance (whichis owned by state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais), assuredTuffier clients in an open letter that he would respect allhis commitments to Tuffier.   But the clients are still waiting for their money. Altusand Cogespar say they have sent their 135 million franc checkto the payout fund, and the fund's administrator says he hasalready cashed a 200 million franc check paid in by theguarantee fund.   So, if the money is available, why can't the clients bepaid out now, if only partially? Alain Jausselme, one ofTuffier's new directors, says that the problem is both legaland administrative, and concerns individual clients' claimsas well as those of the institutional clients. &quot;It is allinterrelated,&quot; he says.   He explains that unsettled trades between the brokeragesmust first be cleared up in order to find some of the missingshares in clients' accounts. And the entire amount claimed bythe clients must be assessed before they can be reimbursed,even partially, on a pro-rata basis.   When Tuffier collapsed, its clients had some 5.5 billionfrancs, in either cash or shares, on its books. All theaccounts were immediately frozen for a month. When they werereopened in August, the clients were allowed to reclaimstock, but cash accounts remained frozen, and no one couldtouch those stock lines where the number of shares inTuffier's account at the clearing house didn't match itsbooks.   No one today can say exactly how much is still blocked.But Colette Neuville, who heads an association of Tuffierclients, estimates that about 100 million francs of sharesare in fact missing, in addition to about 350 million francsfrozen in cash accounts.   However, she points out, one missing share is enough toblock an entire stock line. In other words, if just a fewshares in Michelin are missing from Tuffier's account withthe market's central clearing house, then no Tuffier clientscan recover any of their Michelin shares. &quot;That means 10times more than what is missing could be blocked,&quot; says Ms.Neuville. Or one billion francs' worth.</TEXT></DOC>
