This revision is in theform of a variance for six can coating lines at the Continental Can's Milwaukeeplant and a variance for two can coating lines at the Continental Can Racineplant. Both plants are located in Wisconsin.On September 9, 1986 (51 FR 32075), USEPA announced the availability ofthis revision to the Wisconsin SIP and took final action to approve it(51 FR 32075). In the notice, USEPA advised the public that it was deferringthe effective date of its approval for 60 days, until November 10, 1986,to provide an opportunity for submittal of comments on this revision. USEPAannounced that if within 30 days it received notice that someone wishedto submit adverse or critical comments, we would withdraw the approvaland begin a new rulemaking by proposing the action and establishing a 30-daycomment period. USEPA also published a general notice announcing this special``direct final'' procedure on September 4, 1981 (46 FR 44476).<ITAG tagnum="54">USEPA has received a December 3, 1986, letter from a commentor whichlists some of its concerns regarding this proposed SIP revision. This alsoconstitutes the commentor's notice of its intention to submit criticalcomments regarding the approval. Therefore, in accordance with the proceduredescribed above, USEPA is today taking final action elsewhere in today's</ITAG><T4>Federal Register</T4> to withdraw its September 9, 1986, approval ofthis revision to Wisconsin Ozone SIP and, in this notice, is proposingto approve this revision.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The Continental Can Company has can manufacturing plants in two citiesin Wisconsin, Milwaukee and Racine. Both facilities are subject to therequirements for can coating operations identified at NR 154.13(4)(c) ofthe Wisconsin Administrative Code. On November 14, 1984, Continental Canrequested permission from the State to use internal offsets as a methodof compliance for each of the two facilities. One internal offset wouldbe applicable to six can coating lines at the Milwaukee plant, and anotherwould be applicable two can coating lines at the Racine plant. The WisconsinDepartment of Natural Resources (WDNR) approved the use of internal offsetsfor both plants, subject to certain conditions, and submitted the offsetsto USEPA as a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision on August 20, 1985.A discussion of the SIP revision is presented below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Internal Offset </ITAG>Continental Can Company has proposed the use of internal offsets at bothits Milwaukee and Racine facilities, meaning that the VOC emissions fromeach facility would be limited to a daily weighted average emission limitfrom all can coating lines at that facility, as determined by the formulaidentified at NR 154.13(13)(b) of the Wisconsin Administrative Code. Theinternal offset allows Continental Can credit for those coatings and coatinglines that reduce, to offset emissions from other coatings and coatinglines that exceed the SIP-allowable limit. The emissions allowed by theinternal offsets are equivalent to those that would occur if each coatingused were at the limits specified in the SIP. The daily weighted averagechanges daily as production levels change. The combined emissions fromall the coating lines at each facility have to meet that facility's computeddaily weighted average for that day. The daily weighted average is computedusing the allowable emission rate for each coating or printing line, asdefined in section NR 154.13(4)(c) of the Wisconsin Administrative Code.The proposed compliance plan also specifies maximum hourly VOC emissionlimits for each coating line, as required by NR 154.13(13)(b)2.a. of theWisconsin Administrative Code. These limits cannot be exceeded regardlessof changes in production. In addition, Continental Can is required to keep records of coating andsolvent characteristics, as well as daily consumption of solvent and coatings,for both plants. The daily weighted average is federally enforceable, baseupon this recordkeeping requirement which specifies that these recordsbe available for inspection, as well as the emission limits contained inNR 154.13(4)(c). Continental Can has developed a computer program to aidthe calculation of actual and allowable emissions and the scheduling ofproduction, in order to comply with the emission limits contained in NR154.13(4)(c). This computer program was developed based on the December8, 1980 (45 FR 80824), <T4>Federal Register, </T4>which contains USEPA's policy regarding compliancewith VOC emission limitations for can coaters.  The proposed compliance plan is subject to the following conditions: (1) Continental Can will perform tests to determine the efficiencies ofthe capture system and emission reduction requipment of the sheet coatingline at the Milwaukee plant. (2) Continental Can will maintain records of coating and solvent characteristics,as well as daily consumption of coatings and solvents, for both plants.The records will contain sufficient detail for the WDNR to determine compliancewith the daily allowable emissions rate. These records will be maintainedat each facility and will be available for inspection. The internal offsets became effective in the State of Wisconsin on September11, 1985, when a civil enforcement action filed by USEPA against ContinentalCan was resolved. A consent decree was lodged on that date.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>USEPA has reviewed a compliance plan for the Continental Can Company whichconsists of internal offsets for two can manufacturing plants located inMilwaukee and Racine, respectively. The compliance plan incorporates theuse of a daily weighted average at each plant, a computer program to aidin emission calculation and production scheduling, as well as specifiedtesting and recordkeeping conditions. However, the variances do not explicityidentify test methods to be used to determine capture and control efficienciesof control equipment and VOC content of coating. USEPA has determined thatthe proposed compliance plan meets USEPA's requirements for air pollutioncontrol from can coating operations. USEPA has also determined that theuse of internal offsets at the two facilities will not cause an increasein VOC emissions and, consequently, will not interfere with attainmentof the ozone NAAQS in southeastern Wisconsin. Therefore, USEPA is proposingapproval of the internal offsets contingent upon WNDR specifying the testmethods to be used in determining compliance. It should be noted that Milwaukee and Racine are both included (as partof the Milwaukee Metropolitan Statistical Area) in Appendix A of the November24, 1987, Proposed Post-1987 Ozone Policy (52 FR 45044). Table A-1 in AppendixA lists ``Potential 1988 SIP Areas-Ozone.'' Milwaukee is listed as an areawhich will exceed the Ozone standard in the period from 1985-1987. Finally,on May 26, 1988, USEPA notified the governor of Wisconsin that WisconsinOzone SIP is substantial inadequate to assure attainment of the Ozone NAAQS.Interested persons are invited to submit comments on this proposed approval.USEPA will consider all comments received within 30 days of the publicationof this notice.  Under 5 U.S.C. section 605(b), the Administrator has certified that SIPapprovals do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities (See 46 FR 8709). The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Valdas V.
