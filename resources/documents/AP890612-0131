The last symbol of the popular uprising, an 8-foot model of theStatue of Liberty that had been paraded around the streets lastmonth, was torn down Monday at the direction of the city government.   The styrofoam statue stood for the past few weeks at Shanghai'sFudan University, about 100 yards away from a statue of communistChina's founder, Mao Tse-tung.   Many protest leaders have gone into hiding or left the city asauthorities sweep through Shanghai, making arrests that are reportedin official media. Students also have reported many arrests.   Protests in Shanghai continued after Chinese troops broke upstudent protests in Beijing on June 3-4. About 3,000 people died inthe capital, most of them students, according to Chinese and Westerndiplomatic estimates. The Chinese government says 300 died, most ofthem soldiers.   Martial law has been in effect in Beijing since May 20, but hasnot been declared elsewhere in China during the crisis.   But widespread arrests were reported.   ``They're arresting students, so all our leaders have run off,''said a student at Fudan University, which along with Shanghai'sTongji University is considered the most activist. ``It's all overfor now. But they'll be back.''   A fellow student said the government frightened students intogoing underground. ``As soon as the government makes a serious movelike arresting people, no one dares show his face,'' he said.   The protests in Shanghai, while large, lacked the fervor of theemotional demonstrations in Beijing.   ``After a few marches we don't have the momentum that Beijinghas,'' said a 21-year-old factory worker. ``They're at the center ofgovernment, and that keeps them going.''   Security authorities have rounded up at least 150 people inShanghai in the last three days, mostly workers who took part instreet demonstrations, according to state-run media reports.   Warnings to students appeared in Shanghai newspapers Monday,ordering student ``masterminds'' to disband the outlawed Shanghaiindependent student union and turn themselves in.   One of those reported arrested in China's press was identified asYao Yongzhan, a Fudan University student who heads an outlawedstudent union. A resident of Hong Kong, he was stopped at Shanghai'sairport Sunday when he showed up for a flight to Hong Kong withseveral British students and British consulate officials.   ``We did not know anything about him until he appeared yesterdaymorning saying he hadn't gotten enough money,'' a spokesman for theBritish Embassy in Beijing said. The consulate in Shanghai loanedYao money and gave him a ride to the airport, the spokesman said.   Police have also cracked down on workers who helped students movedozens of buses into place last week, creating havoc on Shanghai'salready swollen streets. Eleven leaders of the banned labor unionhave been arrested, according to police.   ``Since the formation of the workers' autonomous union, membershave carried out activities ... opposing the people's government,disrupting social order, economy and public safety, and destroyingpublic property,'' the Liberation Daily quoted an unidentifiedShanghai police official as saying.   On Friday, 50,000 people marched in Shanghai in the largestprotest since the assault in Beijing. Students gave the government48 hours to begin direct talks with the students on publicizing thedemocracy movement and the events in Beijing, and to lower flags inShanghai to half-staff.   But the government ignored the ultimatum, and the studentshaven't ventured forth since.   On Monday night, about 200 workers recruited by the government tomaintain security gathered at the gates of the Tongji campus. Theyinsisted they were there to keep traffic flowing smoothly.   They had been in place since 6:00 a.m. Sunday, clearly to preventTongji students from marching out of the school as the 48-hourdeadline aproached.   Much information about the protests outside of governmentchannels appears to be coming from Hong Kong, the British colonyscheduled to revert to Chinese rule in 1997.   Supporters of the movement in Hong Kong regularly send to Chinaby facsimile machines copies of Hong Kong newspaper stories aboutthe democracy movement.</TEXT></DOC>
