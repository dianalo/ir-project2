The semiconductor detector(HP-Ge) was calibrated and tested for field measurements of natural andartificial radionuclides distributed on/in the soil. The method and itsapplication is discussed, the way of calibration and some of the modelcalculations are presented as well as results of intercomparison measurementswith the Health Physics Department of the Central Research Institutefor Physics in Budapest. 19 refs., 10 figs., 14 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
