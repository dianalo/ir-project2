Both markets reacted early in the day to a rise Friday in theU.S. prime lending rate, which pushed the dollar higher butdepressed stock prices. The stock market also reacted negatively tolocal political developments.   The dollar, which fell 1.74 yen last Friday to a closing of127.65 yen, gained back 0.65 yen on Monday, closing at 128.30 yen.   After opening at 128.50 yen, the dollar weakened on mid-morningselling, recovered and later sagged as several banks sold thecurrency to protect their bond holdings, said Kaneo Ogino, a traderat Goldman Sachs. It traded in a range of 128.20-128.63 yen.   An increase in the prime lending rate from 10.5 percent to 11percent by many American commercial banks and news of anunexpectedly high U.S. producer price index for January, bothannounced Friday, combined to spur the dollar's early rally, said adealer at the Bank of Tokyo.   ``Now everyone's paying attention to interest-rate differentialsand inflation, which should be good for the dollar,'' Ogino said.   Higher U.S. interest rates tend to make the dollar moreattractive to foreign investors.   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225selected issues, a 53.56-point gainer Friday, closed 146.67 points,or 0.4 percent, lower at 31,985.32. It finished last week at arecord high 32,131.99 points.   Share prices declined in reaction to the interest rate hike andto the governing Liberal Democratic Party's loss Sunday in a closelywatched parliamentary by-election, said Kazuhiro Nakamura of WakoSecurities.   ``After the LDP's severe defeat and six straight days of (stockindex) increase, investors felt it was time to ease off,'' Nakamurasaid.   The election to fill the seat of a Liberal Democrat who died inDecember was the first race for a national office since theso-called Recruit stock scandal over financial links between RecruitCo. and prominent politicians and bureaucrats came to light.   The election also was seen as an indication of public opiniontoward the governing party following the passage of a long-soughttax reform package in December that included introduction of anunpopular 3 percent sales tax.</TEXT></DOC>
