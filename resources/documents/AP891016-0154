AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government started cutting thepublic payroll with dismissals Monday and Gen. Manuel AntonioNoriega rearranged military ranks thinned by disloyalty.   Noriega, who commands the Panamanian Defense Forces and runs thecountry, named close associates to several key posts over theweekend but many important positions, including the chief ofintelligence, remained open.   Col. Guillermo Wong, the former intelligence chief, was amongthose arrested after an unsuccessful coup Oct. 3. Failure toreplace him suggested Noriega may be having trouble finding enoughtrustworthy senior officers.   Gustavo Gonzalez, the planning and economic policy minister,told journalists Monday there would be no ``massive firings'' ofpublic employees but said the public payroll must be reduced.   ``We do not have a budget,'' he told reporters at a luncheonwith the Bankers Association. ``We are operating on a cash flowbasis and that flow is now about 50 per cent of what it was twoyears ago.''   Panama's economy has been hurt badly by U.S. economic sanctionsimposed after Noriega was indicted on U.S. drug trafficking andmoney laundering charges in February 1988.   Noriega claims the charges and the coup attempt are part of aU.S. plot to remove him and keep the Panama Canal, which by treatyis to be turned over to Panama at the end of 1999.   Bankers Association president Edgardo Lasso said lack ofconfidence caused by the sanctions and political instability hadcaused a serious recession. He denied Panama was a center forlaundering drug money.   Gonzalez said high public officials had taken salary reductionsranging from 20 to 30 percent, and ``that includes Gen. Noriega.''   One public employee told journalists she and four others hadbeen accused of ``conspiring against the state'' Monday and fired.   Government officials, including Noriega, urged the dismissal ofpublic employees who celebrated or showed disloyalty while theattempted coup was in process.   ``War laws'' announced by Noriega after the coup includedisloyalty among the reasons for dismissal of public employees.   The government said an International Monetary Fund mission wasarriving to ``evaluate the country's situation and study measuresthe government is considering to improve the economic situation.''   Panama's foreign debt is $3.8 billion and it is $1.2 billionbehind in payments on interest and principal.   Capt. Rafael Gaytan, for two years the director of Noriega'spersonal security, was named head of the Special Anti-TerroristForces, an elite unit said to have been blocked by U.S. forces fromaiding Noreiga the day of the coup.   Capt. Rafael Cedeno, another officer close to Noriega, was nameddeputy director of intelligence. Cedeno has worked closely withNoriega since the early '80s.   Capt. Rafael Jurado became commander of the 2nd Military Zonenear the Costa Rican border and Col. Roberto Armijo was nameddirector of personnel, replacing Col. Julio Ow Young, arrested inconnection with the coup.</TEXT></DOC>
