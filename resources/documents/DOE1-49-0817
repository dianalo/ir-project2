<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-49-0817 </DOCNO><TEXT>A review of the different models explaining the radio emission of young(pre-main sequence) stars is presented. These are either ''thermal''(bremsstrahlung from HII regions, winds, accretion flows...) or ''non-thermal''(gyrosynchrotron radiation from flares). Observational diagnostics suchas spectra, timescales of variability, and spatial extent, are discussedin detail within the framework of these various possibilities. In thelight of recent observations performed with the Very Large Array, possibleinterpretations of a few representative cases are suggested, includingT Tau(S), DoAr 21 and other objects in the Rho Ophiuchi cloud.</TEXT></DOC>
