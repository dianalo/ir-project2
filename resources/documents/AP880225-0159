Several of the members also had strong criticism for PresidentReagan, who in a Wednesday night news conference said South Africanunrest results from ``a tribal policy more than it is a racialpolicy.''   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the House ForeignAffairs Africa subcommittee, scheduled five days of hearings nextmonth and said he hoped to bring a strong sanctions bill to thefloor by mid-April or earlier.   ``Additional sanctions are the only peaceful means for the Westto hammer home to Pretoria that the West will not permit the voicesof opposition to expire,'' Wolpe said at a news conference.   He called the white minority government's decision to outlaweven peaceful dissent ``yet one more step towards absolutetotalitarian government control over South Africa's non-whitemajority. The South African regime leaves no doubt of itsdetermination to systematically deny any and all forms oflegitimate protest, to criminalize what we in the United Statesknow are basic human rights.''   Wolpe noted that South African Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutuhad appealed to Western nations to step up anti-apartheid sanctionsin response to the latest crackdown, and said his committee wouldbegin working on a tough sanctions package sponsored by Rep. RonDellums, D-Calif.   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, criticized Reagan's news-conferencecomment as ``very insensitive and lacking any sense of history.This is an issue of democracy. This administration has to stand upon this issue. It can't just slough it off.''   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., said of Reagan: ``His idea of SouthAfrica is that of a 1930s Tarzan movie.''   Wolpe noted that the State Department had protested the latestcrackdown on dissent by anti-apartheid groups. But he added, ``themoment has arrived for the Reagan administration to back its wordswith action.''</TEXT></DOC>
