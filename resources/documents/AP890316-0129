Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said he wasnot at liberty to discuss the specific computer networks the Germanhackers penetrated, what they learned in the process and what theypassed on to the Warsaw Pact.   But, in breaking two weeks of official silence, Howard said theDefense Department no longer viewed the case as a serious threat tomilitary security.   ``Based on the information that we have thus far, and this is notcomplete ... our best judgment is that the computer hackers did notpenetrate secure programs,'' Howard said.   The initial review of evidence assembled by American and WestGerman authorities suggests the spy ring never gained access to thecomputer systems that contain classified secrets, he continued.   ``All this is subject to change should new information turn up inthe course of the investigation. But, to the best of our knowledge,it does not appear at this point that there was any compromise ofclassified information,'' Howard said.   The West German government broke up the computer espionageoperation March 3, arresting three individuals and later disclosingthat eight others were still under investigation.   On March 6, a spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor in WestGermany, Alexander Prechtel, told reporters the continuinginvestigation suggested ``the information obtained by the hackersdoes not appear to be that sensitive.''   The U.S. government, however, had declined until Thursday to saywhether it agreed with that assessment.   The West German ring was cracked in large measure through thework of a lone U.S. computer expert, an astronomer named CliffordStoll. Stoll has said he observed the ring trying to break intoabout 450 computer banks, and that the hackers did gain access tothe Pentagon's general data bank, named Optimus, as well ascomputers at several defense contractors and U.S. military bases.   West Germany's ARD television network has reported the hackersalso tapped NASA and ``Star Wars'' research computers. Citingunidentified sources, the network reported that three hackers handedover information from the United States, Japan, Britain, France,Italy, Switzerland and West Germany during a 1985 meeting with twoKGB agents in East Berlin.   The TV network also reported that authorities believe the WestGerman hackers were recruited by the Soviet intelligence agency in1985 and ``were paid with cash and drugs.''   Howard, while breaking the U.S. government's silence on thematter, declined to confirm precisely which computer databanks thehackers penetrated.   ``No classified programs. That's really about all I can say onthe subject,'' he replied.   ``I don't have any information that would imply there was anyinvolvement by Americans,'' Howard added.</TEXT></DOC>
