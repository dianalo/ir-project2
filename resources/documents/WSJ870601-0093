GreenbergerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/01/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTAEROSPACE (ARO)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Amid heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf, the Reagan administration notified Congress that it plans to sell 1,600 Maverick air-to-ground missiles, valued at $360 million, to Saudi Arabia.    The administration, apparently trying to speed through Congress what is expected to be a controversial sale, sent lawmakers the required 30-day advance notification late Friday, according to congressional sources. Under a 1976 agreement between Congress and the executive branch, administrations customarily have given legislators an informal 20-day advance notification of such sales before the required 30-day period begins.    The congressional sources said the White House asserts that the Mavericks are part of a 1984 sale of those missiles that Congress didn't oppose. The Saudis, however, never took delivery of the missiles.    Under arms-sales procedures, if Congress doesn't block the sale during the 30 days, the administration may ship the weapons to the Saudis.    Opposition to the latest sale is expected to be intense. Many members of Congress complain that the Saudis appear reluctant to participate actively in the U.S. effort to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers from attacks by Iran in the Persian Gulf. The administration currently is placing 11 Kuwaiti tankers under the U.S. flag, and is seeking logistical support -- including the use of air strips -- from Saudi Arabia and other gulf states.    Members of Congress also are angry at the Saudis for failing last month to respond when U.S. military officers requested that two Saudi F-15 jet fighters on routine patrol intercept an Iraqi Mirage jet that had inadvertently attacked the USS Stark, killing 37 U.S. sailors. The administration said the Saudi pilots didn't get authorization from their command center quickly enough to intercept the Mirage.    After that incident, the administration late last month postponed notifying Congress that it intended to sell Saudi Arabia 12 F-15 jet fighters to replace damaged or destroyed F-15s.    Earlier, on the weekend of the attack on the Stark, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or Aipac, the main pro-Israel lobby, publicly warned the White House that it would oppose such a missile sale to the Saudis. Thomas Dine, the group's executive director, said then that &quot;Aipac wants to avoid a confrontation with this friendly president and friendly secretary of state, but it must oppose this arms sale.&quot; The group is certain to oppose a Maverick sale as well.    Further, 30 senators reportedly have signed a letter, currently circulating on Capitol Hill, that opposes selling arms to the Saudis right now.    &quot;This would not strike me as the time to make Saudi arms sales,&quot; said a Senate aide. He added that the administration's decision to go ahead with the Maverick sale might represent an attempt to coax the kingdom into closer cooperation with the U.S. in its plan to protect Kuwaiti ships.    The administration wants to sell the Saudis the Maverick-D missile, a more-sophisticated version of the earlier Mavericks that the administration offered the Saudis in 1984, according to the congressional sources. The sources added that the Saudis didn't accept the earlier Mavericks in 1984 because they wanted the more-advanced version.    Last year, the administration narrowly won approval of a sale of missiles to Saudi Arabia only after it removed from the package Stinger missiles. Opponents of that sale claimed that the shoulder-held Stingers easily could be acquired by terrorists. </TEXT></DOC>
