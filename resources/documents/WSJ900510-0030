The Korean government sent a letter this week to thePentagon saying final negotiations for the Korea FighterProject had hit a snag because of what it called U.S. refusalto compromise on the technology transfer issue.</LP><TEXT>   In Washington, Pentagon officials said both governmentshave invested too much effort and political capital in theproject to pull out at the last minute. One official familiarwith the project suggested that the South Korean letter maybe designed to win last-minute concessions from the U.S. Hesaid South Korea would face the same restrictions that applyto the McDonnell Douglas plane if it opted for any otherU.S.-made aircraft.   The Koreans are threatening to delay or even scuttle thedeal to buy 12 McDonnell Douglas Corp. F/A-18 jet fightersmade in the U.S., assemble 36 more from U.S.made kits andco-produce 72 more jets in Korea under the direction of theSt. Louis company. Seoul chose the McDonnell Douglas jet overGeneral Dynamics Corp.'s F-16 last December.   People in the U.S. military say the dispute overtechnology transfer surprised them, because negotiations werealmost completed and documents were expected to be signed atthe end of this month. &quot;We had a draft document that everyonehad high confidence in,&quot; one person said.   But the U.S. doesn't want to give in to Korea'slast-minute demands. &quot;It is our understanding that we have aframework for a memorandum of understanding. The U.S. willstand by what is in the original agreement,&quot; a Pentagonspokesman said. &quot;There are obstacles, but they aren'tobstacles to scuttle the agreement.&quot;   An accord hashed out over months of negotiations in 1988and 1989 allowed Korean companies to license U.S. technologyso they could learn how to build planes themselves and yetnot infuriate a Congress grown wary of creating competitorsfor U.S. business. Such coproduction arrangements arecommonplace with other countries.   But Korea now wants technology that the U.S. has kept on arestricted list. Korea's wish-list includes the jets' radarwarning device, the radar itself, composite materialstechnology, the high-heat-tolerant parts of the engines thatrequire special metallurgical skills and the top-secretsoftware for the on-board computer. &quot;The U.S. has taken theposition that certain things shouldn't be transferred,&quot; amilitary official in Seoul said.   The new demands could delay the project for at least ayear if they aren't resolved before June 5, when the pact issupposed to start wending its way through Congress on aspecial track to ease passage. And because the U.S. is takinga hard-line position on the technology issue, the Koreans aresaid to have threatened to scuttle the whole deal and beginthe process of picking a new fighter. The selection of theF/A-18 took almost two years.   The KFP project was expected to get through Congress withlittle difficulty. But the new demands put that in jeopardy,say officials in Washington, because it would give newammunition to the tiny, but vocal, forces in Congress thatoppose the coproduction deal. &quot;It is off the screen rightnow. But all it needs is another incident for the issue tocome back stronger than ever,&quot; said Clyde Prestowitz, a tradeexpert and a critic of the fighter project because of thetechnology involved. Adds a Pentagon spokesman, &quot;Technologytransfer is certainly a sensitive issue in the administrationand in Congress.&quot;   Similar technologies were at the center of a controversylast year over the Japanese FSX project, the codevelopment ofa new-generation fighter. The FSX sparked strong oppositionin Congress and the Commerce Department, though it wasapproved.   Officials of the Korean Ministry of Defense refusedcomment, saying everyone involved in the matter was out ofthe country, including Maj. Gen. Lee Woo Shik, who signed theletter to the Pentagon. Kim Chong Whi, the president'sadviser for national security, who is said to be behind theplan, refused comment and referred the issue to anothergeneral, who also happened to be out of the country.High-ranking Korean military officials are scheduled to be inWashington next week for regular consultations, and U.S.military officials said this issue was sure to come up.   Government officials also wouldn't comment on whether thechange in position is the result of a conflict between Mr.Kim, the presidential adviser and a hard-liner in the rulingDemocratic Liberal Party, and Minister of National DefenseLee Sang Hun over control of defense policy.   The fighter-plane controversy probably poses little threatto McDonnell Douglas. The company declined to comment on whata delay might mean. A spokesman said only, &quot;We hope that thetwo sides will be able to resolve any remainingtechnology-transfer issues soon.&quot; Americans say there islittle chance that the Koreans would carry out their threatto scuttle the deal.   Opposition to the pact has been strong in Korea even afterthe two governments came to terms last summer. Nationalistsinside the government said the U.S. forced Korea to give uptoo much, particularly because the deal calls for it to buyoff-the-shelf and because the U.S. need only buy back 30% ofthe contract's total value in Korean goods under a systemknown as &quot;offset.&quot; It is common in military-equipment salesfor the offset to be closer to 100%.   The issue hasn't died down as it did in the U.S. Only afew weeks ago the Dong-Ah Ilbo, an influential Seoulnewspaper, said, &quot;Korea is placed at a disadvantage with theterms of the contract when compared to other countries whopurchase expensive arms.&quot;   Said a U.S. military official, &quot;It is an arrangement thatis just as good as anyone gets. They are getting nothing lessthan the Spanish or the Australians {two other countries thathave licensed coproduction deals with the U.S.}.&quot;   Korea's aerospace industry is undeveloped, and governmentofficials made no secret that the fighter deal was designedto help it develop a commercial aircraft industry. The keyreason McDonnell Douglas won the contract was that thegovernment thought the company had a better plan to developthe Korean industry.</TEXT></DOC>
