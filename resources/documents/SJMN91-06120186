They get together to discuss the globaleconomic situation and to determine whether it calls for coordinated action.;   The statement issued after Sunday's session appeared to be an effort topaper over the differences that the various countries had aired withincreasing force in recent days and to allow all sides to claim victory. Itgave a nod to the importance of economic growth, as argued by the UnitedStates, but also to the need to keep prices stable -- the chief concern ofGermany and Japan.;    U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady insisted that hewas not disappointed with the results.;    &quot;I think the communique speaks veryclearly about the combination of growth and trying to provide for this world,and for our various economies, sustained policies which will add to thatgrowth,&quot; he told reporters.;    Yet the &quot;medium-term strategy&quot; spelled out inthe document did not give the United States what it had wanted.;    Asrecently as Thursday, Bush had declared: &quot;We want to see these interest ratesdown a little bit. . . . I think that would be good for the world economy,including our own.&quot; In particular, administration officials have argued thatreal interest rates -- rates after inflation is taken into account -- are atrecord highs in Germany and Japan.;    The timing of the Group of Sevenmeeting was significant, coming only two days after a report that showed theU.S. economy had slid deeper into recession during the first quarter.;   Administration officials contend that lower interest rates in other countrieswould spur demand and economic growth worldwide. A major beneficiary of such apolicy presumably would be the United States.;    Yet economic officials fromother countries, led by Germany and Japan, argue that cutting rates is notnecessary at a time when their economies remain robust.;    These nationsinsist that if the United States wants to drive down the cost of credit, itshould do so by other means.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910429  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  450  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 29, 199100120186,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
