Equal Employment Opportunity CommissionInformation SystemsGovernment AgencyUpgrading.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Small Agency Sees Problem, Creates OpportunityandM;Many agencies have millions of dollars availale to build information systemsand still cannot get past their procurement protests, but the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission developed a national database system withno extra funding and no particular congressional support for the task.andM;When EEOC's current chairman, Clarence Thomas, joined the commission in 1982its financial, personnel and company discrimination enforcement systems werewoefully inadequate.andP;  &quot;When we developed budgets for OMB or Capital Hill wecould not get the columns to add up, we could not get the workloads to addup, we could not get the personnel numbers to add up, [and] we could not getthe obligations to add up,&quot; Thomas said in an interview with GCN.andM;The EEOC first had to solve problems with its payroll and personnel systems,then officials went on to develop a master data system at headquarters tostore massive amounts of information related to company discrimination cases.andO;Field offices and local public agencies needed a better way to access datanecessary for their cases, Thomas said.andM;The EEOC has had &quot;enormous difficulty&quot; managing cases, which are the chargesfiled with EEOC, Thomas said.andP;  District managers despised the old ComplaintStatistical Retrieval System (CSRS).andM;With CSRS, managers used dumb terminals to input work load information toheadquarters, which would send back quarterly paper copies.andP;  Managers wouldhave to verify and reconcile the computer printout with what they were doingdaily.andM;Up to a PointandM;CSRS did give EEOC an information base to do budgets and, up to a point,respond to requests from Congress.andP;  But the system was not reliable enough toproduce accurate information, Thomas said.andM;Headquarters finally was forced to make offices submit a more reliable manualreport along with the automated CSRS report, Seal said.andM;In 1985 EEOC officials decided to change CSRS.andP;  A new system had to startwith a basis in the field and could not be a central data system usable onlyfrom that location.andP;  Besides the district offices, about 70 Fair EmploymentPractices Offices, area offices and local offices had to be linked to thesystem.andM;Officials used NCR Corp. MiniTower multiuser computers, which can support upto six dumb terminals and had the capacity to store data in a district officeand allow field office workers to create management reports.andM;The UNIX-based MiniTowers have from 512K to 2M of memory and are built arounda 10-MHz Motorola Corp. 68010 processor.andM;EEOC installed IBM XTs in the local and area offices because it was a lessexpensive way to provide similar systems to those users, Thomas said.andM;The MiniTowers used the Filepro database management system language, soprograms had to be rewritten for the PCs.andP;  &quot;We basically had to write thesame reports twice,&quot; Seal said.andM;The next step was to develop a central system and get the 70 FEPA offices onthe system.andP;  However, &quot;they did not wave flags and cheer us on,&quot; Thomas said.andM;About a year ago EEOC district offices upgraded to the NCR Tower 32/600supermicrocomputers.andP;  The computers sat in a warehouse for a while becausethe agency did not have the money to install the systems, Thomas said.andM;Employees assembled the equipment at headquarters and installed it in thedistrict offices on weekends and after hours, Thomas said.andP;  Field technicianstook the MiniTowers to the local offices and installed them, he said.andM;Finally, Filepro and NCR were used in the area, local and district officesand &quot;there was no language barrier,&quot; Thomas said.andM;The Charge Data System (CDS) is the successor to CSRS.andP;  Within CDS is thenational database with the aggregate information, and each local office has alocal database, said Leo Sanchez, chief of EEOC's CDS Division.andM;CDS links multiuser computers in field offices and local agencies through amaster data system at the commission's Washington, D.C.andP;  headquarters.andM;National DatabaseandM;The national database contains about 1.2 million historical documents datingback to 1979 and 380,000 active records averaging about 2,000 characters,Seal said.andM;The database is updated weekly, and soon the agency will update it daily,Thomas said.andM;EEOC created a minifile so district offices can look at subsets of data fromthe local and area offices and in April the agency will have a minifile forthe district offices to look at the state offices, Seal said.andM;The minifile is an abbreviated record of each charge filed in the district,Sanchez said.andP;  The record reduces the need for the district office to look atthe central national database, he said.andM;The minifile is maturing in the district offices, and soon offices will beable to dial up other offices and receive report information, Sanchez said.andM;Local offices can change their database but cannot see other local databases,and headquarters cannot change the databases, Seal said.andM;In the past EEOC could not afford the hardware to store on site all data thatcame in from the field offices.andP;  Data was brought in through a collectionmanager and sent first to Martin Marietta Corp., then in later years to theDepartment of Health and Human Services' Parklawn Computer Center inRockville, Md.andM;Although its fiscal 1988 budget was cut, EEOC officials decided to eliminatethe offsite central data system at Parklawn, which did not offer adequateflexibility and was based on a different database package -- the RAMIS 22database management system, Thomas said.andM;The agency planned to handle the data with a leased NCR 32/850supermicrocomputer.andP;  The computer had been announced but was not beingshipped, so NCR gave EEOC an upgraded 32/800, Thomas said.andM;The 32-bit 32/800 multiprocessor supports about 108 users, while the 32/850supports 512 users, said Kenneth White, EEOC's CDS consultant.andP;  About 64users are now on the system, he said.andM;The 32/800 supports up to 64M of main memory, 850M of disk storage and 128devices andperforms about 8 million instructions per second.andM;The 32/850 will store up to 4.8 gigabytes on-line.andP;  The UNIX-based systemfeatures from 8M to 96M of main memory, supports up to 512 users and isconfigured with four Motorola 68020-based processors.andM;EEOC, long the agency with the obsolete equipment, is the first agency to usea 32/800 and will be the first to use the 32/850, Seal said.andM;&quot;Finally we have from beginning to end the same language and the sameequipment,&quot; Thomas said.andP;  &quot;We have a system that is intact and responsive forthe first time.&quot;andM;The system was brought up in January and is totally functional.andP;  A file canbe brought up by the charge number, charge party or respondent name, Thomassaid.andP;  Within seconds, the user can see the last action on a case and thestatus of the case.andM;&quot;No one ever thought EEOC would have the capacity to have that instantaneousretrieval on a national level,&quot; Thomas said.andP;  &quot;Now we have that on a locallevel.&quot;andM;EEOC also is writing programs that will show all the charges made against aparticular company, Thomas said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
