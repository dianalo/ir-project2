The particular multi-FLEX considered consists of eight clustersof FLEX-32 multiprocessors. The concept of execution domains is introducedto model the three levels of memory on these machines: local, locallyshared, and global. The method of stochastic high-level Petri nets (SHLPN)is appliedto model the performance of these PDE splitting algorithmson a Multi-FLEX machine. For very large, but realistic, applicationspotential speedup to 300 for 2D problems and more for 3D problems isprojected, along with processor utilization of over 90%. Real computationson real machines can fall far short of this potential and still be verysuccessful.</TEXT></DOC>
