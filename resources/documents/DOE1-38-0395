Three simple configurations arestudied: uniform flow, shear flow and pure plane strain. The experimentaldata are discussed and compared to a second-order closure model, derivedfrom that of Launder in single phase flow and specially designed to takeinterfacial terms into account. Finally it is shown how part of the aboveexperimental information can be used to set up a semi empirical modelfor the analytical determination of both heat transfer and friction coefficientson the wall of a slender body or a pipe in contact with a bubbly flowon the condition that the bubbles are large enough.</TEXT></DOC>
