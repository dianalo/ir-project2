 The agreements went a long way toward reconciling thedifferences that had strained relations between IBM and Microsoft early in1990.andP;  They did not eliminate completely however, differences between IBM andMicrosoft regarding their priorities for Windows and OS/2.andP;  IBM stillobviously preferred direct migration to OS/2's Presentation Manager wheneverpossible.andP;  Microsoft, on the other hand, continued to emphasize Windows.andM;Microsoft had for some time encouraged software developers to concentrate onWindows products rather than developing for the OS/2 Presentation Manager.andO;Shortly after the highly-anticipated September 17 announcement of theexpanded licensing agreement and reallocation of primary developmentresponsibilities for Windows and OS/2, Microsoft explicitly and publiclypromised to broaden support for Windows applications on OS/2.andM;Two parts of that improved support had already been announced.andP;  First, theWindows to OS/2 software migration kit (SMK) was available.andP;  The SMK is atool for translating Windows programs into OS/2 Presentation Manager programsby mapping Windows application program interface (API) calls to PresentationManager API calls.andM;The second part was a strong reaffirmation by Microsoft to provide a binarycompatibility layer (BCL) for OS/2 2.0 to permit the direct execution ofWindows binary programs.andP;  While the SMK translates a Windows program into anOS/2 PM program, the BCL will give OS/2 the ability to run a Windows programinterpretively as an OS/2 PM program.andM;The third part of Microsoft's promises for broader Windows support on OS/2was new: the intention to support the Windows API directly on the &quot;portable&quot;version of OS/2.andP;  Windows applications will run on this  &quot;future&quot; OS/2, whichshould not be confused with IBM's Version 1.3, without the inefficiencies ofemulation overhead and other potential limitations of the BCL.andP;  Microsoft hasmade it clear that the future &quot;portable&quot; version of OS/2, whose developmentremained the primary responsibility of Microsoft, would be not only fornon-Intel architectures, but would eventually replace the OS/21  x and 2.0versions (for which IBM had assumed primary responsibility) on Intel-basedsystems, as wen.andM;In fact, Microsoft began referring to what had previously been called eitherthe &quot;portable&quot; version of OS/2, the &quot;future&quot; version of OS/2, or OS/2NT (for&quot;new technology&quot;) simply as OS/2 3.0.andP;  The messages in that, while in severalrespects both complex and subtle, are nevertheless clear.andM;THE MEANING BEHIND OS/2 3.0andM;First of all, and contrary to some of the more hysterical accounts thatappeared in the trade press last fall, Microsoft had no intention ofabandoning OS/2.andP;  The versions for which IBM assumed primary responsibilitylast fall were the past  (1.x) and present (2.0) versions that were alreadyfinished.andP;  IBM was merely taking over the mundane tasks of final testing andquality assurance.andP;  It was far from &quot;seizing control&quot; of OS/2, as someclaimed.andP;  Microsoft has assumed the primary responsibility for OS/2 3.0, nowunder the direction of former DEC VAX VMS developer, David Cutler.andP;  Microsoftis more deeply involved in defining the future of the operating system thanIBM.andM;Second, it showed decisively the absurdity of the &quot;Windows versus OS/2&quot;scenario that some are tempted by even today.andP;  Microsoft had no reason toreinvent the wheel by turning a DOS-based Windows into a rival to OS/2.andP;  Thefar more sensible course, and the one Microsoft is obviously following, issimply to move Windows over from DOS onto OS/2.andM;For that is exactly what the software migration kit, the Windows binarycompatibility layer for OS/2 2.0, and the direct support of the Windows APIin OS/2 3.0 add up to: Windows for OS/2.andP;  Windows, far from being a rival toOS/2, will end up being virtually a part of OS/2.andM;Microsoft's third and final message behind OS/2 3.0 is that although there isno question of a rivalry between Windows and OS/2, Windows may be viewedloosely as a rival to the Presentation Manager, at least from the prospectivesoftware developer's perspective.andM;Given the promise of direct binary support for the Windows API on OS/2 3.0,it's possible that a software developer, whether an independent softwarevendor (ISV) or an in-house programmer, may choose to ignore the PresentationManager API entirely and simply write to the Windows API instead.andM;Even were that so, it would make relatively little difference to end users,since the &quot;look and feel&quot; of the application would not be affected, only theAPI used to create it.andM;Moreover, Microsoft is unlikely to drop support for the Presentation ManagerAPI in OS/2 3.0 as it expands the operating system to support Windows APIcalls.andP;  To do so would create some serious compatibility problems given thegrowing number of PM applications, as well as causing major problems forMicrosoft's relations with IBM.andM;Besides, what the Windows API most lacks are precisely those OS/2 servicesand capabilities already present in the PM API.andP;  The PM API provides a morelogically consistent model and set of naming conventions.andP;  Most programmersexperienced with both prefer the Presentation Manager API.andM;AN OS/2 FUTUREandM;Precisely how all this will work out depends in part on how the combinedWindows/PM API in OS/2 3.0 is implemented.andP;  It's unlikely that developerswill be able to mix Windows and PM API calls willy-nilly in the same program,since the two rely on different models for addressing and manipulating thedisplay space.andP;  My hunch is that any particular program will have to pickeither a PM or a Windows mode and stick with it, although a large number ofcalls may be common to both modes.andM;In any case, assuming Microsoft keeps its recent promises, the result forusers will be a far easier and more natural transition from DOS/windows toOS/2 than most have come to expect.andP;  The Windows binary compatibility layerin OS/2 2.0 (for which Microsoft remains the primary developer) and theability to run Windows as well as PM binaries directly on OS/2 3.0 willstreng then both Windows and OS/2 in the short term while greatly enhancingOS/2's longer term prospects.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
