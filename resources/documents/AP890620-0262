The Conference Board said the pool of young people will shrinksignificantly as the 20th century comes to a close due to a slowdownin the birth rate that began in the 1960s.   The number of people between the ages of 20 and 35 will fall byabout 10 million during the next 15 years from about 63 million in1985, forecasts say.   Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board'sconsumer research center, said over the past decade and a half youngpeople have been the biggest growth segment of the U.S. consumermarket.   ``But in the years ahead they will hold considerably less promisefor marketers of a wide variety of products and services,'' Lindensaid.   He estimated that currently one out of every four dollars oftotal household income flows to homes headed by persons under 35years old. The amount is expected to fall to less than one dollarout of every five by the year 2000.   However, the real buying power of this age group isn't expectedto contract.   ``The increase in average household earnings over the next decadewill offset the decline in the number of households,'' Linden said.``Additionally, because there will be fewer available Americanworkers between the ages of 20 and 35, they will likely receivehigher pay.''   The Conference Board is a nonprofit research-oriented groupsupported by businesses, trade and professional organizations,government agencies, unions and others.</TEXT></DOC>
