Explosions, structural defects on rigs and bad weather all havecontributed to the regular tragedies that plague the region.   The worst North Sea oil field disaster was in 1980, when 137crewmen on the accommodation platform Alexander I. Kielland died asit capsized in storms in the Norwegian Ekofisk area. Most of thedead were Norwegians.   Five years earlier, a ruptured pipeline on the same rig causedan explosion that killed three men.   The first North Sea spill was in April 1977, when at least 5.8million gallons of oil escaped into the sea from the oil rig Bravoin the Ekofisk field run by Phillips Petroleum.   Texas oilman Red Adair was brought in to cap the fracture. Ittook him and his team five attempts to cap the rig, but not beforea slick covered 1,500 square miles.   In November 1965, three people died and 11 others were injuredwhen an explosion ripped the bottom out of a North Sea oil drillingbarge at Teesport near Middlesbrough in northeast England.   In December 1965, 13 men died when the Sea Gem rig collapsed andsank.   In November 1981, the Transworld 58 platform was torn from itsmoorings and drifted for several hours in hurricane winds.Forty-four men were evacuated but another 20 remained trappedaboard the platform for several hours before being rescued. Therewere no casualties.   In 1982, one man was killed on the same Piper Alpha platforminvolved in Wednesday's disaster when a walkway collapsed.   In 1984, a fire on the production platform Brent Bravo killedthree workers when they were trapped in a shaft.   In 1985, two maintenance workers died in an explosion in thesemi-submersible rig Glomar Arctic II.   Last March, a total of 40 workers were winched by helicopterfrom two rigs that got into trouble in gales. The same night,another rig drifted off the Norwegian coast with 77 men aboard.   Last Friday, an explosion occurred at British Petroleum's SullomVoe North Sea oil terminal on the Shetland Islands, but no injurieswere reported.   On Tuesday, fire broke out on the North Sea Brent Alphaplatform. Again, no injuries were reported.   The Department of Energy said a total of 123 fixedinstallations, including the Piper Alpha platform involved inWednesday night's disaster, are currently in the British sector ofthe North Sea oil field.   The department said there are additionally about 40semi-submersible rigs and jack-up rigs in the British sector.   Semi-submersible rigs float and can travel under their ownpower, while four-legged jack-up rigs stand on the sea bottom andare generally used for exploration in shallower waters.</TEXT></DOC>
