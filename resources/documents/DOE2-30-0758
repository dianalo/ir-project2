In an effort to further understand themechanisms of fiber degradation, Nicalon fibers were heat treated attemperatures up to 2200 C and argon gas pressures varying from 0 to 1360atm. The effects of gas pressure on the thermal stability of the fiberswere determined through property comparisons between the pressure-treatedfibers and vacuum-treated fibers. Investigation of the thermal stabilityincluded studies of the fiber microstructure and mechanical and physicalproperties before and after treatments.</TEXT></DOC>
