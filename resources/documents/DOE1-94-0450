These plantsdiffer in their type of power generation: solar cell facility; solartower facility with thermal storage; paraboloid mirrors with Stirlingmachine; wind power plant. Each plant features the subsystems for (I)collection of solar and wind energy and conversion to electric power;(II) electrolytic hydrogen production; (III) feeds and bleeds for water,hydrogen and power including hydrogen storage. Annual hydrogen productionof each plant is 15x10/sup 9/ cbm/sub n//a (5.5 mil. t CU/a).</TEXT></DOC>
