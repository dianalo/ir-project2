They stared,sometimes they jeered, and once an angry coal miner attacked him.;    Stovicekwalked the streets of this smog-choked town wearing a red respirator. He wasan exotic, upright bird with a bright beak among a gray and bent populationused to conforming to the will of Communist dictators.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CZECHS GAINING COURAGE TO FACE AIR POLLUTION  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     More upsetting than Stovicek's appearance was the message the respiratorconveyed -- the air in the region was so bad that a young biology teacher in asmall town would risk public ridicule to protect his health.;    Now, peoplehave stopped staring and jeering.;    Now, on mornings when the smog growsthick, 23,000 well-scrubbed little faces head off to school masked by gauzerespirators.;    The district -- called Most -- is one of the most heavilypolluted regions in Europe. But until recently no one dared say a word aboutit.;    A year after Czechoslovakia's &quot;velvet revolution,&quot; people havedeveloped the courage to talk about the environmental disaster created by fourdecades of Communist rule and to try to do something about it. But the damagehere in northern Bohemia will take years to clean up.;    And the economy inCzechoslovakia is so perilously close to collapse that the government does notwant to shut down all the brown coal mines, the electric power plants or thechemical plants that belch filth and poisons into the environment.;    Themines produce about 70 million tons of brown coal a year -- about 70 percentof all the coal consumed in Czechoslovakia. And the region's half-dozen powerplants can generate 6,000 megawatts of electricity, which is nearly 60 percentof the country's electrical capacity.;    A chemical plant at Litvinov --which three months ago donated the 23,000 respirators to schoolchildren in thedistrict -- originally was opened by the Nazis to convert brown coal to motorfuel. Now it sits on the petroleum pipeline from the Soviet Union and makeskerosene, which is used primarily as jet fuel.;    People had becomeaccustomed to the thick smog, to the layers of coal dust, to the pungentsmells and to the sour taste of sulfuric acid in the backs of their throats.It simply was the price paid for having a job.;    Some of the damage isvisible in the forests and towns. Some -- in the lungs and bones of people --is less visible.;    The pollution has already killed 262 square miles offorest in the Krusne mountains bordering Germany. The communists destroyed 37villages to get at the coal deposits beneath them. They demolished the oldcity of Most, much of which dated from the 12th century, for a strip mine.;   The 500,000 residents of the region, which stretches from Chomutov in the westto Usti in the east, have a life expectancy of 67 years. That's two yearsfewer than the other 15 million Czechoslovaks, and four to eight years fewerthan other Europeans. Children lag a year or two behind children in otherregions in growth because they do not get enough vitamin D for bone growth.The smog blocks out the sun.;    These people also have Czechoslovakia'shighest rates of cancer, birth defects, premature births, miscarriages,bronchial illnesses and asthma. The children suffer from breathing problems.;   &quot;The illnesses are obviously linked with the high level of pollution,&quot; saidVaclav Mendl, head of pediatrics at the Most regional hospital for 11 years.;   The power and chemical plants fill the air with extremely highconcentrations of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide. There alsoare heavy concentrations of metals such as mercury, lead and arsenic in thedust from the mines and from the fly ash from the power plants.;    As aresult, 5 percent of the children in the region suffer from asthma. A large,but hard to pinpoint, number suffer from a variety of lung and bronchialproblems.;    About 8 percent of all births are premature, with 200 to 250children born each year weighing less than four pounds, and 20 to 30 weighingless than two pounds.;    One in 10 children born in the region has some sortof birth defect, 30 percent of which are serious, such as a heart or skulldeformity.;    In the cases of some severe birth defects, Mendl said he andhis staff had checked weather records and determined that the malformedchildren were conceived during weather inversions -- periods when the airpressure traps the pollution near the ground.;    &quot;But we never dared beforetell parents that their child was malformed because of the pollution,&quot; hesaid.;    Any doctor who was truthful about the environmental situation riskedlosing his job, Mendl said.;    Stovicek said he got the idea of therespirators five years ago while watching an athlete use one to train duringperiods of heavy pollution. Last December, a month after the Communistgovernment fell, he and a colleague began a campaign to see that all thechildren got them.;    He faced a series of skeptics and bureaucratic hurdles.The local public health officer, a communist, opposed the idea on the groundthat the respirators were useless.;    Stovicek found a company in nearbyKarlovy Vary that made a high-quality industrial respirator. He had it testedby an independent lab, which found it took 99.7 percent of the fly ash and 97percent of the harmful gases from the air. Then the chemical company agreed tobuy them for the children.;    The respirator is a simple device withoutmoving parts. It looks like a surgical mask and has a thick charcoal filtersandwiched between layers of felt.;    Stovicek sees two reasons to cheer nowthat the children have the breathing devices. The first is that therespirators provide some immediate, short-term relief until the region can becleaned up. The second is the impact the respirators are having on parents.;   &quot;When they see that their children are wearing respirators, they finallybegin to think about how bad things are,&quot; he said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAN STETS, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Mezibori, Czechoslovakia  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910101  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,014  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday January 1, 199100001139,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
