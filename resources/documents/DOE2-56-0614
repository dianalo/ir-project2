The goal has been to implement a load managementprogram at Gustavsberg VVS AB in order to reduce costs for power demand.Results from mapping and metering the consumption of electricity energyand power demand have been the basis for computerized simulation modellingfor load management scenarios. To all appearences, a load managementsystem at Gustavsbergs VVS AB would result in considerable economic savingstoday and in particular during 1989 when new electricity tariffs willbe introduced. Finally, in the light of these facts recommendations fora load management system are given.</TEXT></DOC>
