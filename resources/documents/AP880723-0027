About 1,000 supporters endured blazing heat to greet theDemocratic ticket on an airport tarmac here, adjacent to Bentsen'shometown of Mission. ``I don't want to kid you,'' Dukakis said.``This is going to be a tough race.''   A Mexican band played, and both Dukakis and Bentsen, perspiringin the July heat, addressed the crowd in both English and Spanish.Dukakis' command of Spanish helped him win Texas in the SuperTuesday primary.   ``You know how important Texas is going to be to us. And we needyour help,'' Dukakis told residents of the state also claimed ashome by the certain Republican nominee, George Bush. ``I know whatyou did on Super Tuesday for Michael Dukakis. You can do it again.''   Bentsen said ``What we have seen on the part of Michael Dukakisis a reaching out, a bringing in,'' of all segments of society.   The pair met briefly with reporters. Asked about Bush campaignmanager Lee Atwater's characterization of his acceptance speech asnegative and non-specific, Dukakis replied ``Well, he's an experton both subjects.''   Dukakis and Bentsen then headed to Houston for another rally,after which they traveled to California for the night.   Dukakis was greeted at the Stockton, Calif., airport by a largecrowd, some of whom said they had waited as long as two hours tocatch a glimpse of he Democratic nominee.   In Houston, Dukakis stood with Bentsen, their arms upraised, ata rally surrounded by the city's skyscrapers before a crowd ofabout 3,000 people.   ``The Republicans are confused,'' Dukakis said. ``They don'tknow what to make of this ticket. And they're worried, let me tellyou. Because they know we're not going to concede one single stateof the 50 to the Republican Party this fall.''   Bentsen was to accompany Dukakis throughout a five-state,coast-to-coast swing through the weekend.   Aboard their plane were several members of the Texascongressional delegation and Ann Richards, the state treasurer whodelivered the Democratic keynote address in Atlanta last Mondaynight.   Enroute to McAllen, Dukakis noted that the community is in theRio Grande Valley, an area suffering unemployment of ``25, 30, 35percent.''   ``We're going to make every American a shareholder in theAmerican dream _ that's what this campaign is all about,'' he said.   Earlier, former Democratic rival Jesse Jackson gave Dukakis andBentsen an enthusiastic sendoff from Atlanta before a crowd ofJackson's convention delegates. Jackson called on his supporters toprovide the ticket with the same ``street heat'' that led to civilrights gains in the 1960s. He said they needed to find millions ofnew voters for the November election.   ``We've got to keep on that street heat ... enough heat forGeorge Bush to get out of the kitchen,'' Jackson said.   ``The stakes are very high,'' Dukakis said before leavingAtlanta, where he accepted the Democratic nomination Thursdaynight. ``We can't take another four years of what we've been goingthrough for the last eight.''   The campaign stakes in Texas are the third highest in thecountry. It trails only California and New York in electoral voteswith 29 and Dukakis is counting on Bentsen to put those in theDemocratic column.   The senior senator's personal popularity in the Lone Star Stateis solid and his fund-raising ability unparalleled. He first wonthe Senate in 1970 by defeating then-Congressman Bush, and has beenre-elected twice since, netting 60 percent of the vote in 1982, andhe's staying on the ballot again this year.   Modesto, Calif., was the next stop after the Texas visit, wherethe ticket will be eyeing California's top prize of 41 electoralvotes. The swing back East will take them through Minot, N.D., andSt. Louis, Mo., and then a rally in Pennsylvania, fourth with 25votes in the electoral college.   Dukakis' aides said the trip was designed to demonstrate theirintent to battle in every state, conceding none to the Republicans.   Jackson and his audience gave a polite reception to Bentsen, themore conservative half of the ticket. Jackson acknowledged thatBentsen might be what the Democatic party ticket needed now.   ``He represents a wing. We represent a wing,'' he said. ``Ittakes two wings to fly.''   Jackson compared Bentsen with Lyndon Johnson, who was viewedwith skepticism by blacks but who ``rose to the occasion'' andbecame a force behind the civil rights legislation when he becamepresident. But Jackson also needled Bentsen, implying that peopleshould vote for him for president to get him out of the Senate.``In practical terms ... it means the Contras have lost a vote.''   Bentsen applauded Jackson's remarks and recited for the grouphis own record on civil rights. He asked for their support, saying``indifference is not an option in 1988,'' and at the end receiveda standing ovation.</TEXT></DOC>
