Albert Gore Jr. proposed the elimination of golden parachutes and performance bonuses unless they are provided to lower-level workers as well as executives.    Speaking at the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, the candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination made the proposal part of a pitch for &quot;democratic capitalism,&quot; an economic system that he said should include labor participation in corporate decision-making. &quot;Some of the best ideas come from people on the assembly line,&quot; Sen. Gore said in remarks to members of the exchange board and securities traders.    The Tennessee Democrat, struggling to gain a constituency for the New York primary a week from today, chose the symbolic center of American capitalism to make a stand for U.S. workers. Running as the underdog to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Sen. Gore has been trying to highlight an image of himself as the candidate for the middle-income and working classes.    Specifically, he called for the elimination of golden parachutes unless workers receive &quot;proportionate&quot; agreements. A golden parachute is the lucrative severance package, usually including pay and benefits, guaranteed to top executives in the event of a takeover or other major corporate restructuring.    Sen. Gore also proposed disallowing performance bonuses awarded only to top management. He said such bonuses, if permitted, should be given to employees throughout a corporation.    The senator's audience of market professionals seemed more impressed by his comments on the Oct. 19 stock-market crash and the economy generally than concerned by his ideas about executive remuneration.    The candidate criticized President Reagan for &quot;doing nothing&quot; when the market crashed. He said the U.S. needs the kind of president who would have moved immediately to restore confidence and who would be &quot;alert and responsive&quot; to any financial crisis.    Asked about raising taxes, Sen. Gore said he would consider such a move only as a &quot;last resort,&quot; and would prefer to reduce the deficit by cutting spending and making structural changes in government programs. But he said he would consider increasing income taxes on individuals earning more than $200,000 a year and on corporations. He also said he would look at some means testing for entitlement programs. Mr. Gore in the past has endorsed a &quot;luxury&quot; tax on expensive purchases.    Mr. Gore's proposals on behalf of working-class families are an effort to build on his record in Congress, including his years in the House. Particularly as a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, he challenged corporations on consumer, health and environmental issues. </TEXT></DOC>
