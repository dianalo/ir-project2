Nearly always, the victims and their killers are black.   Despite 350 years of black-white racial divisions, one of theironies of life in South Africa is that thousands of blacks dieeach year fighting other blacks, instead of apartheid.   At a time when President F.W. de Klerk is moving to endwhite-minority rule, black-against-black violence is spinning outof control, some analysts say. A culture of violence is becomingpart of South African life, they say, threatening hopes of buildinga peaceful, democratic society.   The independent South African Institute of Race Relationsestimates 4,000 people will die in black-against-black violencethis year. About 1,400 blacks died in factional fighting in 1989,according to the institute.   Victims are often hacked to death with knives or spears, themutilated bodies burned. Dozens have been killed by ``necklacing,''with gasoline-soaked tires placed around their necks and set afire.   Some leaders see the threat of a civil war, with South Africabecoming another Lebanon.   ``The appalling numbers of people who are dying, it isabsolutely shocking,'' anti-apartheid leader Rev. Allan Boesak saidin an interview with The Associated Press. ``That is the kind ofsituation that can lead to the Lebanization of South Africa.''   Some black leaders worry that the growing rivalry among warringblack factions is the prelude to a struggle for power once whiterule ends. Itumeleng Mosala, president of the Azanian People'sOrganization, foresees increasing violence between blacks ifapartheid ends.   ``It's going to continue because violence has a way of repeatingitself,'' he says. ``So, I would say that we are going to see asituation of near civil war in this country.''   White supporters of apartheid cite black violence when defendingwhite-minority rule. They claim black-majority rule would signal amassive bloodbath.   White settlers in Kenya and Rhodesia, before it became Zimbabwe,used the same argument in opposing the approach of black rule inthose countries. But while rival black groups struggled briefly forpower after independence, there was little killing and whites werenot singled out for revenge.   Kenya and Zimbabwe, however, did not experience the massiveblack-on-black violence now sweeping South Africa.   The causes of black violence in South Africa are many andcomplex. Reasons include apartheid, poverty, anti-governmentstruggle, school boycotts, political and ideological rivalry, thecollapse of authority, gangs and corruption.   The bloodshed is compounded by old tribal and clan rivalriesstretching back over generations.   In the squalid black townships, violence has become a daily partof life for the millions of blacks forced to compete desperatelyfor survival, say Boesak and others. Caught by hopeless poverty andapartheid laws, violence is one of the few ways for blacks to venttheir anger, they say.   ``One would have to say that the basic problem here isapartheid, that it has created circumstances in which violencebecame not only the norm, but the almost natural action andreaction,'' Boesak says.   In the early 1980s, the African National Congress, the mainblack opposition group, called for a program of destabilization tomake the country ``ungovernable'' and undermine the whitegovernment. Young blacks became the spearhead, demonstrating,attacking police and boycotting schools.   Local administration and control was undermined in many blacktownships. Blacks seen as government ``collaborators,'' includingblack township councilors and black police, were frequentlyattacked and killed.   But often the anti-government ``struggle'' is little more thanmob violence by youth gangs, says Mohammed Valli Moosa, ananti-apartheid leader. In some black townships there is nowvirtually no authority and rival groups try to wrest control.   Some black leaders concede these tactics helped create a ``lostgeneration,'' young blacks raised in poverty with virtually noeducation and a burning hatred for authority _ black and white.   ``Many of these youths missed out on education and areunemployed and unemployable,'' says political analyst David Breier.``They are the generation of `no education before liberation.'''   But the lawlessness has spread to almost every level, involvingbusinesses, workers and schoolchildren. A recent ``war'' betweenrival taxi companies in a Johannesburg township left more than 20dead.   Criminal gangs have exploited the unrest, sparking wars withradical young blacks. Groups of vigilantes, some linked to police,have warred with rival ``comrades'' from the ANC and otherpolitical groups.   Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader recently released from prison,and others have attempted to halt the violence by appealing toyouths to return to school. But the appeals have been spurned bymany who reject negotiation with the government.   ``The problem is that many of the youngsters are not reallyinterested in negotiation. In fact, they have become a little bitangry,'' said senior ANC leader Walter Sisulu.   The violence has been exacerbated by increasingly bitterdisputes between rival black political groups. While all areopposed to apartheid, various factions are competing for supportwith conflicting visions for South Africa's future.   In Natal Province, some 5,000 blacks have been killed in recentyears in vicious fighting between the conservative Inkathapolitical movement and allies of the ANC. The struggle pits atraditional group with strong tribal roots against urban forcesseeking a modern, ethnically integrated society, analysts say.   The ANC favors confrontational methods such as its guerrillacampaign, sanctions and boycotts, and rejects black homelandgovernments as part of the apartheid system. Inkatha supports thehomeland system, saying blacks must run their own affairs as aninterim step on the road to black majority rule.   The struggle has tribal overtones, with Inkatha relying ontraditional Zulu followers while the ANC-allied United DemocraticFront combines urbanized Zulus and other tribes, analysts say.   The ANC, regarded as the largest and most powerful black group,also faces strong opposition from more militant organizations suchas the Pan African Congress and groups linked to the BlackConsciousness Movement.   The PAC broke away from the ANC because of its multiracialfoundation. The PAC is an ``Africanist'' group that campaigns forAfricans to control all aspects of life and rejects Westerninfluences.   ``Political tolerance is, sadly, not a strong feature of ourcountry,'' says Alf Stadler, a political science professor at theUniversity of the Witwatersrand in South Africa's gold-mining andindustrial region.</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
