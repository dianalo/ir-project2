Gen. Prosper Avril.   It was the second mutiny within the 7,000-man army since Sunday,when Avril narrowly escaped an attempt to overthrow his 6-month-oldgovernment. But diplomatic sources, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said Avril remained in control.   Under the state of emergency, an immediate curfew was put intoeffect in Port-au-Prince and its suburbs between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m.   No gunfire was heard, and there was no indication ofinsurrection within the ranks of the navy, air force, police orrural army commands.   ``Our impresssion is that it is not an attempted coup,'' butrather an internal army dispute, said one Western diplomat.   ``It's a standoff,'' another diplomat said. ``I think they'rejust staring each other down,'' he said, referring to the rebelsand loyalist troops.   A government communique said the state of emergency wasnecessary because ``certain politicians in Haiti and abroad aretrying in every way to divide the armed forces of Haiti and incitedisorder and violence.''   Rumors have been circulating widely that the week's rebellionwas organized and funded by former henchmen of the ousted Duvalierdictatorship exiled in the neighboring Dominican Republic.   Avril's Presidential Guard stationed two anti-aircraft guns,four armored personnel carriers and three wheeled cannons insidethe compound of the National Palace.   Across the Champ-de-Mars Plaza, about 300 supporters gatheredoutside the Dessalines Barracks, where the rebellion broke out.Smoldering barricades temporarily blocked nearby streets.   Radio reports said rebels seized control of several buildings,including the telecommunications company, the state-run centralbank, the Ministry of Education and the State Bureau of Statistics.   Shops in downtown Port-au-Prince closed early. Pedestrians andmotorists fled, leaving the capital's normally congested streetsnearly deserted at midday.   Workers abandoned Haiti's international airport, forcingairlines to cancel flights, which had resumed Tuesday for the firsttime since the abortive coup.   A statement by Army General Headquarters read over state-runtelevision Wednesday afternoon ordered all soldiers to reportimmediately to their command posts.   The government also issued a statement declaring a state ofemergency and telling television, radio and newspapers they couldonly disseminate information ``authorized and signed by themilitary government.''   Local radio stations appeared to be ignoring the order,continuing regular newscasts. The government made no immediateeffort to interfere with foreign news organizations.   The government order was issued after dissident soldiers fromthe feared Dessalines army unit went on the radio to demand Avril'souster, blaming the Haitian leader for the deaths of four rebelsoldiers.   Their announcement over independent Radio Metropole createdconfusion in the capital, which had been returning to normal afterthe deportation of those accused of leading the uprising over theweekend.   Three noncommissioned officers and a captain from the DessalinesBarracks, the most repressive unit in the army, appeared at RadioMetropole to issue the statement. ``Avril is responsible for thedeaths of the Leopards. He must go,'' said an unidentified soldier.   He was referring to the killing of four mutinous soldiers fromthe Leopards Battallion during a skirmish Monday with soldiers ofthe Presidential Guard.   The protest came one day after Avril deported the Leopard'scommander, Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, 38, and two other officersidentified by the government as leaders of the coup attempt, Col.Philippe Biamby, 36, and Col. Leonce Qualo, 35. He also reportedlyfired six high-ranking officers.   The three deported officers arrived in Miami with their familiesWednesday and applied for asylum, U.S. immigration officials said.They were being held temporarily at immigration facilities inMiami, the officials said.   The Leopards, a crack, 400-man commando unit, had ended theirrevolt Tuesday after their commander was deported. But RadioAntilles, an independent station, quoted soldiers within the unitas saying Wednesday they were prepared to join the Dessalinesrebels.   It was not immediately known how many soldiers from the 700-manDessalines Barracks were involved in the protest.   Wednesday afternoon, about 50 soldiers met reporters at thebarracks to clarify their demands, according to radio reports. Theydemanded that Avril resign and hand over power to the president ofthe Supreme Court of Appeals and that the government fully restorethe suspended 1987 constitution. Avril has partially restored theconstitution as part of his program of democratic reform.   The rebels also demanded equal pay and rights afforded membersof Avril's 1,000-man Presidential Guard and legal protectionagainst arbritrary dismissals.   Several officers have been discharged or transferred in acrackdown by Avril on corruption and drug-trafficking within thearmy. The United States has made the drug crackdown a condition forthe resumption of $70 million in annual U.S. aid that was suspendedafter thugs killed 34 voters in November 1987, thwarting thecountry's first free elections in more than three decades.   Until Wednesday, the Dessalines soldiers had maintained aneutral position in the aftermath of Sunday's attempt to overthrowAvril's 6-month-old government.   Avril, 50, was brought to power last Sept. 11 by noncommissionedofficers who wanted to end state-sponsored violence and ousted Lt.Gen. Henri Namphy. Namphy took power in 1986 when dictatorJean-Claude Duvalier fled to France, ending a 29-year dynasty.</TEXT></DOC>
