(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>No Big Demand Found for Data Encryption At VAX Sites, Despite DEC's OfferingsandM;While data security threats have piqued interest in data encryption at manymainframe and microcomputer sites, there's been no such scramble in the DECmarket.andM;Although DEC introduced its first data encryption products for Ethernet lastyear and followed up early this year with other products, the marketplace hasbeen slow to react.andM;DEC and the handful of third-party makers of DEC-market encryption productshave attracted few customers.andP;  Whether it's because VAX sites are poorlyrepresented in the industries that have been quick to embrace data encryptionor because DEC itself took a decidely low-key approach when it announced itsdata encryption system, the market remains essentially untapped.andM;&quot;In general, the minicomputer market is little penetrated,&quot; said Larry Dietz,a project manager for Frost andamp; Sullivan, a New York market research company.andM;Dietz pointed out that financial institutions--generally recognized as thelargest segment of the data encryption business--typically run mainframesystems.andP;  Chemical, drug and toy manufacturers, all of which employ dataencryption to protect trade secrets, also tend to use mainframes or microsmore than minis.andM;Banking, manufacturing and financial/insurance companies combined account for62 percent of all sites in the United States that use data encryption,according to Computer Intelligence, a La Jolla, Calif., market researchcompany.andM;Only a fraction of U.S.andP;  Fortune 1000 and non-Fortune sites have installedcomputer security systems.andP;  Computer Intelligence estimates that only 17percent of all Fortune 1000 sites and only 10 percent of non-Fortune sitesuse computer security systems.andM;Two ApproachesandM;The computer industry generally employs two approaches to network security:data encryption and callback systems.andP;  Data encryption encodes data withmathematical algorithms that prevent unauthorized access to the system, aswell as line tapping.andM;Callback systems seem to have grown in popularity in recent months, ascompanies have become more conscious of the potential damage from hackers andcomputer viruses.andP;  Data encryption, on the other hand, offers no protectionagainst viruses--and experts note that once a virus enters a system it can beencrypted and travel throughout the network with authorized data.andM;&quot;The impact of any encryption systems on viruses is minimal,&quot; said a seniorexecutive at one company who asked not to be named.andP;  &quot;If the virus takes aride with a piece of E-mail...the virus will be decrypted and ready to go.&quot;andO;The executive said data encryption will thwart viruses when communication islimited to certain system users.andM;While the publicity generated by computer break-ins appears to have raisedthe visibility of all security products, it has not spurred strong sales ofdata encryption systems.andM;&quot;The DEC market is incredibly soft,&quot; said Michael Schwartz, president ofPrime Factors of Eugene, Ore., makers of Descrypt Plus, a $2,000 softwarepackage and one of the few data encryption suppliers in the VAX market.andP;  &quot;Thetendency in the corporate world is to use VAXes, but not to put sensitiveinformation on them--at least not for long,&quot; he said.andM;DEC announced the first version of its Digital Ethernet Secure NetworkController (DESNC) hardware and Key Distribution Controller (KDC) softwarelast April, and its customers &quot;are starting to wake up&quot; to the need toencrypt their data, said Bill Gassman, DEC's product manager for the system.andM;DESNC encrypts and decrypts network data and manages certain securityfunctions.andP;  Groups of DESNCs can act together on a LAN to enforce networkaccess control policy, according to DEC officials.andP;  KDC software managesseveral DESNCs on an Ethernet LAN or extended LAN, the officials said.andP;  KDCtakes care of key distribution when a node initiates message transmissionsand transmits the keys, or passwords that allow users to read encrypted data,in encrypted packets, DEC officials said.andP;  (See &quot;Products Team Up for LANSecurity,&quot; Digital Review, June 6, 1988, page 93.)andM;Each DESNC is priced at $8,000.andP;  The KDC software ranges from $300 to $9,975.andM;Gassman conceded that DEC hasn't exactly trumpeted the launch of DESNC andKDC, but added that the company is &quot;starting to get repeat business from ourcustomers.&quot;andP;  Universities where students and administrators often share thesame system, have become a prime market for DEC's data encryption product.andM;&quot;DEC never did a public announcement on the product,&quot; said Larry Kilgallen,an independent software consultant who specializes in security.andP;  &quot;I waswalking past their booth at ISSA in San Francisco and it was just sitting ona table with some black and white brochures.&quot;andM;Kilgallen said he sympathizes with DEC executives who face a difficultdilemma: Promoting data encryption can be interpreted as a knock on theworthiness of the computer system as a whole.andM;&quot;In a sense, it's kicking the previous product,&quot; Kilgallen said.andP;  &quot;I don'tthink that's valid, because everyone knows that Ethernet was not a verysecure environment.andP;  People should know that they shouldn't have been runningit outside their computer room.&quot;andM;Although analysts and even DEC officials concede that any security system canbe broken into, given enough time, money and manpower, the aim of DESNC andother data encryption products is to create so many obstacles that the effortbecomes prohibitively expensive.andM;DEC's data encryption products, as well as its competitors' products, arebased on the Data Encryption Standard (DES) defined by the National Bureau ofStandards.andM;DES is said to be the dominant single-key encryption algorithm, and it is theonly one endorsed by the U.S.andP;  government.andP;  It includes a set of functionsthat transforms one 64-bit input into a 64-bit output, which generates morethan 70 quadrillion possible transformations enabled by a 56-bit key.andM;The algorithm is used for both data encryption and data authentication--andsome industry experts said that its use for authentication is criticallyimportant for financial institutions--which use data encryption forelectronic funds transfer (EFT) and electronic data interchange (EDI).andP;  DEShas been used for data storage, electronic mail, EFT and EDI, among otherapplications.andM;&quot;If today's user has any one of the major accepted [encryption packages],&quot;Dietz said, &quot;they can be reasonably certain their communication is secure.&quot;andM;Some detractors point out, however, that the Enigma cipher machine used bythe Germans during World War II had about 200 quintillion keys--and wascracked by a team of British scientists without the aid of so much as apocket calculator.andM;But DEC-based systems have improved on the process by changing the keys onencrypted data at regular intervals, and most experts say the current systemsoffer a practical level of invulnerability.andM;&quot;Sure you may be able to break it,&quot; said Prime Factors' Schwartz, &quot;But ifwhat you spend to do it is more than the [potential] gain, you don't have avery good deal, do you?&quot;andP;  Schwartz said that a computer system trying one keyevery microsecond, would take more than 1,100 years to crack a DES-based dataencryption system.andM;Prime Factors' Descrypt Plus, DEC's DESNC and KDC and other data encryptionproducts appear to follow the same basic structure: All data is encryptedthrough a DES algorithm and can only be decrypted by a computer-generated keythat matches the encryption key.andM;Central to Descrypt Plus is a security management component: security filesthat are composed of random information used to construct a DES key.andP;  &quot;It iscompletely random according to all mathematical tests for randomness,&quot; PrimeFactors' Schwartz said.andP;  The security file then becomes the first record inthe encrypted data file.andM;DEC has taken a hardware/software approach to data encryption, though actualdata encryption is also based on DES.andP;  &quot;In Ethernet terms, [DESNC] looks likea bridge to the network,&quot; DEC's Gassman said of the plug-in hardware thatwill accept as many as 20 devices.andM;&quot;If data is addressed from one node to another, that data will not appear onthe main cable,&quot; Gassman said.andP;  The system manager has access through afront-panel keypad and uses the interface to initialize the system.andO;Information can be encrypted from terminal to terminal throughout the entirenetwork.andP;  The DESNC software, which is VMS-based, then generates the firstencryption key.andM;The Key Distribution Controller &quot;instructs&quot; the DESNC as to which nodes cantalk to each other and for how long, Gassman said.andP;  Encryption/decryptionkey's are actually assigned by the system for a limited time--though thatcould mean anything from four hours to four years--and users are warned whenkeys are about to expire.andP;  The keys also have a half-life and are changedautomatically at that point.andM;&quot;One or both [users] have to call the security manager and say you want [yourterminals] to talk to each other,&quot; Gassman said, noting that the systemmanager normally can assume the role of security manager.andP;  If a third partyeven attempts to break in, the system notifies the security manager.andM;There is a trade-off in system performance with DESNC, as it reduces Ethernetperformance, Gassman said.andP;  Version 1 of DESNC was said to reduce Ethernetperformance from the typical 10Mbits per second (Mbps) to about 4.5Mbps,though Gassman said version 2 improves on that rate.andM;DEC Approach CriticizedandM;Not surprisingly, competitors have taken shots at DEC for using what they sayis a more complicated--and more expensive--approach.andP;  &quot;No one likes to addhardware,&quot; said Prime Factors' Schwartz.andP;  &quot;If you can sell something thatdoesn't require a board and works just as well, people will stay away fromthe board.&quot;andM;But unless sales pick up, Schwartz is taking a wait-and-see attitude aboutfuture introductions.andP;  And if other third-party vendors take the same stance,that could cede the market to DEC by default.andM;Although DEC has made no official announcement, the company reportedly hasalso reached an agreement with RSA Technology of Redwood City, Calif., thedeveloper of the Rivest-Shamir-Adelman (RSA) standard, for what some industryexperts see as a plug to a hole in DESNC: an absence of public keys toidentify individual nodes.andM;&quot;RSA is the pre-eminent public key,&quot; consultant Kilgallen said.andP;  &quot;Thecombination of RSA for node identification and DES for encrypting messages iswhat most informed people believe is needed for the commercial sector in thiscountry.andP;  The combination of DES and RSA is a very important event.&quot;andM;Kilgallen said that node identification represents a &quot;desparate need&quot; in theDEC world.andP;  If and when DEC introduces a package that combines DES and RSA,it will be able to address end-to-end encryption over DECnet in addition toEthernet encryption, he said.andM;&quot;There's been a recognized need for end-to-end encryption for DECnet,&quot;Kilgallen said.andP;  There are smart people in DEC who understand the largerissues.andP;  I hope this is the beginning of DEC doing larger things.&quot;andM;Kilgallen pointed out, for example, that in a three-city DECnet--running fromBoston to Chicago to Los Angeles--DESNC might protect data transmittedbetween Boston and Chicago or Chicago and Los Angeles.andP;  But data travelingbetween Los Angeles and Boston through Chicago might be vulnerable if someonebased in the Windy City attempted to break in, he said.andM;&quot;You want a break in security in Chicago to affect only information destinedfor Chicago,&quot; he said.andM;Whether DEC and third-party vendors opt to offer additional data encryptionproducts depends largely on how the market-place reacts to current offerings.andM;According to vendors, there are few technological barriers preventing othersuppliers from developing their own products.andM;&quot;Anyone can write a DES alrogirthm and it will work,&quot; Prime Factors' Schwartzsaid.andP;  &quot;There are some special tricks to make it run faster.andP;  [And] you wantto automate as much as you can and in such a way that it has minimal impacton users.andP;  You're working toward transparency.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
