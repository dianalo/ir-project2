These six hazardous substances have been tested for toxicity,by the NTP, under prechronic conditions and are being considered for placementon a list for possible long-term testing. With this notice, ATSDR solicitspublic comments on the six hazardous substances listed herein.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE AND ADDRESS: </T2>Written comments bearing docket control numberATSDR-12 should be submitted by January 11, 1990 to: Dr. Barry L. Johnson,Assistant Administrator, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry,and Chairman, Hazardous Waste Information Evaluation Subcommittee, 1600Clifton Road, NE., E-28, Atlanta, Georgia 30333. (404) 639-0700.All written comments on this notice will be available for public inspectionat ATSDR, Building 37, Executive Park Drive, NE., Atlanta, Georgia, from8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Section 104(i)(5)(A) of the ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended(CERCLA or Superfund) (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.), requires ATSDR to conducthealth assessments of sites on or proposed for inclusion on, the NationalPriorities List established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).ATSDR's health assessments involve the evaluation of environmental contaminationand of toxicological, demographic, and human health data in order to characterizepublic health implications of individual hazardous waste sites. Where gapsin toxicological information exist, ATSDR sponsors studies at the NTP toaddress the gaps. ATSDR seeks advice and recommendations from HWIES onwhich hazardous substances should be studied and the types of studies tobe performed by NTP. Hazardous substances are nominated to HWIES by agencieswith statutory responsibilities under CERCLA. Each substance is reviewedby HWIES and recommendations are provided to ATSDR concerning the needfor toxicological testing.Nominated hazardous substances are published with request for commentsin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> to encourage public participation in the HWIESevaluation process. Through this process, HWIES can make better informeddecisions whether to select, defer, or reject hazardous substances fortoxicology study. Comments and secondary data submitted in response tothis request are reviewed and summarized by HWIES and forwarded to ATSDRand NTP for further evaluation. On July 11, 1989, HWIES evaluated six chemicals nominated by EPA for toxicologystudies.
