WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Mondayemerged as the sole contender for leadership of his ChristianDemocratic Union as the governing party heads into the 1990 nationalelection campaign.   The party's support, tendered in a closed-door meeting, is amuch-needed boost for the chancellor, who has suffered a drop inpopularity among voters.   But the apparent decision to retain Kohl as party leader andtherefore its candidate for chancellor next year could disappointthe majority of West German voters who want a change from the statusquo.   A public opinion poll released over the weekend by the respectedEmnid research firm indicated 71 percent of West German votersquestioned want an alternative to Kohl as chancellor, including 59percent of the respondents claiming allegiance to Kohl's party.   Political observers had speculated that more popular members ofthe party might come forward to challenge Kohl as the party headsinto a tough re-election fight.   Kohl declined to talk with reporters after the three-hourmeeting, but a participant, Rhineland-Palatinate governorCarl-Ludwig Wagner, said Kohl emerged as the sole candidate forparty leadership.   The party will hold its national convention in Bremen in lessthan two weeks, at which another chancellor candidate could emerge.But Monday's decision appeared to indicate the party will stick withKohl.   The Christian Democratic Union has been damaged by controversiessuch as U.S. accusations that West German firms helped Libya build achemical weapons plant, and Bonn's refusal to endorse a NATO plan toextend the range of nuclear missiles based in West Germany.   Amid those crises, the party suffered some serious electionsetbacks this year, losing control of important cities like Berlinand Frankfurt.   Kohl and his party recovered some voter confidence this summerfollowing the May 29-30 NATO summit, at which the missile debate wasresolved, and the high-profile visit by President Bush immediatelyafter.   But the Emnid poll, commissioned by the weekly news magazine DerSpiegel, indicated further damage has been caused by a dispute overKohl's firing of long-time party manager Heiner Geissler.   Geissler has had a moderating influence on the party in recentyears, moving it toward the ideological center as the West Germanelectorate became more concerned with social security issues and theenvironment.   The poll of 1,000 voters showed 38 percent support the ChristianDemocratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian SocialUnion, and an equal 38 percent favor the left-leaning SocialDemocratic Party.   With neither of the two main political parties polling amajority, a coalition with one of the smaller parties would benecessary to win control of the federal government in the 1990balloting.</TEXT></DOC>
