It said among the injured were National Guard commander Col. JoseHumberto Gomez, who received a shrapnel wound in a leg, and sevencivilians.   A broadcast by the rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos said theassault was a ``welcome'' to officers recently promoted in changesin the armed forces, including the new chief of staff Col. ReneEmilio Ponce. Ponce assumed his command Tuesday.   Col. Jose Galileo Torres told The Associated Press that rebelmortar fire set off grenades stored inside the main building in thecompound during the 45-minute attack. Firefighters were able toextinguish the blaze, he said.   The rebels also parked two cars loaded with explosives about ablock from the guard compound in nothern San Salvador and one blewup, a Defense Ministry spokesman said. Army munitions expertsdeactivated explosives in the second vehicle, the spokesman said,speaking on condition of anonymity.   He said eight of the wounded guardsmen were in critical conditon.   No rebel casualties were reported.   The National Guard is part of El Salvador's armed forces andtakes part in counterinsurgency operations.   Ponce said the attack was carried out by commandos of theFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the umbrella group offive leftist guerrilla organizations.   Ponce, speaking at the guard headquarters, told reporters thatabout 15 rebels took part in the attack, which he said was stagedfor its ``propagandistic'' value.   The explosions panicked residents of the working-class districtsurrounding the headquarters. Witnesses said the car explosiondamaged three buses, two other cars and two homes.   Col. Leopoldo Hernandez, the deputy public security minister,said rebel mortar fire destroyed two guard barracks in the compound.   Hernandez said the surprise attack ``doesn't mean there wasneglect by the security forces or the National Guard. What happenedis, there isn't any way to stop a mortar attack.''   Hernandez said security forces were sweeping the area for rebels.   National Guard officers interviewed at the site said theybelieved the 81 mm mortars were launched from an area known as LaLomita, a hillock with some houses on it about 530 yards east of thecompound.   The rebels previously attacked the National Guard headquarters inJanuary 1981, during their so-called ``Final Offensive'' against theU.S.-backed government.   In March 1985, rebels attacked the National Police headquartersin the capital, wounding four police officers and three civilians.   Military sources in Sensuntepeque, 50 miles northeast of SanSalvador, said earlier that rebels attacked the prison there forfour hours Monday night, but no injuries or escapes resulted.   The rebel violence appeared to have no relation to the seizure oftwo guards and a nurse by inmates at a prison in Quezaltepeque, 15miles north of San Salvador, the capital.   Six inmates there demanded political asylum in Mexico in exchangefor the hostages' release, a prison official said. But he said thesix are in prison for homicide or assault and ``have no reason tomake political demands.''   Julio Cesar Valdivieso, director of prisons, was negotiating withthe inmates, his assistant director, Victor Amaya Fuentes, said.   Col. Miguel Vasconcelos, commander of the army brigade that hassurrounded the prison, said the hostage-taking incident began Mondaynight when three prisoners jumped two guards and took their rifles.   ``Three other prisoners have joined the rebellion and they aredemanding political asylum in Mexico,'' Amaya Fuentes said.   The six convicts controlled part of the prison Tuesday. The other242 inmates remained in their cells.   ``There are negotiations, but they don't want to give up and they(threaten to) shoot the first one who comes near them,'' a guardsaid. ``They are willing to do anything.''   Soldiers with faces painted black surrounded the prison.</TEXT></DOC>
