If ratified by the 20,500 USW members on the job at the nation'ssecond-largest steelmaker, the agreement would be the first amongfour major producers whose contracts expire July 31.   The 50-month agreement would immediately boost the averagehourly wage from $11.23 to $12.22, restoring an 8 percent cutgranted by the union in August 1982.   It also restores three paid holidays and cost of living bonuses.It improves pensions and insurance benefits and awards each workera $500 signing bonus and a $500 advance on this year'sprofit-sharing payments.   The offer goes next to the union's international executive boardand then to a vote by the rank-and-file. The negotiating committeevoted 18-7 in favor.   Bethlehem's major plants are at Sparrows Point, Md., Bethlehem,Pa., and Burns Harbor, Ind.   ``This is an agreement that puts the past behind us and ... allthe difficult times of the 1980s,'' said USW President LynnWilliams.   ``The settlement recognizes that sacrifices were made by USWAmembers in the past two contracts and also that Bethlehem is stilla company in transition that must continue to carefully control itscosts,'' said Bethlehem Senior Vice President Curtis Barnette, alsothe company's chief negotiator.   Bethlehem lost more than $2 billion from 1982 to 1986. Last yearit had profits of $403 million, and in the first quarter this year$65 million.   The workers are expected to approve the contract because of themoney it offers, but Williams said the centerpiece of the agreementis a career development program.   Bethlehem will pay $300,000 per month for worker training,education and personal development.   The program will also receive the $5 per hour Bethlehem agreedto pay for each hour of overtime worked beyond 56 hours per week.The penalty climbs to $7.50 per hour in 1991 and $10 per hour in1992.   The penalty reflects the union's distaste for heavy overtimeduty for some of its members while others have faded intoretirement, lower-paying jobs or unemployment due to the industry'smassive cutbacks since 1982.   Williams said the career development program address the union'sdesire to help workers enhance their skills and with them their jobsecurity.   ``We've been itching to get at the problem in a more substantialway,'' Williams said. ``We've created an opportunity to make a moresubstantial contribution to our members.''</TEXT></DOC>
