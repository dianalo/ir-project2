The hodgepodge of events reflects the character of the $21billion State, Justice, and Commerce Departmentappropriations measure for fiscal 1992, which limped out ofthe chamber yesterday only after budgets had been scuttledfor not only the endowment but also the Economic DevelopmentAdministration and the Legal Services Corp.</LP><TEXT>   The endowment's setback reflected pressure from MajorityWhip William Gray, who has been infuriated with the Bushadministration's handling of a $10 million specialappropriation he won for anti-apartheid political parties andorganizations in South Africa. The endowment is intended tochannel U.S. money to fledgling democratic movements abroad,but in this case, Mr. Gray argued, the grants have beenunreasonably delayed and their impact diluted by the proposeddistribution of funds to American consultants.   &quot;I don't think we need to teach democracy,&quot; said thePhiladelphia Democrat. &quot;People are fighting for it, dying forit, whether in South Africa or Poland.&quot;   Under a budget proposed by the administration during thewinter, for example, little more than one-third of the totalis designated for the African National Congress, andapproximately $2.6 million would go to such groups as theCarnegie Endowment and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rightsunder Law, or be held in reserve and for administration.   As initially approved by Congress last year, the money wasto go as directly as possible to the anti-apartheid movement,but the National Endowment for Democracy's role has beencomplicated by the fact that the appropriation moves firstthrough the State Department and the Agency for InternationalDevelopment. Conservatives in Congress have been leery of anysupport to the ANC, and the endowment, which has enjoyedbipartisan support in recent years, finds itself torn bythese divisions.   In a House fight last month, the agency beat back aneffort to cut its fiscal 1992 spending authorization, but inthe weeks since Mr. Gray has solidified his support in theDemocratic leadership. &quot;He has this concern and I think hewas justified,&quot; said Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D.,Mo.), and faced with these defections, allies of the agencymoved to strip its entire $26 million budget rather than losepublicly and suffer the $10 million cut proposed by Mr. Gray.   Though most attention and money is directed to the Stateand Justice Departments, the underlying bill provides almost$2.5 billion for the Commerce Department, including $1.42billion for the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration. More than $60 million would be cut from theadministration's budget for NOAA's weather satellite program,already plagued with huge cost overruns, but tens of millionsof dollars are added back elsewhere to preserve research andfisheries projects often of parochial interest to lawmakers.   Among these are $542,000 for a Arkansas fish-farminglaboratory and $394,000 to continue grants to the MarineResources Development Foundation in Key Largo, Fla. Bothitems are sponsored by Rep. Bill Alexander (D., Ark.), asenior member of an appropriations subcommittee, and weresubject to a Republican-backed challenge that failed on a267-151 roll-call vote.   Mr. Alexander has a long interest in undersea research,but Florida corporate records and his annual disclosure formsshow that his support of the Key Largo project has beenaccompanied by a separate business venture with the managersof the non-profit marine foundation. In an interviewyesterday, the congressman said he invested $20,000 in 1986,and records show he received shares in a Florida corporationwhose officers direct and receive pay now from thefoundation. After initially rising, the value of thisinvestment has diminished greatly, according to Mr.Alexander's disclosure forms, but he remains a shareholder intwo related corporations that operate a small underwaterhotel and have sought to develop a park in a lagoon sharedwith the foundation.   The NOAA program, funded though annual appropriations,appears to date first to the fiscal 1988 Commerce bill, whichpassed a year after Mr. Alexander's investment. The projecthas won praise since for its work in instructing high schoolteachers and college students in marine wildlife andoceanography, but Mr. Alexander must regularly protect thefunds from cuts by the administration.   &quot;It's my project,&quot; said Mr. Alexander, but he and themanaging director of the foundation, Neil Monney, denied anyconflict. &quot;If there was, I wouldn't be getting money for thefoundation,&quot; said Mr. Alexander, who also said his friendshipwith the foundation director, Ian Koblick, runs back to thelate-1970s.   &quot;They are my partners,&quot; said the Arkansas congressman,&quot;but I have no involvement&quot; in the research foundation.</TEXT></DOC>
