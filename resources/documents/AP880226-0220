But to create jobs in the hard-hitregion, they take different routes. This, the last story in afour-part series looking at rural poverty, details the candidates'proposals, from training and basic education to rural enterprisezones and increased wages and farm prices.</TEXT><BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Most of the presidential candidates agree thatnew jobs are the key to combating poverty, especially in the ruralSouth, but their proposals for creating them differ widely, fromminimum wage revisions to education, enterprise zones and savingthe family farm.   Responding to a survey by The Associated Press on how to dealwith rural poverty, Democrats Jesse Jackson and Gary Hart bothpushed an increase in the $3.35-an-hour minimum wage, whileRepublican Pat Robertson said there should be a subminimum ``youthopportunity wage'' to help teen-agers break into the job market.   The Republicans, in general, stressed economic development. VicePresident George Bush said rural America ``has been strongly testedin recent years,'' but is ``headed back up.''   Bush's chief rival, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas,said that as a disabled war veteran, ``I am sensitive to the needsof people who, due to factors beyond their control, may need aboost in climbing the ladder of opportunity.''   Dole said he would change the formula for funding povertyprograms that he said ``discriminate against rural America.''   Both Bush and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York suggest ruralenterprise zones. Robertson said education is ``the turnkey'' toresolve poverty in the South.   Among the Democrats, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, who ishoping to score heavily in his home region during the Super Tuesdayprimaries March 8, said, ``Our greatest defense against poverty iseducation.''   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri said his ``trade, agriculturaland competitiveness initiatives ... will restore economic health torural America.''   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis said every distressed area inAmerica, urban or rural, could benefit from the same developmentand welfare reform policies that have worked in his state,including job training for welfare recipients and public-privatedevelopment partnerships.   Jackson said, ``The cornerstone of anti-poverty policy is fullemployment at adequate wages.'' He called for a national floor onwelfare payments, universal national health care and a commitmentto save the family farm.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., said day care was vital for the ruralpoor. He said his public works program would give people a betteropportunity than welfare or unemployment benefits, and he pledgedto ``bring farm prices back up.''   The Associated Press asked all the presidential candidates onFeb. 11 to respond to the following question:   ``The Census Bureau reports that in 1986, when the nationalpoverty rate was 13.6 percent, the poverty rate in the South was16.1 percent. More than 13 million or 40 percent, of the nation's32 million poor people live in the South. As President, how wouldyou deal with poverty in general and rural poverty in particular?''</TEXT><TEXT>   Here is how the Democrats replied:</TEXT><HEAD>MICHAEL DUKAKIS</HEAD><TEXT>   ``In Massachusetts, we have made `Opportunity for All' afundamental economic goal. We have reduced unemployment from nearly12 percent in 1975 to three percent today. ... Our ET (Educationand Training) Choices program has helped more than 40,000Massachusetts residents lift themselves from public assistance toreal jobs. And the Massachusetts Housing Partnership has helpedprovide decent and affordable housing for 30,000 families of lowand moderate income, with thousands more in the pipeline.   ``America can and must do the same. Through a strong nationalurban policy and a parallel commitment to regional development, wecan bring to every distressed area and to every region, rural orurban, the opportunity to combine public investment with privateresources and create new jobs.   ``Through national welfare reform, we can make the success of ETa nationwide success. And with a National Partnership forAffordable Housing _ one that combines a renewed federal commitmentwith the sensitivity of local initiative _ we can end the nationaldisgrace of homelessness and provide affordable housing for workingpeople, the poor and the elderly.''</TEXT><HEAD>RICHARD GEPHARDT</HEAD><TEXT>   The Missouri congressman said welfare benefits should be highenough to bring poor families up to the poverty line. Welfareprograms must be reformed to give people ``the skills andexperience they need to leave welfare and poverty behind,'' andprovide preschool education for their children at age 3.   Gephardt supports ``higher Medicare prepayment rates for ruralhospitals'' and federal efforts to strengthen ``both ourinfrastructure and our transportation system in rural areas.''   To spur rural development, Gephardt ``will utilize the expertiseof local governments, rural electric and telephone cooperatives,Cooperative Extension (through land grant universities), and theprivate sector to help communities build their own economicdevelopment strategies. ... The FmHA Business and IndustrialDevelopment Loan Guarantee Program, which has languished in recentyears, will be aggressively reorganized and expanded.''</TEXT><HEAD>ALBERT GORE JR.</HEAD><TEXT>   ``The key to winning the war against poverty is giving allAmericans the first-rate education that will guarantee them a job.... Job training and retraining programs, like formal education,are also vital to preventing poverty. ...   ``I believe there is a great deal we can do to revitalize therural economy so that fewer families are forced to live in poverty.First, we must improve and maintain our ability to compete for jobsand markets. We need to improve rural infrastructures to attractnew jobs. We must make it easier for new enterprises to get startedand for small businesses to stay in business. We need strongpresidential leadership to open markets abroad and help workers andfarm families earn a decent income at home. Above all, we need anagricultural policy that works.''</TEXT><HEAD>GARY HART</HEAD><TEXT>   Jay Angoff, a Hart campaign aide in Washington, said the formerColorado senator favors a comprehensive strategy ``of promotingbetter health care in rural areas, higher quality education, moreand better paying jobs, a better infrastructure and a greateravailability of transportation and other services.''   Among the anti-poverty strategies Hart has proposed: raising theminimum wage to $5 an hour; voluntary national service, including aliteracy corps; universal access to pre-school education, andincentives for student teachers to teach in rural areas.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
