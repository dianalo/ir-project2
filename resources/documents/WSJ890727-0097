In the past year and a half, IBM has bought pieces of nearly a dozen companies, stepping up the pace in recent months. The computer giant is mainly trying to buy technology or expertise in certain areas such as software for insurance companies in the case of its Policy Management stake. IBM also seems to be trying to buy software developers' loyalty in the increasingly competitive industry.    Together with recent moves to increase its ability to install and even operate computer systems for customers, the investment strategy means IBM is forging ahead with its plans to turn itself into a software and services company that happens to make its own computer hardware.    An IBM spokesman says IBM doesn't have any targets for the number of investments it will make. &quot;We're trying to pick and choose,&quot; he says. &quot;It's not like we want to do one a month.&quot; But he said there will probably be more.    Consultants and industry executives say they expect many more. They say, though, that the investments will follow the scattershot approach of recent months, because, under IBM's new decentralized management structure, the investment decisions are being made primarily by the numerous independent business units.    Like many big companies, IBM doesn't have the greatest record with investments, acquisitions and joint ventures. In the early 1980s, IBM gave up on a joint venture with MCA Inc. that reportedly spent $100 million on the videodisk business. A major venture with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. was disbanded three years ago. Another venture, Satellite Business Systems, failed to go anywhere, and when IBM traded its holding for a stake in MCI Communications Corp., that didn't produce any synergies, either. More recently, IBM has been unwinding its purchase of Rolm Corp.    In addition, IBM's size can smother small companies. Some have said that IBM employees visiting them can at times outnumber their own employees. Interleaf Inc., which has a marketing arrangement with IBM, said earlier this year that its IBM product had been a money loser and that IBM needed to market it harder.    &quot;I see a lot of activity but I don't see a lot of leadership in this area,&quot; says Fred Gibbons, chairman of Software Publishing Corp., which has held talks with IBM on various possible relationships.    Still, IBM seems to have learned from some of its earlier mistakes. It seems to have patched up its differences with Interleaf, for instance, and companies that IBM has bought into say the giant has gone to great lengths to shield them from its formidable bureaucracy.    &quot;What impressed me is that we dealt with one person through the whole process,&quot; says David Sarna, chief executive of Image Business Systems Corp., an image-processing software company that recently sold a stake to IBM. &quot;And within general guidelines, he seemed to have complete authority to act,&quot; Mr. Sarna adds.    He says that IBM executives &quot;are feeling their way, just like we are.&quot; But he says they moved surprisingly fast, completing the agreement in 10 weeks. He also says that while IBM, under a previous marketing arrangement, paid its salesmen only for the IBM equipment they sold, it agreed to pay commissions on sales of Image Business Systems software, too.    &quot;If you say IBM is buying loyalty, that's a true statement,&quot; Mr. Sarna says. &quot;But it works both ways.&quot;    IBM is so big and has so many people arranging so many deals that there is still plenty of room for confusion. Doug Kahn, chief executive of Interactive Images Inc., a maker of software-development tools, says a glitch developed the day before he was to sign his agreement with IBM. He says IBM had an overlapping arrangement with another software company, and that the two companies got conflicting information from inside IBM. Mr. Kahn says several executives from his company got on a conference call with executives from IBM and the other company at 4 p.m. and didn't finish until 3:30 a.m. Some of Interactive Images' vice presidents then stuck around to type up changes to the contract, and Mr. Kahn didn't see the final contract until he arrived at an IBM office later that morning to sign it.    Mr. Kahn says he has a full-time person keeping track of what goes on inside IBM. &quot;There are many, many different organizations inside IBM that have different agendas, and we have to make sure that we stay visible inside IBM,&quot; he says. Still, he says he's been impressed with IBM's ability to move fast and shield him from its complexity.    While IBM's investments have been all over the lot-in fiber-optic technology, data-retrieval systems, computer networks and so on -- the Policy Management investment illustrates IBM's considerable interest in developing expertise in various industries. Sam Albert, a consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y., says IBM once sold its own software for the insurance market, but that it was rendered obsolete, so this is a way for IBM to renew its commitment to the area.    The Policy Management investment also shows IBM's willingness to make bigger investments than it has made in this recent wave. The dollar value is greater than that of any other investment that IBM has disclosed. The size of the holding -- preferred stock convertible into a 19.8% stake, plus the right to buy a further 10.2% in the open market -- is also one of the largest that IBM has bought.    Besides all the software investments, IBM has been active on other fronts as it pursues its aim of generating more than 50% of its revenue from software and services by the early 1990s. IBM has been emphasizing systems integration, a fast-growing field in which consultants set up whole computer systems for customers and often write the software used on them. As part of that, IBM has bought stakes in two companies -- Computer Task Group Inc. and American Management Systems Inc.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, IBM shares closed at $112.50, down 25 cents. In national over-the-counter trading, Policy Management shares rose 50 cents to close at $31.50. </TEXT></DOC>
