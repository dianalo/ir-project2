Hutton andamp; Co.'s office here.    The firm's agreement to be bought by Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. is expected to result in layoffs of about a third of Hutton's 18,000-member staff world-wide. But the investment bank's London capital-markets arm appears one of the hardest-hit areas so far.    Hutton is laying off about 80% -- or 190 people -- of its London-based U.K. capital-markets staff, according to sources familiar with the firm's plans. Letters went out to affected staffers early last week; about half of those were expected to leave before today. The other half may remain until sometime in the first quarter.    A Hutton spokesman in New York confirmed that the firm began informing its staff world-wide about layoffs last week. But he said he couldn't provide a breakdown of the scale of the layoffs until the process is completed, likely in early 1988.    The Hutton cutbacks rank as the biggest single securities-industry reduction in Britain since a wave of layoffs began this summer. In recent months, securities houses in the City, London's financial district, have laid off a total of more than 650 staffers. And a source familiar with Hutton's plans said that while the London capital-markets cutbacks appear severe in percentage terms, they may emerge as roughly similar to eventual cutbacks throughout Hutton's capital-markets operations.    Layoffs have loomed in Hutton's London capital-markets operations since the firm agreed to be acquired earlier this month by Shearson, a unit of American Express Co., New York. Of the 240-person staff, only 50 will be asked to join Shearson when the takeover is completed next year, according to the sources. About 25 people remaining are oil and foreign-exchange dealers and salesmen; the rest are operations staff and a handful of Eurobond traders. The future of Hutton's 110-person retail staff in the U.K., as well as more than 200 retail employees in continental Europe and the Mideast, won't be decided until the new year, the sources said.    Separately, A.J. Bekhor andamp; Co., a London brokerage house, said it plans to lay off 29 traders and salespeople, or roughly 9% of its staff, because of a downturn in volume since the October stock market crash. </TEXT></DOC>
