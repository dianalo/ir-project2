Itis shown that their main activation mechanisms: 1. through non Watson-Crick-typepoint mutation, 2. through activation by LTR binding to the end of anoncogene and 3. through transposition of an oncogene to another chromosomeneed an external agent. The principal mechanisms of short- and long-rangeeffects of chemical carcinogens are reviewed. A possible very effectivemechanism for long-range effects of chemical carcinogenesis through generationof conformational solitons in DNA are discussed in detail.</TEXT></DOC>
