The measurements were carried out on FeBO/sub3/ sample having the form of thin, rectangular plate, which plane coinsidedwith that of weak magnetization. It is experimentally stated that inunloaded FeBO/sub 3/ samples at NMR frequency bound nuclear-acousticvibrations may be excited, that is manifested in efficient increase ofthe sound relaxation time determined by parametric magnetoacoustic echo.</TEXT></DOC>
