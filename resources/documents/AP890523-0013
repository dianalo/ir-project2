Energy Secretary James D. Watkins filed an affidavit with theU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here Monday supporting the NuclearRegulatory Commission's plan to issue a low-power operating licenseto Seabrook, the subject of intense battles between pro- andanti-nuclear forces for more than a decade.   ``New England urgently needs the power that Seabrook is ready toprovide, and there are no satisfactory near-term alternativesources of supply,'' said the retired Navy admiral in entering thelatest battle in the 20-year war over Seabrook. ``Any unnecessarydelay in bringing this plant on-line would be, quite simply, badenergy policy and flatly inconsistent with the public interest.''   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, Attorney General JamesShannon and other Seabrook opponents are asking the court for anemergency order blocking the license until a full appeal can beheard.   Last week, the NRC said the license could be issued Thursdayafternoon in the absence of a court order. It was not known whenthe court would rule.   Seabrook critics say the coastal area around the southern NewHampshire reactor cannot be evacuated quickly. They also chargethat Public Service Company of New Hampshire, the plant's principalowner, is financially unsound to run the plant. Public Servicefiled for federal bankruptcy protection last year.   Watkins, in his seven-page affidavit, did not address safety andfinancial concerns but instead stressed regional power needs andnational energy security.   Without Seabrook, the region could fall below the 20 percentsurplus energy standard later this year, even if it experiencesonly moderate growth in demand, Watkins warned.   ``During the past year, in fact, New England suffered repeated`brownouts' and rolling `blackouts,' and similar emergencyprocedures will probably again become necessary as soon as thissummer,'' the energy secretary said.   Watkins has taken an unusually high profile in arguing for boththe Seabrook plant and the Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island.   ``An unreliable electricity supply system can inhibit regionaleconomic growth and diminish the quality of life of our citizens,''Watkins said. ``For New England, the danger of falling below thepoint where adequate electric service can be assured is both realand immediate.''   Watkins said Seabrook, already a decade behind schedule, couldreceive its full-power commercial license by Sept. 30.   Opponents, however, say regulatory and court challenges will putoff a final decision on commercial operation for years. The fightover the low-power license has taken three years.   Watkins said there is no ``economically sound alternative'' toSeabrook. Coal-fired plants are strongly opposed byenvironmentalists and would take at least five years to build, hesaid. New natural gas pipelines could not be ready until themid-1990s and conservation efforts cannot keep up with the region'srapid economic growth, Watkins added.</TEXT></DOC>
