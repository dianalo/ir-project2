Augusto Pinochet seized power in 1973. Theopposition is expected to win.   Of 7.5 million registered voters, 3.5 million have never votedin a real election. Voting is mandatory and failure to vote canbring a $95 fine.   Most pre-election polls gave Patricio Aylwin, who represents analliance of 17 centrist and leftist parties, a lead of more than 20percentage points over pro-government candidate Hernan Buchi.   A third candidate, 47-year-old conservative entrepreneurFrancisco Errazuriz, is expected to finish far back.   The opposition alliance led the effort that defeated Pinochet inan October 1988 referendum by rejecting a proposal that he continueas president until 1997. That forced him to call elections.   Although he will be out as president, Pinochet says he willremain as army commander for eight more years, sheltered by aconstitutional provision that prohibits the new president fromdismissing him. The opposition has urged him to retire, butacknowledges it is the general's decision.   A violent coup led by Pinochet in September 1973 overthrew the3-year-old elected government of the late President SalvadorAllende, an avowed Marxist, during a period of political andeconomic disorder.   Interior Minister Carlos Caceres told foreign reporters theelection was ``the culmination of a orderly, staged process'' thatstarted the day of the coup. He said the military government ``hadkept its word'' to restore democracy once it established order,rightened the economy and created a new legal framework forgovernment.   Upon taking power, Pinochet had promised to rule ``only as longas circumstances demand.''   In preparation for the Thursday's vote, municipal workersstripped campaign posters from walls and telephone poles, andpainted out political graffiti that blossomed in a generallypeaceful campaign. Campaigning ended Monday night by law.   Soldiers and police guarded polling places, along with strategicsites in the cities and countryside.   Pinochet made no public statements, but Gen. Jorge Lucar, thedeputy army commander, asked Chileans to ``go and vote peacefully,knowing they can count on all guarantees necessary to cast theirballots freely and secretly.''   Aylwin's campaign manager, Enrique Silva Cimma, met Wednesdaywith Gen. Carlos Parera, commander of the Santiago garrison, andsaid Parera gave assurances the armed forces would guarantee aclean vote.   Another coalition official, Enrique Krauss, asked the governmentto report voting results ``in strict accordance with the law.''   In the 1988 referendum, widespread allegations arose thatnegative results were held back for hours before the governmentadmitted Pinochet had lost.   Caceres said initial results would be reported after the first350,000 votes, about 5 percent of the total, were counted Thursdaynight and updated reports would follow every 90 minutes or so.   Caceres said final results for the 38 Senate seats and the 120in the House of Deputies would be known about noon Friday.   Cardinal Juan Francisco Fresno of Santiago said Wednesday: ``Ibelieve we can now say in all truth that spirits have calmed and wecan be confident of a new dawn in peace and fraternal friendship.''   The church was one of Pinochet's few outspoken critics duringyears of anti-leftist repression that followed the coup. Itcondemned violations of human rights, including the disappearancesof hundreds of dissidents and the torture and expulsion ofthousands more.   Aylwin, 71, is a moderate Christian Democrat, active in politicsfor four decades and known for a low-key, conciliatory style. Hehas stressed the need to avoid confrontation and seek nationalreconciliation.   Buchi, 40, is an internationally respected technocrat who joinedPinochet's economic team in 1975 and was finance minister from 1985until May, a period of steady economic growth and low inflation.His advisers hope to keep Aylwin's vote total below a majority inthe three-way race and force a runoff.</TEXT></DOC>
