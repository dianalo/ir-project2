Fifteen countries in the South Pacific Forum demanded in Julythat Japan and Taiwan entirely ban fishing with the enormous nets,calling it ``indiscriminate, irresponsible and destructive.''   Japan said then it would continue to permit driftnet fishing fortwo years while researching its effect on fish stocks, whichfisheries experts in the region said could be depleted within twoyears. Taiwan has not responded to the demands to end driftnetfishing in the South Pacific.   Today, Japan's Foreign Ministry said the Fishery Agency notifiedSouthern Pacific countries including Australia, New Zealand and Fijithat Japan is to reduce the number of driftnet vessels in the seasonstarting in November to a maximum of 20 per year, the level beforethe number shot up to about 60 driftnetters.   Fishing with driftnets, which are also called gillnets, isstrongly disputed in the North Pacific as well.   The United States has negotiated with Japan, South Korea andTaiwan to limit and monitor use of the long nets whichenvironmentalists call ``walls of death'' because they snare allkinds of marine life.   Driftnet fishing uses nets up to 50 miles long. It has beencondemned as strip mining of the seas and blamed for the destructionof sea mammals, birds and fish other than the target, southernalbacore tuna.   The United States has complained that driftnet fishing inunauthorized North Pacific waters was hurting salmon runs in Alaska,Washington state and Oregon.   During the 1988-89 fishing year, the 60 Japanese driftnet vesselsin the South Pacific caught some 10,000 tons of tuna, said a ForeignMinistry official who spoke on condition of anonymity.   In comparison, Australia caught just 200 to 400 tons bypole-and-line fishing, New Zealand 5,200 tons by trawling, and theUnited States fetched 3,700 tons, the official added.   Kentaro Iwasa, spokesman for an association of pole-and-line tunafishers, said the government's decision should be a step towardeliminating driftnet fishing.   ``Some of our fishing boats got into trouble when the boat'spropeller got caught in a driftnet where driftnet fishing wasprohibited,'' he said, ``We've been urging driftnet fishers and thegovernment that hazardous driftnet fishing should be eliminated.''   Foreign Ministry Spokesman Taizo Watanabe told reporters thateach driftnet vessel will have to report its catch.   Japan will send a patrol vessel to police Japanese driftnettersand a research vessel to the Tasman Sea, between Australia and NewZealand, for biological research, he said. One representative fromthe region can participate in the research team as an observer.</TEXT></DOC>
