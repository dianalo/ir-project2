Walid Khaled, spokesman for Abu Nidal's Fatah-RevolutionaryCouncil, said Monday that the girls, Marie-Laure Betille, 7, and hersister Virginie, 6, were on their way to Paris by plane. But theynever arrived in the French capital.   In west Beirut today an official of the organization said:``Comrade Walid Khaled revealed the latest information on the twoFrench girls yesterday. There is nothing new on them.   ``Comrade Walid Khaled is not in town and cannot be reached,''said the official, who identified himself only as Izzat.   Khaled said Dec. 24 that the girls would be released within 24hours in response to a call by Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi,the group's main financial backer.   On Sunday, Khaled said the girls were to be released ``outsideLebanon,'' but refused to say where.   On Tuesday, he announced that Abu Nidal had met the girls at oneof the faction's bases in Lebanon, said goodbye to them and approvedarrangements to send them home. He refused to say when the meetingtook place.   The girls were seized by Abu Nidal's gunmen aboard a yacht offthe Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip in November 1987. Also seized werefive Belgians and the girls' mother, Jacqueline Valente, who isseparated from their father, Pascal Betille.   An informed Palestinian source, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said Khaled was ``intentionally making conflictingstatements about the girls to divert attention from the reallocation where they will be set free.   ``I wouldn't be surprised if they surface in an Arab capital inNorth Africa,'' the source said. He refused to elaborate.   Algeria said in January it was prepared to host the releaseoperation.   Khaled said when the Europeans were seized that they were spyingfor Israel. But Israeli press reports said the yacht was hijackedwhile sailing off the Libyan coast.   Lebanese security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,believe that the captives have been held in Libya all the time.   Ms. Valente, who was pregnant when the yacht was seized, gavebirth to a baby girl in captivity early this year. She has beenreported pregnant, apparently by one of the Belgian men heldcaptive, and to be expecting another baby early next year.   Fifteen other foreigners are being held hostage in Lebanon,including nine Americans. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was abductedMarch 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
