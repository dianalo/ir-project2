On a 50-25 vote Friday night, the Senate attached to the taxbill an amendment by Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., that would seize540 acres of land on which the Second Battle of Manassas was foughtin 1862. The aim of the provision _ which the House already hasapproved _ would be to block development of a shopping mall on theland.   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel has said he would recommendthat President Reagan veto any legislation to which the amendmentwas attached.   ``You are asking the Senate to follow you in a Pickett's chargeto the president's veto pen,'' Sen. John Warner, R-Va., toldBumpers.   But without his amendment Bumpers said, the promontory whereConfederate Gen. Robert E. Lee had his headquarters during thebattle will be paved over. ``And I can see a big granite statue inthat mall (with the inscription): `General Lee stood on thisspot,''' Bumpers said.   In siding with Bumpers, the Senate turned down a substitute planby Warner, which would have allowed the federal government to take80 acres of the privately owned land and allow housing constructionon adjacent areas.   Debate over the Manassas amendments and several other non-taxproposals delayed final action on the bill, whose main purpose isto correct errors and clear up confusion arising from the big 1986tax overhaul. The Senate Finance Committee already has attached tothe measure dozens of special tax benefits worth about $2.76billion plus the assorted tax increases necessary to pay for them.   The package includes a ``bill of rights'' for taxpayers involvedin disputes with the Internal Revenue Service. The bill relievesfarmers from the federal tax on diesel used for off-road purposesand from the ``heifer tax'' on livestock-production expenses.   Other beneficiaries include free-lance artists, corporateinvestments in research, first-time homebuyers, contributors tocollege athletic funds, and workers who receive employer-financedlegal or education aid.   The Senate has agreed to a final vote on the bill Tuesday night,but only after considering another two dozen amendments.Congressional leaders hope negotiators can then work out acompromise between the Senate bill and the $7.5 billion versionalready approved by the House.   The tax bill is one of two major measures standing in the way ofadjourning the 100th Congress; the other contains tools to fightdrug abuse. For that reason, senators know that if they have anyhope of getting a pet project approved in the closing days of thesession, it will have to be tacked onto the tax bill.   At nightfall Friday, more than 100 amendments were waiting to beconsidered, and Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., was notpleased. ``This list is crazy, nuts and getting crazier all thetime,'' Byrd said. ``We ought to settle down and get our senses.''   Within two hours, Byrd announced senators had agreed to drop allbut 29.   ``This is the typical tax bill,'' said Republican Leader BobDole of Kansas. ``Everybody cleans out their desks and their trashcans and says `we'll put it on the tax bill.' We've reached thepoint that if somebody doesn't take the bull by the horns, we'llnever finish.''   The Senate rejected amendments calling for:</TEXT><TEXT>   _An end to what Sen.
