L. 100-360), which mandates that: ``the Secretary shallestablish, by not later than January 1, 1991, a point-of-sale electronicsystem for use by carriers and participating pharmacies in the submissionof information respecting covered outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicarebeneficiaries under this part.'' (Related provisions of the Social SecurityAct are at sections 1842(b)(3)(J) and (K), 1842(c)(1)(A)(ii), 1842(f)(3),1842(h)(1), and the remainder of Section 1842(o). This system of recordswill contain beneficiary-specific information on Medicare prescriptiondrug benefit entitlement, deductible status, and, over time, prescriptiondrug use. HCFA will thus be able to properly and expeditiously pay Medicarebenefits to or on behalf of the beneficiary in question and to inform thebeneficiary at the point of sale of her/his deductible status and of potentialprescription drug interaction problems. Under all conditions, sensitivedata will be safeguarded from disclosure and protected from unauthorizedmodification or destruction. Each user will be required to present a validpassword before being allowed access to the system. Only those personswhose duties require access to beneficiaries' records will be given passwords.Authorized pharmacy personnel will have only limited read/write accessto beneficiaries' records. Beneficiary-specific prescription Drug informationwill be available to authorized personnel of enrolled pharmacies only ininstances of potential outpatient prescription drug interactions, and theinformation available will be limited to the prescription drug(s) implicated.The Privacy Act permits us to disclose information without the consentof the individual for ``routine uses''_that is, disclosure for purposesthat are compatible with the purpose for which we collect the information.We anticipate that disclosure under the routine uses will not result inany unwarranted adverse effects on personal privacy.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Louis B.
