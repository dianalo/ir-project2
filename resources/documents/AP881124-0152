If adopted, the pact would mean higher prices forgasoline and other petroleum products.   Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh of Iran said he would return toTehran on Friday to consult with his government before accepting theplan. He said he might return to the OPEC meeting on Sunday.   The arrangement, he said, would set total OPEC production at 18.5million barrels a day for the first six months of 1989. It wouldmaintain the cartel's benchmark price of $18 a barrel.   Recent production increases have driven oil prices well belowthat mark.   Cartel members often have ignored their quotas and analysts saycurrent production has well exceeded 20 million barrels a day.   Each dollar increase in the price of crude oil theoreticallymeans a rise of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices.   A minister involved in the discussions with Iran, asked if theplan could be modified, replied, ``Not from our point of view.'' Hespoke on condition of anonymity.   Venezuelan Oil Minister Julio Cesar Gil said, ``It's a fluidsituation. It depends. ... Mr. Aghazadeh (is going) to Tehran forconsultations.''   The tentative plan, worked out by the 13-nation Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, was put forth to break a deadlockbetween Iran and Iraq over a new output accord.   Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister, has beeninsisting that Iraq's production ceiling in any new pact be the sameas Iran's. Aghazadeh had said no.   It was unclear exactly how that dispute was resolved.   Asked if was still refusing to allow Iraq to have the same quotaas Iran, Aghazadeh replied, ``This is exactly the issue which I haveto consult with my government.''   Aghazadeh, who spoke to reporters after a late evening meetingwith other ministers, said Iran would retain its share of totalcartel output at 14.27 percent.   ``I received a new proposal,'' he said, ``in which my mainconcern, which is to preserve my percentage share, is taken intoconsideration.''   A ceiling of 18.5 million barrels would give Iran a quota of 2.64million barrels a day. It currently has a ceiling of 2.4 millionbarrels.   Iraq's quota in the current accord is 1.5 million barrels a day.Iran has been allowed more to serve its larger domestic oil market.   Aghazadeh said the other 11 members have agreed to give part oftheir share to Iraq in an effort to break the deadlock.   The plan must be approved by all 13 OPEC ministers.   Formal negotiations among the OPEC ministers had broken offshortly after the winter meeting began here Monday.   The ministers had been scheduled to return to the bargainingtable on Wednesday but postponed their formal meeting untilThursday, then put it off until Friday.   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's oil chief, andOil Ministers Sadek Boussena of Algeria, Ginandjar Kartasasmita ofIndonesia and Gil of Venezuela met with Aghazadeh for about an hourThursday.   Asked earlier Thursday whether officials had delivered anultimatum to Iran, Ginandjar replied, ``We don't work on that basis.We never give an ultimatum to anybody. Everything should be done onconsensus.''   The apparent inability of the ministers to break the Iran-Iraqdeadlock had raised the possibility that they might adjourn theirtalks this week and try again in December or January.   If the ministers fail to reach a production agreement this week,analysts have said prices could weaken further.   The January contract price for West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark U.S. crude, closed Wednesday on the New York MercantileExchange at $13.97 a barrel. The markets were closed Thursday in theUnited States for the Thanksgiving holiday.   The current ceiling for 12 members _ Iraq refused to join _ isabout 15 million barrels a day.   The cartel has been exceeding that sum, with production estimatedat more than 21 million barrels a day.   The ministers want to include Iraq in any new output accord.   Some of the OPEC ministers arrived in Vienna more than a week agoto try to stop the feuding between Iran and Iraq. The bitter rivalsagreed to a cease-fire in August in their 8-year-old war.</TEXT></DOC>
