A high-volatile bituminous coal was pulverized to a massmean of near 50 {mu}m. The coal was gasified with oxygen in a laboratory-scaleentrained-flow gasifier. No steam was used. Test pressures were 1, 5and 10 atm (10,500, 100 kPa). Oxygen-to-coal mass ratios between 0.60(SR0.30) and 1.10 (SR0.56) were investigated. Gas-particulate sampleswere collected with a water-quenched probe from the gasifier chambereffluent stream. Measurements were made of the sulphur in the char particlesand of the levels of H{sub 2}S, SO{sub 2}, COS, and CS{sub 2} in theproduct gas. Increasing pressure yielded a significant decrease (about25%) in net conversion of coal sulphur. This decrease was shown by anincrease in the sulphur content of the char samples, and by a decreasein total sulphur concentration in the gas phase. Gas species measurementsshowed that increased pressure yielded lower SO{sub 2} and CS{sub 2}concentration, but did not significantly affect H{sub 2}S and COS concentrations.It was concluded that increased pressure shifted the distribution ofsulphur among the gas phase species, yielding higher H{sub 2}S and lowerSO{sub 2} and CS{sub 2} concentrations. The increase in H{sub 2}S wasnot seen in the measurements, because increased pressure also tendedto increase the capture of H{sub 2}S by char. Increasing oxygen-to-coalmass ratio increased sulphur conversion and SO{sub 2} and COS levels,while it decreased H{sub 2}S and CS{sub 2} levels. 22 refs., 4 figs.,4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
