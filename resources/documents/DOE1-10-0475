<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-10-0475 </DOCNO><TEXT>It is shown that the general features of the heavy ion elastic scatteringdata are reproduced by using a smooth cut-off model for the scatteringmatrix in which the real nuclear phase shift and the reflection coefficientare used as analytic functions and have a few adjustable parameters.A computer program is described for carrying out the calculations tofit the experimental ratio of elastic differential cross-sections toRutherford cross-sections. The scattering of 10.375 MeV/u/sup 12/C ionsfrom Fe, Ag and Ta are considered as test cases. The absorption radiiand reaction cross-section predicted by the theory are also calculated.</TEXT></DOC>
