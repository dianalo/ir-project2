Under the proposal, individual East German wages andsavings of as much as 4,000 marks ($2,373) would be changedinto West German marks at a favorable one-to-one rate.Pensions also would be swapped on that basis, giving retireesmore spending power than they now have.</LP><TEXT>   The offer -- still only an opening position for the comingnegotiations -- is a major concession to the East Germangovernment, which argued that East German workers need to becushioned during their bumpy transition to a market economy.   As the two nations hurtle toward economic and monetaryunion, now set for as early as this July, Bonn is underpressure to offer a favorable package to the East. EastGermany heavily subsidizes everything from housing togroceries, and many East Germans fear they would become thepermanent underclass in a united Germany unless something isdone to put more money in their pockets.   Meanwhile, West Germans have begun to balk at shoulderingthe bulk of the costs of unity. Many in the West, includingofficials of the powerful Bundesbank, or central bank, say agenerous exchange rate would fuel inflation and raiseinterest rates.   As a compromise, the West Germans are proposing exchangingsavings above 4,000 marks at a less-favorable two-to-onerate. Debts held by individual East Germans and businessesalso would be exchanged at the lower rate.   Beyond this, the plan leaves plenty of room fornegotiation. For example, while calling for one-to-one parityin wages, the plan says nothing about how wage rates wouldactually be set. Many workers could still see their relativewages fall as managers introduce free-market mechanisms andnegotiate new union contracts.   As if to underscore such uncertainties, East GermanFinance Minister Walter Romberg yesterday predicted that atleast 20% of the East's crumbling factories could go out ofbusiness once the two economies integrated. An additional 50%would need financial help to survive, he said, while only 30%would be fit to compete on their own. Against thisbackground, West German officials say they had little choicebut to offer generous terms.   East Germans continue to flow into the West, albeit moreslowly than earlier this year. Unless West Germany can offera package that reassures East Germans that they aren't betteroff moving to the West, this exodus could continue.   &quot;We feel this proposal is a good offer for the beginning,&quot;says one top aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Theaide adds that the West German leader has stayed in closecontact with his East German counterpart, Prime MinisterLothar de Maiziere, and that Bonn &quot;got signals&quot; that EastBerlin was ready to strike a compromise on these sensitiveissues. Only after such basic questions are clarified can thetwo countries grapple with the complex details involved infull monetary union.   The East Germans wasted no time in responding to theoffer. Mr. de Maiziere will be in Bonn today to discuss theplan with Mr. Kohl and expert-level negotiations might beginwithin a week. An East German government spokesman dubbed theplan &quot;an acceptable basis for negotiations.&quot; But WolfgangUllman, vice president of the East German parliament,criticized the one-to-one limit on exchanging savings.   &quot;If this is the final decision,&quot; he said, &quot;there should besharp protest, because a large part of savings won't beconsidered here.&quot;   The West German plan is supposed to do two things, calmthe fears of East Germans and remain manageable for thepowerful West German economy. West German Finance MinisterTheo Waigel, speaking to his European Community counterpartsin Luxembourg yesterday, said the proposal wouldn't boostWest German inflation. He said increased East German savings,prompted by introduction of market interest rates, wouldoffset inflationary pressure created by the injection of WestGerman marks into the East.   Sources at the Bundesbank, however, made it clear thatthey remain dubious supporters of the plan. &quot;It's agovernment decision, and it is they who in the end must carrythe responsibility,&quot; said a Bundesbank official. &quot;Anyway, itis our impression that this is merely a proposal that mustfirst be negotiated with the DDR {East Germany}.&quot;   Most East Germans have less than 4,000 marks in their bankaccounts, one reason this figure was chosen as a cutoffpoint. But the people with huge savings accounts are oftenformer entrepreneurs who were forced to sell their businessesto the state during the years of communist dictatorship.These are the same people who now would be most likely toinvest in new businesses.   Groups representing East German entrepreneurs already havecalled for exemptions from the exchange limits to allowpeople to use their savings to build up new ventures. Butworking out such exemptions will be difficult, consideringthe pressure to move quickly.   The West German plan leaves many of the most complexproblems untouched. It says nothing, for instance, about theintroduction of a West German-style taxation system or otherdetails on economic and monetary union.   The most generous aspect of the proposal is its treatmentof pensions. Retirees in East Germany get about 450 marks amonth, about one-third of their West German counterparts. Aone-to-one exchange would doom East German retirees topoverty.   So the West Germans recommended that the East adopt apension system styled on their own, with pensions pegged to70% of the average net income over 45 years of employment.The result, in many cases, will be hefty pension increases.</TEXT></DOC>
