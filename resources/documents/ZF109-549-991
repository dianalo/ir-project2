(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The supercomputer, despite its high political and high technology profile, isgiving way to a new set of distributed technologies built around workstationsas the chief means of technical computing in the 1990s.andM;The implications of this shift, which began in the late 1980s and acceleratedthroughout 1990, are enormous for users and suppliers alike.andP;  For users, theavailability of supercomputing power at desktop system prices means fargreater access to such power for scientists, engineers and other technicalusers.andM;For vendors, the change from hostbased supercomputing to a distributed modelthreatens current market leaders and gives hope and opportunity to others.andO;Dataquest Inc., a San jose, Calif.based market research firm, estimatesworldwide demand for technical-computing systems will grow a vigorous 14% peryear from $22.6 billion in 1989 to $43.5 billion in 1994.andM;The full impact of this change in technical computing won't, of course, beknown for some time.andP;  What is known today is information about thetechnologies, products and suppliers available to users in search ofeconomical solutions to the technical challenges they face.andM;For our purposes, these alternative supercomputing machines will be known assupersubstitutes,&quot; and will include minisupercomputers, graphicssupercomputers (or superworkstations) and specialized parallel computers.andO;Workstations, superminicomputers and mainframes can be considered lessoptimal supersubstitutes.andP;  Benchmarking Super PerformanceandM;Cost-effective FLOPS-that is, the power to process large amounts of floatingpoint operations per second-come in many new forms.andP;  Machines as varied as aworkstation from Sun Microsystems Inc. or a special purpose computer fromThinking Machines Corp. all do the same computation as a supercomputer-forless than 5 to 50% of the price.andP;  Evidence of this capability abounds.andM;Take the 1989 results of the PERFECT benchmark, for example.andP;  PerformanceEvaluation for Cost-Effective Transformation, a suite of tests developed atthe University of Illinois's Center for Supercomputing Research andDevelopment in Urbana, attempts to measure supercomputer performance andcost-effectiveness.andM;In the 1989 trials, an eightprocessor Cray Y-MP/832 supercomputer took thelaurels for peak performance by achieving 22 million floating pointoperations per second for unoptimized baseline  programs and 12OMFLOPS forhand-tuned, highly optimized programs.andP;  In contrast, a singleprocessorStardent 3000 superworkstation performed at 4.2MFLOPS with no tuning.andO;Slower, but 27 times more costeffective than the untuned Cray Y-mp programs,considering the price difference.andP;  The Y-mP sells for  18.8 million, whilethe Stardent lists for $123,000.andM;The PERFECT results typify the inverse relationship between size of computerand computing power evident throughout the worldwide computer industry asdesktop systems  Pcs, workstations, etc.) are compared with host models(mainframes, minicomputers, etc.).andP;  When it comes to getting high-performancecomputation for scientific and engineering problems, the biggest machinesrarely are the most cost-effective.andM;Even the world's most influential community of supercomputer users-theresearchers who use, at no cost, the National Science Foundation's six (andsoon to be five) supercomputing centers in tile United States-get relativelylittle processing power per year from the big machines at their disposal.andO;About 30 Cray X-MP processors are available to these researchers, whichrepresent about 240,000 processor hours per year.andP;  But there are so manyresearchers (10,000) that each gets little more than 24 hours per year ofsupercomputer use.andP;  That's just what a high-power Pc can deliver in a month.andO;There are many other factors besides machine availability that inhibitresearchers from getting the most out of supercomputers, including theinvestment they must make in understanding vector processing, parallelprocessing, memory hierarchies and other elements crucial to effective use ofsupercomputers.andM;Large, central supercomputing facilities are not necessarily flawed as asource of compute power, unless they attempt to be a one-stop solution.andP;  Theymay be the best resource for the very largest usSUPERWORKSTATIONS HOLD THEMOST PROMISE BECAUSE THEY EMBODY MORE LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES.andP;  ers withbig, highly tuned parallel programs that require any or all of the-following:large memories, file capacity of hundreds of gigabytes, archival files andthe capacity to share large databases and large programs.andP;  Largesupercomputers also suffice for the occasional user who needs only a fewhours of computing a year and doesn't want to own or operate a computer.andM;But the biggest iron is not very well suited to the needs of the majority ofusers working on engineering or scientific problems.andP;  The big supercomputerslack the interactive and visualization capabilities that computer-aideddesign requires, for example.andP;  As a result, even with free computer time,only a small fraction of the research community-5 to 10%uses the NSF centers.andO;The rest are buying smaller computing resources instead.andP;  To suchresearchers, less is indeed more.andP;  Shopping for Super SubstitutesandM;A user can opt for a super substitute if the system supplies at least 10% ofthe power of a conventional supercomputer.andP;  That's enough muscle for asupersubstitute to deliver at least the same amount of computation in one daythat the typical user could expect from a large, time shared supercomputer inone-half to two hours.andP;  The user should use three other criteria in selectinga super substitute: price/performance leadership in its class high throughputon a wide variety of jobs and appropriate memory and other resources.andO;Numerous machines types are contenders as supersubstitutes.andP;  Here's a rundownof them: * Workstations, minicomputers and superminicomputers .andP;  They are themost common technical computing platforms today.andP;  * Mainframe computers.andO;Those with vector processing features also rival supers in some cases.andP;  *andO;Massively parallel systems.andP;  Such machines contain hundreds, even thousandsof microprocessors capable of working simultaneously on a single program.andO;But many supercomputer applications have to be completely reprogrammed anexpensive investment by a user-to exploit the advantage of parallelarchitectures.andP;  * Minisupercomputers.andP;  Minisupers, as they are known, werethe first viable supersubstitutes, appearing in 1983.andP;  And they were acost-effective source of supercomputing capacity until 1988, whensuperworkstations first came on the scene.andP;  * Superworkstations.andP;  Thismachine class is the most vigorous of all technical computer categories,attracting the macBy THE YEAR 2000, NEARLY ALL PCS WILL HAVE THE CAPABILITYOF TODAY'S SUPERCOMPUTERS.andP;  jority of buyers and supplying the bulk of thecapacity for high-performance technical computing.andM;Of all these contenders, superworkstations hold the most promise for thedecade ahead because they embody more leading-edge technologies than anyother class of technical computer.andP;  Moreover, the benefits of thesetechnologies-such as reduced instruction set computing (RISC) andcomplementary metal oxide semiconductors  Cmos)are readily apparent to users.andO;Not only do the superworkstations deliver improved price/performance andbetter compiler techniques than supercomputers-standard fare for the leadingedge-they also enable users, via better interfaces, to more easily interactwith programs.andM;Radically new applications will spring up around superworkstations in muchthe same way that new uses for systems developed around the personalcomputer.andP;  And, like their PC counterparts, these applications won't just bedressedup versions of the code museums that populate the supercomputer,mainframe and minicomputer worlds.andP;  Although the scientific and engineeringfields will generate most of the radical new ideas, expect contributions fromthe commercial sector, as well.andP;  Several financial institutions, for example,are applying superworkstations for econometric modeling, work flowoptimization or portfolio analysis.andM;Because these machines are based on fast-evolving technologies, theirperformance can be expected to improve by 50% annually during the next fiveyears.andP;  The speed with which they execute programs also will accelerate, withclock rates of more than I 00 megahertz possible by 1992.andM;What's most promising, perhaps, about the future of superworkstations istheir natural appeal to user organizations already prone to invest indistributed computing technologies.andP;  U.S.andP;  corporations and their Europeanpeers are much quicker to embrace distributed computing than to invest insupercomputers, mainframe systems and minisupers-big ticket items that can bepainstakingly slow and convoluted to purchase and that have prices that limittheir acceptance and application.andP;  Superworkstations, by their distributednature, have a better chance of attracting creative, productive users withauthority to purchase machines in the $ 10,000-to-$50,000 range.andM;If, in fact, superworkstations assume such a significant role in the 1990s,what then will become of the supercomputer? For now, the supercomputercontinues to be a protected species because of its use in U.S.andP;  Department ofDefense applications.andP;  Like the Harley-Davidson motorcycle, the U.S.andO;supercomputer has become a token symbol of trade and competitiveness.andO;Japanese manufacturers have begun to make computers with peak speeds equal toor greater than those from Cray Research Inc. or Cray Computer Corp.andM;From an economic standpoint, U.S.andP;  and European information technologysuppliers are fortunate that their japanese rivals are expending the largedevelopment resources that supercomputers such as NEC Corp.'s sx-3 require,otherwise engineers in Tokyo and Osaka could be developing consumer andworkstation products that could have a far greater impact on Western markets.andM;In reality, the supercomputer is becoming a special purpose computer thatMINISUPERS, AS THEY ARE KNOWN, WERE THE FIRST VIABLE SUPERSUBSTITUTES.andP;  isreally only cost effective for highly parallel problems.andP;  It has about thesame performance as highly specialized, parallel computers like the  ThinkingMachines' Connection Machine, NCube's systems of the same name and IntelCorp.'s ipsc products.andP;  Yet the supercomputer costs 10 times as much as anyof those parallel systems because of its expensive circuit and memorytechnology.andP;  The evolution of the traditional supercomputer must change to amore massively parallel and scalable structure if it is to keep up with thepeak performance of evolving new machines.andP;  By 1995, specialized massivelyparallel computers capable of a trillion floating point operations per secondwill be available to stimualate a much wider range of physical phenomena.andM;By the year 2000, nearly all Pcs will have the capability of today'ssupercomputers.andP;  Such functionality will enable users to simulate immense andvaried models-the very basis of technical computing.andP;  In the interveningyears, superworkstations look to be the technology that engineers andscientists will harness to achieve the design, medical and otherbreakthroughs that will distinguish their professions.andP;  Option 1MINISUPERCOMPUTERS Strengths: Have computational capacity approaching oneCray Y-MP processor.andP;  Support a modestly interactive, distributed mode ofuse.andP;  Exploit the gap left when Digital began in earnest to ignore itstechnical user base.andP;  Price/performance is roughly the same as asupercomputer.andP;  Weakness: Overpriced and underpowered when compared withnewer classes of technical computers.andP;  Examples: Machines from AlliantComputer Systems Corp. and Convex Computer Corp. Advice: Watch how suppliersrespond to pressure from workstation and superworkstation rivals.andP;  Alliantplans to improve price/performance by migrating to Intel's i860 RISC chip asa source of cost-effective M FLOPS.andP;  Convex is likely to follow the Cray pathof achieving higher clock speeds by using emitter-coupled logic (ECL)technology.andP;  Option 2 SUPERWORKSTATIONS Strength: Provide between 10 and 33%of the compututional capacity of a single-processor Cray Y-MP at less than 3%of the cost.andP;  Weakness: Peak benchmark speed is only 2% of eight-processorCray Y-MP.andP;  Examples: These machines combine varying degrees of supercomputercapacity with integral 3-D graphics capabilities for project and departmentaluse (i.e., multiple users per system) at costs ranging between $50,000 and$200,000.andP;  Superworkstations from IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics andStardent-griced aggressively at $25,000 to $50,000 per machine make similarfeatures affordable for personal use.andP;  Notable is IBM's RS/ 6000 superscalarworkstation, on which several researchers have run programs at the same speedas on a Cray Y-MP.andP;  Advice: Distributed approach makes superworkstations moreeffective than supers.andP;  Option 3 MASSIVELY PARALLEL COMPUTERS Strength: Cansupply same peak delivered power (1.5GFLOPS) on select applications as a CrayY-MP/8.andP;  Weakness: Not suitable for general scientific work loads such aschemical modeling, whose applications can't readily take advantage ofmassively parallel architectures.andP;  Examples: Machines come in two forms.andO;Multicomputers, which connect hundreds of microprocessors together, are madeby the likes of intel, Inmos Corp. and NCube.andP;  Single-instruction, multipledatastream (SIMD) machines come from Thinking Machines, MasPar and others.andO;The notable exception is newcomer Kendall Square Research Corp.'smultiprocessor computerscalable up to 1,000 processors.andP;  It operates equallywell for both massive transaction processing and massively parallelcomputation.andP;  Unlike the SIMD or multicomputers, the Kendal Squaremultiprocessor is a general-purpose computer.andP;  Advice: Multicomputers andSIMD are not directly substitutable for current supers.andP;  With time, compilersshould be able to better exploit these architectures Option 4 MAINFRAMESStrength: Can provide up to 25% of peak Cray Y-MP's power at as little as 50%of the price.andP;  Weakness: Many mainframes cost more than some of the low-endCray models.andP;  The most representative machine, IBM 3090/600 with vectorfacilities, has only one-third of the capability of Cray Y-MP/B to carry outa given work load.andP;  Examples: IBM 3090s, Digital VAX 9000S.andP;  Advice: Nopractical cost benefit from substituting one centralized, timeshared resourcefor another.andP;  Option 5 WORKSTATIONS Strength: Provide up to 10% of thecapacity of a Cray Y-MP processor at less than 2% of the cost.andP;  Weakness:Relatively slow speed prevents them from hitting performance peaks incompute-intensive programs tor which the vector and parallel capabilities ofsupercomputers were developed.andP;  Examples: Machines from Digital,Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics and Sun.andP;  Advice: Not ideal as supersubstitutes.andP;  MINICOMPUTERS AND SUPERMINIS Strength: Provide up to 20% of thecapacity of a Cray Y-MP processor at less than 16% of the cost.andP;  Weakness:Only 0.25% of the peak speed of a Cray Y-MP.andP;  Examples: Midrange machinesfrom Digital, HP and others.andP;  Advice: Less than ideal super substitutes.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
