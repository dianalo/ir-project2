Gorbachev's reform programs have contributed toa 32 percent rise in the Soviet crime rate since January, officialssay.   Gorbachev has acknowledged that the restructuring he initiatedsince coming to power four years ago could lead to more crime.   Maj. Gen. Anatoly Smirnov of the Interior Ministry told a Moscownews conference Tuesday that ``the relaxation of discipline'' andshortages in basic commodities had fueled an increase in murder andother serious crimes.   Official figures show street crime increased over the samefive-month period in 1988 by 83 percent, property crimes by 53percent and murder by 26 percent, Smirnov said.   Nine Soviet policemen were killed in clashes with criminals inMay alone.   Shortages that have worsened steadily under economic experimentsbegun in recent years have created a demand for stolen goods thatspurs robbers on, according to the Smirnov.   He said the country's rail, air and river transport systems havebecome increasingly crime-ridden, especially with robbery andmugging.   The ministry also noticed a ``rise in the aggressiveness ofcertain citizens,'' the general said.   One crime-fighting experiment has shown good results, Smirnovsaid. In the Russian city of Gorky, where two policemen weremurdered this winter and residents were afraid to leave home atnight, creation of workers' militias to back up police cut the crimerate's growth by 38 percent.   Gorbachev told Communist Party leaders in a speech this springthat they should keep in mind that ``any extension of democracy andhumanization of life should go parallel with an uncompromisingstruggle against criminal elements.''   Police Col. Alexander Gurov estimated that more than a dozenmajor crime networks exist in the U.S.S.R., but he said Tuesday thatthere was no organization there on the scale of the Cosa Nostra, areference to organized crime in the United States.   ``The Cosa Nostra would go broke within a week here,'' Gurovsaid. ``The bureaucracy would smother it'' because the bribes itwould have to pay to get offices and basic supplies would proveprohibitive.   Police Col. Gennady Chebotarev said Tuesday that organized crimegot its start in the massive ``shadow economy'' of theft,embezzlement and unofficial wheeling-and-dealing that has thrivedsince the 1970's.   More than 1,000 organized crime groups are uncovered every year,often groups of more than 100 people _ frequently former athletes _who stake out territory and demand protection money, Chebotarev said.   He said organized groups of criminals have also begun to fosterties with international crime, particularly with computer imports,antiques, gold and jewels. Computers are in heavy demand in theSoviet Union, and speculators can make huge profits by buying andselling even relatively cheap computers.</TEXT></DOC>
