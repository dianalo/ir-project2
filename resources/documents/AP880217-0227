ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There are no medals when you come in sixth,observed sixth-place New Hampshire finisher Bruce Babbitt onWednesday. Nor are there headlines or chunks of money coming in,and by day's end it looked as if he and Republican Pete du Pontwere ready to call it quits.   ``We have drafted a statement,'' said Babbitt. ``It still hasthree conclusions to it and I have to check one of the boxes,'' hesaid. But the former Arizona governor conceded ``somebody wouldhave to make a persuasive pitch'' to keep him in the race.   Babbitt scheduled a news conference for Thursday morning. DuPont, who had not been heard from much after the New Hampshireprimary, scheduled one in the afternoon.   ``If you write a story that indicates we're going to bow out,you'll be OK,'' said a DuPont campaign source.   Only the presidential candidates named Bush, Dole, Dukakis andGephardt didn't have to face questions about their steadfastness inthe wake of the first primary. A strong third in this contestwasn't good enough, according to Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.   ``It makes a huge difference,'' said Simon on NBC's ``Today''show. ``First of all in media momentum _ the headlines in themorning newspaper have his name, rather than mine. It makes a greatdeal of difference in money.'' The ``he'' was Richard Gephardt whobested Simon 20 percent to 18 percent in the Democratic contest.The winner, of course, was Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,whose finish in his neighboring state came as no surprise.   Simon said he has to win either the Minnesota caucus or theSouth Dakota primary next Tuesday to stay in.   ``I cannot continue to run second and third in variousprimaries,'' he said. ``You have to win somewhere. And there's nosense in fooling myself or fooling those who follow me.''   So Simon gave himself another week. Babbitt said he was of``divided mind'' on what to do.   ``I will indulge myself the luxury of agonizing no more than 24hours,'' he said, leaving New Hampshire for Washington. ``My moodthis morning is plaid. There are no medals for sixth.''   He planned to spend the day on the telephone. ``What I'm goingto ask my frinds is, you know, `Can I or should I throw it in andacknowledge reality?'''   One man's reality, however, was another man's vindication.   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., of Tennessee, who didn't campaign asintensely as the other Democrats in New Hampshire, looked forwardto the Super Tuesday primaries next month when 1,307 Democraticdelegates will be picked in 20 states.   ``We made a decision not to spend $1 million on two or threedelegates,'' he said. ``We're saving that for the 1,400 delegateshere in the Super Tuesday states.'' He called the results in NewHampshire, and last week in Iowa, inconclusive.   Jesse Jackson, who came in fourth in New Hampshire with 8percent of the vote, said the two contests so far ``proved we couldbroaden our base.''   Among white families, he was asked by Kathleen Sullivan of ABC's``Good Morning.''   ``White families,'' replied Jackson. ``We've found where thatpoint of challenge is. It is that at the plant gate which closed onworkers without notice, as in Kenosha, Wis., where there's aclosure with too little notice, or where farmers are losing theirfarms. When they do that, the lights are cut off and people lookamazingly similar in the dark.''   And Gary Hart, last among seven Democrats with 4 percent, tookcomfort in doing ``500 percent better than Iowa'' where he barelygot 1 percent.   ``We have just begun, we are committed,'' he said.   On the Republican side, Jack Kemp saw his third-place finish asa victory in a ``race for conservatives'' among himself, PatRobertson and Pete du Pont. The other race was one ``for thetraditional, moderate wing of the party'' between Vice PresidentGeorge Bush, who won New Hampshire, and Sen. Bob Dole who came insecond.   ``Finally we've dragged Bush and Dole out of discussing theirresumes and their tax returns and where they're born and intodiscussing issues,'' Kemp said.   Du Pont returned home to Wilmington, Del., late last night andwasn't saying much publicly about his 10 percent of the vote andwhat it meant to his future as a presidential candidate. His officesaid he was meeting with advisers, presumably discussing thatquestion.   ``We're solvent right now and we have enough money to run thecampaign for another two weeks,'' said du Pont press secretary FredStern.   For his part, Robertson also was looking to Super Tuesday toovercome a 9 percent showing, dead last, in New Hampshire.   ``They're going to be playing in my backyard,'' he said. And,addressing Bush and Dole, the Virginia-born Robertson said: ``I'mgoing to beat you there convincingly.''</TEXT></DOC>
