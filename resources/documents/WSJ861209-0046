JacobsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/09/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TAXES </IN><TEXT>   Many thousands of engineers and computer specialists who work as independent contractors are belatedly discovering that the new tax law may end their independence and the tax benefits that go with it.    Overlooked until recently, Section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 applies to &quot;an engineer, designer, drafter; computer programmer, systems analyst, or other similarly skilled worker engaged in a similar line of work.&quot;    The new law subjects them to common-law standards for determining who is an employee. Under existing law, a &quot;safe harbor&quot; provision has permitted them, as independent contractors, to be exempted by the Internal Revenue Service from treatment as common-law employees with less generous tax benefits.    No one seems to know exactly how many technical specialists may be affected. But California alone, a state tax official estimates, has as many as 250,000 who may be. Congress has estimated that the change in the law will raise $60 million in additional taxes in the next five years.    Big employers of contract specialists are now trying to determine how to conform with the law when it takes effect Jan. 1. The California Institute of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, which employs about 2,000 technical people under contracts, has a task force studying the new law, a spokesman says.    The independent workers are concerned. &quot;It is creating havoc among the independent consultants, whether they are going direct to the client (for work) or through a broker,&quot; says Jack Christiansen, executive director of the Independent Computer Consultants Association.    Independent contractors enjoy several tax advantages. No payroll taxes are withheld from their paychecks, they can finance more-generous retirement plans and they can take business-expense deductions unavailable to employees.    Only technical-service workers lose the &quot;safe harbor&quot; for independent contractors and become subject to common-law standards, under which most of them would be classed as employees. They work on company premises, can be dismissed, are paid by the hour and run no risk of losing money on an assignment, all of which are common-law earmarks of employee status. A provision in the new tax law also suggests that for individuals, being incorporated won't allow them to escape the common-law definition of an employee. Apparently, independent contractors in nontechnical professions, such as real estate or free-lance artists, aren't affected.    The independent computer specialists often find work through brokers, who supply banks, insurance companies, aerospace manufacturers and the government with data-processing personnel. Brokers normally take a 10% markup on the hourly rate paid the specialists. In Southern California, a skilled programmer typically earns $35 an hour, $1,400 for a 40-hour week.    The brokers have had no payroll-tax burden. But if the specialists they supply to industry become their employees, they will have federal and state payroll taxes to pay and the responsibility to withhold taxes payable by their employees.    &quot;It will cost us about 15% more to do business,&quot; says Phyliss Murphy, president of P. Murphy andamp; Associates Inc., a Toluca Lake, Calif., broker with about 70 computer specialists on jobs at aircraft, chemical and insurance concerns.    Ms. Murphy recently told her specialists that they must sign W-4 withholding forms and become P. Murphy employees next year. &quot;Their reaction has been like someone dying,&quot; she says. &quot;You get rage, usually directed at the law, sometimes at us. Then you get disbelief,&quot; she says. Most of the specialists have accepted regular employment as inevitable, she says, but a few are holding out in hope of remaining independent.    An independent programmer in Los Angeles, who asked not to be identified, has a one-year contract with an agency that assigned him to a government project, where he has worked for about three years. He says the agency wants him to become an employee and take less pay to offset its higher costs, an offer with little appeal. &quot;Right away, I would get a greatly reduced net income and not be able to deduct many things I currently deduct,&quot; he says.    He also says employment with the agency means &quot;I would have none of the benefits an employee of a large company would get,&quot; such as life, disability and medical insurance, which he now provides himself.    The programmer and others fear, too, that becoming employees will turn the IRS spotlight on their past years' tax returns, which they filed as independent contractors, even though they have been protected by the law's &quot;safe harbor.&quot;    What should independents do? Treat a broker's request to become a W-2 employee as an offer of employment and nothing more, says Jeffrey M. Jacobs, a director of the Independent Computer Consultants Association's Los Angeles chapter, who has been counseling independents. Becoming a broker's employee, he warns, &quot;means you are out of business as an independent businessman.&quot;    At a meeting attended by 300 computer consultants last week, &quot;the general feeling was that no one wants to convert to an employee, and we are advising them to hold firm,&quot; Mr. Jacobs said.    Companies that continue to treat regularly employed technical specialists as independent contractors will run the risk of having the IRS declare them employees and levy payroll taxes plus penalties on the employers.    Some large technical-service suppliers already prefer to hire employees, whose work they can more efficiently control, over independent contractors. One supplier, Computer Horizons Corp., has nearly 700 specialists on its payroll, says Bernard Hubert, senior vice president for finance at the Parsippany, N.J., firm, and uses independents when it has no alternative.    For brokers who supply independent contractors, the change in the law eliminates a competitive edge. It will subject them to the same payroll and administrative costs that competitors like Computer Horizons already bear. Indeed, Adapso, a computer-services trade association, last week adopted a resolution supporting the change. &quot;It does assure that all companies will be operating on an equal footing,&quot; a spokesman said.    But the American Consulting Engineers Council, many of whose 4,100 members will be affected, is displeased. &quot;It will mean a severe dislocation of small businesses,&quot; a spokesman says. So far, however, there's been little reaction from the membership to the change. &quot;We only heard about it in the last week,&quot; the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
