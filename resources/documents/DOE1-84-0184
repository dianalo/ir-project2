<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-84-0184 </DOCNO><TEXT>The cyclic voltammetric response for 'two-electron' transfer processesis studied for vertical strokeE/sub 2//sup {Theta}/vertical stroke {le}vertical strokeE/sub 1//sup {Theta}/vertical stroke: reversible E/sub1//sup {Theta}/ B reversible E/sub 2//sup {Theta}/ C. Evaluation of theEE mechanism has been generalized to those cases where the standard heterogeneousrate constants k/sub 1//sup 0/ and k/sub 2//sup 0/ of both charge transfersteps may take any value between the reversible and irreversible limitsand differ by one to two orders of magnitude. A correct interpretationof the cyclic voltammograms demands that the homogeneous disproportionationreaction: 2B reversible A+C be included (EE-DISP). Simulated voltammogramsand working curves are presented. Their use opens a way for the quantitativedetermination of the thermodynamic and heterogeneous kinetic parametersof 'two-electron' transfer reactions.</TEXT></DOC>
