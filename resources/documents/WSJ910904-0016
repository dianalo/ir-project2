The American Bar Association'sModel Rules of Professional Conduct, which have been adoptedin whole or in part by many states, permits breaches of theattorney-client privilege &quot;to prevent the client fromcommitting a criminal act that the lawyer believes is likelyto result in imminent death or substantial bodily harm.&quot; Theacademy's rules go further in that they would actuallyrequire disclosure of threatened child abuse.   Prof. Aronson said that the academy's suggestedrequirement that even past abuse be disclosed would conflictwith ethical rules in most states, including California. &quot;Onehope is that this will provoke sufficient concern anddiscussion,&quot; he said, and that states will change theirrules.   Geoffrey Hazard Jr., a professor of ethics at YaleUniversity's law school, said the rule raises difficultethical and moral questions. He said that many lawyers arebound to see the disclosure requirement as a &quot;first step downa slippery slope&quot; leading to mandatory disclosure of other,less serious client misdeeds.   He said the rule, even if it is not adopted by states,might lead to civil suits by abuse victims against lawyers.Plaintiffs might argue that lawyers should be held liable fortheir injuries because they did not follow a &quot;recognizedstandard of practice,&quot; Mr. Hazard said.   Other rules issued by the academy yesterday are meant toguide lawyers through murky family disputes. Attorneys wouldbe required to advise clients &quot;of the emotional and economicimpact of divorce&quot; and suggest the possibility ofreconciliation. Lawyers should also encourage clients topursue the negotiation, mediation or arbitration of disputes,the rules state.   Lawyers are warned not to engage in a sexual relationshipwith a client or opposing counsel and &quot;not to permit aclient's friends, lovers, employers&quot; or others to interferein divorce cases.   &quot;An attorney should refuse to assist in vindictiveconduct. . . . and should not do anything to increase theemotional level of the dispute,&quot; the rules add.   Finally, the rules set forth guidelines for feearrangements and other aspects of attorney-clientrelationships.   Sanford S. Dranoff, the academy's president, said that theChicago-based group is considering requiring that divorcelawyers promise to follow the rules before becoming members.   But Raoul Felder, a well-known New York divorce lawyer andan academy member, thinks the rules are unnecessary. &quot;I seeno reason to single out divorce lawyers,&quot; he said. &quot;I thinkit heightens the perception that divorce {law} is on thesleazier end of the Richter scale.&quot;   ---   SPLIT DECISION ISSUED by appeals court in NFL pensiondispute.   A federal court of appeals in Virginia affirmed a lowercourt decision requiring the National Football League clubowners to contribute $17.8 million plus interest to theplayers' pension fund.   But at the same time the appeals panel reversed theMaryland trial court's decision that payments to formerplayers had to be increased and that three fund trustees wereliable for breaching their fiduciary responsibilities to fundbeneficiaries. And that ruling lets three NFL executives,including an owner of the Phoenix Cardinals, off the hook ofa $17.8 million penalty.   It's not sudden death, but both sides claimed victory.   The case concerned a dispute over contributions to theBert Bell National Football League Retirement plan. The plan,named after a former NFL commissioner, covers all players andtheir dependents since 1960 who played at least four years inthe NFL.   Under the 1982 collective-bargaining agreement betweenowners and players, the clubs were required to contribute$12.5 million each year to the fund, which is administered bya board comprising three player representatives and threeowner representatives.   In 1984, the owners refused to contribute the full $12.5million because the value of investments held by the pensionfund had increased to the extent that the plan wasoverfunded. Therefore, the owners argued, they would not beable to fully deduct their contribution from taxes asrequired by the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement.   The players' trustees wanted the pension board to demandthe full amount from the owners. They also wanted the boardto increase pension payouts to former players, who nowreceive an average of about $385 per month. But the ownertrustees balked. They filed a suit asking a judge to decidewhether the contributions were deductible.   The players' trustees then filed a counterclaim accusingthe owners' trustees of breaching their fiduciaryresponsibility to the fund's beneficiaries. They also filedanother suit demanding full payment from the clubs of the$12.5 million.   &quot;We would have been much happier if the court had said theboard had a duty to increase benefits,&quot; said Joseph A.Yablonski, of Yablonski, Both andamp; Edelman, a Washington lawfirm that represented the players' trustees. But he calledthe ruling a victory because the owners will have tocontribute to the plan the full amount plus double interestunder federal pension laws. &quot;That's a slam dunk,&quot; he said.   The owners were equally pleased with the decision. &quot;Thisagain shows that union claims of so-called victories in thecourts are more rhetoric than substance,&quot; said Greg Aiello,spokesman for the league. &quot;The fourth circuit reversed thelower court's decision on two important points.&quot;   ---   NOTED: Rinaldo Petrignani, the former Italian ambassadorto the U.S., has joined the 330-lawyer firm of Rogers andamp; Wellsas a consultant on European and U.S. business affairs.
