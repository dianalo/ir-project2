He's trying to reachWashington City, where he believes his older brother, Carter (Campbell Scott),a Confederate soldier, lies dying from wounds received at Gettysburg.;    Atthe same time, President Lincoln is fraught with despair over the worseningcondition of his ailing son, Tad (Andrew Winton), and the awesome number ofcasualties on both sides of the epic conflict at Gettysburg.;    Hated bySoutherners and disliked by enormous numbers of war-numbed Northerners aswell, Lincoln has fallen so low that hardly anyone wants to hear him when herises to deliver the brief words of dedication at the new national cemetery atGettysburg -- words that would later be cited as among the most eloquent inAmerican history.;    The story of how this troubled president's path crossesthat of the desperate 13-year-old from Atlanta is the core of &quot;The PerfectTribute.&quot; Only the hardhearted will be unmoved by the sentimental climax.;   Though the incident never happened, most of the events leading up to it did,including the film's most spellbinding sequence -- Lincoln's delivery of hisGettysburg Address to a stunned crowd wholly unprepared for its compellingdepth of feeling.;    Indeed, this is a great television moment, as Robardsgives new dimensions of power to the words so familiar to millions.;    &quot;ThePerfect Tribute&quot; is the work of first-time screenwriter Dennis Brown, ajournalist and sometime lecturer aboard the famed Delta Queen steamboat. Hetook it from the short story by Mary Raymond Shipman Andrews, first publishedin Scribner's magazine in 1905. Reprinted in book form, it sold 600,000copies, a phenomenal number in its day.;    The movie shows us how worn-downAmericans were after three years of fighting each other. Most of thecharacters are weary and heartsick, hoping for any miracle to bring thiscatastrophic thing to a close.;    The exception is young Benjamin, who'splaying war with his tin soldiers at his Atlanta home when we first meet him.Still untouched by the war, he's able to imagine only the glory of it all.;   In sharp counterpoint, the movie alternates scenes from the horrors ofGettysburg as Ben hums to himself and fights his tabletop battle: slugsthumping into human chests, sending out great gouts of blood, the infernalpounding of cannon, the screams of the wounded, the deafening buzz of theflies.;    One of those who falls is his brother, who winds up with a terriblewound in his chest, slowly dying from the bullet the Union doctor tending himcan't remove.;    It's not until Ben begins his impulsive quest into enemyterritory that he sees war for what it really is. Hiding, he stumbles over astiffening corpse in the woods. Starving, he's denied food by even theConfederate troops he meets. The one Southern soldier who befriends him issuddenly killed -- quietly, with a neat round hole in his forehead.;    At thesame time, Lincoln is shocked by the early casualty figures from Gettysburg:3,000 Union dead and 15,000 wounded against 2,600 Confederate dead and 13,000wounded -- in just three days of fighting.;    Robards is brilliant asLincoln, assuming the character naturally without any trace of caricature.(Robards has played Lincoln twice before on TV, the last time in 1964.) HisLincoln is a sad, almost pathetic figure but infused with great humanity andvery likable.;    Young Lukas Haas (the memorable Amish boy in &quot;Witness&quot;) isalso exceptional, as Benjamin, particularly in the scene in which he reads theGettysburg Address aloud from the newspaper to his brother and the man hedoesn't realize is Lincoln himself.;    &quot;The Perfect Tribute&quot; is also loadedwith very strong supporting players, including a surprising dramatic cameo byKatherine Helmond (&quot;Who's the Boss?&quot;) as a war-deadened farm woman who helpsBenjamin along the way.;    Among the others: Jeanne Tripplehorn as a Unionnurse who treats Ben's brother with compassion despite the death of her ownman at Rebel hands; Oscar-winner Jose Ferrer as Edward Everett, the primaryspeaker at the Gettysburg memorial, who admits Lincoln's soaring speech hashumbled him, and Emmy-winner Ed Flanders (&quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;), the newspaperpublisher who has grown tired of Lincoln until riding with him to Gettysburg.;   &quot;The Perfect Tribute&quot; is another jewel in the crown of producer Dorothea G.Petrie, whose award-laden TV films include &quot;Caroline?&quot; &quot;Love Is Never Silent&quot;and &quot;Foxfire.&quot; With our national interest in the period still running highafter last year's acclaimed &quot;The Civil War&quot; series on PBS, &quot;The PerfectTribute&quot; should receive a warm welcome from viewers and leave them feelingmuch better for the experience.
