One of the most essential features of the membrane material istensile strength because the air-supported dome gets the tension as highas several tens Kgf/cm from an especially strong wind. The strength inthe directions crossing at right angle and that at a joint are important.There are various types of composite membrane depending upon the combinationof woven cloth and coating layer. The combination of tetrafluoro-ethylene(TFE) and glass fibre fabric shows the highest performance at present.The fines glass fibre 3 {mu} in diameter has the highest tensile strengthand flex resistance. Poplin fabric with the density of warp 20 to 30%higher than that of weft of glass fibre was used. The woven cloth isdipped in the dispersion of TFE and heated to coat with TFE. The coatinghas a thickness of 100 to 150 {mu}m and it is air- and water-tight. Joiningof membrane material to each other is made by the high-frequency weldingmethod and the strength of the joint is 90% of that of the material itself.The performance tests including tensile, tearing, light transmissionand incombustibility tests are made in accordance with the test methodsspecified in JIS. The life is 20 to 30 years.(12 figs, 3 tabs, 8 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
