Abortion foes and their lawyers attacked the decision, calling ita serious setback for people who practice civil disobedience.   A three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals onThursday upheld a lower court decision that the protesters violatedracketeering laws by conspiring to prevent abortions at NortheastWomen's Center Inc., a Philadelphia clinic. The court also awardedabout $110,000 in damages and attorneys' fees to the center.   The center's lawsuit was the first test of the federal RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in a civil case againstabortion demonstrators, said Edmond A. Tiryak, the lawyer whobrought the action for the clinic.   ``From our point of view, this is an important example that willbe used nationally,'' he said. The lawsuit has been used as a modelby other clinics in as many as 11 other cases still at the triallevel, he said.   The center had charged that the protesters used force, threatsand trespassing to intimidate center employees and women seekingabortions.   ``What's been going on at the center has been intimidation andfear,'' said Tiryak. ``This opinion, I think, strikes a blow at thevery heart of that activity by the pro-life movement.''   An anti-abortion leader named in the suit lambasted the decisionbut predicted it wouldn't stop future demonstrations.   ``The American judicial system has taken a vengeance againstanyone who tries to stand up for children in the womb,'' saidMichael McMonagle, executive director of the Pro-Life Coalition ofSoutheast Pennsylvania.   Nevertheless, he said that since the lawsuit was filed in 1987,``the rescue movement has taken off the ground, and RICO suits can'tstop it now.''   The RICO Act has most often been used against organized crimefigures, but Tiryak said it was applicable in the case becauseprotesters used extortion _ in the form of threats and force _ todeny the center its right to operate and to deny women their rightto use the center.   The appelate panel unanimously upheld a June 1987 finding by afederal district jury that the protesters had engaged in a patternof criminal activity from 1984 to 1986 designed to prevent thecenter from providing abortions.   The appeals court said videotapes made by the center ``revealeddemonstrators pushing, shoving and tugging on patients as theyattempted to approach the center, knocking over and crossing policebarricades and blocking the ingress of cars.''   The court rejected the protesters' argument that their actionswere justified because of the issue, saying they could have usednumerous legal alternatives to persuade women not to have abortions``short of harassment.''   Tiryak contended the center lost its lease and was forced to movebecause of the protests.   McMonagle claimed no protester was ever charged with assault,even though police were present at the demonstrations.   ``Pushing doesn't make a racketeer, doesn't make extortionist,''he said.   McMonagle said the protesters will request that the full appealscourt review the decision by the three-judge panel.   The appeals court ordered the district court to further considerinjunctions the center is seeking to limit the number ofdemonstrators outside the center and prohibit them from usingbullhorns.   Meanwhile, a federal judge in Los Angeles issued a temporaryrestraining order barring the anti-abortion group Operation Rescuefrom blockading women's health clinics in California during itsplanned Easter week protests.   U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter's order, which was sought by theAmerican Civil Liberties Union, instructs protesters to stay atleast 15 feet away from clinics.   Operation Rescue leaders said they hoped to assemble 10,000demonstrators in Los Angeles to blockade clinics from March 22-25.</TEXT></DOC>
