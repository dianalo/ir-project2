But for the Yavne students, his solution raises problems of its own.    &quot;Mr. Peres,&quot; asks one youth, &quot;what will happen if we give the territories back and the Arabs won't come to work here anymore?&quot;    His question probes the frequently overlooked economic dimension to Israel's military crisis in its occupied territories. During its 20-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the Palestinian population of the territories has ballooned 40% and moved in growing numbers onto the bottom rungs of the Israeli work force.    Disenfranchised Palestinians now find themselves economically dependent on the state they abhor. The riots of the past six weeks in the occupied areas, in which nearly 40 Palestinians have died, have been led by enraged youths who don't want any part of dependence.    Israelis, meanwhile, are witnessing a metamorphosis of their pioneering tradition. The one-time Jewish socialist state has come to rely on Arab hirelings for much of its dirty work.    &quot;We're now a society where employment levels are governed by racial distinctions,&quot; says Abba Eban, one of Israel's founders and a member of its parliament. &quot;If a man is filling your gas tank, you know he's going to be an Arab. If somebody comes to clean our toilets or wash our dishes or serve in the cheaper hotels, he's bound to be an Arab.&quot;    Mr. Eban even tells a grim joke about this fundamental change: A proud Zionist grandmother boasts to her grandchild that her husband built roads, drained swamps and toiled 18 hours a day to build the state of Israel. &quot;Grandma,&quot; the astonished child exclaims, &quot;I didn't know Grandpa was an Arab.&quot;    Within its pre-1967 borders, Israel's population is 4.4 million people, of whom about 82% are Jews. But the Arab population of the occupied territories has grown to 1.4 million, with a birthrate 2 1/2 times that of the Jews. Some demographers predict that the Jewish and Arab populations under Israeli control will attain parity by 2010.    During the oil boom, Persian Gulf states provided Israel with a population pressure valve, drawing large numbers of Palestinians to good jobs. But since the plunge in oil prices, Palestinians have had little choice but to take the low-paid, low-status jobs that most Israelis don't want. More than 30% of West Bank Palestinians and 46% of Gazans now go to work in Israel -- typically as field hands, construction laborers and sanitation workers.    Israel, in turn, supplies the occupied areas with 90% of their imported goods. Palestinians wear Israeli-made clothes, buy Hebrew-labeled groceries and sell &quot;I Love Israel&quot; T-shirts in souvenir stalls.    &quot;If someone wants to write political graffiti, he has to use Israeli wall paint,&quot; says Sari Nusseibeh, a professor of philosophy at the West Bank university of Bir Zeit.    Arab laborers even pour the cement at Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, building homes for the very Israelis who are most opposed to returning the lands to the Arabs.    In Gaza, the links between the two hostile communities are particularly vivid. Before dawn, laborers stream from concrete-block refugee camps and cluster along the potholed highway to Tel Aviv. Clutching lunch bags containing pita bread and oranges, each tries to flag a ride in already-overcrowded cars. Every day as many as 60,000 workers join the caterpillar of traffic edging along the only northern road out of Gaza.    &quot;All of us feel sick that we have to work for Israelis,&quot; says Ayoub Loubad, beating his arms against his sides to ward off the early-morning chill.    Six days a week, Mr. Loubad leaves home at 5 a.m. for a journey that can take as long as four hours. On the way, he passes Ashkelon, an Israeli coastal city as sparkling as Gaza is squalid. &quot;My father's house is there,&quot; he says, pointing out the home his family fled during Israel's 1948 war for independence. &quot;Israelis live in it now.&quot; After a day's labor as a presser in a garment factory, Mr. Loubad faces the same grueling trip home. For his 14 hours of travel and work, he earns $20.    Workers who try to avoid the long commute do so illegally, because Gazans aren't permitted to spend the night in Israel.    Since the disturbances broke out in Gaza last month, the traffic to Tel Aviv has often been thin, with many workers detained in their camps by army curfews and others striking to protest shootings and deportations. On a recent morning Mr. Loubad had to dodge stones hurled by youths angry that he wasn't striking.    With a wife and two small children, the 24-year-old Mr. Loubad says he can't afford to strike. Nevertheless he supports the rock-throwers. &quot;I wish they had machine guns,&quot; he says.    For many Palestinians, says Bir Zeit's Mr. Nusseibeh, this mix of anger and dependence creates intolerable stress.    &quot;The body of the Palestinian people has been sinking deeper into Israeli society, but the head has been left out,&quot; he says. &quot;The stretch between people's consciousness as Palestinians and their reality -- as laborers for Israelis or consumers of Israeli goods -- is becoming unbearable.&quot;    Nevertheless, Palestinians have reaped economic benefits from their participation in the Israeli economy. In Gaza, the gross national product rose in 1986 to about $1,000 a person from $100 in 1968. On the West Bank, it increased to around $1,400 from $300. When Egypt controlled Gaza before the Israeli occupation, unemployment was around 40%. Today most Gazans can find some kind of work, even if it means waiting in the public squares of Israeli cities for day labor that pays about $10.    &quot;But it isn't any good telling a Palestinian he's doing well compared to an Egyptian,&quot; says one Israeli government official. &quot;He doesn't compare himself to Egyptians; he compares himself to me, because he's working for me.&quot; That comparison generally remains odious: Israel's per-capita income is four or five times as high as Palestinians', while Israelis sometimes earn double the wages of Arabs in comparable jobs.    Instead of negotiating a return of Arab territories, as advocated by the Labor Party's Mr. Peres, some Israelis propose using the labor market to control the Arab population.    Earlier this month, Israel's labor minister, Moshe Katzav, threatened to replace Palestinians with European guest workers if strikes or civil disobedience proliferated. Other Israelis say Palestinians would be forced to migrate if they were banned from work in the state.    To Mr. Peres, the idea that Israel should be reliant on any kind of underclass is repugnant, as he made clear to his young interrogator in Yavne. &quot;Jews should come back to work,&quot; he told the student. &quot;We worked before we had the territories, and it would only do good for our economy if we had to work again.&quot;    Mr. Peres sees the labor issue as just one aspect of Israel's demographic problem, which he intends to make a crucial theme in elections, currently scheduled for November. He often peppers his speeches with figures on the rising tide of Palestinian population and the threat it poses to Israel's future as a democracy and a Jewish state.    But Mr. Peres's rival, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, doesn't see such a threat. Mr. Shamir &quot;isn't interested in demography,&quot; says his spokesman, Avi Pazner. &quot;He thinks it's just an invention by Israelis who want to frighten the electorate into giving back the territories.&quot;    Mr. Shamir, a member of the Likud bloc, looks to an increase in aliya, or immigration, to raise the numbers of Jews, just as it did in Israel's early years. &quot;If we hadn't had faith 40 years ago, if we'd thought about demography, we wouldn't have established this state,&quot; Mr. Pazner says.    That view is &quot;idiotic,&quot; says Labor's Mr. Eban, who sees the demographic problem and its effects on Israeli society as inextricably linked to the state's ability to draw migrants. Mr. Eban often speaks on migration to groups of Jews in Britain and the U.S. &quot;I tell them American and British Jews aren't replenishing our manpower and therefore they aren't giving Israel what Israel needs most,&quot; he says.    But he understands his audiences' reservations about Israel's drift from democracy. &quot;They aren't used to living in countries where a man's rights are defined by his ethnic origin,&quot; he says.    Jews abroad are &quot;tormented&quot; by images of Israeli violence, he adds. His sister, who lives in England, recently was watching television with her grandchildren when they saw an Israeli soldier clubbing a young Palestinian in the testicles.    &quot;Well, why are her grandchildren going to want to come and live in Israel?&quot; he asks. </TEXT></DOC>
