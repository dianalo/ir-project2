For the second quarter ended March 31, Charter posted a$67 million loss on revenue of $475.2 million. The yearearlier, the psychiatric-care company based in Macon, Ga.,had a $14.6 million loss on revenue of $397.3 million.</LP><TEXT>   Part of Charter's latest loss reflected a wider thanexpected $35 million pretax charge for &quot;inaccurate recordingof previously reported contractual allowances, bad debts andexpense accruals.&quot; The company had estimated in March that itwould take a $28 million charge for the accounting problems.For the March quarter, Charter also incurred $11.2 million inpretax charges for canceled development projects and a lostlawsuit.   Charter's chief financial officer, C. Michael Ford, saidthe company has already taken steps, including cutbacks incapital-spending and cost-cutting programs, to &quot;protectbondholders and employees.&quot; He declined to say whether anymanagers or employees had been dismissed in connection withthe accounting problems. In the long term, Mr. Ford said, &quot;Wethink Charter is viable, and we can meet our debt-servicerequirements and continue to operate the company.&quot;   But some Wall Street analysts said Charter's basicbusiness -- separate from the write-offs -- appeared tosuffer in the latest quarter. &quot;Their cash flow as apercentage of revenue dropped to 15.8% from 26.3%,&quot; saidMeredith Adler, an analyst at First Boston Corp. &quot;That'sdisappointing.&quot; Ms. Adler said Charter faced pressure on theaverage length of patient stay, and on its adolescent-carebusiness.   Charter's business slump intensified worries about thecompany's ability to handle its $1.5 billion in long-termdebt. The company's 14% senior subordinated bonds, which hadtraded at 70 cents on the dollar in March, were quotedyesterday at 48 cents to 50 cents on the dollar. Other,pay-in-kind bonds were quoted as low as 23 cents on thedollar yesterday.   &quot;Charter could face significant cash-flow shortfalls overthe next five years,&quot; analyst Roger Gordon of Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. warned. &quot;The company couldbe forced to restructure its long-term debt.&quot; Mitch Bartlett,an analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., also predicted thatCharter's latest results &quot;spell a restructuring for thecompany.&quot;   Charter, however, asserted that it can pull through. Mr.Ford said the company has reduced planned capitalexpenditures for the year to $140 million from $200 million.That, he said, combined with cost reductions in, among otherareas, marketing and advertising programs, should enableCharter to meet its debt payments and still completeconstruction of four additional psychiatric hospitals in thenext nine months or so.   &quot;We don't anticipate having to restructure debt,&quot; Mr. Fordsaid.   Mr. Ford acknowledged that insurance companies and otherpayers of medical bills are increasing pressure on healthcareproviders -- particularly providers of psychiatric care -- toreduce the length of patient stays and to cut bills. But thatpressure, he said, has been offset at Charter by an increasein patient admissions -- up 20% in the most recent quarter.   Charter had been advised in its 1988 buy-out by DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc., which also underwrote high-risk,high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds that helped finance the transaction.Drexel ceased most operations this past winter, leavingCharter to search for a new Wall Street adviser.   Despite Charter's current problems, Mr. Ford said Drexelhad been &quot;very helpful&quot; in structuring the initial buy-outand selling the debt. He added that the plan to go privatewas -- and still is -- a good idea. &quot;It was a chance foremployers and management to benefit from their own work,&quot; hesaid. &quot;Employee ownership increases productivity.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
