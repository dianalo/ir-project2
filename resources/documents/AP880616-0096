(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After more than four decades of dusty travelsentertaining fans around the minor leagues, the ``Clown Prince ofBaseball,'' Max Patkin, is getting a chance to show his antics onthe big screen.   Patkin, 68, plays himself in his motion picture debut in ``BullDurham,'' a baseball comedy opening in theaters this week.   ``More people will know who I am, and that feels pretty good,''said Patkin, who lives in the Philadelphia suburb of King ofPrussia.   Patkin's acting career began in the 1940s, when an injury endedthe young pitcher's dream of playing in the big leagues. He stillmade it _ but as a baseball clown, contorting his face andprominent nose while mimicking baseball people with exaggeratedgestures.   Writer-director Ron Shelton caught Patkin's act in the early1960s while Shelton was a second baseman in the minors.   ``He was just a kid,'' Patkin recalled. ``We palled around alittle bit back then, and years later, he wrote me into the film.''</TEXT><DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Georgia state Sen.
