Kryuchkov said in an interview.   If the CIA wants help, ``You can be sure that our reaction wouldbe positive,'' Kryuchkov told the visiting AP board of directorsand executives on Wednesday.   He said his agency is also willing to work with U.S.intelligence in fighting international terrorism and narcoticstrafficking.   The balding, white-haired Kryuchkov sat beneath a portrait ofSoviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin. Beside the KGB chief was a vaseof bright flowers that contrasted with the stark decor of thewood-paneled conference room on the third floor of the Lubyanka,the gray, pink and yellow KGB headquarters in downtown Moscow.   On his left hung a portrait of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of theSoviet secret police.   He joked with the group about the fear the KGB and the Lubyankainspired but said in serious tones that the agency was leavingbehind that ``tragic page'' of history.   In meetings with American officials, Kryuchkov said, ``we alwaysgive signals about being ready to work together in this or thatfield'' with U.S. intelligence.   ``The signals reach the right address,'' he said, but the answeris always something along the lines of, ``We are not ready yet.''   It was not clear precisely what sort of information the Sovietsmight be willing to offer the United States. Most Iraqi militaryequipment is Soviet-made, and providing intelligence on how todefeat that equipment in battle might undermine the effectivenessof the Soviet military in any possible confrontation with theUnited States.   Moreover, Kryuchkov acknowledged, the Kremlin is concerned aboutpossible Iraqi actions against Soviets who remain in that country.   The Soviet Union still has about 5,000 specialists in Iraq,Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said in a separatebriefing.   ``We used to have about 8,000 experts,'' including non-militaryspecialists, he said.   ``We said that we evacuated children and women ... which is notexactly correct. We evacuated spouses and children. There are somewomen experts still there. So far, 2,500 persons left Iraq, all thechildren, all the spouses,'' he said.   ``The Soviet community is slightly more than 5,000. About 60 ofthem are women, these are experts of different Sovietestablishments there, say, typists,'' said Gerasimov.   ``The experts whose contracts expire leave the country usingAeroflot regular flights,'' he said, referring to the Sovietgovernment airline. ``Iraqi authorities did not make anyimpediments to that.''   Kryuchkov, in his interview with the AP, also denied that theSoviet government had planted electronic eavesdropping devices inthe new U.S. Embassy office building in Moscow.   U.S. officials have accused the KGB of lacing the brickstructure with sophisticated bugging devices. The Bushadministration is weighing plans to destroy the structure and buildanother at a cost of tens of millions of dollars.   Kryuchkov said he envisioned the day when the two superpowerswould no longer spy on each other.   Already, he said, ``We do not consider the United States ofAmerica our main enemy.''   In the interview, Kryuchkov also said he did not want to see theKGB divided into foreign and domestic intelligence-gatheringoperations, along the lines of the FBI and CIA.   He declined to disclose the KGB budget or the number of agentsit employs, citing similar secrecy on the part of U.S.intelligence.   The Supreme Soviet parliament is drafting a law that wouldgovern the actions of the KGB and give a legislative commission theright to learn all the agency's secrets, similar to the SelectIntelligence Committees in the U.S. Congress, he said.   Already, he said, the Ministry of Finance has a specialdepartment that monitors the agency's expenditures.</TEXT></DOC>
