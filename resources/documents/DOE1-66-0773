<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-66-0773 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Themis model, a two dimensional code for basin analysis, integratesvarious physical and geochemical phenomena occurring in the evolutionof a sedimentary basin (compaction, fluid flow, heat transfer, formationand migration of hydrocarbons). The migration is assumed to occur asa diphasic fluid flow governed by Darcy's law in which relative permeabilitiesdescribe the influence of hydrocarbon saturation. This formulation, coupledwith the description of compaction and hydraulic fracturing, is shownto describe as well the expulsion from source rocks, the secondary migrationand the entrapment of hydrocarbons. The validity and the limitationsof this approach are discussed. Some case studies illustrate applicationsof the model.</TEXT></DOC>
