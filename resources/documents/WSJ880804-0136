Cohen (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> SCR FIN </IN><G> SEC </G><TEXT>   Lawyers for George C. Kern Jr. attacked as &quot;groundless&quot; and &quot;gratuitous&quot; the Securities and Exchange Commission's charges against the leading Wall Street takeover attorney.    In their first comment since an administrative hearing was completed last February, the attorneys denied that Mr. Kern, a senior partner at the New York law firm of Sullivan andamp; Cromwell, had violated disclosure laws. They said in a 113-page brief, filed with the SEC late Monday, that Mr. Kern had shown &quot;a reasonable exercise of professional judgment&quot; in a 1986 takeover battle.    In June 1987, the SEC's Division of Enforcement began administrative proceedings against Mr. Kern, charging that the lawyer erred in failing to promptly disseminate material information during Allied Stores Corp.'s unsuccessful efforts to fend off a hostile takeover by Campeau Corp. At the time, Mr. Kern was Allied's lead counsel and a director of the company.    The case against Mr. Kern is being closely monitored by Wall Street takeover lawyers and investment bankers, who believe that an SEC victory could result in greater public disclosure of preliminary merger talks between companies. They also fear that the SEC's case raises the threat that takeover lawyers and their firms would be held accountable for securities-law violations by their clients.    Marvin Schwartz, a senior partner at Sullivan andamp; Cromwell who is helping to defend Mr. Kern, said that the SEC's charges against Mr. Kern have &quot;a chilling effect upon lawyer independence.&quot; He added that &quot;a lawyer should not be made to fear that if the (SEC) disagrees in hindsight with the advice he has given his client, the lawyer faces the risk of punishment by the SEC.&quot;    &quot;This proceeding was authorized by&quot; the full commission of the SEC, said Thomas Newkirk, chief litigation counsel of the SEC's enforcement division. The commission, he said, &quot;thinks this was a serious matter.&quot;    At issue in the case against Mr. Kern is whether he should have disclosed merger talks with, and a prospective sale of six shopping centers to, Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. The SEC has said that both moves were &quot;material developments&quot; and should have been disclosed.    Allied, too, had been charged with violating disclosure rules. But last year, without admitting or denying guilt, the company agreed to comply with SEC disclosure requirements.    Mr. Kern's lawyers argued in their brief that the negotiations with DeBartolo Corp. never advanced to the stage where Mr. Kern or Allied believed they could reach an agreement. Citing testimony from both Daniel Good, a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. investment banker, and Paul Bilzerian, the Florida investor who is an associate of Mr. DeBartolo, the lawyers said that Mr. Kern had reason to doubt whether DeBartolo Corp. could finance a deal with Allied.    Mr. Kern and his attorneys have argued that the preliminary negotiations with DeBartolo Corp. were covered by a disclosure made by Allied after Campeau began a hostile tender offer for the company. At the time, Allied disclosed that it had authorized its advisers to pursue a number of alternatives, including a merger with another party or the sale of its assets.    Last March, in a shareholder class action brought against Basic Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court, by a 6-0 vote, ruled that under federal securities law and Securities and Exchange Commission rules, the existence of early merger negotiations may sometimes be &quot;material.&quot; The court said the question of when merger talks are material and thus disclosable must be decided on a case-by-case basis.    Mr. Kern's attorneys argued in their brief that the Supreme Court in the Basic case said that disclosure would be required if there is &quot;probability that the event will occur.&quot; They said that under that test, Mr. Kern was correct in determining that because there was little probability of an agreement between DeBartolo and Allied, there was no need for further disclosure.    In its case against Mr. Kern, the SEC is seeking a simple order requiring that Mr. Kern comply with its rules in the future, rather than a fine or other remedy. But Sullivan andamp; Cromwell has vowed to fight the SEC's charges &quot;as a matter of principle.&quot; An administrative law judge is expected to issue a decision in the case later this year or early next year. Any decision is likely to be appealed to the full SEC. </TEXT></DOC>
