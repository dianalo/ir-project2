Of America Told To Reduce Assets </HL><SO> </SO><CO> FIN GOVMT AHM GWF CAL GDW CSA HFD GTA CCI </CO><IN> BNK TNM </IN><DATELINE> IRVINE, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Financial Corp. of America, parent of troubled American Savings andamp; Loan Association, said it will reduce its holdings of mortgage-backed securities by $2.5 billion, or about 14%.    Financial Corp. said it was &quot;directed&quot; by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to reduce its $18.24 billion portfolio of mortgage-backed securities. The sales will reduce Financial Corp.'s total assets 7.4% to about $31.4 billion.    A Financial Corp. spokeswoman said the sales will take place &quot;in the near future, if possible.&quot; The company will try to time the sales &quot;to maximize value&quot; and to avoid &quot;disrupting the market&quot; for mortgage-backed securities, she said.    The demand to shrink assets represents a change in the Bank Board's strategy of handling Financial Corp. Under former Chairman Edwin J. Gray, who left office last July 1, the Bank Board endorsed Financial Corp.'s plan to expand its mortgage-backed securities portfolio as a way of generating revenue.    A Bank Board spokesman said the direction to shrink Financial Corp.'s assets was issued by Bank Board member Roger F. Martin, who is leading the board's efforts to resolve Financial Corp.'s woes.    Mr. Martin, who was in California yesterday meeting with executives of other thrifts to see if they are interested in buying some of American Savings' 185 branches, couldn't be reached for comment.    Cutting Financial Corp.'s securities portfolio could allow it to reduce its collateralized borrowings from Wall Street firms, which stood at $13.88 billion as of Dec. 31. As previously reported, Financial Corp. and its Wall Street lenders are anxiously awaiting a decision on whether the Federal Home Loan Bank Board will renew a letter promising support for Financial Corp. That letter expires March 31.    Financial Corp. declined to comment on whether it will reduce its collateralized borrowings from Wall Street firms.    Financial Corp. should be able to take profits, or at least avoid losses on the sales of mortgage-backed securities. The bond market rally following the October stock market crash has sharply reduced earlier paper losses in its portfolio.    The Bank Board hasn't disclosed which thrift concerns it invited to the meeting about buying branches from American Savings, which has about $15 billion in retail deposits. However, thrift industry sources said the following companies were included: H.F. Ahmanson andamp; Co., Los Angeles; Great Western Financial Corp., Beverly Hills; CalFed Inc., Los Angeles; Golden West Financial Corp., Oakland; Coast Savings andamp; Loan Association, Los Angeles; Home Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, San Diego; Great American First Savings Bank, San Diego; and Citicorp Savings, a unit of New York-based Citicorp. All the companies declined to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
