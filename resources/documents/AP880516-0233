The fears have prompted the government to increase defensespending to a record $10 billion this year and to reopen debate onthe development of nuclear weapons.   ``We can't just keep escalating expenditures to meet thechallenge,'' said Air Commodore Jasjit Singh, director of thegovernment-funded Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses in NewDelhi. ``I don't want to see a nuclear India. But the mostcost-effective solution is to go nuclear.''   India tested a nuclear device in 1974 but insisted it was forpeaceful purposes.   The concerns about shifts in the strategic balance have beenreflected in recent headlines in Indian newspapers:   _``Sino-Pakistan-Saudi Ties Threat to India.''   _``The Afghan Accord _ Dangerous Implications.''   _``Pakistan Arms Hurt Peace Process.''   India traditionally has kept a wary eye on Pakistan, itsneighbor on the subcontinent.   The two countries have fought three wars since theirindependence from Britain in 1947, and their troops still clashintermittently along the disputed border in India's northernKashmir state. India also has clashed with China over disputedborders.   But Pakistan is the chief concern because of repeated reports itis close to developing a nuclear weapon and because of U.S. plansto give the Pakistanis $1.7 billion in military aid over the nextsix years.   Indian officials and the press also speculate that with theSoviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan, Pakistan now will beable to turn more attention toward India.   At the same time, the Indians worry about weapons shifts inChina to the north and Saudi Arabia to the west.   China has been moving nuclear missiles into Tibet, according toWestern press reports and Indian military experts. It also has beenbeefing up its army garrisons to tighten control over the formerBuddhist kingdom.   Singh, the analyst, said he does not believe the Chinese movesare aimed directly at India but added that in the long run ``theyconstitute a larger level of threat against South Asia.''   To the west, Saudi Arabia has taken delivery of an undisclosednumber of Chinese-made East Wind surface-to-surface missiles with arange of almost 2,000 miles, making them capable of reaching India.   The Saudi missiles are seen as a deterrent to Iran in thePersian Gulf, but Narendra Gupta, an Indian weapons expert, wrotein a recent article in the independent Times of India newspaper:``The same missile system would on the one hand deter Iran forSaudi Arabia and, on the other, it would be a threat to India onbehalf of Pakistan.''   One fallout of end of hostilities in Afghanistan, said theleft-leaning weekly Democratic World of New Delhi, is that arms nolonger needed by the Afghan rebels could find their way to bothPakistani and Indian insurgents, such as the Sikhs extremists inPunjab.   ``The other fallout ... could be that Pakistan, relieved of itsanxiety on its western borders, could move its contingents to itseastern borders'' next to India, the magazine said.   India has a larger military force than Pakistan _ an army with1.1 million personnel compared to 450,000 in Pakistan, for example.But it has China on one side and Pakistan on the other, and itsforces must be used to guard against both.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs May 23</NOTE></DOC>
