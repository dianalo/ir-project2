The expression for thespatial density of models near the equatorial plane is found. It includesthe square of the curcular frequency as a factor. the general expressionconnecting the surface density and the potential for an arbitrary flatenessis obtained. The extreme case when the model consists of a halo and ofinfinitesimally thin disk is investigated. It is shown that the surfacedensity of the disk is proportional to the square of the circular frequency.Equidensity surfaces of the halo are found to coincide with the equipotentialones, so the Poisson equation for the halo is just the one for sphericalsystems. Some examples of its solution are given.</TEXT></DOC>
