(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A bombing and an attack on a nonunionmine early today marred the start of a cooling-off period called bythe head of the United Mine Workers union in an effort to easetensions in a wildcat walkout.   About 150 people, some wearing masks and camouflage paint ontheir faces, appeared at the entrance to the Appalachian Mining Inc.mine at Boomer, southeast of Charleston, overturning two trucks anda car and injuring several security personnel, said Cliff Nuckols.   ``They sneaked through the weeds. You can't see them. They comethrough the weeds and the woods and all of a sudden you're justlooking at them,'' said Nuckols, head of Cincinnati-based Nuckolsand Associates Security Inc., which handles security at the mine.   He said shots were fired from a picket line outside the mine.Security personnel fired no shots. Nuckols said the workers'injuries were minor. He said he didn't know who the attackers were.   At Castlewood, Va., two bombs exploded early today, one damaginga Pittston Coal Group Inc. office trailer and another going off on aprivate yard, state police reported. No injuries were caused and noone was arrested, Virginia state police Sgt. Mike Frank said.   A woman who answered the phone at UMW District 17 headquarters inCharleston said union officials were unavailable for comment thismorning.   More than 37,000 miners have been on industry-wide wildcatwalkouts since June 12 in eight states, protesting Pittston'srefusal to sign a national contract negotiated by the UMW and othercompanies that are members of the Bituminous Coal OperatorsAssociation.   Pittston's miners, without a contract since Feb. 1, 1988, havebeen on strike since April 5.   Miners say the wildcat strikes are being staged because Pittstonis not dealing fairly with the union. Pittston officials have deniedthat.   The violence came three days after UMW President Richard Trumkacalled for all UMW members east of the Mississippi River to stayaway from work for a three-day memorial period in an attempt to``calm the volatile situation in the coal fields.''   Trumka was to join U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., and GaryWhite, head of the West Virginia Coal Operators Association, in NewYork today for talks with the head of Japan's Nippon Steel. Nipponis the world's largest steelmaker and uses West Virginia coal.   In an interview with the (Charleston) Sunday Gazette-Mail, Trumkasaid he sees no quick solution for the Pittston strike, which hasidled 1,900 miners in West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky.   Trumka also told the newspaper he wouldn't be surprised if he'sjailed for his part in the labor action.   Three union leaders were jailed for a time in Virginia forencouraging miners and their supporters to block Pittston's coalproduction through acts of civil disobedience.   Trumka said court orders for the UMW to end sit-downdemonstrations against Pittston _ and fines that double every timethe union is found in violation _ are an ``economic death warrant.''</TEXT></DOC>
