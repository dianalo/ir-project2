The assessment, initiatedin 1975, focuses on the ecology of the Chesapeake Bay because aqueousreleases represent the greatest radioecological impact pathway. Collectionsof sediment, finfish, shellfish, miscellaneous invertebrates, algae,and waterfowl were analyzed by high-resolution gamma spectroscopy todetermine gamma-emitting radionuclide concentrations. Analysis resultsand interpretation of studies conducted during 1978-1980 are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
