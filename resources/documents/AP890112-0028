But the United States and Soviet Union, the only two countriesthat admit they possess chemical arms, said Wednesday that thedocument produced by the five-day conference had fallen short oftheir expectations.   The chief U.S. delegate, William F. Burns, said Washington wouldhave preferred that explicit language be put into the declaration toinclude sanctions against users of poison gas, nerve gas and othertoxic chemical arms.   ``If the United States had written this statement, which we didnot, it might have been stronger. This is a consensus document,''said Burns, who heads the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.   Iran, a victim of poison gas in its eight-year war with Iraq, wasamong several states that voiced reservations after thedeclaration's unanimous endorsement.   Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Iran and Iraq's Kurdishminority _ graphic pictures of peasants killed in Iranian villagesheightened concerns last year _ provided a somber backdrop for theconference, which was formally proposed by President Reagan at theUnited Nations in September.   Iran succeeded in getting a reference to ``recent violations'' ofthe protocol in the declaration. But its delegation said it hadhoped for a categorical condemnation of past use of toxic weapons.   Host France said the conference would give life to languishingnegotiations in Geneva seeking a verifiable ban on chemical arms.   The non-binding declaration reaffirms the 1925 Geneva Protocol,which prohibits the use of chemical weapons, and urges negotiatorsin Geneva to ``redouble'' efforts to ban the use, production andstocking of chemical arms.   The six-point declaration affirms the U.N. role in investigatingchemical weapons use and called for a strenthening of existingprocedures at the United Nations in dealing with such use _ areference to enacting sanctions.   Signers condemned the use of chemical arms, pledging not to usethem.   Unanimous approval of the final declaration was ``tantamount tosaying the whole international community has taken a posture''against chemical weapons, said Foreign Minister Roland Dumas ofFrance, who presided over the conference.   ``This unanimity will accelerate ... work underway in Geneva,''he said.   But the breadth of the declaration, aimed at appeasing allparties, allowed for a broad interpretation that clearly reflectedfive days of haggling.   Max Friedersdorf, U.S. arms negotiator in Geneva, said it was``hard to quantify'' how the declaration could speed up negotiationstoward a convention. ``I think it will have an impact on nations.It's bound to strengthen world opinion on the convention,''Friedersdorf said.   ``Until the end of events recently ... there was very littlenotice given to what was going on in Geneva. In fact I think thewhole world thought the dreaded scourge of chemical weapons was goneforever, since World War I.''   The United States and other Western nations that have nucleararms succeeded in blocking efforts led by Arab states to explicitlylink the banning of chemical and nuclear weapons.   Arab nations said they wanted to reserve the right to possesschemical weapons to counter what they claim is a nuclear threat fromIsrael.   However, hours before the conference closed, Iraqi Vice PremierTariq Aziz announced that Arab states would concede their demand tolink nuclear and chemical weapons bans in order to get a consensus.   Forty delegations have been holding talks in Geneva on banningchemical weapons since the early 1980s, but have been stymied byways to verify a ban on chemical and biological weapons, whichinclude odorless, colorless gases made in plants that can becamoflaged on short notice and laboratory-made toxins derived fromfungi.   An estimated 20 nations currently have chemical weaponscapabilities.</TEXT></DOC>
