The carbon mass balance of the solid, liquid andgaseous reaction products was produced at temperatures of 250/sup 0/Cto 330/sup 0/C and at a pressure of 1 bar. Velocity constants and activationenergies were calculated on the basis of these measurements. The resultsof these measurements suggested a reaction of at least three stages.For an even further increase of the reaction temperatures, tests werecarried out under pressure at temperatures of up to 380/sup 0/c. At atemperature of 380/sup 0/C and a pressure of 3,3 bar, a carbon turnoverof 90% could be achieved within a reaction time of 20 min. Using thesevalues, a power density of 1.27 MW/m/sup 3/ sulphuric acid was calculated,which amounts to a sulphuric acid volume of 315 m/sup 3/ for a 400 MWreactor. The sulphur content of the residual coal increased with timein comparison to the initial content, but the SO/sub 2/ pollution ofthe environment remained below the value determined by the IndustrialFurnaces Ordinance.
