The measure would prevent the current ban, which covers four outof five domestic U.S. flights, from expiring as scheduled in April.   In a victory for the cigarette industry, however, anti-smokingforces were blocked from adding language that would have spread theprohibition to all domestic flights.   ``This is probably the most popular bill we've passed aroundhere in two years,'' said Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., sponsor ofboth the existing and the new restrictions.   The extended prohibition was contained in an $11.9 billiontransportation bill for fiscal 1990 that the House passed 366-50.The measure will next be considered by the Senate, where an effortis expected to broaden the smoking restrictions.   The key fight on the smoking question occurred Wednesday, whenlawmakers adopted the ban on a 259-169 vote. That vote was aprocedural one that included other issues, but the cigaretterestrictions dominated the day's debate.   When Congress enacted the initial ban two years ago, the tobaccoindustry actively fought the proposal with claims that growerswould lose business and assertions that smoking was a health hazardwere unproven. The House approved the ban in 1987 by a slim 198-193margin.   This year, after early votes by House committees indicated thatlawmakers were not receptive to completely killing therestrictions, the tobacco lobby decided it could live with apermanent extension of the ban on two-hour flights. The industryreasoned that making the restriction permanent would eliminateopportunities for the ban to be expanded every time it expired.   ``They counted noses,'' Durbin said of the tobacco industry'stactics.   Asked about the cigarette lobby's decision to do little to blockthe permanent extension of the ban, Rep. Walter Jones, D-N.C.,whose district relies heavily on tobacco growing, said Wednesday,``This is the best compromise we can get.''   The bill limits spending to $12 million for the program thatpays subsidies to airlines serving small communities. About $31million is being spent this year on the program, a tiny portion ofthe transportation budget that big-city lawmakers say is largely awaste of money.   The measure also provides $7.3 billion for the Federal AviationAdministration, $960 million more than this year; $2.9 billion forthe Coast Guard, about $100 million more than 1989; $3.2 billionfor mass transit, and $615 million for Amtrak, which got $584million this year.   The bill provides $11.9 billion in new spending, but also allowsan additional $15.3 billion to be spent from revenues from varioususer fees.</TEXT></DOC>
