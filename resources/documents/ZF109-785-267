The answer is that a new approachis needed, built around multi-database or federated systems, whichallow database interoperability without a globally integratedschema.andP;  In federated or multi-database systems, databasesmaintain autonomy while allowing shared access.andP;  Commerciallyavailable relational database management systems are evolving intofederated systems.andP;  Some prototypes of federated systems arediscussed.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     TechnologyAccess MethodsData Base DesignTheory of ComputationAlgorithmsData Base LanguagesDistributed data bases.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Multi-database architecture.
