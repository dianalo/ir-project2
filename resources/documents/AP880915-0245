To which you might respond: So what else is new?   Agreed, the small-business view does not break new ground, but astudy just completed draws dire consequences from it, particularlythe inference that the dispensing of services in America may bedeclining.   The study, by the NFIB Foundation, found that just 60 percent ofall small-business loan applicants left their banks satisfied, afinding the foundation felt was so important it led to its majorconclusion.   William Dennis, Jr., senior research fellow, explains thatconclusion:   ``Not long ago, the United States lost preeminence inmanufacturing due to the decline in product quality. Since thattime American industry has struggled mightily _ sometimessuccessfully and sometimes not _ to regain lost markets.   ``The 60 percent figures raises the specter that the sameprocess may be occurring in services.''   This conclusion is made despite what some bankers claim is anexplosion of new and valuable products from lending institutions inthe aftermath of deregulation. But the survey concludes differently.   According to John Sloan, president of the National Federation ofIndependent Business and a former banker, the results ofderegulation ``are virtually invisible.''   Although the study, which involved more than 1,900 businesses,found some evidence of greater competition for small-businessaccounts, Sloan states that ``small-business owners have not onlyseen little in the way of improved services or benefits, they haveactually been hit with higher interest rates.''   The Washington-based federation has more than 500,000 businessmembers, some with sales in the scores of millions of dollars, adimension that hardly qualifies them as ``small.''   Just what is ``small'' has always been a subject of dispute,with some analysts limiting it mainly to proprietorships, whileothers define the category so broadly as to include any businessother than the 1,000 largest.   Stating that small business is enormous by any measure, Dennisoffers these statistics:   _More than 17 million federal income tax returns containing sometype of business income were filed in 1986, and more than 4 millionbusinesses employed people.   _Approximately 99 percent of all businesses are classified assmall. ``In fact, most small businesses are very small. Nearly 60percent of all employers have only one to four employees. Ninetypercent have less than 20.''   _Small business produces about 38 percent of the gross nationalproduct, and nearly half of the nation's gross business product,constituting more than $1.5 trillion of goods and services everyyear.   _Small companies have created most of the 34 million new jobs inthe United States since 1970. ``Smaller firms now employ over halfthe private sector workforce.''   Small business, in short, is a vital economic force _ one of theworld's largest. By some estimates, says Dennis, it is the world'sthird largest economy, trailing only the United States as a wholeand the Soviet Union.   And yet, the study suggests, it is not being serviced properlyby banks.   An example:   Diversity within the small-business population implies thatsmall-business financial conditions and demands for financing mustalso be highly diverse.   But, Dennis observes, ``with lending authority often physicallyremoved from a small-business owner's branch, and transaction costsfor custom loans comparatively high, `cookie cutter banking'appears increasingly in vogue.''   Almost all transactions, he continues, are cut from the samepattern, the result of tension between ``the small business needfor individualized borrowing and the banks' demand for greateruniformity in lending.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thurs Sept 15</NOTE></DOC>
