Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> NASHVILLE, Tenn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Listening to Pat Robertson sometimes is a little like plugging into a data base quietly gone berserk.    In a campaign stop here that lasted just a few hours the other day, he described:   --How King William III of England was snookered into letting a Scotsman, William Paterson, &quot;invent a practical money machine&quot; by setting up the Bank of England in 1694. Central banks, he said, have been charging interest on money they &quot;create out of nothing&quot; ever since.    --How U.S. companies are snookered by Asian competitors. &quot;When an American firm brings out a computer program or a computer system,&quot; he said, &quot;the time it takes to be carried back to Asia, copied, manufactured and brought back for sale in America is all of three weeks.&quot;    --How the State Department has been infiltrated by members of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. &quot;We won't have these people from the eastern liberal establishment in my administration,&quot; he vowed. The Council on Foreign Relations, he has said, believes &quot;nationhood per se is obsolete.&quot;    He says all kinds of things all the time. Some of it is accurate enough -- William Paterson really did found the Bank of England -- but some of it is flat wrong. He says, for example, that &quot;over 100,000 people in government serve at the pleasure of the president,&quot; including Jimmy Carter holdovers. And he says he has been told preschool kids in Bakersfield, Calif., are taking drugs.    Mr. Robertson founded his Christian Broadcasting Network in 1959. In the years since, on his &quot;700 Club&quot; show, he has discussed hundreds of subjects with thousands of people in millions of words. He has written five books, delivered countless speeches. The record rivals the National Archives.    There is no doubt that Mr. Robertson -- Republican presidential candidate, born-again, charismatic preacher and Yale Law School graduate -- is smart. He once told former Rep. Pete McCloskey his IQ is 159. Later, he told this newspaper it's 137.    He stores much of what he has heard or read, and frequently unloads bits and pieces in his campaign speeches. Most of the time, his own staff can't say where the information comes from. It is not unlike President Reagan, who has filed away little scraps of information for years, too (the legendary Chicago &quot;welfare queen,&quot; for example, who had 80 names, 30 addresses and 12 Social Security cards).    Mr. Robertson frequently recalls the story about preschoolers using drugs in Bakersfield; another scrap involves a survey one of his organizations took of students at the University of Maryland. He talked about that Jan. 8 in the Republican debate in Des Moines. &quot;We asked one student, 'Could you tell us what three countries the United States fought in World War II?' They said yes. 'We fought Korea. We fought Pearl Harbor and we fought the Spanish.'&quot; The story, he said, demonstrates a serious flaw in the nation's educational system.    Asked about it later, John S. Toll, the University of Maryland's president, said he thought it only demonstrated that Maryland students have a sense of humor.    For months, Mr. Robertson insisted that &quot;over 100,000 people in government serve at the pleasure of the president.&quot; He added, &quot;I'm told that a good portion of them are Jimmy Carter appointees and holdovers.&quot; He said the first thing he would do as president would be to ask for the resignations of all of them. In fact, the White House says, there are 3,100 full-time people serving at the president's pleasure and hardly any worked for Mr. Carter. In recent speeches, Mr. Robertson has made the correction himself.    And as for the story about preschoolers taking drugs, Lt. Mike Sorrell, spokesman for the police department in Bakersfield, says, &quot;We don't have any information that anything like that is true.&quot; Mr. Robertson's spokesperson says an unidentified Bakersfield policeman told Mr. Robertson about the drug use when he visited the city last year.    Mr. Robertson regularly lambastes the government for wasting the taxpayers' money. He told the Daily Oklahoman, in Oklahoma City, for example, that 50% to 60% of federal money intended to help the poor is eaten up by overhead.    Randy Teach, deputy assistant secretary at the Health and Human Services Department, says overhead costs for the Medicaid program, providing health care for the poor, run to 5% annually. Administrative costs to run the other major program for the poor -- Aid to Families with Dependent Children -- are about 11%, he says.    Other regular targets are the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations. Mr. Robertson says he would clear the State Department of &quot;people who were placed there by the Trilateral Commission.&quot;    The commission was founded in 1973 by banker David Rockefeller to analyze major issues facing North America, Western Europe and Japan. &quot;We certainly don't run a placement bureau,&quot; says Charles Heck, the North American director. He says the only member in the State Department now is Deputy Secretary John Whitehead.    As for the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr. Robertson has said it believes that &quot;nationhood per se is obsolete.&quot; Jonathan Zemmol, the public-affairs director, says the council is nonpartisan in nature and has never published an article or a book &quot;promoting a one-world government.&quot; He notes Mr. Robertson spoke at the council's New York headquarters March 10 last year. His topic: &quot;Toward a Democratic United Nations.&quot;    Another popular target is the New York City school system. Mr. Robertson says 40% to 50% of schoolchildren there drop out before they graduate. A school spokesman puts the drop-out rate in 1985-86 at 30.7%, down from 41.7% in 1982-83.    Mr. Robertson's biggest target is abortion. He has accused the Democratic &quot;family&quot; -- &quot;Tip O'Neill as our daddy, Bella Abzug as our big sister and Teddy Kennedy as our younger brother&quot; -- of slaughtering 1.5 million of its unborn every year. He says that by the year 2020, 40 million legal abortions will have been performed in this country -- &quot;worse than what happened in Nazi Germany,&quot; he told the Burlington (Vt.) Free Press. &quot;The hands, hearts and arms of these children killed would have produced $1.4 trillion in our GNP by 2020.&quot;    William W. Hamilton Jr., director of Planned Parenthood's Washington office, says Mr. Robertson is making projections when &quot;you can't tell what's going to happen 10 years out.&quot; He says the number of legal abortions being performed has been dropping year by year.
