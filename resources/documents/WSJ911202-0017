With a $350 billion budget deficit,a crippled banking system and a nation awash in debt, mosttraditional measures for combating slumps would onlyexacerbate the economy's long-run problems.   It is those problems that present the real threat toAmericans' well-being. Recessions aside, the U.S. economysince about 1973 has been suffering from a slowlydebilitating disease. Growth in productivity has dropped, thecompetitiveness of industry has declined, the once-steadyrise in living standards has faltered, and wages havestagnated. Most Americans tell pollsters that they doubttheir children's generation will live as well as they do. TheAmerican dream is fading.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Bush might better weather the current crisis if he hada strategy for dealing with long-term problems. Like RonaldReagan, he could chant: &quot;Stay the course.&quot; As it is, there isno course.                                                                                                          A reminder of the administration's failure to addresslong-term problems came recently with the publication of&quot;Short-Term America,&quot; a book written by Michael Jacobs andpublished by the Harvard Business School Press. Mr. Jacobscame to Washington in 1989 at the behest of TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady to serve in a new Treasury post,director of corporate finance. His charge: to look at theways that U.S. capital markets force companies to focus onshort-term results, at the expense of long-termcompetitiveness.                                                                                                          In a speech in Columbus, Ohio, in December 1988, Mr. Bradysaid that finding ways to get businessmen to focus on thelong term was his &quot;No. 1 goal&quot; as Treasury secretary. Later,talking to The Wall Street Journal, he said: &quot;What do I thinkabout when I'm in the shower? It's what can we do to makebusinesses have longer time horizons.&quot;   In the past three years, however, Mr. Brady either hastaken precious few showers, or his thinking has changed. TheBrady Treasury -- caught up dealing with the savings and loanproblem, the banking problem and the budget problem -- hasdone remarkably little to address the secretary's &quot;No. 1goal.&quot;   Mr. Jacobs and J. French Hill, who recently left his jobas a deputy assistant Treasury secretary to take a WhiteHouse post, spent two years preparing an elaborate series ofpapers examining how U.S. capital markets force businesses toconcentrate excessively on the short term. They also madespecific recommendations on how to cure the short-termdisease. But despite all their work, Secretary Brady nevereven met with Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Hill on the subject.Frustrated, Mr. Jacobs finally quit the Treasury and wrotehis book.   Mr. Jacobs argues that the short-term obsession ofAmerican companies -- &quot;business myopia,&quot; he calls it -- growsout of a widening split between the people who financeAmerican businesses and those who run them. In Germany andJapan, he notes, the providers of capital, particularly bigbanks, are actively involved in the management of companiesand are therefore committed to their long-run viability. Inthe U.S., shareholders and bondholders feel no suchobligation, buying and selling securities like commoditiesand playing little role in management.   The result: American companies must pander to theshort-term demands of securities traders.                                                                                                          Why did Mr. Brady ignore these ideas? The most likelyanswer, according to those familiar with the Treasury'soperations, is this: The Treasury secretary became a victimof the very disease he was trying to cure. Under constantpressure to deal with the crises of the moment, he neverfound time to address long-term problems. (For their part,Treasury officials argue that their efforts to cut the budgetdeficit and reform the savings and loan and bankingindustries will all help the nation's long-term economicperformance.)                                                                                                          Several of Mr. Bush's potential Democratic opponents forthe presidency have spent some time thinking about thenation's long-term economic problems. Mr. Jacobs's bookdemonstrates that there are good Republican alternatives tothose Democrats' ideas, and they rely more on the marketplacethan government decision-making.   Mr. Jacobs suggests changing securities regulations toincrease the ability of large institutional investors, suchas pension funds, to appoint corporate directors. If suchinvestors had more of a voice in running the company, heargues, they would be less inclined to sell their shares tothe first takeover artist that comes along. He also proposesmeasures to tie executive pay more closely to long-termperformance.   Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter isworking on an even more comprehensive set of recommendationsto encourage businesses to focus on the long term, includingnew incentives to encourage companies to invest in researchand development, and creation of government-sponsoredresearch institutes that would help get technology out ofgovernment and university laboratories and into corporations.But like Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Porter says he has &quot;been pushing ashard as I can&quot; to persuade his friends in the Bushadministration to look into these issues, with littlesuccess.   This recession will pass. But the economy's underlyingproblems have been two decades in the making and won't beeasy to solve. Next year would be a good time for bothparties to address them seriously.</TEXT></DOC>
