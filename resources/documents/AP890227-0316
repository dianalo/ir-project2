The sides are said to be still haggling over whether theinvestment firm must move part of its high-profile and big-money``junk bond'' financing division run by trader Michael Milken fromBeverly Hills, Calif., to New York.   But Drexel has agreed to tighten internal controls to preventfuture securities law violations, hire a consultant to monitor thechanges and increase the size of its board, sources familiar withthe negotiations said.   Drexel already has agreed to plead guilty to six felony countsand pay a record $650 million to settle criminal securities fraudcharges with the Justice Department.   But the plea deal cannot proceed until the firm resolves civilclaims brought last September by the Securities and ExchangeCommission, the federal regulatory agency that polices U.S.financial markets.   The SEC accused Drexel and four officials, including Milken, ofinsider trading, defrauding clients, securities fraud, stockmanipulation and other violations in September.   Drexel and the SEC have been negotiating regularly sinceDecember, when the U.S. attorney's office in New York announced thecriminal plea bargain that followed a massive two-year probe basedon information supplied by imprisoned speculator Ivan Boesky.   The SEC settlement, which sources said should be completed withintwo weeks, must be approved by a federal court judge.   Drexel then would enter a guilty plea to the felony counts andimmediately fork over $300 million in fines to the government.Another $350 million would be placed in an account to coverpotential lawsuits by investors.   One source close to the negotiations, who asked not to beidentified, said the sides were working on language and details ofthe agreement although the status of Drexel's West Coast divisionremained unresolved.   The parties now apparently have agreed that Drexel will move aportion of the California business _ either its equity trading orconvertible securities operations _ back to New York, where thenation's fifth-largest securities firm is based, the source said.   Drexel opposed shifting the entire California operation, as theSEC originally demanded. The operation has more than 500 employeesand accounts for much of the firm's profits, and Drexel argued thata relocation would cripple the company and severely hurt West Coastfinancial markets.   The firm reportedly has agreed to install an internal rulescompliance system that will include tighter oversight of alloperations, and add two to four people from outside the company toits 22-member board.   The future of high-yield bond trader Milken, who organized themultibillion-dollar California operations in the late 1970s, has notplayed a role in the SEC settlement negotiations, one source said.   But Milken and potenial lawsuits against Drexel could ensure thatthe landmark securities fraud case _ which the company says has costit more than $175 million, including $30 million for photocopyinglegal documents _ will continue long after the SEC settlement issigned and delivered.   The government this week was expected to reply in court papers toa motion from Milken challenging the criminal settlement, whichrequires Drexel to terminate Milken and withhold hismultimillion-dollar pay.   Even if his motion fails, Milken, who is expected to be indictedsoon on fraud and racketeering charges but so far has not beencharged in connection with the case, could sue Drexel to get his1988 pay, which his attorneys said would ``greatly exceed'' $100million.   Drexel reportedly is setting aside the amount of Milken'scompensation, most of which is a bonus linked to performance, incase it later must pay him. Milken has charged the settlementviolates his rights.   Drexel also has established legal teams in several states andmade contacts in others anticipating a barrage of lawsuits by stateand local securities regulators and investors connected with dealsnamed in the charges against Drexel.   In addition, Drexel will announce in about three weeks whether itis hiring former SEC Chairman John Shad, now the U.S. ambassador tothe Netherlands, as its new chairman, sources said. Earlier thisyear Shad confirmed he was considering a Drexel offer.</TEXT></DOC>
