On other markets, gasoline futures soared and other energyfutures also gained; livestock and meat were mixed; precious metalsadvanced; and stock-index futures gained.   ``I'm astounded,'' Katharina Zimmer, New York-based grainsanalyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc., said after thegrain and soybean markets closed.   Most corn, soybean and oat contracts plunged their respective15-, 30- and 10-cent limits for daily trading, and the limitlesscontracts for July delivery fell even further. Wheat contracts forDecember, March and July 1989 delivery tumbled 20 cents a bushel,the limit in that market.   Despite new forecasts for weekend rains in the dry and dustyMidwest, Ms. Zimmer said the sell-off was technically inspired.   ``This market has nothing to do with fundamentals any more,''she said. Instead, she said, Thursday's action was dominated byso-called technicians, who base their trading decisions onhistorical chart patterns.   On Thursday, the charts indicated it was time to sell, Ms.Zimmer said.   More likely, the drop was caused by a combination of technicaland fundamental factors, said Ted Mao, grain specialist withShearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.   Though prices turned lower shortly after the opening, Mao saidthe sharpest drop followed midday news reports that Senate MinorityLeader Robert Dole, R-Kan., had said the Senate may considermeasures allowing farmers to plant soybeans and oats on a portionof their acreage idled under government crop programs.   But Dole, speaking to the Commodity Club in Washington, said theSenate probably would not act on the matter for at least anothermonth.   Private forecasts for moderate rainfall this weekend in thenorthern Corn Belt also pressured the markets, Mao said.   ``The market continues to show its sensitivity to prospects ofgetting even a little bit of rain,'' he said.   ``That's nonsense,'' countered Ms. Zimmer, who dismissed theexpected rain as ``sprinkles.''   ``To tell an Illinois farmer we're locked limit-down because ofthe rain we're going to get, I don't know what they'd say, but itprobably would not be printable,'' she said.   Wheat settled 15{ cents to 20 cents lower with the contract fordelivery in July at $3.78 a bushel; corn was 14{ cents to 22 centslower with July at $3.20 a bushel; oats were 10 cents to 22 centslower with July at $3.01 a bushel; soybeans were 26 cents to 49{cents lower with July at $9.34{ a bushel.   Prices for future delivery of unleaded gasoline and heating oilsoared on the New York Mercantile Exchange in reaction toWednesday's weekly American Petroleum Institute report showing asharp drawdown in gasoline supplies, analysts said.   Energy futures were broadly supported by reports that the tragicexplosion of a North Sea oil rig could cause production of NorthSea crude oil to fall by 30,000 barrels a day, said Nauman Barakat,energy analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   Crude-oil futures declined on profit-taking in the second halfof the session, he said.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 43 cents to 55 centshigher with August at $15.83 a barrel; heating oil was 1.37 centsto 1.68 cents higher with August at 44.29 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was 1.23 cents to 2.56 cents higher with August at 53.12cents a gallon.   The inflationary implications of higher energy prices supportedprecious metals futures on New York's Commodity Exchange, analystssaid.   Gold settled 40 cents to $1.20 higher with August at $441.10 atroy ounce; silver was 11.5 cents to 13.6 cents higher with July at$6.935 a troy ounce.   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange.   The drop in grain prices prompted reversals of recentdrought-related trends in the cattle and hog markets, and porkbellies rebounded sharply after touching 8-year lows on Wednesday,said Paul Hare, an analyst with Linnco Futures Inc. in Chicago.   Live cattle were .60 cent lower to .15 cent higher with Augustat 64.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .38 centhigher with August at 74.75 cents a pound; hogs were 1.50 centslower to .83 cent higher with July at 45.40 cents a pound; frozenpork bellies were .70 cent lower to 2 cents higher with July at34.40 cents a pound.   Stock-index futures finished higher on the Chicago MercantileExchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standardandamp; Poor's index settled 1.20 points higher at 273.20.</TEXT></DOC>
