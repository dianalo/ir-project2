In Illinois all teachers in amnesty programs must betrained in special workshops and experienced in teachingEnglish as a second language to adults. The teachers hiredare professionally trained people who respect the dignity andself-esteem of their students. I agree it is unrealistic toexpect our students to learn English in only 40 hours. We areattempting to help them gain some survival skills in Englishand a basic knowledge of American history and government.These skills, it is hoped, will enable them to improve theirlives and may even spark an interest in continued educationand in being &quot;politically active in their new homeland,&quot; asimmigration attorney Juan Jasso urged them. Our students areinterested and enthusiastic and many continue in our programlong after their 40 hours for legalization are completed.</LP><TEXT>   Katharine B.
