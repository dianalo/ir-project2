The $1 trillion plan, which is expected to be approved by Congress as early as next week, calls for a tax increase of $19.3 billion in fiscal 1988, which begins Oct. 1. It also would set military budget authority at $296 billion and military outlays at $289.5 billion that year, enough to keep pace with inflation but less than the president requested. If a tax increase isn't signed by the president, the military budget would be kept at close to current levels.    President Reagan issued a statement criticizing the $36.85 billion deficit-reduction package, and asserted the deficit can be reduced without boosting taxes. &quot;For every $1 of defense it will cost $10 in new taxes,&quot; the statement added. &quot;That's an offer I can refuse.&quot; Republicans, in the minority on the House-Senate conference, refused to assent to the document. The resolution, which doesn't require the president's signature, would serve as a framework for appropriations and tax-writing panels.    &quot;The House is going to do its job, with or without the cooperation of our minority,&quot; said House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas). &quot;However, key pieces of the nation's business cannot be enacted without the president . . . playing a positive and constructive role. Deficit reduction is the most obvious one.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
