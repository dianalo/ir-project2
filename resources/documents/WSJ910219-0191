Almost two years ago, a coup in Sudan led by Lt. Gen. OmarHassan al-Bashir inspired hope that the seven-year civil warbetween the Arab, Muslim north and the African, Christian andanimist south might end. But since Gen. Bashir's quickrejection in July 1989 of an earlier peace accord between therebel Sudan People's Liberation Army and the former, electedgovernment of Sadiq el-Mahdi, the Islamic Bashir regime haspursued all-out war.</LP><TEXT>   And so, for the third time in six years, famine threatensSudan. As many as 11 million people -- almost half thecountry's total -- are in danger. Dry weather causes the foodshortage, but a brutal military regime is turning theshortage into starvation.   Gen. Bashir's National Salvation Revolutionary CommandCouncil has virtually halted deliveries of food and medicineto the south, even to government-controlled towns, claimingthat relief efforts aid the rebels. Government-armed Arabmilitias are committing atrocities against civilians --stealing their cattle, killing old men and enslaving womenand children. In September, Gen. Bashir told applauding headsof state at the United Nations conference on children in NewYork that his government would make the welfare of children apriority. Just a week earlier, the government had bombedcivilians in four southern towns.   Even in the north, the government's campaign of terror isstaggering. The Command Council has imposed an indefinitestate of emergency on the country, suspended theconstitution, dissolved the Constituent Assembly and bannedall political parties and trade unions. According to AmnestyInternational, hundreds of union members, teachers, doctors,lawyers, judges and journalists have been arrested withoutcharge. Many have been tortured; others have been summarilyexecuted. One prominent doctor, Ali Fadul, died of headinjuries after being bludgeoned during questioning. Hiscorpse was missing an ear and a finger. The government'sexplanation for his death: cerebral malaria.   The government also denies the threat of famine, eventhough the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization hasestimated that the gap between needed and available grainwill soon be one million tons. Despite the looming famine,Sudan's government last year sent 300,000 tons of grain toLibya and Iraq in exchange for arms.   From 1975 until 1985, the U.S. provided Sudan with morethan $1.5 billion in aid, $267 million in 1985 alone.Forbidden by law from supplying aid to regimes that came topower by toppling democracies, the U.S. government has endedall but humanitarian assistance. Washington even temporarilydiverted 45,000 tons of food from Sudan to protest the Bashirgovernment's obstruction of relief efforts. The EuropeanCommunity has also suspended humanitarian aid.   Many Arab states have also given up. Furious over Gen.Bashir's support of Saddam Hussein, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait andthe United Arab Emirates have severed nearly all aid.Ironically, Saudi and Kuwaiti banks financed the Islamicfundamentalists who now dominate Sudan's military junta.Egypt, which depends on the flow of the Nile through Sudan,is also critical of the Bashir regime's expansion of the warand its embrace of Saddam. Even Moammar Gadhafi, a closesupporter, has chastised the Revolutionary Council for itspromotion of Islamic fundamentalism, which he perceives as athreat to his own pan-Arab ambitions.   Despite its economic and political isolation, the Bashirregime adamantly resists meaningful concessions to therebels. Instead, the Command Council has largely excludedsoutherners from government and expanded the use of &quot;sharia&quot;,or Islamic law -- with its floggings, amputations andcrucifixions -- on the country's religiously diversepopulation.   While Sudan's critics are completely justified indistancing themselves from the current regime, abandoningSudan will not save the millions in danger of starvation, orthe hundreds jailed for advocating political reforms. Andthere are signs that foreign pressure could force the Bashirgovernment to compromise.   When the U.S. diverted those 45,000 tons of grain, theBashir government agreed for a while to stop bombing civiliantargets and to resume some food shipments to the south.Despite the evacuation of nearly all U.S. embassy stafffollowing the start of the Gulf War, the U.S. does retainconsiderable leverage with its pledge to provide 330,000 tonsof grain. Just as the U.S. and Soviet Union prodded theEthiopian government and Eritrean rebels to allow food reliefinto stricken areas, the international community, includingEgypt and Saudi Arabia, could press for such an arrangementin Sudan.   If the Bashir regime rejects such overtures, as itsrenewed bombing of civilians in the south portends, theinternational community must take stronger steps. IfAmerica's troop commitment in the Gulf represents &quot;a newworld order&quot; in which Arab allies are to work more closelywith the U.S. to promote regional stability, Sudan would makea good testing ground.   America's Gulf allies could join in cutting off all oiland grain shipments to northern Sudan. Egypt could stopimporting Sudanese livestock, depriving the Bashir governmentof one of its few sources of foreign currency. Although Gen.Bashir has quelled four attempted coups since he took power,bread shortages in Khartoum, the capital, could seriouslychallenge the junta. At the same time, the U.S. could expandits shipments of food and medicine to civilians in the souththrough Kenya.   Saddam Hussein may be the region's &quot;Hitler&quot;; but unlessthe world acts soon, the genocide will be in Sudan.   ---   Mr. Choharis, a fellow at the Center for Area Studies atYale, was a field officer for UNICEF in Sudan, 1985-86.</TEXT></DOC>
