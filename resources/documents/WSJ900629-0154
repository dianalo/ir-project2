He was firstof all a pre-eminent physicist who won a high position in theSoviet establishment as the so-called &quot;father&quot; of thehydrogen bomb. Beginning in the mid-1960s, moreover, when hebegan speaking out against the policies of the Sovietgovernment -- and ultimately the whole communist system --Mr. Sakharov won even greater fame as the most privileged ofthe Soviet dissidents. For his public campaigns in defense ofhuman rights and the control of nuclear arms, he was awardedthe Nobel Peace Prize in 1975. And at the time of his deathin December, this recipient of some of the highest honors theSoviet regime could bestow -- Hero of Socialist Labor, winnerof the Stalin Prize, each accompanied by a large sum of money-- had become one of the leading spokesmen for democraticreform in the new Soviet parliament.   How this essentially shy and unworldly scientist emergedfrom what he called &quot;my hermetic world&quot; to become one of thecentury's most celebrated champions of human rights, and whathe and his loved ones were obliged to suffer, now is told atgreat length in Mr. Sakharov's &quot;Memoirs&quot; (Knopf, 775 pages,$29.95), a work that is required reading for anyoneattempting to understand the Soviet Union today.</LP><TEXT>   The book is of historic importance on a number of counts.It is the first, I believe, to take us inside the higheststratum of the Soviet scientific community and illuminateboth the political and the social conditions under which itfunctioned. (The Installation, as Mr. Sakharov calls it,where he lived and pursued his top-secret work on nuclearweapons for 20 years, was itself a kind of gilded gulag.) Thebook also is one of the first to explore the variegated worldof the Soviet dissident movement and identify some of theconflicts and suspicions that deeply divided it -- conflictsthat, in Mr. Sakharov's case, brought him into opendisagreement with, among others, Alexander Solzhenitsyn andRoy Medvedev.   Mr. Sakharov himself was an unlikely candidate for thetask of straddling the disparate worlds of Soviet privilegeand dissident revolt. By his own account, he had approachedhis work on the hydrogen bomb &quot;as a soldier&quot; whose loyaltywas never in doubt. While fully conscious of what hedescribed as &quot;the terrifying, inhuman nature of the weaponswe were building,&quot; Mr. Sakharov readily acknowledges that henonetheless found &quot;the physics of atomic and thermonuclearexplosions . . . a genuine theoretician's paradise.&quot;   In fact, it wasn't until he had successfully completed hiswork on the H-bomb that Mr. Sakharov woke up to theimplications of its use and to the real nature of the regimehis talents had served so faithfully. So deep was his feelingof attachment to the regime -- and, it must be said, so naivewas Mr. Sakharov about its tolerance of criticism -- thatwhen he took the fateful step of publishing his &quot;Reflectionson Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom&quot;in 1968, he promptly sent a copy to Leonid Brezhnev.   But with the publication of his &quot;Reflections,&quot; whichwithin a year sold more than 18 million copies around theworld -- &quot;in third place,&quot; Mr. Sakharov amusingly reports,&quot;after Mao Zedong and Lenin, and ahead of Georges Simenon andAgatha Christie&quot; -- he became the foremost figure of theentire dissident movement.   What is most remarkable and most moving about the storythat Mr. Sakharov recounts is both the speed and moral fervorwith which he pursued his new political life. Although new tothe arena of dissident action, he seems to have mastered itscomplex strategies as easily as he had surmounted the mostintractable scientific problems in his earlier life. Therecan be no doubt that his marriage to Elena Bonner enormouslystrengthened Mr. Sakharov in this remarkable endeavor. Hisfirst wife had died of cancer, and the account of his secondmarriage in &quot;Memoirs&quot; is at once a very touching love storyand a tale of intrepid political courage.   Many of Mr. Sakharov's activities as a dissident tookplace within the historical framework of the two militaryactions that did so much to destroy whatever remained of theSoviet regime's moral standing in the world -- the 1968invasion of Czechoslovakia and the 1979 invasion ofAfghanistan. It was the latter, of course, that led to Mr.Sakharov's enforced exile in the city of Gorky during theearly 1980s, and there is nothing more harrowing in this bookthan his account of the incessant harassment he and Ms.Bonner had to suffer at the hands of the KGB during thoseyears. Among much else, earlier drafts of and notes for&quot;Memoirs&quot; were stolen and had to be laboriously rewrittenfrom memory.   It is not only for this reason, however, that the booksuffers from some conspicuous literary deficiencies. Mr.Sakharov is not a literary artist, and he makes it clear tothe reader at the outset that &quot;This book is not a confession,nor do I lay claim to having produced a work of art.&quot;Needlessly repetitious at times, the book also is a good deallonger than it needs to be. Yet whatever its faults, thestory told in Mr. Sakharov's &quot;Memoirs&quot; is the story of one ofthe great moral victories of our time.   ---   Mr. Kramer is editor of the New Criterion.</TEXT></DOC>
