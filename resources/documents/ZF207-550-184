The guide/translator is the aff-singing,alldancing, object-oriented knowledge base.andP;  It's flexible.andP;  It speaks anylanguage fluently.andP;  It can answer the questions you ask, rather than simplygenerate canned reports.andP;  It can handle aB kinds of information andaccommodate many data types and structures, causeand-effect relationships,and so forth.andM;Now, how can we translate the guide/translator into software?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
