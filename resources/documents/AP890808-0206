The companies urged people to dial direct when possible, becausesuch calls are handled by computer. No major delays were reportedMonday for those calling without operator assistance.   ``We do have minor delays in directory assistance,'' said BobChez, a spokesman for Nevada Bell, part of Pacific Telesis.``People are having to wait a little longer. But other than thatthings are going smoothly.''   Operators, technicians, salespeople and clerical workers struckNYNEX Corp., Bell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis, three of theso-called Baby Bells, which were created by the 1984 breakup ofAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.   About 157,000 union workers were on strike Monday, forcingmanagers at the three companies to work long hours and learn thestrikers' tasks.   The strikes by the Communications Workers union and theInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers began over theweekend over salary, companies' attempts to shift health care coststo workers and local issues.   Negotiators scheduled talks between one union and Bell Atlantictoday, but no formal talks were set elsewhere. Informal discussionswere being held, however.   ``It seems like the sides are so far apart now, it could lastthree weeks,'' said Tom Bonelli, a striking nine-year veteran ofPacific Telesis.   Arrests were reported in Boston, where 14 people were chargedwith disorderly conduct for blocking a NYNEX building, police said.   Chesapeake andamp; Potomac Telephone Co. brought a court complaintagainst a union leader in Clarksburg, W.Va., because pickets kept asupervisor and vehicles from entering and leaving the office. Theunion called it a misunderstanding.   ATandamp;T, whose employees are not on strike, filed a complaint withthe National Labor Relations Board before pickets withdrew from adoor reserved for ATandamp;T workers in a building shared with NYNEX inProvidence, R.I.   In New York's Suffolk County, police said there were twoincidents of vandalism against New York Telephone companyequipment, but no indication that striking workers were involved. ANew York Telephone spokesman, Anthony Pappas, said a flammableliquid was poured into locked phone line distribution boxes and setafire, temporarily knocking out service to 1,900 customers.   At NYNEX offices, 10,000 managers took the places of about60,000 strikers.   ``Things are going as expected. There are delays in directoryassistance and other operator types of services, such as peopleneeding help making collect or third-party calls,'' said NYNEXspokesman John Bonomo.   He said managers are working long hours, but ``it's amorale-boosting kind of thing'' because people are ``workingtogether in a crisis.''   The striking workers, however, yelled ``Scab!'' at those goinginto the midtown headquarters of New York Telephone, a NYNEXsubsidiary.   The workers also urged passers-by not to pay their telephonebills.   CWA has a national strike defense fund containing $17 million to$18 million, and will pay strikers based on need after the secondweek, CWA spokesman Stephen Early said.   IBEW does not have a strike fund, and several workers Mondaysaid they were committed to the strike but worried about makingends meet.   ``The mortgage has got to be paid, and the state isn't in suchgreat shape to go look for other jobs,'' said Al Brown at a picketline at a NYNEX special service center in Boston.   NYNEX, with 60,000 strikers, serves most of New England and NewYork state; Bell Atlantic's 52,500 striking workers were inDelaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, WestVirginia, and Washington, D.C.; and Pacific Telesis, with 44,500workers off the job, serves northern Nevada and all of California.   More states could be affected next week, as strike deadlines forthree other regional Bell telephone companies, with more than130,000 union workers, are set for midnight Saturday. They areAmeritech, US West and Southwestern Bell.   A seventh phone company, Atlanta-based BellSouth, reached atentative agreement with unions representing 60,000 workers overthe weekend. That company serves nine Southeastern states.</TEXT></DOC>
