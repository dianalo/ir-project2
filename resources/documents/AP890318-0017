The song ``Spirit of the Forest'' is to be released in May andproceeds from its sales will go to rain forest preservation groups,said a statement Friday from K.A. Publicity of London.   ``A palpable sense of urgency surrounds the `Spirit of theForest' campaign,'' said the statement.   ``As Third World nations like Brazil continue to burn, harvestand plow under the forests for short-term human and corporate gain,the Earth faces increasing danger from global greenhouse warming anddesertification,'' it said.   The global warming trend called the ``greenhouse effect'' isthought to be caused in part by a surfeit of carbon dioxide in theatmosphere. Rain forests absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.   The statement said the song was originally written by anenvironmentalist English band, Gentlemen Without Weapons, for afund-raising gala last autumn organized by Friends of the Earth, U.K.   Two recording sessions _ in Los Angeles and in London _ have beencompleted and three others _ in New York, Rio de Janeiro and in anAmazon rain forest _ are scheduled in April, the statement said.
