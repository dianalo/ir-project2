Theposterior lobe of the pituitary gland on high-field (1.5 Tesla) magneticresonance (MR) imaging was evaluated in 5 patients, including one primary(idiopathic) and four secondary DI due to two germinomas, teratoma, andhistiocytosis X. A normal posterior lobe is demonstrated as a high signalindistinguishable from fatty tissue on T/sub 1/ WI (a short T/sub 1/value). In all 5 DI cases, the normal high signal of the posterior lobewas not detected in the pituitary fossa on T/sub 1/ WI. MR imaging isa great help in the diagnosis of DI, and this characteristic findingsuggests that the short T/sub 1/ value of the posterior lobe is closelyrelated to the functional integrity of the posterior lobe and may bedue to the neurosecretory materials in the axons of the hypothalamo-hypophysealtract.</TEXT></DOC>
