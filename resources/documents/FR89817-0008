Part 213 sets forth the rules governing traderemedy assistance provided by the Commission through the Trade Remedy AssistanceOffice. Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 21, 1988 (53 FR 51281) and interestedpersons were given until February 6, 1989, to submit comments. None weresubmitted.The revisions to part 213 conform the rules to the changes made in section339 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1339) by section 1614 of the OmnibusTrade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (``the Omnibus Trade Act''). Theamendments provide that an office to be known as the Trade Remedy AssistanceOffice (``Office'') is established in the Commission; that the Office shallprovide advice and assistance concerning remedies and procedures underthe trade laws identified in section 339 of the Tariff Act of 1930; andthat the Office, in coordination with other agencies administering tradelaws, shall provide technical assistance to eligible small businesses toassist them in seeking relief under the identified trade laws. Technicalassistance shall be available to assist eligible small businesses in preparingcomplaints or petitions for relief and in any consequent administrativereview or appeal to the administering agency.The final rules adopted closely follow those proposed and published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>of December 21, 1988 with the exception of (1)non-substantive or grammatical changes to reduce redundant explanationsand to make the final rules easier to understand; (2) the addition of arequirement that trade associations applying for technical assistance fromthe Trade Remedy Assistance Office provide a listing of members; (3) theremoval of the application form for technical assistance from the rulesthemselves. The added requirement that trade associations applying fortechnical assistance provide a listing of members is intended to enablethe Commission to verify the eligibility of such applicants. The applicationform for technical assistance was removed from the rules because the formitself does not affect the substantive requirements for obtaining technicalassistance from the Trade Remedy Assistance Office.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>September 18, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500E Street SW., Washington, DC, 20436.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Gary L.

Hearing impaired individuals may obtainfurther information on this matter by contacting the Commission's TDD terminalat (202) 252-1810.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Commission has determined thatthe revisions do not constitute a ``major rule'' within the meaning ofExecutive Order 12291 (Improving Government Relations) and do not exerta ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities''within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b).<ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Revisions to 19 CFR Part 213</ITAG>Section 213.1Section 213.1 is amended to refer to the new statutory provisions in theOmnibus Trade Act, to identify the Trade Remedy Assistance Office, to incorporatethe statutory requirement of assisting and advising interested partiesconcerning remedies and procedures under the trade laws listed in andSection;213.2(b) of this part, and to indicate that the Trade Remedy AssistanceOffice, in coordination with the other agencies responsible for administeringthese trade laws, shall provide technical assistance to eligible smallbusinesses seeking relief under these trade laws.Section 213.2Existing andSection; 213.2 has been deleted, because it is duplicative ofthe requirements for assistance set forth in existing andSection; 213.4,renumbered as andSection; 213.3.Section 213.3Section 213.3 is renumbered andSection; 213.2. Section 213.3(a) is renumberedandSection; 213.2(a) and amended to reflect the replacement of the ``TradeRemedy Assistance Center'' by the ``Trade Remedy Assistance Office,'' toinclude and to correct the Office's address which appears in existing ruleandSection; 213.4, to incorporate the new statutory requirement of advisingand assisting interested parties concerning remedies and procedures, andto provide that technical assistance, as defined andSection; 213.2(d), isto be coordinated with the other agencies responsible for administeringthe trade laws listed in andSection; 213.2(b).Section 213.3(b) is renumbered andSection;213.2(b) and amended to replacethe words ``Trade Remedy Laws'' with the term ``Trade Laws,'' which appearsin section 339 of the Tariff Act of 1930, and to list each of the tradelaws in the statute since the Office is now required to provide technicalassistance regarding all of these laws. Prior to passage of the OmnibusTrade Act, the Trade Remedy Assistance Center was responsible for providingtechnical assistance only with regard to those trade remedy laws administeredby the Commission. Section 406 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2436,relating to market disruption investigations) is also included in the listof trade laws in andSection;213.2(b). Although section 406 is not includedin the trade laws listed in section 339 of the Tariff Act of 1930, it isadministered by the Commission, it provides for relief similar to thatwhich may be obtained under section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, (19 U.S.C.2251) and it is included in the list of ``Trade Remedy Laws'' appearingin existing andSection;213.3(b). A new andSection;213.2(c) is added to define the term ``administering agency''as used in these proposed rules and to identify the agency or agenciesresponsible for administering each of the trade laws listed in andSection;213.2(b)Existing andSection;213.3(c) is renumbered andSection;213.2(d) and adds languageindicating that technical assistance is available during administrativereview or appeals to the administering agency. Under the prior law andthe existing rule, technical assistance was limited to the period ``upto the date of the filing of a petition or complaint at the Commission.''Language has been added to reflect that technical assistance, which includesinformal legal advice and assistance, does not include legal representationof an eligible small business or advocacy on its behalf, and that the receiptof such assistance does not ensure that the recipient will prevail in anytrade remedy proceeding. <T3>See </T3>H.R. Rep. No. 40, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 172-173 (1987). Languagealso has been added to this section to indicate that, as had been the practiceof the Trade Remedy Assistance Center, the staff of the Office may consultwith other Commission personnel when provding technical assistance. Existing andSection;213.3(d) is renumbered andSection;213.2(e), but is otherwisewithout substantive change. Existing andSection;213.3(e) is renumbered andSection;213.2(f)and amended to refer to SBA size standards as the basis for determiningthe eligibility of a small business for technical assistance.

Section 213.4(a) is renumberedandSection;213.3(a), retitled more appropriately ``Application for TechnicalAssistance from Small Businesses,'' and amended to delete the Office'saddress and to add language that an application for assistance is availablefrom the Office. Otherwise this section is substantively the same as existingandSection;213.4(a). Section 213.4(b) is renumbered andSection;213.3(b) andretitled more appropriately ``Application for Technical Assistance fromJoint Applicants, Trade Associations and Unions,'' but is substantivelyunchanged from existing andSection;213.4(b), except for the new requirementthat trade associations must provide a list of members to be eligible fortechnical assistance. Sections 213.4(c) is renumbered andSection;213.3(c),retitled more appropriately ``Determination of Eligibility and Notificationof Determination,'' and amended to recite that the Office will make a determinationof eligibility. Section 213.4(d) is renumbered andSection;213.3(d), but isnot substantively changed from existing andSection;213.4(d). Section 213.5 Section 213.5 is renumbered andSection;213.4 and amended to add the requirementthat an eligible small business that has received technical assistancefrom the Office must disclose that fact in any petition, application orcomplaint filed with any other agency which administers the trade law underwhich remedies or benefits are sought. In the existing rule, such disclosurewas only required for petitions or complaints filed with the Commission.This change is consistent with the requirement in the Omnibus Trade Actthat the Office shall now provide technical assistance regarding all thelisted trade laws. Section 213.6 Section 213.6 is renumbered andSection;213.5, but is not substantively changedfrom existing andSection;213.6.
