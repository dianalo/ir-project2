The Moline, Ill., farm-equipment giant said its loss forthe period ended Jan. 31 was $19.9 million, or 26 cents ashare, an improvement over the year-earlier loss of $43.1million, or 57 cents a share.</LP><TEXT>   Revenue was $1.45 billion in the latest quarter,essentially flat with the year-earlier $1.44 billion.   Deere said the slimmer deficit it incurred was &quot;due mainlyto more efficient operations and improved pricerealiza-tion,&quot; and it noted that the improvement in itsresults came &quot;despite sales and production volumes which wererelatively unchanged from 1991's depressed first quarter.&quot;   While production in the first quarter is normally lowbecause of seasonal factors, Deere said, &quot;Weak retail demandin all of our markets and our ongoing efforts to reducecompany and dealers' inventories resulted in even lowervolumes, having a particularly severe effect on our firstquarter results.&quot;   Deere said its outlook for the remainder of the year&quot;remains uncertain,&quot; because &quot;recessionary pressures and alow level of customer confidence continue to affect marketsfor our industrial and lawn and grounds care products.&quot; Andwhile North American agriculture's economic fundamentalsremain relatively strong, it said, &quot;farmers' buying attitudesappear cautious.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
