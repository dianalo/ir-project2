Cooper's</HEAD><BYLINE>By BOB BAUM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A lawyer seeking to determine the fate ofD.B. Cooper claims to have found part of the parachute the legendaryhijacker used to escape from a jetliner 17 years ago Friday with a$200,000 ransom.   Richard Tosaw, of Ceres, Calif., said a diver he hired discoveredan 18-inch-wide ``pilot'' parachute Monday in the Columbia Riverabout 5 miles west of Vancouver, which lies across the river fromPortland, Ore.   The parachute, which deploys a diver's main parachute, was foundabout a mile upstream from the spot where $5,800 of Cooper's ransomwashed up in 1980, he said.   The 63-year-old attorney said the discovery indicates that Cooperprobably landed in the river and died, Tosaw said.   ``Everybody's got to be somewhere and that guy is in the river,''he said.   But the man who packed Cooper's parachute said Tuesday he doubtsthe pilot parachute came from the hijacker.   ``I think it is publicity,'' said Earl Cossey of Woodinville,Wash., near Seattle.   ``I'm kind of suspicious. Every year about D.B. Cooper'sanniversary they seem to find something. Why don't they findsomething in July?'' Cossey said. He said the parachute sounds likeit is of an earlier generation than the one he packed for thehijacker.   Cooper used the name of Dan Cooper when he boarded aSeattle-bound Northwest Air Lines 727 in Portland on Nov. 24, 1971,the day before Thanksgiving. News accounts initially called him D.B.Cooper, though, and the moniker stuck.   After takeoff, Cooper displayed what an attendant said lookedlike dynamite and demanded four parachutes and $200,000, which hepicked up in Seattle. After the plane took off for Reno, Nev.,Cooper jumped out and hasn't been seen or heard from since.   Tosaw, who has written a book titled ``D.B. Cooper, Dead orAlive,'' said he believes Cooper's body is trapped on one of thejetties of telephone poles built into the river about everyhalf-mile to prevent shore erosion. The pilot parachute was foundbehind one such jetty in about 20 feet of water, he said.   Curtis Rainey, 33, the diver who made the discovery, planned toshow the pilot parachute to Cossey over Thanksgiving.   Cossey, a licensed parachute rigger whom Northwest hired toprovide gear for Cooper, said pilot parachutes don't bear anyidentifying marks or registration numbers, unlike the main parachute.   ``There are probably a million of those (pilot parachutes) in theworld,'' he said from his home.   John Eyer, assistant in charge of the Seattle FBI office, saidTosaw hadn't informed the agency of the discovery.   Tosaw began looking for Cooper seven years ago and said he alwaystimes his searches to coincide with the hijacking's anniversary. Hesaid he will resume the hunt next year.   ``I'd like to fish him out of there on Thanksgiving Day,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
