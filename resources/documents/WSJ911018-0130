Mr. Mahoney characterized his 1991 estimate as&quot;conservative.&quot; It indicates fourth-quarter net income ofabout 80 cents a share, which is within a range of analystestimates of 75 cents to 90 cents a share that Mr. Mahoneysaid he also finds comfortable.</LP><TEXT>   The 1992 earnings gain is expected to arise from acombination of cost reduction and revenue gains, he said inan interview, with most of the revenue increase coming fromoverseas.   The Canton, Ohio, producer of automated teller machines,other bank equipment and security systems and services lastyear earned $27.1 million, or $2.05 a share, on sales of$476.1 million. However, the company in last year's thirdquarter incurred a pretax restructuring charge of $6.4million. Officials were in Cleveland to address securitiesanalysts.   The company recently reported third-quarter net of 70cents a share, up from the charge-reduced 17 cents a share ayear earlier and slightly more than most analysts expected.Revenue rose 10% to $126.7 million. Nine-month per-share netwas $1.60, up from $1.35 the year before.   Like many other corporate executives, Mr. Mahoney said heexpects relatively sluggish economic growth in 1992, both inthe U.S. and in many European countries. &quot;I think 1992 willbe better than 1991, but not anything to get excited about,&quot;he said. A recent trip to Europe turned up real economicstrength only in Spain and Germany, he said.   However, Diebold's 70%-owned subsidiary, InterBold, lastmonth introduced a new ATM that Mr. Mahoney said will helpincrease the company's market share. The new machine has fourtimes the reliability of competing machines and requires 40%less maintenance, he said, and is guaranteed to operate 99%of the time.   He said the company thinks it increased its share of theATM market in the U.S. during the first nine months andexpects to pick up four to five percentage points of U.S.market share for all of 1991.   He said NCR Corp., Dayton, Ohio, will emerge as a strongercompetitor following the merger into American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. because it will have the support of basicresearch done at ATandamp;T's Bell Labs unit. However, NCR may betemporarily distracted by the merger, he said. He discountedthe importance of bank resentment that NCR will be joining amajor issuer of credit cards. ATandamp;T's credit card competeswith those offered by banks.   Diebold's profit next year will benefit from a cut inresearch, development and product engineering expenses of $4million to $5 million, he said. Those costs will rise thisyear to about $34 million, from $20.3 million in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
