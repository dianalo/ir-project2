KeyCorp, for example, would not have fared as well if itweren't for the benefits of additional net interest incomefrom its recently acquired thrift branches. Its stock closedyesterday unchanged at $34 in composite trading on the NewYork Stock Exchange.</LP><TEXT>   And although UJB Financial Corp.'s earnings improved fromthe previous quarter, it continued to be hurt by economicconditions in the area, said T. Joseph Semrod, chairman andchief executive officer. &quot;The depressed real estate marketwas our major problem area throughout the past year andremains an area of concern in 1991,&quot; he said. The prognosisdidn't help its stock, which fell 25 cents to close at $12.50cents a share in trading on the Big Board.   Similarly, People's Bank blamed problem loans for itsloss.   Smaller regional banks -- Anchor Bancorp Inc., WilmingtonTrust Co. and New York Bancorp Inc. -- fared better, postinga major turnaround or increased earnings. Reflecting theimprovement, their shares rose in over-the-counter trading.                                                                                                          KeyCorp                                                                                                          The Albany, N.Y., bank holding concern reported that netinterest income -- the difference between interest paid ondeposits and received from loans -- rose 21% to $198.4million from $164.4 million a year ago.   The bank credited the earnings improvement to realizingthe benefits from the acquired branches of Empire FederalSavings Bank of America from federal regulators in October.   But while asset growth was strong in the western parts ofNew York, the bank said it &quot;continued to experience assetdeterioration in Eastern New York, Long Island and Maine.&quot; Itset aside $30.5 million as provision for possible loan lossescompared to $13.6 million a year ago.                                                                                                          UJB Financial                                                                                                          Nonperforming assets for the Princeton, N.J.-based bankingconcern rose to $569.6 million at the end of the firstquarter from $517.1 million in the fourth quarter and morethan doubled from the year-earlier $244.6 million. The banksaid a significant portion of its bad real estate exposure isin residential projects, which are in a period of lowerdemand.   Reserves for loan losses increased to $285.9 million as itset aside $51 million in the latest quarter from $126.2million a year ago when it provided $20 million.                                                                                                          People's Bank                                                                                                          The Bridgeport, Conn., bank attributed its loss to a $47.4million loan-loss provision as compared to a provision of$16.9 million a year ago. The higher provision was promptedby a 15% increase in non-performing assets which rose to$531.5 million from $461.1 million at 1990 year end and$210.1 million in the year ago period.

Despite the improvement, the bank said it will likely missits capital targets under its capital plan by &quot;a significantamount&quot; as it suffers from adverse market conditions forassets. As a result it said it has targeted $380 million inloans and mortgage-backed securities for possible sale in thecurrent quarter.
