The layoffs affect about 1% of the combined work force of the two chip makers. Earlier this month, National completed the acquisition of Fairchild from Schlumberger Ltd. for $122 million in common stock and warrants. National employs about 29,000 people; Fairchild has about 9,000 employees.    The reductions weren't unexpected and there may be more. National said it is &quot;continuing to review all operations,&quot; which could lead to other cuts. &quot;A key consideration of this restructuring is the alignment of personnel and organizations to further enhance our customer service and support,&quot; Charles Sporck, National's chief executive officer, said.    More than 300 of the layoffs are in the combined companies' field sales operations, with the rest at Fairchild's Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, and National's Portland, Ore.-based Microcomputer Products division, National said.    The company said it would make severance payments and offer job-placement help to those laid off. It added that it previously had assigned financial reserves to cover such costs. </TEXT></DOC>
