The poll, conducted for Sunday magazine, indicates Gandhi'sparty will win only 180 to 215 seats in the 542-member Parliament,a steep fall from the 415 seats it won in 1984.   ``The Indian voter is angry, disillusioned and cynical. Most ofthat resentment will probably find its way to the polling booth inthe form of a vote against Congress (Party),'' the weekly magazinesaid in a preview Thursday. Full results are to be releasedSaturday.   The party is contesting 509 seats in the Nov. 22, 24 and 26elections that poll analysts say will be the toughest for the partysince 1977 when it lost for the only time since independence fromBritain in 1947.   At that time, the opposition had united. It soon splintered dueto internal squabbles and the Congress came back to power in the1980 elections.   This year, major opposition parties again united to form acoalition led by Vishwanath Pratap Singh, who resigned in 1987 asGandhi's defense minister.   However, Sunday magazine said its poll showed ``it is thenegative vote that will decide this election,'' the ninth sinceIndia gained independence.   Although the voter does not perceive opposition politicians alsoas honest, anger at government corruption will result in negativevote, said the poll, which questioned 11,500 voters in 38constituencies.   A Congress Party spokesman, Anand Sharma, dismissed the results.   ``In the 1984 elections the same magazine said the Congress(Party) will win 250 seats,'' Sharma said. ``If they were that wideoff the mark, then they have not shown any substantialimprovement.''   The 1984 polls were conducted by a different agency.   More than half the voters asked in northern and western Indiabelieved that corruption has increased since Gandhi came to powerin 1984, the latest poll found. These concerns were nationwide, butvoters in the south were less concerned about corruption.   ``An alarmingly large proportion of respondents believe that theprime minister is personally corrupt,'' said the poll, which themagazine said was largest of its kind ever conducted in India.   Gandhi has been dogged since April 1987 by allegations thatmembers of his party and senior government officials received asmuch as $50 million in kickbacks in a $1.4 billion gun contractwith a Swedish company, AB Bofors.   Gandhi, repeatedly denying the charge, has also said no Indianreceived commissions or kickbacks from Bofors. But the issue hasbeen seized upon by the opposition as its main campaign platform.   Gandhi's landslide victory in December 1984 was attributed tothe sympathy wave generated by the assassination two months earlierof Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, his mother.   The last poll was published in August by the newsmagazine IndiaToday. That poll predicted the Congress Party would win 314 seats _but only if the opposition parties failed to unite. It said aunited opposition could cut the Congress Party's seats to 244, lessthan half the seats in Parliament.</TEXT></DOC>
