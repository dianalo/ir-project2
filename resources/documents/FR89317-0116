Pub. L. 100-690. Sections509F and 509G of that law authorized grants to public and private profitand nonprofit entities to demonstrate model projects for substance usingpregnant and postpartum women and their infants. In accordance with thislegislation, the Office for Substance Abuse Prevention (OSAP) will fundprojects that focus on prevention, education, and treatment located incommunity, inpatient, outpatient, and residential settings.The Office of Maternal and Child Health (OMCH) has broad, ongoing mandateto promote the health of mothers and infants. Therefore, OMCH is joiningwith OSAP in providing funds for a collaborative, inter-agency grant programto support demonstration projects.There is increased clinical and research evidence of the wide array ofpotential consequences of maternal use of alcohol and other drugs to offspring.These effects include retarded fetal growth, premature and/or complicateddelivery, low birth weight, infant mortality, drug-specific neonatal withdrawalsyndromes, and infant mental and physical developmental deficits. Evenwith improved obstetrical service, many infants born to mothers using somesubstances are difficult to nurse. These babies show signs of poor motorcontrol, have difficulty learning, and appear either hyperactive or hypoactivein response to their environment.Women using substances during pregnancy have multiple needs, includingthe need for alcohol and drug abuse treatment, health care needs, and avariety of psychosocial needs. They often face simultaneous stresses ofpoverty, addiction, and new motherhood with inadequate support and socialresources.To exacerbate these problems, service delivery systems are often uncoordinatedand/or inadequate. For example, many substance abuse treatment programsrefuse to serve pregnant women. Many maternal health care facilities areinadequately prepared for the problems of substance using women. Furthermore,these women are often difficult to locate. Once located, they are oftenreluctant or simply disinterested in receiving services. Even after successfulidentification and recruitment, program attrition rates are usually high.Despite these difficulties, it is important that new and continuing effortsbe made to minimize fetal exposure effects. Towards this end, it is necessaryto coordinate a variety of service delivery systems and/or to provide newor expanded services where gaps exist. Such services must include a continuumof therapeutic programs, comprehensive supportive services, and medicalcare in a readily accessible form. Service providers should take a longitudinalperspective, considering the needs of the women and their babies before,during and after delivery. Extensive community outreach and retention effortsmust be made to eliminate existing barriers to treatment.This Request for Applications solicits applications for <T3>service demonstration projects </T3>that propose promising models orinnovative approaches to the issues outlined above. All projects will beexpected to have a well developed program evaluation plan which is derivedfrom the service activities of the project. Applicant should propose approacheswith a sound conceptual basis consistent with state of the art practices,knowledge and theories in the fields of prevention and treatment.However, OSAP does not support <T3>research or research demonstrations. </T3>Accordingly, applicationsusing rigorously controlled comparative experimental designs for the purposeof assessing the efficacy of particular interventions may be more appropriatefor the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) or the National Instituteon Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). In particular, see RFA DA-89-03available from NIDA. Applications may not be submitted to both NIDA andOSAP for the same programmatic activities and/or the same client population. <ITAG tagnum="84">Program Goals</ITAG>The goals of this announcement are to identify and fund a number of programsto develop and implement promising or innovative service programs and activitiesto:_Promote the involvement and coordinated participation of multiple organizationsin the delivery of comprehensive services for substance using pregnantand postpartum women and their infants:_Increase the availability and accessibility of prevention, early intervention,and treatment services for these populations;_Decrease the incidence and prevalence of drug and alcohol use among pregnantand postpartum women;_Improve the birth outcomes of women who used alcohol and other drugs duringpregnancy and to decrease the incidence of infants affected by maternalsubstance use; and_Reduce the severity of impairment among children born to substance usingwomen.The specific aims and objectives of an applicant need not address all ofthese program goals. However, proposed projects should be consonant withone or more of these goals. <ITAG tagnum="84">Program Emphasis Parameters </ITAG>A. <T3>Populations. </T3>The ultimate target of projects should be potentialor current substance using pregnant and postpartum women and their infants,with priority for low-income women. These populations (thereafter referredto as the target populations) may be targeted directly or through otherpopulations, including women entering the family planning process, malepartners of substance abusing pregnant or postpartum women, foster parentsof infants affected by maternal substance use, physical and mental healthservice providers, drug abuse treatment providers, and a variety of socialservice agents who have contact with the target populations.B. <T3>Settings. </T3>Project activities may be community-based or may belocated in inpatient, outpatient, or residential settings.C. <T3>Modes of intervention. </T3>Project incorporating prevention (includingeducation), early intervention, and/or treatment are eligible.D. <T3>Target substances. </T3>All non-prescribed drugs, including alcoholand tobacco, are eligible targets for intervention. A project may focuson poly-substance use or the use of a single substance.E. <T3>Needs. </T3>Applicants are encouraged to address the complex and variedneeds of the target populations in a comprehensive, holistic manner, whereappropriate. These needs can be broadly categorized as:1. Biological/physical (e.g., detoxification, dietary, obstetrical)2. Psychological (e.g., support, treatment for anxiety, depression, lowself-esteem)3. Instrumental (e.g., child care and transportation to facilitate thereceipt of services, housing)4. Informational and educational_multiple skills and behaviors (e.g., prenataland post partum health, substance use, parenting)Many desired outcomes (e.g., drug-free pregnant women, healthy infants)require attention to all of these need categories.The combinations of these parameters (needs, substances, populations, settings,and intervention modalities) result in numerous potential projects whichcould meet the intent of the grants program. While a variety of approacheswill be funded, the diverse needs of the target population(s) and the frequentgaps in the service delivery systems require an emphasis on programs whichprovide or coordinate a comprehensive service system meeting multiple needs.The development of entirely new services would often duplicate existingservices, thus creating inefficiency and further fragmenting service deliveryin the eyes of clients. For these reasons, it is <T3>highly recommended, </T3>whenever possible, to create structures andprocesses which will result in the coordinated use of existing services.Development of new service components should be limited to situations wheresuch services do not currently exist, or where they are inadequate.These systems of comprehensive services should be ``user friendly'' orotherwise structured to insure that high-risk clients actually receivethe intended services. One means of increasing the use of services is theinvolvement of existing social networks and natural support systems (e.g.,family, neighbors, churches). These entities can be employed at the multiplepoints of identification, recruitment, and service delivery.It is also recognized that, in many communities, existing services areinadequate or even non-existent. Where such gaps exist, applicants maypropose the addition of new services, or the expansion or augmentationof existing services if they are incomplete or not meeting the existinglevels of need. Applicants may therefore propose any of the following typesof projects (or combinations thereof):1. Coordination and integration of existing services 2. Outreach_Identification of the target populations and encouragement(e.g., social or instrumental support) for receipt of services3. Reduction of cost or other means of increasing the accessibility andacceptance of services4. Expansion of existing services (where need exceeds supply or where certainpopulations are not adequately served)5. Augmentation of existing services (e.g., the addition of prenatal and/orpost partum care to drug treatment programs or vice versa)6. The creation of new comprehensive servicesAn outreach approach with no service delivery component would only be acceptableif the applicant could provide evidence that sufficient services are alreadyin place. Conversely, the creation of entirely new comprehensive serviceswould only be acceptable if the applicant can demonstrate there are noappropriate existing services.Activities for Which Grant Support Is AvailableProposed activities should be consistent with the orientation describedabove. Examples of such activities, to be implemented individually or (preferably)in some combination, may include, but are not limited to:<ITAG tagnum="81">Primary Prevention</ITAG>_Information and education on substance use at the point of family planning_Media campaigns and other forms of public education concerning the risksof substance use during pregnancy<ITAG tagnum="81">Intervention With Pregnant and Post Partum Women</ITAG>_Implementation and routinization of effective screening of pregnant womenfor past and present substance use and abuse _Innovative methods of outreach to identify and recruit the target populationsfor services, preferably early in the pregnancy_Integration and coordination of alcohol and other drug treatment withprenatal and/or post partum health care _Psychological and emotional support for pregnant and/or post partum substanceusing women_Education and skill-building for the target populations designed to increasethe likelihood of positive familial and social functioning (e.g., parentingskills, job-seeking skills)_Support services (e.g., childcare, transportation) to facilitate women'suse of other services (auxiliary to other service delivery)_Advocacy for the assurance of rights and development of resources forthe target populations<ITAG tagnum="81">Infant Interventions</ITAG>_Direct intervention/treatment/rehabilitation with infants and very youngchildren (up to 36 months of age) to reduce or attenuate the impact ofmaternal substance use _Instrumental, informational, and emotional support and resources for biologicor foster parents of infants affected by maternal substance use (follow-upservices)<ITAG tagnum="81">Service Delivery Strategies</ITAG>_Coordination for purposes of identification and/or service delivery withother likely points of access for high-risk women (e.g., shelters, AFDC,WIC programs, crisis pregnancy centers, public housing, law enforcement,jails)_Involvement of significant others (e.g., male partners) as direct interventiontargets or to aid in the outreach and service delivery processes for women_Co-location or multiple locations (e.g., satellite centers, extensionservices, ``one-stop shopping'') to increase access and facilitate servicedelivery_Innovative strategies (e.g., case management) to insure the coordinatedutilization of generally unrelated service systems <ITAG tagnum="81">Personnel Strategies</ITAG>_Inter-organizational personnel exchange for the creation of interdisciplinaryteams within multiple service settings _Expaneded roles of professionals and other caregivers to encourage a comprehehsivesystem of services_Continuing education of professionals regarding the needs and interventionstrategies appropriate for the target populations <ITAG tagnum="84">Project Requirements</ITAG>In addition to each individual project's evaluation plans, all projectswill be required to participate in a national process evaluation.

Annual awards will be made subject to continuedavailability of funds and progress achieved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Availability of Funds</ITAG>In FY 1989, it is estimated that approximately $4.5 million will be availableto support approximately 20-25 grants. It is expected that individual projectfunding needs will vary widely. The average amount of an award is expectedto be approximately $200,000 per year, including direct and indirect costs.Applicants are discouraged from applying for more than $300,000. However,the amount of funding will depend upon the availability of funds and programpriorities at the time of the award.<ITAG tagnum="84">Application Procedure</ITAG>Application kits (PHS 398; rev. 9/86) and (PHS 5161; rev. 4/88) with guidancefor OSAP applications (pages 10-16 of the announcement) are available from:National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information (NCADI) P.O.

Sections A-E may not exceed a total length of25 single-spaced pages. Sections F and G may not exceed a total lengthof 10 pages. Applications exceeding these page limits (for the narrativesection) will not be accepted for review. The page limit will be rigorouslyenforced. Returned applications will be eligible for resubmission, afterappropriate revisions, at the next application receipt date. Suggestionsfor page lengths for specific sub-sections of the narrative are merelyfor guidance and may be modified by the applicant. Appendices may be attachedfor technical or specialized materials but should not be used merely toextend the narrative.<T3>Abstract_</T3>This should precede the body of the narrative, be single-spaced,and should not exceed 30 lines. The abstract should clearly present thegrant application in summary form, from a ``who-what-when-how-where'' pointof view. It should allow reviewers to see how the multiple parts of theapplication fit together to form a coherent whole. The abstract shouldnot be counted toward the narrative page total.<T3>Index Page_</T3>Immediately following the abstract page, the applicantis required to provide an index page identifying the page where each sectionof the outline begins. Sections A-E of the outline may not exceed 25 singlespaced pages. Sections F and G may not exceed 10 pages, so that the totallength of these sections will not exceed 35 pages.The following sections A-G replace the general instructions for completingsection 2 (Research Plan) of the application form 398 or the program narrativeof the application Form PHS 5161-1:A. Specific AimsIdentify the goals and specific objectives for the proposed project andhow these relate to the goals stated in this grant announcement. (Suggestedlength: one-half to one page)B. Background and SignificanceDemonstrate familiarity with and understanding of previous work done inthe area of the proposed project. A brief review of the literature andof other related projects or studies, as well as any relevant prior work,observations, or experiences of the applicant should be included in thissection. (Suggested length: 1-3 pages)C. Target Population_ConfidentialityThis section should include a rationale, preliminary analysis and operationaldefinition(s) of the target population(s) in the proposed project; a summaryof currently available data on the target population(s) (e.g., incidenceand/or prevalence, location, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics,minority composition); discussion of available human services for the targetpopulation(s); and a discussion of the gaps and other problems in the availabilityand acceptability of prevention and/or treatment services for the population(s).Given the legitimate fears of retribution or loss of custody felt by manysubstance abusing pregnant women, all projects should attempt to createa supportive, rather than punitive atmosphere. <T3>Applicants should describe procedures used to insure confidentialityand protection of clients in this section. </T3>At a minimum awardees mustagree to maintain the confidentiality of alcohol and drug abuse clientdata in accordance with the regulations governing, ``Confidentiality ofAlcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records,'' (42 CFR Part 2). (Suggested length;2-4 pages)D. Approach/MethodDiscuss the approach to be used in conducting the proposed demonstrationproject with attention to detail. The following information must be provided:_Procedures for gaining access to the target group. Applicants should indicateplans for dealing with the difficult issues of identification, recruitment,involvement, retention, and follow-up with these populations._Where appropriate, plans for any special attention to be given to theunique needs and concerns of members of social and ethnic minority groupswithin the target population(s)._A plan of action that describes the project, discusses how each activityrelated to the project will be approached, coordinated with existing programs(where appropriate), and implemented. Program components should be relatedto information from the background section of the proposal (needs, existingservices, previous accomplishments)._An impact model that provides reasoning for the linkages between specificprogram activities and immediate as well as eventual expected outcomes(intervention rationale)._Where appropriate, evidence of coordination with related Federal, State,and local programs. There is a strong need for coordination among health,social service, voluntary and other relevant community-based organizationsand service systems. Such coordination allows more efficient use of fundsand reduces duplication of services. Demonstration of a proposed comprehensiveand coordinated service delivery can be accomplished using a continuumof approaches. At one end of the continuum, applications from a consortiumof organizations would be accepted, though one organization would be requiredto accept responsibility for project management. Specific working agreements(pending funding) should be included as appendices, where appropriate.Justification should be provided if no such working agreements are included.Evidence of existing or previous joint efforts should be submitted, ifavailable. At a minimum, letters of support from all cooperating organizationsshould be provided. Such letters should be specific with respect to thecommitment (e.g., personnel and other resources, access to populations)and the intent of the organizations involved. Specific working agreementsand letters of support should be attached as appendices.The applicant should also discuss the anticipated impact of the projecton the problems of the target population(s) and the gaps in the servicedelivery systems for this population(s). The following must be addressed:_Estimated the number and composition of individuals to be served or otherwiseaddressed for each year._State the anticipated specific program accomplishments for each year (e.g.,program linkages made, materials developed, procedures implemented)._State specific anticipated outcomes for each year (e.g., number of clientsserved, reduction in substance use in target population, increase in skills).E. Evaluation PlanOSAP will support only projects with a well-developed evaluation plan.As part of the application screening and review processes, applicationswill be examined for the presence of a viable evaluation component. Applicationswith a clearly inadequate evaluation plan will be judged to be incompleteand removed from further review.Applicants should have appropriate evaluation expertise on their staffor should make arrangements for obtaining such consultation to assist inachieving these objectives. The results of such consultation should beapparent in the application.All projects should conduct both process and outcome evaluations. Together,the process and outcome evaluations should allow an assessment of the extentto which the project's goals were met.The process evaluation should be sufficient to facilitate replication ofthe project if the approach proves promising. The process evaluation consistsof the collection of quantitative and qualitative data that permit a descriptionof the implementation of the project (e.g., description of size and natureof client population, staff characteristics, amount and types of servicesprovided). The results of the process evaluation should be a useful descriptionand operationalization of who provided what services to whom, when, howoften, and in what setting(s).Program evaluation plans should also include outcome/impact evaluationplans directed toward assessing whether the program was effective in meetingits goals and where possible show that these effects are specific to theimplemented intervention(s) as opposed to other factors. The nature ofthe outcome data will vary as a function of the goals of the project. Examplesof outcome variables for projects focused on the provision of prenatalcare might include the number of prenatal visits, the month of pregnancyduring which the first visit occurred, characteristics of the birth (e.g.,length of gestation, birthweight, Apgar score, special care requirements).At a minimum, applicants should include a plan and timeline for an outcomeevaluation, to be operational by at least the start of Year 2. Dependingon the complexity of the program and the degree to which the first yearof funding is devoted to implementation and stabilization, it may be unrealisticto expect evidence of effectiveness during the first year. However, itwould be considered advisable to collect such data on a trial or pilotbasis, as well as to provide baseline information for comparison purpose.If the proposed project contains linkages with other programs, the evaluationshould address the total comprehensive service array and not just the specificservices provided by the applicant (if any).For both outcome and process evaluations, applications should provide anevaluation design, including a description of the proposed instruments(with copies added as appendices if available), a schedule and procedurefor the collection of data, and a description of the data analysis plan.(Suggested length 2-3 pages)F. Project Staffing, Management and Organization <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Organizational Structure</ITAG>Provide a narrative description of the organizational structure of theproposed demonstration project. This description should clearly indicatethe organizational relationships and responsibilities of the Project Directorand each project unit or activity. It should also indicate the percentageof time devoted to the project by all staff. Indication should be providedas to which positions require new hiring.The responsibilities and composition of Boards_of Supervisors, Directors,Trustees, and/or Advisors_should be included, where applicable.Provide a description of organizational relationships between the applicantand other State/local level health and human services agencies as theserelate to the proposed project.

Staffing Pattern</ITAG>Biographical sketches should be included on the appropriate pages of theform PHS 398 or included in a readily identifiable appendix. These sketchesshould not be counted toward the page limit. Experience and/or trainingpertinent to the proposed project should be highlighted.Job descriptions must be submitted, as appendices, for each key professionalposition identified in the proposed budget. Only one job description needsto be submitted for identical positions. Job descriptions should include:job title, description of duties and responsibilities, qualifications forposition, supervisory relationships, skills and knowledge required, priorexperience required, educational background required, and job side (ifappropriate). Documentation should be provided to assure that staff loanedto the project from other units or agencies will be available for the amountof time required.The narrative must include a brief section describing how staff will berecruited and selected, and whether any particular mix or background, skills,and/or personal qualities is proposed. The relationship or staff characteristicsto the objectives of the demonstration project should be discussed.   Consideration must be given to the use of multidisciplinary staff and staffrepresenting the sexual, ethnic, and cultural characteristics of the populationto be served.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Project Task Plan   </ITAG>The management plan must include a description of tasks to be performed,their sequence, performance schedule, and their relationship to each other.The accomplishment of these tasks should be related to the project goalsand objectives, as well as to the management of the project.
