Orare you a neighborhood chess master?   Bankers Trust may have a job for you.</LP><TEXT>   In a bid to discover new foreign-exchange and bond-tradingtalent, Bankers Trust New York Corp., the U.S.'s 10th-largestbank, is advertising in magazines for chess and bridgeenthusiasts for players who may be interested in turningtheir game skills into cold cash -- for themselves and thebank.   According to the ads, chess and bridge &quot;require certainfinely-honed skills,&quot; among them the ability to predict anopponent's moves, courage to take short-term risks forlong-term gains, and the patience to assess every optionavailable.   &quot;Interestingly enough, these are the exact skillsnecessary to succeed as a trader in the global currency andsecurities markets,&quot; the ad in Chess Life says.   &quot;It doesn't really matter what your background is&quot; the adin Contract Bridge Bulletin emphasizes, &quot;and it could be thebest move you'll ever make.&quot;   Bankers Trust won't talk about how it came to advertisefor chess and bridge players. &quot;We really have nothing tosay,&quot; says a spokesman for the bank. &quot;We've just placed theads and we haven't had any response yet.&quot;   But the ads say that the idea came from several of thebank's best traders, including one highly successful currencytrader who is an international master chess player. &quot;He isstill moving pieces to form a calculated game plan, but nowit is yen and Deutsche marks as well as rooks and knights,&quot;the ad says.   Competitors have mixed feelings about trolling for tradingtalent in hobby magazines. &quot;We just hired some traders, butwe didn't hire them from a bridge club,&quot; says the headcurrency trader at one bank.   But Carmine Rotondo, chief corporate foreign-exchangedealer at Security Pacific National Bank, says good tradershave to keep their wits about them. Bridge players, he says,&quot;tend to be more calm, more acclimated to changingconditions&quot; than other games players, especially gamblers.&quot;You wouldn't want a blackjack player on the desk,&quot; he says.&quot;They tend to self-destruct.&quot;   Yet another currency trader says bridge and chess playersmay be fine, but the people he really wants on his tradingdesk &quot;are the guys that scalp tickets outside the stadium.&quot;   In any event, traders are well rewarded when they producebig profits for their employer. While a trader straight froma bank's training program would probably be paid about$60,000 a year, senior traders with five years or moreexperience earn six-figure salaries with generous bonuses.That's in return for producing $2.5 million or more in annualprofits for the bank.   How much did you make in your last chess match?</TEXT></DOC>
