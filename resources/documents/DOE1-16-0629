The tube structureconsists of an extruded PVC profile (PVC+10% CaCO/sub 3/), shaped asan open 8-cell element where 80 {mu} anode wires are stretched along.All the wires are soldered to the HV connector via damping resistors.A PVC cover is placed on the top of it to close the 8-tube element withthe inner cross section 9x9 mm. Both the top cover and open profile arecoated with graphite paint on the side facing the wires, acting as theresistive cathode of the device. The 8-tube element is inside an extrudedPVC container. External pick-up electrodes (pads) are used to detectinduced pulses, transmitted through the resistive cathode. Most of thetests were made with 1 m long tubes and normally with a gas mixture composedof Ar:C/sub 4/H/sub 10/=1:3. A possible method of improving their operationperformances with the help of an additional ''antistatic'' cover is demonstrated.8 refs.; 19 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
