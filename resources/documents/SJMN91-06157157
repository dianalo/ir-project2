If I thought they had dropped the ball there, I'd sayso.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SHARKS EARN PASSING GRADE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO><TEXT>     The Sharks, who debut in the NHL next season, acquired their first playerslast week, when they participated in a league-wide expansion draft and adispersal draft involving the Minnesota North Stars.;    The consensus of theexperts is that the Sharks need help at the forward positions, but thatGeneral Manager Jack Ferreira was smart to opt for mostly young playersinstead of trying to grab former marquee players who are near the end of theircareers. Of the 34 players on the team's roster, 20 are 23 or younger.;   &quot;It's going to take a little time to develop,&quot; said Craig Ramsay, the BuffaloSabres' assistant general manager. &quot;But I would bet they'll be stronger thanany other expansion team of the past.&quot;;    Many of the Sharks are known forphysical play, and the experts said that will pay dividends during the team'sfirst two seasons, when home games will be played at the Cow Palace in DalyCity. The Cow Palace has a smaller ice surface than most other NHL arenas, soplayers won't have as much room to avoid checks. And the Sharks aren'texpected to be shy about bumping opponents out of plays.;    &quot;You have to beimpressed with their toughness,&quot; said Bruce MacGregor, the Edmonton Oilers'assistant general manager. &quot;They aren't going to be afraid of contact.&quot;;   The Sharks drew additional praise for their goaltending corps, which featuresveteran Brian Hayward (a 140-138-46 career record in nine NHL seasons), formerNew York Islanders prospect Jeff Hackett (the most valuable player of theAmerican Hockey League playoffs in the 1989-90 season), Soviet standout ArturIrbe (a 2.92 goals-against average in 46 games in the Soviet league lastseason) and former Minnesota prospect Jarmo Myllys (24-13-1 last season withKalamazoo of the International Hockey League).;    &quot;At a competitive level,goaltending is where they will be strongest,&quot; Winnipeg Jets General ManagerMike Smith said. &quot;And that's a good place to be competitive.&quot;;    Althoughmost of the team's defensemen are young and have little or no NHL experience,the Sharks do have the potential of eventually having a strong defense,Washington Capitals General Manager David Poile said.;    &quot;They have some verygood defensive prospects. What they could use is more forwards,&quot; Poile said,voicing an opinion echoed by other general managers.;    Ferreira hasattempted to move in that direction by making three trades, sacrificingwingers Tim Kerr, Greg Paslawski and Shane Churla to get winger Brian Mullenand centers Tony Hrkac (pronounced like circus) and Kelly Kisio.;    Kerr, whospent the past 11 seasons with the Philadelphia Flyers and has scored at least50 goals in a season four times, would have been a drawing card for theSharks, but he was traded because he said he had no interest in joining theteam. Experts say Ferreira made a good move in swapping Kerr to the New YorkRangers for Mullen, who has averaged 25 goals and 36 assists in nine NHLseasons.;    Also, Hrkac and Kisio are expected to contribute more offensethan Paslawski and Churla would have.; GRADING THE SHARKS; NHL executivesgrade the Sharks' moves; Subject       Grade Consensus; Strategy      A-   Chose youth over older players; Transactions  Bandplus;    Trades should paydividends; Goaltending   Bandplus;    Brian Hayward heads a strong group; Defense      B-    Loaded with potential; Scoring punch D     Help is needed here  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MIKE WEAVER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910605  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  651  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday June 5, 199100157157,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
