The proposed method easily accounts for partial forced outagerates associated with unit derated states, without any restrictions.The proposed algorithm is applied to typical generating systems includingthe IEEE Reliability TEst System, and the Brazilian South/Southeast Systemplanned for 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
