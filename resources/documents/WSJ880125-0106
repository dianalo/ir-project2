If upheld by the Supreme Court, the strongly-worded decision would almost certainly invalidate some high-profile criminal cases, including the recent perjury conviction of former White House aide Michael Deaver. It also raises questions about whether independent prosecutors named by Attorney General Edwin Meese -- including Lawrence Walsh, who is investigating the Iran-Contra scandal -- have been acting too independently.    The ruling issued on Friday repudiates an effort by Congress after the Watergate scandal to insulate prosecution of high-level government officials from political influence. By a 2-1 vote, the judges said that the controversial 1978 law creating court-appointed prosecutors violates the constitutional separation of powers between the executive and judicial branches of government, usurps the president's fundamental authority to supervise law-enforcement functions and &quot;so jeopardizes individual liberty as to be unconstitutional.&quot;    Mr. Walsh wasn't a party to the case and isn't expected to be affected directly by the ruling. Mr. Meese has given him and some other prosecutors &quot;parallel&quot; appointments so that they could continue working under presidential authority if the idea of court appointments is ruled unconstitutional. But in an unsual aside, the 88-page majority opinion written by Judge Laurence Silberman -- who was nominated by President Reagan -- singled out Mr. Walsh for criticism.    The ruling explicitly challenged Mr. Walsh's view that he may seek indictments if he finds &quot;probable cause&quot; that former Reagan administration officials or others violated the law. &quot;The standard governing United States attorneys' prosecutorial determinations . . . is much higher,&quot; the opinion said, and gives &quot;far greater protection&quot; to targets of criminal investigations.    The discrepancy between the usual standard and Mr. Walsh's more expansive view, according to the ruling, &quot;is inconsistent with the doctrine of a unitary executive&quot; and threatens to make &quot;politically accountable&quot; officials &quot;powerless to affect the independent counsel's choice of the standard for prosecution.&quot;    The court majority pointed out that Mr. Meese &quot;presumably retained the power&quot; to order Mr. Walsh to limit the scope of his investigation. The judges, however, stopped short of saying such a step should be taken.    Steven Ross, counsel for the House, said that such language could influence Mr. Walsh's investigation. &quot;The key to Mr. Walsh's investigation is now in the sole hands of the attorney general,&quot; he said. But Mr. Walsh said, &quot;We don't believe this ruling will affect the continuity of our investigation.&quot;    It is highly likely the Supreme Court will review the ruling, according to Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe and other constitutional experts. The appeals court majority, which went out of its way to rule on all constitutional issues in the case rather than follow the tradition of ruling only on the narrowest point, said it wanted the Supreme Court to have the benefit of its views. The high court would have to give the appeal expedited handling if there is to be a decision this spring. </TEXT></DOC>
