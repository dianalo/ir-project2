Kevin McCue, senior research scientist at the AustralianSeismological Center, said the quake occurred at 6:54 a.m. EDT andmeasured about 7.2 on the Richter scale. The U.S. Geological Surveyput the reading at 8.2.   Alison Clifton, chief of the Australian National AntarcticResearch Expeditions research station on Macquarie, said bytelephone a ``fairly severe'' quake had struck and ``it was prettynoisy.''   ``It was certainly sizable,'' Ms. Clifton said, and rattledbuildings but caused no damage. She said the Macquarie Island baseoften had felt earthquakes, but nothing as strong.   McCue said the quake was the biggest in that part of theundersea Macquarie Ridge since the 1920s and indicated a largemovement at the junction of the Australian and Pacific plates.   He said a stretch of seabed from 30 to 60 miles long and up totwo miles deep apparently had ruptured, with one geological platesliding over another on the same ridge that includes New Zealand.McCue said the quake was too far away to be felt in New Zealand orAustralia.   Undersea earthquakes sometimes result in tidal waves, but McCueand Ms. Clifton said there was no evidence one had occurred.   Macquarie Island, about 850 miles southwest of Christchurch, NewZealand, is uninhabited except for the research station. It isabout 21 miles long and 2 miles wide and is a breeding ground forpenguins, albatrosses and fur seals.   According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the temblor was thestrongest anywhere in the world this year. The last comparablequake was one 8.1 on October 20, 1986, in the Kermadec Islands inthe Pacific, the agency said.   The open-ended Richter scale is a gauge of the energy releasedby an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on aseisomograph.   Each increase of one number, as in magnitude 5.5 to 6.5, meansthe ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of 3.5 can causeslight damage in populated areas and one of 6 can cause severedamage. In March 1964 an earthquake in Alaska of 8.5 killed 114people.</TEXT></DOC>
