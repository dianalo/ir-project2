Rehnquist, as if todeclare himself the man in charge, emerged as the Supreme Court'sdominant force in its just-completed 1987-88 term.   But to do so, the staunch conservative cast some surprisingvotes. They included trimming presidential power through anindependent counsel law, making the CIA more accountable in itsemployment practices and, in a key free-speech dispute, ruling forsex magazine publisher Larry Flynt over evangelist Jerry Falwell.   Rehnquist led the court in each case. He also wrote for thecourt when it upheld a municipal rent-control law and when itstrengthened the right of prison inmates to see documents used intheir prosecution.   A year ago, Rehnquist completed his first term as chief justicewith the knowledge that his leadership had been blunted by thecourt's leading liberal, William J. Brennan.   In the most significant cases, Rehnquist often had been amongthe dissenters as Brennan led the court's majority.   That trend was reversed, and Rehnquist cast fewer dissentingvotes during the 1987-88 term than any court member except JusticeByron R. White, a member of the court's floating center.   But is Rehnquist, long the court's leading champion of thepolitical right, moderating his views?   ``He was carrying the flag (for conservatives) for a long time,and now he's chief,'' said Patrick McGuigan of the conservativeFree Congress Foundation. ``Part of his job now is to count up fivevotes (needed for a majority) and to anticipate outcomes.''   Michael Greve of the conservative Washington Legal Foundationadded, ``He may feel an obligation to be statesmanlike.''   Both men said Justice Antonin Scalia now reigns as the court'smost conservative member.   There is no doubt, however, that Rehnquist remains a coreconservative. For example, he wrote for a 5-4 majority when thecourt ruled that a law providing federal money to religious groupsto discourage teen-agers from premartial sex does not necessarilyviolate the separation of church and state.   From the first Monday in October when Justice Lewis F. Powellretired to Feb. 18, the court was one justice short. JusticeAnthony M. Kennedy, President Reagan's third choice to fill thevacancy, arrived only after the thwarted appointment of Robert H.Bork and the aborted nomination of Douglas H. Ginsburg.   Kennedy participated in 62 of the court's 139 signed decisionsin a term that saw the court, with some notable exceptions,continue its conservative course.   Kennedy's voting pattern already has liberal groups grumbling.In the future, his vote may give the court a solid conservativemajority with those of Rehnquist, Scalia, Justice Sandra DayO'Connor and, in most instances, White.   Brennan's most loyal ally remained Justice Thurgood Marshall,but Justices Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens joined Brennanfar more often than they did Rehnquist or Scalia.
