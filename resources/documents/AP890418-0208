Glenn English, D-Okla.   ``It's the so-called white collar crime. We very likely we couldhave people who were released from a job without beingprosecuted,'' he said.   English chairs the House Agriculture subcommittee onconservation, credit and rural development, which is to find outwhether changes should be made in the CFTC before Congress votes toreauthorize it.   It's the CFTC's job to police the commodity futures exchanges.In the wake of a two-year FBI undercover probe of the ChicagoMercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, members ofCongress have been wondering if the CFTC has been doing its job.   ``Our purpose is to identify weak spots in the system,'' saidEnglish. ``As far as background checks _ that is one weakness wefound today.''   English's comments followed a briefing by congressionalinvestigators who have been looking into the operations of the CFTC.   It was the first in a series of briefings that will be conductedbefore CFTC reauthorization hearings are held.   Staff investigators told the subcommittee that hiring policieson the exchanges vary.   No background checks are conducted at the Kansas City Board ofTrade, the Minneapolis Grain Exchange and the Philadelphia Board ofTrade, said James McDonald, a subcommittee staff member.   ``Each of the three exchanges indicated they conducted aninterview and checked with the references,'' he said.   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange investigates driving records,credit history and previous criminal convictions and verifiesaddresses and social security numbers before hiring anyone intomanagement, accounting, finance and administration, or thepurchasing and security departments.   Hiring at the Chicago Board of Trade is similar, saidcongressional staff member Gwenetta Blackwell, though she noted thepersonnel department there does not check for prior criminalrecords during its background investigations.   Neither exchange has a prohibition against hiring someone with acriminal record, though if the information is known it would not bedisregarded, she said.   To be registered with the National Futures Association, a personmust be fingerprinted and undergo a ``name check'' with theSecurities and Exchange Commission to determine whether there isrecord of any past disciplinary record in the securities industry.   ``NFA does not investigate the individual's employment andeducational history, or credit standing and life style as is donefor security clearance investigations,'' said David Tarosky.   Organizations which must register through the NFA includefutures commissions merchants, introducing brokers, commodity pooloperators, commodity trading advisors, associated persons and floorbrokers.   In upcoming weeks, the subcommittee will be briefed oncompliance and disciplinary actions, trading practices includingdual trading, sales practices, reparations and arbitrations,clearing houses and the status of audit trails and trade timing,with information on technological advances.</TEXT></DOC>
