The regional insurance company estimates that damagessustained from the hurricane will result in total insuredlosses of $4 million to Harleysville Insurance Cos., mainlyin Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Long Island, New York.Hurricane Bob struck the New England coast Aug. 19, withwinds of 115 miles per hour.</LP><TEXT>   The company said its New England unit reported that thevast majority of claims submitted were property losses.Because the claims settle quickly, the company said itexpects the impact of the hurricane to be fully accounted forin the third quarter. So far, 3,850 storm-related claims havebeen processed.   Under its catastrophe reinsurance contracts, Harleysvillecompanies are responsible for the first $4 million of eachcatastrophe and 5% of losses exceeding that. Because itsoverall losses aren't expected to exceed the threshold,Harleysville doesn't expect to collect from its reinsurers.   However, the impact of the loss on the company issubstantially reduced because of an intercompany poolingagreement between Harleysville Group and its affiliate,Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co., to pool all premiums,losses and expenses.   Harleysville Group shares closed at $27.25, up 25 cents,in national over-the-counter trading Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
