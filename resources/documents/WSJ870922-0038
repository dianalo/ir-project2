The late sell-off followed a rumor that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan had called for a lower dollar in a speech. Mr. Greenspan did speak at a seminar sponsored by Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) yesterday, but not until well after the rumors had circulated, and he didn't say the dollar should weaken.    &quot;The biggest excitement of the day is a bust,&quot; James H. Hohorst, managing director, foreign exchange, at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said.    In late New York trading, the U.S. currency stood near the intraday lows it reached earlier in Asian trading. It was quoted at 143.04 Japanese yen, compared with 142.56 late Friday and a day's high of 143.60 yesterday morning in New York. It also stood at 1.8103 West German marks, compared with 1.8065 late Friday and a high yesterday of 1.8152.    The dollar's gains followed news reports from Tokyo quoting unidentified Japanese finance officials as saying the Group of Five nations will renew their commitment to support the U.S. currency through market intervention. Finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the Group of Five will gather in Washington this weekend to attend the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund.    The group, which consists of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and Britain, signed the Louvre accord in Paris in February calling for cooperation in enforcing stability in the foreign exchange markets. Since then, the parties have spent several billion dollars in intervention to support the U.S. currency, and the dollar has remained in a relatively stable trading pattern.    Traders said the currency markets probably will remain sedated until next week, although there is little expectation of any major policy change emerging from the weekend Group of Five meeting.    &quot;The market is comatose ahead of youk-now-what,&quot; Jim O'Neill, financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank, New York, said, referring to the meeting. He said there are two schools of thought about what the session will do. One is that &quot;they are going to come out with some announcement of lowering target zones&quot; for the dollar, which he said &quot;is pretty silly, since they've never admitted having target zones to begin with.&quot; The other, he said, is that they will simply reaffirm the Louvre accord.    &quot;If they just reconfirm the existing accord, that doesn't leave us anywhere different from where we are today,&quot; Mr. O'Neill said.    Mr. Hohorst of Manufacturers Hanover agreed that a policy change regarding the dollar is improbable and said he expects stable currency trading for at least the next month. He said the dollar is supported by strong buy orders below 142 yen and said some dealers predict that the August U.S. trade deficit, to be reported next month, won't be as wide as the record July deficit.    He said there is &quot;a feeling&quot; that some foreign exporters, fearing protectionist legislation in the U.S., &quot;hurried up some shipments&quot; in July. He said the narrowing of Japan's trade surplus for August also suggests an improved U.S. performance.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $4 an ounce to $462.10 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.2 million ounces.    The dollar was quoted at 143.48 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    Gold was quoted at $462.25 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                   Late New York Trading                  Monday, Sept. 21, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
