The moves affect 250 of the long-distance phone company's 12,500 employees, US Sprint said. Jobs of some employees are being eliminated, other employees will be relocated, and still others will report to new supervisors, a spokesman said.    US Sprint is a joint venture of GTE Corp., Stamford, Conn., and United Telecommunications Inc., Kansas City, Mo.    The company said it is adding a layer of management over its seven divisions to get them to concentrate on selling, marketing and providing service to medium-size and large businesses. The divisions will report to three geographically defined Business Markets Groups. Staff functions currently reporting to the divisions will be consolidated into the newly formed Business Markets Groups. David M. Holland, an executive vice president, will be in charge of Business Markets, the company said.    In an effort to boost sales to residential customers and small businesses, the company said it is creating the FON Marketing Group. The new group will report to Edward W. Carter, formerly senior vice president, marketing and sales, who was named executive vice president, sales and marketing.    US Sprint also said it is adding a Midwest division to its National Accounts division because it said it needs more sales people to sell to the nation's 1,000 biggest corporations. A spokesman said revenue from such customers has grown 140% during the past 12 months and US Sprint expects it to grow another 80% during the next 12 months. National Accounts intends to hire more employees, the US Sprint spokesman said, and the company intends to hire additional sales and service representatives in other divisions.    The company also named Fred D. Lawrence, formerly a senior vice president, to the post of executive vice president, network development. Michael Fuller, formerly president of the Southeast division, was named senior vice president, strategic planning and business development, a position that had been open. </TEXT></DOC>
