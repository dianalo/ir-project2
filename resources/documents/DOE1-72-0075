<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-72-0075 </DOCNO><TEXT>Rate constants and product distributions have been determined for gas-phasereactions of ground-state Si{sup +}({sup 2}P) ions with ammonia and theamines (CH{sub 3})/sub x/NH/sub 3-x/ (x = 1-3) at 296 +/- 2 K with theselected-ion flow tube technique. All reactions were observed to be fastand can be understood in terms of Si{sup +} insertion into N-H and C-Nbonds to form ions of the type SiNR{sub 1}R{sub 2}{sup +} (r{sub 1},R{sub 2} = H, CH{sub 3}) proceeding in competition (in the case of theamines) with hydride ion transfer to form immonium ions of the type CH{sub2}NR{sub 1}R{sub 2}{sup +} (R{sub 1}, R{sub 2} = H, CH{sub 3}). C-N bondinsertion appears more efficient than N-H bond insertion. The contributionof hydride ion transfer increases with increasing stability of the immoniumion. The latter reaction leads directly to SiH as a neutral product.Other minor reaction channels were seen which lead directly or indirectlyto SiCH and SiCH{sub 3}. Rapid secondary proton transfer reactions wereobserved for SiNH{sub 2}{sup +} and SiNHCH{sub 3}{sup +} to produce gas-phaseSiNH and SiNCH{sub 3} molecules. With methylamine SiNH{sub 2}{sup +}also appears to produce H{sub 2}SiNH{sub 2}{sup +} which may deprotonateto form the simplest silanimine, H{sub 2}SiNH, or aminosilylene, HSiNH{sub2}. Reactions of this type are of interest in molecular synthesis andhere are proposed to contribute to the formation of SiH, SiCH, SiNH,SiCH{sub 3}, and H{sub 2}SiNH or HSiNH{sub 2} in partially ionized interstellargas clouds containing silicon, ammonia, and methylamines.</TEXT></DOC>
