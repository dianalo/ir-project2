This energy storage capability has numerous applications,many of which are sensitive to frictional and thermal losses which occurduring the charge/discharge cycle. Under some conditions, the magnitudeof these losses can be quite high. The thermal loss is caused by variationsin the gas temperature during compression and expansion and is highlydependent upon the cycling rate. Experimental data show that the thermalloss can be minimized by inserting elastomeric foam in the gas-side ofthe accumulator. This study reports experimental data taken with an 8.185-liter(2.162-gallon) piston-type hydraulic accumulator. Measured accumulatorefficiencies are presented and the effect of holding time, prechargepressure, rate of charging and discharging, and foam mass on the thermalloss and accumulator efficiency are discussed. Frictional and thermallosses are quantified for this accumulator and their relative magnitudesare determined. For this accumulator, foam insertion improved the efficiencyby as much as 60%.</TEXT></DOC>
