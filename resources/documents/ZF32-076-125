(choosing and using type fonts in WordPerfect)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Goldsmith, Vern.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>The impact a document has on readers is heavily influenced by thefonts that are used.andP;  Type fonts are stored in three ways and thebehavior of a font is changed depending on where it is stored andhow it is accessed.andP;  Resident fonts are the basic fonts that comewith the printer.andP;  Some laser printers now come with scalablefonts, but most printers have a limited number of typefaces.andP;  Softfonts are software usually purchased on a floppy disk and loadedinto the hard drive for storage.andP;  They are either bitmapped or inoutline form.andP;  Bitmapped typefaces can be of the highest quality,although smaller sizes need fine tuning.andP;  Users who need smalltype should check print quality before buying a bitmapped font.andO;Scalable outline fonts are flexible but are cumbersome, slow anduse a lot of memory.andP;  Printer cartridges may be either bitmappedor scalable outline fonts and are either fixed, modular or custom.andO;Cartridges are the best solution for networked printers.andO;PostScript capability is no longer limited to PostScript printers.andO;Controller cards can give non-PostScript printers PostScriptcompatibility, but they are expensive.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   WordPerfect (Word processing software) (Computer programs).andO;Topic:     GuidelinesFontsSoftware PackagesSoftware Selection.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Anyone who's ever created a document wants the printed result to reflect theeffort that went into it.andP;  Document appearance depends greatly on the fontsused.andP;  However, font technology for laser printers has evolved into acomplex, often confusing realm.andP;  You're presented with a variety of choicesrather than a single all-purpose solution.andM;Theoretically, characters printed in the same font and size will beidentical.andP;  In practice, fonts often behave differently based on how they goton the page.andP;  There are important performance differences between a soft fontand a cartridge font that produces &quot;identical&quot; printed characters.andM;One aspect that differentiates fonts is where they're stored in your system.andO;Some fonts are stored in your printer (resident fonts), some are your harddrive (soft fonts), while others are stored in cartridges that are insertedinto your printer (cartridge fonts).andP;  Knowing where each type of font isstored and how it makes its way to the printed page makes it easier tovisualize what's going on.andP;  Here's an overview of several popular fonttechnologies ranging from the most basic to the most sophisticated:andM;Resident fonts are the standard fonts built into your printer.andP;  In the past,these fonts provided only the basics.andP;  They were few in number and their sizeand typeface were fixed.andP;  They were intended to provide you with some verybasic printing capability until you could decide which font additions youwanted.andM;This bare-bones approach from printer manufacturers is changing.andP;  Many of thenewest laser printers have scalable resident fonts.andP;  The size of scalable oroutline fonts can be changed at will.andP;  You can do a lot with even one or twotypefaces, if you can vary their size at will.andM;Soft fontsandM;Soft fonts are so named because they're stored as software.andP;  They can resideon floppy or hard disks, or in memory.andP;  They're usually purchased on a floppydisk, copied onto and stored on a hard drive, then downloaded into printermemory at printing time.andP;  Soft fonts are available in two basic flavors: inbitmap form or as outlines.andM;Bitmap fonts are defined (and printed) as a collection of tiny adjacentdots--similar to filling in squares on graph paper to form letter shapes.andO;Every character size and shape is formed by a different number andarrangement of these dots.andP;  All the characteristics of bitmapped fonts(including size) are fixed when you buy them.andP;  What's on the disk is what youget.andP;  This limitation also provides their greatest potential advantage--highquality.andM;The laser printing process can produce some unpredictable results when fontsare printed at smaller sizes.andP;  To compensate for the way heated toner flowson paper during the printing process, bitmapped fonts can be hand-tuned toimprove quality at small sizes.andP;  This tuning process is done by the fontvendor, and not all bitmapped fonts have been enhanced this way.andP;  You shouldcheck and compare print quality yourself.andM;Outline or scalable fonts exist as a collection of mathematical formulas thatdescribe the shape of each character.andP;  By simply varying trhe formula, thesize of these fonts can be changed at will.andM;Some outline fonts are designed to be scaled by special software and storedas bitmaps on your hard drive.andP;  These fonts can deliver characters of almostany size.andP;  However, this flexibility comes at a price.andP;  Creating bitmap fontsfrom the outlines is a long and sometimes complicated process.andP;  Bitmap softfonts hog space on your hard drive, require time for downloading, use printermemory once they arrive at the printer and need to be added to yourWordPerfect printer definition.andM;Some outline fonts can be scaled on-the-fly.andP;  That is, they're created onlywhen they're needed.andP;  Since one set of mathematical formulas is used togenerate all sizes of the font, disk storage requirements are minimal.andP;  Somenew versions of scalable fonts scale only the specific characters needed fora print job--not the whole character set.andP;  This reduces downloading time andthe amount of printer memory required--thus overcoming two majordisadvantages of soft fonts in bitmap form.andM;Font cartridgesandM;As their name implies, cartridge fonts are introduced into your printer asplug-in cartridges.andP;  Fonts are stored in the cartridges as either bitmaps orscalable outlines.andP;  Because they're stored in the cartridge at the printerand require no downloading, these fonts are fast.andP;  Also, they require verylittle or no computer or printer memory.andP;  They're easy to use--and theeasiest of any font solution to install.andM;Font cartridges have been around for a long time as a way to expand thecapabilities of laser printers.andP;  They've evolved to the point that todaythere are several subcategories of font cartridges available:andM;Fixed cartridges were the first type developed, and are still popular.andO;Originally they contained bitmapped fonts in sizes and typefaces determinedby the vendor.andP;  Bitmapped fonts in fixed cartridges are usually hand tuned toproduce excellent quality.andM;Recently several vendors introduced scalable fonts in cartridges.andP;  Thesefonts don't offer quite the same quality in small sizes as tuned bitmappedfonts, but offer much greater flexibility.andM;Neither type of fixed cartridge can be customized or expanded, but in manyenvironments this isn't a problem.andP;  The only significant disadvantage ofeither of these cartridges is that they hold a limited number of fonts--andthese fonts are chosen by the vendor.andP;  Higher-capacity cartridges have gone along way toward solving this kind of limitation.andM;Modular cartridges are a recent development in cartridge technology.andP;  As withfixed cartrdges, their design begins with a rather large base collection offonts contained in a master cartridge.andP;  Expansion modules can then be pluggedinto this master cartridge.andP;  In addition to fonts, the modules can containlogos, signatures, letterhead, etc.andP;  The vendor chooses the base fontcollection, but you choose the rest.andM;Custom cartridges were introduced by vendors who specialized in providinglarge organizations with the exact fonts they wanmted.andP;  There are at leasttwo situations that call for custom fonts: When you want to select the fontsand character sets for your company's cartridge, and when you need to matchan existing font.andM;The same fonts from different vendors can have different character widths.andO;This means that line and page endings could change if character widths aren'tmatched exactly.andP;  Vendors of custom cartridges can not only give you thefonts you want, but give them to you with the character widths you need.andM;In addition to normal fonts, your custom cartridges can also contain companylogos, signatures, letterhead, bar codes, etc.andP;  Most anything that can beprinted can be included in these cartridges.andM;Keep in mind, however, that custom cartridges are usually not supported byWordPerfect.andP;  Make certain the cartridge vendor supplies the drivers you needfor all your applications.andM;PostScriptandM;Many printer manufacturers have developed their own page descriptionlanguages--sets of instructions that control all aspects of printing a page.andO;Two page-description languages (PDLs) dominate the desktop market today: PCLfrom Hewlett-Packard and PostScript from Adobe Systems.andP;  Most laser printersuse or emulate one or both of these standards.andM;Fonts are in important piece of PostScript technology.andP;  Traditionally,PostScript printers are bundled with a basic set of 35 outline/scalablefonts.andP;  Other fonts can be added to the basic collection.andP;  AlthoughPostScript offers many other features, for most users its name is synonymouswith scalable fonts.andM;PostScript capability was traditionally built into the printers themselves.andO;These printers were more expensive than similar printers without PostScript.andO;More recently we've seen PostScript either emulated in software within thecomputer or moved to a cartridge inserted directly into non-PostScript laserprinters.andM;PostScript had only two disadvantages: It was slow and it was expensive.andO;Technology is addressing the speed problem and competition is reducingprices.andM;Controller cardsandM;Within the last few years, special controller cards have added newcapabilities to many standard laser printers.andP;  These sophisticatedcontrollers are often installed in your computer to take advantage of somefeatures of its high-speed processing environment.andP;  Controller cards can alsobe installed in the printer itself.andP;  These controllers typically offerincreased printing speed, on-the-fly font scaling, special effects and--mostimportant--high resolution printing from standards 300 dpi laser printers.andO;Resolutions of 800-1000 dpi from 300 dpi printers are not uncommon.andM;Most of these controllers support WordPerfect and offer printing featuresthat fall midway between typical laser printers and typesetters.andP;  They areavailable in both PostScript-compatible and non-PostScript versions--and mostprovide output that is compatible with typesetters.andM;Every day thousands of PCs are added to networks to share resources and makeexchanging data easier.andP;  The combined printing needs of multiple users on anetwork almost always exceed the capabilities of the resident fonts in aprinter.andP;  This leaves soft fonts, font cartridges, PostScript and controllercards as possible network printing solutions.andM;If you need the quality and flexibility offered by PostScript and controllercards, and can justify their price, both are excellent network solutions.andO;PostScript, however, can be slow on a network unless you have a printer withlots of horsepower.andP;  If your needs don't justify this expense, you mustchoose between soft fonts and cartridges.andM;Soft fontsandM;For users of stand-alone PCs, soft fonts can be an acceptable, if sometimescumbersome, solution.andP;  However, when several PC users are moved to networks,soft font performance is seriously degraded.andP;  A single user can downloadfonts once each day.andP;  But because different users on a network need differentfonts, downloading is likely to be necessary each time a user prints a job.andO;This happens because the previous print job used different fonts.andP;  Networkprinting solutions demand maximum flexibility and speed to deal with thecombined needs of many users.andM;CartridgesandM;Cartridges solve the downloading problem on networks, provide excellentquality and speed, are easy to install and are easy to use.andP;  In almost allnetwork environments, cartridges are preferable to soft fonts.andM;Buying fontsandM;When you investin any font technology, getting what you need is imperative.andO;You should also anticipate your future needs and the direction in whichtechnology will move.andP;  None of us knows where we will be in five years, buttrying to visualize where we're going tomorrow can help us make betterdecisions today.andM;If you buy a PostScript printer, your font environment is determined for you.andO;When you buy a non-PostScript printer, you should consider one that leaves asmany options as possible open for the future.andP;  Choose a model that hasoutline resident fonts and can be upgraded by adding a PostScript cartridgeor controller card.andM;Adding fonts to existing systemsandM;If you want to add fonts to an existing system, first learn all you can aboutyour options from your dealer or printer manufacturer.andP;  They can tell youwhether your printer supports PostScript cartridges, controller cards or fontcartridges.andP;  They can also help you identify a selection of vendors for fontproducts that are compatible with your system.andP;  Another important source ofinformation when considering a font purchase is WordPerfect Customer Support.andO;They can tell you which font packages are compatible with WordPerfect.andM;The recent explosion in the number and variety of font products addscomplexity to the decision process.andP;  The good news is that there are now manyexcellent choices instead of just a few.andP;  &quot;What you want is what you get&quot; isgetting closer to being a reality--and at prices you can afford.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
