Box 96456, Room 2525-S,Washington, DC 20090-6456, telephone: (202) 475-3919.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The final rule is issued under MarketingAgreement and Marketing Order No. 917 (7 CFR part 917) regulating the handlingof fresh pears, plums, and peaches grown in California. The order is effectiveunder the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C.601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' rule undercriteria contained therein.Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act(RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) hasconsidered the economic impact of this proposed rule on small entities.The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatability.There are approximately 45 handlers of California pears under this marketingorder, and approximately 300 pear producers in California. Small agriculturalproducers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR121.2) as those having annual gross revenues for the last three years ofless than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined asthose whose gross annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majorityof the handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.Marketing Order 917, administered by the Department of Agriculture (Department),requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year shall applyto all assessable pears handled from the beginning of such year. An annualbudget of expenses is prepared by the Committee and submitted to the Departmentfor approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and producers ofthe regulated commodity. They are familiar with the Committee's needs andwith the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local areas,and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The 1989-90budget was formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directlyaffected persons had an opportunity to participate and provide input.The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividinganticipated expenses by expected shipments of the commodity (36-pound cartonor equivalent). Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it mustbe established at a rate which will produce sufficient income to pay theCommittee's expected expenses. The budget and rate of assessment were recommendedby the Committee after the season began, and expenses are incurred on acontinuous basis. Therefore, the budget and assessment rate approvals mustbe expedited so that the Committee will have authority to incur reasonableexpenses and have funds to pay its expenses.The Committee met on June 28, 1989, and unanimously recommended 1989-90fiscal year expenditures of $912,390 and an assessment rate of $0.22 per36-pound carton or equivalent of assessable pears shipped under M.O. 917.For comparison, 1988-89 fiscal year expenditures were $698,719 and theassessment rate was $0.22 per carton or equivalent.The major expenditure item this year is $733,800 for advertising, promotion,and food safety compared to $556,737 in 1988-89. The remaining expenses,which are primarily for program administration, are budgeted at about lastyear's amounts. A total of $10,000 is included for uncollected assessmentaccounts.Estimated total income for 1989-90 will amount to $800,060, including assessmentincome of $786,060 based on shipments of 3,573,000 cartons of fresh pears,$2,000 from the California Department of Food and Agriculture, and $12,000from other sources such as interest earned on the reserve fund. The reservefund of $249,095 would be sufficient to cover the anticipated deficit.Notice of this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 20, 1989 (54 FR 30392). Comments wereinvited until July 31, 1989. No comments were received.While this action would impose some additional costs on handlers, the costsare in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additionalcosts may be passed on to producers. However, these costs would be significantlyoffset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order.Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this actionwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities.After consideration of all relevant information provided including theCommittee's recommendation, and other available information, it is foundthat this final rule will tend to effectuate the declared policy of theAct.This final rule should be implemented promptly because the Committee needsto have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuousbasis. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommendedby the Committee at a public meeting. Therefore, it is found that goodcause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (5 U.S.C. 553). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 917</ITAG>California, Marketing agreements and orders, Peaches, Pears, Plums.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, andSection; 917.253 should beadded as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> This section will not be published in the annual <T3>Code of Federal Regulations.</T3></ITAG>1.
