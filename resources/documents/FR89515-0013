Program Description</ITAG>The purpose of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (the Act), Title IIIof the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, is to provide financialassistance to establish or strengthen community-based centers designedto address the immediate service needs of runaway and homeless youth andtheir families. The mandated services are temporary shelter, crisis intervention,counseling, and aftercare follow-up. The law mandates that grantee organizationsbe outside the law enforcement structure and the juvenile justice system.The statute also contains a provision for technical assistance and short-termtraining to grantees.Entities eligible for grants are: States, localities, private for-profitand private non-profit agencies, and coordinated networks of such agencies.In fiscal year 1988, OHDS funded 327 centers, nine regional coordinatednetworks (one network is providing services to two regions) and the NationalCommunications System (National Runaway Switchboard). The Department ofHealth and Human Services (DHHS) estimates that over 340,000 youth andtheir families received services under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Programduring FY 1988.This Act was originally authorized as Title III of the Juvenile Justiceand Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 and was amended by the JuvenileJustice Amendments of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-509), the Juvenile Justice Amendmentsof 1984 (Pub. L. 98-473), and the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Pub. L.100-690).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Purpose of the Final Rule</ITAG>The Runaway and Homeless Youth Program is administered by the Family andYouth Services Bureau of the Administration for Children, Youth and Families(ACYF) in OHDS. This office is revising its existing Runaway and HomelessYouth Program regulations at 45 CFR Part 1351, last published on November28, 1978 (43 FR 55634), in order to clarify the match requirements forgrants awarded under this program and to make technical and editorial changesto comport with changes in the language of the statute, as amended.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary of Amendments to the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act andChanges Proposed in This Final Rule</ITAG>A. The 1980 Amendments The 1980 amendments to the Act made several changes. The title of the Actwas modified to include homeless youth; the title is now the ``Runawayand Homeless Youth Act.'' The National Communications System (NationalRunaway Switchboard) which assists runaway and homeless youth in communicatingwith their parents and with service providers was authorized. A formulafor equitably distributing the program funds among the States was alsoestablished. The States receive allocations based upon their respectivepopulations of youth under 18 years of age (based on the latest data fromthe Census Bureau). The amendments also added the opportunity for the familiesof runaway and homeless youth served by the centers to receive assistanceto meet their immediate needs related to runaway episodes. Based on these amendments, we are proposing to change the title of 45 CFRPart 1351 to the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program and add the words ``andhomeless'' after the word ``runaway'' whenever it appears in the rule.B. The 1984 Amendments The 1984 amendments broadened the eligibility for assistance under theAct to allow private, profit-making as well as non-profit entities andcoordinated networks of such entities to receive grants. Section 366(d),formerly section 331(c), stipulates that no funds appropriated to carryout the purposes of this title may be used for any program or activitywhich is not specifically authorized by Title III; or may be combined withfunds under any other Act unless such funds are separately identified inall grants and contracts and are used for the purposes specified in thistitle. Based on the 1984 amendments, we are proposing to delete all referencesto the term ``non-profit'' as an organizational status requirement foreligibility under this program. C. The 1988 Amendments The 1988 amendments provide for the implementation of transitional livingservices for homeless youth when the Title III appropriation reaches thefull authorization level; the specification of funding levels for the NationalCommunication System; and the annual publication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of a proposed plan specifying the subject prioritiesthe Secretary will follow in making grants for each fiscal year. Theseamendments require no change in the regulations. D. Other Changes In addition, questions have been raised over the past several years regardingsection 362, formerly section 318 of the Act, and how the required matchis computed. We are taking advantage of this final rule to clarify thatthe grantee must provide a non-Federal share equal to at least 10 percentof the Federal funds requested under the Act. This is not a change in policy.Finally, we are taking this opportunity to make technical and editorialchanges and to change the language referring to ``parent,'' ``parents,''and/or ``legal guardian'' to ``family'' or ``families'' to comport withthe addition of these words throughout the statute. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Waiver of Notice and Comment Procedure </ITAG>This rule is being published as a final rule because it contains purelytechnical changes generally reflecting statutory language and will notrequire any new action on the part of the grantees under the program. Accordingly, the Secretary has determined that it would be unnecessaryto use the notice and comment procedures in issuing these regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Impact Analysis </ITAG>Executive Order 12291 Executive Order 12291 requires that a regulatory analysis be prepared formajor rules, which are defined in the Order as any rule that has an annualeffect on the economy of $100 million or more, or certain other specifiedeffects. Since nothing in the NPRM is likely to have an effect on the economyof $100 million, the Secretary concludes that this regulation is not amajor rule within the meaning of the Executive order. Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C., Ch. 6) requires the Federal governmentto anticipate and reduce the impact of rules and paperwork requirementson small businesses. For each rule with a ``significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities'' an analysis must be prepareddescribing the rule's impact on small entities. Small entities are definedby the Act to include small businesses, small non-profit organizations,and small entities. While these regulations would affect small entities,these changes are technical and editorial in nature. For this reason, theSecretary certifies that these rules will not have a significant impacton a substantial number of small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-511, all Departmentsare required to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview and approval any reporting or record keeping requirement inherentin a proposed or final rule. This final rule does not contain informationcollection requirements or increase Federal paperwork burden on the publicor private sector. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 45 CFR Part 1351 </ITAG>Youth, Administrative practice and procedure, Social service program, Technicalassistance, Reporting requirements.
