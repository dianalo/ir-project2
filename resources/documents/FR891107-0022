Background</ITAG>On July 22, 1987, the President signed into law the Stewart B. McKinneyHomeless Assistance Act (the ``McKinney Act''), Public Law 100-77. Thisrule implements section 441 of the McKinney Act, which authorizes the section8 Moderate Rehabilitation Assistance Program for Single Room OccupancyDwellings for Homeless Individuals.A notice was published on January 9, 1989 (54 FR 769) announcing the availabilityof a $45 million appropriation under the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment-Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1989 (Pub. L. 100-404,approved August 19, 1988). The January 9 notice set forth the requirementsgoverning the use of the funds made available in that fiscal year. A priornotice of funding availability was published in Fiscal Year 1988 (52 FR38380, October 15, 1987), which governed the use of those funds providedin that fiscal year.The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988 (Pub.L. 100-628, approved November 7, 1988) (the ``1988 Amendments'') made additionalprogram changes, which were reflected in the January 9 notice and whichare discussed further below, regarding (1) the use of efficiency units,(2) a definition of ``major spaces'', (3) an annual adjustment of the costlimitation per unit, and (4) responsibility for environmental reviews.The 1988 Amendments also required the Department to implement the requirementsby notice within 60 days of enactment and by regulations within 12 months.The notice published on January 9, 1989 complied with the first half ofthe mandate; however, in order to meet the second half, the Departmentsolicited public comments on the January 9 notice, and a 60 day commentperiod was afforded the public. A discussion of the comments received andthe disposition of those comments is contained elsewhere in this preamble.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. This Rule</ITAG>Under the program, HUD enters into annual contributions contracts (ACCs)with public housing agencies (PHAs) in connection with the moderate rehabilitationof residential properties in which some or all of the dwelling units maynot contain either food preparation or sanitary facilities. (The inclusionof efficiency units was added by the 1988 Amendments and is discussed furtherbelow). Each of these single room occupancy (SRO) units is intended foroccupancy by one eligible homeless individual. The limitation of occupancyto one eligible individual is a Housing Quality Standard (HQS) requirementdeveloped by the Department to implement section 8(n) of the U.S. HousingAct of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437f, which first allowed the use of section 8Moderate Rehabilitation assistance for SRO units.Assistance under section 441 of the McKinney Act may only be provided forSRO units occupied by homeless single ``individuals'' (section 441(b)).In this respect, section 441 differs from all other section 8 and PublicHousing programs under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as well asfrom all of the other homeless assistance programs under the McKinney Act.For other section 8 or Public Housing programs, HUD is authorized to provideassistance for ``families'' (see U.S. Housing Act of 1937, <T3>passim</T3>) and a single individual may qualify as a statutory ``family''only in specific circumstances defined in the law (U.S. Housing Act of1937, section 3(b)(3)). For the other McKinney Act programs, assistanceis made available for homeless families. By contrast, section 8 SRO assistanceunder section 441 may not be used for housing occupied by a multi-person``family'', and may only be used for assistance to single individuals.The legislative history indicates clearly the Congressional intention thatassistance under section 441 may only be used for single individuals, andmay not be used for multi-person families, or families with children. Thelegislation authorizing section 8 moderate rehabilitation assistance forSRO units originated in the Senate. An explanation of the bill (insertedin the record by Senator Cranston) states that the Section 8 assistancefor SRO dwellings is intended to meet the housing needs of ``elderly, handicappedor displaced single individuals'' (133 Cong. Rec. S 4816).In the bill introduced in and originally passed by the Senate, the authorizationof section 8 moderate rehabilitation assistance for SRO units was pairedwith a separate proposed authorization of section 8 certificate funding``to assist homeless families with children.'' (The proposed authorizationto assist homeless families with children was at section 404(a) of theSenate bill (H.R. 558 as amended by Senate substitute); the authorizationto assist single individuals in SRO dwellings was at section 404(b) ofthe bill.) In conference on the McKinney bill, the subsection to provideassistance for homeless families with children was dropped (presumablybecause assistance for such families is authorized under other sectionsof McKinney); the provision of assistance for individuals in SRO housingwas retained, and enacted as section 441 of the McKinney Act. This historyshows that section 441 was not intended to provide assistance for familieswith children, but to meet the special housing needs of isolated individuals.Section 8(n) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f) authorizesthe Secretary to waive (1) the 15 percent limitation on the number of unitsunder the jurisdiction of any PHA that can be occupied by ``other singlepersons'' (those who do not qualify as elderly, displaced, or the remainingmember of a tenant family), and (2) the preference for persons who areelderly, handicapped, or displaced over other single persons. (See sec.3(b)(3), U.S. Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(3)). The Departmentbelieves that waiver of the limitation and preference is appropriate forthis program. Many of those who will occupy the SRO housing assisted underthis program would not be subject to the 15 percent limitation (becausethey are elderly, displaced, or the remaining member of a tenant family)and, therefore, would probably qualify for the preference. In light ofthe administrative burden involved for those few who may be subject tothe 15 percent limitation, the Department waives these provisions for purposesof this program. Accordingly, the selection of tenants is not subject tothe statutory percentage limitations on the number of units that may beoccupied by single persons other than the elderly, handicapped, or displaced,nor is tenant selection for SROs subject to the preference for elderly,handicapped, or displaced single persons over other single persons. Thewaiver of these provisions is set forth in andSection; 882.809. (A conformingregulatory change regarding this waiver is also set forth in an amendmentto andSection; 812.3.)If, after appropriate outreach efforts by the PHA and the Owner, thereare insufficient eligible homeless individuals to fill all assisted units,the Owner may rent them to eligible non-homeless individuals.Amounts made available through this program must be allocated by HUD onthe basis of a national competition to the applicants that best demonstratea need for the assistance and the ability to undertake and carry out aprogram to be assisted under this rule. No single city or urban countryis eligible to receive more than 10 percent of the assistance being madeavailable.Under this program, HUD will provide assistance for a 10-year period. Thestatutory allocation procedures established for the program by section441 apply instead of the ``fair share'' allocation procedures requiredfor most assisted housing funds by section 213(d) of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 1439(d).A notice of funding availability for the program will be published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>, each fiscal year or as often as is needed, announcingthe availability of funds and inviting PHAs to submit applications forthe program. Applications shall contain the information prescribed in andSection;882.805(c) and any other information prescribed in the Notice. The Noticewill also provide additional information on the HUD selection process,including how applications will be ranked. The Notice will include specificinformation on when and to whom applications are to be submitted. HUD Headquarterswill process all applications and select the successful PHAs.A PHA which is selected will execute an ACC with HUD. The ACC shall befor a term of eleven years (thus allowing for one year to place the unitsunder a Housing Assistance Payments Contract (HAP Contract) and a 10-yearassistance period under the HAP Contract). The ACC will give HUD the optionto renew the ACC for an additional 10 years, subject to the availabilityof appropriations.Before the Owner begins any rehabilitation, the PHA and the Owner mustenter into an Agreement to Enter into Housing Assistance Payments Contract(Agreement). After completion of rehabilitation, the PHA and the Ownerwill enter into a Housing Assistance Payments Contract. The HAP Contractmust be entered into within 12 months of execution of the ACC and willhave a 10-year term.Under the original Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program for SingleRoom Occupancy Dwellings for Homeless Individuals, the total cost of rehabilitationthat may be compensated through Contract Rents under a HAP Contract couldnot exceed $14,000 per SRO unit (including a pro rata share of the costrelated to common areas). This limit could be adjusted in certain circumstances.Further discussion of the cost limitation is set forth below under thediscussion of the changes made by the 1988 Amendments. (There is no limitationon the cost of rehabilitation under the regular Moderate Rehabilitationprogram.)Under this rule permanent displacement is prohibited. The Department believesthat a project that cannot be rehabilitated without permanently displacingtenants should not be provided with assistance, and has prohibited suchassistant in andSection; 882.803(d). However, in the event there is a waiverof this prohibition or a violation of this prohibition, there is a cross-referencein andSection; 882.803(d) to the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real PropertyAcquisition Policies Act of 1970.This rule makes applicable many of the regulations for the current ModerateRehabilitation Program in 24 CFR part 882, subparts D and E, and refersto other regulations in title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Sectionreferences to HUD regulations are to title 24. The term ``family'' as usedin 24 CFR 812.2 shall be understood to refer to an individual for purposesof the Moderate Rehabilitation SRO Program.The 1988 Amendments made the following changes to the SRO Program. (Thesechanges were reflected in the January 9, 1989 notice of funding availability.):(1) SRO assistance may now be used in connection with the moderate rehabilitationof efficiency units, if the owner agrees to pay the additional costs ofrehabilitating and operating the units. This amendment is evidenced inthis rule by permitting, under andSection; 882.803(b) Housing Quality Standards,an SRO unit that may contain both food preparation and sanitary facilities.However, in no case may the fair market rents for SRO units be exceeded.(That fair market rent is 75 percent of the 0-bedroom Moderate Rehabilitationfair market rent.)(2) A definition of ``major spaces'' is provided in connection with fireand safety improvements and is set forth to mean ``hallways, large commonareas, and other areas specified in local fire, building, or safety codes.''This definition is contained in this rule under andSection; 882.803(b) HousingQuality Standards.(3) HUD is required to increase the per unit cost limit each year to takeinto account increases in construction costs, starting with assistanceprovided on or after October 1, 1988. For purposes of Fiscal Year 1989funding, the cost limitation was raised from $14,000 per unit to $14,300per unit to take into account increases in construction costs during thepreceding 12-month period. (Future cost limitation changes will be establishedby publication of a Notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.)(4) Under section 104(g) of the Housing and Community Development Act of1974, 42 U.S.C. 5304 (the ``1974 Act''), funds may be released for particularprojects to recipients of CDBG assistance under title I of the 1974 Actwho assume all of the responsibilities for environmental review, decisionmaking,and actions under the 1974 Act. Section 482(a) of the 1988 Amendments statesthat ``the provisions of, and regulations and procedures applicable under,section 104(g)'' of the 1974 Act shall apply to assistance and projectsunder title IV of the McKinney Act. This gives HUD the discretion to applythe environmental review procedures of section 104(g) and its implementingregulations at 24 CFR part 58 to the section 8 Moderate RehabilitationSRO program.In all the programs to which section 104(g) (other than those in titleIV of the McKinney Act) applies, the recipients of assistance are jurisdictionswith general purpose powers. Although a small minority of PHAs are agenciesof general local government, the majority do not possess general purposepowers. The Department believes that the existence of such powers_especiallypowers relating to land use control_is an important element in a recipient'sability to carry out the status of a ``responsible Federal official'',within the meaning of section 104(g). Clearly, most PHAs do not possessthese powers and would be unable successfully to carry out these environmentalresponsibilities.Thus, for purpose of this rule, the Department will not provide for assumptionof environmental review responsibilities by PHAs, but will carry out thesefunctions itself. (This decision applies to all PHAs, even if they possessgeneral governmental powers.) In the Department's view, the relativelysmall number of PHAs that have these powers does not justify operatinga dual system for environmental review for the program.In developing a final rule for this program, the Department specificallyrequested in the January 9 notice comments on the following alternativeproposals for handling environmental reviews for this program in the future:(a) HUD to continue to conduct the environmental reviews for all recipientsunder this program, or(b) Units of general local government that operate as PHAs to assume responsibilityfor conducting their own environmental reviews, with HUD continuing toconduct the reviews for all other PHAs. No comments were received on thisissue or on the alternatives presented. The Department will continue toconduct the environmental reviews for this program as discussed above.(5) Section 401 of the McKinney Act prohibits assistance under the ModerateRehabilitation SRO Program from being made available within the jurisdictionof a State, or a metropolitan city or urban county that is eligible fora formula allocation under the Emergency Shelter Grants program establishedby the McKinney Act (ESG formula city or county), unless the State, city,or county has a HUD-approved Comprehensive Homeless Assistance Plan (CHAP).If the structure containing an SRO unit to be assisted under this programis located within an ESG formula city or country, the city or county musthave an approved CHAP. If the structure is located outside an ESG formulacity or county, the State must have an approved CHAP. Since Indian tribesare not required to have approved CHAPs, the CHAP requirement does notapply to an Indian Housing Authority established by exercise of a tribe'spowers of self-government independent of State Law. Section 401(f) providesthat in an area covered by a CHAP, an application for homeless housingassistance (under title IV of the McKinney Act, including Moderate RehabilitationSingle Room Occupancy Assistance under section 441) must contain a certificationfrom the official who submits the CHAP that the proposed assistance isconsistent with the CHAP. The certification requirement is set forth underandSection; 882.805(c)(7) of this rule.Section 402 of the 1988 Amendments require CHAPs to contain an assurancethat each grantee, recipient, and project sponsor (as appropriate) willadminister, in good faith, a policy designed to ensure that the homelessfacility is free from the illegal use, possession, or distribution of drugsor alcohol by its beneficiaries. SROs under this program are homeless facilitiesfor this purpose and, therefore, subject to CHAP requirements regardingdrug- and alcohol-free facilities as set forth in section III.4 of theCHAP notice published on December 28, 1988 (53 FR 52600).This rule follows the requirements of the notice of fund availability publishedon January 9, 1989, with the exception of: (1) The expansion of eligibilityto participate at andSection; 882.805(c)(9) to PHAs that are not currentlyadministering a Moderate Rehabilitation program, as discussed further underPublic Comments, and (2) the additional requirement at andSection; 882.805(c)(5)that applicants submit information regarding their experience in workingwith homeless people.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comments</ITAG>As discussed above, the 1988 Amendments required the Department to implementits requirements by notice within 60 days of its enactment and by regulationswithin 12 months. The notice published on January 9, 1989 complied withthe first half of the mandate; however, in order to meet the second half,the Department solicited public comment on the notice, and a 60-day commentperiod was afforded the public.The Department received eight public comments from: Two local housing authorities,a county multi-service center, a mayor of a city, a State representativeto a State legislature, a State department of community development, acounty government, and a private citizen. All commenters raised essentiallythe same objection_that the program was limited to public housing agenciesthat are currently administering a Moderate Rehabilitation program under24 CFR part 882. Accordingly, the final rule does not contain that restriction,and all PHAs are permitted to submit applications. (This change was implementedby a revised notice of fund availability published on April 18, 1989, at54 FR 15560.)<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Other Matters</ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42U.S.C. 4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for publicinspection weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. in the Office of the RulesDocket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing andUrban Development, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC20410.This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulations issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. An analysis of the rule indicates thatit does not (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), theUndersigned hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it provideshousing for homeless individuals through a housing assistance mechanismthat is already established between HUD, the PHA, and the Owner under thesection 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program.Executive Order 12612, FederalismThe General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of theExecutive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies containedin this rule do not have federalism implications and, thus, are not subjectto review under the Order because the rule merely provides, at statutorydirection, housing for homeless individuals through a housing assistancemechanism that is already established between HUD, the PHA, and the Ownerunder section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program.Executive Order 12606, the FamilyThe General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,the Family, has determined that this rule does not have a potential significantimpact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being and, thus,is not subject to review under the Order, because its aim is to providesingle room housing for homeless individuals.This rule was listed as item 1058 in the Department's Semiannual Agendaof Regulations published on October 30, 1989 (54 FR 44702, 44723) in accordancewith Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number is 14.156, LowerIncome Housing Assistance Program.Information Collection RequirementsThe collection of information requirements contained in this rule havebeen submitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 and have been assigned OMB control number 2502-0367.A new information collection requirement has been added at andSection; 882.805(c)(5)relating to the applicant's experience in working with homeless people.Information on these requirements is provided as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Tabulation of Annual Reporting Burden Final Rule_Section </T4>8<T4> Moderate Rehabilitation Program for Single Room Occupancy Dwellingsfor Homeless Individuals</T4><H1>Description of information collection </H1><H1>Section of 24 CFR affected </H1><H1>No. of respondents </H1><H1>No. of responses per respondents </H1><H1>Total annual responses </H1><H1>Hours per response </H1><H1>Total hours</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Section 8 moderate rehabilitation program for single room occupancydwellings for homeless individuals (2502-0367) <D>24 CFR 882 </D><D>150 </D><D>1 </D><D>150 </D><D>25.5 </D><D>3,825</D></ITAG></ITAG>Accordingly, chapter VIII of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulationsis amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 812_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

(g) <T3>Initial contract rents.</T3> Section 882.408, Initial Contract Rents(including the establishment of fair market rents for SRO units at 75 percentof the O-bedroom Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent), shall applyto this program, except as follows: (1)(i) In determining the monthly cost of a rehabilitation loan, in accordancewith 24 CFR 882.408(c)(2), a loan term of a least 10 years (instead of15 years) may be used. The exception in 24 CFR 882.408(c)(2)(iii) for usingthe actual loan term where the total amount of the rehabilitation is lessthan $15,000 shall continue to apply. In addition, the cost of the rehabilitationthat may be included for the purpose of calculating the amount of the initialContract Rent for any unit shall not exceed the lower of (A) The projected cost of rehabilitation, or (B) The per unit cost limitation that is established by <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notice, plus the cost of the fire and safetyimprovements required by andSection; 882.803(b)(2).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"> HUD may, however, increase the limitation in paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) of this section by an amount HUD determines is reasonable and necessaryto accommodate special local conditions, including high construction costsor stringent fire or building codes. Future cost litigation changes willbe published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> in the Notice of Funding Availability issuedeach year. (ii) Where the FHA believes that high construction costs warrant an increasein the per unit cost limitation in paragraph (g)(1)(i) (B) of this section,the PHA shall demonstrate to HUD's satisfaction that a higher average perunit amount is necessary to conduct this program and that every appropriatestep has been taken to contain the amount of the rehabilitation withinthe published per unit cost limitation established at that time, plus thecost of the required fire and safety improvements. These higher amountswill be determined as follows: (A) HUD may approve a higher per unit amount up to, but not to exceed,an amount computed by multiplying the HUD-approved High Cost Percentagefor Base Cities (used for computing FHA high cost area adjustments) inuse before April 1988, for the area, by the current published cost limitationplus the cost of the required fire and safety improvements. (B) HUD may, on a structure-by-structure basis, increase the level approvedin paragraph (g)(1)(i) to up to an amount computed by multiplying 2.4 bythe current published cost limitation plus the cost of the required fireand safety improvements. (2) In approving changes to initial Contract Rents during rehabilitationin accordance with 24 CFR 882.408(d), the revised initial Contract Rentsmay not reflect an average per unit rehabilitation cost that exceeds thelimitation specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. (3) Where the structure contains four or fewer SRO units, the Fair MarketRent for that size structure (the Fair Market Rent for a 1-, 2-, 3-, or4-bedroom unit, as applicable) shall be used to determine the Fair MarketRent limitation instead of using the separate Fair Market Rent for eachSRO unit. To determine the Fair Market Rent limitation for each SRO unit,the Fair Market Rent for the structure shall be apportioned equally toeach SRO unit. (4) Contract Rents shall not include the costs of providing supportiveservices, transportation, furniture, or other non-housing costs, as determinedby HUD.
