We have not talkedto the kidnappers,'' Reagan said shortly after arriving here on apolitical trip.   ``I think maybe Iran is putting these stories out,'' he added.   The report, in the month-old Israeli weekly The Nation, saidthat in exchange for the releases, beginning in about a week,Washington will provide economic aid, gradually release billions ofdollars in Iranian funds frozen in U.S. banks and resume diplomaticrelations with Tehran.   The newspaper, quoting unnamed sources, said the United Statesand Iran had been negotiating directly on the matter since Mondayin Geneva. The hostages are believed to be held by pro-IranianShiite Moslems.   Flying here from Washington, presidential spokesman MarlinFitzwater told reporters on Air Force One:   ``There have been no face-to-face negotiations. There havealways been third-party contacts, but there have been no talks thatwe directed or we participated in. ...   ``The problem is, I cannot account for other people who may havebeen talking to Iran ... (but) in the sense of the word (that) weasked somebody (to talk for the United States), the answer is no.''   The spokesman said that ``there is no one authorized to make adeal for hostages or do anything that is contrary to our policy.... We're always ready to talk at authorized levels. We make nodeals.''</TEXT></DOC>
