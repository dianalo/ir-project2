The increased fiscal 1991 funding for the Pentagon is thelargest component, but the postwar jockeying has alreadydrawn diverse constituencies ranging from interestsrepresenting drought-stricken wildlife in California to thepro-Israel lobby seeking $1 billion in emergency assistancefor the Jerusalem government.</LP><TEXT>   At the request of the Bush administration, the DesertStorm funding measure will be considered first. It includesmoney not only to cover the cost of the conflict but also toredeploy the forces now in the Persian Gulf. The $43 billionin new spending, approved by the House Appropriations defensesubcommittee yesterday, would be financed largely by promiseddonations from such allies as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, butincludes a $15 billion down payment from the U.S.   Approximately half of the increased funding would go tocover the initial buildup and to maintain the current forcelevels through March 31. Redeployment is expected to costanother $5.2 billion, according to Pentagon estimates, and $7billion is provided to give the administration more leeway astroop levels are scaled back to the lower ceilings demandedin last fall's budget agreement.   The most sensitive -- and controversial -- accounts arethose directly dealing with the added cost of the war itselfand which weapons must be procured to maintain adequatestocks. While cutting back on the Pentagon's request, theHouse panel approved an estimated $3.2 billion in newprocurement, and $6 billion more was set aside as a downpayment on the still vaguely defined cost of the six-weekwar.   Faced with future cuts, weapons contractors such as TexasInstruments Inc. and Raytheon Co. used their influence toobtain appropriations for the HARM and Patriot missiles,respectively. The panel added funds to buy an estimated 500of the upgraded and more expensive versions of the Patriotair-defense missiles from Raytheon -- many more than werefired in the war -- while the Pennsylvania delegation addedlanguage on behalf of Textron Inc.'s V-22 Osprey rotor-wingaircraft.   The Pentagon reportedly slashed its own procurementrequest -- initially $6.4 billion -- shortly before thesubcommittee meeting. And with the war largely over, someanalysts argue that Congress shouldn't rush ahead with newmoney until a more complete appraisal can be made of themilitary's needs. In much the same way, the $6 billionappropriated to cover the added costs of combat is based on acrude $150 million-a-day cost estimate, but the committeeleadership appeared frustrated later in spelling out wherethe money will go.   The rush to spend is explained partly by the fervor of thewar but also the rules of last year's budget agreement, whichexempts Desert Storm costs from the ceilings on defensespending. Neither side in the debate truly knows how themilitary will fare in the end, but the Pentagon's allies inthe appropriations process will be reluctant to miss anyopportunity to build a cushion for the future.   Though dwarfed by the Desert Storm expenditures, asupplemental bill covering various law-enforcement, veteransand energy accounts will be considered as well by the fullHouse Appropriations Committee Tuesday.   In action this week, Housing and Urban DevelopmentSecretary Jack Kemp was rebuffed in his bid to shift fundsinto newly authorized tenant and home-ownership programs.However, the Energy Department won approval of $340 millionin additional funds to clean up nuclear-weapon plants.Increased operating funds for the department's controversialRocky Flats plutonium plant in Colorado were cut in half byRep. David Skaggs (D., Colo.), and California's delegationadded $30 million elsewhere to Bureau of Reclamation accountsin connection with the state's drought.   The same measure includes assorted &quot;emergency&quot; items --such as added expenditures for the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation -- related to the Gulf crisis, and Israel hasrequested almost $1 billion itself to help offset the addedmilitary costs it incurred during the war. Secretary of StateJames Baker met yesterday with the House bipartisanleadership on the issue, and though noncommittal, he is understrong pressure from Republicans in the Senate to back theIsraeli request as a justified &quot;emergency&quot; exempt from thebudget ceilings.   Wisconsin Sen. Robert Kasten, one of the younger faces inthe GOP leadership, is a strong ally of Israel, and Sen. PhilGramm (R., Texas), chairman of the Senate GOP campaigncommittee, is increasingly active as well.   Mindful of the odds against him, Mr. Baker appears mostintent on winning some understanding of what future demandswill come from pro-Israel interests. While the administrationmay yet back the current request, the secretary will want tomaintain some leverage in his own negotiations in the regionand he may seek some promise that other concessions -- suchas housing guarantees -- will be put off in this fiscal year,which ends Sept. 30.</TEXT></DOC>
