Malodorous ethers rise from itsbanks.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's big,&quot; says a spokesman for Kuwait Oil Co., &quot;but farfrom the biggest.&quot;   This is one of hundreds of oil lakes that now dot theKuwaiti desert, formed by spilled crude from the nation's 732Iraqi-sabotaged oil wells. The oil that hasn't burned orevaporated has flowed, sometimes in virtual rivers, into anenvironmental nightmare rivaling the nation's oil fires.   One giant oil lake alone covers 14 square miles of desert.Official estimates indicate up to 75 million barrels lie inlakes throughout Kuwait. One U.S. consultant who has flownover the lakes says 150 million barrels would be a reasonableestimate. Much of the oil is thought to be salvageable --though the longer it sits, the less salvageable it becomes.   And while more than a third of Kuwait's burning wells havebeen snuffed out, not one oil lake has been drained. Kuwaitoil officials say preoccupation with the oil fires hasprecluded quicker action. Now, they hope to launch a 100-daycleanup effort to rid the desert of its lakes.   Some scientists, pointing to the multiple hazards posed bythe lakes, find the delay another example of the inefficiencythat has gripped Kuwait's reconstruction effort. Theircriticism comes amid revelations that numerous U.S. concerns,with the expertise and equipment to handle the problem, havebeen in Kuwait since April attempting to persuade oilofficials to award contracts.   That such work hasn't already begun is &quot;appalling,&quot; saysCharles Pilcher, a medical researcher and Kuwait resident whohas also carried out pioneering desert-ecology studies here.   Surface evaporation from the lakes adds tons of noxiousvapors to Kuwait's already badly polluted air. The morevolatile light gases from fresh oil have begun to ignitespontaneously under scorching desert temperatures, framingmany lakes in rings of unearthly fire. Fumes from those&quot;light ends,&quot; as they are called, contain known carcinogens.   Even the lakes' less volatile weathered crude -- now toosludgy to ignite spontaneously -- could be set alight bysabotage or by accident.   Birds have begun to mistake the oil lakes for real ones,flying into certain death. British ornithologists randomlysurveying a small oil lake near Kuwait's northern coastlinecounted 250 oily bird carcasses along its perimeter.   Before the end of this month, millions of birds will beginswarming the northern Arabian skies in their seasonalsoutherly migration. For these birds, the lakes are likely toturn into traps, says David Sexton, a scientist withBritain's Royal Society for the Preservation of Birds.   &quot;There will be a whole lot of young birds on their firstmigration, and they are likely to be especially attracted tothese lakes,&quot; Mr. Sexton says.   The cleanup, when it is finally launched, will resemble inscale the huge, costly efforts needed to bring a major newoil field into production. The oil will be sucked from thelakes by large portable pumps, then either cleaned up byportable filtering units or pumped directly to coastalstorage tanks where it can be stripped of impurities infacilities to be constructed on site.   To get the collected oil into Kuwait's existing pipelinesystem will require construction of 40 to 70 miles ofconnector pipelines. And because the amount of oil easilyoverwhelms Kuwait's storage capacity, engineers say they willhave to build one or more huge open-storage pits at Kuwait'soil-export terminal near Ahmadi, 20 miles south of KuwaitCity.   These pits will hold the filtered oil only long enough forit to be pumped aboard a fleet of giant tankers that willserve as a more permanent home until the oil can be sold torefiners world-wide.   &quot;There simply isn't enough storage to hold all this oil incountry,&quot; says a consultant for Al-Awda, a Kuwait Oil unitthat will be supervising the cleanup.   What sort of market this oil finds, and what price itfetches, remain to be seen. Preliminary sampling indicatesthe oil &quot;has commercial value&quot; -- though far less than the$20 a barrel that untainted Kuwaiti crude would normallyfetch, the AlAwda consultant adds.   The light ends -- chemical components that allow oil to berefined into gasoline and other consumer products -- &quot;havelargely evaporated,&quot; says one U.S. oilman who has sampledcrude from a number of lakes. And the longer it weathers,&quot;the less you are able to do with it from a refiner's pointof view.&quot;   Kuwait Oil's cleanup plan is motivated as much bycommercial concerns as environmental ones. By November, thecountry is subject to its first winter rains, which couldsend vast amounts of water and sediment into oil alreadyfouled by sand and debris.   Some oil experts, however, doubt that the project can becompleted so quickly. As long as there are uncontrolled wellsgushing oil in the Kuwaiti desert, lakes will continue togrow, or new lakes will form. And under the most optimisticscenario, the intensive firefighting and well-capping effortsnow under way won't be completed until March.   Even if the oil stopped flowing tomorrow, the existinglakes pose a daunting challenge, given the logisticalproblems and obstacles involved. Most of the lakes sit inKuwait's vast Burgan Field, south of Ahmadi, wherefirefighters are just beginning to extinguish hundreds ofburning wells.   Conditions are grim. The air reeks of burning andevaporating oil. Visibility is poor as oil smoke chokes outsunlight most of the day. Trucks and heavy equipment trudgeat school-zone speeds, lights on, along access roads that areoccasionally overrun by the growing lakes of oil.   Burgan perhaps is one of the more heavily mined of the oilfields sabotaged by the Iraqis. It will require painstakingmine-sweeping efforts to gain access to some of these lakes.And there is the likelihood that mines and unexplodedordnance left over from the Gulf War lie in the lakes orunder the lakebeds, posing hidden hazards to cleanup crews.   &quot;I guarantee you,&quot; says another U.S. oil expert who hasvisited the lakes, &quot;that this job will be just as dangerousas putting out the fires.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
