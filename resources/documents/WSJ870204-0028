Recent calls for a more vigorous public health policy to track and curtail the spread of the fatal epidemic have drawn fire from the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, which predict testing would lead to loss of privacy, jobs or insurance for the ill and the infected. Currently, testing for the presence of AIDS antibodies in the blood is required only for blood donors.    The proposal is to be discussed at a meeting in Atlanta Feb. 24 and 25 sponsored by the centers, the U.S. Public Health Service's national agency for control of infectious and other preventable diseases. Even if approved following the meeting, the AIDS-testing proposal wouldn't be binding unless adopted by states.    So far, about 30,000 cases of AIDS-acquired immune deficiency syndrome have been diagnosed in the U.S., with an estimated 300,000 cases of AIDS-related complex, and another 1.5 million to 2 million people believed infected but symptom-free. The viral disease, which strips the body of immune defenses, is spread by sexual contact, blood products and contaminated needles. Although homosexuals and intravenous drug abusers so far account for the majority of those diagnosed with the disease, AIDS now is spreading fastest among heterosexuals.    &quot;We're not talking about a gay disease here, we're talking about a sexually transmitted disease,&quot; said Walter Dowdle, the agency's head of AIDS activities. Dr. Dowdle said in an interview that increased public awareness of heterosexual transmission is spurring demand for more vigorous testing and prevention. &quot;There's an evolution in our thinking,&quot; he said. &quot;Things are possible now that weren't possible before. As the epidemic expands, there's a different sense of urgency.&quot;    Last year, the Atlanta-based agency recommended routine AIDS testing at venereal-disease and drug-abuse clinics, as well as prenatal testing for women at high risk. But Dr. Dowdle hinted the new recommendations may include a proposal for &quot;a more routine (prenatal) procedure so one doesn't have to second-guess whether one is at high risk.&quot;    Ideally, he said, this would be done well before conception, at the time of application for a marriage license. But he also acknowledged that that proposal may not be effective for some members of high-risk groups, because &quot;many mothers wouldn't present themselves until they were already many months into their pregnancy.&quot;    Recently, James Curran of the national agency complained that few public health agencies acted on last year's recommendation to perform testing at VD and drug clinics. Now, Dr. Dowdle said, &quot;We're both expanding the recommendations, and addressing them in an expanded forum to see if we can develop a consensus.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
