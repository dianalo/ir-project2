Thewaste products from these operations include general uncontaminated scrapand refuse, contaminated and uncontaminated metal scrap, waste oils,low-level radioactive waste, co-contaminated wastes, mixed waste, toxicwaste, sludges from water treatment, and fly ash from the steam plant.This material is estimated to total more than 350,000 cubic meters. Otherwastes stored in this area include laboratory chemicals and other combustiblematerials in the burn pit; fine waste stream sediments in the clear well;fly ash and waste oils in the two fly ash areas; lime-alum sludges andboiler plant blowdown in the lime sludge ponds; and nonradioactive sanitarywaste, construction rubble, and asbestos in the sanitary landfill. Asystematic survey of the surface soils throughout the Waste Storage Area,associated on-site drainages, and the fly ash piles was conducted usinga Field Instrument for Detecting Low-Energy Radiation (FIDLER). Uraniumis the most prevalent radioactive element in surface soil; U-238 is theprincipal radionuclide, ranging from 2.2 to 1790 pCi/g in the generalWaste Storage Area. The maximum values for the next highest activityconcentrations in the same area were 972 pCi/g for Th-230 and 298 pCi/gfor U-234. Elevated activity concentrations of Th-230 were found alongthe K-65 slurry line, the maximum at 3010 pCi/g. U-238 had the highestvalue of 761 pCi/g in the drainage just south of pit no. 5. The upperfly ash area had the highest radionuclide activity concentrations inthe surface soils with the maximum values for U-238 at 8600 pCi/g, U-235at 2190 pCi/g, U-234 at 11,400 pCi/g, Tc-99 at 594 pCi/g, Ra-226 at 279pCi/g, and Th-230 at 164 pCi/g.</TEXT></DOC>
