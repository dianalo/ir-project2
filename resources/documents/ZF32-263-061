 In that spirit, we reprint the following, editedslightly, with full attribution to the author: Eugene Stollberg, chairman ofTor, a Leningrad co-operative working closely with Raima Corporation ofBellevue, WA.andP;  We have seen no better or more heartfelt analysis of thedamage caused the software industry by the Soviet Union's lack of a marketsystem.andP;  The Soviet market has good potential; however, it's not clear how tomake it work.andP;  We have a shortage of computers with almost no real domesticmanufacturing, but we have millions of people and specialists in the computerindustry and a great amount of industrial facilities which are being usedwith confusing inefficiency.andP;  Many skilled programmers' and engineers, groupswere hidden in large state enterprises and had no opportunity to offer theresults of their activity to the market.andP;  We have a very poor system oftechnical and business information.andM;So the problems are high and global and I think we cannot solve them withoutthe West and its help.andP;  our present computer boom (the computer business inthe USSR provides exchange rates between rubles and dollars higher than anyother field of activity) indicates that it's high time to get to work.andP;  ... andO;The price of a pc database in the US is approximately 0.2-0.3 of aprogrammer's monthly salary.andP;  Using the present market exchange rate, we pay3 or more years of a qualified programmer's salary for the same product inthe Soviet Union.andP;  I think this is the real reason that most Sovietprogrammers use stolen copies.andP;  They are not evil men by nature, but if theyare forced to buy for such prices they will go out of business immediately.andO;The second problem is that Soviet programmers don't feel themselves to beindependent software manufacturers that have to respect the economic rightsof their peers.andP;  They aren't used to selling their products so they don'tunderstand why they need to buy software instruments.andP;  When Steve Smith fromRaima Corporation entered our office in Leningrad he saw Norton Commander onthe screen of the nearest computer and asked whether we bought it.andP;  Ouranswer was honest and negative.andP;  What a pity,&quot; Steve said, &quot;if you send himsome money maybe he will write new programs for you.&quot; Such a conscience isyet unusual for most Soviets.andP;  I think that Western software manufacturersand sellers need to work out a special promotion strategy in the USSR.andP;  Maybeit will be useful to propose to current Soviet users to register theirillegal copies (deleting non-used copies) and then to legalize copies in useby paying a reasonable fee.andP;  Such a fee might be different depending on someconditions (receiving documentation, support, etc.).andP;  For instance, rublepayments could go to a special foundation for software business promotion inthe USSR, for business-center construction, for translation and publicationof documentation in Russian, or for computer magazines and advertising.andP;  Theowners of the software paid for have no real way to use such ruble funds eachseparately, but this foundation could benefit them all together in the USSR.andO;A sufficient amount of rubles might be convertible efficiently into assetsreally valuable for Western partners, such as goods, buildings and businessfacilities.andP;  Stanching the brain drain One more problem.andP;  We have a big armyof relatively cheap programmers and the West has a shortage of suchspecialists.andP;  The standards of living are so different that the brain drainis becoming a problem for us.andP;  However, it may be more beneficial for theWest to give us orders to develop software here and to invest money in oursoftware business, than to pay labor and social insurance costs for a massimmigration of programmers into Western countries.andP;  Payment in hard currency,and the opportunity to travel and participate in projects, job training,seminars and conferences in the West, are good alternatives to theinconveniences of leaving our native country.andP;  Certainly nobody pretends toforce people to live here or there, but in any case we should offercounterbalanced alternatives.andP;  I think it's high time to choose a group ofindependent Soviet software manufacturers and to provide them the supportnecessary to make them really useful for the Western market, both as softwaredevelopers and buyers for the West, and as distributors and dealers for theEast.andP;  One form of such aid is assistance in management, marketing and salesorganization in our software companies.andP;  During our visit to the US werealized that we had good programmers but no real practice in such things assales, marketing and project organization.andP;  I think that the best form wouldbe short- and medium-term training in US software ventures.andP;  Practical workinside American business is the only way to get real business skills.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
