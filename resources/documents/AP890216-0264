IBM said the static random access memory (SRAM) chip was for fastmachines such as mainframes and supercomputers that need to storeinformation in memory banks and retrieve it at high speeds.   The chip was discussed in New York at the International SolidState Circuits Conference, the world chip industry's biggest annualresearch meeting. A day earlier, Intel Corp. unveiled what it calledthe world's fastest microprocessor, the central control chip in acomputer.   IBM said its chip can store 128,000 bits of information and hasfeatures as small as half a micron across. One micron isone-hundredth the width of a human hair.   On Wednesday at the conference, Texas Instruments Inc. announcedan SRAM chip that is slightly slower but holds eight times as muchinformation.   SRAM chips are faster but more expensive and have less capacitythan the more common memory chips known as dynamic random accessmemories, or DRAMs.</TEXT></DOC>
