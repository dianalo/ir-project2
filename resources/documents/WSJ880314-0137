Albert Gore loads every circuit in a presidential campaign that resembles a political light show of Democratic ideas.    Without changing his views, he changes his emphasis with rhetorical strokes that evoke all that the party has been and hopes to be. First, he's the rock 'em-sock 'em populist; then he stands in the cooler hues of what he calls the &quot;politics of the future.&quot; Gray images of old Democratic heroes -- of Harry Truman and a hawkish John Kennedy -- seem to light the stage behind him as he next steps into the bright promise of a &quot;new generation of leadership&quot; coming to power.    &quot;The stakes have never been higher,&quot; he tells cheering Illinois Democrats. Super Tuesday made the young Tennessean an instant contender. But with the spotlight turned on him, he now is scrambling without any natural base to match his rivals in the North.    Gov. Michael Dukakis has money and entree to urban, ethnic enclaves. The Rev. Jesse Jackson rides on the shoulders of black voters in Chicago and other northern cities. Mr. Gore must live by his wits, and his best hope is to define the debate in which he and his rivals will be judged.    He casts himself as the moderate alternative to Mr. Jackson and Mr. Dukakis, but then comes at the Massachusetts governor from both the right and left. Mr. Gore's record on foreign policy and arms control reflects more knowledge and conservatism than Mr. Dukakis has so far shown. In fiscal matters, he's less experienced than the governor, but he presents himself as the more passionate ally of working-class voters in a fight against what he calls &quot;the rich and powerful.&quot;    If Mr. Dukakis offers voters a sense of discipline, Mr. Gore's strength is his curiosity. He always seems to be learning, and his success owes much to a restless intellect that gives him a greater flexibility. He draws on history for a richer message than the governor has yet voiced. His campaign tactics challenge the conventional wisdom of past presidential races, and he claims a place on the cutting edge of change and the future.    &quot;I think he did the one thing he needed to do,&quot; says Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster. &quot;He shifted the focus of the campaign, the ideological ground, the economic ground, and the question of change vs. status quo.&quot;    To prove his success, Mr. Gore now must show that he can win in the North. His campaign doesn't expect to capture many votes here in Illinois, but after sitting out most early primaries and caucuses before Super Tuesday last week, the senator can't afford to pick and choose anymore. He sees potential in Mr. Dukakis's neighboring state of Connecticut on March 29, and the New York and Ohio primaries in April and May are areas where he hopes to do well as he builds toward California in June.    To compete requires money, though. Mr. Gore's late surge in the South owed much to his heavy investment in television. In South Carolina, where he invested much less, he finished far behind Mr. Jackson in caucuses Saturday. Monied southerners will give more after the success of Super Tuesday, and he is meeting with California fund raiser Duane Garrett in hopes of gaining his help.    Increased attention from the media may bring a closer look at the shifting themes in Mr. Gore's own campaign. He has borrowed from his rivals in shaping his message, but his congressional record plays a part in that message, too. Mr. Gore began the race reminding each voter of his position on the Senate Armed Services Committee alongside conservative Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn. Then, in the final weeks before Super Tuesday, he went back to his record in the House as a young muckraker and legislator on environmental, consumer and science issues.    He took working-class voters away from his rival, Rep. Richard Gephardt, and won the largest proportion of those Democrats who previously had voted for Ronald Reagan. His clearest weakness was among women voters; it still isn't certain if his renewed emphasis on health and children's issues will soften that opposition, spotted in exit polling last week.    &quot;I think I have found my voice,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't think Mike Dukakis has found his.&quot;    The senator can't say the same of Mr. Jackson, though. As much as Mr. Gore wants a clear shot at the governor, he can't have that field alone if he continues to finish behind Mr. Jackson. His advisers speak of casting Mr. Jackson and the governor as twin examples of the failed &quot;politics of the past,&quot; but the history-making quality of the Jackson candidacy makes this difficult. &quot;That's a phrase that has limited utility,&quot; Mr. Gore concedes. &quot;I think they're very different.&quot;    Mr. Jackson stirs a passionate commitment that Mr. Gore can't rival. As a candidate, the senator is much more at ease with himself than he was a few months ago, but he remains a man more of ideas than of experiences that enable him to connect with voters. Part of this is his youth -- he will be only 40 this month -- and part may be the same curiosity that led him to divinity and law school without completing either.    He never immersed himself like his House classmate Rep. Gephardt in the institutional struggles of Congress, and though he unfailingly mentions his tour in Vietnam, he rarely speaks to voters of his experiences there. In a recent appearance at a Veterans of Foreign Wars post in Florida, his candidacy touched a chord among men who had also served in the war, yet Mr. Gore appeared hesitant in how to respond to the emotions shown.    He reaches back to the history of the South when he speaks of the nation's ability to change itself, but here too, he seems to set himself apart.    He recalls vividly his father's campaign for the Senate in 1952, when Mr. Gore was four years old. Yet in describing the segregation in the South in the same period, he takes a step back.    &quot;I remember reading in books about the signs in the South that said colored only, white only,&quot; he tells an audience of Democrats here. &quot;I remember being shocked and horrified and angered and outraged and amazed when I saw those pictures.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
