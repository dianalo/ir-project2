But NCNB, before yesterday, hadn'tindicated whether the discussions could translate into a bid.   NCNB, whose stock is more than 50% higher than at year-end1990, said it was required to disclose that it has been in&quot;preliminary discussions&quot; with Southeast about buying thetroubled bank because of disclosure laws related to such SECfilings.   An individual familiar with the matter said NCNB isexpected to decide soon whether it will go after Southeast, a$12.6 billion-asset institution that has the largest marketshare in Dade County. Such an acquisition would sharplyincrease NCNB's market share in attractive Florida marketsbut would also saddle it with a large portfolio of bad loans.   As of March 31, Southeast had nonperforming assetstotaling $776 million. NCNB's nonperforming assets stood at$1.03 billion.   Southeast currently has 34.3 million common sharesoutstanding. Its shares closed yesterday at $5.75 a share,off 25 cents, giving it a total market capitalization ofabout $197 million.   In its statement, NCNB, which is the nation'sseventh-largest bank holding company with $66 billion inassets, said &quot;there are no assurances&quot; that it will bid forSoutheast. NCNB further qualified its announcement, noting itisn't able to determine whether Southeast would accept anoffer and that the terms and the timing of a transaction withSoutheast as well as the probability of its being completedremain uncertain.   Southeast declined to elaborate on its earlierconfirmation that it is in talks with several institutions.   NCNB said proceeds of the stock offering would be used forgeneral corporate purposes, possible additional contributionsto the capital of subsidiaries, or possible acquisitions ofother financial institutions or their assets, includingfailed institutions.   NCNB, which has 103.2 million shares outstanding, said 8.5million shares will be offered in the U.S. and 1.5 million inEurope. Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. is lead underwriter in theoffering.</TEXT></DOC>
