Uno, who took office just a week ago, denied the report, but itspublication broke a long-held code of silence in the Japanese newsmedia about publishing or broadcasting reports on such liasons bygovernment officials.   It is not unusual for Japanese men, especially if they arewealthy, to keep mistresses, while their wives are expected toremain faithful.   Shuntaro Torigoe, the magazine's editor in chief, said hepublished the article because he wanted to bring issues of socialethics into the public arena.   ``We also want Americans, who are critical of politicians, toknow that in Japan we are changing,'' he added.   The story generated about 100 telephone calls to the magazine'soffice in four days. Some 80 percent of the callers supported theMainichi's decision to publish the story, while the rest objected tothe story as a violation of Uno's privacy.   Sunday Mainichi quoted the woman as saying Uno had paid her300,000 yen ($2,100) a month over a four-month period in 1985. Themagazine said it did not identify her by name at her request. Itsaid she was 40 years old. Uno is 66.   ``He is not a man of noble character,'' the article quoted thewoman as saying. ``I don't want him to use politics the same way hetreated me.''   Geishas are women highly trained in music, dance and makingconversation. While they are not prostitutes, some develop intimaterelationships with customers who become their patrons.   While most major newspapers and television networks avoided theUno-Geisha story, some of Japan's sensationalist tabloids comparedit to the sex scandal involving Democratic presidential aspirantGary Hart in the United States.   ``If it happened in the United States he would have to go,'' theDaily Gendai said of Uno.   Uno was named prime minister June 2 after a long search for ascandal-free politician to replace the tainted administration ofNoboru Takeshita, who resigned to take responsibility for a massiveRecruit bribery scandal.   The geisha story is the only blemish so far in Uno's case.   He denied the liason with the geisha.   ``It's out of the question,'' Uno told the Tokyo Shimbun.   Although the magazine is a Sunday publication it has been onnewsstands since Monday.   Uno has not been asked about the article during question periodsin the Diet, Japan's parliament.   Kuniko Inoguchi, a professor of political science at SophiaUniversity, said that in the past 15 years keeping mistresses hascome to be considered against the social ethic.   ``If you are in a prestigious position in politics or business,you have to be clean both with money and with sex,'' Ms. Inoguchisaid. ``It's now part of the general code of conduct.''   But she added that the Recruit scandal, in which a conglomerateallegedly sought to buy favors from politicians and bureaucrats withcut-rate stocks and political donations, may have worn the Japanesedown.   ``Now that the Recruit scandal has come to an end, people mightbe a little tired of picking on politicians right now,'' she said.   Takako Doi, the chairman of the opposition Japan Socialist Partyand the most powerful woman in politics, refused to comment on thereport.</TEXT></DOC>
