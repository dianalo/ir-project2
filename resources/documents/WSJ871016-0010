Squeezed into 20 crates, the birds took up most of the seats and spilled into the restroom. After the flight, the plane had to be fumigated. Mr. McMillan had volunteered the space to a wildlife group that wanted to replenish the island province's pheasant flock.    Such an episode isn't unusual for the 42-year-old Mr. McMillan, a committed environmental spokesman who will soon become a more familiar figure in the U.S. as he leads a new Canadian government offensive against acid rain. Acid rain has been a source of friction between the two countries for years, and Mr. McMillan -- advocating a &quot;massive effort to influence U.S. public opinion&quot; -- has embarked on a series of trips speaking to U.S. groups and universities.    Canada asserts that much of its acid rain -- precipitation with a high concentration of acids -- is the byproduct of pollution that spews from tall smokestacks of coal-burning power plants in the Ohio Valley. Carried by prevailing winds into the northeastern U.S. and Canada, it is blamed for damage to fish, wildlife, forests, buildings and even human health. Canada itself has already moved to curb acid rain from smelters and factories within its borders.    For years, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative government tried to coax the Reagan administration to do something to solve the problem, and the usually outspoken Mr. McMillan kept silent. Now, frustrated with what it sees as U.S. foot-dragging, the Mulroney government is taking a harder line. Unleashed, Mr. McMillan has lately begun angering Reagan administration officials, some congressmen and others with his criticisms.    Earlier this year, for example, Mr. McMillan called &quot;colossally stupid&quot; a suggestion by Interior Secretary Donald Hodel that Canada's push for acid-rain controls was a ruse to clear the way for Canadian utilities to sell more electricity to the U.S. Then he dismissed as &quot;voodoo science&quot; a U.S. interagency report last month that suggested acid rain wasn't as hazardous as previously thought. This prompted U.S. Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to assail Mr. McMillan's &quot;caustic remarks.&quot;    Mr. McMillan, who hands out red-and-white umbrellas emblazoned with &quot;Stop Acid Rain,&quot; is now planning a U.S. advertising campaign, aimed at, among others, U.S. tourists who vacation on Canadian lakes. He has doubled his acid-rain communications budget to 850,000 Canadian dollars ($650,000) and is seeking more funding.    Brian Day, spokesman for the U.S. Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental group, agrees that Mr. McMillan's direct approach to the public and Congress will be more successful than earlier Canadian initiatives, which even included hiring former White House aide Michael Deaver as an acid-rain lobbyist.    A veteran environmental activist who has battled Canadian corporations, municipalities and environmental groups, Mr. McMillan &quot;goes for the jugular,&quot; says Colin Isaacs, head of a Toronto-based environmental group.    Last year, Mr. McMillan accused Irving Oil Co., a large eastern Canadian oil company, of being either incompetent or deceitful in handling an oil spill. Irving cleaned up the spill. He also charged that leaders in St. John's, Newfoundland, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, allowed their harbors to become &quot;open sewers&quot; through discharges of untreated waste. Halifax and other east coast cities started sewage projects.    But some environmental groups say he talks a better game than he plays. Mr. Isaacs, for instance, dismisses an environmental protection bill that Mr. McMillan introduced in June with considerable fanfare as just a &quot;housekeeping&quot; measure that consolidates existing law. Kenneth Brynaert, executive vice president of the Canadian Wildlife Federation, says that what Mr. McMillan has done mostly has been to implement initiatives of his predecessors. &quot;He has taken very few himself,&quot; he adds.    Mr. McMillan retorts that some people's expectations are unrealistic. &quot;There is no button that can be pressed to correct environmental problems,&quot; he says.    A political scientist, Mr. McMillan is one of the government's most effective performers in the House of Commons. When former Liberal Environment Minister Charles Caccia criticized the Mulroney government's own acid-rain record, Mr. McMillan replied that Mr. Caccia &quot;moralizing on acid rain is like Lady Chatterley moralizing on sex -- lots of experience but no credibility.&quot;    On weekends, Mr. McMillan likes to get home to Charlottetown, the capital of Prince Edward Island in eastern Canada, where his family lives in a large seaside frame house that was once a hotel.    There, he says, he sees first-hand the effects of acid rain while bicycling around Charlottetown, a small, bucolic city dotted with clapboard buildings and historic landmarks, with his three-year-old daughter perched in the back seat. Pedaling by historic sandstone churches, he sees walls corroded by acid rain. &quot;You can see where the stone has turned to powder,&quot; he says, rubbing imaginary sandstone through his fingers.    Still, despite occasionally strident comments about the U.S. responsibility for acid-rain damage, he insists he isn't anti-American. &quot;I explicitly reject the kind of America-bashing that becomes internationally fashionable from time to time,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
