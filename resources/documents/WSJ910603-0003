The Seattle company, which built the wide-body 767 thatwent down last week near Bangkok, killing all 223 people onboard, stressed that &quot;there are other facts that must beexamined . . . before any firm conclusions about the cause ofthe accident can be drawn.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But, after analyzing the airliner's cockpit voice recorderover the weekend, investigators seemed to be turning theirattention to the likelihood that a thrust reverser on oneengine somehow deployed in flight.   Yesterday, officials of the U.S. National TransportationSafety Board couldn't be reached for comment. But previouslythe agency has said that any information gained from therecorders would be turned over to Thai investigators, whowould be responsible for making any announcements.   Thrust reversers, which are built inhouse by Boeing forthe 767, are designed to help stop an aircraft once it haslanded. Airliners have mechanical safeguards to make suretheir thrust reversers don't engage until they're on theground, as well as equipment to deal with any unintentionaldeployment. Moreover, in order to receive federalcertification for the 767, Boeing had to demonstrate that theplane remained controllable even with a thrust reverserturned on in midair.   At a news conference in Vienna, Nikki Lauda, the owner ofLauda Air, told reporters that an advisory light -- thelowest of three levels of warning -- had become lit in thecockpit shortly before the crash, and that a voice was heardsaying the light was glowing intermittently.   Seconds later, the voice of the first officer was heardsaying, &quot;It deployed.&quot; Mr. Lauda, himself a pilot and formerauto racing champion, said he took that to mean that anengine had gone into reverse thrust. &quot;That means one thrustbackward, the other forward,&quot; Mr. Lauda said.   The 767 line went into service in 1982, and as of the endof March, there were 364 767s included in the fleets of 38operators. Among them are Air Canada, All Nippon Airways,American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, JapanAirlines, and United Airlines. The model flown by Lauda was a767-300 extended range aircraft powered by two PW-4060engines. Those are manufactured by United TechnologiesCorp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney division.   A Boeing spokesman said company engineers could recall oneother incident in which a 767 thrust-reverser deployed inflight, &quot;but the mechanisms to deal with those circumstancesworked properly and the plane landed safely.&quot; The spokesmancautioned that the earlier incident &quot;may have no relevancewhatsoever&quot; to the Lauda Air crash.   &quot;There are other aspects of this accident that merit veryclose examination,&quot; he said, while declining to elaborate.Originally, investigators centered on the possibility that abomb had been planted on the plane, but that theory has wanedin recent days. There was also a report that an engine mayhave imploded, but Pratt andamp; Whitney dismissed that as rankspeculation.   Boeing said it expected more details to emerge once theairliner's flight-data recorder -- which, like the voicerecorder, is now in the hands of National TransportationSafety Board officials in Washington -- was evaluated. ButMr. Lauda said he understood that the data recorder wasdamaged and couldn't be used to help assess the cause of thecrash.</TEXT></DOC>
