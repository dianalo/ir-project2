In accordance with section517(c) of the 1987 Act, the rule eliminates the former three pronged ``specialpriority'' test for the selection of homesteaders and substitutes a singlepriority selection criterion_that the prospective homesteader should bea ``lower-income'' person or family. The rule also implements section 517(d)of the 1987 Act, which authorizes States and units of general local governmentparticipating in the program to enter into agreements with designated ``qualifiednon-profit organizations'' to perform functions under the local urban homesteadingprogram, including selecting homesteaders and properties, and acceptingtitle to and conveying the properties to homesteaders. Finally, the rulealso makes a number of specific changes in program procedures, such asspecifying certain additional documents that must be submitted with a locality'surban homesteading application, setting a guideline that a local urbanhomesteading agency should generally anticipate homesteading a minimumof five properties per year in order to participate effectively in theprogram, and raising the existing limit on the values of properties selectedfor homesteading from $20,000 to $25,000 for one-unit properties, and form$5,000 to $8,000 per additional unit in two- to four-unit properties. Inaddition, the program's fund reservation system is being changed from anannual reservation based on estimated annual needs to a system of first-come,first-served reservations for specific properties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>July 17, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Marion F.

Section 517(c) eliminates the former three-pronged ``special priority''test for the selection of homesteaders and substitutes a single priorityselection criterion_that the homesteader selected should be a ``lower-income''person or family. Section 517(d) authorizes States and units of general local governmentto designate a ``qualified non-profit organization,'' or a public agency,to act as the local urban homesteading agency (LUHA)_including acceptingtitle to and conveying properties to homesteaders if they so choose.  In addition to the amendments made by sections 517 (c) and (d) of the 1987Act, section 517(a) amends the 1974 Act to extend the authority for thelocal property and the multifamily property urban homesteading demonstrations.These demonstrations would be implemented by Notice, rather than by permanentregulations, if they were reinstated. However, the Department is not currentlyplanning to implement either of these demonstrations in FY 1989. Also, section 517(b) amends section 106(d)(3)(A) of the 1974 Act to allowState participants in the Urban Homesteading Program to use Community DevelopmentBlock Grant (CDBG) funds for urban homesteading administrative expenses,consistent with the authority available to CDBG grantees other than States.This provision will be implemented by an appropriate revision to the StateCDBG Regulations, rather than in this rule. However, this provision isself-executing, and, therefore, it does not require regulatory action tobe effective. States participating in the Urban Homesteading Program maycharge eligible administrative expenses incurred after February 5, 1988(the effective date of the 1987 Act) in operating their urban homesteadingprograms to their otherwise available State CDBG administrative funds,provided such administrative expenditures would satisfy other Title I requirements.Other changes to Part 590 in this rule are being promulgated at HUD's initiative.Generally, these changes stem from the need to update certain provisionsin keeping with comments received from Congressional committee reports,comments from local officials, and HUD's own experience in administeringthe program since the last major revision of the regulations (see 50 FR25941, June 24, 1985). The principal amendments to Part 590 are discussed below in the order thatthey appear in the final rule. Other technical amendments are in the followingsections of Part 590: Sections 590.1 (a) and (b); 590.5 (definitions of``Act'' and ``LUHA'' are amended; new definitions of ``lower-income families''and ``qualified community organization are added; and definition of ``locallyowned property'' is deleted); andSection;andSection; 590.7; 590.11 (c) and(d); 590.13; 590.15; 590.17; 590.19; 590.23; 590.29; and 590.31. Thesetechnical amendments have not been separately discussed below, since theyare either editorial in nature, or they are conforming changes to makethe amended provision consistent with one of the principal amendments inthe proposed rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Amendments to Part 590 </ITAG>In andSection;590.7, ``Program requirements,'' the final rule adds guidancethat, in general, local agencies shall select neighborhoods so as to beable to anticipate homesteading a minimum of five properties per year,in order for their programs to be cost-effective and have discernible impact.Under andSection;590.13, ``Standards for HUD review and approval of a localurban homesteading program'', compliance with this and other requirementsof Part 590 will be considered by HUD in determining whether to approvean applicant's initial application or annual request for program participation.These provisions are established in view of the high demand for scarceprogram funds in order to establish a reasonable threshold level necessaryfor continued program participation. Regional economic conditions dictatenot only the availability of federally-owned properties but also theirprice range. These factors, in turn, influence the feasibility of homesteadingin the region. Over time, economic conditions shift within regions of thecountry, so that homesteading may become infeasible in a previously activearea due to a lack of foreclosed single-family properties in the HUD, VA,and FmHA inventories, or the increased cost of such properties. Conversely,as more properties become available or their values decrease, homesteadingmay become very active in an area previously inactive. Without a thresholdprogram level, communities could continue indefinitely in the program,operating ineffective, expensive, low level programs, while other areaswith greater need for program resources find it difficult or impossibleto obtain funding. Under ``Program requirements'' at andSection;590.7(b)(2), the homesteaderselection section is being modified to conform the regulations to section517(c) of the 1987 Act. The three existing priority selection criteriaare deleted and one priority criterion set forth, which gives priorityto eligible ``lower-income families or individuals,'' as defined by 24CFR Part 813. Since HUD has already advised local urban homesteading agenciesthat this provision is considered self-executing, local agencies shouldalready be selecting homesteaders in accordance with the new single criterionfor priority. However, homesteaders notified of their selection in accordancewith the previous special priority before February 5, 1988 (the effectivedate of the 1987 Act) remain entitled to properties, if they have not receivedthem yet. The final rule makes no change in the basic effect to the statutorypriority from existing rules, apart from the simplification of the criterionfor priority selection itself. Specifically, a local urban homesteadingagency (LUHA) still may not select a homesteader who is not entitled topriority if there is an available priority homesteading candidate who hasapplied and is qualified for the particular property involved. However,as discussed under ``Public Comments_Selection Criteria'' below, HUD nowexplicitly recognizes in the final rule that determining who is qualifiedfor a particular property requires reasonably matching the size of thehousehold selected as homesteaders to the bedroom size of the propertyavailable. Finally, a new provision, designated (iii), was added to andSection;590.7(b)(2)of the proposed rule and has not been changed in the final rule. This newrequirement provides that membership in, or ties to, particular privateorganizations shall not be made a factor affecting homesteader selection.With the advent of non-profit community organizations being designatedas LUHAs, HUD believes it is important to specify that membership in anyprivate organization, doing business with such an organization, or anyother ties to a particular private organization, are not made criteriafor homesteader selection. Also under ``Program requirements'' in andSection;590.7, amendments to subparagraphs(b)(4) and (b)(6) have been made in order to clarify the LUHA's responsibilityto assist in securing compliance with Section 312 Program loan terms andto find a replacement homesteader where it appears that the initial applicanthas defaulted on a section 312 loan during the homesteader's conditionaltitle period: During this period, foreclosure of the section 312 loan isgenerally not a viable option, since it either results in undue loss toHUD, if HUD forecloses only on the homesteader's interest in the property,or it results in the property being lost to the homesteading program, ifthe LUHA gives up its reverter interest in the property and allows HUDto foreclose and then to sell the property on the open market. The bestoption both to minimize HUD's loss and to preserve the property for homesteadingis for the local agency to identify a successor homesteader who will assumethe section 312 loan, or as much of the loan as the property's value atthe time of assumption will support. The amendments are designed to givelocal agencies clearer regulatory notice of this policy, which is morefully described in CPD Notice 88-21 on this subject issued under HUD'sUnified Issuances System. Also, the amendments to andSection;590.7(b)(6)allow HUD to shorten the homesteading period required of the successorhomesteader under that section, if that is necessary to attract a successorhomesteader. Under ``Program requirements'' in andSection;590.7, a new paragraph (c) isadded entitled ``Designation of LUHA.'' As at present, the applicant Stateor unit of general local government may act as its own local urban homesteadingagency (LUHA), conducting the program and accepting and conveying titleto federally owned properties in its own name, or it may designate a legallyseparate and independent public agency to do so. Similar to present practice,the designation is approved by HUD as part of the program application approvalprocess, and it remains in effect until a new LUHA is designated by theapplicant by a program amendment approved by HUD, or the local urban homesteadingprogram is closed out. Finally, also as already permitted (although notspecified in the regulation in effect prior to this rule), the final rulespecifies that the LUHA itself may carry out its program functions throughone or more third party contractors, consultants, or agents, except forthe acceptance and conveyance of title to properties. The final rule makesclear that the third party agreements must be in writing, and it may notrelieve the LUHA or the applicant of responsibility for the conduct ofthe program.   In addition, based on section 517(d) of the 1987 Act, HUD also is allowingqualified community organizations to act as LUHAs, under andSection; 590.7(c)(2)(iii)of the final rule. As provided by the 1987 Act, the final rule defines``qualified community organizations'' as non-profit corporations whosedirectors serve without pay and which qualify as IRS section 501(c)(3)tax exempt organizations (See andSection; 590.7(c)(4)). Consistent with presentpractice, any designated LUHA (whether public or private) must have legalauthority to accept and convey title to properties for homesteading purposes.The final rule specifically provides in andSection; 590.7(c)(1) that thiskey function may not be passed on to another entity by the LUHA unlessHUD approves a program amendment designating a new LUHA, because up tothree Federal agencies must know on a day-to-day basis what local entitythey are authorized to deal with in conveying properties, and to assurethat the LUHA remains properly accountable for the properties it obtains,both to HUD and to the homesteaders who deal with the LUHA.Finally, the final rule requires a written agreement between the LUHA andthe applicant, and it specifies at andSection; 590.7(c)(3) certain provisionswhich the agreement must contain at a minimum. HUD believes that a writtenagreement detailing the responsibility of the LUHA is essential for non-profitsto act as LUHAs. HUD also believes that program responsibilities will beclarified and accountability strengthened if designated public agenciesare also required to enter into such agreements with the responsible Statesand units of general local government, and the final rule so provides atandSection; 590.7(c)(2)(ii).Under ``applications'' at andSection; 590.11, the final rule requires localurban homesteading agencies applying for the first time to submit additionalinformation in their application package. HUD is now requesting a descriptionof the applicant's proposed homesteader selection procedures which complieswith the 1987 Act and andSection; 590.7(b)(2) of the regulations, copiesof the applicant's proposed legal documents complying with andSection;andSection;590.7(b) (3), (5) and (7), an estimate of the number of properties to beacquired during the program year, and a copy of the applicant's writtenagreement designating any local urban homesteading agency in compliancewith andSection; 590.7(c). Receipt of these specific documents is necessaryto avoid serious flaws in program design which HUD has found more difficultto correct after the fact. The Department still wishes to offer maximumlatitude to local agencies administering the program, but several recentapplicants have commented that they prefer more specificity on these mattersat program startup. Similarly, in andSection; 590.11(b), HUD is requiringpreviously approved applicants to submit the information newly requiredby andSection;andSection; 590.11(a) (4), (5), (7), (8), and (9) for the firstprogram year following the effective date of the final rule.Under ``Standards for HUD review and approval of a local urban homesteadingprogram'' at andSection; 590.13, HUD is adding language changing the pointat which environmental review occurs. That will now occur when an urbanhomesteading neighborhood is approved under this section.Under ``Transfer of HUD-owned property'' at andSection; 590.17(b)(4) andunder ``Reimbursement to FmHA and VA'' at andSection; 590.18(c)(1), the administrativelyimposed maximum amount that may be charged to section 810 appropriationsfor acquisition of federally-owned, single-dwelling unit properties isbeing raised from $20,000 to $25,000, in keeping with suggestions fromthe House-Senate Conference Committee on H.J. Res. 395 (FY 1988 AppropriationsAct) in House of Representatives Report No. 100-498 at page 843. This willhelp keep pace with inflation in real estate market values being experiencedin some areas of the country. This cost cap has not been adjusted since1985. HUD is, however, amending andSection;andSection; 590.17 and 590.18 todelete HUD Field Office authority to grant local program-wide exceptionsto this acquisition cost cap, because of the need to further target thelimited program funds to sections of the nation experiencing softer realestate markets. Under the final rule, the price paid for a property shallbe the as-is fair market value, not to exceed $25,000, or a negotiatedlesser amount, unless an exception for an individual property is grantedby a HUD Field Office. An additional amount up to $8,000 per unit may alsobe charged to section 810 funds for properties with two to four dwellingunits. This is an increase from $5,000 per additional dwelling unit, afigure which had not been adjusted since the inception of the program.In addition, the 30 day time frame for which HUD/FHA has been obligatedto suspend its routine property disposition activity in urban homesteadingneighborhoods is shortened to 21 days to reflect actual program experienceand realize economies for the Department.In andSection; 590.17(b)(2), andSection; 590.18(b), andSection; 590.17(c) andandSection; 590.18(d) changes of a similar nature are made for the purposeof clarifying when the reservation of funds to reimburse HUD, VA, or FmHAfor the transfer of a specific property, and how long the reservation mayremain outstanding. These changes are necessitated by the change from anannual to a property specific reservation system, which is discussed belowunder ``Public Comments_Reservation of Funds''.At andSection; 590.23, ``Program close-out,'' the final rule gives HUD specificauthority to terminate a local urban homesteading program if the LUHA hasnot acquired any properties for the last two fiscal years and local marketconditions demonstrate that an insufficient number of properties will beavailable for the next fiscal year. Section 590.23(c) is also revised tomake clear the LUHA's obligation to continue to monitor, enforce, and implementexisting agreements with homesteaders after close-out.Finally, at andSection; 590.31(e), the final rule clarifies the remedialstandard under which HUD may direct the LUHA to repay HUD for homesteadproperties that the LUHA has mishandled. The former standard on its facedealt only with properties that the LUHA had ``converted to its own use.''This standard clearly covered properties that the LUHA had sold, rented,or used for its own purposes without HUD approval; it did not as clearlycover situations in which the LUHA's negligent failure to preserve andprotect the property permitted deterioration that made it infeasible tohomestead the property, or where the LUHA simply did nothing with the propertyfor more than a year, unless excused by HUD under andSection; 590.7(b)(3)of the final rule. The revised language of the final rule corrects theseoversights.A proposed rule was published for comment on October 19, 1988, at 53 FR41026. The public comments received and the disposition of those commentsare discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments </ITAG>HUD received seven public comments: four from cities, one from a county,one from a technical consulting firm, and one from a HUD Field Office.The principal issues raised are summarized below, with HUD's response followingeach issue.Five Property Threshold_andSection;590.7(a)One commenter misinterpreted the five property guideline for annual programparticipation levels by thinking that this threshold would be applicableto each approved homesteading neighborhood. In fact, the five propertythreshold is meant to apply on a program-wide basis, for each LUHA, andnot on a neighborhood basis, in order for their efforts to be more costeffective and have discernible impact in the community.Selection Criteria_andSection;590.7(b)(2)One commenter objected to the provision in paragraph (v) of andSection;590.7(b)(2)of the proposed rule that appeared to require that a single head of householdcould not occupy a property having more than two (2) bedrooms because thenumber of family members could increase during the five (5) year occupancyrequirement.As of andSection;590.7(b)(2)(v) in the proposed rule (concerning ``otherreasonable selection criteria''), the final rule divides this provisioninto two parts and renumbers the paragraphs of andSection;590.7(b)(2). Newparagraph (iv) now contains the provisions formerly in paragraph (v) withrespect to locally-adopted criteria designed to reasonably match homesteaderhousehold size to the bedroom size of the property for which the homesteaderis being selected. Former paragraph (iv) (concerning selection priorityfor lower income families) has been redesignated as paragraph (v), andthe rest of former paragraph (v) (other reasonable selection criteria)has been redesignated as paragraph (vi).With respect to the public comment cited above, the revised language ofparagraph (iv) now states that a one-person household may not ``receive''(as opposed to ``occupy'') a homestead property with more than two bedrooms,unless there are no longer households on the waiting list. Since the provisionin question is a selection requirement, the word ``occupy'' was inappropriatein context. Generally, once a homesteader receives a property, there isno further Federal requirement that the homesteader continue to meet regulatorycriteria that relate only to selection, such as the household/propertysize matching provision, or the provision that a homesteader may not ownany other residential property (see paragraph (i) of andSection;590.7(b)(2)).Of course, after a homesteader does receive (take title to) a property,he or she must continue to comply with the ongoing requirements of thehomesteader agreement under andSection;590.7(b)(5), such as continuing tooccupy the property as his/her personal residence for at least five years.New paragraph (iv) of andSection;590.7(b)(2) contains another apparent changefrom the proposed rule, which concerns the relationship of household/propertysize matching criteria to the lower income selection priority in paragraph(v), as redesignated in the final rule. HUD views the household/propertysize matching criteria as necessary, eligibility-based selection requirements,which override the ``priority'' in paragraph (v), and the language following``notwithstanding'' at the end of paragraph (vi) in the final rule is intendedto make that clear. On the other hand, the ``other reasonable selectioncriteria'' concering locally-adopted residency preferences, which are referredto in paragraph (vi) of andSection;590.8(b)(2) of the final rule, are notintended to override the lower income priority. That is, a lower-incomeprospective homesteader on the waiting list should receive a property beforeanyone on the waiting list who is <T3>not</T3> entitled to the lower-income priority, even if the lower-incomehousehold is not entitled to local residency preference and the non-lower-incomehousehold does not have local residency preference. Such locally-adoptedresidency preferences may operate <T3>only</T3> among classes of prospective homesteaders having the samepriority status.Timely Conveyance to Homesteaders_andSection;590.7(b)(3)One commenter urged that the rule discuss the timely conveyance of propertiesto homesteaders because it is in a LUHAs' best interests to convey propertiesto homesteaders shortly after acquisition. Therefore, at andSection;590.7(b)(3),language has been added to state that the time frame between transfer ofa homesteading property from HUD to the LUHA and the LUHA's conditionalconveyance to a homesteader shall be within one year, or less, of titletransfer to the LUHA unless otherwise approved by HUD in writing priorto the expiration of the one-year period.Acquisition Cost Cap_andSection;590.17(b)(4)(i)Two cities commented on the increase of the acquisition cost cap per propertyto $25,000 and requested that it be higher. Both of their LUHAs have beenusing program-wide high cost exceptions in the recent past which enabledthem to purchase properties closer to $35,000, and they wish to continuethis practice. In making this change, the Department realize that not everycommunity may be able to continue participation in the Urban HomesteadingProgram indefinitely. However, the limited program resources availablecompared to the national demand for section 810 funding mitigates againsta further increase in the acquisition cost cap at this time or a continuationof the use of program-wide high cost approvals. As a basis of comparison,the average acquisition cost per property in FY 1988 was only $18,043,so the majority of LUHAs are able to obtain suitable properties under $25,000.For LUHAs who wish to continue in the program, and who can not find propertiesin this range, they are always free to add CDBG, or other local funds,to the $25,000 in Section 810 funds to cover higher cost acquisitions (althoughthese additional funds cannot be repaid by the homesteader).Transfer of HUD-Owned Property (Exceptions)_andSection;590.17(c)One city expressed concern about the possibility of losing potential homesteadingproperties to ``emergency housing needs.'' This issue became more importantto LUHAs after the issuance of a temporary restraining order in the caseof <T3>Deborah Lee v. Kemp, </T3>Civil Action No. 88-2395-OG (D.D.C.), whichfor a short time prohibited FHA from selling properties until the courtheard oral arguments to determine whether a preliminary injunction shouldissue. While that restraining order has been lifted, the case is stillin litigation and, of course, HUD would have to comply with any court orderedaction. While the Department understands the commenter's concern, it wouldbe neither prudent nor effective for the Department to attempt to restrictthe disposition of FHA-owned properties in such a manner that emergencyhousing needs are not considered. However, it appears likely that therewill be an ample supply of properties appropriate for homesteading in mostregions of the country even if some of the FHA inventory is used to helpalleviate the homeless situation.Also, in response to two commenters' concerns as to how much time a LUHAhas after acceptance to close on the property, clarifying language hasbeen added to andSection;590.17(c)(1), where it had not been clear that aLUHA has 30 days from its <T3>acceptance</T3> of HUD's offer of a property to accept title and closeon the tranaction.Reservation of Funds_andSection;590.21The proposed rule formalized major changes in how program budget authorityis made available for the use of participating LUHAs. The former systemprovided that each LUHA would be given an ``annual reservation.'' Overthe course of the fiscal year, the LUHAs could then identify propertiesand acquire them with reimbursement in the appropriate amount per propertyto the applicable Federal housing loan fund, up to the amount of its ``annualreservation.'' The proposed rule would have changed the funding mechanismto a ``first-come, first-served'' reservation system for individual properties,``subject to available fund limitations.'' In response to public commentsand discussions with local officials, the final rule retains, but modifiesand clarifies, the ``first-come, first-served'' system contemplated bythe proposed rule.With respect to the basic decision to change to the first-come, first-servedsystem, HUD continues to believe it is generally more efficient and equitablethan the former system. In particular, the former system tended to ``lock-in''relative funding levels among LUHAs early in the fiscal year, and theselevels were based on even earlier data on past fund use and property availability.In reality, however, the supply of properties available to each LUHA duringthe fiscal year from the HUD, FmHA, and VA inventories may fluctuate significantly,leading to imbalances between the funding authority available to particularLUHAs and the relative numbers of properties available to them. Previously,complicated adjustments were required to revise relative funding levelsat the end of each fiscal year. Furthermore, the older system tended tofavor LUHAs that had been in the program longer, since they had more opportunityto build up a high program level in the past, even though some may nowhave relatively smaller numbers of properties available for homesteading.The modified first-come, first-served system in the final rule continuesto make funding generally more competitive among LUHAs, while making changesto improve the fairness of the system, compared to the proposed rule.One commenter opposed the first-come, first-served system, urging a morestringent priority for large inventory cities, and stating that a strictfirst-come, first-served policy favored LUHAs closer to the applicablefield office. Another commenter agreed with the new system in general,but suggested that the strict first-come, first-served policy favored largerLUHAs, and that smaller LUHAs needed at least a brief initial set-asidein order to effectively identify and request fund reservations for specificproperties.HUD has considered these comments, and the final rule permits HUD fieldoffices to establish, for not more than 60 days, minimum initial allocationsof section 810 funding authority for each participating LUHA in their jurisdication,against which each LUHA will be exclusively authorized to request reservationsfor specific properties under either andSection;590.17 (HUD-owned property)or andSection;590.19 (VA and FmHA owned-property) for that period. Afterthese temporary allocations are used up or have expired, the LUHA willcompete on an equal basis with other LUHAs in the field office jurisdictionfor reservations from the field office subassignment. This procedure providesan initial opportunity for smaller LUHAs, or those farther from the fieldoffice, to obtain properties on a less competitive basis. Thereafter, however,LUHAs which are more efficient in seeking properties, and which have moreproperties available from which to choose, will find it easier to obtainfunding.Furthermore, HUD's fund assignments to HUD Regional and Field Offices,from which LUHAs request reservations, are in part based upon past fundinglevels and in part upon projected demand. Therefore, LUHA's which havelarger inventories, and which are also efficient in requesting and homesteadingproperties, will gradually help increase assignments made to their fieldoffices and will, thereby, be able to obtain a greater share of programresources.<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous</ITAG>A HUD Field Office commenter asked for clarification of eligible expensesfor FmHA and VA properties. This will be handled in the handbook for thisprogram.The same commenter recommended that the definition of ``eligible applicant''be expanded to include legally formed regional planning agencies and developmentdistricts. With proper coordination, a regional planning or developmentagency, if it has the authority to accept and convey properties to homesteadersin its own name and otherwise to carry out a local homesteading programunder Part 590, could prepare and submit concurrent applications on behalfof several units of general local government, as their joint ``designatedagency-LUHA''. However, the units of general local government would haveto sign the applications themselves as a formal matter. Also, such an agencycould be designated to act as a LUHA for the State in which it is located.Given these options, as well as the general Federal policy embodied inthe Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968, which favors applicationsfor Federal assistance from states and cities or counties, rather thanspecial purpose bodies, HUD is not disposed to change Part 590 to allowregional agencies directly to apply on their own behalf for homesteadingprogram participation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Findings and Certifications</ITAG>The collection of information requirements contained in this rule havebeen submitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980.

TheFinding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection duringregular business hours (7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. weekdays) in the Officeof the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Departmentof Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington,DC 20410.This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291. Analysis indicates that it doesnot: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), theundersigned hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule implementsseveral statutory provisions that improve the Urban Homesteading Program.These changes have neither a significant economic impact on, nor an effecton, a substantial number of small entities.<T3>Executive Order 12612, Federalism. </T3>The General Counsel, as theDesignated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, <T3>Federalism</T3>, has determined that this rule does not have ``federalismimplications'' because it does not have substantial direct effects on theStates (including their political subdivisions), or on the distributionof power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Thisrule primarily relaxes and simplifies the criteria for selecting homesteaders.The provision under this rule that authorizes States and units of generallocal government to designate qualified non-profit organizations or publicagencies to act as urban homesteading agencies is merely a function ofdelegation and does not affect the powers and responsibilities of the Statesor units of general local government.<T3>Executive Order 12606, the Family. </T3>The General Counsel, as theDesignated Official under Executive Order 12606, <T3>the Family,</T3> has determined that this rule does not have potentialsignificant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-beingbecause it does not affect the mechanics and benefits of the Urban HomesteadingProgram so far as the beneficiaries of the program are concerned. The ruleprimarily simplifies some of the requirements and makes procedural changeswhich do not affect the intended beneficiaries.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number is 14.230.This rule was listed as item number 995 in the Department's SemiannualAgenda of Regulations published on April 24, 1989 (54 FR 16708) under ExecutiveOrder 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 590</ITAG>Urban homesteading, Administrative practice and procedure, Grant programs:Housing and community development, Low and moderate income housing.Accordingly, the Department revises 24 CFR Part 590 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 590_URBAN HOMESTEADING</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.1 Scope and purpose of regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.3 Waiver authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.5 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.7 Program requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.9 Listing of HUD-owned, VA-owned, and FmHA-owned properties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.11 Applications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.13 Standards for HUD review and approval of a local urban homesteadingprogram.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.15 Urban homesteading program participation agreement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.17 Transfer of HUD-owned property.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.18 Reimbursement to FmHA and VA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.19 Use of section 810 funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.21 Reservation of funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.23 Program close-out.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.25 Retention of records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.27 Audit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.29 HUD review of LUHA performance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">590.31 Corrective and remedial actions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Sec. 810, Housing and Community Development Act of1974 (12 U.S.C. 1706e); sec. 7(d), Department of Housing and Urban DevelopmentAct (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 590.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Scope and purpose of regulation.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Scope. </T3>This part applies to the Urban Homesteading Program authorizedunder section 810(b) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974.The program is generally administered through the Department's field offices,which can provide information to the public about the States and localitiesparticipating, as well as technical assistance to participants about applyingfor and operating the program.(b) <T3>Purpose. </T3>The purpose of the Urban Homesteading Program is to useexisting housing stock to provide homeownership opportunities, primarilyfor lower income families, thereby encouraging public and private investmentin selected neighborhoods and assisting in their preservation and revitalization.The program provides for the transfer without payment to a local urbanhomesteading agency (LUHA) of federally owned properties for use in a HUD-approvedlocal urban homesteading program.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 590.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Waiver authority.</ITAG>HUD may waive any requirement of this part not required by law wheneverit determines that undue hardship would result from applying the requirement,or where applying the requirement would adversely affect achievement ofthe purposes of the program.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 590.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>``Act'' means section 810 of the Housing and Community Development Actof 1974, as amended from time to time.``Applicant'' means any State or unit of general local government thatapplies for HUD approval of a local urban homesteading program under theseregulations.``Federally-owned property'' means any real property to which the Secretaryof HUD, the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of Veterans Affairsholds title and which is:(1) Improved with a one- to four-family residence;(2) Unrepaired and not the subject of an outstanding repair or sales contract;and(3) Not occupied by an individual or family under a lease.
