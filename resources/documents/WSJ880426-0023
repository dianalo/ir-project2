The suit, filed in U.S. District Court here, marks the first admission by the United unit of the Air Line Pilots Association that its year-long effort for employee ownership of the carrier would be crippled by the so-called &quot;protective covenants&quot; in the machinists' contract negotiated last fall.    The pilots' union said one covenant provides that the pilots and flight attendants at the carrier can participate in an employee ownership plan at United only on terms and procedures set by the airline and the machinists. Another covenant states that in a takeover, the machinists can either renegotiate their contract or extend their wage increases for another three years.    The suit says the covenants amount to a &quot;poison pill designed to prevent a change in control&quot; of Allegis.    A United spokesman said the company couldn't comment because it hadn't seen the suit.    A spokesman for the International Association of Machinists said the provisions were negotiated &quot;basically to protect our members. On the legality, I guess the courts will have to decide that.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
