A constitutional court last week declared unconstitutional aparliamentary ruling that allowed Moslem women to cover their headswhile attending university classes with men.   Moslem fundamentalists staged protest marches and the governmentof Premier Turgut Ozal found itself in an increasingly uncomfortablesituation during campaigning for March 26 local elections.   Advocates of secularism see the headcover as a political symbolof those who want Turkey to return to Islamic laws, as Iran has.   Tolerance for the fundamentalists angered some secular groups,including Turkey's elite and military leaders.   On Sunday, Gen. Necip Torumtay,, chief of staff of the armedforces, paid a surprise visit to President Kenan Evren. Torumtaylater told the Istanbul daily Cumhuriyet, ``We are following theissue closely.''   This led Erdal Inonu, leader of the major opposition SocialDemocratic Populist Party, to declare: ``We are against a solutionthrough (military) intervention. We believe we can overcome thesedangers within the democratic system.''   Turkey's armed forces staged coups in 1960, 1971 and 1980.   On Tuesday, Torumtay said in a written statement to news media:   ``The Turkish armed forces ... knows its place and duties withinthe constitutional order and is a true believer in and loyal toparliamentary democracy with all its members.''   He said he issued the statement because his earlier statementsunderwent ``different interpretations in newspapers.''   Yusuf Ozal, the premier's brother and a Cabinet minister,criticized the court decision as ``badly timed. ... It was wrong totake such a decision before elections.''   Turgut Ozal's governing, conservative Motherland Party iscompeting with several center-right parties for the votes of Moslemfundamentalists, who comprise about 10 percent of the totalelectorate of 27 million.   Ozal's own party is split on the headgear issue, and interferenceby Iran complicated matters.   On Monday, Iranian women students marched through Tehran toprotest the ban on Islamic dress in Turkey's campuses.   Turkish papers reported that Tehran radio, in Turkish-languagebroadcasts beamed to eastern Turkey, urged fundamentalists to rebelagainst the secular order.   Newspaper reports said authorities detained Iranian agents whowere among the protesters in Turkey, but officials did not confirmthese reports.   Beginning in the 1920s, Turkey adopted Western laws with thereforms of Kemal Ataturk, founder of the republic.</TEXT></DOC>
