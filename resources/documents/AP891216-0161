Some of the concern surfaces in generalities _ for instance,about the possibility that the long boom in residential real estatedating back into the 1960s might have peaked.   But it has also manifested itself in stock-market specifics.Shares of many regional banks with big commitments to real estateloans, and of the large national home mortgage companies, have beenfalling sharply or at least lagging conspicuously of late.   ``It seems that regional banks are in the headlines asfrequently as the big money center institutions recently,'' saysthe Value Line Investment Survey in a just-published report on thebanking outlook.   ``The reason is that problems with real estate loans aresurfacing, particularly in the Northeast, Southeast and Southwest.   ``Cities as distant and different as Boston and Phoenix fellvictim to euphoria with regard to population and business growth inthe `80s,'' says Value Line analyst Theresa Brophy.   ``On the real estate front, we're not sure that the worst isover. Slower economic growth in the year ahead might cause othermarkets to weaken.''   Of course, the ``national'' real estate market is really made upof many diverse local markets where conditions vary dramatically.   In the Southwestern ``oil patch,'' real estate suffered awell-publicized bust in the 1980s even as prices of properties insome other parts of the country kept climbing.   Through the industrial and agricultural Midwest as well,property values suffered from adverse economic conditions.   In some of those areas, speculation now focuses on the chancesfor a rebound from depressed levels.   But an overall slowdown of late in the rise of real estateprices has nevertheless stirred worries among analysts who havebeen wondering what debt problems might arise in any kind ofnational business slump.   Those concerns intensified on Friday when the Bank of NewEngland in Boston announced increases in its loan-loss reserve andnon-performing assets, and said it would report a substantial lossfor the year.   An accompanying drop in stock prices overall Friday left the DowJones average of 30 industrials at 2,739.55, up 8.11 from the weekbefore.   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchangecomposite index up .53 at 193.45; the NASDAQ composite index forthe over-the-counter market down 12.38 at 443.84, and the AmericanStock Exchange market value index up .55 at 193.47.   Volume on the Big Board averaged 185.54 million shares a day,against 151.55 million the week before.   Many optimists on the economic outlook pin their hopes ondeclining interest rates to support the real estate market, bylowering mortgage rates for buyers and allowing at least someexisting homeowners to refinance at lower costs.   The Federal Reserve is not confronted with a sharply decliningeconomy, said Richard Rippe at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., ``butthere are no grounds for complacency either.   ``The weakening signs are very clear and they do imply a risk ofrecession,'' Rippe maintained.   ``With wage and industrial price pressures moderate, inflationshould not be a major obstacle. Consequently, we expect furthermoves toward ease over the next few months. The Federal Reservewill want some additional insurance against the cumulation ofdownward pressures.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv weekend editions Dec. 16-17.</NOTE></DOC>
