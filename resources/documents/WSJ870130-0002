If successful, the restructuring would transform the steel company into a Southern California real estate developer and waste-treatment concern.    Kaiser, faced with huge liabilities to its retirees and other creditors, said yesterday that it is seeking buyers for its coal and power units. Although the sales wouldn't begin to meet all of Kaiser's about $623 million in liabilities, cash from the sales would give the company breathing room in negotiations with its lenders, said Bruce Hendry, Kaiser's chairman and chief executive officer.    In addition, Mr. Hendry said, the Colorado Springs, Colo.-based Kaiser would consider selling its two Northern California steel-fabricating plants if a buyer could be found.    The sales may face opposition from the company's former chairman, Monty H. Rial. Mr. Rial, who was replaced as chairman after Kaiser's preferred shareholders won a majority of its board, recently criticized plans for selling the coal unit. He argued that in the current depressed coal market, the unit would bring only a fraction of its potential value.    But Mr. Hendry said the sale of its Kaiser Coal Corp. unit was needed to raise &quot;cash, lots of cash,&quot; and would enable the company to better negotiate with its lenders and retirees, who have claims for about $240 million in unfunded pension liabilities. The power unit, Kaiser Power Corp., is a subsidiary of Kaiser Coal.    Mr. Hendry once again left open the possibility of Kaiser's filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. &quot;We're going to have to negotiate,&quot; he said. &quot;It may be in a Chapter 11 or it may not be in a Chapter 11.&quot; Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it devises a plan to pay off its debt.    Although Kaiser hasn't established an asking price, Kaiser Coal isn't likely to bring the $300 million liquidation value estimated in the late 1970's when energy prices were on the rise.    The Fontana, Calif., property includes two square miles in a high-growth area along Southern California's San Bernadino Freeway. Messrs. Hendry and Rial envision developing an industrial park on the site around an expanded hazardous-waste treatment plant.    Mr. Rial and a group of investors bought Kaiser in 1983, largely for the company's sizable coal assets. Mr. Rial later ran afoul of the preferred shareholders after the company failed to pay two preferred dividends and make payments toward retiring preferred stock issued during the buyout of Kaiser. The shareholders, led by Mr. Hendry, gained control of the Kaiser board earlier this month. </TEXT></DOC>
