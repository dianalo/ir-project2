That would force the opposition to try to oust her in ano-confidence vote when the new Parliament convenes Oct. 2.   With 99.7 percent of the ballots counted, official results showedboth Labor and its main rival, the Conservative Party, losingsupport they won in the 1985 elections.   The results showed Labor with 885,291 votes received 34.4percent, a loss of 6.4 percent from four years ago. TheConservatives had 565,901 votes and 22.1 percent for an 8.3 percentloss.   Major gainers were the rightist Progress Party with 331,944 votesfor 13 percent, which was 9.2 percent more than in the lastelection, and the Socialist Left with 257,579 votes _ 10.1 percentof the ballots and a 4.6 percent improvement.   Smaller parties showed modest gains or losses.   Labor was hurt by record unemployment and widespread discontentwith public services, but remains the largest party in this countryof 4.2 million people. Norway has been under welfare state policiesfor 40 years.   Clear weather encouraged a good turnout of the 3.2 millioneligible voters.   Non-socialist parties, which retained a combined majority, saidthey would try to smooth over differences to form a coalition.Bargaining could take weeks.   Mrs. Brundtland has governed with a parliamentary minority forthe last three years and said the situation was unchanged, implyingshe could continue in office.   Many disenchanted voters switched loyalties to the SocialistLeft, which supports Labor, leaving the socialist bloc with minorlosses.   The Socialist Left campaigned on a strong environmental platform,but it also opposes Norway's membership in the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization.   Final seat results may not be known until Wednesday because of anew election system that adds eight posts to the old 157-memberStorting, or parliament.   Norway's free-spending days came to an abrupt end with the ilprice crash of 1986, when its North Sea wealth evaporated.   Mrs. Brundtland said she was concerned over Labor's losses butthat it still ``looks like we'll have a parliament that isn't bad asa whole.''   Labor was projected to win 64 seats of the 165 seats. Itssocialist ally would add 16. The three-party non-socialist alliance_ Conservatives, Christian Democrats and Center Party _ would get 61seats. The unpredictable, right-wing Party of Progress would have20, with small parties and independents getting a total of fourseats.   ``The tendency is clearly toward a non-socialist majority. Thatmeans there will be negotiations for an alternative government,''said Wenche Frogn Sellaeg, deputy chairman of the Conservatives,Norway's second largest party.   The key lies with Carl I. Hagen, leader of the Party of Progress,an anti-tax party.   Hagen, who held the balance between blocs in the previouslegislature, toppled the last non-socialist government in 1986 overa proposed tax increase, allowing Mrs. Brundtland to take over witha minority Cabinet.   The opposition would need to overcome deep divisions on such keypolicies as taxation and farm subsidies to form a coalition.   ``We have always stretched out our hand to be part of acoalition,'' Hagen said, but the three other parties ``have rejectedus.''   The Progress Party has been excluded from alliances because itchallenges the basic principles of Norway's social democracy.   The Conservatives, led by Jan P. Syse, would remain second toLabor.   Asked by a reporter if he was going to be next prime minister,Syse drew a laugh from supporters by replying, ``We always worktoward the highest possible goals.''   Labor has governed Norway for 34 of the past 44 years andfashioned a welfare society. Taxes on income range up to 62.7percent. The government runs powerful companies like Statoil, whichexploits North Sea oil fields.   Labor's previous worst outcome in a postwar election was in 1973when it won 35.3 percent. Until 1961 it was a majority party.   Mrs. Brundtland, 50, is a U.S.-trained doctor who specialized inpublic health.   Economists credit her for fiscal policies and wage restraintsthat halved inflation in two years to 4.8 percent and turned abalance of payments deficit into a surplus. But unemployment nearlytripled in the same period to 5 percent, and companies went bankruptat the fastest rate since World War II. Surveys show Oslo to beEurope's most expensive capital.   Hagen, 45, a former marketing executive, complained that publicservices were in a shoddy state. He proposed allowing privateservices to compete with government-run institutions; privatizingpublic companies and limiting immigration, which he says Norwaycannot afford.   Despite her international reputation as a conservationist, Mrs.Brundtland also was attacked for alleged laxness toward pollution ofNorway's fjords.</TEXT></DOC>
