Modern fluorescent bulbs cost 20 times more than theirincandescent equivalents, but save money in the long runbecause they use only 25% as much energy and last 10 times aslong. But homeowners tend to shy away from fluorescents,remembering the long, ugly tubes and cold, flickering, noisylights of schoolroom, factory or office.   Now, thanks to work with color elements, fluorescents canproduce warm light rather than cold. &quot;Your wife would bepleased to see her face under it,&quot; says Gregg DeSilvio, amarket manager at the U.S. lighting subsidiary of Philips.   And by using electronic instead of magnetic parts,manufacturers have eliminated noise and flicker and shrunkfluorescents to where many can fit into a standard socket andunder the shade of a standard table lamp. The SylvaniaLighting division of GTE has just introduced an 18-wattfluorescent bulb that produces as much light as a 75-wattincandescent bulb, and is 6 3/4 inches long and two inches indiameter.   More work needs to be done. Terry McGowan, an engineer atGeneral Electric's lighting division, acknowledges that somebulb makers are still &quot;trying to hide&quot; even small fluorescenttubes with glass or plastic covers, which can make them toofat to fit inside most lampshade holders. Osram, a subsidiaryof Siemens, has begun offering German consumers a bulb inwhich the fluorescent tube has been folded three times tomake it shorter.   And Alsy Lighting of Pittsburgh has redesigned the wholelamp. A unit of Britain's Emess, Alsy has just produced aline of portable fluorescent lamps that hide the bulky partsof their GE bulbs in a traditional lamp base.                                                                                                          Everything Will Be Green,   Except the Decor                                                                                                          THE NATIONAL Audubon Society has begun work on what itclaims will be the most environmentally sound office buildingin the world: the society's new headquarters in lowerManhattan, designed to cut energy use by 50%.   Instead of undertaking new construction, Audubon isrenovating the 100-year-old Schermerhorn Building at 700Broadway. Designed by George B. Post, the architect of theNew York Stock Exchange, the building has a facade of roughsandstone, glazed brick, terra cotta and cast iron.   To save energy, Audubon will use extra insulation andwindow glass that lets in daylight but blocks summer heatwhile retaining winter heat. Lights by windows willautomatically dim or shut off as daylight increases.   Audubon plans to use drywall, ceramic tiles and countertops made of recycled materials. Occupants of the eight-storybuilding will be able to throw four kinds of materials downdifferent chutes to a basement recycling center. Food andother organic waste, for example, will be composted and usedin a rooftop garden. To make the headquarters safer foremployees, Audubon will use carpets and insulation free offormaldehyde and chlorofluorocarbons.   Environmental soundness costs money. But architectRandolph Croxton says the energy systems will pay forthemselves in three to five years. And at $110 per squarefoot, the price tag is &quot;not outside market costs&quot; in New YorkCity, he says.                                                                                                          Beyond the Pump:   A New Crest Dispenser                                                                                                          HELP IS on the way for those who consider messy toothpastea problem.   Crest now comes in a dispenser that sucks unusedtoothpaste back into the bottle when the user stopssqueezing. Procter andamp; Gamble, maker of the best-selling U.S.brand, adds that its Neat Squeeze package is easier to usethan a toothpaste tube and creates less package waste than apump.   Like a pump, Neat Squeeze stands on end and comes with outa box. But like a tube, it's squeezable. Squeezing this&quot;bag-in-a-bottle&quot; forces toothpaste out through a valve inthe neck; letting go allows excess paste to be sucked backin. Meanwhile, air enters through a valve at the bottom andfills the void created by the collapse of the inner bag. Theouter package retains its shape, so it can be squeezed fromanywhere: top, middle or bottom.   Though Neat Squeeze has only 70% as much packaging as apump, Pandamp;G says its design is more complex, so it costs asmuch. Company engineer Joan Szkutak says that, &quot;depending onhow hard the consumer works,&quot; the new dispenser leaves aboutthe same amount of paste in the container as a tube does.   Competitors are tight-lipped. Bob Murray, director ofcorporate communications for Colgate-Palmolive, won't discussany new packaging for Colgate, the leading seller world-wide:&quot;If there was anything in the works, I couldn't tell youabout it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
