The LAS matrix-Nicalon fiber composites wereheat treated in air at 650 and 1000 C, the shear strength of the fiber/matrixinterface was characterized for individual fibers by an indentation technique,and the microstructure of the composites and the interface was examinedby analytical and transmission electron microscope. The bulk shear strengthwas measured using the short beam shear method. The results demonstratethat the embrittlement observed after 650 C exposure resulted from thedegradation of the carbon interfacial layer that was present initiallyand the formation of an SiO{sub 2}-rich layer, increasing the strengthof the fiber-matrix interface. However, except near free surfaces, the1000-C annealing treatment had little effect on the carbon-rich layer,and the weak interfacial bond persisted. 21 references.</TEXT></DOC>
