At least 115 abortion opponents were arrested Saturday inMilwaukee and Denver. Anti-abortion demonstrations in Massachusettsand Rhode Island were up-staged by pro-abortion-rights groups, andsome 900 people from both camps surrounded a California clinic in aprotest that was described as peaceful.   Protesters also gathered in Chicago, Miami, Phoenix, Jackson,Miss., and Vancouver, British Columbia, where the court's rulingdoes not have any effect.   Monday's U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding a Missouri lawrestricting abortion doesn't seem to have cooled the rhetoric.Abortion rights supporters see the ruling as a threat to overturnRoe vs. Wade, the 1973 case making abortions legal, while abortionopponents say the court didn't go far enough.   ``Babies are still being killed in America,'' said the Rev. DonSailer, a Baptist Minister from West Bend, Wis., at the protest inMilwaukee. He said anti-abortion protesters would face arrest andinjury for their cause.   In Denver, mounted police and canine teams bolstered police whoremoved Operation Rescue protesters Saturday morning after theytried to block entrances to a Planned Parenthood clinic. There waspushing and shoving as escorts locked arms, surrounded about fourpatients and helped them into the clinic.   The 60 arrested were charged with trespassing, disobedience of alawful order and loitering and were taken to the Denver County Jail,police said.   About 250 protesters stayed several hours more, walking along thesidewalk around the facility, signing hymns and praying, but byabout noon they had dispersed, police said.   Lisa Dotur, spokeswoman for Operation Rescue in Colorado,defended the altercations. ``People are deeply concerned aboutchildren who are in imminent danger of death,'' she said.   In Milwaukee, by midday 57 anti-abortion activists were arrestedas about 300 people on both sides of the issue demonstrated. Policesaid the arrested would be charged with disorderly conduct ortrespassing, or possibly both.   In Tustin, Calif., about 900 demonstrators surrounded the SantaAna-Tustin Medical Pavilion, which offers abortions among itsservices.   Acting Police Chief Fred Wakefield said there appreared to beequal numbers of protesters and counter-protesters. As of midday,the demonstation was described as orderly.   ``They are willing to stay there and shut the clinic down,'' saidJim Cuthbertson, spokesman for Operation Rescue. ``We'll stay thereas long as necessary.''   However, members of the Feminist Majority escorted patients andclinic staff into the clinic, said Kathy Spillar, the group'snational coordinator.   In Brookline, Mass., an expected anti-abortion protest turnedinto a rally for about 300 demonstrators for abortion rights, whocrowded sidewalks and the street near three abortion clinics whileabout a dozen anti-abortion activists handed out leaflets.   ``We got the word out,'' said Ellen Convisser, president of theBoston chapter of the National Organization for Women. ``We appearedand they didn't.''   A few minor scuffles took place outside one clinic, and policewere posted in force with arrest-wagons and ambulances. But bymidday no arrests or injuries were reported.   In Cranston, R.I., when a carload of anti-abortion demonstratorspulled up at a clinic and found close to 70 abortion rightsadvocates waiting for them. A clinic spokeswoman said the pro-lifeactivists decided to wait for reinforcements, who did not arrive.   Police Sgt. William Burroughs said the demonstration broke upabout at midmorning with no arrests.   Abortion rights demonstrators and their opponents faced off infront of a Chicago clinic before police arrested 61 people,physically removing many who blocked the building's doors.   About 200 people from each side chanted and sang as police hauledanti-abortion protesters from the entrance of the Michigan AvenueMedical Center for Women.   Most of those arrested were anti-abortion protesters blocking thedoor. They were charged with mob action and resisting arrest, saidDeputy Chief John Walsh.   Of 70 women who had appointments for gynecological servicesincluding abortions, about two-thirds showed up, said clinicspokesman Tom Masloski.   A two-hour standoff by abortion foes at Today's Woman MedicalCenter in Miami ended with 27 arrests, police said. Members ofOperation Rescue South Florida said they targeted the clinic becauseit allegedly performs abortions up to 24 weeks into pregnancy.   Part of the Missouri law upheld by the Supreme Court requiredmedical tests on any fetus thought to be at least 20 weeks old todetermine if it can survive on its own.   ``The Supreme Court has indicated that abortions after 20 weeksof viability testing may be illegal,'' said the Rev. PatrickMahoney, director of Operation Rescue. ``When we get arrested, thatwill be our defense.''   Most of the anti-abortion activists sprawled on the ground infront of the clinic and went limp when officers moved in to makearrests. About 100 abortion rights demonstrators picketed across thestreet.   In Phoenix, about 200 protesters gathered outside the MetroPhoenix Women's Clinic. No arrests were made but clinic employeessaid about 40 percent of their appointments were no-shows.   About 110 anti-abortion protesters peacefully picketed outsidethe Mississippi Women's Medical Clinic in Jackson, Miss.   In Vancouver, B.C., several anti-abortion protesters werearrested in front of a clinic in the second blockade of the facilitythis week. The protests were not related to the U.S. court's ruling.   The clinic, the only privately funded abortion facility inBritish Columbia, has been the site of protests since it opened lastyear.</TEXT></DOC>
