COLEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson said Monday he is pleasedwith many of the domestic provisions in the Democratic Partyplatform, but hinted that some foreign policy issues _ thePalestinian question in particular _ may be contested.   He said he is weighing a dozen possible issues that were leftout of the platform to bring up at the Democratic NationalConvention in Atlanta next month.   ``By and large, we got many of our campaign priorities in theplatform,'' Jackson said at a news conference at the annualconvention of Operation PUSH, the civil rights group he founded.``And we protected our right to ... protest or raise other issuesin Atlanta.''   His comments came after Democrats, meeting in Denver andWashington over the weekend, agreed to a platform draft and anoverhaul of party rules in a rare atmosphere of unity.   Jackson indicated that a call for the creation of a Palestinianhomeland _ rejected by the Dukakis forces for inclusion in theplatform _ might well be an issue at the convention.   ``Reasonable discussion on this matter should not alienateanyone,'' he said when asked whether such a plank might anger Jews.``We must put forth a formula that represents security for Israeland justice for Palestine, and peace for both.''   He declined to name the other issues his camp might bring to thefloor.   Jackson also continued to put himself forth as the one who mostdeserves to be offered the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket withMichael Dukakis.   Jackson said no senator or governor has achieved his broad baseof support, and ``no Democrat alive has registered as many votersas I have.''   On the platform, Jackson took credit for getting a number ofissues into the document, including a call for a comprehensiveanti-drug effort, a plank calling for designation of South Africaas a ``terrorist state,'' and a program of Third World development.</TEXT></DOC>
