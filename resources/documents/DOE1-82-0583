Chemical characterization shows thatthe purified conjugate contains 1 mol/mol of peptide covalently attachedto Tyr138 of calmodulin. The fluorescence intensity and anisotropy ofthe dityrosine moiety demonstrate that this novel derivative undergoesinteractions with calcium, smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase, andphenylagarose which are similar to those of unmodified calmodulin.</TEXT></DOC>
