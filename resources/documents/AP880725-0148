Shevardnadze saidMonday the Soviet legislature should oversee the defense industryand make decisions about how the armed forces are used abroad.   His remarks to a Kremlin foreign policy conference, reported bystate television, were an elaboration of proposals Soviet officialshave mentioned for expanding the powers of the legislature, theSupreme Soviet.   Shevardnadze said last month's Communist Party conference setthe stage for strengthening civilian control of the military.   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the conference of 5,000party members June 28 ``an effective constitutionally authorizedmechanism'' was needed for a ``businesslike and competentdiscussion of international issues.''   New legislative procedures would bring ``all departmentsoccupied with the military and military-industrial activity ...under the control of the highest all-people's elected organ,'' saida television announcer who paraphrased Shevardnadze's remarks. Thereference appeared to be to the Supreme Soviet.   Supreme control over the military now is believed in the handsof the Defense Council, which works in secret without revealing itsexact functions or membership. Official media have said Gorbachevleads the council.   Gorbachev proposed in his speech to the party conference that anew, stronger president take over the Defense Council and make keyforeign policy decisions.   Conference delegates supported his call for strengthening thelegislature by creating a 2,250-member Congress of People'sDeputies that would choose a smaller standing Supreme Soviet.   Shevardnadze said the new legislature should supervise ``use ofmilitary forces outside national borders of the country and plansfor defense construction and openness of military budgets,''according to the television report.   Bringing the legislature into decision-making on foreignmilitary activities may be an attempt to avoid repetition of whatsome Soviet officials say was the mistake of sending troops intoAfghanistan in December 1979.   They say only a few Soviet leaders approved the intervention anddid so without consulting specialists who would have advisedagainst it. The soldiers now are being withdrawn under an agreementmediated by the United Nations.   A Western military attache told The Associated Press the changesShevardnadze outlined reflect an effort to ``have more people havea say'' in military decisions.   Shevardnadze's remarks were reported only partially in thetelevision news program Vremya. A report of the foreign policymeeting by the Tass news agency did not include Shevardanadze'sproposals for wider oversight of the military.</TEXT></DOC>
