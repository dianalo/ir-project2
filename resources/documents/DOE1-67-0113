Thecrude protein content was 17.1 and 15.9%, resp., in the dry matter, thatof natively crude protein 10.6 and 9.4%, resp. During a 6-day N balanceperiod 8 and 16 g /sup 15/N-urea resp. with a /sup 15/N excess (/sup15/N') of 9.26 and 9.40 atom-% were fed orally instead of commercialfeeding urea. There were no significant differences between the two agegroups with regard to the digestibility of the organic matter and thecrude nutrients. The average N balance of 372 +- 85 mg/kg LW/sup 0.75//daywere in the intermediate range of N retention capacity and accountedfor 26 +- 5% of the consumed N. N retention in per cent. was slightlylower in younger lambs. Projections of urea utilization in a quasi stationarystate resulted in an efficiency of the utilization of 33 +- 4%. The cuttingup of the lambs at the end of the main period showed between 0.02 and0.22 atom-% /sup 15/N' in the total N, TCA precipitable N and amino acidN of the meat. At between 0.24 and 0.38 atom-% /sup 15/N' they were highestin the heart and jaw muscles. The quota of /sup 15/N' amounts found inthe total N of the meat were 10.6 +- 3% of the /sup 15/N intake and 20.1+- 5.1% of the /sup 15/N'amount remaining in the body. The bones contained7.7 +- 1.7% and the fleece 7.9 +- 3.1% of the /sup 15/N' intake. TotalN and urea utilization was slightly lower in younger lambs than in olderones.</TEXT></DOC>
