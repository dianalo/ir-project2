There are two methods of conservativetreatment: limited surgery with or without auxiliary dissection followedby irradiation and irradiation as the primary treatment. Depending onthe size of the primary tumor and clinical findings in the axillae, patientswere referred to either of the two treatment alternatives. Generally,limited surgery and irradiation was performed in patients with earlybreast carcinomas, while irradiation as the primary treatment was usedfor more locally advanced cancers. Since 1960, conservative treatmentswith megavoltage for patients with invasive breast carcinomas have beenused more and more frequently. These conservation methods have been usedhoping to achieve long-term survival comparable to that obtained by mastectomyand breast preservation with good cosmetic results. This chapter reviewsresults at 5 and 10 years obtained in Europe by several authors concerningearly breast infiltration carcinomas treated by limited surgery or withoutaxillary dissection followed by irradiation.</TEXT></DOC>
