The effectiveheat transfer coefficient is a strong function of hydrogen pressure inthe reactor. The reaction rate is a function of the temperature, thehydrogen pressure and the hydrogen to metal ratio in the solid phase.An unreacted-core reaction model fits the reaction rate data very well.5 refs., 3 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
