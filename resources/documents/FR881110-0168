Activities include demonstrations, outreach,experimental, research and training projects, and research institutes.<T3>Applicable Regulations: </T3>(a) The Education Department General AdministrativeRegulations (EDGAR), 34 CFR Parts 74, 75, 77, 79, and 80, and (b) The HandicappedChildren's Early Education Program, 34 CFR Part 309, as amended August11, 1987 (52 FR 29816).<T3>Priorities: </T3>The Secretary announces, pursuant to 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3),the following priorities for the Handicapped Children's Early EducationProgram. The Secretary will give an absolute preference under this programto applications that respond to the following priorities; that is, theSecretary will select for funding only those applications that meet thesepriorities.<ITAG tagnum="81">Priority 1. Nondirected Demonstrations (CFDA No. 84.024)</ITAG>This priority supports demonstration projects that develop, implement,and evaluate new or improved approaches for serving young children withhandicaps (ages birth through eight). Projects funded under this prioritymust design models that allow young children with handicaps to achievetheir optimal functioning level within normalized, nonsegregated environments.Applications must describe (1) the specific service problem or issue thatthe project will address; (2) the specific components or procedures ofthe model and the rationale, based on theory, research, or practice evaluation,for those components or procedures; (3) the specific types of studentsparticipating in the project (i.e., age, handicapping condition or diagnosis,level of functioning) and (4) an evaluation design that includes functionaloutcome measures for the young children with handicaps who participatein the proposed intervention(s). Final reports submitted by projects fundedunder this priority must include both the specific findings of the projectas well as general principles that have been learned or tested for developinginterventions for young children with handicaps. Quantifiable informationfrom project evaluation activities must also be included along with preciseinformation regarding the procedures for the interventions and the contextsin which they were implemented as well as available cost information.The Secretary particularly invites applications for demonstration projectsthat develop models for delivering, coordinating, or supplementing neededdevelopmental, special educational, or related services to infants, toddlers,or preschool-aged children with handicaps who are in day-care programs(home-based, center-based, or home or center based in conjunction withpart-day special education preschool programs). This invitational priorityresponds to the growing number of young children, including children withhandicaps, who are placed in day-care services to accommodate the child-careneeds of working parents. However, applications that meet this invitationalpriority will not receive a competitive preference over applications fordemonstration projects that develop, implement, and evaluate new or improvedapproaches for serving young children with handicaps (ages birth througheight).<ITAG tagnum="81">Priority 2. Nondirected Experimental Projects (CFDA No. 84.024)</ITAG>This priority supports investigations of alternative interventions or approachesfor serving infants, toddlers, or preschool-aged children with handicaps.Interventions selected for comparison must include those for which informationis unavailable regarding their relative effectiveness for particular groupsof children or within particular settings or conditions. Projects supportedunder this priority must:(1) Compare the alternative interventions or approaches in typical servicesettings;(2) Conduct the investigations using methodological procedures that willproduce unambigious findings regarding the relative effectiveness of thealternative strategies as well as any findings as to interaction effectsbetween particular approaches and particular groups of children or particularcontexts; and(3) Include dissemination activities that will lead to improved servicesfor infants, toddlers, or preschool-aged children with handicaps.Applications must describe (1) the specific problem or issue that the projectwill address; (2) the specific approaches or interventions that will becompared or validated, including the rationale for selecting particularapproaches and previous evaluation information regarding these approaches;(3) specifically, the children targeted by the project (i.e., age, handicappingcondition or diagnosis, level of functioning); and (4) an evaluation designthat includes functional outcome measures for the young children with handicapsor their families who participate in the proposed intervention(s). Finalreports submitted by projects funded under this priority must include boththe specific findings of the project as well as general principles thathave been learned or tested for developing interventions for young childrenwith handicaps. Quantifiable information from project evaluation activitiesmust also be included along with precise information regarding the proceduresfor the interventions and the contexts in which they were implemented aswell as available cost information.The Secretary particularly invites applications that compare alternativeapproaches to assessing family strengths and needs as part of the processfor developing the individualized family service plans (IFSP) requiredunder Part H of the Education of the Handicapped Act. Such projects couldcompare approaches, instruments, or tools commonly used for family assessmentacross disciplines or within a single discipline to determine their relativeeffects on the strength and needs identified, on the process for developingthe IFSP, on the document itself, and on the satisfaction of participantsin the planning process, including families of infants and toddlers withhandicaps. However, applications that meet the invitational priority willnot receive a competitive preference over other applications for projectsthat investigate alternative interventions or approaches for serving infants,toddlers, or preschool-aged children with handicaps.<T3>Eligible Applicants: </T3>Public agencies and nonprofit private organizationsmay apply for an award under any of the priorities.<T3>For Applications or Information Contact: </T3>Susan Fowler or JosephClair, Office of Special Education Programs, Division of Educational Services,U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., (Switzer Building,Room 4620-2644), Washington, DC 20202.

To assist potential applicantsthe Department has assembled the following most commonly asked questions.In general these questions and answers are applicable to all direct grantcompetitions covered by this combined application package. Q. Can we get an extension of the deadline?A. No. A closing date may be changed only under extraordinary circumstances.Any change must be announced in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and apply to <T3>all </T3>applications. Waivers for individual applications <T3>cannot </T3>be granted, regardless of the circumstances. Q. How many copies of the application should I submit and must they bebound?A. Current Government-wide policy is that only an original and two copiesneed be submitted. The binding of applications is optional. At least onecopy should be left unbound to facilitate any necessary reproduction. Applicantsshould not use foldouts, photographs, or other materials that are hardto duplicate. Q. We just missed the deadline for the XXX competition. May we submit underanother competition?A. Yes, but it may not be worth the postage. A properly prepared applicationshould meet the specifications of the competition to which it is submitted.Q. I'm not sure which competition is most appropriate. What should I do?A. We are happy to discuss the questions with you and provide clarificationon the unique elements of the various competitions. Q. Will you help us prepare our application?A. We are happy to provide general program information. Clearly, it wouldnot be appropriate for staff to participate in the actual writing of anapplication, but we can respond to specific questions about applicationrequirements, evaluation criteria, and the priorities. Applicants shouldunderstand that this previous contact is not required, nor does it guaranteethe success of the application. Q. When will I find out if I'm going to be funded?A. You can expect to receive notification within 3 to 4 months of the applicationclosing date, depending on the number of applications received and thenumber of competitions with closing dates at about the same time. Q. Once my application has been reviewed by the review panel, can you tellme the outcome?A. No. Every year we are called by a number of applicants who have legitimatereasons for needing to know the outcome of the review prior to officialnotification. Some applicants need to make job decisions, some need tonotify a local school district, etc. Regardless of the reason, becausefinal funding decisions have not been made at that point, we cannot shareinformation about the review with <T3>anyone </T3>reviewed under a different competition from the one youintended. Q. Will my application be returned if I am not funded?A. We no longer return original copies of unsuccessful applications. Thus,applicants should retain at least one copy of the application. Copies ofreviewer comments will be mailed to applicants who are not successful.Q. How should my application be organized?A. The application narrative should be organized to follow the exact sequenceof the components in the selection criteria of the regulations pertainingto the specific program competition for which the application is prepared.In each instance, a table of contents and a one-page abstract summarizingthe objectives, activities, project participants, and expected outcomesof the proposed project should precede the application narrative. Q. Is travel allowed under these projects?A. Travel associated with carrying out the project is allowed (i.e. travelfor data collection, etc.). Because we may request the principal investigatoror director of funded projects to attend an annual meeting, you may alsowish to include a trip to Washington, DC in the travel budget. Travel conferencesis sometimes allowed when it is for the purpose of dissemination. Q. If my application receives a high score from the reviewer, does thatmean that I will receive funding?A. No. It is often the case that the number of applications scored highlyby or approved by the reviewers exceeds the dollars available for fundingprojects under a particular competition. The order of selection, whichis based on the scores of the applications and other relevant factors,determines the applications that can be funded. Q. What happens during negotiations?A. During negotiations, technical and budget issues may be raised. Theseare issues that have been identified during panel and staff review andrequire clarification. Sometimes issues are stated as ``conditions.'' Theseare issues that have been identified as so critical that the award cannotbe made unless those conditions are met. Questions may also be raised aboutthe proposed budget. Generally, these issues are raised because there isinadequate justification or explanation of a particular budget item, orbecause the budget item seems unimportant to the successful completionof the project. If you are asked to make changes that you feel could seriouslyaffect the project's success, you may provide reasons for not making thechanges or provide alternative suggestions. Similarly, if proposed budgetreductions will, in your opinion, seriously affect the project activities,you may explain why and provide additional justification for the proposedexpenses. An award cannot be made until all negotiation issues have beenresolved. Q. If my application is successful can I assume I will get the estimated/projectedbudget amounts in subsequent years?A. No. The estimate for subsequent year project costs is helpful to usfor planning purposes but it in no way represents a commitment for a particularlevel of funding in subsequent years. Grantees having a multi-year projectwill be asked to submit a continuation application and a detailed budgetrequest prior to each year of the project.Q. What is a cooperative agreement and how does it differ from a grant?A. A cooperative agreement is similar to a grant in that its principalpurpose is to provide assistance for a public purpose of support or stimulationas authorized by a Federal statute. A cooperative agreement differs froma grant because of the substantial involvement anticipated between theexecutive agency (in this case the Department of Education) and the recipientduring the performance of the contemplated activity.Q. Is the procedure for applying for a cooperative agreement differentfrom the procedure for applying for a grant?A. No. If the Department of Education determines that a given award shouldbe made by cooperative agreement rather than a grant, the applicant willbe advised at the time of negotiation of any special procedures that mustbe followed.Q. How do I provide an assurance?A. Simply state in writing that you are meeting a prescribed requirement.Q. How long should an application be?A. The Department of Education is making a concerted effort to reduce thevolume of paperwork in discretionary program applications. The scope andcomplexity of projects is too variable to establish firm limits on length.Your application should provide enough information to allow the reviewpanel to evaluate the significance of the project against the criteriaof the competition. It is helpful to include in the appendices such informationas:(1) Staff qualifications. These should be brief. They should include theperson's title and role in the proposed project and contain only informationrelevant to the proposed project. Qualifications of consultants and advisorycouncil members should be provided and be similarly brief.(2) Assurance of participation of an agency other than the applicant ifsuch participation is critical to the project, including copies of evaluationinstruments proposed to be used in the project in instances where suchinstruments are not in general use.Q. How can I be sure that my application is assigned to the correct competition?A. Applicants should clearly indicate in Block 10 of the face page of theirapplication (Standard form 424) the CFDA number and the title of the programpriority (e.g., 84.023) representing the competition in which the applicationshould be considered. If this information is not provided, your applicationmay inadvertently be assigned and Q. Where can copies of the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> program regulations, and federal statutes beobtained?A.
