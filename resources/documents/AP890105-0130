Recommendations by the National Academy of Sciences and itsaffiliated National Academy of Engineering and National Institute ofMedicine, in the form of white papers commissioned by the presidentsof the organizations, included:   _Development of a comprehensive plan to finance care for thosesuffering from Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, and legislationto ban discrimination against them. The contagious disease attacksthe body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting otherdiseases and infections.   _Reduction in use of fossil fuels, to slow the ``greenhouseeffect'' warming of the planet. They also advocated stepped-upresearch into non-fossil energy sources such as a ``publiclyacceptable'' nuclear reactor, and urged increased energy efficiencythroughout the economy.   _Swift selection of a chief for the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration, coupled with making the space effort a $10billion-a-year base operation augmented by separately financedspecial efforts, such as the space station, which might add $3billion to $4 billion in peak years.   _Early naming of a science adviser to help select dozens of keyscientific executives throughout the government, sort outcontroversy among competiting weapons systems, rebuildcompetitiveness of the nation's technologies and reverse decliningscientific and technical education.   In a cover letter to Bush, the presidents of the threeorganizations said that ``global environmental change must be mademore prominent in the scientific, political and foreign policyagendas of the United States.''   The groups released white papers in the areas of the environment,AIDS, space and science policy by special study panels.   Regarding space research, the panel told Bush the United Statescannot take a leading position without his help.   ``To give visibility to the importance of his space program, thepresident must establish his goals early in his administration. Heshould then support them strongly with the public and the Congressto help ensure their achievement,'' the experts said.   On AIDS, the panel urged the Bush administration to protect thoseinfected with the deadly virus from discrimination and ensure thatscreening tests for the disease be employed ``only when theirpurposes are clear and their results productive.''   The AIDS study also said Bush should continue aggressiveeducational programs and develop a plan for financing care of AIDSvictims. It urged the United States to be a leader in theinternational battle against AIDS and increase contributions to theglobal program to $50 million a year by 1990 from the current $15million.   The space panel said it believed a space station ``is essentialto establish the feasibility of extended human space flight'' if thenation wants to pursue it. But the concept of a space station ``willrequire revalidation to ensure that it fully supports the goalsestablished by the president.''   Bush has said he favors the space station.   The space panel also urged a study of turning over to privateoperators more of NASA's field activities such as the Marshall SpaceFlight Center at Huntsville, Ala., perhaps along the lines of theNASA-owned Jet Propulsion Laboratory operated by the CaliforniaInstitute of Technology.   The environment panel said natural gas should be favored overother fossil fuels in the short run because it releases less carbondioxide than other fuels, but ``we should explore means for reducingenergy demand without impeding economic growth, for example, byusing fossil fuels with greater efficiency.''   Carbon dioxide is increasing in the atmosphere at about 0.3percent per year and accounts for about half the expected warming oftwo degrees Fahrenheit to nine degrees the academy expects in thenext century.   Provisions of the treaty reducing emissions of chemicals thatdestroy the ozone layer should be accelerated and a complete ban onthose chemicals sought, the panel said. These chlorofluorocarboncompounds also worsen the greenhouse effect. The EnvironmentalProtection Agency already has called for such a ban.</TEXT></DOC>
