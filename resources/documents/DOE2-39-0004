The kappa-epsilon two-equation turbulence modelwas used to predict gas fields in the combustion furnace. Fuel particleflights were determined to analyze the spray behaviors and the eddy dissipationmodel was used to get reaction rate between gasified fuel oil and oxygen.Both fuel NOx and thermal NOx were considered for combustion of fuelcontaining nitrogen such as fuel oil C. The flux model was used to calculatethe radiative heat transfer between the wall and the gas field. The predictedgas temperature and composition in fuel oil combustion agreed well withexperimental results. (6 figs, 3 tabs, 21 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
