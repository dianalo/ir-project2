Fathi Arafat, head of the Palestinian RedCrescent volunteer emergency health service, attended theopening session of the two-week World Health Assembly.   The U.S., which provides over a quarter of WHO's annualbudget, has threatened to stop its contributions if the PLObid, due for discussion Thursday, is successful. A similarbid last year failed following strong Washington opposition.   China's Health Minister Chen Minzhang told the openingsession that global economic problems threatened the healthof large population groups. &quot;In many countries there havebeen cuts in health budgets and living standards havedeteriorated,&quot; said Mr. Chen, the assembly's outgoingchairman.                                                                                                          UNDELIVERED GERMAN MAIL                                                                                                          Strikes at West Germany's post office and printing pressesspread yesterday, leaving mail boxes empty, telephone officesabandoned and many newspapers cut down to skeleton editions.More than 10,000 postal workers are on strike across thecountry to back demands that their hourly work break shouldbe extended from six to 10 minutes. The strike started lastweek. In Hamburg alone, a quarter of a million letters wereleft undelivered, the postal workers' union said.                                                                                                          SAVING PERU'S TREASURES                                                                                                          The U.S. has barred importation of archaeologicaltreasures from Peru in a bid to cut into the illegal sale ofsuch artifacts, the White House announced. &quot;The United Statesbelieves that the illegal trade in cultural property doesimmense damage to our hemispheric cultural heritage,&quot; WhiteHouse spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. He said the ban wasimposed to help curb looting in the Sipan region of Peru,following a request from the Lima government.                                                                                                          SETBACK FOR ITALY'S COMMUNISTS                                                                                                          The Italian Communist Party suffered a severe setback inregional elections, its first nationwide test since thecollapse of communism in Eastern Europe. Early projectionsshowed the party's vote falling to 23.5% in the electionsSunday and yesterday -- its worst showing for more than 30years -- from 28.6% during European elections last year and30.2% in the last regional election in 1985.                                                                                                          NEW ZEALAND MERGER                                                                                                          MCI Communications Corp. of the U.S. and Bell CanadaEnterprises Inc. are merging their New Zealandtelecommunications joint ventures. Last year, MCI formed acompany with New Zealand Railways Corp. and Todd Corp., aclosely held industrial and investment concern. Bell Canada'sBell Canada International unit set up a separate venture withTelevision New Zealand. The new companies were formed afterNew Zealand deregulated the telecommunications market toallow competition with Telecom Corp., the state-ownedtelephone company. The government is selling Telecom as partof a program to raise funds to repay debt.                                                                                                          TURKEY ABANDONS A PROJECT                                                                                                          Turkey abandoned a plan for a Japanese-led consortium tobuild a $1 billion thermal-power plant on the Aegean coast.Turkish enviromentalists had actively opposed the projectsince last October, when the consortium was awarded acontract to build the 1,000-megawatt plant in Aliaga. Theconsortium was led by Japan's Electric Power Development Co.and also included Turkey's state-owned Electricity Authority.Yesterday's decision came after a major demonstration byenvironmentalists in Aliaga.                                                                                                          HONG KONG'S CAPITAL OUTFLOW                                                                                                          Hong Kong's capital outflow surged after the bloodshed inBeijing June 4, to 22.39 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$2.87billion) for 1989, Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp.estimated.   If that rate persists, local economic growth will beslowed, the bank said in its April economic report. The bank,Hong Kong's largest, said there has been mild private capitaloutflow since 1984 but that it picked up significantly afterBeijing's bloody suppression of the Chinese pro-democracymovement last June.   The bank estimated 1988's outflow to be around HK$2.034billion and put 1984's at HK$8.949 billion.   The bank concluded that before the local confidence crisisis resolved, the capital flight will continue and thedraining of funds from the local economy will continue tohamper growth.

West German Nazi-hunters paid $310,000 for informationthat led to the capture of Josef Schwammberger, who wasbrought back to Germany from Argentina last week and facestrial on charges of murdering Jews at several camps inPoland.
