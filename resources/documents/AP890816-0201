These days, he starts his day poring over the real estateads in The Washington Post.   Nyamdoo, Mongolia's first ambassador to the United States, islooking for an embassy building and residence befitting his ancientnation, which gave rise to the 13th century warrior Genghis Khan.   His country, sandwiched between China and the Soviet Union, hasbeen synonymous with remoteness and isolation for hundreds of years.   No more. Mongolia is making its debut on Washington's diplomaticstage with an ambassador who is not your typical, ``stiff upperlip'' diplomat.   When he went to present his credentials to President Bush threemonths ago, Nyamdoo took along his infant grandson. He and his wifecare for the baby, ``and there was nowhere to leave him,'' Nyamdoosaid in an interview.   He drives his own car _ a chauffeur is not in the budget yet _and lives in a Belle Epoque apartment house that has seen betterdays. His deputy lives in an adjacent apartment, and the livingquarters are also used as offices.   But Nyamdoo is sufficiently savvy to have learned one of thefirst rules of Washington success: a lobbyist is a virtual must. Hehas retained the firm of Van Kloberg and Associates to help him getsettled, introduce him around town and promote investment inMongolia.   His English has the distinct rolling intonation of a Russianaccent, the legacy of five years of university in Moscow where hestudied international law. The subject of his doctoral desertationwas one he knows well: landlocked countries.   Mongolia, once the seat of a warrior empire that extended to theshores of the Danube River, established diplomatic relations withthe United States in 1987. ``It was high time,'' Nyamdoo said in aninterview.   About 100 other countries have diplomatic ties with Mongolia,which became the world's second communist nation when it declaredindependence in 1924, but only about 20 maintain residentambassadors there. The U.S. ambassador, Richard Williams, works atthe State Department and occasionally travels to visit severaljunior American diplomats who brave the harsh climate and lack ofWestern comforts to live and work in Ulan Bator, the capital.   Nyamdoo and his five brothers and sisters grew up on a farm inthe western part of the country, which spans an area the size ofWestern Europe but whose population is only 2 million.   ``I miss the rural life,'' said the 55-year-old envoy. ``We hadfive treasures: horses, cattle, camels, sheep and goats.''   In those days, it was easy for a bright youth to get a highschool and university education, he said. Mongolia had styled itselfon the Soviet model of centralized economic planning and a freeeducation for all.   Nowadays, with 70 percent of the population under the age of 30and shrinking Soviet aid, competition for university slots istougher, Nyamdoo said.   Mongolia has its version of perestroika and glasnost, the Sovietpolicies of economic restructuring and political openness, but inUlan Bator it's called ``shinechel'' or renewal.   ``You can say we have more freedom than in the United Statesnow,'' Nyamdoo said with a laugh.   The opening to the United States paralleled improving relationsbetween Mongolia and its giant neighbor to the south, China.Relations between Beijing and Ulan Bator were ruptured in the late1950s when Mongolia sided with the Soviet Union in its split withChina. But the recent thaw in Sino-Soviet relations encompassed theMongolians, as well.   In 1984, Nyamdoo was part of a Mongolian Foreign Ministry teamthat drafted an agreement with China to start normalizing relations.Here in Washington, he meets with his Chinese counterpart as well aswith Ambassador Williams, who is also in charge of the StateDepartment's China office.   Nyamdoo would like more U.S. recognition of his country,specifically through a meeting between his foreign minister andSecretary of State James Baker. ``The level of diplomatic relationsis too low now,'' he said.   U.S. officials characterize the relationship as modest but off toa good start.   Trade with the United States runs at about $3 million annually,mostly Mongolian exports of cashmere and wool. Hundreds of Americanhunters go on safaris to hunt rams in the frozen wastelands of theGobi Desert.   Nyamdoo would like U.S. investment in Mongolia, possibly in theform of joint ventures. Already a team representing petroleumcompanies visited Mongolia this summer to examine the prospects foroil exploration in the mineral-rich country, he said.   But for Nyamdoo, the most pressing need is an embassy building.His efforts are complicated by a standoff with the State Departmentover land for a U.S. chancery in Ulan Bator.   In accordance with diplomatic practice, Mongolia cannot set up anembassy here until the United States gets the land for its chanceryin Ulan Bator.   But the State Department has picked out a lot used by a Mongoliannaturalist society and refuses to settle for another space, Nyamdoosaid. ``I am stubborn, too. We will see,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 20</NOTE></DOC>
