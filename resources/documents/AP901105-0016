Now they are resigning themselves to the possibilityof war with Iraq.   ``If there's no peace, I'd rather have war than have SaddamHussein threatening myself and my children,'' said a Saudi sheikwho lived through Riyadh's transformation from backwater toglittering metropolis.   Recounting the rags-to-riches story of his generation, themiddle-aged sheik-businessman said ``nobody wants war'' buteveryone is becoming resigned to it.   Few signs of impending war are evident in this city ofsuperhighways, but posters telling what do in an air raid can befound at traffic intersections among the modern buildings, myriadprincely palaces and shiny mosques.   Stay at home, they urge. Use minimum lighting. Place yourself ina corner or go underground if you have a basement. Listen carefullyto radio or television. Be calm and behave wisely.   Abdel-Aziz bin Abdel-Rahman al Saud, after years of exile inKuwait, stormed out of the desert in 1902 with a few hand-pickedcompanions and took the fort at Riyadh in a daring dawn raid.   Within two decades, he controlled most of the Arabian Peninsula.   His victory was so complete that war on their own soil issomething only very old Saudis can remember, and only dimly.   Out at Diriyah oasis, where the ultra-conservative Islamic sectknown as the Wahabis joined forces with Abdel-Aziz's ancestors toplan an earlier conquest of Arabia in the 18th century, cats slinkacross empty streets as the sun sets over the desert.   Behind a dense palm grove are the big-walled compounds wheresome of the wives of senior princes live. Al-Turaif Citadel, amud-brick fort that guarded the entrance to the oasis, is beingrestored as a historic monument.   Modern-day Saudis live in the sprawl of Riyadh, the capital,which is laid out in a grid pattern across the flat desert. Theyseldom visit the citadel, a relic of the warrior past.   A Jordanian businessman, who like the saudi sheik spoke oncondition of anonymity, told of noticing fear in many Saudisimmediately after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.   ``Over the past 20 years, the people have been living inluxury,'' he said. ``All of a sudden, they were in a war mood.   ``They're very afraid of Saddam. They have seen the Kuwaitiscoming here, sleeping in schools, five to a room. They're worriedit could happen to them.''   ``In the early days of the crisis, they packed their houses withfood, water and so on,'' the Jordanian said, but now they are morerelaxed and ``there's no such mood.''   Whatever the people's private fears, their ruler insists that,through diplomacy or war, Saddam be driven out of Kuwait.   King Fahd bin Abdel-Aziz, the current successor of Abdel-Aziz,is one of his more than 30 sons. Fahd also is known as Custodian ofthe Two Holy Shrines, Mecca and Medina.   In public statements, Fahd has demanded unconditional withdrawalfrom Kuwait and ruled out any compromise that would leave parts ofthe tiny emirate under Iraq control.   Saudi Arabia, which has been reluctant to thrust itself onto theArab or international scene, is assuming a greater role now andseems less willing to compromise with its neighbors.   When King Hussein of Jordan refused wholehearted backing ofanti-Iraqi measures, the kingdom criticized him severely and, for atime, closed the border to commercial traffic.   When Yemen gave partial support to Saddam, the Saudis expelledhundreds of thousands of Yemeni workers, many of whom had been inthe kingdom 30 years or more.   A Western diplomat said the new policy was: ``No more Mr. NiceGuy. No more throwing of money at problems until they go away.''   Among the Saudi middle class, he said, there is a ``growingdebate about, `Is it worth going to war?' Also, if you go afterSaddam, does he have to be personally eliminated or could he justbe defanged?''   The sheik-businessman said: ``If there is a war, the impact willlast many years. The Americans, the British will stay for a while,then they'll leave, but the Iraqis will be there forever.''   He said there was only one good solution: ``We wake up tomorrowand Saddam Hussein has had a heart attack and been toppled bysomeone less dangerous.''</TEXT></DOC>
