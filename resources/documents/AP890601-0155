Gorbachev have beena mixed blessing for the Soviet environmental movement, exposingproblems but creating economic obstacles to righting past wrongs,says a Soviet environmentalist.   Until Gorbachev instituted a policy of glasnost, or greateropenness, discussion of ecological problems had been suppressed inthe Soviet Union for decades, said Arvids Ulme, president of theLatvian Environmental Club, known in Latvia as VAK.   Ulme, However, told U.S. officials in meetings late last week to``look at perestroika in a different way, to realize that there isa downside to perestroika,'' the Russian word for economicrestructuring.   ``The economic reforms are speeding up the destruction of theenvironment because they are aimed primarily at saving theeconomy,'' Ulme said in an interview with The Associated Press.   Economic resources are tight, and enterprises that for the firsttime must be self-supporting find they have little to spare forenvironmental clean-up, he said. Moreover, the emphasis is onincreasing production.   VAK is representative of the ``green'' movement of grass-rootspolitical organizations in the Soviet Union _ the Baltic republicsof Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in particular _ whereenvironmental complaints go hand in hand with nationalist concerns.   ``Those protesting the country's environmental ills have manyother complaints against the regime,'' Central Intelligence Agencyanalyst Christine Westbrook wrote last December in the ChristianScience Monitor.   The environmental issue is one of many that have their roots inthe forced annexation of the Baltic republics by Moscow duringWorld War II. The United States does not honor that annexation.   ``The refusal to recognize the legitimacy of the forcedincorporation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into the Sovietempire has been a longstanding and fundamental tenet of Americanpolicy toward the Soviet Union,'' Deputy Assistant Secretary ofState Paula J. Dobriansky reaffirmed in a March 11 speech that wassubsequently issued as a policy paper.   The administration, she said, would seek to ``establish andmaintain regular contact with a range of emerging political, socialand ecological informal groups in the Baltic states.''   The Baltic environmental groups comprise key components of widernational front movements that far outpolled local Communist Partiesin March 26 elections for the national Congress of People'sDeputies, which convened a week ago in Moscow.   Ulme's group contends that Kremlin economic policy not onlypollutes the environment, but also threatens native populations.   ``It's genocide,'' he said.   Moscow-based ministries make decisions affecting about 90percent of the economic activity in each of the 15 Sovietrepublics, and that includes the heavy polluting industries,according to published speeches by Communist Party officials fromthe Baltic republics.   Gaining control of those enterprises lies at the heart of theBaltic drive to achieve greater autonomy from Moscow, said Ulme.   The Kremlin thus far has balked at attempts by Estonia andLithuania to assert greater autonomy, but the ``greens'' have hadsome success.   An estimated 6,000 people demonstrated last Sept. 17 at theIgnalina atomic power station in Lithuania, and the movement latercollected 600,000 signatures protesting construction of a thirdreactor at the site. Official Soviet media credits the campaignwith stopping the third unit.   VAK and other environmental groups organized protests of morethan 100,000 people last Sept. 3 to protest pollution of the Gulfof Riga, and they successfully battled construction of ahydroelectric project at Daugavpils and construction of a subwaysystem in the Latvian capital of Riga.   Ulme said that VAK opposed the subway not because members wereagainst mass transportation, but because the construction, likeother major industrial projects, would require the immigration oflarge numbers of Russian workers.   ``It would employ 50,000 workers, and they would benon-Latvians,'' said Ulme. The construction of major enterprises inLatvia already has caused such a huge immigration that Latvians nowconstitute only about 50 percent of the population. The percentagesare about 80 percent in Lithuania and 60 percent in Estonia.   Latvian environmentalists are now trying to close down or cleanup an oil refinery built with help from the U.S. Occidental OilCorp. in the port city of Ventspils, where residents are afflictedby skin and respiratory problems of epidemic proportions, accordingto accounts in the Soviet press.</TEXT></DOC>
