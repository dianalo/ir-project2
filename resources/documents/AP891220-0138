Then as now, the declared goal was to protectAmerican citizens.   But the similarities between the American landing on theCaribbean island of Grenada on Oct. 25, 1983 _ the last time U.S.troops were sent on an invasion _ and Wednesday's Americanintervention in Panama are mostly superficial.   Both were described as pre-emptive operations, but logisticallyand strategically they are largely different.   The invasion of Grenada, spearheaded by 1,900 Marines and ArmyRangers, was undertaken with the stated purpose of protecting thelives of more than 600 American medical students from a Marxistgovernment that had taken the island's government by force Oct. 19.   President Bush, too, said he had ordered U.S. troops into Panamato protect the lives of Americans, this time an estimated 35,000,many of them soldiers.   The presidential statements justifying the invasions was similar.   Said Reagan in 1983:   ``The United States' objectives are clear: to protect our owncitizens, to facilitate the evacuation of those who want to leave,and to help in the restoration of democratic institutions inGrenada.''   Said Bush on Wednesday:   ``The Panamanian people want democracy, peace, and the chancefor a better life in dignity and freedom. The people of the UnitedStates seek only to support them in pursuit of these noble goals.''   In Panama, U.S. forces were under orders to capture ManuelAntonio Noriega, the country's ruler who is under indictment inFlorida on drug-trafficking charges.   While both presidents said they were acting to restoredemocratic governments, the Grenada operation had broader regionalimplications.   Reagan had grown increasingly concerned since 1981 about what heperceived as a Cuban and Soviet military buildup on Grenada.   The U.S. invasion was lent legitimacy by a request from six tinyeastern Caribbean nations for U.S. help to stop the militarybuildup, which they believed could endanger their democraticgovernments.   Indeed, the U.S. force was accompanied by 300 police officersand defense forces from four of Grenada's Caribbean neighbors.   Although plans for both operations were long in the making _ theGrenada invasion replicated a 1981 exercise _ the landing onGrenada was much more of a surprise to the world. Many peopledidn't even know how to pronounce the name of the nutmeg-producingisland and its new leader, Bernard Coard, while years of U.S.clashes with the defiant and provocative Noriega have become almostlegend.   The surprise six years ago was compounded by a lack ofinformation about the operation in Grenada because of a completeDefense Department news blackout. Reporters were given access tothe island only on the fifth day.   The fighting in Panama was closely covered from the start by theresident news corps and, hours after the fighting began, by a poolof U.S. reporters flown there by the Pentagon.   In Panama, the U.S. invasion was supported and prepared by some13,000 troops already stationed at American bases there. InGrenada, there were no U.S. military personnel on hand before theinvasion.   ``The logistics of getting there were much harder,'' saidLanghorne A. Motley, who served as assistant secretary of state forinter-American affairs at the time of the Grenada invasion.   The handkerchief-size Grenada _ 8 by 18 miles with a populationof less than 100,000 _ was a less complicated target than Panama,with its 30,000 square miles and population of 2.3 million.   ``Panama is a much messier place to operate, with Americansscattered around the country'' and a professional, U.S.-trainedmilitary, Motley said.   In Grenada, the U.S. force _ which at the height of the invasionnumbered about 7,000 _ encountered a military force of severalthousand Soviet-armed troops, aided by about 600 armed Cubans thereto construct a 9,500-foot airport runway that the United Statessaid had no civilian use.   Nineteen Americans were killed in Grenada, several of them inaccidents, as well as 24 Grenadans, most of them when U.S. planesmistakenly bombed a mental hospital. Also killed were 24 Cubans.   The actual fighting for control of the island lasted about 36hours, said Otto Reich, a diplomat who headed the State Departmentcampaign to enlist public support for the Grenada operation. U.S.troops stayed about seven weeks to defend the interim governmentand clean up pockets of Cuban resistance.   ``But there was no real urban warfare, unlike Panama,'' saidReich.</TEXT></DOC>
