John C. Danforth,R-Mo., said after the vote. But he and other supporters said a moremoderate version still had a chance of passage later this year ifPresident Reagan's veto is sustained.   Reagan, who has vowed repeatedly to veto the bill unless hisobjections were met, was asked what he planned to do with themeasure as he greeted Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney for astate dinner at the White House.   ``Just what I promised,'' he replied.   Some of the bill's major provisions would require theadministration to retaliate against unfair trading practices byother nations and streamline procedures for imposing curbs onimports.   Sponsors said the bill's main downfall was a plan to requireemployers to give notice of plant closings and major layoffs.Danforth said trying to carry the bill in the Senate with thatfeature ``was like swimming the English Channel and you get about amile out and someone hands you a 500-pound barbell and says, here,carry this.''   Democratic leaders also were unable to unsnarl a dispute overthe bill's curbs on Alaskan oil exports and thus failed in aneffort to win over that state's disgruntled Republican senators. Inthe end, 11 Republicans defied the White House and voted for themeasure.   One Democrat voted against the bill, retiring Sen. WilliamProxmire of Wisconsin, who said he was concerned over the bill'seasing of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.   The White House itself brought heavy lobbying pressure to headoff any recurrence of last week's defeat in the House, where themeasure passed by more than a veto-proof margin. Most waveringRepublicans ended up opposing the bill.   Deputy White House Press Secretary B.J. Cooper said that ``basedon today's vote, the numbers are there'' to sustain a veto, butadded, ``We will continue working with both houses to make surethat when the veto goes up that it is sustained.''   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter said: ``I amencouraged by today's Senate vote and optimistic that thepresident's veto of the omnibus trade bill will be sustained.'' Buthe added that it ``would be tragic'' if lawmakers did not try for amore moderate version.   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, toldreporters he would work to override the president's veto. But hesaid it was ``obvious that the odds are against us.''   He said any new version of the bill would have to be very muchlike the current one but with the plant-closings provision andperhaps the Alaskan oil export curbs removed.   One wavering Republican who supported the bill the first timearound, Sen. David Karnes, R-Neb., went to the White House and metfor 30 minutes with President Reagan, Vice President Bush, chief ofstaff Howard Baker, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III andEnergy Secretary Donald Hodel.   He emerged from the session expressing concern over duty-freeimports of ethanol from the Caribbean and saying ``what I neededwas the president's assurance that the administration was going tointroduce another bipartisan bill that could be quickly passed bythe Congress and signed.''   ``And I think he has done that,'' Karnes said.   Before the vote, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., urged hiscolleagues to turn a deaf ear to ``the Japanese trade ministerwhining and complaining about'' the 1,000-page measure produced bya House-Senate conference committee.   ``He has no justification to say one word about because theyhave been cheating from A to Z in international trading with us foryears,'' Riegle said.   Reagan renewed his veto threat and promised to work later for amilder version in a letter Tuesday to Senate Minority Leader BobDole, R-Kan.   Reagan called on lawmakers to ``finish the trade bill process ina way that serves America's interests _ not the special interests.''   Most administration fire has been directed at a provision thatwould require all but the smallest companies to provide theiremployees with 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scalelayoffs.   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., defended the embattledplant-closings provision, saying 40,000 plants have shut down inthis decade of increased foreign competition.   ``Nearly 2 million people have lost their jobs each year,''Kennedy said. ``Yet the administration does not want workers toknow their jobs are in danger and to have time to plan for new waysto provide for their families.''   The administration dangled the prospect of a slimmed downversion of the bill, minus the plant-closings and perhaps otherprovisions, once Congress has sustained Reagan's expected veto ofthe current measure.   But Democratic leaders said this could be the last chance tosupport trade legislation before the fall election campaign.   The House passed the bill last Thursday, 312-107, more thanenough to override a veto.   The bill would overhaul the system under which the United Statesimposes import curbs and takes other steps to retaliate againstinternational trade violations and other unfair practices.   Authority to retaliate would be transferred from the presidentto the U.S. trade representative. Retaliation would be mandatorybut the bill provides five broadly phrased exceptions, such asthreats to national security.   Main provisions also streamline the means by which the UnitedStates imposes import restrictions to protect American businessesthreatened by surges in import competition.   But the 1,000-page measure contains hundreds of additionalprovisions, ranging from billions of dollars in agriculturalsubsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies.   Government aid to workers left jobless by import competitionwould be expanded. Trade sanctions would be imposed on Japan'sToshiba Corp., one of its subsidiaries and the Norwegian company ofKongsberg Vapenfabrikk for sale of submarine silencing equipment tothe Soviet Union.   The measure would assist Americans in defending themselvesagainst bribery charges brought under the Foreign Corrupt PracticesAct because of payments made by their agents overseas. It wouldease some export curbs on high-tech equipment subject torestriction because of its potential military uses.   A maze of minor provisions governs trade in everything fromcranberries to cantaloupes.   Several Republicans have expressed irritation at theadministration's heavy focus on the plant-closings provision as thereason to oppose the bill.   ``It puts Republicans on the side, at least the perception outthere, of being against the poor working man and women who get onlyfour-day notice,'' Dole said.</TEXT></DOC>
