 Conflicts between management, workers and qualitycontrol staff should be reduced; management should provide thenecessary leadership in order to successfully implement a processinvolving CASE.andP;  Many companies are depending on reengineering inorder to economically utilize code they already possess.andO;Reengineering and CASE are difficult to cost-justify because theyare seen as processes, not as direct facets of production.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer-Aided Software EngineeringManagement StyleProgram Development SoftwareReengineeringProgramming ManagementIndustry AnalysisProgram Development Techniques.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Users find that Case goes far beyond toolsandM;Keebler Co., an Elmhurst, Ill., cookie maker, needs more than elves to runits information systems operation.andP;  So Jim Ruhland and Jack Merkel looked toa recent computer-aided software engineering (Case) conference in Chicago forsome help.andM;Ruhland and Merkel, senior programmer analysts at Keebler, are carrying whatthey learned at the &quot;Case:  State-of-the-Practice, State-of-the-Art&quot;conference sponsored by Chicago's Extended Intelligence Inc., to an ad hoccommittee formed at Keebler to study software development practices.andM;The group's objective is to determine the feasibility of adopting amethodology for implementing Case.andM;An emphasis on process is important, according to Louisia Taylor, seniorbusiness development consultant for Chicago's Touchstone Systems Group.andO;&quot;It's important to understand that Case is not a technology, it's a systemdevelopment process,&quot; she said.andM;Prior to the conference, the Keebler committee had agreed to first implementa development methodology, and then look for products.andP;  Now, the company islooking to simultaneously implement a methodology and Case tools, Ruhlandsaid.andM;&quot;Most of our people don't realize that the Information Engineeringmethodology takes so long to start up; it's a different way of looking atit,&quot; Ruhland noted.andP;  &quot;We've been trying to just basically take one step at atime.andP;  We're seeing some reasons why that approach might produce failure.andO;That isn't necessarily going to stop us, but we do have to rethink how fastwe're actually going to get into it.&quot;andM;In the total mix of processes loosely gathered under Case, reengineering isthe top need of large corporations, said Carma McClure, vice president ofExtended Intelligence.andP;  &quot;Organizations have to support existing systems whichhave a direct effect on the bottom line,&quot; she said.andM;Even companies that prudently began investing in Case techniques a few yearsago find themselves having to back into old data now, she said.andP;  &quot;A lot ofcompanies are beginning to look at what aspects of Case are valuable to themin the short term, medium term and long term,&quot; said McClure.andM;&quot;The repositories sold by a vendor are empty.andP;  A vendor can supply aninformation model and maybe a process model of the life cycle, but theinformation that describes a system you have to put in yourself.andO;Reengineering tools can help populate a repository,&quot; McClure contended.andM;McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co., St. Louis, is looking to deal with its oldcode by taking advantage of the promises of Case.andM;One conference attendee from McDonnell Douglas (who asked that his name notbe used) said, &quot;As much as I would like to be in the glamor of [applications]development, we're stuck in maintenance.&quot;andM;According to Vaughan Merlyn, a consultant in the Boston office of the NewYork-based Ernst andamp; Young consulting firm, &quot;process&quot; is a key word, and theprimary reason that Case and reengineering remain so hard to cost-justify.andO;&quot;Right now, all the resources are on productivity,&quot; Merlyn said.andM;Product improvements include measurable features such as fewer defects,adaptability and lower costs, Merlyn said.andP;  &quot;Process&quot; concentrates onimproved predictability and reliability with less waste and rework.andM;&quot;The data administrator doesn't contribute to product but to process,&quot; Merlynsaid.andP;  Hence, &quot;the development center idea is facing a significant challengebecause it's about investment in the infrastructure and process.andP;  All peoplewant is to invest in results--everything else is considered overhead.&quot;andM;One solution is to approach information systems as many successful companiesapproach manufacturing processes: subscribing to total quality management(TQM), Merlyn said.andM;&quot;First get your process under control, then figure out why the defecthappened,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Then decide how to change the process.&quot;andM;Before embarking on that remedy, an organization must break the &quot;conflicttriangle&quot; mindset that Merlyn said exists in many IS shops--workers vs.andO;managers vs.andP;  quality control.andM;&quot;Management must provide the leadership,&quot; Merlyn said.andM;Merlyn also pointed out a new IS trend in Case.andM;&quot;Now the resistance is coming from middle management, not top IS management,&quot;he said.andP;  &quot;Top management is committed to and sees a need for change.andP;  Butthey try to pass the commitment down to middle management by sayings thingslike, 'Make the deadline and believe in quality.&quot;andM;The companies that are thriving with Case processes are those that did theirhomework early, said Taylor of Touchstone Systems Group.andM;For example, the First Chicago Financial Corp. and Allstate Insurance Co.,andO;Glenview, Ill., &quot;paid attention to fundamentals.andP;  They correctly addressedinfrastructure issues, the architectures, the organizational structure andtraining and development issues,&quot; she said.andM;Today, many firms are &quot;grappling with the organizational changes that makethis approach to systems development a success,&quot; Taylor said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
