While economic indicators show that consumers have turned more conservative since the start of the year, yesterday's retail reports indicate that consumers are pulling back by shifting their spending to general merchandise from big-ticket items, such as motor vehicles. Sales of new U.S.-built cars have dropped for two consecutive months.    &quot;Automobile sales are weak, as are furniture and appliances,&quot; said Rosalind Wells, J.C. Penney Co. chief economist. &quot;But smaller goods are strong.&quot; New York-based Penney said apparel and soft home furnishings were its fastest-growing lines last month and contributed to a 5.5% rise in February sales for stores open more than one year.    The shift helped retail stores during February, the first month of their fiscal year. Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. said sales for its stores open more than one year rose 5.6%, which is about twice what it had expected, a spokesman said.    Same-store sales for Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp. rose 10.8%, its biggest year-to-year increase since November 1985. Troy, Mich.-based K mart Corp. said its 8.2% rise in same-store sales was also higher than the company expected. Samestore sales for Mobil Corp.'s Montgomery Ward andamp; Co. unit rose 12.7%, its strongest gain in more than two years.    The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., said its same-store sales rose 4.8%. It cited &quot;better than average increases in apparel, home fashions and hardware.&quot; Same-store sales rose 9.4% for St. Louis-based May Department Stores Co. and increased 14% for Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc.    Retailers are usually plagued with weather-related closings during February, but not this year. David Rodenhuis, director of the Climate Analysis Center for the National Weather Service, said some Midwest and North Central states are having the mildest winter in 56 years. The average mean temperature is 13 degrees above normal along the Canadian border, he said.    Some retailers said the warm weather helped business in February. &quot;We were selling more spring and summer-type merchandise,&quot; said Kenneth A. Macke, Dayton Hudson chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;And we didn't miss any sales&quot; from snow storms.    Unusually wet and cold weather dampened retail business in the South. Federated Department Stores Inc.'s Houston-based Foley's unit said the weather and the depressed oil economy of Texas combined to flatten sales. But favorable weather elsewhere helped boost Federated's total store sales 7.3% &quot;It was stormless in most parts of the country,&quot; said Norman S. Matthews, who yesterday was named Federated president and chief operating officer.    February is usually one of the retail industry's least important months, so the strong gains aren't spurring retailers and analysts to increase their projections of moderate sales growth. Jeffrey Feiner, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets analyst, said he continues to see general merchandise sales rising 5.5% to 6% for the first half of the year and 6.5% for the second half.    However, retailers said yesterday that their February sales gains signal strong results for spring even though March sales are expected to dip. &quot;February has given us more confidence about the direction we are going,&quot; said Thomas F. Murasky, K mart vice president, finance. He added that K mart sees &quot;very good&quot; sales gains for the spring.    March sales are widely expected to dip because Easter, which generates most of spring sales, falls three weeks later this year. &quot;Last year most of the Easter business was in March and this year it will be in April,&quot; said Roy Garofalo, vice president of investor relations for New York-based F.W. Woolworth Co., whose 7.1% rise in total domestic sales for February was its biggest gain in a year.    The same-store sales of Chicago-based Carson Pirie Scott andamp; Co. rose 24% in February, in part because the department-store chain began selling spring merchandise about three weeks earlier than last year, said Dennis S. Bookshester, vice chairman. Carson Pirie, like many retailers this spring, is emphasizing more casual wear, such as denim apparel and Hawaiian shirts.    Among other retailers, same-store sales in February rose 28.6% for Rocky Hill, Conn.-based Ames Department Stores Inc. and increased 4.3% for Wilmington, Del.-based Mercantile Stores Co. Same-store sales rose 5% for Minneapolis-based Best Buy Co., increased 6% for Kansas City, Mo.-based Payless Cashways Inc. and advanced 1% for North Wilkesboro, N.C.-based Lowe's Cos.    ---                  Four-week February period                            '87 sales    '86 sales    b-%                             millions     millions   change    Sears .................. $1,645.7     $1,570.5   +  4.8    f-K mart ................$1,401.4     $1,239.3   + 13.1    Wal-Mart ................. $885.0       $615.0   + 44.0    J.C.
