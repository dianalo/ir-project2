Ziff closed with these words: &quot;Under no circumstances wouldI want my daughter to serve in a combat unit.&quot;;    Society has made some giantsteps in liberating the present generation from gender slots. Let us not takea step backward. Although I would not choose a combat role for myself, I willfight for my daughter's right to have it if that is what she wants.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FIGHTING FOR WOMEN'S RIGHT TO BE IN COMBAT  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     -- W.S., Ottawa, Canada; DEAR OTTAWA -- My readers seem to be almostunanimous in their support for your position. Ziff's letter really did stirthem up. Here's more:;    For the record, I am a woman and a former Marineofficer from the Vietnam era. I've seen a lot of military men in my life, fromevery branch of service. If push came to shove, I'd rather it be me bearingarms and making strategic decisions than most of them.;    -- Arcata; I'm ajunior at Hopkins High and I disagree completely with Barry Ziff. He missedthe point that women have been trying to make for years. We want equality. Andthis means all the way. We know that war is hell but why shouldn't women joinmen in that hell if they choose to?;    -- Minnetonka, Minn.;    I would liketo remind Mr. Ziff that the pioneer women in this country were subject totheir own brand of hell as they traveled across this continent. If combat isso terrible, what business have we sending anybody out there to kill and bekilled, male or female?;    -- Citrus Heights;    I am 14 years old (a girl)and I'd like to tell Mr. Ziff that his energies are being misdirected. Heshould use the lessons he learned while fighting for his country to convinceour leaders that we should find another way to solve the world's problems.When people get blown to bits does it matter if they are male or female?;   -- Philadelphia;    The problem with women in combat is not the women, it'sthe men. The majority of men are incapable of fighting alongside a womanbecause they tend to see females as sex objects and/or in need of protection.Most men's libidos and egos are forever getting in the way of keeping theirminds on their jobs.;    -- Greensboro, N.C.;    I'm 39 and the mother of two.I'm considered good-looking and I dress well. Tell Mr. Ziff that I urinate anddefecate wherever I happen to be when I rock climb, backpack or cross-countryski. I have slept in the rain, in the snow and on rock ledges. All this wasvoluntary. So why would I back off if it meant serving my country? Get real,Barry.;    -- Oakland  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ann Landers column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910408  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  13B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  475  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 8, 199100099016,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
