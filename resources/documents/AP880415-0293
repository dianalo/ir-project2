But they also noted that stocks faced some formidable obstaclesin any bid to rebound.   The Labor Department reported Friday morning that the producerprice index of finished goods rose 0.6 percent in March. That putadded emphasis on recent worries about a possible revival ofinflationary pressures.   At the same time, interest rates rose in the credit markets,pushing yields on long-term Treasury bonds close to the 8.95percent level.   Brokers said the bond and stock markets were still feeling theill effects of the unexpected news Thursday that the nation's tradedeficit widened in February.   Gainers among the blue chips that contributed to the Dow Jonesindustrials' gain included International Business Machines, up 2}at 114[, and Texaco, up 1} at 48|.
