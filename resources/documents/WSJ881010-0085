SAGGING HOME sales in the Northeast have some builders and sellers wondering whether prices may have soared too high.    The region's median price of $144,800 (the national median is $91,300) is out of reach for so many consumers that builders are worried about getting stuck with unsold homes.    John Slavin, a builder in Pelham, N.H., recently lowered the price on his most expensive houses to $215,000 from $250,000, hoping to offset a 60% drop in sales so far this year compared with 1987. Still, &quot;we're dead in the water,&quot; he says.    &quot;Prices just cannot continue at these levels,&quot; says Michael Sumichrast, a Washington-based housing economist. &quot;They just went totally crazy, and it's finally catching up -- particularly in New Jersey and New York.&quot;    At a 130-home project in Ewing Township, N.J., developers mired in a backlog of unsold units hired a marketing firm, which recommended that they drop the top price to $137,900 from $179,000 and revise the floor plans.    Another measure of the slowdown is the time a house spends on the for-sale list before it's sold. In Providence, R.I., one of the region's major markets, it now takes about 90 days to sell a house, up from 64 days a year ago, while listings in the greater Providence area have swollen to nearly 5,000 from 3,100.    In Springfield, N.J., Robert and Meredith Francis took their home off the market after three months of failing to get the $289,000 asking price. &quot;We had a lot of people come through,&quot; says Mrs. Francis, &quot;but no one made an offer -- not even a ridiculous offer.&quot;    California Banks Start   Affordable-Homes Fund   IN AN EFFORT to address the shortage of affordable homes, California banks have agreed to form a $100 million revolving pool to provide long-term loans for builders of lower-cost housing in the state, where the median home price is $172,406.    Although specific rules are still being written, bank executives involved in the project -- known as the California Community Reinvestment Corp. -- say they envision it as a ready source of funding at 2 1/2 to three percentage points below prevailing interest rates. In return, developers would agree to give buyers or tenants a break on prices or rents. The builders would make their profit through, say, housing-density concessions granted by cities, which are also encouraging more construction of affordable housing.    &quot;As it stands now, very few banks do this kind of lending,&quot; says John Trauth, executive director of the San Francisco Development Fund. The reason is that, individually, banks have considered this sort of lending risky because the margins are too slim.    Participating institutions, such as Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles, say the new project will also help them satisfy the federal Community Reinvestment Act, which requires financial institutions to invest in the communities where they do business.    Human Variety Appears   In Real-Estate Ads   REAL-ESTATE marketers have discovered that people other than white couples with two kids buy houses.    &quot;In the last six months, there's been a growing recognition in the development community that (minorities) represent a big part of their market,&quot; says Bradley Inman, a housing columnist based in Oakland, Calif.    Print and television ads for homes have lately featured a broad array of buyers. In one series of TV ads, Los Angeles-based Home Savings of America shows black couples and families moving into houses. Print ads for Fox Run Estates in West Charles, Md., portray Asian and black buyers, as well as a single white woman and a single parent with his son. Lomas Mortgage USA Inc., the big Dallas lender, recently ran a series of ads in business publications depicting a single career woman pondering the purchase of a house.    The industry's longstanding practice of using only white families in ad campaigns has come under increasing attack from fair-housing, legal and civil-rights groups. At the Washington Post, real-estate advertisers now have to feature blacks and other minorities in at least one of every four ads they run. A Post spokesman says the policy resulted from heavy criticism of the newspaper two years ago for the absence of black models in such ads.    Urban Homeless Seek   Power Through Unity   IN A GROWING number of cities, homeless people are banding together in associations and task forces, as well as leading demonstrations for relief.    Since 1986, some 24 groups formed by the homeless have sprung up in Washington, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Phoenix, Ariz.    &quot;There is a move afoot among homeless people to organize themselves and to press for their own demands,&quot; says Maria Foscarinis, a lawyer with the National Coalition for the Homeless. Homelessness specialists say the rise in such groups reflects a more diverse homeless population, which is now estimated at three million and growing. Many of those now homeless were recently getting by and know that organizing can pay off.    In Phoenix, a homeless group won library privileges for the homeless after it launched a &quot;Homeless Right to Read&quot; campaign. In Boston, a homeless group was given use of an office in City Hall after it camped out on the building's steps. And San Francisco's Homeless Task Force persuaded the city to extend to a week from three days the amount of time the homeless can stay in emergency housing. </TEXT></DOC>
