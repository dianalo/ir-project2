A CFTC staff report completed in December and released yesterday said Big Board examiners, in monitoring for compliance with commodities rules and regulations, missed some record-keeping violations and failed to report others they did detect. &quot;This matter must be addressed by the NYSE,&quot; the CFTC report said.    The report also said the Big Board's examination program should be revised to give examiners more explicit guidance.    A New York Stock Exchange spokesman called the violations in question &quot;very minor and very isolated.&quot; He added: &quot;Over three years, as in any audit, they'll pick up things that need adjusting.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
