<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-76-1041 </DOCNO><TEXT>A simplified method is presented for estimating onsite turbulence variancewithin the wind turbine layer for horizontal wind speed. The method isbased principally on estimating the probability distribution of windspeed and assigning a variance to each mean wind speed based on surfaceroughness estimates. The model is not proposed as an alternative to onsitemeasurement and analysis, but rather as an adjunct to such a program.A revision of the Kaimal neutral u-component spectrum is suggested toapply to the mix of the stabilities occurring during operational winds.Values of integral length scale calculated from data analysis are shownto contradict the length scale model implicit in turbulence power spectra.Also, these calculated values are shown to be extremely sensitive tothe length of the time series and the detrending method used. 11 refs.,5 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
