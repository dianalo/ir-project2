That notice also proposed to make certain incidentaland conforming amendments to existing regulations regarding post-accident,reasonable cause, and pre-employment drug testing (49 CFR Part 219, SubpartsC, D, and F).On May 24, 1988, FRA published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> an announcement of public hearings on the NPRM(54 FR 18589). Hearings were held in Chicago, Illinois, on June 14, 1988,in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 15, 1988, in Los Angeles, California, on June23, 1988, and in Washington, DC, on June 28 and 29, 1988. The docket remainedopen for public comments through August 8, 1988. In keeping with FRA'sannounced policy to consider late-filed comments to the extent practicable,FRA has considered all comments submitted through August 22, 1988.On July 28, 1988, FRA published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> an Interim Rule and Interim Statements of Policy(53 FR 28594) implementing Pub. L. 100-342, the Rail Safety ImprovementAct of 1988. This document amended the responsibility for compliance sectionof the present regulations (49 CFR 219.9) by making applicable to individualsthe civil penalty sanctions of section 209 of the Federal Railroad SafetyAct of 1970, as amended.Industry and Regulatory BackgroundFRA has previously described at great length the historic efforts of therailroad industry to deal with safety hazards caused by alcohol and drugsand the very severe consequences to public and employee safety when thoseefforts have not been successful. (See documents pertinent to promulgationof the existing regulations at 48 FR 30723, July 5, 1983 (ANPRM); 49 FR24252, June 12, 1984 (NPRM); 50 FR 31508, August 2, 1985 (Final Rule)).The existing regulations regarding control of alcohol and drug use in railroadoperations became effective beginning on February 10, 1986. Those regulations(49 CFR Part 219), which apply to employees performing functions subjectto the Hours of Service Act (45 U.S.C. 61 et seq.)_<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T2>f</T2> Prohibit any employee from going or remaining on duty whileusing, possessing or being under the influence of alcohol or a controlledsubstance;<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T2>f</T2> Mandate post-accident toxicological testing following certainsignificant train accidents and employee fatalities;<ITAG tagnum="16"/><T2>f</T2> Require improved reporting of alcohol/drug involvement in accident/incidents(49 CFR 225.17(d));andbullet; Provide for pre-employment drug screens;andbullet; Authorize testing for reasonable cause (i.e., on reasonable suspicion,after an accident or injury involving human failure, or following an enumeratedsafety rule violation); andandbullet; Require railroads to implement policies designed to identify employeestroubled by substance abuse problems through voluntary referrals and co-workerreporting.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Over three years after issuance, elements of the rule remain underchallenge in litigation now pending before the United States Supreme Court(<T3>Burnley v. Railway Labor Executives' Association,</T3> No. 87-1555).This regulatory program builds on an extensive history on the part of therail unions, the railroads and FRA in development of employee assistanceprograms and encouragement of education and awareness activities. Railunions have included sobriety and mutual assistance in their organizationalobjectives since their formation in the last century. The railroads have,since their inception, enforced Rule G, the standard operating rule forbiddingemployees to go or remain on duty while using, possessing or being underthe influence of alcohol. In recent years, mind-altering drugs have beenadded to this prohibition. Beginning in the 1950's, and on a broad frontduring the 1970's, the railroads developed and put in place some of thebest employee assistance programs in all of American industry, servingextremely large client loads, and often including family members of employees.Employee assistance services have been made available to employees dischargedfor alcohol and drug-related violations, and voluntary referrals on a confidentialbasis have been actively encouraged.Concurrent with the development and implementation of the existing regulatoryprogram, FRA has actively promoted the design and implementation of peerprevention programs led by employees and supported by rail management.These efforts, known within the industry as Operation Red Block or OperationStop (hereafter collectively ``Operation Red Block''), provide a meansfor rank-and-file workers to protect their own safety while assisting fellowemployees with substance abuse problems through education, awareness campaigns,intervention and, if necessary, confrontation of workers who come to workimpaired. In exchange for this active employee involvement, railroad managementson a number of properties have agreed to withhold discipline in first-offensecases under the companies' substance abuse policy or Rule G (the standardoperating rule prohibiting alcohol and drug use, possession and impairment),even when the offense is detected through incident-driven alcohol/drugtesting and/or observations of railroad supervisors. In the next month,FRA will release a case study detailing the functioning of Operation RedBlock on two railroads.In addition to regulatory and voluntary activities, the railroad companiesthemselves have taken a variety of initiatives to address substance abuseamong their employees. For instance, of the seven large rail systems thatprovide roughly 85 percent of rail transportation services in the UnitedStates (Burlington Northern, Conrail, CSX Rail Transportation, NorfolkSouthern, Santa Fe, Southern Pacific and Union Pacific) (hereinafter ``majorrail systems'') five have implemented drug screens in connection with physicalexaminations as a part of their medical qualifications programs. Theseexaminations are typically conducted on a periodic basis and when employeesreturn to service or transfer from one type of job position to another.Most of these programs have been challenged in litigation under the RailwayLabor Act, even though it is the uniform practice of the railroads to usethe results of drug screens for medical qualifications purposes and toreturn the employee to service upon presentation of a negative specimen(and completion of any substance abuse treatment that the employee, orthe medical officer, deem necessary). See <T3>Railway Labor Executives Association Consolidated Rail Corporation,</T3>845 F.2d 1187 (3rd Cir. 1988) (barring medical testing), cert. granted<T2>X</T2> U.S. <T2>X</T2>; <T3>Railway Labor Executives Association v. Norfolk and Western Ry.,</T3>833 F.2d 700 (7th Cir. 1987) (medical testing creates only minor disputesubject to arbitration); <T3>Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, Lodge 16 v. BurlingtonNorthern Railroad Company,</T3> 802 F.2d 1016 (8th Cir. 1986) (post-furloughtesting held minor dispute).All of the major rail systems have in place some form of training programfor supervisors in drug abuse detection, and some of the programs providefor inclusion of employees and their representatives. Union organizationshave also included substance abuse prevention information in their meetingsand widely disseminated publications, and thousands of prevention committeemembers have received training through their railroads.During the past three years, several thousand managers, supervisors andemployee representatives have participated in conferences sponsored (orjointly sponsored) by FRA to provide information concerning FRA's regulatoryprogram or to promote Operation Red Block. The most recent of these meetings,a working conference to share the field experience of the Operation RedBlock prevention teams and expose nonparticipants to program concepts,was held in Fort Worth, Texas, in May of this year. At this conferencethe Federal Railroad Administrator once again strongly urged nonparticipatingrailroads and unions to join together in supporting Operation Red Block,and some additional Operation Red Block agreements have been signed sincethat time.In short, the railroad industry approaches the 1990's having attemptedevery major strategy conceivable to control alcohol and drug use, withthe exception of random testing. Despite these efforts and the progressthey have brought, however, the public and railroad employees remain atrisk.<ITAG tagnum="84">Drug Abuse Prevalence</ITAG>Tools of MeasurementDrug abuse prevalence is a changing reality that responds to many variables,including temporary or permanent effects of countermeasures implementedby employers or the government. The prevalence of drug abuse in any populationis also difficult to measure directly due to a variety of reasons, includingthe following:andbullet; Survey techniques using self and peer reporting are not necessarilywell suited to determination of conduct that involves illegal acts. (FRAattempted to obtain reliable survey data on drug abuse in one railroadregion, following the general model used for the 1978 alcohol survey conductedunder the Railroad Employee Assistance Project. This effort was not successful,since drug users would not report their own use and co-workers often saidthere was a problem in the workplace while denying having seen incidentsof drug use (which they would have been responsible for reporting had theybeen witnesses.))andbullet; Supervisor/management estimates of drug abuse undertaken priorto institution of testing programs consistently understate prevalence ratesas measured by other, more objective means.andbullet; Testing programs relying on body fluids reflect only immediatepast use (within the period necessary to reduce the concentration of drugor metabolite below the cut-off for the test) and thus understate the percentof population who may use drugs within a longer time period, such as aweek, month or a year.andbullet; For-cause testing programs generally produce positive rates higherthan random or periodic testing, since drug abusers are overrepresentedin events giving rise to the tests by virtue of their more frequent contributionto their occurrence.andbullet; Reasonable suspicion testing, which is often aggregated with for-causetesting for reporting purposes, obviously produces high rates of detectionbecause the individuals are selected based on signs and symptoms consistentwith drug use.andbullet; Scheduled testing with advance notice (e.g., periodic physical)produces positive rates much lower than actual incidence in the population,since all nondependent users and even some dependent users can abstainfor the period necessary to avoid detection. Such testing of employed populationsalso results in apparent precipitous declines in prevalence as measuredthrough the testing process. These declines may be partially illusory,since they may reflect increased effort by drug abusers to avoid detectionby abstaining prior to the tests.andbullet; Testing programs may not be directly comparable for a varietyof reasons, including scope of substances tested, cut-offs on screeningand confirmation, rigor with which collection is supervised, laboratorydiligence in identifying diluted and adulterated samples, and varying ratesof refusal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Prevalence may also vary as the population changes through turnover(entry and exit) and passage of time (as some persons put aside habitslearned in their youths and others develop habits, e.g., as a result oflife crises or exposure to addicting substances in the course of medicaltreatment).Individual Railroad Data and Industry EstimatesIn the course of this rulemaking and program administration FRA has gathereda variety of statistical indicators from the railroads that verify thepresence of a substance abuse problem in the industry and permit inferencesto be drawn with respect to its size and significance.A major western rail system employing 27,000 employees reports having performedover 23,000 urinalysis tests for alcohol and drugs of abuse since 1985,some 5,000 of which were for cause, with the remainder conducted in themedical program. In 1985, medical testing yielded a positive rate of 13.7percent, but this indicator had dropped to 2.3 percent during the firstfour months of 1988. For-cause testing (including of FRA post-accident)yielded 24.1 percent positives in 1985, but had declined to 8.3 percentin 1988. This railroad's statistics for non-Hours of Service employeesshowed similar or slightly higher rates of detection for those groups despitebroad corporate policies reaching all crafts.Another major western railroad has pursued what it characterizes as a veryaggressive for-cause testing program since August of 1984. From an initialpositive rate in excess of 20 percent, the railroad reported an incidencerate of about 2 percent in early 1988. Transportation department employeeson this railroad tested positive at a 5.6 percent rate in 1987. Maintenance-of-wayand maintenance-of-equipment personnel tested positive at a similar orslightly lower rate. However, applicants for maintenance-of-way employmenttested positive at a 38.6 percent rate as late as 1986 (the last year forwhich data was provided).A major eastern rail system experiences positive rates during periodicphysical examinations of under 1 percent. The railroad's reasonable causepositive rate was 4 percent in 1987, but dropped to 2 percent in the first5 months of 1988. Return-from-furlough testing, which tends to focus onyounger employees, yielded an 8.4 percent positive rate in 1987 but only3.2 percent in 1988 (6 months).Another major western rail system that performs most of its testing inthe medical context, but also requires reasonable cause testing, experiencedan overall 2.8 percent positive rate in 1987, falling to 1.6 percent inthe first 5 months of 1988. This railroad's reasonable cause statisticsreported under 49 CFR Part 217 showed a considerably higher positive ratefor drugs in for-cause testing (15 percent), but with very few tests conducted(27), some of which may have been reasonable suspicion tests.The major rail system on which Operation Red Block had its genesis reportsthe following alcohol/drug positive rates for mandatory post-accident andFRA reasonable cause testing: 8.3 percent in 1986, 10.6 percent in 1987,and 9.7 percent in 1988.A northeastern commuter authority reports an overall positive rate of 11.4percent for alcohol and drugs in for-cause, mandatory post-accident, andreturn-to-work testing since 1985.A large midwest regional railroad has been administering mandatory post-accidentand reasonable cause tests to its employees since 1986. In the first sixmonths of that year, the railroad experienced a 13 percent positive rate(combined for both types of testing), declining to 5.3 percent in the mostrecent six-month period.Railroads view alcohol and drug use as a unitary problem and so generallydid not break down the two categories in presenting information in thisrulemaking, so certain of the data presented above included both alcoholand drugs (where urine testing programs included alcohol). FRA has notedin the past, and through review of for-cause data submitted under 49 CFRPart 217, that the ratio of drug to alcohol positives in urine testingprograms is typically about four or five to one.As reflected by testimony in this proceeding, national and system unionleaders generally estimate that use of drugs or alcohol affecting performanceis a problem for approximately ten percent, or just under ten percent,of railroad employees.National Railroad Prevalence DataFRA administers two systems that collect prevalence data for the railroadindustry. The first is a system of annual reporting regarding reasonablecause tests and Rule G dispositions (49 CFR 217.13(d)). In 1986, 5.8 percentof 2,953 reasonable cause urine tests were positive for alcohol or otherdrugs, with the rate for drugs other than alcohol running at 4.4% percent.In 1987, 6.8% of 5,439 reasonable cause urine tests were positive for alcoholor drugs, and the rate for drugs other than alcohol was 5.5% percent. Inboth years, marijuana and illegal stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines) dominatedthe ``other drug'' category, but central nervous system depressants (barbiturates,benzodiazepines) and narcotics (morphine and codeine) were well represented.FRA also centrally administers a program for analysis of blood and urinespecimens collected at independent medical facilities following significantrailroad accidents. The categories of events are defined in such a waythat roughly two-thirds of the testing events will be caused by human factors.(The remainder are selected solely based on severity and the public needto investigate causation and may, after investigation, be determined tohave been caused exclusively by track, equipment or other factors.) Althoughthe purposes of this program focus on investigation of individual accidentsand targeting of resources for remediation, data are also aggregated toreflect incidence rates among the population tested. Pertinent informationfrom this program is displayed below:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1>  </H1><H1>2/10/86-12/31/86 </H1><H1>1987 (12 mos.) </H1><H1>1/1/88-6/30/88</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Qualifying events <D>170 </D><D>179 </D><D>85</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Employees sampled <D>738 </D><D>770 </D><D>336</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Positive for alcohol (percent) <D>.9 </D><D>.4 </D><D>1.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Positive for controlled substance (unauthorized use) (percent) <D>3.7 </D><D>5.1 </D><D>6.5</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Of particular concern is the fact that 14.9 percent of commuter railroademployees tested after qualifying accidents in the past two and one-halfyears were positive for unauthorized use of controlled substances.</ITAG>SignificanceFRA remains concerned that aggregate reasonable cause and post-accidentstatistics remain at relatively high levels, notwithstanding material changesin certain indicators on individual railroads. The aggregate reasonablecause statistics likely reflect the commencement in 1987 of reasonablecause programs on many railroads that previously had not adopted aggressivetesting strategies. As noted above, railroads that maintain testing programsat reasonable levels of effort do show significant declines in positiverates, even for short-notice testing. FRA would therefore expect the long-termtrend to show declines in positive rates on a national basis.However, the rate of positive test results in postaccident testing, anappreciable portion of which involve recent or very heavy use (based onreview of blood and urine levels), continues to be alarming. Although thedetection of drug use among employees involved in an accident does notinvariably mean that accident was caused by drugs, it does indicate thepresence of a risk factor. And the nation's railroads continue to experienceaccidents for which strong indications point to alcohol or drug use asa casual or contributing factor.Accident HistoryWhen FRA published the current regulations, we stated as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">If we have not yet experienced a serious passenger train accidentfor which alcohol or drug involvement has been documented, it must neverthelessbe remembered that the potential exists.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(50 FR 31508, 31525; August 2, 1985). Despite all efforts to preventthis type of event from occurring, 16 persons were killed and 174 wereinjured when a Conrail movement passed an absolute restrictive signal andwent through a switch into the path of a high-speed Amtrak train at Chase,Maryland, on January 4, 1987. The engineer and conductor of the Conrailengines later admitted smoking marijuana in the cab just prior to the collision.Aggregation of all costs from this accident, including property damageand settlement of wrongful death and personal injury claims, may approach$100 million. With every hope that history will not repeat itself, we noteagain today that for so long as a significant number of railroad employeescontinue their misuse of alcohol and drugs the railroads, railroad employeesand the public remain exposed to an unacceptable risk. This risk includesdanger to passenger operations, the possibility of release of toxic orvolatile hazardous materials, and the ever-present exposure of crewmembersfrom collisions and high-speed derailments.The experience of 1987, which began so tragically with the Chase, Maryland,accident, is illustrative of the human and material consequences that drugand alcohol abuse can cause. According to a Safety Study by the NationalTransportation Safety Board entitled ``Alcohol/Drug Use and its Impacton Railroad Safety'' (NTSB/SS-88/04; June 1, 1988) (hereafter NTSB Alcohol/DrugStudy), the Board found alcohol or drug involvement was a probable causeof eight rail transportation accidents in 1987, including one rail transitaccident. The Board said that alcohol/drug involvement was listed as acontributing factor in the case of two additional accidents, one of thema transit accident. The 1987 railroad accidents listed in the NTSB studyincluded, in addition to the Chase, Maryland, accident_andbullet; New York, New York, April 10: Employee fatality during switchingmovement; deceased tested positive for marijuana metabolite and conductordirecting movement trested positive for cocaine metabolite.andbullet; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, April 11: Sideswipe/derailment of freighttrain overspeed on curve; 22,000 residents evacuated due to hazardous materialrelease; engineer at fault tested positive for non-authorized use of butalbital,a barbiturate widely available in prescription medications.andbullet; New York, New York, April 27: Rear end collision of commuter trainsdue to motorman failing to observe signal; 17 injured; motorman testedpositive for marijuana.andbullet; North Platte, Nebraska, September 19: Hostler left locomotivesunattended without brakes, causing them to run into standing train; damage$271,000; hostler positive for marijuana.andbullet; Kemmerer, Wyoming, November 8: Head-on collision of freight trainsresulting in fatality, 8 injuries and $900,000 in damage; front brakemanof train not operated in accordance with signal indications positive forcocaine.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Including the above-listed, FRA has identified 13 accidents during1987 involving alcohol or drug positives where employees may have beenimpaired and contributed to the cause or severity of those accidents.FRA continues to detect at least one positive for alcohol or drugs in anaverage of one out of five accidents for which testing is conducted. For1988, several accidents still under investigation or review illustratethe potential impacts of impaired employees:andbullet; Chester, Pennsylvania, January 29: High-speed passenger trainrouted onto track occupied by maintenance-of-way equipment, 19 injured;$3,380,000 in property damage; block operator fled post after accident,but his urine specimen collected three and one-half days later tested positivefor marijuana metabolite, and traces of the cocaine metabolite and amphetamines.andbullet; Dixon, Illinois, March 21: Freight trains collided head-on; 3injuries; $195,000 in damage; dispatcher positive for alcohol (.15 percent)and one brakeman on each train tested positive for marijuana.andbullet; Mount Vernon, New York, April 6: Rear-end collision of empty commutertrains; 1 fatality; damage $1 million; engineer of striking train positivefor marijuana metabolite (trace); dispatcher positive for opiates; blockoperator and assistant block operator positive for butalbital; levermanpositive for marijuana.andbullet; Fairlawn, New Jersey, May 21: Head-on collision of freight trains;1 fatality; damage $39,000; dispatcher positive for marijuana.andbullet; Long Beach, California, June 9: Switching collision of freighttrains; 4 injuries; $51,000 damage; conductor of crew under investigationwas positive for marijuana.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Overall, in the period January 1, 1987, through August 15, 1988, therehave been 54 qualifying accidents in which one or more employees testedpositive for unauthorized use of controlled substances. Thirty-two peopledied in those accidents, 357 were injured, and more than $33 million inrailroad property was destroyed.In summary, FRA remains concerned that all of the necessary and quite usefulmeasures implemented to date have not been sufficient to bring an end tothe threat to rail safety posed by misuse of alcohol and drugs.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Rule</ITAG>The NPRM proposed to prohibit use by safety-sensitive railroad employeesof a controlled substance at any time, except with medical authorization,and to require implementation of random drug testing programs for thoseemployees. The preamble and proposed rule text set out a number of issuesto be resolved with respect to the design and implementation of these provisionsand options for disposition of employees testing positive. The NPRM alsoproposed to amend the penalty schedule to Part 219 and make amendmentsto Part 217 to collect adequate data on the random testing program.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments and Conclusions</ITAG>General Overview of the Major IssuesIn response to the NPRM, the FRA received comments from seventy-six persons,including written submissions and oral testimony at five public hearings.June hearings were held in Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Washingtonand all written comments received by August 22, 1988 were considered. Commentswere received from thirty-six railroads, two organizations representingrailroads, ten employee organizations, thirteen individuals, nine personsor organizations with some expertise in analysis of urine for drugs ofabuse, and six public interest organizations.All commenters supported the goal of a drug-free railroad operating enviornment.In general terms, the use of random testing as a means of achieving thisgoal received broad support from rail operators and members of the drugand alcohol testing industry. Labor organizations, however, opposed theimposition of mandatory random drug testing.<T3>Evidence of a problem</T3>. Railroads noted that present testing programsreveal current drug use by employees (see discussion of data culled fromrailroad drug testing experience to date, above). All Class I carriersexpressed concern at the level of drug usage being detected, stating thatsuch usage has a detrimental effect on the safety of operations. A numberof commenters, including Safe Travel America, pointed to the Chase, Marylandaccident as evidence of the grave consequences of drug use.<T3>Support for random testing.</T3> Rail carriers were joined in theirsupport of random testing by a number of public interest groups, individuals,and members of the drug testing industry. These commenters are alarmedby the evidence of drug use among railroad employees and they believe thata random drug testing program is necessary to confront the problem. Theybelieve that random testing is the most effective deterrent to drug useavailable. During oral testimony it was frequently stated that the interestsof public safety justify the slight intrusion upon employee privacy.<T3>Random testing as a deterrent</T3>. FRA heard from several railroadsand experts who believe that random testing is justified because it providesa deterrent to on-duty and off-duty drug use. Commenters were nearly unanimousin their appraisal of the deterrent effect of random testing. Peter Bensingerof Bensinger, DuPont and Associates stated that, based upon his own considerableexperience in the field, he believes that random testing is the most effectivedeterrent yet devised. Only the RLEA doubted the power of random testing'sdeterrent effect, stating that employee fear of discipline for a rule violationpresents a deterrent of at least equal weight.<T3>Opposition to random testing</T3>. Random testing was opposed by laborgroups, CSX Transportation, eight inidividuals, and the Epilepsy Foundationof America. These commenters believe that random testing is an unacceptablyintrusive and unnecessary method of curbing drug use by railroad employees.Random testing was opposed on constitutional grounds, and a number of alternativeswere suggested. Many feared that railroads would use this new form of testingto harass union locals and employees. Others object to what they perceiveto be an underlying bias_that an employee is guilty of misconduct untilhe can prove his innocence. The Railway Labor Executives Association (RLEA)contended that random testing would encourage drug users to switch to moredangerous drugs for which testing is not conducted.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) believed that other measuresshould be implemented before it is decided that random testing should beimplemented. (See discussion below.)<T3>Alternative Strategies</T3>. Labor, CSX Transportation, and the NTSBalso believe that the implementation of testing is unnecessary and mayundermine other efforts at controlling drug use. Several alternatives weresuggested:1. FRA should encourage carriers to establish Operation Red Block programs.These programs are supported because they instill trust between managementand employees while being more effective in removing impaired employeesfrom service. CSX Transportation submitted information which was said toindicate that their own Red Block program has helped to improve their safetyrecord and to drastically reduce instances of Rule G violations.2. FRA should only mandate that carriers develop their own testing programsthrough collective bargaining with unions. This was opposed by testingproponents because it would delay the imposition of testing and possiblyrequire employers to administer numerous different programs for the variouscrafts. Safe Travel America disfavored this approach because it would preventpublic input into the process. Some commenters also believed that a uniformnationwide program is superior to a piecemeal approach.3. FRA should encourage training of supervisors in the detection of troubledemployees.4. FRA should do more to promote safety equipment such as automatic traincontrol devices.5. FRA should regulate carrier practices which create an environment conduciveto drug and alcohol abuse. Among the factors thought to encourage abuseare long hours, long layovers and overnight stays at away from home terminals.Labor unions and the NTSB stated that these efforts coupled with existingprograms (post-accident testing, reasonable cause testing, pre-employmenttesting, medical testing, Rule G and employee assistance programs (EAP's))should provide the necessary remedy for employee drug use. (NTSB's commentsare more fully discussed below.)CSX proposed that FRA support these programs and help establish acceptablelevels of positive test results for the various non-selective testing methods.CSX suggested that random testing be mandated only for those carriers orregions that fail to meet the established target rate.Constitutional Issues Regarding Random Drug Testing<T3>Comments</T3>: The FRA received few detailed comments on the constitutionalityof the proposed rule. A number of railroads, individuals and public interestgroups indicated that they believe the FRA proposal to be constitutionalbecause the public right to safety overrides an employee's less significantclaim to privacy. Labor groups, CSX Transportation, and the Epilepsy Foundationof America, however, either questioned or affirmatively challenged theconstitutionality of the rule.A commenter also submitted the views of Senator Daniel Inouye (preparedfor a legislative committee report), who viewed random testing of transportationemployees as constitutionally defective by virtue of its impact on allemployees, including the majority who do not misuse drugs. <T3>See </T3>Senate Rept. 100-43 at 39-42 (additional views on S. 1041).<T3>Conclusions</T3>: Commenters in this rulemaking have not contendedthat a drug-free policy such as contained in section 219.102 of the proposedrule infringes protected constitutional interests, and we believe it isclear that it would not. <T3>See New York Transit Authority v. Beazer</T3>, 440 U.S. 568 (1979).FRA is keenly aware of the constitutional issues posed by random drug testing.Those issues, and logically antecedent issues, are being litigated in avariety of forums already, and will likely be substantially resolved bythe Supreme Court in pending litigation and cases already in the courtsof appeals before the instant rule could wind its way through the judicialprocess. The Federal Aviation Administration addresses the constitutionalissues in its preamble elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>. A very similar analysis applies to the issuesin the instant rule applicable to railroad employees.FRA has endeavored to craft the final rule in a manner ensuring that randomtesting programs meet objective criteria that protect against any exerciseof discretion by the railroad in selecting a particular employee for testing.Urine collections will occur in private, except where carefully delineatedconditions provide reason to believe that the employee may alter or substitutethe specimen. The final rule carefully protects medical information necessarilydeveloped incident to the testing process (i.e., provided by the employeeat the time of sample collection or revealed through testing for controlledsubstances that have therapeutic uses). Confidentiality protections fortest results involving even illicit drug use will limit the perceived intrusivenessof the program from the point of view of the abuser, and non-abusers willobviously have nothing to fear. The final rule also affirms due processrights through careful control of the testing process itself, includingreview of test results by an expert fact-finder (the medical review officer),opportunity for the employee to make further explanations prior to anyaction on a laboratory report, access to underlying records and right tohave the sample analyzed by another certified laboratory. Existing proceduralrights with respect to employment remain unabridged (e.g., investigation,grievance and adjustment under the collective bargaining agreement andsection 3 of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. 153).FRA has, in short, adopted the full range of protections useful to ensurefairness and confidentiality and to check abuse of discretion. The sanctionsagainst individuals now available under amendments made by the Rail SafetyImprovement Act of 1988 will further strengthen FRA's ability to enforcethese important protections. Further, FRA is making the enhanced testingsafeguards applicable to our existing rule.Extent of the Drug Problem in Rail Transportation<T3>Comments: </T3>Comments regarding the prevalence of the drug problemin rail transportation are discussed above. Virtually all commenters agreedthat drug use remains at unacceptable levels and that it poses a safetyrisk that must be addressed. Commenters differed in the means deemed appropriateto address the problem.<T3>Conclusions</T3>: Like the commenters, FRA remains concerned that misuseof controlled substances by railroad employees engaged in safety-sensitiveduties is a significant problem that threatens the safety of railroad employeesand the public for so long as it continues.Accuracy of Drug Test Results<T3>Comments</T3>: The FRA received comments from labor groups and individualsquestioning the accuracy of drug testing. Experts testified, however, thatuse of GS/MS by the Coast Guard and U.S. Navy has turned up no false positivesafter thousands of proficiency tests. PharmChem, Inc. related that theirown experience has shown that with proper confirmation techniques, drugtesting is essentially errorless if chain of custody is properly maintained.<T3>Conclusions: </T3>The accuracy of properly administered urine testingfor drugs of abuse is not a matter of speculation. The scientific toolsare available to make positive identification of specific compounds inhuman body fluids. <T3>See, </T3>e.g., <T3>Urine Testing for Drugs of Abuse, </T3>Research Monograph Series No.73 (National Institute on Drug Abuse 1986); <T3>GC/MS Assays for Abused Drugs in Body Fluids, </T3>Research MonographSeries No. 32 (National Institute on Drug Abuse 1980). Commercial testinglaboratories have extensive experience in the use of relevant technologies.The College of American Pathologists has for many years administered anopen proficiency testing program for clinical laboratories performing drugtesting. The United States armed services have conclusively demonstratedthe value of blind proficiency testing as a means of ensuring reliableidentification of positive specimens and documentation that no false positivetests are being reported, and two major railroads are already utilizingthis technique. Finally, the Department of Health and Human Services isnow administering a laboratory certification program that will identifya number of major laboratories capable of providing first-rate forensiccontrol and documentation of testing, as well as first-rate analyticaltoxicology. Certification of additional laboratories is expected in thenext few weeks, as the carefully-planned process of initial proficiencytesting and laboratory inspection is completed. As adapted for private sector application, the HHS Guidelines provide aworkable and forensically sound approach to determination of the presenceof drugs and their metabolites in urine. Care must be taken, of course,to prevent, detect and correct any error in application of the safeguardsprovided by the Guidelines and sound laboratory practice. FRA believessuch errors, if any, will be extremely rare and readily susceptible tocorrection. Coverage of Employees <T3>Comments: </T3>Four railroads and one substance abuse expert testifiedin support of the current provision mandating testing only for employeescovered by the Hours of Service Act. But a majority of commenters favoredextending the degree of coverage to some extent. Labor, several railroads,and the NTSB all favored testing of first line supervisors. Testing ofthese individuals was supported because they make frequent safety criticaldecisions and because the testing of managers promotes employee faith inthe fairness of the program. There was also broad support, especially among carriers, for extendingtesting to maintenance of way employees. It was stated that these employeesoperate machinery over tracks while normal operations are in progress.They therefore pose as much of a threat to safety as employees who arecovered by the Hours of Service Act. To a lesser extent, extension of coverage to the following groups was supported:car inspectors, shop mechanics, railroad officers who carry firearms, andclerks who prepare paperwork for the transportation of hazardous materials.<T3>Conclusions: </T3>FRA is persuaded that regulations for the controlof alcohol and drug use should, from the point of view of ideal or optimumsafety objectives, extend to all employees engaged in functions bearingdirectly on the safety of rail operations. Railroad policies generallyreflect this point of view, as well. Given this objective, a Federal rulewould extend to those actually involved in moving freight and passengers,those responsible for inspection or maintenance of rail track and structures,employees who work on rolling stock or inspect it for compliance with Federalstandards, those who prepare shipping papers for hazardous materials, on-boardservice personnel on passenger trains, and a variety of other employeeswho are few in number but whose responsibilities can affect safety. Nevertheless, to date FRA has limited the coverage of its regulations toemployees directly involved in moving passengers and freight and maintainingsignal systems that govern train operations, i.e., employees covered bythe Hours of Service Act. FRA has maintained this distinction for a varietyof reasons, including the frequency with which these employees performsafety-sensitive tasks, the devastation that they can produce by act oromission, and the demonstrable impacts that occur when any single employeeis impaired by alcohol or drugs. Congressional attention to these functionsthrough the Hours of Service Act has also established a strong precedentfor focusing the alcohol/drug control program on persons performing thesefunctions. Further, FRA has sought to focus its enforcement efforts onareas of most immediate need. There is a growing body of opinion within the railroad industry, as expressedin the comments submitted in response to the NPRM, the additional employees,salaried and wage-earning, should be included within the coverage of measuressuch as the drug-free rule and random drug testing. FRA agrees that broadercoverage may be warranted, based on known safety exposure and prevalenceof drug use among other railroad employees. However, FRA is not willingto effectively delegate the task of defining the classes of employees coveredby use of a vague definitional formula; nor can FRA overlook the issuesof degree that are particularly critical when one is considering a randomtesting proposal. Further, FRA is cognizant of the burdens imposed on employeesand railroads by any random testing program and seeks to limit those burdensto the extent possible consistent with safety. FRA believes that the appropriate approach to this issue is to put in placethe remaining elements necessary to comprise a comprehensive alcohol/drugregulatory program for employees performing functions subject to the Hoursof Service Act. Both this rulemaking and successful completion of pendinglitigation will be necessary to achieve this objective. The issue of broadercoverage can then be considered at an appropriate later date with respectto all or a portion of the elements of the comprehensive basic program.Drug-Free Rule <T3>Comments: </T3>The great majority of commenters support FRA effortsto prohibit off-duty as well as on-duty use. These commenters offered severalcompelling reasons for proscribing off-duty use. Most significantly, anumber of experts and railroads pointed to the recent scientific studieswhich indicate that off-duty use has a lingering effect and can cause impairmenteven while the user is not subject to noticeable acute effects. It is arguedthat this compromise of fitness is not permissible in an employee who performssafety critical functions. Commenters offered several other reasons for a drug-free rule. Any employeefound to have drugs in his system is more likely to use drugs on-duty.Two commenters also noted that drug use is infectious_a casual off-dutyuser may be reluctant to turn in a fellow employee who is impaired on thejob. An employee who uses drugs off-duty may be distracted while on thejob by concerns over how he will obtain and pay for his next supply. Onecarrier expressed its view that a person willing to break laws (as evidenceby illicit drug use) should not be entrusted with the responsibilitiesof a safety sensitive position. A few commenters contended that testingfor off-duty use is necessary because present testing techniques can onlydetermine the presence of drugs, and not whether the subject is impaired.Only a few commenters objected to use of testing technologies that necessarilydiscover off-duty use. The RLEA based its objection on the contention thatpresent studies are inconclusive as to the lingering effects of drug use.The RLEA argued that an intrusion upon employee privacy should not be basedupon an unproven premise. Dr. John P. Morgan and Dr. Arthur J. McBay alsoquestion the reliability of studies tending to indicate that drug use canhave lingering effects. Dr. McBay takes the position, in effect, that thesafety risk associated with marijuana use is not documented, particularlyafter the acute effects of the drug are no longer apparent to the user,and that FRA overestimated drug abuse prevalence in rail transportation.(Dr. McBay further took a skeptical approach to virtually every additionalmajor tenet of the rulemaking, even going so far as to question whethermarijuana use is a public health program. (Cf., e.g., Institute of Medicine,<T3>Marijuana and Health </T3>(National Academy Press 1982).) <T3>Conclusions: </T3>The fundamental premise of this rulemaking is thatpublic and employee safety can be adequately protected only if employeesengaged in safety-sensitive functions are free from the effects of drugsused without proper medical supervision. As described in the NPRM, theeffects of drugs may include after-effects, chronic effects and withdrawaleffects, as well as acute drug intoxication. The great weight of the commentsin response to the NPRM supported FRA's judgment that it is not reasonableto allow the public to remain at risk from the consequences of drug abuseby attempting to address the problem only when overt manifestations presentthemselves in an unambiguous manner in the workplace. Certain of the labor organizations continue to refer to the employee'sright to do what he pleases ``on his own time.'' However, employee representativesexpressed differing viewpoints on this issue during the rulemaking. Employees,like transportation companies and government regulators, are graduallycoming to the realization that society pays a substantial price for unauthorizeduse of controlled substances and that it is not possible to convenientlyseparate drug abuse off duty from fitness on duty. This realization isdramatically evidenced by the CSX Rail agreements for reasonable cause(post-accident or casualty) and return-to-service drug urine testing. Theagreements implicitly recognize that any employee bringing residues ofdrug use to a fitness-for-duty examination is a matter of legitimate safetyconcern, whether or not on-duty use or impairment can be demonstrated.The consequences of detection in this context is removal from service untilsuccessful completion of rehabilitation, and it is a consequence fullyendorsed by the labor organizations in a collectively bargained agreement.A similar recognition is embodied in the recent agreement between the Brotherhoodof Railroad Signalmen and the Southeastern Pennsylvania TransportationAuthority. In the final analysis FRA's judgment that safety-sensitive employees shouldbe free of drugs and their lingering effects is not one based on a handfulof scientific studies or opinions of individual experts. Scientific studiescan be cited for virtually any proposition, and there are as many opinionson issues of this breadth as there are experts. FRA's judgment is informedby the collective experience of the railroad industry, drug abuse clinicians,and those who have participated in this and prior rulemakings on controlof alcohol and drug use. It is not possible to detail the full extent ofthat experience in any reasonable number of pages, but the following considerationsare illustrative: 1. FRA has noted the prominence of cocaine abusers in serious accidentswhere evidence of heavy use was present, but recency of use was in question.FRA has also noted the clinical data associated with cocaine use that indicatesa variety of adverse after-effects which could negatively impact employeefitness. 2. Misuse of controlled substances may be of concern even where promptedby the most innocent of motivations, such as self-medication for an illness.The Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, accident of April 11, 1987, was caused bythe inattention of a locomotive engineer who failed to control the speedof his train. The NTSB determined that the engineer's use of a medicationcontaining butalbital contributed to probable cause. The engineer had obtainedthe medication from a family member and used it for flu symptoms with thelast dose having been taken a full 24 hours prior to the accident. Theengineer likely did not realize that the plasma half-life of the drug isin excess of 24 hours, permitting successive doses to build up in the body,so that a therapeutic level of the drug remained in his blood at the timeof the accident with potentially sedating effects. The accident resultedin release of hazardous materials and evacuation of 22,000 residents ofnearby neighborhoods and 122 minor injuries; and any accident of this kindhas the potential for much more serious harm to the public. 3. PCP and other hallucinogens may cause personality disorders and delayedeffects long after they cease to be detectable in body fluids. 4. Like those addicted to alcohol, persons addicted to certain centralnervous system depressants and narcotics may suffer severe withdrawal effectsincluding seizures if they fail to use the drug at a maintenance level.5. Railroad medical officers and employee assistance directors participatingin this rulemaking are uniform in their judgments that unauthorized useof controlled substances is a fitness concern for the employer for a varietyof reasons, including the fact that the employee using drugs may be unableto judge the full extent or duration of drug effects. FRA judges theserepresentations to be consistent with the notable commitment of these professionalsto rehabilitation of those willing to accept help. Common sense, clinical experience and the experience of the FRA and itsregulated industry offer persuasive reasons for implementing a drug-freepolicy, as does endorsement of this rulemaking by the National Instituteon Drug Abuse. FRA has noted that this conclusion is also supported in sworn declarationsof a number of experts that have been introduced in evidence in pendinglitigation regarding other drug testing programs. For instance, GeorgeW. Woody, M.D., Chief of the Substance Abuse Treatment Unit at the PhiladelphiaVeterans Administration Medical Center and Professor of Clinical Psychiatryat the University of Pennsylvania described the mental disorders producedby prolonged use of stimulants and hallucinogens, and depression causedby sedative users, both of which were observed ``long after the acute effectsof the drug had ended.'' Dr. Woody noted that a drug use pattern that appearscasual and controlled may change in complexion with great rapidity:<ITAG tagnum="21">[A]lthough a person might initially use a substance of abuse in off-dutyhours and demonstrate little or no impairment on the job, the mere factthat the person uses the drug carries a significant danger that this controlled,sporadic pattern will change to an uncontrolled, abusive pattern in whichhe or she is unable to check their impulses to use the drug. The resultis more frequent use and a greater likelihood of becoming impaired whileat work. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Declaration of George D. Woody, M.D., April 9, 1987, at 4. Dr. MarianFischman of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine indicated thatresidual ``next day'' effects from marijuana use appear to be supportedby recent studies and may be of particular concern if the subject doesnot expect such effects. Dr. Fischman also noted the deleterious residualeffects of chronic use of stimulants. Both Drs. Woody and Fischman defendthe study of pilot performance cited in the NPRM (Yesavage et al., 1985)as soundly designed and suggestive of residual effects from marijuana.These declarations and others of a similar nature were entered in the docketof this rulemaking.  It should not require repeating that there can be no surveillance of employeesduring their off-duty time. The final rule neither authorizes nor requiresany such surveillance. A railroad employee's off-duty time is certainlyhis or her own. But this rule does accomplish two objectives: First, theemployee may not engage in non-authorized use of controlled substances.This merely requires that prescription medication be used as prescribed,that physicians be informed of the safety-sensitive nature of the employee'sduties before prescribing the manner in which the drug may be used (sec.219.103), and that employees not use substances that it would be unlawfulto possess in any event. With respect to conduct during off-duty periods,voluntary compliance is the means of enforcement. Second, the rule providesnotice that an employee who appears on the job with unauthorized controlledsubstances or their metabolites in the employee's system is subject todetection. This prospect, enforced through urine testing, will provideincentives for changed behavior.  Random Testing: Detection and Deterrence  <T3>Comments.</T3> Commenters generally agreed that detection of drug abuseproblems by employed persons seeking to hide their habits is ordinarilynot possible until very advanced stages of dependency, and even then indicatorsdo not point unambiguously to drug abuse, as opposed to other medical orpyschological problems. As Dr. J. Michael Walsh of NIDA stated: <ITAG tagnum="21">Very often the signs and symptoms of impairment for abused drugs aresubtle to both the user and to those around him, especially in the earlystages of abuse, making it almost impossible for friends or co-workersto detect the problem * * *. By the time it is readily detectable it isfar too late normally. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Dr. Walsh noted supervisors may wish to ignore the indications thatthey do receive, because of the great difficulty of dealing with the problemin most employment contexts.  A physician/consultant who has served as the Federal Air Surgeon put itthis way: <ITAG tagnum="21">For illegal drugs there are significant impairments beyond the periodof the ``high.'' These may last for hours and even days. The impairmentsare insideous, subtle and unpredictable, making it almost impossible forfriends or co-workers to detect the problem. </ITAG>A large regional railroad stated that in its experience only about oneof four drug positives detected has been through reasonable suspicion testing,since it is very difficult for supervisors to pick up indicators.  <T3>Conclusions.</T3> FRA found portions of its existing rule provisionson the premise that drug use_even current drug use accompanied by acuteeffects_is not reliably detectable in a clear majority of cases, even bysupervisors who have received a reasonable amount of pertinent training.Experience under FRA's post-accident testing rule and elements of the reasonablecause testing program that do not rely upon individualized reasonable suspicionwas verified and underscored the correctness of this judgment. Severalthousand railroad supervisors have been trained in recognizing the signsand symptoms of drug abuse, and thousands of railroad employees continueto use drugs. Even the drug abuser who may show symptoms will be inclinedto deny to himself that that is the case, thus undercutting the deterrenteffect of a reasonable suspicion testing policy. Quite apart from the difficultyof detecting drug abuse through observations, it is clear that supervisoryobservation could not be an exclusive tool of detection in the railroadindustry because of the long periods during which supervisors are not present.Even where pre-departure supervisory observation is possible, employeescan simply bring drugs into the workplace and use those drugs when theyhave departed their initial terminal (as happened in the Chase, Maryland,accident).  Clearly, some drug use is detectable. Gross intoxication might be noticeableby virtually any supervisor (though the supervisor would need to know whataction to take); supervisors trained in signs and symptoms will be capableof making reasonable suspicion determinations in additional cases; andadvanced dependency is often discernible through supervisory alertnessor careful personnel practices. However, it is a sad fact that the concertedefforts of railroad companies and others to employ these important toolshave shown their limitations. This conclusion is amply supported by testimonyin this proceeding and in the proceeding for review of the current alcohol/drugrule (52 FR 2118; January 20, 1987).  FRA has also noted the consistency of this judgment with expert testimonyby witnesses in district court litigation regarding similar testing programs.For instance Robert L. DuPont, M.D., explained, in a detailed review ofdiagnostic criteria for marijuana and cocaine use, why those criteria areeither not subject to observation by a supervisor or are non-specific (i.e.,occur as symptoms of allergies or illnesses) and thus easily explainedaway by the drug user: <ITAG tagnum="21">[W]hat is primarily affected are the higher brain functions of judgment,decision making, reaction time, and other abilities needed to perform worksafely. Motivation_the process of making a commitment to achieving a goal_isoften profoundly affected by [the type of intoxication caused by] marijuanaor stimulants such as cocaine. The problem is often particularly severewith a heavy or frequent user. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Declaration of Robert L. DuPont, Jr., June 10, 1987, at 2. Dr. SidneyCohen of the University of California at Los Angeles also affirmed thattraditional diagnostic criteria are not readily susceptible to reliableapplication by supervisors. (These declarations were entered in the docketof this rulemaking.)  The difficulty involved in detecting drug use is vividly illustrated bythe experience of the U.S. Navy. Prior to incidents that resulted in disclosureof a major drug problem, Naval officers judged drug abuse to be a problemcapable of being controlled through careful monitoring of performance.But drug testing instituted in 1981 showed a positive rate of 48 percentfor enlisted personnel under the age of 25. Random testing brought thepositive rate for Navy personnel down to the low single-digit range. <T3>See</T3>, e.g., Robert E. Willette, Ph.D., in <T3>Urine Testing for Drugs of Abuse</T3>, Research Monograph No. 73, at6 (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 1986).  Employee representatives contend that other workers know who uses drugs,and after four years of concerted effort prevention teams are doing importantwork to address those who are known to use on the job. However, as theUnion Pacific Railroad, whose employees pioneered Operation Red Block,has noted, voluntary action alone is not enough. It is not enough for atleast two reasons, and it is not possible to say with mathematical certaintywhich of these factors preponderates:  First, Operation Red Block has not yet been extended to all railroads,nor have all union leaders of all crafts accepted the program on any railroad.Indeed, on a national basis coverage remains spotty, with only about halfof railroad employees touched in any way by the program. ``Holdouts'' includeboth railroads and rail unions. This is a program founded on mutual trustand a keen perception of self-interest, as well as a healthy concern forthe fellow employee. Clearly, these are conditions that cannot be mandatedby any statute or regulation.  Second, even where Operation Red Block is in place it cannot succeed byitself. Where tolerance of substance abuse does not exist, some users willstop, but others will take special care to conceal their use, thereby denyingco-workers the leverage necessary to bring about a change in behavior orget the abuser into treatment. In some cases, co-workers may even be unawareof the problem until they witness an unsafe act in the workplace. Further,some drug users simply will not respond in a positive way to expressionsof concern from co-workers.  FRA continues to detect unauthorized use of drugs in mandatory post-accidenttests on railroads that have active Operation Red Block programs, as wellas those that do not. The major western rail system on which OperationRed Block got its start stressed in its testimony in this proceeding itsdissatisfaction with a continuing reasonable cause positive rate of over9 percent. The major eastern rail system that signed the first system-widetesting agreements with its organizations in August of 1987 has 2 post-accidentalcohol/drug positives in the 12 months prior to the agreements and 4 positives(all for illicit drugs) in the subsequent 12 months.  It should be no surprise that Operation Red Block cannot be a completeanswer to the problem, since different people respond to different stimuli.Some will respond to the carrot, some to the stick, some to peer concernand others only to a strong deterrent. This point is best illustrated byone Operation Red Block railroad's call for random testing and institutionby another of a testing agreement.   Random Testing and Voluntary Programs  <T3>Comments.</T3> CSX and employee representatives also expressed thebelief that the imposition of mandatory random testing would underminetrust and cooperation between railway labor and management. This trustis held to be critical to the success of EAP's and Operation Red Block.Thus, it was feared that random testing would undermine the success ofthese programs. Labor also feared that unless these preventive programsare mandated, carriers will tend to rely on random testing to weed outdrug use instead of investing in prevention-oriented programs. Employeerepresentatives postulated a wide range of negative impacts on voluntaryprograms from institution of random testing.  Other commenters, however, contend that random testing would more likelyincrease the importance of EAP's and Red Block. First, the fear of detectionwould drive many users to seek assistance. Second, with the stakes raised,there is no reason to believe that the commitment to these programs fromcounselors, unions or employees would decrease. Finally, the resultingincrease in rehabiliation would give these programs an even more importantrole in combatting drug use. Two carriers indicated that voluntary admissionsto EAP's on their lines increased after testing programs were implemented.Further, all operators who addressed the question stated that the implementationof random testing would not diminish their commitment to or financial supportof preventive programs.  <T3>Conclusions.</T3> There is no doubt that implementation of regulatoryoptions subtly influences a variety of initiatives in the private sector.FRA withheld regulatory action on the issue of alcohol and drugs for overa decade in order to promote and provide the opportunity for the developmentof non-regulatory solutions. During this period, employee assistance programsbecame firmly established and contributed to the well-being of thousandsof railroad employees, the the REAP Report showed that, with respect toalcohol abuse, at least, much remained to be done (Mannello andamp; Seaman,University Research Corp., 1979). FRA began its search for a sound regulatorydesign in 1983, and in the same year the first bypass agreement was signed(protecting Rule G violators who are reported by co-workers). OperationRed Block was implemented on portions of two railroads in 1984, the sameyear FRA proposed the most comprehensive testing program for employeesof a regulated industry that had ever been suggested as of that time. FRAimplemented its final rule in early 1986 despite a major law suit by therail unions, and by 1987 employees of CSX had signed an agreement approvingtesting very similar to that contained in the FRA rule. This history illustratesthat the ``threat'' of regulation can stimulate interest in voluntary action,but it does not establish that regulatory action stifles voluntary action.Indeed, the railroad industry today is involved in more aggressive privatesector programs to address alcohol and drug use than at any previous timein its history.  One can speculate that even more might have been done had regulation beenwithheld, but FRA doubts that would have been the case. Alcohol and drugtesting programs in aid of Federal prohibitions have brought to light theextent of this problem. They have reminded employees that they are theprincipal victims of job-related substance abuse. They have focused publicattention and encouraged responsive measures by management and labor alike. Similarly, one can speculate that requiring random testing may slow thefuture spread of Operation Red Block and similar initiatives by dampeningthe interest of the institutional players (e.g., railroads and employeeorganizations). It can be argued that resources will be diverted, eventhough the railroads uniformly testified that this would not occur. Itcan be argued that employee organizations will lose interest, even thoughthey steadfastly denied that such would be the case. FRA finds none ofthis broad speculation useful for decisional purposes, because it is foundedneither in history nor clear logic. Discussion among the parties at thehearings in this proceeding discounted such effects.  Employee spokesmen also raised the question as to whether co-workers involvedin peer prevention activities (and others who might have been induced toparticipate in the future) may no longer view their role as necessary orappropriate. Some prevention committee members, for instance, may takethe point of view that ``someone else'' is now responsible. Others mayview random testing as so personally objectionable as to drive a wedgebetween them and any effort to address the substance abuse problem. FRAunderstands that these arguments are offered in good faith and cannot discountthe possibility that some of the predicted effects may come to pass withrespect to certain employees. Statutory jurisdiction over railroad safetyconfers no crystal balls through which the future may be foreseen, particularlywhen the motivations of complex human beings are in question. However,FRA views the risk of harm to voluntary programs as a minimal risk thatmust be taken. This judgment is reached with the following points in mind:andbullet; Prior predictions of harm from regulatory action have proven unfounded.andbullet; Random testing may actually strengthen voluntary efforts by heighteningthe risk of detection and thus the susceptibility of the drug user to persuasionby concerned co-worker (while also heightening the concern of the co-workerwho wants to reach his fellow employee before that employee is detectedthrough random testing).andbullet; Where Operation Red Block is not in place because of employeedisinterest and management decides to sanction positive results with severediscipline, random testing will provide renewed incentives for employeesto bargain for Red Block agreements and, in the interim, to utilize theco-worker report provision of the existing rule.andbullet; Operation Red Block and other voluntary efforts will always beimportant to safeguard continued abstinence among those who have been detectedthrough various means and have been provided an opportunity for treatmentand return-to-service. Concerned co-workers who have once affirmed theirrole in prevention will not shrink from the responsibility to assist therecovering employee.In short, FRA is persuaded that the existing strong regulatory programhas strengthened voluntary action and that there is nothing qualitativedifferent about random drug testing that should necessarily result in adifferent outcome. Much depends, of course, on the approach taken by opinionleaders among railroad employees. To a certain extent, they have the powerto make their worst predictions come true; at the same time, they recognizeit is not in the interest of those they serve for this to occur. FRA believesthat employee representatives will continue to recognize the value of voluntaryaction and will communicate that need down through the ranks.Random Testing: Structure of Testing Programs<T3>Comments: </T3>Comments uniformly supported the exclusion of subjectivefactors from the random selection process. However, the railroads requestedtwo types of flexibility. First, they wished to utilize a multi-stage selectionprocess in which geographic units would first be selected on a random basisfor any testing period (e.g., day, week or month). Then employees wouldbe selected randomly within the geographic units. Second, certain of therailroads urged FRA to permit carriers to test different portions of theworkforce at different selection rates, so long as the actual selectionwithin each category is purely random. Geographic variations in drug useprevalence were cited in favor of this distinction, and there was someinterest expressed in targeting a higher level of effort by craft, as well.These alternatives are further described below.The Association of American Railroads (AAR) proposed that the FRA allowrailroads flexibility in setting up random testing programs. As proposedin the NPRM, carriers would submit their proposals to the FRA for approval.FRA would then review the plan to be certain that the carrier program doesnot provide the railroad with an opportunity to discriminate or to harassemployees or union locals. The AAR further believed that all testing programsshould guarantee that each covered employee have a known and non-zero chanceof selection on any given day, but that each employee need not have theexact same chance of selection.As noted above, support for the multi-stage selection process was particularlystrong. A carrier would divide its pool of employees into geographic clusters.On a given day of testing a number of these geographic clusters would berandomly selected. Then, employees within each selected cluster would beselected for testing at random. The carrier would then only have to conducttesting at few locations, rather than having to track down employees allacross an extensive operating system. NIDA agreed that this method is costefficient, pointing to the unit sweeps conducted by the military servicesas an example. (The Department of Transportation uses a similar methodto administer its own random drug testing program.)Some carriers also requested permission to use experience-rating techniquesto target segments of the workforce where drug use is more prevalent. Thesesegments would then be tested at a higher level than others. Targetingon the basis of location, age and craft was suggested. Two commuter linesand organized labor oppose group targeting, however. Labor expressed concernthat geographic targeting could be used to harass an active union local.Employee representatives stated that the mere threat of increased testingcould also have a chilling effect on local union activities. Proponentsof targeting, however, stated that there would be no chance of harassmentbecause all testing plans would have to be approved by the FRA, and alltargeting should be based upon objective statistics which indicate thata particular segment is more prone to drug use.One commenter stated that regardless of whether a multi-stage or experiencerating system is employed, the FRA should do the selection for the carrierin order to assure fairness.Additional flexibility was requested by the Norfolk Southern, which offeredtestimony regarding the permissible period of time during which an employermay test the employee following selection. Norfolk Southern recommendsthat a carrier be permitted to administer the test at its convenience upto six months after the employee has been selected for random testing.Most carriers also indicated an unwillingness to call employees to reportfor solely for testing (even if rested and available), in part out of fearthat drug users among those selected would evade testing by marking offsick or by other means. Many railroads suggested that they be permittedto test an empoyee upon reporting for duty, while on duty, and at the endof a run before marking off duty. While one labor organization is not opposedto testing employees who are merely subject to call, three carrier representativesopposed the use of the extra board for the purpose of calling an employeein to submit to a drug test. They objected to the burdens of having totract the employee down and then pay the employee for the time spent administeringthe test.Few comments were received regarding whether to limit the chance that anemployee will be tested more than once in a testing cycle. The AAR anda major freight railroad stated that an employee should remain in the pool,subject to testing at the same rate as every other employee. One otherrailroad believed that the probability of reselection should remain greaterthan zero, but less than that of unselected employees. Such a scheme wouldhelp to ensure that a greater number of employees is tested during eachcycle, while the threat of testing remains palpable as regarding each individual.The RLEA urged the FRA to recognize that time taken to provide a sampleis not off-duty time. FRA also received comments from four carriers recommendingthat time lost in order to give a drug test should be considered neithertime on-duty nor time-off duty for purposes of the Hours of Service Act.A number of commenters urged FRA to permit on-property collection of samples(<T3>i.e.,</T3> collection at railroad terminals and other railroad facilities).On-property collection would limit the amount of time an employee wouldbe out of service for testing, and could help carriers avoid violationsof the Hours of Service Act. Railroads stated that large amounts of timecan be consumed not only in transporting an employee to the remote facilitybut in waiting for services after arriving at the facility. Limiting theloss of an employee's services would also lower the cost of the programto the carrier. Additionally, it was argued that the chain of custody maybe more secure if testing is done at a carrier facility_i.e., there isa greater chance of mislabeling at a busy emergency room or medical facilitywhere a number of technicians and clerks may handle the sample. In responseto expressed concerns that on-site collection could afford managers anopportunity to harass employees, it was pointed out that all on-site proceduresand facilities would have to meet the requirements of the HHS guidelines.<T3>Conclusions: </T3>It is critical that the railroads have ample flexibilityto implement random testing programs on a basis that will be cost effectiveto the railroad and will not cause undue inconvenience to employees. Programsshould be structred to a maximum extent so that testing can be accomplishedwithin normal duty hours, within legislated Hours of Service Act restrictions,and without delaying the transportation of passengers and freight thatis the railroad's business purpose.<T3>Flexibility in time.</T3> The railroads must first have flexibilityto test at any time during the normal work day, including any period ofallowed overtime. In this regard, it will be noted that the normal workday for through freight service may be any 12-hour portion of any 24-hourperiod. Time spent in deadheading to and from work assignments may furtherconstrain availability. Similarly, yard service and dispatching ``tricks''may be broken into three 8- or 9-hour periods that run around the clock.It will be important for railroads to randomly test employees working atall hours of the day and night. Computer railroads will have differentrequirements, as they endeavor to ensure crew availability for rush hourperiods in the morning and afternoon.The rule allows railroads to develop and submit plans providing for testingat any time an employee is lawfully on duty. Two restrictions apply. First,an employee may not be assigned for testing without first reporting forduty. Only on-duty employees may receive notice that testing is required.This restriction is consistent with concerns raised by employees that theiroff-duty periods could be disturbed and by concerns of the railroads thatattempting to ``call'' employees for testing would risk loss of controlas employees using drugs marked off sick or evaded testing through otherstrategies. Obviously, the final rule does not affect the determinationof when employees are subject to the requirement that they report for duty.That matter is controlled by the collective bargaining agreements and theRailway Labor Act.The second restriction on time availability is the Hours of Service Act.FRA does not enjoy the authority to repeal or modify requirements of thatAct. FRA noted the request of several railroads that time spent in testingand incident to transportation be considered ``limbo time'' (neither on-dutynor off-duty). Legislation passed by the House of Representatives wouldhave made possible such treatment, but FRA is not presently at libertyto take this action administratively. As a consequence, the railroads shouldplan their random testing programs on the assumption that time devotedto random testing (like other forms of testing) is time on duty commingledwith covered service for purposes of the statutory maximums. This wouldnot preclude the railroad's asserting a section 5(d) Hours of Service Actdefense where testing was not completed within prescribed duty limits.However, to succeed with such a defense the railroad would have to provethat the delay was due to an unforeseeable combination of events, and thatit used due diligence to minimize the excess service. Given the preplannednature of random testing, such a showing is far less likely to be madein that context than in the post-accident or reasonable cause context.<T3>Flexibility in space.</T3> Reasonable flexibility in determining thesite of collection wil be crucial to the success of the program. If employees'personal schedules and train operations are not to be routinely disrupted,railroads will have to have the ability to collect samples at sites nearbyto major terminals, crew change points, and other work sites. For thisreason, FRA is authorizing collection at any suitable site, including alocation on railroad property. Railroads are also free to utilize independentmedical facilities and mobile units. For the time being, the requirementthat reasonable cause collections be conducted at independent medical facilitieswill continue. FRA will review this issue along with a number of othersin a future rulemaking.For random testing, collection personnel may include any individual whois qualified by virtue of training or professional/technical experience.Non-medical collectors would be required to have received training in compliancewith the Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs(further described below), and the training program shall be included inthe random testing program submitted for approval. FRA will make availablea model training program setting forth the elements required to be included.Medical professionals and technicians will be deemed qualified to performcollections if, at a minimum, they are provided appropriate instructionsfor collection and certify in each case that they have conducted the collectionas required in the instructions.FRA is keenly aware that collection on the property by employees or contractorsof the railroad may raise issues of neutrality and perceived integrityin the minds of some railroad employees. However, properly conducted collectionwill, by itself, provide reassurance. The testing procedures provide thatspecimen bottles will be filled, identified and secured with a tamper-proofseal in the presence of the employee. The employee then affirms the identityof the specimen by initialling the label/seal. In reporting any test result,the laboratory must certify that the seal was intact upon receipt. Recognizingthe sensitivity involved in collection of the sample, FRA has also providedthat the collector may not be a person in the chain of command above theemployee or a co-worker. Railroads are encouraged to take additional actionsto provide reassurance to employees that the testing process is being conductedin a fair and impartial manner, and, of course, to include these stepsin their proposed programs submitted to FRA for approval. Moreover, theDOT Procedures for testing (more fully described below prohibit observedcollection except under very limited circumstances, and railroad supervisionwould not be permitted to participate in such observation.Random Testing Programs: Level of Effort<T3>Comments: </T3>FRA received varying recommendations concerning theoptimum level of testing. Commenters generally appeared to agree that noconsistent incidence of unauthorized drug use was acceptable at any statisticallevel, but there was wide variance of opinion with respect to the rateof testing that would be appropriate given current drug prevalence information.Several commenters acknowledged that there is no evidence from civilianexperience indicating what percentage of a population should annually betested under a random testing program.However, it was also noted that the testing rates of certain of the militaryservices (125 percent to 240 percent) would not be appropriate for therailroad employee population, which is older and more stable (lower turnover)and has a lower drug use incidence rate than that experienced by the militaryservices when their programs began. Some suggested that the FRA only establishminimum and maximum permissible levels, allowing the carrier to choosea level meeting its own needs and philosophy.The AAR and a number of railroads stated that an adequate deterrent wouldbe posed if fifteen percent of the workforce is subjected to short noticetesting during the course of a year. Within that fifteen percent at leastfive percent would have to based on random selection. Other railroads generallyrecommended testing levels between ten and thirty-one percent. The onlyunion to address the subject suggested a target rate of twelve and one-halfpercent.A significant portion of commenters suggested somewhat higher levels, however.A major commuter authority considered fifty percent to be optimum, whilethe NTSB, Safe Travel America, a commuter authority and a major freightrailroad believed that a level as high as 125 percent may be needed toeffect a credible deterrent (though not all would mandate this level asminimum).Another commenter suggested that a rate under 100 percent would createa perception of ``the finite possibility of detection'' and thus shouldbe sufficient to deter, but indicated that it would be wise to vary therate on an annual basis to determine the yield of various rates. Whilestrongly supporting random testing, the AAR stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">Setting an unrealistically high level of effort as a mandatory minimum,with no scientific investigation of the relationship between the samplingfraction and the deterrent effect, would impose a burden the railroadswould be forced to live with for a considerable length of time. Once requirementssuch as this are written into federal regulations it is extremely difficultand time consuming to change them.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Finally, a major freight railroad states:<ITAG tagnum="21">[W]e wish to emphasize * * * that the deterrence value of any randomtesting program, even one requiring a high level of effort, e.g., testing100 percent of employees annually, would decline dramatically if employeeswho test positive for illegal drugs or alcohol were assured freedom fromdiscipline as little as one time only.</ITAG><T3>Conclusions: </T3>Random drug testing will have two complementary objectives;detection and deterrence. Reliable detection is critical not only to removingthe addicted substance abuser from the workplace but also to establishingan atmosphere of deterrence. However, random testing will work in concertwith other means of detection and deterrence and thus should be viewedas one element in an overall program of countermeasures.Commenters agreed that current drug testing programs that involve short-noticetesting, such as post-accident testing and reasonable cause testing, doproduce an important deterrent effect and have obviously led to the identificationof many employees with drug abuse problems. Medically-based testing programsalso provide a means of detection, although the advance notice customarilyassociated with this form of testing makes its direct deterrent value minimal(since drug users, knowing they will be tested at a scheduled appointment,may be able to abstain for the short period necessary to avoid detection).The overall target level of deterrent effect that would be most cost effectiveand reasonable from the point of view of burdens on employees and transportationis not possible to determine at the outset of a random testing program.However, the record of this rulemaking has provided FRA with a sense ofconfidence that a moderate but substantial level of testing at the outsetshould address the drug deterrence need on most railroads while avoidingunnecessary burdens. As a consequence, the final rule will require thatthe railroads actually collect and analyze specimens from a number of randomlyselected employees sufficient to equal in number 50 percent of the relevantemployee population. The rule provides flexibility to allow for gradualstart-up of the program.In a supplemental notice, FRA will propose procedures to allow eventualadjustment of the testing level, by railroad, as a uniform experience baseis established and differing needs are documented. That notice will alsopropose to allow the railroads to credit other short-notice testing (reasonablecause and post-accident) to the required level of effort for random testing.FRA believes that the railroad industry will remain unique with respectto the significant number of for-cause tests conducted. FRA is furtherconcerned that failure to allow for this credit would discourage railroadsfrom continuing aggressive reasonable cause testing programs, which inquireinto fitness following unsafe practices. However, these are issues developedduring the current rulemaking that deserve prompt but separate considerationto complete the program design.Drugs Tested<T3>Comments: </T3>The HHS Guidelines require Federal agencies to testfor marijuana and cocaine and authorize random testing for opiates, amphetamines,and PCP. Agencies may test for other Schedule I and II drugs in post-accident,unsafe practice and reasonable suspicion situations, if HHS has approvedthe analytical methods. On the face of the Guidelines, it appears thatHHS will also accept agency applications to add additional Schedule I/IIdrugs to the five specified for random testing. The NPRM proposed to requirerandom testing for the five HHS drugs and to authorize testing for additionalsubstances under certain circumstances.Comments were received requesting that the FRA allow carriers to test fordrugs other than the five specified by the HHS guidelines. It was arguedthat there are many drugs not covered by the guidelines whose use willhave a detrimental effect on the safety of rail operations. Only one drugtesting expert testified that extending the list of tested drugs is notnecessary at this time, the present five being by far the most prevalent.There was strong support among other experts and a number of carriers forthe addition of barbiturates and benzodiazepines, in particular. It wasstated that the use of these drugs is sufficiently prevalent to cause concern,and that a shift toward use of these drugs can be anticipated if they arenot tested for.An employee assistance manager of a regional railroad stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">[Barbiturates and benzodiazepines] have addictive properties and arewidely available from a variety of sources. They affect reaction timesand attention spans detrimentally, and pose as real a threat as other substanceswhen used in an operating environment.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Several railroad medical officers participating in the proceedingwere also strongly supportive of testing for central nervous system depressants.The NTSB supported testing for these drugs and lower-scheduled narcotics,as well.An official of the National Institute on Drug Abuse testified that post-accidenttesting should continue for the broadest range of drugs feasible, regardlessof any limitations that might be placed on more routine testing.The Epilepsy Foundation opposed testing for barbiturates, since it coulddisclose to employers therapeutic drug use among epileptics whose seizuredisorders are fully controlled, potentially leading to job discrimination.<T3>Conclusions:</T3> The current alcohol/drug rule authorizes reasonablecause testing for any controlled substance, regardless of schedule or treatmentfor criminal law purposes. In the prior rulemaking, the American MedicalAssociation and other commenters had agreed that the controlled substancelist adequately defines those compounds of greatest concern with respectto the fitness of employees responsible for safe movement of transportationvehicles. Railroads are presently required to conduct pre-employment testingfor drugs other than those mandated for random testing by this final rule.FRA believes that the random testing rule, and testing procedures applicableto pre-employment and reasonable cause testing, must be sufficiently flexibleto address known substance abuse problems and to address changing substanceabuse patterns. FRA is already aware that abuse of barbiturates is a smallbut significant problem on the railroads. There is every reason to believethat misuse of benzodiazepines (sedative-hypnotics) may also be a problem(<T3>see,</T3> e.g., <T3>Data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network,</T3> Series G, Number 21at 70 (National Institute on Drug Abuse, Statistical Series, July-December1987)), though drug testing technology is struggling to keep up with detectionrequirements for low-dosage tranquilizers that have recently come to dominatethe market. Drugs that impair vigilance are a particular problem on a railroad,since employees are required to maintain alertness at all hours of theday and night under circumstances sometimes involving minimal externalstimuli.Random testing itself has the potential to alter the mix of substance abuseto some extent, as some abusers elect to use compounds other than thoseincluded in random testing. New drugs will be introduced into licit andillicit markets that may become new drugs of choice for some railroad employees.It is crucial that the testing system be sufficiently flexible to permitdetection of additional drugs without the additional delays involved inrulemaking.Although experience under the current rule has not revealed any analyticaldeficiencies among the laboratories currently providing services to therailroads, FRA nevertheless agrees that more highly structured and intensivequality control measures can provide an important measure of reassuranceto employees while also verifying that true positives are reliably identifiedand confirmed. The HHS laboratory certification program provides a logicalframework for this effort. However, HHS approval of testing for other drugswill not be available to private sector employers (who are simply not withinthe scope of the Guidelines).With respect to testing for barbiturates, FRA is not persuaded that railroademployers would discriminate against persons with epileptic conditionsbased on barbiturate use detected in testing authorized under this finalrule. The Epilepsy Foundation cited no instances of job discriminationby rail employers, who already test for barbiturates in their medical programsand reasonable cause testing programs, as well as under FRA's mandate forpre-employment drug screens. Railroad medical review officers would, ofcourse, maintain in confidentiality any information concerning documentedprescription use of these drugs.Therefore, FRA will propose in a supplemental notice a revised procedureunder which railroads may request approval for testing of other controlledsubstances, with appropriate safeguards to ensure the quality of laboratoryanalysis.HHS Guidelines and Testing Safeguards<T3>Comments:</T3> Commenters expressed widespread approval of the HHSGuidelines as an adequate means of assuring integrity in the administrationof random testing programs. Labor organizations tended to accept the Guidelinesin their entirety, while a few railroads proposed some minor changes.The Equal Employment Advisory Council (EEAC) recommends that the FRA allowcarriers the option of testing under the HHS Guidelines or under a planof their own which is at least as effective in protecting employees frominaccurate results.Four commenters believe that the HHS Guideline threshold level of 100 nanogramsper milliliter (ng/ml) for marijuana should be lowered. They stated that100 ng/ml is far higher than the level one might reasonably expect to findin a passive smoker. It was argued that maintaining a high level wouldonly serve to lower the detection rate for casual users of marijuana. Levelsin the 10 to 50 ng/ml range were recommended. PharmChem, Inc., however,stated that the 100 ng/ml threshold is adequate to protect passive smokerswhile assuring that very few actual users escape detection.Dr. Arthur J. McBay suggested that the FRA go a step beyond the Guidelinesand require specimen splitting. Dr. McBay suggested that one portion besent forward to the laboratory for testing and the other be retained infrozen storage. In the case of a contested positive, the retained portioncould be divided, with one part being made available to the employer andthe other to the employee for retesting. This procedure was said to address``chain of custody, mislabelling, specimen switching, contamination, carryover,instrumental, technician and reporting errors.'' Amtrak indicated thatit uses a similar system for its corporate testing program.All commenters agreed that GC/MS methods are highly accurate. One commenter,however, stated that GC/MS should not be mandated because it is expensive,and that the GC/MS requirement should be changed if a more accurate formof testing becomes available. Dr. Arthur J. McBay stated that the ruleshould specify that full mass spectra analysis is required.The Syva Co., fearing that the HHS may be slow in certifying laboratories,suggested that FRA recognize state certification of labs.Two carriers and three members of the drug testing industry urged FRA toallow screening of urine samples at the testing location. All samples whichinitially tested positive would then be sent to a competent lab for confirmation.This procedure would allow operators to immediately remove from servicethose employees who have tested positive in the initial screen. Those whosepositive results are not confirmed would be reinstated with back pay. Labcosts would be lowered since only samples with an initial positive wouldbe sent to testing laboratories. Additionally, it was argued, most employeeswould be spared the fear and uncertainty which was said to accompany thewait for lab results. Proponents of on-site screening acknowledged thatthe initial screen is not as accurate as a GC/MS confirmation. However,they contended that false positives would actually inflict harm only ina minute number of cases, since not more than 5 percent of those testingpositive (a minority in itself) would have the outcome reversed on confirmation.All commenters addressing the subject believed that there are sufficientqualified testing facilities nationwide to handle the increase in testingwhich would result from implementation of the FRA rule. NIDA indicatedthat its certification program is reviewing 100 laboratories, one of whichcould handle all Federal employee specimens, with more than ample capacityin remaining laboratories to competently analyze additional samples fromtransportation operators.<T3>Conclusions: </T3>The HHS Guidelines offer state-of-the-art proceduresfor collection of specimens, chain-of-custody, laboratory analysis andreview and handling of test results. The Guidelines draw on extensive experiencein the perfection and validation of military drug testing programs andwere adopted for the Federal workplace program after notice and opportunityfor comment. FRA agrees that the Guidelines should set the standard forurine drug testing in transportation. However, based on comments receivedand experience under the current rule, it is clear that the Guidelinesrequire modest modification to fit the demands of a geographically dispersedtransportation industry and non-Federal workplaces.<T3>Proposals to loosen the Guidelines' requirements.</T3> Various partiesfound the Guidelines excessively burdensome or inflexible in some respectaffecting their interests. FRA has carefully considered each of these suggestionsand responds to the more substantive ones in the discussion which follows.FRA respectfully disagrees with those commenters who would modify the Guidelinesto permit on-site screening of urine samples. FRA recognizes the obviousadvantages provided by this method, which have been intelligently advancedby several commenters, including two major railroads that use this techniquein their present company plans. However, FRA agrees with the rationaleexpressed in the preamble to the Guidelines for requiring ``same-site''screening and confirmation (53 FR 11970, 11972; April 11, 1988); and FRAdisfavors on-site screening for the following additional reasons:1. There is no effective way to quality-control, on-site screening to ensurepositives are being detected at the prescribed cut-off. ``Blind'' proficiencytesting samples would be readily identified in such a setting.2. ``New'' technologies advocated by vendors for on-site screening haveinherent limitations. One such system, for instance, is cross-reactivefor four different drugs to a 300 ng/ml cut-off. Apart from yielding someunconfirmed positives, the system would apparently be largely ineffectivefor PCP, for which the Guidelines set a 25 ng/ml detection limit, whiledetecting amphetamines below the uniform HHS level. Data submitted by thisvendor was limited to two reviews of a single set of tests that coveredonly two drugs based on tests under laboratory conditions. Although thissystem may have many very valuable applications, FRA is not prepared tostructure a national program around a proprietary product still undergoingrefinement.3. Based on experience with its post-accident testing program, which hasutilized the two principal immunoassay systems as well as other screeningtechniques, FRA believes that a small but not insignificant rate of falseor unconfirmed positives will continue to occur in screening tests regardlessof whether analysis is performed on site or at a laboratory. Although thereis merit in providing immediate feedback to employees who screen negative,there is also a hazard that in a locally administered system the personwith a presumptive positive will be singled out. Certainly any system thatheld the individual out of service would do so, and advocates of on-sitescreening contend that the ability to remove the presumed drug user fromthe workplace is a major advantage of this approach. With no disrespectintended to those railroads and others advocating on-site screening, FRAis not willing to incur the threat to the reputations and peace of mindof the great majority of employees who do not use drugs that such an approachwould entail. Despite education efforts by FRA, the railroads and the labororganizations, the technical aspects of drug testing are still poorly understoodby many railroad officers and employees. The risk that a presumptive positivecould be viewed as a badge of dishonor is simply too great to entertainin a program mandated by Federal regulation. Random testing will producethe desired safety impacts if it deters use among non-dependent users,increases incentives for early referral among dependent users, and gradually,over a period of months or years, supplements other means of identifyingthose who persist in their abuse. Early removal of a single employee identifiedas presumptively positive is not, therefore, as critical to the accidentprevention program as suggested by some of the commenters.FRA also disagrees with a railroad that blind proficiency testing requirementsof Guidelines should not be extended to the rail random testing program.Blind proficiency testing is one of the critical means of ensuring thatlaboratories are delivering high quality services. Blind proficiency testingis also critical to employee acceptance, as evidenced by the strong employeesupport for the CSX testing agreements, which embody this safeguard. FRAincludes both open and blind proficiency testing in its quality controlprogram for mandatory post-accident testing (which involves both bloodand urine specimens) and believes that there is no impediment from thepoint of view of feasibility to including this element in the random testingprogram.FRA disagrees with the suggestion that it would be sufficient for the railroadsto utilize certified laboratories, since those laboratories will be routinelyproficiency tested by Federal agencies. Some HHS-certified labs may neverseek or win contracts to test Federal employee specimens and thus may neverbe subject to blind testing. While others will have such contracts, thisis no better indication of capability than actual performance. Given thelarge volumes of railroad employee samples this program will generate,it is important to know that true positives are being detected and to documentthat negatives are being so reported.Blind proficiency testing will involve some cost and logistical preparation,but any large employer should be capable of obtaining and utilizing thisservice from an expert contractor. FRA is persuaded that smaller railroadsmay find it costly on a per unit and overhead basis to participate in blindproficiency testing. Thus, under the Procedures for Transportation WorkplaceDrug Testing Programs (further described elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>), the blind testing requirement is limited toemployers submitting 1,000 or more samples per year for analysis. Smalleremployers are not required to submit blind samples if they are utilizinga laboratory that is subject to blind testing by a Federal agency or anothertransportation employer.<T3>Cut-offs.</T3> The HHS Guidelines provide uniform administrative detectionlimits or cut-offs for each of the 5 drug groups for which testing is authorized.FRA appreciates the concerns of those commenters who believe a 100 ng/mlscreening cut-off for marijuana metabolites is excessively high. However,FRA believes that this cut-off will permit identification of the greatmajority of regular or recent marijuana users, since the available assaysdetect ``total cannabinoids'', rather than being specific to the targetmetabolite (normally the 9-carboxy acid of THC). Data from FRA post-accidenttesting suggests that most confirmed positives at a 20 ng/ml level forconfirmation screen over 100 ng/ml (for total metabolites). (FRA's post-accidentprotocol currently detects at 20 ng/ml on both screening and confirmationin order to identify the casual user who may have used just prior to anaccident and whose specimen is collected early in the process of metabolismand elimination.) Further, the high cut-off virtually eliminates any possibilityof a positive result from (claimed) passive inhalation.<T3>Confirmation method.</T3> FRA disagrees with one commenter who wouldallow methods of confirmation other than gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.The commenter is correct in indicating that scientific advances may allowfor better analytical methods of equal or greater specificity, but FRAbelieves that currently requiring the best available method on the faceof the rule (rather than by implication, as with the current regulation)will provide reassurance to employees and avoid dispute and confusion.If better methods are validated and are available at reasonable cost, FRAcan revise the rule to recognize the scientific or technological advance.FRA likewise does not agree that full spectrum GC/MS analysis should bespecified by the rule, since sophisticated single and multiple-ion protocolsare available, most utilizing a deuterated internal standard, that arespecific for the target compounds while offering good sensitivity and excellentquantitation at the cut-off. Expert inspection teams are reviewing eachlaboratory's GC/MS method to ensure specificity, accuracy and reliabilityfor the 5 drug groups, and similar reviews would be required before additionaldrugs are added. <T3>Laboratory certification.</T3> FRA does not agree with the commentthat state licensure of laboratories should be recognized in the rule,nor is FRA prepared to accept accreditation by voluntary bodies absentHHS recognition. Laboratories conducting testing under FRA's existing ruletypically hold one or more Federal or state licenses for various purposes.However, the HHS certification program is the first highly rigorous certificationprogram specifically targeted at urine drug testing at the Federal level.The HHS Guidelines provide national standards for recognition and periodicreview. By contrast, only a handful of states have aggressive licensureprograms for drug testing laboratories. FRA believes that the uniform baselineprovided by the HHS Guidelines is important to consistent and effectiveimplementation of safeguards. Uniformity is particularly important giventhe interstate nature of the railroads' business and the variety of jurisdictionson which railroad employees work. <T3>Split specimen.</T3> HHS considered a split sample requirement butrejected it for reasons FRA adopts. HHS stated, in part, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">[S]uch a system could increase the risk of administrative error bydoubling the labeling, initialing, storage, and accountability requirements.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">53 FR 11971; April 11, 1988. The railroad context presents a starkexample of the problems with this approach. Employees' principal concernwith respect to the testing process is often actions of the railroad companyitself. In this regard, it would hardly add credibility to the system tohave the railroad retain spliy samples in its possession. Some of the other reasons often given for use of split samples often turnout not to bear scrutiny. Chain-of-custody and labeling problems, for instance,typically relate to handling prior to delivery to the laboratory. It islikely that any problem relating to a single sample would infect both (e.g.,improper identification, broken chain-of-custody at site of collection).If there is an error at the laboratory, retention of the original (single)sample will allow for retesting. <T3>Lab capacity.</T3> FRA believes that more than adequate certified laboratorycapacity will exist to provide for quality analysis. Implementation ofthis program is, of course, contingent upon timely certifications beingissued by HHS. <T3>Adoption of Testing Procedures.</T3> In the NPRM for this rule, FRAproposed that all drug testing take place in accordance with the MandatoryGuidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs of the Departmentof Health and Human Services (53 FR 11970; April 11, 1988). Those guidelinesdescribe the collection and testing procedures applicable to all drug testingof Federal employees, and they include safeguards for the accuracy andprivacy of testing. FRA also specifically solicited comment on adaptationof the Guidelines to meet the special circumstances of the regulated industry.Based upon comments submitted in this docket and other information, theDepartment of Transportation has determined that certain modificationsto the procedures of the Guidelines are appropriate in the context of thisand other DOT operating administration drug testing regulations. Accordingly,the Department's Office of the Secretary is publishing elsewhere in today's<T4>Federal Register</T4> an Interim Final Rule with Request for Commentsentitled ``Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs,''that codifies the Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines fordrug testing at 49 CFR Part 40. These DOT Procedures are intended to implementthe important safeguards provided by the HHS Guidelines and set forth requirementsfor specimen collection, laboratory certification, and quality assurance.As previously noted, during the comment period on the NPRM in this proceeding,comments were received concerning the HHS Guidelines, as summarized above.These comments will be incorporated in the docket for the Office of theSecretary (OST) interim final rule creating 49 CFR Part 40. The OST willfurther respond to those comments, as well as comments received duringthe comment period for Part 40, in its notice following the end of thatcomment period. Hair Analysis <T3>Comments: </T3>Two companies supported an alternative to urinalysis.The commenters advocated analysis of hair by radio immunoassay (RIA). Thehair is subjected to a proprietary extraction process and then analyzedin a manner similar to any other specimen, with presumptive positives confirmedby GC/MS. The commenters urge that this approach will produce an accuratetest result without the inconvenience and intrusion of urine collection.A major advantage of this approach is the enlarged ``window of detection''.According to the commenters, since hair analysis can track drug use whichoccurred months in the past, there would be no need to test randomly. <T3>Conclusions: </T3>Analysis of hair for drugs of abuse may offer promisingpossibilities for the future, and the commenters pointed out that manyuseful applications are already being made. However, as with any new proprietarytechnology being developed for commercial use, a number of issues of practicalityremain to be settled. There seems to be little dispute that drugs, wheneliminated through hair growth, can be detected for an extended period.However, issues such as detection limits, sampling methods, quality controlof the extraction process, interpretation of opiate results, etc., shouldbe thoroughly reviewed by the Department of Health and Human Services beforelarge scale applications can be mandated or authorized. Further, it mustbe clear that an adequate laboratory capability exists to apply the technology.Rehabilitation and Discipline <T3>Comments: </T3>The FRA received numerous comments on what the consequencesof a positive drug test should be. Two carriers, the labor organizationsand certain other commenters believe that the regulation should requirecarriers to give an employee an opportunity for rehabilitation. It wassuggested that drug use be treated like any other medical condition. Itwas pointed out that the employee could still be disciplined if drug useresulted in a violation of a carrier operating rule. These commenters alsoindicated that if rehabilitation is required, it should be a one time opportunity_i.e.,recidivists should not be extended a second opportunity at rehabilitation.Opponents of mandatory rehabilitation included railroads, members of thedrug testing industry, and public interest groups. Numerous commentersstated that the deterrent effect of random testing would be completelyundermined if drug users are not disciplined after a positive result. Withoutthe threat of discipline, there would be little incentive for an employeeto discontinue use until detected. Safe Travel America stated its beliefthat a policy of mandatory rehabilitation would undermine Operation RedBlock programs by discouraging early referrals. Short lines stated thatthey could not afford to rehabilitate an employee and could not find atemporary replacement to perform the employee's duties during a periodof rehabilitation. A number of railroads uged the FRA to leave decisions regarding disciplineand rehabilitation entirely up to the carrier. Some contended that eachcase is different, and therefore management should have the flexibilityto act in a manner appropriate to each case. <T3>Conclusions: </T3>In general, the policy of FRA under current regulationsis to allow flexibility for handling under corporate policies and collectivebargaining agreements when an employee's drug use is disclosed by bodyfluid testing or other means of detection available to management. FRAhas extensively dealt with this issue in prior rulemaking proceedings.With respect to the consequences of random testing, FRA believes that thepublic safety can best be advanced by continuing to provide the privatesector parties with flexibility to fashion reasonable responses. Wherelabor and management are able to establish a relationship of trust, theywill put in place Operation Red Block agreements allowing those whose druguse has been detected to return to service after treatment in probationarystatus (or withholding discipline entirely on a first offense) in exchangefor active employee involvement in prevention, referral and (where no alternativeexists) identification under the co-worker report rule. Where labor-managementcooperation cannot be effected, the threat of disciplinary sanctions flowingfrom detection will provide a powerful deterrent to volitional use of drugswhile creating a strong incentive for the dependent user to step forwardand ask for help before detection in a random test. Mandating discipline or disqualification in every case would bar railroadsfrom participating in Operation Red Block agreements, which aid safetyto the extent that they encourage employee participation in substance abuseprevention and enforcement. Mandating the opportunity for rehabilitationin every case would greatly reduce the incentives for early self-referralsand co-worker referrals. On either extreme, Federal intervention wouldeliminate the mutuality of consideration inherent in the Operation RedBlock concept. The final rule does require that an employee determined to have used drugswithout appropriate medical authorization be removed from covered service.The employee may not be returned to covered service. The employee may notbe returned to covered service unless the employee has submitted a negativeurine sample and has completed any appropriate program of rehabilitation.Nothing in the rule requires that an employee determined to have violatedthe drug use prohibition be retained in the employ of the railroad.   Post-Rehabilitation Testing and After-care Monitoring <T3>Comments:</T3> The FRA received various recommendations concerningfollow-up testing of employees who have completed rehabilitation aftertesting positive in a random test. Commenters generally agree that FRAshould give carriers wide latitude in post-rehabilitation testing, permittingthe carrier to vary the frequency and duration of such testing on a caseby case basis. Recommendations on an adequate period of follow-up testingvaried from one to three years. Comments were received indicating thatthree to four tests per year may be sufficient.<T3>Conclusions:</T3> Continuing treatment and follow-up testing of employeesreturned to service are important measures from the point of view of therecovering substance abuser and the public safety. Although this rule doesnot require that persons testing positive be afforded the opportunity forrehabilitation, it is inevitable that many will be offered that opportunity,particularly many testing positive for the first time. The knowledge thata follow-up test may be required can assist the recovering employee andoffer important assurance from the point of view of the public safety.As a consequence, the final rule provides that, after returning to work,a recovering employee must continue in any program of aftercare requiredby the EAP counselor (as defined in the current rule to include medicalor employee assistance professional personnel) and be subject to follow-uptesting for not longer than 60 months after return to service. Professionalsdesignated by the railroad are free to work out a reasonable program offollow-up testing based on the nature and severity of the use or dependencyproblem identified through clinical evaluation.Confidentiality of Test Results<T3>Comments: </T3>Commenters are in general agreement that the HHS Guidelinesoffer adequate protection to employees. The Epilepsy Foundation of Americais satisfied that the HHS Guidelines prohibit MRO's from divulging to managementthe existence of an epileptic condition in an employee.Carriers believe they must be free to divulge test results in at leasttwo circumstances: pursuant to a bona fide government inquiry or discoveryrequest, and when necessary to protect the railroad during legal proceedings.In addition to these instances, FRA received comment on the propriety ofpermitting operators to divulge an employee's testing history to a subsequentemployer engaged in transportation. A handful of commenters stated thatin the interests of safety a carrier should be permitted to inform a subsequentemployer of an employee's past drug habits. Others believed that an employeeshould not be permanently encumbered by a single positive test result.Strong opposition to dissemination was expressed by the Epilepsy Foundationof America and the EEAC, while one carrier commented that at the very leastthe period during which the information can be divulged should be limitedto no more than one year following completion of rehabilitation. Anothercommenter suggested that dissemination be permitted only if the employeefailed to be rehabilitated.Railroads and their representatives took the position that disclosure oftest results in the context of a disciplinary proceeding would be the responsibilityof the employee demanding the investigation or asserting the grievance(i.e., the employee would have waived confidentiality).<T3>Conclusions:</T3> The purpose of random testing and other forms oftesting authorized by the current rule is to detect and deter drug usein violation of stated prohibitions in order to ensure safety of the publicand railroad employees. Test results that reveal medical use of controlledsubstances are subject to the individual's personal privacy interest inmedical information, as is drug use information provided by the employeein order to permit informed interpretation of the test result. However,revealing such use to the railroad's medical review officer, who is undera duty not to republish the information, is not a material intrusion onthe employee's privacy interest, since railroad employees have historicallybeen subject to medical qualifications standards of the railroads. FRAagrees that this information need go no further than the medical reviewofficer, and the final rule so provides. (The final rule prescribes a similarrestriction on medical use disclosed through post-accident testing, subjectto the need of Federal agencies investigating serious railroad accidentsto have all information relevant to accident/incident causation.)Test results indicating non-medical use of controlled substances are notsubject to any recognized privacy interest. In most cases, such resultswill indicate ingestion of drugs that it is illegal to possess. However,requiring that this information be handled confidentially will tend toreduce the perceived intrusiveness of the testing process, and no legitimatesafety purpose would be served by excessively broad publication of thisinformation.As a consequence, the final rule and the DOT Procedures require confidentialhandling of test results and medical information provided by the employeeto aid interpretation of the results. In the case of test results, disseminationis limited to those persons necessarily involved in administrative actionrelated to the drug use indicated by the test. Disclosure of test resultsby the railroad is permitted only with the written consent of the employee.The rule does not bar FRA or NTSB use of post-accident test results foraccident investigation purposes (and disclosure incident to that process),carrier disclosure of aggregate statistics where such disclosure wouldnot identify an individual, or FRA access to test records for regulatorycompliance purposes. Subsequent employers may obtain information concerning past drug testingunder the rule only if the employee or applicant consents to disclosure.Obviously, nothing in the rule prohibits railroads entertaining applicationsfrom persons with railroad experience from requiring such consents as acondition of the hiring action. Alternative Strategies_The NTSB Alcohol/Drug Study The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) weighed in with brief commentsand the 159-page Safety Study noted above. The NTSB Alcohol/Drug Studysurveyed the 1987 accident experience for railroads and rail transit, reviewedrailroad activities to address alcohol/drug problems, and proposed a lengthylist of further initiatives. This document is a useful compendium of recent accident/incident data reflectingthe consequences of alcohol and drug use by railroad and rail transit employees.However, FRA disagrees in material respects with many of the Study's conclusionsand recommendations. While offering a variety of recommendations on program implementation,NTSB stated as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Conceptually, the Safety Board views the FRA rule (with modificationsthat are addressed in this study) as the model approach for Federal regulationto reduce alcohol and/or drug use in the transportation industry.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Board went on to make a long list of recommendations which FRAwill carefully consider on their individual merits. They are reviewed herein the context of the current regulatory proposal, which was issued priorto the NTSB report, since they were characterized by the Board as alternativesto random testing. <T3>Post-accident testing recommendations.</T3> The first group of NTSBrecommendations relate to mandatory post-accident toxicological testing(49 CFR Part 219, Subpart C). This program involves collection of bloodand urine samples from employees involved in serious railroad accidents.The multifaceted rationale for this program was described in the preambleto the current rule (50 FR 31508, 31541-31542; Aug. 2, 1985), but a majorobjective of the program is to provide data pertinent to accident/incidentcausation. FRA has strictly limited its scope, because the taking of bloodsamples is physically invasive and should be required only where thereis a reasonably compelling public interest. Testing is currently requiredafter any train accident involving a fatality, hazardous material evacuationor railroad property damage in excess of $500,000. Testing is also requiredafter employee fatalities and ``impact'' train accidents that involve personalinjuries or at least $50,000 in damage. With the experience gained throughmandatory post-accident testing to date and the deployment of additionalcountermeasures through regulatory and voluntary action, FRA looks forwardto modest further reductions in the scope of this program. NTSB, by contrast,would dramatically expand mandatory post-accident testing by_ andbullet; Lowering the damage threshold for nonimpact accidents to $150,000,using replacement cost as the basis for computation, and including lossof lading; andbullet; Expanding the scope of those tested beyond employees covered bythe Hours of Service Act; andbullet; Requiring testing after impact accidents even if the dollar thresholdfor reportability (currently $5,200) is not exceeded; and andbullet; Requiring collection of post-accident specimens within 4 hours.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The NTSB estimated that adoption of these recommendations would leadto testing after 600 accidents annually (currently less than 200) and leadto blood/urine sampling of over 6,000 employees (currently about 800).In support of these changes the NTSB cited several derailments in 1987for which testing was not done because of differences between railroaddamage estimates at the accident scene and later computations either bythe railroad or by the NTSB. FRA believes that major expansion of the current postaccident testing programis not warranted. The program is already the most extensive program providingfull toxicology for fatalities and survivors that is in place for any modeof transportation. In order to be effective and check the exercise of discretionby administering personnel, testing must be done under a relatively rigidmandate. The NTSB recommendation would result in testing after a largenumber of derailments, the vast majority of which are caused by track orequipment or an interaction between the two (in contrast to collision-typeevents for which human factors predominate). The current program designexcludes testing in this setting except with respect to the most seriousaccidents. Indeed, of the 4 accidents cited by the Board as examples ofthe need for more inclusive standards for testing, none appears to haveinvolved human factors. Further, the Board's suggestion that a 4-hour outside limit be put on post-accidenttesting_a limit which the Board would allow to be exceeded where necessityrequired_amounts to tinkering with a requirement that already requiresthat collection be given first priority after immediate safety responseand medical care for those injured. FRA does not disagree that prompt collectionis the objective, but sees little gain in a complicated formula that says,in effect, test as soon as possible, but not later than 4 hours, but after4 hours if necessary. FRA does not mean to imply that changes in the program may not be appropriate.FRA understands the view of the Board, for instance, that additional safety-sensitiveemployees could be included in post-accident testing. However, inclusionshould be tightly justified, and suggestions that ``all'' ``safety sensitive''personnel be tested continue to beg the question of whom and under whatcircumstances. This is an issue FRA intends to revisit in a subsequentrulemaking. Marginal changes in post-accident testing coverage, however,can hardly be expected to have direct and immediate impacts on overalldeterrence of drug use. <T3>Medical certification program.</T3> The Board devotes less than a pageof discussion to its recommendation that FRA institute a medical certificationprogram for railroad employees. The apparent purpose and justificationfor having the railroads issue medical certificates to thousands of employeeswould be to have a certificate to revoke should alcohol or drug use bedetected. FRA cannot imagine a more indirect and costly means of accomplishingan objective that may be accomplished directly, particularly in light ofFRA's recent acquisition of statutory authority to apply sanctions to individuals.The Board recognizes that major railroads already have medical certificationprograms. It cites no systemic deficiencies in those program, documentsno pattern of rail accidents caused by medical conditions other than misuseof alcohol or drugs, and gives no consideration to the effect of enforcingsuch a program on effective use of FRA's limited budget and personnel.Without prejudice to further consideration of the concept, FRA finds nothingin this proposal that should delay implementation of random testing. <T3>Medical testing.</T3> The Board also recommends that FRA require periodicmedical examinations (``return-to-work, return-from-furlough, and othersas appropriate'') for all employees in safety-sensitive functions and thatFRA require inclusion of alcohol and drug screening in those exams. Here the Board echos the sense of FRA's 1984 recommendation to the railroads(49 FR 24252, 24297; June 12, 1984) that drug tests be included with physicalexaminations. All major railroads have medical examination programs andthere is considerable merit to inclusion of drug screens, particularlyin a return-to-work context. FRA reserves the issue of whether these screensshould be required for a later date. Of the seven rail systems that dominaterail transportation in this country (Conrail, CSX, Norfolk Southern, UnionPacific, Burlington Northern, Southern Pacific, Santa Fe), five alreadyconduct drug or drug/alcohol screens with their physical examinations,although one or more of these railroads may be barred from continuing itsprogram as a result of union-brought litigation. The National RailroadPassenger Corporation (Amtrak) also conducts such testing. The uniformexperience of the railroads that have implemented medical testing is thatit is important and useful, but not by any means dispositive of the problem,since abusers are often able to abstain for the time necessary to avoiddetection. In short, it is not an alternative to random testing or otherforms of short-notice testing. <T3>Monitor performance.</T3> The NTSB also recommends that FRA ``requirerailroads to monitor relevant behavior and performance, such as work attendance,work habits, and motor vehicle driving records, of all employees in safety-sensitivepositions and to recommend to counseling those employees whose [records]are consistent with possible substance abuse.'' FRA, of course, alreadyrequires programs of training and testing in operating rules compliance(49 CFR Part 217) which monitor the most critical facets of performanceon the job. FRA recommended that the railroads implement measures to reviewpersonnel records in 1984 (49 FR 24297; June 12, 1984). The Board itselfquoted in the Alcohol/Drug Study from the FRA Alcohol/Drug Field Manualunit addressed at indentification of drug abuse patterns. Further, theDepartment of Transportation proposed legislation, which was signed intolaw during the comment period, to permit efficient access to the NationalDriver Register. There is no difference in objectives, therefore, betweenthe Board and FRA. However, FRA is concerned that the recommendation, in effect, asks thatFRA mandate and enforce good personnel management. Although certain concretesteps can be required and compliance monitored (e.g., periodic checkingof driving records), efficient and effective personnel management is muchtoo broad and diverse a topic to cover in any set of regulatory requirements;and neither the Board nor FRA can point to a single approach that is validatedas a definitive response to substance abuse in the workplace. Railroads already have significant incentives to manage their personnelwisely, and it is not clear that a new layer of Federal regulations wouldadvance the process. This is an issue appropriate for inclusion in systemassessments of railroad performance. However, one should not proceed withthe illusion that better management by itself can bring an end to substanceabuse in the workplace, since, absent direct and effective countermeasures,it is likely to persist at unacceptable levels in the face of the bestpersonnel practices currently available. <T3>Training. </T3>The Board would require annual drug and alcohol detectiontraining for all employees who are required to monitor fitness for dutyof other railroad employees, including working supervisors such as conductorsand yardmasters. The existing FRA rule already requires that supervisorsempowered to order reasonable cause drug tests receive detection training,and the Board documents in its report the delivery of such training tobroad categories of line supervision under the current FRA rule and railroadprograms, as well as inclusion of education/awareness components in OperationRed Block and similar voluntary programs that FRA has sponsored and supported.It is very clear, however, that detection training is not a substitutefor random testing. Testimony offered at the field hearings supported theconclusion that many drugs in vogue in the railroad workplace can impairthe fitness of a crewmember without inducing symptoms recognizable to evenan educated layman. The fact that testing is keyed to an imperfect abilityto recognize symptoms is one of the fundamental limitations of reasonablesuspicion testing. While the considerable detection training conductedin this industry since 1985 has moderated that limitation to some extent,it cannot diminish it to an acceptable degree. <T3>Reasonable cause testing. </T3>The Board's proposals for reasonablecause testing are as follows: andbullet; Require that railroads adopt mandatory reasonable cause testingprograms for all employees in safety-sensitive positions; andbullet; Expand the circumstances which will trigger reasonable cause testingto include any violation of any safety or operating rule which can compromisethe safety of operations or the welfare of other employees; andbullet; Add testing requirements related to ``work attendance, work habits,and poor motor vehicle driving records.'' andbullet; Require alcohol breath testing in addition to urine testing whenany reasonable cause condition is met.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">FRA appreciates that these recommendations involve matters of seriousrelevance to the current rulemaking. However, FRA does not find them asuitable alternative to random drug testing for the following reasons:Certain of the recommendations are more clearly sound in concept than inpractical application. For instance, broadening the type of operating ruleviolations that would warrant testing would have to be done incrementally.It is not possible to allow discretion to the railroad officer in the fieldto determine when a particular event is sufficiently serious as a safetymatter to require testing; nor, clearly, would violation of many operatingrules warrant such action. For example, operating rules typically includesuch general provisions as prohibiting ``reading of other than Companyinstructions while performing service.'' No doubt inattention caused byreading the morning paper could be a safety problem, but perusing it whilestopped on a siding for a half hour waiting for another train to approachand pass might be less than a critical matter. The point is that allowingdiscretion in application of literally hundreds of pages of rules and instructionsincorporated therein by reference would simply provide a license for exerciseof unchecked discretion. FRA notes that since implementation of the currentrule in February of 1986 no party including the Board has proposed anyspecific operating rules that should be added to the current enumeratedlist. Similarly, consideration of a long term declines in job performanceis obviously relevant to safety, but it is critical to establish linkagebetween those indicators and drug use before ordering drug testing or othermeasures. This is a task well suited to medical or employee assistancepersonnel under existing referral policies of the railroads. FRA notes that the formal NTSB recommendation for mandatory reasonablecause testing comes at a time when all but one of the major rail systemsin the United States have in place reasonably aggressive or very aggressivefor-cause urine testing programs, either under the FRA rule or their owncorporate policies. It is doubtful that railroad managements need furtherencouragement to do what it is clearly in their interest to undertake.Further, a mandate for reasonable cause testing would be largely unenforceable,particularly where no documented accident or injury occurred. In the railroadenvironment, there are normally two parties to any observed situation ofreasonable cause. One is the employee, the other is the railroad officer.If the railroad officer fails to test, the employee who gave reasonablecause certainly has no incentive to report himself. Experience suggeststhat fellow workers who might witness the incident are equally unlikelyto report it. Random testing, by contrast, is fully enforceable. <T3>The NTSB and random testing. </T3>The Board's comments for the docketof this rulemaking reflect its conclusions and recommendations in the Alcohol/DrugStudy. The Board recommends_andbullet; ``Aggressive reasonable cause testing, triggered by a wide rangeof potentially safety-related errors or work behavior patterns;andbullet; ``Post-accident/incident testing (with the definitions of ``accident''and ``incident'' broadened as described in the enclosed Safety Study);andbullet; ``Periodic (medical) testing;andbullet; ``Effective supervision of employees, provided by supervisorsand management better trained to detect and deal effectively with drugand alcohol use; [and]andbullet; ``Competent drug/alcohol education and treatment for employees.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Board advocates implementation of these measures prior to considerationof random testing. Whether the Board supports or opposes random testingremains unclear. FRA believes that some of the Board's recommendations duplicate existingmeasures already implemented on a voluntary basis, while others are impracticalor unwise when cast as Federal regulatory mandates. FRA notes that theAlcohol/Drug Study deals with random testing in a very summary fashion,concluding without significant analysis that other recommended measures,taken together, would be more effective. FRA simply disagrees with thisconclusion, and the testimony of those who chose to appear at the hearingsfailed to support it. This not the time to exhaust the resources of therail industry or the oversight capacity of the FRA chipping away at theperiphery of the problem. This is not the occasion, after over a decadeof experimentation, to attempt methods that are unnecessarily intrusive,untried, or uncertain of administration. What is required is a clear andeffective deterrent, utilizing means that will detect those incapable ofchanging their behaviors. Random testing will provide that deterrent anddetection capability. Small Railroad Issues<T3>Comments: </T3>FRA received numerous comments on the issue of whethersmall railroads should be excluded from the requirements of the rule. TheAmerican Short Line Railroad Association (ASLRA) and a good number of itsmembers stated that the unique nature of the small carrier warrants exclusion,while many of the Class I carriers stated that because some small carriersoperate on the same tracks as larger roads they should be equally drugfree. The ASLRA proposed that carriers with fifteen or fewer covered employeesbe exempted. One carrier suggested that the cut-off point be carriers with31,200 or fewer manhours by covered employees annually. Another suggestedthat the FRA exempt carriers based upon operating speed. Many comments were received on the special nature of the small short linerailroad:1. Small railroads generally operate on special, dedicated trackage whichis not part of the national trunk line system. They do not share this trackagewith other carriers. 2. In nearly three years of FRA post-accident testing, there has not beena single drug or alcohol positive on a carrier in this classification.3. Typically only one train operates on the line at any time, eliminatingthe possibility of a collision-type accident, the type of occurrence whichcorrelates to many of the human performance decrements produced by drugimpairment. 4. Managers often perform covered service, and therefore the regulationwould create an anomaly whereby the manager would be administering testingon himself or herself. 5. Employees of small railroads are closely supervised and do not stayovernight at remote locations. Thus, two important root causes of druguse among rail employees are not present. 6. Small roads operate at low speed (typically no more than 25 mph) inrural locations and do not transport passengers. Hazardous materials trafficvolumes are low. 7. The cost of a program to the small operator is disproportionately high.The economic burden of a sophisticated program could bankrupt unstablefledgling companies or force tradeoffs against safety investments thatwould be more effective in their unique circumstances. However, commenters distinguished the cases in which a small road operatesconcurrently with a large carrier on shared track. All commenters agreedthat the potential for a serious accident exists in that situation andthat carriers operating on shared trackage should be subject to the sametesting requirements as all other carriers operating on the national trunkline system. Comments were also received discussing how the FRA should tailor the requirementof random testing to meet the concerns of the small carrier. It was suggestedby large and small carriers alike that the FRA establish a hardship exclusion,whereby the FRA could excuse a carrier from compliance pursuant to thedetermination that a testing program is not necessary, or would be overlyburdensome. Three small carriers proposed that the FRA itself conduct testingof short lines. This would save the railroads from having to bear the costof drafting and implementing a program of their own. One commenter suggestedthat if testing is required, the FRA should excuse the small road fromreporting requirements in order to preserve anonymity. Due to the economic burden which random testing may place on small roads,much comment was received on ways to help small operators defray the costof testing. One approach is for small railroads to ``piggyback'' onto theprogram of a Class I carrier. The large operator would in effect administerthe program on a compensated basis for the small carrier. Some small carriersgave qualified assent to such arrangements, while several Class I carriersexpressed strong opposition. Larger railroads fear possible liability consequences.They are also reluctant to be strapped with responsibility for trackingdown short line employees or administering their programs. Some small railroadsalso feared the loss of control over personnel that would result if largerrailroads administered the selection process. The FRA received comments on the feasibility of lowering costs throughthe use of multi-carrier agreements. Under this approach, short lines couldjoin together and establish a single program which would do the testingfor several railroads. The ASLRA stated, however, that past attempts atcollective arrangements indicate that short lines are reluctant to relinquishcontrol of their operations and that therefore programs of this sort wouldmost likely enjoy very limited support.<T3>Conclusions: </T3>As FRA has explained in previous rulemakings, verysmall railroads present a unique regulatory problem. They are fundamentallydifferent from small entities in other modes for several reasons. Mostof these entities operate over track that is devoted exclusively to theirservice. It is not part of the national trunk line system. Because theyare involved in the ``retail'' service of picking up or setting out carsat points of origin or destination, they move smaller trains, often withlower-horsepower locomotives. Operating speeds are generally in the 10mile per hour range. Because most small railroads operate only a singletrain, collision-type accidents are impossible. Hazardous materials trafficis light, and operating speeds ordinarily do not produce the kinetic energynecessary to cause a major hazardous materials release. Small railroadsdo not provide scheduled passenger service, and their total employmentconstitutes less than 1 percent of the industry. The special problems of small railroads with 15 or fewer Hours of Serviceemployees, and the reduced safety exposure they represent, have compelledthe Congress to allow exemptions to the traditional restrictions on Hoursof Service applicable to all other railroads. Their problems are recognizedin other ways in Federal safety standards, including exclusion from certainreporting requirements and exclusion of certain low-speed track (in commonwith other railroads) from the Track Safety Standards. When FRA issuedthe current alcohol/drug regulations in 1985, the very small railroadswere also excluded from requirements for pre-employment drug testing, fromthe reasonable cause testing authorization, and from ``bypass'' requirements.FRA did make very small railroads subject to requirements for post-accidenttoxicological testing, as well as the prohibitions of andSection; 219.101(``Federal Rule G''). However, since the institution of these requirementsnot a single small railroad has had an accident sufficiently severe toqualify under the mandatory post-accident testing requirements. Nor dowe have any other information indicating public safety consequences fromdrug use on very small railroads. FRA agrees that imposition of mandatory random testing on very small railroadsis unnecessary and inappropriate. Although small railroads can certainlyhave accidents, they have few accidents that involve hazard to personsoff their rights-of-way. As a consequence, the final rule exempts railroadswith 15 or fewer employees from the random testing requirement. However,this exemption does not apply where the small railroad has trackage rightsover another railroad or otherwise engages in joint operations with anotherrailroad. FRA believes that the criterion of 15 or fewer Hours of Service employeesshould, as a time-honored distinction embodied in the Hours of ServiceAct, serve as the line of delineation between those railroads subject tothe random testing requirement and those not subject. This threshold isclearly in the range of reasonableness as a distinction between very localand limited rail operations and somewhat more extensive operations involvinggreater potential hazards. FRA recognizes that small railroads above the exemption limit will requireassistance to develop and implement random testing programs. FRA believesthat the combination of concerted action through the ASLRA, FRA assistance,contracts with larger railroads, consortia among smaller railroads, andother approaches yet to be devised will permit orderly implementation ofrandom testing on these properties. Similarly, very small railroads thatoperate over other railroads should be able to make reasonable arrangementsfor testing services from the host railroad or from other sources. FRAhas considered but decided against mandating the participation of largerrailroads in these arrangements, believing that workable solutions canonly be fashioned on a business basis without FRA involvement. Alcohol<T3>Comments: </T3>Safe Travel America and six railroads would extend therandom testing mandate to include alcohol. Commenters favoring inclusionof alcohol noted that alcohol is the single most abused drug in our societyand feared that testing for other drugs alone could cause abusers to usealcohol instead. United Transportation Union witnesses viewed alcohol asa problem six or seven times greater than abuse of other drugs. The AAR and certain other commenters believed that alcohol is more easilydetected than use of other drugs. It was noted that testing for job-relateduse of alcohol would require blood or breath sampling, with attendant logisticalcomplications. <T3>Conclusions: </T3>Random testing for alcohol is a proposal that istechnically beyond the scope of the NPRM. FRA did not include random testingfor alcohol in the NPRM because it appeared that existing countermeasures,including the reasonable cause testing program, have been effective inreducing the use of alcohol by employees. Since post-accident toxicologicaltesting began in early 1986, the positive rate for alcohol has remainedat or below one percent. In one 7-year period prior to the issuance ofthe current rule, significant alcohol presence was determined in aboutone of every six or seven employees killed on the job in train incidents.In the two and one-half years since the effective date of the current rule,the only employee fatalities in train incidents for which alcohol has beendetected are three non-Hours of Service employees (i.e., employees notsubject to the current rule). Further, FRA had noted that testing for alcohol presents separate issuesthat require independent analysis. It is not possible to test a singleurine specimen and determine current blood alcohol concentration. Breathtesting is the preferred method of detection and evaluation, but clearlywould involve a separate logistical structure to administer in a randommanner.Accordingly, FRA has determined that the alcohol issue should continueto be addressed through existing programs, without prejudice to the possibilityof further regulatory action at a later time.Preemption<T3>Comments:</T3> Comments were received indicating that some states haveenacted laws which limit or regulate drug testing by private employers.In order to comply with these state requirements a railroad may have tovary the nature of its testing program from state to state. Two operatorsand the EEAC request that the FRA indicate in the final rule that statelaws concerning drug testing are preempted by the federal mandate.The RLEA commented that the final rule should also supersede any currentor future random testing programs which are not implemented under the authorityof the FRA rule.<T3>Conclusions:</T3> Section 205 of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of1970 provides, in effect, that state and local laws and regulations arepreempted by any Safety Act regulation addressing the same subject matter.This statutory preemption is restated in the current regulation, whichthis final rule amends. Therefore, issuance of this random testing rulewill preempt any state legislation regarding random drug testing for railroademployees, whether or not inconsistent with the final rule. FRA understandsthe scope of preemption to be as broad as necessary to ensure uniformity,both with respect to the occasions on which testing may be required andthe technical safeguards for that testing.Penalties<T3>Comments:</T3> The FRA received a number of comments alleging abusesof present drug testing programs. Several union organizations, concernedthat random testing may be misused by some members of railroad management,urged the FRA to provide harassed or mistreated employees with specificremedies. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers asked for a $5,000 penaltyfor harassment, defined as a willful violation of the regulations. Onerailroad believed that railroads should be excused if, during the firstyear, the testing target was not met. Other comments were beyond the scopeof the notice.<T3>Conclusions:</T3> FRA has updated the penalty schedule to reflect thehigher levels of penalties allowed under the Rail Safety Improvement Actof 1988. Additional revisions may be made in the context of the pendingreview of all penalty schedules (53 FR 28594; July 28, 1988).International CommerceIt has been determined not to make the random testing requirement applicablein any situation where compliance would violate the domestic laws or policiesof another country. In addition, because of the potential confusion thatmay exist involving application of this rule in situations where compliancecould violate foreign laws or policies, we have determined not to makethe rule applicable, until January 1, 1990, in any situation where a foreigngovernment contends that compliance with our rule raises questions of compatibilitywith its domestic laws or policies. During the next year, the Departmentof Transportation and other U.S. Government officials will be working closelywith representatives of foreign governments with the goal of reaching apermanent resolution to any conflict between our rule and foreign lawsand policies. The U.S. and Canadian Governments have already establisheda bilateral working group in an attempt to achieve this objective. We believethat considerable progress has already been made, and further meetingswill be held in the near future. While we believe that this can be a modelfor addressing the concerns of other countries, it is not intended to bethe exclusive means. The Administrator may delay the effective date furtherunder this section, if such delay is necessary to permit consultation withany foreign governments to be successfully completed.It is the agency's intention to issue a notice no later than December 1,1989 that would make any necessary amendments to the rule as a result ofdiscussions with foreign governments. Shortly after their issuance, anysuch notices will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. While we recognize that any decision not toapply our rule to foreign citizens has the potential to create some anomalousconditions in competitive situations, it is the intention of the U.S. Governmentto make every effort to resolve potential conflicts with foreign governmentsin a manner that accommodates their concerns while ensuring the necessarylevel of safety by those we regulate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section-by-Section Analysis of Final Rule</ITAG>The final rule reflects substantial revisions as a result of comments received,issues raised during the exchanges at the public hearings, and furtherreview within FRA. Each comment received has been considered by the FRAin preparing this final rule.Amendments to Part 219The final rule amends the existing alcohol/drug control rule (49 CFR Part219) by adding a prohibition on non-medical use of controlled substancesat any time, creating a new subpart requiring submission and implementationof random drug testing programs, adding a new subpart that sets forth rigorousconditions and safeguards for urine drug testing authorized or requiredunder the part, and making conforming changes in the general subpart. Asnoted below, further amendments will be issued in this same proceedingto conform Subparts D and F to the new Subpart H and revise Subpart C toincorporate enhanced procedures similar to those contained in Subpart H.<T3>Subpart A amendments</T3><T3>Section 219.3</T3> is amended to exclude from the operation of SubpartG (random testing) any person for whom compliance would violate the domesticlaws or policies of another country.<T3>Section 219.9 </T3>is amended to place the responsibility for compliancewith random testing and testing safeguards on the railroad. Paragraph (d)of andSection; 219.9, added by a recent amendment (53 FR 28594, 28600; July28, 1988), imposes responsibility for compliance on individuals with respectto any applicable provisions and makes individuals subject to penalty forwillful violations.<T3>Subpart B amendment. </T3>The final rule amends Subpart B by addinga new andSection; 219.102, entitled ``Prohibition on use of controlled substances.''The rule expressly states the proposition that an employee who performscovered service ay not use a controlled substance at any time, except aspermitted by andSection; 219.103. Section 219.103 allows use of a controlledsubstance under medical authorization where the medical practitioner hasmade a good faith judgment, with notice of the employee's assigned dutiesand on the basis of available medical history, that use of the substanceby the employee at the prescribed or authorized dosage level is consistentwith the safe performance of the employee's duties.The purpose of this prohibition is to promote the fitness of employeesengaged in safety-sensitive functions and thereby to promote public andemployee safety on the railroad. The prohibition is stated broadly to encourageresponsible use of controlled substances and to put the employee on noticethat detection of residues of controlled substances may have adverse consequences.Without proper medical guidance, employees may use controlled substancesthat have terminal half-lives of many hours or even days without beingaware of the potential for adverse consequences on the job. Further, withoutsuch guidance, employees may cease to use drugs precipitously, resultingin withdrawal or hangover effects that can also degrade performance.The rule neither authorizes nor requires surveillance by the railroad orany other person of off-duty conduct. Rather, the rule establishes a standardof conduct to guide the covered employee.<T3>Subpart G. </T3>The final rule adds a new Subpart G to Part 219. Thesubpart requires establishment of random testing programs.<T3>Section 219.601 </T3>deals with content and approval of random testingprograms. <T3>Paragraph (a) </T3>requires each railroad to submit a random testingprogram for approval by the Administrator not later than June 19, 1989.Subsequent amendments would also be reviewed prior to implementation.<T3>Paragraph (b) </T3>requires random testing programs to meet certaincriteria. First, they must provide for statistically random selection ofemployees. In order to allow for rounding errors associated with multi-stageselection processes, the rule provides that each employee must have a ``substantiallyequal'' statistical chance of selection within a specified time frame.Any exercise of discretion in selection is specifically prohibited.Second, programs must select for testing a sufficient number of employeesso that the annualized rate of testing is equal to 50 percent of the relevantworkforce. (Selection of a greater number of employees than are actuallytested is a common feature of random testing programs, since at any giventime some employees will be unavailable for testing due to use of annualor sick leave, training away from the normal work site, etc. The railroadprogram should address precisely how these problems will be addressed.)The final rule also makes allowance for gradual start-up of the program.For some employers, particularly those with a large number of employeessubject to drug testing, it may be a substantial burden to move immediatelyto a 50 percent random testing rate. If required to have tested at a rateequal to 50 percent of all covered employees by the end of the first year,employers might have to test at rates far above 50 percent toward the endof the year, to make up for lower rates at the beginning. Employers shouldbe permitted to start out at a lower testing rate and work up to 50 percentas experience is gained and the testing procedure becomes administrativelymore routine. Clearly, it would not be wise to create a situation whichmight lead to mistakes by requiring initial testing at too high a rate.The final rule therefore provides an implementation procedure that wouldallow employers to phase in random drug testing during the first 12 monthsin which tests are conducted. Employers would not be required to reachan annualized rate of 50 percent until the last test collection. The testswould have to be spaced reasonably through the year to permit the employerto phase in to the 50 percent rate, and the total number of tests conductedwould have to be equal to at least 25 percent of the covered population.Suppose, for example, that a railroad has 1,000 covered employees. At a50 percent annual rate, 500 tests would have to be conducted during a year.Under the phase-in, however, the employer could conduct only a few drugtests at the beginning of the program and then gradually increase the numberof tests until, by the end of the first year, the annualized rate of 50was achieved. Thus, if the railroad's random testing program contemplatedadministering random tests on 12 occasions during the year, the employerwould need to administer at least 42 tests (500 divided by 12) on the lastoccasion, but could administer fewer tests until then. Overall, the employerwould have to conduct at least 250 random tests the first year. In subsequentyears, the 50 percent rate would be maintained.Third, the programs must meet certain criteria to ensure effectiveness.The program must be structured so that each employee perceives the possibilitythat he or she will be subject to testing. For example, the program mustsample employees who regularly work late night and early morning shifts,not just employees on day shifts. Pool crews and extra board employeesshould also be subject to selection and testing on a basis that createsan expectation that selection may occur under circumstances where the employeeis available for testing. Notice of selection shall not be provided untilthe duty tour during which testing occurs and then only so far in advanceof collection as is necessary. Testing procedures and safeguards must beconsistent with the requirements of Part 219.Fourth, random testing programs must provide that an employee shall besubject to testing only while on duty. Employees who are off duty may notbe notified that testing is required. Although the rule does not bar callingemployees to duty exclusively for the purpose of testing if they are availablefor service under the collective bargaining agreement, they may not benotified of the testing requirement until they have reported. Since itis in the mutual interest of employees and railroads to provide for testingin connection with regular duty tours, FRA believes that random testingprograms will be so designed as to create the minimum impact on employees'lives and therefore minimum cost to the railroad.Finally, programs must provide that employees selected on a random basisbe so informed. FRA anticipates that this would be done through initialverbal notification and through a check-off on the urine custody and controlform.<T3>Paragraph (c) </T3>provides for approval or disapproval (and resubmission)of random testing programs.<T3>Paragraph (d) </T3>requires implementation of approved programs notlater than November 20, 1989. Prior to implementation, each covered employeemust receive a notice announcing the forthcoming commencement of the program,the consequences of a determination that the employee has violated andSection;219.102 or any applicable railroad rule, and reminding the employee ofthe right to self-refer for counseling and treatment without adverse consequences.The notice is intended to encourage affected employees to cease using drugsprior to the implementation of random testing. <T3>Section 219.603 </T3>requires participation in random testing and prescribesa 9-month disqualification from covered service for refusing to providea sample. This period is similar to the period set forth for refusal ofa post-accident test, and hearing procedures are likewise similar. Thesection clarifies that tampering by the donor is a refusal. The requirementthat the employee be disqualified from covered service is one that operatesagainst the railroad (including a subsequent employer with notice of therefusal) and is issued under the Secretary's general regulatory authorityconferred by section 202 of the Federal Railroad Safety Act. Followingthe end of the 9-month period, the disqualified employee could be returnedto work only after presenting a negative sample and would be subject tofollow-up testing. The employee would also have to complete any programof rehabilitation deemed necessary after professional evaluation. <T3>Section 219.605 </T3>deals with consequences of a test result. <T3>Paragraph (a) </T3>recites that a test result is not considered positiveuntil confirmed and reviewed by a medical review officer. <T3>Paragraph (b) </T3>provides for notification to the employee. <T3>Paragraph (c) </T3>requires the railroad to suspend from covered servicean employee who is believed to be in violation of andSection; 219.102 asa result of a positive test result. <T3>Paragraph (d) </T3>preserves any procedural rights available to theemployee under a collective bargaining agreement or at common law. Mostrailroad employees are subject to specific procedural rights under thecollective bargaining agreements with respect to lodging of a rule charge,investigation, grievance and arbitration. It is FRA's intent that thismechanism continue to be used to resolve issues of compliance by the employeewith Federal and railroad alcohol/drug rules. For instance, should a railroadinvestigating officer or arbitrator determine, after hearing, that theemployee had not been shown to be in noncompliance with andSection; 219.102or a railroad rule, the deciding officer could reinstate the employee withfull back pay and benefits. This is the same system currently being usedto determine employee responsibility under existing regulations. <T3>Paragraph (e) </T3>provides that an employee who has been determinedto have violated andSection; 219.102 may not be returned to service unlessthe employee has presented a negative urine sample, been evaluated forchemical dependency or other treatable disorder, and completed any courseof counseling or treatment determined to be necessary by an EAP counselor(a term defined in andSection; 219.5). The determination referred to is thedetermination of the railroad (which is ordinarily subject to review andmodification by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction). Thisparagraph does not require that the employee be provided an opportunityfor treatment, nor does it bar disciplinary sanctions. It merely establishesa safety ``floor'' for return of the recovering substance abuser to coveredservice. Upon return to service, the employee is subject to the requirementof participation in aftercare, if required by the EAP counselor, and toa reasonable program of follow-up testing not more than 60 months in duration.These provisions will allow the exercise of sound professional judgmentby substance abuse and medical professionals and do not provide licensefor pursuit of collateral agendas. <T3>Section 219.607 </T3>provides for record retention. Detailed recordsfor positive tests must be retained for at least 2 years in order to ensuretheir availability to FRA and arbitrators (as necessary). Records of negativetests must be retained for 1 year. Summary records of test results andemployee rehabilitation must be retained for at least 5 years. These recordsmust be maintained for a reasonable period, by employee, if adequate datais to be gathered with respect to the success of drug abuse treatment.<T3>Section 219.609 </T3>excludes from the subpart a railroad that employsnot more than 15 Hours of Service employees and that does not operate onthe tracks of another operating railroad. The exclusion does apply to asmall railroad that leases track from another railroad, so long as thesmall railroad is the exclusive operator. FRA recognizes that this sectiondoes not precisely parallel the application language of andSection; 219.3(b).FRA will resolve this tension in a forthcoming rulemaking. <T3>Subpart H. </T3>The final rule adds a new Subpart H, which providesenhanced testing standards for existing Subparts D and F, as well as thenew random testing subparts. This subpart becomes fully effective on July19, 1989. This will allow time for HHS to complete its certification oflaboratories, for railroads to make additional arrangements for collectionand enter into new contracts for laboratory services, and for other necessarysteps to be implemented. Earlier compliance is, of course, consistent withcurrent regulations. Subpart H will function in tandem with the Procedures for TransportationWorkplace Drug Testing Programs, 49 CFR Part 40, which is published elsewherein today's <T4>Federal Register. </T4>This part will, in effect, codify the HHS Guidelineswith adaptations for DOT-regulated parties. Through incorporation by reference,Subpart H makes the DOT Procedures mandatory on railroad employers withrespect to reasonable cause testing, pre-employment drug testing, and randomtesting. In the case of any perceived conflict of interpretation betweenPart 219 and Part 40, Part 219 controls because of its more particularapplication. <T3>Section 219.701(a) </T3>gives effect to the DOT Procedures and appliesthem and Subpart H to Subparts D, F and G. For emphasis, the provisionnotes that only HHS-certified laboratories may be employed for this testing.<T3>Paragraph (b) </T3>requires that the railroads' contracts with certifiedlaboratories provide for appropriate inspection rights. The purpose ofinspection as specified here is continuing laboratory quality control.<T3>Paragraph (c) </T3>requires that labaratory contracts also providefor the laboratory's compliance with this part, including the laboratorystandards provisions of the HHS Guidelines. It should be noted that the DOT Procedures contain special provisions relievingsmaller employers of blind proficiency testing requirements where the employeruses a laboratory already subject to blind proficiency testing by a transportationemployer or Federal agency. Railroads covered by the blind testing requirementemploy the great majority of employees subject to Part 219 and will submitto certified laboratories large volumes of employee samples and blind proficiencytesting samples. Requiring this of smaller railroads would have littlemarginal effect with respect to quality control of the laboratories butwould involve considerable expense and administrative burden. Further,involving a proliferation of smaller businesses in a blind proficiencytesting program at this juncture in the development of the art would createunacceptable risks that samples could be mishandled and lead to confusionover the meaning of proficiency testing results. Although laboratory capacityfor drug urinalysis is more than adequate, the number of firms providingexpert external quality control services is presently limited. It is moreimportant that large volume programs challenge the laboratories properlythan it is for a large number of small clients to submit a relative handfulof blind samples. <T3>Section 219.703 </T3>deals with collection of urine samples. <T3>Paragraph (a) </T3>provides that collection shall be handled in accordancewith 49 CFR Part 40, the adapted HHS Guidelines.<T3>Paragraph (b) </T3>refers to the policy of the DOT Procedures, whichrecognizes two groups of qualified collectors. The first is licensed medicalprofessionals and technicians. Medical personnel may conduct collectionsif they have received instructions for collection under Part 40 and ifthey conduct the collection and certify its completion as required in thatPart. Medical personnel are an essential resource for collection of urinesamples following injury-producing events, where the employee has the optionto provide a blood sample (as is the case under Subpart D), and in remoterural locations. Further, many railroads will wish to use independent medicalfacilities for collections (even when not required) in order to providereassurance to employees that the process is fair and unbiased. Medicalpersonnel are familiar with basic procedures for collection, identificationand handling of body fluids used for diagnostic purposes. The adapted Guidelinesset forth supplementary procedures that guard against intentional tamperingby the donor while ensuring that the specimen is properly secured and handledin accordance with chain-of-custody procedures. Medical personnel mustbe provided written instructions ensuring that those procedures are followed.Other personnel may also be trained to collect a urine specimen in accordancewith the adapted Guidelines.<T3>Paragraph (c) </T3>bars use of supervisors and co-workers as collectors.Collection should be accomplished in a detached and professional manner.Employees should not be subject to collection by persons with whom theywork in the railroad operating environment. The term ``co-worker'' is definedfor purposes of the paragraph to mean a person with whom the employee isassigned or could be assigned in a crew or other working unit to performnormal transportation duties on the railroad. FRA is aware that this limitationmay make it difficult for smaller railroads to provide for collection onrailroad property using their own personnel as collectors. However, FRAbelieves that smaller railroads will be able to use commercial collectionservices and local medical personnel to accomplish the collections.<T3>Section 219.705 </T3>deals with the range of controlled substancesfor which testing is conducted. <T3>Paragraph (a)</T3> provides that samples shall be analyzed for controlledsubstances identified in paragraph (b). Under the DOT Procedures, testingis also authorized for specific gravity, creatinine (a natural waste presentin all urine) concentration, and for suspected adulterants such as soap,vinegar or other agents that might be introduced in an attempt to defeata screening test. These preparatory steps do not involve determinationof any information that would be reported by a laboratory to any otherperson, unless the sample was deemed not suitable for analysis.<T3>Paragraph (b) </T3>requires that each sample be analyzed for marijuana,cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), opiates (morphine and codeine), and amphetamines(amphetamine and methamphetamine). Obviously, in the case of certain ofthese drugs it is the metabolite of the drug that is the target compound.The five drug groups identified in this section generally represent themost widely abused controlled substances. Even in the case of PCP, forwhich the prevalence rate among employed populations is very low, thereis an important public safety interest in identifying the few employeeswho may use the drug, since it is capable of producing lasting and extrememental disorders, as well as irrational and uncontrolled conduct duringits period of acute activity. Inexpensive screening tests are availablefor each of the drug groups.<T3>Paragraph (c) </T3>provides that a railroad may test the sample obtainedunder this rule only for the drugs required or specifically authorizedto be tested under this rule. (Part 40 further emphasizes that testingof the specimen other than that specifically authorized or required isprohibited.) That is, a railroad must test the sample for the five majordrugs listed in each DOT regulation. Only if, in the context of reasonablecause testing, the FRA authorizes testing for additional Drug X under 49CFR Part 40 (an approval which would be granted only after consultationwith the Department of Health and Human Services, and only on the basisof an HHS-established testing protocol and positive threshold) may therailroad also test the sample for that drug.Absent such an approval, if the employer wants to test, in addition, forDrug Y, the employer must obtain a second sample from the employee. Theobtaining of this second sample is not under the authority of any DOT regulation.The employer must base its request for the second sample on whatever otherlegal authority is available, since the employer cannot rely on the DOTregulation as the basis for the request.<T3>Section 219.707</T3> provides for review of test results by the railroad'smedical review officer (MRO) under provisions of 49 CFR Part 40. UnderPart 40, test results are reported exclusively to the MRO, and only afterperformance of the confirmatory test.Under <T3>paragraph (a) </T3>and Part 40, the MRO has the responsibility to reviewthe laboratory report and consider alternate explanations for the presenceof the compound detected, such as medical use of the controlled substance.<T3>Paragraph (b) </T3>requires the MRO to complete review of the testresults in not more than 10 working days, unless additional time is requiredbecause the MRO is awaiting supplementary documentation from the employee.<T3>Paragraph (c) </T3>requires prompt delivery of any positive reportto the employee. In no case may a railroad take adverse action againstthe employee without providing the employee a copy of the test result.<T3>Paragraph (d) </T3>provides that the MRO shall report all negativeresults, including analytical positives indicating medical use of controlledsubstances and tests for which laboratory data is deemed insufficient,over the MRO's signature. The intent of this provision is for there tobe a single form of negative report that does not disclose the basis onwhich the result is considered negative. The paragraph bars disseminationof medical drug use information to non-medical personnel, whether the informationis derived from a test result or information provided by the employee orthe employee's physician. The medical review officer is not barred fromusing therapeutic drug use information in the context of an establishedmedical qualifications program, since enforcement of such a bar would inappropriatelyinject FRA into a confidential relationship and create major problems ofenforcement. Where such programs exist, as they have with respect to railroadsof significant size for many decades, the employee waives normal privacyinterests with respect to matters bearing on medical fitness for duty.<T3>Section 219.709 </T3>addresses sample retention and retesting. <T3>Paragraph (a) </T3>provides for retention of samples deemed positiveon confirmation for a one-year period. Within this period the employeemay request that the sample be retained for a further reasonable period.<T3>Paragraph (b) </T3>creates a right to have the original sample retestedif the employee makes the request within 60 days of receipt of a positivetest result from the MRO. The employee may designate retesting by the originallaboratory or another HHS certified laboratory. The railroad may requirethe employee to advance the cost of reanalysis, subject to reimbursementif the retest is negative. <T3>Paragraph (c) </T3>provides that inter-laboratory transfers be handledin accordance with chain-of-custody procedures. <T3>Paragraph (d) </T3>provides that retest results shall be reported downto the level of sensitivity of the assay. Some drugs and metabolites deteriorateduring handling and storage, therefore use of the same cut-offs employedfor original testing is not appropriate. <T3>Section 219.711 </T3>requires that test results be held in confidence.<T3>Paragraph (a) </T3>restricts handling of test results by laboratories.This paragraph must be effectuated through the railroad's contract withthe laboratory (<T3>see </T3>andSection; 219.701(c)). <T3>Paragraph (b) </T3>provides that test results may be used within therailroad only for the purpose of compliance with Part 219. No further disseminationmay be made within or external to the railroad, except with the writtenvoluntary consent of the employee. The paragraph also requires that therailroad institute internal procedures sufficient to guard the informationagainst unauthorized disclosure. Compliance with this part would includesuspension of the employee, completion of any disciplinary proceeding requiredto determine compliance with andSection; 219.102 or a similar company rule(including review of the determination by a professional arbitrator), andreferral of the individual to an employee assistance program, if applicable.FRA recognizes that it may be appropriate for future railroad employersof persons testing positive to be aware that the employee has been determinedto have violated andSection; 219.102, particularly where the employee requiresrehabilitation prior to being returned to service or is subject to aftercareor follow-up testing. Railroads can achieve this objective by requestingthe applicant to provide the necessary consent as a condition of employment.Such a consent is voluntary within the meaning of this part. <T3>Paragraph (c) </T3>deals with handling of post-accident test resultsunder Subpart C. Railroads are required to maintain those test resultsin the same manner as provided for other test results, except to the extentthe results are made public in connection with an accident investigation.The section also recites FRA's present policy of treating test resultsindicating medical use of controlled substances as not subject to disclosureexcept where it is necessary to consider the information in relation todetermination of probable cause. The final rule also amends the <T3>Schedule of Civil Penalties, Appendix A, </T3>to provide penaltiesfor violations of the random testing provisions (which incorporate by referenceSubpart H). Other portions of the penalty schedule will be similarly amendedprior to the effective date of Subpart H. Amounts set forth in the scheduleamendments reflect the increased penalty range recently enacted into lawin the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 1988. <T3>Amendment to Part 217 </T3>The final rule also amends andSection; 217.13 (Annual Report) to requirereporting of alcohol/drug tests and observations in a standard format andto require reporting of new data elements related to the random testingprogram. Experience under the existing provision has indicated that therailroads and the FRA share a common need to obtain comparative aggregatedata regarding this subject matter. <ITAG tagnum="84">Further Rulemaking </ITAG>The final rule makes certain changes in the safeguards for urine drug testingconducted under Subparts D and F of the current rule (49 CFR Part 219),effective July 19, 1989. In summary, the provisions of the new SubpartH will displace a number of provisions designed to provide for accurateand well-administered urine drug testing with the state-of-the-art requirementsnow available under the HHS Guidelines, as adapted through the DOT Procedures.Where appropriate, existing text will be removed and cross-references tothe new regulatory language will be inserted. Provisions for mandatorypost-accident toxicological testing will also be updated to incorporateprocedures and further safeguards equivalent to those set forth in theDOT Procedures, which are themselves based on HHS Guidelines issued inApril of 1988 and not yet fully implemented through laboratory certifications.Certain other decisions made in this proceeding will also require conformingchanges in previous regulatory language in order to ensure consistencyand orderly implementation. FRA is publishing this final rule as soon as possible in order to allowthe railroads ample time to plan and implement random testing programs.However, FRA recognizes that a supplemental final rule will have to beissued to make the conforming changes, and certain additional issues willhave to be handled through separate notice and comment. The supplemental final rule will be issued in the very near future, wellahead of the implementation dates announced in this final rule. A supplemental NPRM will also be issued addressing the issues of approvalof testing for other controlled substances, adjustment of random testinglevel of effort in light of experience gained under the rule, and creditingof other short-notice tests to the random testing 50% target level. Additional notices of proposed rulemaking regarding minor substantive changesmay also be issued in the near future. FRA remains committed to makinga significant number of perfecting changes in the existing rule text andwill do so with appropriate opportunity for further public participation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Analysis</ITAG>E.O.12291 and DOT Regulatory Policies and ProceduresThese final regulations have been evaluated in accordance with existingregulatory policies and are considered to be non-major under ExecutiveOrder 12291. However, they are considered to be significant under the DOTpolicies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979) because they initiatea substantial regulatory program.Consequently, FRA has prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket a regulatoryevaluation addressing the economic impact of these rules. It may be inspectedand copied in Room 8201, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.FRA's ``base case'' estimate yields program costs over the first ten yearsof approximately $81 million and direct benefits from reduced train accidentsof more than $87 million (current values at 10 percent discount), resultingin a positive benefit to cost ratio of 1.08 to 1. The favorable ratio wouldbe significantly higher if the rule avoided a major catastrophic accident,such as a hazardous materials accident involving loss of a number of livesand destruction of valuable property.FRA believes that additional direct and indirect benefits will accrue asa result of the deterrence of drug abuse and treatment of those detectedfor the first time. (Railroad policies typically allow reinstatement ofrecovering drug abusers on a leniency basis if they have completed appropriatetreatment.) These benefits will include reduced personal injuries on andoff the job, improved productivity and reduced absenteeism, reduced medicaland worker's compensation claims, theft reduction, and diversion of cashresources of employees from non-productive expenditures for purchase ofdrugs to productive, legitimate uses. Accordingly, the total benefits flowingfrom the rule should preponderate over costs by a significantly higherratio than presented in the quantitative analysis.<T3>Regulatory Flexibility Act</T3>FRA certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. Although a significantnumber of small railroads are subject to these regulations, the economicimpact of the rules will not be significant for several reasons. Althoughunit costs for small railroads for certain services required under theregulations may be somewhat higher, small railroads have the latitude toutilize cooperative buying services and, from testimony received duringthe rulemaking, will find at least some connecting Class I railroads willingto assist in areas such as laboratory contracts. Preparation of randomtesting programs will be facilitated by the small railroads' industry association.Gross testing costs will be generally proportional to the scale of therailroad, since costs vary by number of employees required to be tested.FRA has taken two specific actions that will limit impacts on small entities.First, very small railroads employing 15 or fewer Hours of Service employeeswill be excluded from the requirement for random testing programs if theyare not engaged in joint operations with other railroads. Second, smallerrailroads are excluded from the requirement for blind proficiency testingif they utilize laboratories subject to blind challenge by other Governmentor transportation clients.Comments received on this issue are summarized above.<T3>Paperwork Reduction Act</T3>The rules being adopted in this proceeding contain revised informationcollection requirements in the following sections: andSection;andSection; 219.601,219.603, 219.605, 219.607, 219.701 (incorporating 49 CFR Part 40), 219.705, 219.707, 219.709, 219.711. Revised information collection requirementsare also contained in the amendments to andSection; 217.13. FRA is submittingthese information collection requirements to the Office of Management andBudget for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.3501 et seq.). FRA anticipates that OMB will undertake prompt action onthese requests for approval. When OMB has approved these revised requirements,FRA will publish a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> announcing that action and revising andSection;219.21 accordingly. Compliance with the revised information collectionrequirements is not required until the approvals have been provided. Anycomments on the revised information collection requirements should be providedto Mr. Gary Waxman, Regulatory Policy Branch, Office of Management andBudget, New Executive Office Building, 726 Jackson Place, NW., Washington,DC 20503. Copies of any such comments should be provided to the docketof this rulemaking.<T3>Environmental Impact</T3>FRA has evaluated these regulations in accordance with its procedures forensuring full consideration of the environmental impact of FRA actionsas required by the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 etseq.), other environmental statutes, Executive Orders, and DOT Order 5610.1c.These regulations meet the criteria that establish this as a non-majoraction for environmental purposes.<T3>Federalism Implications</T3>This final rule will not have a substantial effect on the states, on therelationship between the national government and the states, or on thedistribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels ofgovernment. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, preparationof a Federalism assessment is not warranted. Under section 205 of the FederalRailroad Safety Act of 1970, 45 U.S.C. 434, this rule preempts any stateor local law addressing the subject matter of the rule. The Safety Actprovides for uniform regulation of railroads involved in interstate commerce.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG><T3>49 CFR Part 217</T3>Railroad safety, Railroad operating rules, Reporting and recordkeepingactivities.<T3>49 CFR Part 219</T3>Railroad safety, Control of alcohol and drug use, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Urine drug testing standards.In consideration of the foregoing, Chapter II, Subtitle B, of Title 49,Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 219_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

The program shall be submitted to theAssociate Administrator for Safety, FRA, for review and approval by theAdministrator. If, after approval, a railroad desires to amend the randomtesting program implemented under this subpart, the railroad shall filewith FRA a notice of such amendment at least 30 days prior to the intendedeffective date of such action.

The method may not permit subjective factors to playa role in selection, <T3>i.e.</T3>, no employee may be selected as the result of the exerciseof discretion by the railroad. The selection method shall be capable ofverification with respect to the randomness of the selection process, andany records necessary to document random selection shall be retained fornot less than 24 months from the date upon which the particular sampleswere collected.(2) The program shall select for testing a sufficient number of employeesso that, during the first 12 months_(i) The random testing program is spread reasonably through the 12-monthperiod;(ii) The last test collection during the year is conducted at an annualizedrate of 50 percent; and(iii) The total number of tests conducted during the 12 months is equalto at least 25 percent of the number of covered employees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">During each subsequent 12-month period the program shall select fortesting a sufficient number of employees so that the number of tests conductedwill equal at least 50 percent of the number of covered employees. Annualizedpercentage rates shall be determined by reference to the total number ofcovered employees employed by the railroad at the beginning of the particulartwelve-month period or by an alternate method specified in the plan approvedby the Administrator.(3) Railroad random testing programs shall ensure to the maximum extentpracticable that each employee shall perceive the possibility that a randomtest may be required on any day the employee reports for work.(4) Notice of an employee's selection shall not be provided until the dutytour in which testing is to be conducted, and then only so far in advanceas is reasonably necessary to ensure the employee's presence at the timeand place set for testing.(5) The program shall include testing procedures and safeguards, and proceduresfor action based on positive test results, consistent with this part.(6) An employee shall be subject to testing only while on duty.(7) Each time an employee is selected for random testing the employee willbe informed that selection was made on a random basis. The program shallprovide that the employee will be permitted to retain a copy of a writingto that effect (e.g., a urine custody and control form with this informationset forth).(c) <T3>Approval</T3>. The Administrator will notify the railroad in writingwhether the program is approved as consistent with the criteria set forthin this part. If the Administrator determines that the program does notconform to those criteria, the Administrator will inform the railroad ofany matters preventing approval of the program, with specific explanationas to necessary revisions. The railroad shall resubmit its program withthe required revisions within 30 days of such notice. Failure to resubmitthe program with the necessary revisions will be considered a failure toimplement a program under this subpart.(d) <T3>Implementation. </T3>(1) No later than 45 days prior to commencementof random testing, the railroad shall publish to each of its covered employees,individually, a written notice that they will be subject to random drugtesting under this part. Such notice shall state the date for commencementof the program, shall state that the selection of employees for testingwill be on a strictly random basis, shall describe the consequences ofa determination that the employee has violated andSection; 219.102 or anyapplicable railroad rule, and shall inform the employee of the employee'srights under Subpart E of this part. A copy of the notice shall be providedto each new covered employee on or before the employee's initial date ofservice. Since knowledge of Federal law is presumed, nothing in this paragraphcreates a defense to a violation of andSection; 219.102 of this part.(2) Each railroad shall implement its approved random testing program notlater than November 20, 1989 (or, in the case of a railroad commencingoperations thereafter, on the expiration of 60 days from approval by theAdministrator or November 20, 1989, whichever is later).<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 219.603</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Participation in testing; refusals.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Participation</T3>.

(1) An employee who, upon being notified of the requirementto provide a sample under this subpart, refuses to provide a sample shallbe withdrawn from covered service and shall be deemed disqualified fora period of nine (9) months. The disqualification required by this paragraphshall apply with respect to employment in covered service by any railroadwith notice of such refusal. The requirement of disqualification for nine(9) months does not limit any discretion on the part of the railroad toimpose additional sanctions for the same or related conduct.(2) Upon being withdrawn from service under this section, the employeeshall be entitled to the same procedural protections as those set out inandSection; 219.213(b) of this part with respect to refusal of post-accidenttesting.
