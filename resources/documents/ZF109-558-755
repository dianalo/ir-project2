 NEC's solution isbased mainly on its S3100 office minicomputer range, linked with theperennial 9801 personal computer and the new 4800 workstations, as well ascommunications equipment such as its HyperCore Apex 2400 PABX.andP;  As part ofthis emphasis on strategic systems, NEC has announced that it will increasethe staff in its NEC Management Systems Research Institute subsidiary,established in January this year, to 100 employees by 1993.andP;  This companyprovides a clear role as consultant to NEC users.andP;  Nippon Telegraph's NTTData, now Japan's largest software company, displayed a range of productswhich were communications-related, including a network system based on SmartCard card terminals; portable Smart Card readers; an optical fibre screendeveloped in conjunction with Toray Co; and a local (within building) Call andamp;Answer System based on optical transmission from transceivers in the roof,transmitting to card-type receivers which displayed two lines of a message.andO;Data General's stand had a jungle theme and attracted many people to look atits AV 300/400 series Unix workstation and AV 4000/5000/6000 series servers.andM;New colour technologyandM;Other announcements made last week to coincide with the Data Show includedFujitsu Ltd, following announcements from both Mitsubishi Electric and NECregarding new notebooks, with both its FMR-50NB1, a notebook machine weighingonly 2 lbs with a memory card incorporated the main unit, as well as a 32-bitluggable, and a laptop, the FMR-50LX, both with thin film technology colourscreen and an 85Mb hard disk.andP;  In February, Fujitsu announced two models of amachine with a Double Super Twisted Nematic screen, the FMR-50TX and theFMR-50LX, but the new colour screen has six times the display resolution anda 10 times improved high-contrast function; the TFT screen is selling for$3,860 while the FMR-50TX7 unit retails for around $6,100, and the TFTcolour-based 50LX7 for $10,220.andP;  Both the 50TX7 and the 50LX are based on a20MHz 80386 chip, 2Mb main memory standard, expandable up to 16Mb and 10Mbrespectively; shipments are not due to start until March.andM;- o -andM;Fujitsu Ltd has also announced a multi-media optical filing system, the EFS80 series, which comes in three models: 80R, 80S and 80L: the systen supportsfiling of various types of data including code data from host computers,computer-aided designs, and personal computer-generated files; it is based onrewritable optical disks, each having 650Mb-per-side capacity and also has a19&quot; upright high-resolution display, and costs around $54,800 - nevertheless,Fujitsu hopes to sell 3,000 of the things annually.andM;- o -andM;Hitachi Ltd has announced the H-6975 Optical disk subsystem, large-scaleoptical disk drive for use with mainframe computers: it incorporates a 12&quot;second generation write-once optical drive with a maximum recording capacityof 7Gb; the H-6977-1 subsystem can switch optical disks according to aninstruction from the operator, and a maximum of four optical drives can besimultaneously mounted, while automatic changing of up to 47 disks in theH-6977-A2 unit and up to 64 in the H-6977-A3 Optical Disk Library issupported; both these drives are controlled by the H-6973-1 optical diskcontroller; no prices.andM;- o -andM;NEC Corp announced its engineering workstation based on the MIPS ComputerSystems Inc R3000 chip only in May this year but the company is hedging itsbets and is also planning a complex instruction set 68040-based workstationto be released this month: previous models of the 68000 family workstationsran System V.2, but the new one will run System V.4 and the system softwarewill also conform to X/Open Co Ltd Portability Guide 3 specs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
