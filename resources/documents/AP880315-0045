DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four men expected to be key prosecutionwitnesses at the racketeering trial of Rep. Mario Biaggi tried tooffer a $200,000 bribe to Attorney General Edwin Meese III througha middleman, Biaggi's lawyer claims.   The four ex-Wedtech Corp. officials ``corrupted an entireadministration _ this administration,'' Biaggi lawyer James LaRossasaid in his opening statement to the jury Monday.   A Justice Department official denied the bribe allegation as``preposterous.''   Attorneys for Biaggi, D-N.Y., and his six co-defendantscompleted their opening remarks, paving the way for the firstwitness to take the stand today in U.S. District Court.   The four _ Wedtech co-founder Fred Neuberger, former vicechairman Mario Moreno, ex-president Anthony Guariglia and formerexecutive vice president Lawrence Shorten _ have pleaded guilty tostate and federal charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutorsin return for leniency. They have yet to be sentenced.   Before their plea bargain was struck, LaRossa said, they offereda bribe to E. Robert Wallach, a close friend of Meese and a keyfigure in an investigation of a proposed $1 billion Iraqi pipeline.   LaRossa said the Wedtech officials told Wallach: ``We'll giveyou $200,000 for your friend Ed Meese. Get to Meese. Get us foreignasylum.''   At a second meeting, LaRossa said, the same money was offered toWallach, who was told: ``Get us an assurance that we won't go tojail.'' LaRossa said Wallach gave them that assurance.   ``So the people who are going to take the stand here and testify... they were trying to buy the attorney general of the UnitedStates,'' LaRossa charged.   He appeared to indicate that the money was never paid.   In Washington, one of Meese's attorneys, Nathan Lewin, said hehad spoken with Meese about LaRossa's remarks.   ``There was never any request that he (Meese) get involved inthe Wedtech investigation in any way. He never did. He never wouldhave contemplated doing that. It's preposterous to think thatthere's any scintilla of truth to that account,'' Lewin said.   LaRossa said the four ``lied, stole, plundered and raped'' thecompany, a Bronx defense contractor now in bankruptcy proceedings.   They created a $14 million slush fund, from which they stole $5million and ``the rest of the money was used to pay off people inWashington, union people'' and others, LaRossa said. ``Not onepenny went to Mario Biaggi.''   Biaggi, 70, the city's senior congressman; his eldest son; theelder Biaggi's law partner and four others are charged withracketeering for allegedly demanding millions of dollars in bribesto help the company win government contracts.   LaRossa claimed the no-bid contracts that transformed Wedtechfrom a small machine shop into a $100 million-a-year defensecontractor were awarded through White House influence.   He said Meese, then President Reagan's chief of staff, passedthe word to officials of the Navy, Army and Small BusinessAdministration that ``the president wants these contracts to go toWedtech.''   Former White House aide Lyn Nofziger was convicted last month ofillegal lobbying for Wedtech soon after he left the Reaganadministration.   A special prosecutor in Washington said in December that therewas insufficient evidence to charge Meese with any wrongdoing inthe Wedtech scandal. The investigation is continuing.   The prosecutor also is investigating Meese's role in thepipeline as a result of a memo written to Meese by Wallachmentioning planned payments to the Israeli Labor Party in a bid toprotect the project in Iraq from Israeli attack.</TEXT></DOC>
