The allegation and a demand for an explanation came in an openletter to Slovenia's Communist leader Milan Kucan and its interiorminister, Tomaz Ertl. It was published by the magazine Mladina,official mouthpiece of the Socialist Youth.   In the letter, the Socialist Youth alleged the coup was plannedfor earlier this year and included the arrests of nonconformistjournalists, writers and officials. It said its report was based onwidely spread rumors.   The military was to quell street demonstrations and other unrestthat were expected to follow the arrests, Mladina said in itscurrent edition.   The report said that according to rumors, the army had failed tonotify the country's and Slovenia's civilian Communist leadershipof the coup plans.   Slovenian security organizations notified Kucan and StaneDolanc, Slovenia's member in the collective presidency and nowYugoslavia's vice president, who prevented the plan, said themagazine.   From Kucan and Ertl ``we demand a clear and detailed answer to asimple question: How much truth is there in the above summarizedrumors?'' said Mladina.   France Zavrl, an editor of the magazine, told The AssociatedPress that Kucan promised to reply.   A number of articles published in the Slovenian press this year,particularly in Mladina, denounced the army as an undemocraticpro-Soviet institution intent on staging a military coup.   In April, a parliamentary commission responsible for statesecurity said the articles were part of an international conspiracyto weaken national defense and to overthrow the government.   The army has criticized Slovenia's leadership for not takingtough action against dissent in Slovenia. The dissent includesfrequent attacks on Yugoslav domestic and foreign policies and suchfigures as the late Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito.   Earlier this month, Mladina published what it said was a speechby Kucan at a closed session of Yugoslavia's Communist presidium onMarch 29 in which he said that the coup plan existed.   The article quoting Kucan's speech was immediately banned by theauthorities under the pretext that it revealed a state secret, saidZavrl.   Communists in Slovenia have often been at odds with officialYugoslav policy by offering unorthodox solutions to the country'sdeepening economic and social problems. The proposals includeintroduction of a more market-oriented economy and closer ties withthe West.   Yugoslavia is officially non-aligned.</TEXT></DOC>
