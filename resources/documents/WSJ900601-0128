The Salzmanns are the West Germans who own the crumblingvilla next to Mr. Hake's small, tidy house. In 1982,Ballenstedt's Communist bosses decided that the expansivegarden attached to the Salzmann villa was publicly owned, andthey gave Mr. Hake permission to build his house there.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I'm all for correcting the injustices of the past,&quot; saysthe East German farmer. &quot;But I can't very well pick up myhouse now and move it.&quot; As if to fan his anxiety, a nattilydressed West German couple showed up in his neighbor's yard afew weeks ago, snapping photographs of the area. It was theSalzmanns.   Mr. Hake is just one of thousands of East Germans caughtin a mounting legal cross fire over who owns what in thisonce staunchly Stalinist nation, whose former Communistleaders expropriated much of the country's private propertyand businesses years ago. Simply walking around Ballenstedt-- a town of 9,000 people tucked into the picturesquefoothills of East Germany's Harz Mountains -- one encountersenough potential land disputes to keep a good-sized law firmin business for the next decade.   East Berlin's new leaders want to dismantle thestate-ownership system, but they insist that former owners becompensated rather than having their property returned. Butin a statement that might signal a dispute with East Berlinon how to handle West Germans' claims on houses, apartmentsand businesses in East Germany, the Bonn government said thisweek that returning the property, not compensation, was thecorrect course.   &quot;Expropriated property is, in principle, to be handedback,&quot; said Hans Klein, chief spokesman for Chancellor HelmutKohl's coalition government, following a Bonn cabinet meetingat which the property question was discussed. &quot;Only inexceptional cases should compensation solutions be found,&quot; headded.   &quot;There's a storm brewing in East Germany right now,because many of the normal chains of property ownership werebroken by the Communists,&quot; says Hans-Jochen Moser, a WestGerman lawyer who helps people reclaim property in EastGermany.   The property issue is so explosive, in fact, that itwasn't addressed in the recently signed treaty on Germanmonetary and social union. Instead, the two countries agreedto hash out a supplementary agreement dealing with the web ofproperty claims.   West German experts estimate that as many as a millionpeople will lay claim to property they left behind in EastGermany when they fled west after World War II or during 40years of Communist rule. There are also many West Germans whoeither emigrated legally or inherited land from East Germanrelatives, but who, like the Salzmanns, didn't bother aboutthese legacies until now.   Adding to the difficulty of arriving at a compromise isthe sheer complexity of trying to transfer vast amounts ofproperty into private hands without the best of everythinggetting snapped up by relatively wealthy West Germans.Indeed, the image of West Germans crowding back into thecountry to take over factories and houses stirs deepresentment among East Germans, who refer to is as &quot;the bigsellout.&quot;   The Social Democrats -- the leading opposition party inBonn and the junior partner in the government coalition inEast Berlin -- are pushing for protections for the EastGermans, such as limits on the sale of property to Westernersand special rights of first refusal for East Germans.Meanwhile, the Christian Democrats, who head the rulingcoalitions in both Germanys, favor the quickest return toprivate property possible.   Much as it may rankle, the East Germans have few optionsbut to welcome their prosperous neighbors. West Germans havethe money and motivation to undertake the wholesalerebuilding of East Germany. If this doesn't happen, EastGermans will continue to flock over the border in search ofjobs and decent housing in the West.   &quot;This whole town needs to be put back into private handsto create the incentive to invest,&quot; says Wolfgang Gurke,Ballenstedt's newly elected Christian Democratic mayor. &quot;Butfiguring out how to do that is going to be a nightmare.&quot;   In a cluttered room on the second floor of the town hall,another harried official, Eberhard Dittmar, spends his dayssorting through more than 200 applications from residents whowant to buy their houses -- including one from Mr. Hake, whois seeking to buy the land under his house. And besides thatof the prince, the city has also registered claims from ahalf-dozen other West Germans. &quot;Of course, we can't doanything until this land issue is clarified by ourgovernment,&quot; says Mr. Dittmar.   The town actually started selling houses and land twomonths ago, but it quickly stopped after rumors spread thatCommunist bureaucrats were snatching up choice parcels forthemselves and ignoring potential conflicts with West Germanclaims. While this moratorium may be good for the cause ofjustice, it is the sort of policy that has some West Germanofficials worried.   West German business and political leaders, includingChancellor Helmut Kohl, have cautioned that delays inprivatizing property could slow the rush to redevelop EastGermany and make unification more painful. &quot;If you want toinvest in a country, it means you're going to buy something-- and you can't do that without clear ownership,&quot; saysUlrich Schmid, the East Berlin-based representative of WestGermany's Dresdner Bank AG.   Ballenstedt seems eager to welcome back its formerroyalty, especially if that means an infusion of money.Prince Eduard von Anhalt -- whose father's name, HerzogJoachim von Anhalt, still evokes respectful admiration fromelderly residents -- has announced that he wants to reclaimhis family's castle, the remnants of a huge hotel, severalsmaller palaces, and nearly 1,500 acres of farmland andforests. It all belonged to his father, who perished at thehands of the Communists after World War II.   In an arrival that seems like a page from &quot;Dr. Zhivago,&quot;the prince came to town in December, just after the BerlinWall opened, and found his family's crumbling castle dividedinto apartments and a forestry school. He later rented a roomat the end of one of the building's abandoned corridors, justto establish a base here.   To calm local fears, he has vowed not to kick out anyonewho lives on his contested property. And he has announced bigplans to transform the castle first into a training centerfor unemployed workers and later into a high-classhotel-management school. He also wants to rebuild the hoteloutside the castle gates, once the most elegant in theregion. Most important, according to the locals, he says hehas backers in the West willing to bankroll his dreams.   It all sounds wonderful to the residents of Ballenstedt,who grumble that the castle was about to collapse anyway. Mr.Gurke's Christian Democratic Union even campaigned on aplatform that included a promise to welcome back the prince.&quot;The city won't have any money to rebuild the castle,&quot; saysthe mayor. &quot;We need all our money for building apartments.&quot;   At the center of such debates is East Germany's concept ofVolkseigentum, or &quot;people's property.&quot; Everything snatched upby the Communists during various waves of nationalization,including the sweeping agricultural land reform of 1946implemented by the Soviets, fell into this amorphouscategory. The theory was that, since everyone owned theproperty, everyone would take care of it.   But like so many things in East Germany, the concept neverworked the way it was intended. Typically, the finestproperties were quietly distributed to party functionariesand members of East Germany's hated secret police.</TEXT></DOC>
