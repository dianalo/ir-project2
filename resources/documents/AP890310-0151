The moves came as Foreign Minister Moshe Arens left for a 10-dayvisit to the United States, where officials are expected to pressfor less violence in Israel's effort to halt the 15-monthPalestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   Arens is to meet Monday with President Bush and Secretary ofState James Baker. He is expected to seek U.S. support for effortsto bring peace to the occupied lands.   In clashes Friday in the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Rafah, troopsshot and killed 22-year-old Suher Lutfi al Hams, Arab reports said.   Arab reporters and hospital officials said at least 15Palestinians were wounded in clashes in the occupied lands. An armyofficial confirmed the death and seven wounded, and said he waschecking the other injury reports.   The death brought to 394 the number of Palestinians killed sincethe start of the uprising against Israeli rule of the occupiedlands. Seventeen Israelis, including six soldiers, also have died.   Israel has controlled the territories since it captured them fromJordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.   By removing some troops from refugee camps, the government isshifting the emphasis on its policy from a widespread army presencein the lands to fewer but better-trained anti-riot units.   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, commander of the Gaza region, toldthe daily Hebrew Haaretz the changes are meant to ease frictionbetween soldiers and Palestinians.   The occupied territories are home to more than 1.7 millionPalestinians.   Gaza Strip reporters said the army on Friday moved troops out ofthe Jabaliya refugee camp. Soldiers also continued for a second dayto move out of the Shati refugee camp to posts near the entrancegates, Arab reporters said.   Residents of Gaza City said they saw fewer army patrols, despitea general strike called by the underground leadership of theuprising.   Jabaliya, where the uprising began, is the Gaza's largest refugeecamp, with nearly 54,000 residents, according to figures from theUnited Nations. It is just northeast of Gaza City.   Shati has more than 42,000 refugee residents, according to theU.N. figures. It is on the Mediterranean Sea inside Gaza City.   A military source, who insisted on anonymity, said more troopswould be moved next week in the Gaza Strip and in a few troublespots in the West Bank, including the town of Qalqilya.   As part of the moves, fewer reserve army troops will be sent tothe territories. Instead, increased paramilitary Border Police unitsand specially trained mechanized infantry battalions will be morewidely used.   ``The ultimate goal will be fewer fatalities, which is somethingeverybody wants,'' an army official who spoke on condition ofanonymity said in an interview.   He said Border Police officers are trained in riot control andthat ``they have caused far fewer fatalities per incident than thearmy.''   The officers, two-third of whom are Israeli Arabs, have areputation for relying on wooden batons and tear-gas to scatterdemonstrators rather than guns. ``They seem to get their messageacross without opening fire,'' the army official said.   He said more Border Police have been recruited to deal with theuprising, but declined to give figures. The mechanized infantryunits, which will operate as mobile strike forces, will not be readyuntil April, he said.   Elsewhere in Gaza on Friday, the army destroyed rooms in thehomes of three Palestinians from the Khan Yunis refugee camp whowere suspected of throwing firebombs at Arab collaborators, an armycommander told Army radio.   ``I hope tomorrow when the local population gets up and sees thedestroyed rooms it will serve as a warning and there will be lessviolence,'' said the commander, who was not identified by name inkeeping with military policy.   The radio broadcast the sounds of bulldozers smashing intoconcrete amid protest whistling and jeering by Palestinians.</TEXT></DOC>
