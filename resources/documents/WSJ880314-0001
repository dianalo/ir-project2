When a transfer agent prints the number of shares and name of the owner on a blank certificate, the Light Signatures system scans 100 tiny areas on the security to measure the light coming through those areas. The distribution of fibers in paper varies enough from sheet to sheet that the system can thereby determine each certificate's &quot;fingerprint.&quot;    The system combines that information with the other data being printed on the security, encodes it and prints it on a magnetic strip at the bottom of the certificate. Terminals that Light Signatures, a Los Angeles-based unit of Telecredit Inc., will rent to banks and brokerage firms can read the strip and check it against the printed data.    Securities executives have worried that advances in color reproduction would trigger a rise in counterfeiting, but three industry groups and many banks and brokerage houses endorse the Light Signatures method. &quot;The guarantee against counterfeiting is almost absolute,&quot; says John M. Morris, a vice president at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.    Raymond J. Riley, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., says the system also will cut costs by letting banks and brokers largely automate securities processing.    A More Potent Program   For Manipulating Text   WITH Symantec Corp.'s recent introduction of GrandView, the important but nebulous field of text-management software is starting to come into focus.    GrandView, which the Mountain View, Calif., company says will be available at the end of the month, uses a new software technique called &quot;hypertext&quot; to deal with text much as a spreadsheet deals with numbers. Without such software, a salesman could keep computer files on his clients by name, but to find customers who might need more products in the next two months, he'd have to go through each file individually. That would be like a spreadsheet where it was possible to read down the columns but not across the rows. GrandView, however, enables a user to generate crosslinked lists automatically.    Barry Thall, a surgeon in Thousand Oaks, Calif., and an enthusiastic test user of the software, says he used it to supervise construction of a house. He made a room-by-room list of tasks, but the contractor told him he needed it reorganized according to who would do them -- the electrician, the plumber and other subcontractors. Dr. Thall says he was able to produce the requested list &quot;at the push of a button.&quot;    Two other text-management products, Lotus Development Corp.'s Agenda and Persoft Inc.'s IZE, were announced earlier. But GrandView may have an edge: It also serves as an outliner, an established software function, helping users lay out plans for a project or lengthy report. Esther Dyson, an industry analyst, says this function means &quot;GrandView is probably the one that people will most readily jump on.&quot;    How to Talk   To Your Computer   PEOPLE SOON may be on speaking terms with their personal computers.    Forum Systems Inc., Santa Barbara, Calif., is about to introduce a product called PC/Forum that will let users send combinations of voice and written messages over computer networks. For instance, a supervisor could annotate a document with voice messages; the recipient would put his cursor on marks left on the document and would hear his boss's comments on each part of the material.    Similar systems have been available for some years but have cost $25,000 to $30,000 and have run only on hardware designed specifically for the task. Forum Systems has shrunk the required hardware to the point that it fits on one circuit board that works in an IBM-compatible personal computer; the board plus the PC/Forum software is expected to cost about $1,000 when the product becomes available in May.    To enter voice data, a user need operate only his telephone and a &quot;mouse&quot; on his computer. Amy Wohl, a consultant in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., says PC/Forum lets people use computers &quot;without changing the whole way they do things.&quot;    Speeding Transmission   Of Color Photos   IN A BUSINESS where even minutes can matter, National Digital Corp., Falls Church, Va., has announced a computer system that may let news magazines extend photo deadlines by as much as a day.    The system relies on recent advances in color scanners' resolution and data-transmission techniques. A photographer in Europe could use it to send a series of color photos to a magazine in the U.S. in about a minute each via a scanner. The photos would appear on a computer workstation, where someone could look at them -- enlarging, shrinking and cropping as desired -- to make selections.    The photographer would then re-transmit any requested photos using a high-resolution scanner, a process that takes about 15 minutes per photo and yields a picture sharp enough for a magazine to use. Without the system, color photos can be sent by wire, but the transmission is slow and awkward. More often, photos are sent by plane.    &quot;If something is happening overseas Thursday morning, that's really pushing our deadline,&quot; says Richard Folkers, a photo editor at U.S. News andamp; World Report. &quot;But we could go till Friday morning with the new system,&quot; which the magazine is just starting to test, and still meet the Friday midnight deadline. </TEXT></DOC>
