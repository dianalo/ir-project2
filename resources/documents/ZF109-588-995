(Interviews).andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Shielding Prime From Mini DownturnandM;Jack Shields is a hard man to find.andP;  Although he was installed as Prime'spresident in the brutal Massachusetts cold of January 1990, it wasn't untilPrime's users held their annual meeting in the humid Florida summer thatShields made a formal public appearance.andP;  (See &quot;Prime's Users Still on Hold,&quot;DATAMATION, September 1, p. 61.)andM;DATAMATION visited with Shields recently and, like many users who attendedthe Florida gathering, found him to be a down-to-earth, optimistic executive.andO;Shields, who left the post of vice president, for worldwide sales and serviceat Digital Equipment Corp. in October 1989, had often been mentioned as beingnext in line for Ken Olsen's post.andP;  Some say he left Digital in a disputewith Olsen over how to manage the company in a slowing economy and changingmarketplace.andM;Shields has brought to Prime his conviction that a company must change tomeet the needs of a market in order to survive.andP;  Now he states clearly, ifwith some frustration, that the public has the wrong image of Prime.andP;  It's nolonger just a traditional minicomputer maker, he says--rather, it's a systemsintegrator that can survive and win in a climate that has become increasinglychilly to Rte.andP;  128 mini marketers.andP;  He's also brought his ambitions; he'dlike to build Prime into a $10 billion company by 2000, from expected 1990revenues of $1.5 billion.andM;In August, Prime took its first major steps toward Shield's ambitious goal bystriking a deal with reduced instruction set computing (RISC) chip maker MipsComputer Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., to use its microprocessortechnology in a new line of UNIX-based EXL 7000 computers.andP;  This summer, thecompany also made available on the EXL computers thousands of applicationsthat previously ran only on Prime's 50 series machines.andP;  These two movescould energize Prime's sluggish EXL sales, although some analysts questionwhether they may cannibalize the 50 series line.andM;Q: How are you positioning Prime in the marketplace today?andM;A: I would describe [Prime] as an international company providing computersolutions and services to customers in automotive, aerospace and othermanufacturing industries, and [as] a supplier of commercialtransaction-processing systems to a variety of users, primarily medium-sizedcompanies, in many different industries.andM;Q: You don't seem to profile Prime at all as a minicomputer company, but as asystems company.andP;  Is that a point of differentiation?andM;A: If you look at the revenue structure of the company, we are a companythat's greater than 75% in the systems solutions services business and lessthan 25% in what people would consider the traditional proprietaryminicomputer business.andP;  The makeup of the company is completely different,perhaps, from what people have in their minds.andM;Q: With so much dark financial news surrounding some of the traditionalminicomputer makers, I'm sure that some customers ask, &quot;Why do I want to dobusiness with one of these folks?&quot;andP;  How do you answer this question?andM;A: We will be announcing major orders from significant Fortune 500 companiesover the next five or six months that will show that these companies aren'tabout to invest their future .andP;  .  .  with a company that they don't thinkhas financial viability.andP;  We just won a 1,000-workstation order at Phillips;we won a $20 million order from Peugeot.andP;  We're in the middle of a $30million order with Fiat.andP;  We just won a big order from Martin Marietta, .andP;  . andO;.  a big order from Bath Ironworks, .andP;  .  .  a big order from Boeing [andone] from Thorne in the U.K.andP;  So they're voting by giving us orders.andM;Q: Do you foresee significant growth in demand for systems over the next fewyears?andM;A: There's a huge market--$350 billion.andP;  If we can't get 10 of it, whether itgrows or shrinks, there's something wrong with us.andP;  .  .  .  [What's more] Weare positioned with a substantial part of the company in a high-growth market[CAD/CAM], and we expect to exceed the growth opportunities there.andM;Q: How do you explain to your customers this rapid transition fromminicomputer maker to systems provider?andP;  How do you describe to them thevalue that you add?andM;A: The value added .andP;  .  .  [from] our Computervision division is the bestsoftware to do the job for the customer .andP;  .  .  .  In that area we competeagainst IBM, Intergraph and others, selling solutions.andP;  So that's very easy.andM;In our traditional business, .andP;  .  .  we have existing [50 series] customerswhom we continue to support.andP;  We're continuing a very, very large investmentin our 50 series product offering to ensure our customers that they can grow,while we're also investing in an open systems strategy.andM;We're bringing out a set of CMOS [complementary metal oxide semiconductor]processors this quarter that have enormous price/performance improvements,better cost of ownership [and a] multiprocessor implementation.andM;For our new customers who want open systems, the differentiation is aroundthe software.andP;  There hasn't really been a robust product offering in terms ofcommercially acceptable UNIX.andP;  [We still] provide our customers a scalable,high-performance UNIX offering pointed at transaction processing [and]high-availability applications, and give better performance to our customersby using commercially available open systems.andM;Q: Are those your own CMOS chips?andP;  And will the new 50 series midrange systemwith CMOS support UNIX, or will it continue to be a proprietary system?andM;A: They're gate arrays that [we designed and that] are being madespecifically for us.andP;  [The new system will] continue to be 50 series-based,but it's POSIX compliant.andP;  So it's not totally proprietary.andM;Q: How heavily is Prime investing in research and development?andP;  Can you giveme some rough estimates of where your Randamp;D dollars are going?andM;A: More is going into the 50 series at the moment, and less is going into[other products].andP;  I think the ratio is 80:20.andP;  The Randamp;D investment issignificant.andP;  It's about 15% of the revenue, which I expect will be about abillion and a half [in 1990].andM;Q: What role will your 286 and 386-based desktop systems play in your future?andM;A: We've had available .andP;  .  .  a series of EXL products that are basicallyrunning UNIX on the desktop PCs.andP;  We still expect to have a family ofproducts that will go from desktop all the way up running UNIX.andM;Q: They haven't sold in significant numbers, though, have they?andM;A: No.andM;Q: The whole computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) market is onethat people have expected to explode for years.andP;  Are you seeing any signsfrom users that this market is on the upswing?andM;A: The market itself is growing anywhere in the 12 to 15% range.andP;  We're goingto grow a little bit better than the market.andP;  People, especiallyinternationally, are investing in their competitive advantage by implementingsystems that will help them bring products to market sooner.andP;  The companiesthat can reduce their time to market will be the survivors and the winners,assuming they build a good product.andM;Q: What percentage of your 1990 revenues do you think will come from salesoverseas?andM;A: Sixty percent and growing.andP;  Clearly the market is international, notU.S.-based.andP;  So, as a company, we're trying to think more internationally.andO;What that means is that you build international products, you don't buildAmerican products and adapt them.andP;  So we need to .andP;  .  .  introduce kanjiinto our products, do our literature properly and support those customers.andO;And that's going to require a little bit more time.andM;Q: Technical applications on open systems still outnumber commercialapplications.andP;  What value is Prime bringing to the commercial user of opensystems?andM;A: We will bring somewhere in the area of 4,000 to 5,000 commercialapplications to UNIX through our Prime Information system [Prime's PICK-basedrelational database management system].andP;  .  .  .  No one else in the industrywill have that number of commercial applications on an open system.andM;Q: How is that going to be feasible?andM;A: That software is available on Prime Information, and we have taken thePrime Information product and essentially made it compliant with our UNIXproduct offering.andM;Q: Any idea of taking the company public again?andM;A: Love to.andP;  As soon as we pay off some of this debt, we can get some equityparticipation--the clearness to take this company public.andM;Q: What's the timeframe you're looking at, potentially, for a publicoffering?andM;A: Oh, God, I don't know.andP;  It will depend on what the market conditions are,and interest and equity participation by others, and things that ourinvestors would put together .andP;  .  .  .  It's a [long-term] goal.andM;Q: Does it make any sense for you to look at other partners joining thiscompany, the way that, for example, Unisys just sold a piece of itself toMitsui?andP;  Are there people saying, &quot;Gee, we can give you even a higher liftthan you may have now?&quot;andM;A: I'm sure there are many out there who would just love to somehow partnerwith us.andM;Q: Are you returning anybody's calls?andM;A: I suppose we talk to everybody.andP;  There's no cost in talking to people.andO;This is an industry where there are enormous opportunities for alliances andpartnerships--and people should take advantage of that wherever they can.andO;And we will if [the opportunity] presents itself.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
