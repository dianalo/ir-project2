Glenn English, D-Okla.   English has asked more than 40 organizations and individuals totestify before his House Agriculture subcommittee on conservation,credit and rural development.   The hearings, beginning Tuesday, will continue through June.Later in the summer, the committee will go on the road to hear fromresidents of rural areas.   ``Unless action is taken, virtually every citizen of the countrywill be forced to live in a metropolitan area,'' English said.``That scenario is good for no one. It would overburden our citiesand suburbs as much as it would devastate our rural communities.''   English said he wants the rural development legislation thatemerges from the hearings to be part of the 1990 farm bill, themeasure that will determine the government' farm policy for severalyears.   ``The difficulties plaguing rural America do not have a singlefocus,'' he said. ``Our efforts are incomplete for example, if weaddress capital investment issues, but ignore those of education orrural health care.''   The problem the government faces is money.   ``Any new initiative on which we embark will have to bear thosefinancing restrictions in mind,'' said English.   He said the subcommittee will be looking at ways to use existingfunds and resources better and find outside financing.   The Bush administration wants to cut the agriculture budget by$1.1 billion in the new fiscal year and has suggested that some ofthose cuts come in rural development programs like water and sewergrants, business and industrial loans and community facility loans.   The issue of rural development is not new, said Bob Bergland,who was agriculture secretary under President Carter and now headsthe National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.   ``The out migration from rural areas ebb and flow. That of thelast two or three years is as bad as it was in the 40s and 50s,''Bergland said Friday.   Bergland, scheduled to testify before the committee Thursday,said that in the 1960s people were moving back to the farm in largenumbers.   ``There was the flower children syndrome,'' he said in referenceto the era in which young people were rejecting the rat race of thebusiness world in an effort to find a more peaceful life in nature.   At that time, many people set up small farms, Bergland said.   He said the government's biggest role is in improving educationand infrastructure (road, sewers, water, telephones, electricalservice) in farm communities.   ``The high school drop out rate is as bad as urban ghettos,''Bergland said. And, so is poverty, he said.   ``The difference is, you can see poverty in the cities. But inthe country it's hidden over the next hill.''   He said students who go to college don't come back to the smalltowns because they can make more money elsewhere.   ``We have an enormous brain drain,'' he said. ``When we startworking on industry that has a limited work force, it's a problem.''   He said the changing face of American agriculture hascontributed to the problem.   ``We have 2.2 million farms and 15 percent of them produce 90percent of what is sold,'' he said. ``Attrition is taking its toll.There aren't so many people going broke, but there aren't any newstarts.''   He called on the government to ``break this cycle'' of youngpeople leaving rural areas.   He said the movement should start locally with help from stateuniversities and coordination by the federal government.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 4</NOTE></DOC>
