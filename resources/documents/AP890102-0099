(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ``The truth-tellers of the nation,'' havespoken out in a new book by and about teen-agers and their views andhopes.   ``I'd like to be able to walk down American streets at midnightwith the same ease I'd walk down the street at noon,'' oneteen-ager, Tobdeleya Dumas of Cleveland, said in ``Voices of Hope.''   Jana Reiss, of Galesburg, Ill., reflected on the maturationprocess.   ``As people grow older, they begin to see things in shades ofgray and not in simple black and white as they did as children,''she was quoted in the book as saying. ``When I was a child, mydreams were simple and selfish. Now I hope for feelings, not things.I dream more for my friends and family, and less for myself.''   American teen-agers are ``incredibly idealistic'' and want tohelp solve society's problems, but often are frustrated because theythink they lack the means to make a difference, said Greg Jao, aneditor of the book.   ``They honestly want to be able to talk to their parents and beinvolved in politics, but they're also very cynical because theydon't feel any real change can come'' from their efforts, said Jao,20.   ``Voices of Hope'' follows ``Teenagers Themselves'' and ``Voicesof Conflict,'' a series researched by the staff of the studentnewspaper at Glenbard East High School in this western Chicagosuburb.   Staff members of the Echo newspaper traveled to 35 cities,interviewed 2,000 students and collected questionnaires from 5,000more in all 50 states, under the direction of journalism teacher andnewspaper adviser Howard Spanogle.   ``Teen-agers are unique because they are the truth tellers of thenation,'' Spanogle said.   Students interviewed, ages 14 through 19, ranged from the``wildly hedonistic stereotype'' of the inner cities to the ``deeplyreligious'' of more rural areas, Jao said.   ``As opposed to statistical studies ... we've tried for much moreof a qualitative approach,'' said Jao, now an English student at theUniversity of Chicago.   Students want an end to all forms of discrimination _ againstthem as young people and against minorities, Spanogle said.   They seek ``communication between generations, equal treatmentfor teen-agers, openness to all viewpoints, and awareness of socialproblems,'' said Spanogle, who has been advising the newspaper for21 years.   Researchers also interviewed adults such as U.S. Sen. Paul Simon,D-Ill., for perspectives on issues that most concern teen-agers.Nobel Prize-winner Leon Lederman, director of Fermi NationalAccelerator Laboratory near Batavia, Ill., asserts that scienceeducation in the United States is ``bloody awful.'' And Doug Wood,director of youth ministries at Dallas' First Baptist Church,suggests ways the church can elevate the moral fiber of young people.   Sean Mix of Seattle said of teen-age drinking: ``Teen views andadult views don't really differ ... when it comes to handlingpressure ... because we handle it about the same way. Our parentsdrink, and so do we.''   Megan McKinney of Abilene, Texas, talked about morals.   ``In order to know what is right or wrong ... consult the Bible.Unfortunately, in an increasingly immoral society, people succumb totheir natural urges rather than overcome them,'' she said.   ``One reason I believed sex should only happen within themarriage vows came from the examply my parents `supposedly' set,''said a South Carolina girl who was not identified by name. ``When Ifound out a year ago that my parents were married in '69 instread of'68, making me a child conceived out of wedlock, I was shocked andconfused.''   The ideal family was on the mind of Kimberly Aretta of Uniontown,Pa.   ``The perfect family would be one that is always there for youeven if you're wrong ... one that understands the feelings of ateen-ager and realizes we will make plenty of mistakes,'' she said.   Jao said the book is a challenge to America to find ways forteen-agers to channel their hopes and enthusiasm.   ``Teens are incredibly idealistic,'' he said. ``There's a realfrustration people perceive as apathy, that they don't know how tochannel that energy. We need to find ways to channel that incredibleidealism.''   The book and the two others in the series were published by AdamaBooks of New York and is available at major bookstores nationwide.</TEXT></DOC>
