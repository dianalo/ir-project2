In this invention, the flowof the heat medium to be supplied to the heat exchanger was designedto remain constant throughout the heat recovery operation and the heatregeneration operation by providing a circulation tube in order to bringa part of or the whole recovered heat medium, which came from the heatexchanger during the heat recovery operation, back to the heat mediumsupply side. As a result, the laminar film resistance of heat transferbetween the heat medium and the wall of the heat exchanger tube of theheat exchanger could be restrained and a big range of temperature risecould be obtained. In addition, the above method has a merit that theheat recovery at the predetermined temperature can be done from the beginningby circulating the recovered heat medium completely without taking itout in the beginning of the operation.
