In return, Walsh apparently agreed to revoke the subpoenas heissued to four Israelis who arranged the 1985 and 1986 shipment ofU.S.-made anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to Iran, theofficial and a U.S. lawyer indicated.   ``He will get what he wants without us having to give up what wewanted,'' said the Israeli official, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   Melvin Rishe, a lawyer representing the Israeli government, said``we have reached terms of how we would proceed, making litigationunnecessary.''   Israel's government wanted the subpoenas dropped, contendingthat all four Israelis were acting under its orders and thus wereimmune from prosecution and questioning by U.S. officials.   The agreement with Walsh is ``on a government-to-government''basis, according to Israeli embassy spokesman Yossi Gal, whichmeans any questions for the four must be channeled through officialIsraeli representatives.   Walsh and the Israeli Embassy issued brief statements announcingthe cooperation agreement, but said the contents will remainclassified.   ``The government of the state of Israel and the office of theindependent counsel have signed an agreement covering thecooperation of the government of Israel in the Iran-Contrainvestigation,'' Walsh said in a prepared statement.   ``Independent counsel Walsh expressed satisfaction with theagreement and said his office looks forward to continuedcooperation with the state of Israel,'' the statement said. TheIsraeli statement was almost identical.   The documents handed over to Walsh include detailed financialand historical chronologies prepared by Israel for thecongressional Iran-Contra committees last summer, said the Israeliofficial.   When Israel gave the chronologies to Congress, it stipulatedthat Walsh be denied access to the documents because of his refusalto grant immunity to the four Israelis.   Along with the documents, Walsh has also been given writtenanswers to the questions posed last year by the congressionalinvestigators with regard to the chronologies, the official said.   The documents are expected to help Walsh answer some of hisquestions about Israel's Swiss bank account, which handled thefunds for the shipments to Iran.   Walsh wanted the information to help him corroborate his caseagainst former White House aides Oliver North and John Poindexter,as well as businessmen Richard Secord and his partner Albert Hakim.All four have been indicted on charges of defrauding the U.S.government through the arms sales and the diversion of profits tothe Nicaraguan Contra rebels.   Last year, Walsh subpoenaed Israeli businessmen Yaakov Nimrodiand Al Schwimmer, as well as former foreign ministry director DavidKimche and government counter-terrorism adviser Amiram Nir. Nirresigned from his post last week.   The agreement was finalized 10 days ago by two senior governmentrepresentatives who held talks in Washington with Walsh and hisstaff. The Israeli government approved the accord, the Israeliofficial said.   ``The negotiations were difficult,'' said Walsh spokesman JimWieghart. ``Israel is a sovereign state with certain nationalsecurity interests, which they have to defend. We recognized that,but on the other hand, we had our needs in this investigation,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
