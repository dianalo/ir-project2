The Labor Department agency proposed $55,000 in penalties for 11 alleged instances of willfully violating federal record-keeping requirements. Monsanto has 15 days in which to contest the charges. The plant produces agricultural and industrial chemicals.    OSHA said Monsanto failed to keep a required log of injuries and illnesses during parts of this year and last. An agency official said an inspection indicated &quot;an ongoing pattern of indifference to maintaining on-the-job injury and illness data&quot; at the plant.    Among the improperly reported or unreported instances alleged by OSHA were injuries that required medical treatment, work restrictions, lost work days and in some cases worker-compensation claims.    The agency initiated its inspection of the plant after a worker complaint.    Lee Hebert, plant manager at the Nitro plant, said that in the 11 instances cited by OSHA, &quot;the company and the employees acted in good faith. We give top priority to the safety and health of all our employees.&quot; Mr. Hebert said Monsanto will investigate the agency's findings and, if warranted, will appeal them. Monsanto is a chemical, plastics and pharmaceuticals company. </TEXT></DOC>
