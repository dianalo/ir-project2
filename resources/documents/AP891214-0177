But the task is acomplicated by ingrained prejudices in Japan toward foreigners.   The intent of the Foreign Ministry's public relations campaignis get the Japanese to give more heartfelt support to the aid theirgovernment now is giving in increasing sums to developing countries.   ``Because of our geographic isolation, it is important forpeople to understand our need and obligation to contribute to therest of the world,'' Taro Ishibashi, director of public relationsfor the Foreign Ministry, said in an interview.   ``People think, `Why should we contribute to the developingworld who don't work hard and are very lazy.' We need to persuadethem that contributing to the Third World is good for their ownlives.''   But Japanese attitudes toward outsiders are seen as an obstacle.Many foreigners in Japan, for instance, face resistance if they tryto move into well-established Japanese neighborhoods.   Two recent incidents revealed prejudices even on the officiallevel:   _National Police Agency officials were obliged to apologize tothe Pakistan Embassy for an internal police document that claimedPakistani suspects smell, have skin diseases and tell lies. Anembassy spokesman, Mohammed Sharif, said the embassy had acceptedthe apology and trusted police promises that they would change theobjectionable document.   _Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was criticized by Justice MinisterMasao Goto on grounds that he brushed off Korean residents whocomplained they had been harassed following a scandal involvingpolitical donations by a group linked to Communist North Korea.   Perhaps the best-known slip occurred three years ago, whenthen-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said the average intelligencein the United States is lower than that of Japan ``because of aconsiderable number of blacks, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans'' in theU.S. population.   Japan has small minority groups, including 700,000 Koreans, manyof whom are descended from workers brought here for forced laborduring World War II, when Japan ruled Korea as a colony. Hundredsof Indochinese refugees and Japanese ``war orphans'' raised inChina have resettled here, as have thousands of illegal migrantworkers from Asia and Latin America.   The Philippine government has occasionally protested treatmentof its nationals in Japan, most employed in bars, nightclubs andconstruction sites and often mistreated by criminal gangs.   Most migrant labor is banned by Japanese law, and even legalimmigrants face subtle and sometimes overt discrimination in theirsearch for jobs, housing and acceptance as members of Japanesesociety.   Despite government calls for ``kokusaika,'' orinternationalization, many Japanese express concern about copingwith new neighbors from the Third World, people with differentlanguages, foods and customs.   ``The average person will oppose even the construction of aone-room apartment next door,'' Osamu Tateno wrote in a letter tothe Asahi Shimbun, the national newspaper. ``I can't believe thesame person will gladly lend a hand ... while their real estatevalues plummet as the number of apartment houses for foreignersmushrooms in their neighborhood.''   ``Japan's still really a `sakoku,' or closed country,'' saysretiree Katsuji Tsuchida, referring to national seclusion duringthe Tokugawa era of 1639-1854. ``Japanese people are stillprejudiced against Southeast Asians and other developingcountries.''   ``We need to become more international,'' Tsuchida said at a oneday Foreign Ministry blitz in which officials explained Japan'sforeign policy to some 1,300 people in Gifu, a city in mountainouscentral Japan.   The Foreign Ministry has sent officials, experts and businessmento more than 1,000 communities since April, seeking to drive itspoint home.   Since taking office in August, Foreign Minister Taro Nakayamahas ordered additional efforts, especially through television andcartoons, to build a public consensus in favor of a generous,internationalized Japan, officials say.   ``People think the government is trying to steal their money andthrow it into the sea of the developing world,'' said Ishibashi,the public relations director. ``It's a primitive but genuinefeeling.''   ``It's important today for the government to reach the hearts ofordinary people,'' he added.   Japan became the world's largest donor of non-military foreignaid in 1988, surpassing the United States, with its actualdisbursement reaching $9.13 billion, according to the ForeignMinistry.   More Japanese foreign aid won't necessarily change ingrainedprejudice against its recipients, but Foreign Ministry officialssay icreasingly active private aid groups are a sign that themessage of internationalization is beginning to hit home on apersonal level.   One example is a group on the southern island of Kyushu calledthe Karaimo (Sweet Potato) Exchange Foundation. It has begun tosend youths to villages in Thailand and the Philippines and toestablish partnerships between farming communities for technicaland emergency assistance.   The government, hoping to fill gaps in its own aid program, thisyear for the first time offered financial assistance to privategroups doing overseas development work.   ``I still have some hope for the younger generation,'' saidIshibashi. ``I hope they will understand the importance of thepleasure of voluntarily being part of the global community.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Friday PMs, Dec. 22</NOTE></DOC>
