The following neutrino-induced processeswere considered: resonance production, quasielastic scattering, and coherentmeson production off nuclei or nuclear fragments. It is shown that thetotal exclusive cross section in a certain kinematical domain is energyindependent at high energies (above 20 GeV). This fact can, in principle,be used for relative normalization of the neutrino flux.</TEXT></DOC>
