The company's genetically altered cotton plants and dozensof other crops being raced to market promise cheaper and morebountiful food and fiber for consumers. They are engineeredto better weather drought, frost, disease and pests.</LP><TEXT>   The plants also are pitting some of the nation's largestchemical and agriculture-seed companies against majorenvironmental groups. For, in addition to their otherproperties, many of the new plants are bred to be moretolerant of weedkillers that might maim less sturdy crops.   Companies rushing to market herbicide-tolerant crops --including Ciba-Geigy Corp., Du Pont Co. and Monsanto Co. --say the plants will increase output while reducingagriculture's environmental impact by letting farmers usenew, less toxic herbicides that are effective in much smallerdoses than traditional weedkillers. Calgene says itsherbicide-resistant cotton would cut weedkiller use on cottoncrops by 60% to 90%. Says Daniel O. Wagster II, a Calgenevice president: &quot;Environmentalists should embrace&quot;herbicide-tolerant plants.   But some environmental and other groups want to keep theplants at arm's length. In a report last year, 18environmental, farm, consumer and church organizations saidthe plants' higher resistance levels would prompt farmers toincrease their use of weedkillers, which in turn would meanhigher residues on food and in ground water. The new plantscould also promote the use of herbicides in areas wherelittle is now used, such as in the timber industry, thereport said. Moreover, some plant research is aimed atdeveloping strains resistant to older, more toxicweedkillers, which could increase use of those chemicals aswell.   Many of the new crops &quot;are just a ruse&quot; to invigorate the$4 billion-a-year business in agricultural chemicals andfurther foul the environment, says Jane F. Rissler, abiotechnology specialist for the National WildlifeFederation.   Some environmental groups and public officials say the newplants will perpetuate agriculture's chemical dependence,shifting attention from other, &quot;sustainable&quot; approaches. Sen.Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, plans to introduce a billnext month that would end government funding of research onherbicide-tolerant crops. He wants to shift the money toresearch on farm methods that slash chemical use.   The nonprofit Minnesota Food Association is prodding theUniversity of Minnesota and others to halt theirherbicide-tolerance research. And the CaliforniaBiotechnology Action Council and 14 other groups are workingto block commercialization of such plants and lobbyingCalifornia Gov. Pete Wilson to bar field tests.   Concern extends to the safety of the plants themselves.Genetic tinkering can change the toxicity and nutrient valueof foods, says Michael Phillips, senior associate of theCongressional Office of Technology Assessment, which isproducing a report on the subject. But Ganesh Kishore,Monsanto's plant protection and improvement manager, says,&quot;The probability is very low . . . that a toxin would beproduced that we don't know to look for.&quot;   Mr. Kishore and others emphasize the big toll that weedstake on agricultural output. Iowa farmers lose 10% to 25% oftheir corn and soybean crops to weeds. California tomatogrowers can save as much as $100 an acre by usingherbicide-resistant plants, according to a report by theNational Research Council, an arm of the National Academy ofSciences.   But herbicide use has a significant public-health impact.Herbicides make up nearly two-thirds of all agriculturalchemicals used on plants and have been linked to 31% of therisk of benign and malignant tumors associated with allchemical residues in fresh foods, the National ResearchCouncil says. Herbicides also have been linked to nervousdisorders, behavioral changes and skin diseases in humans.The Environmental Protection Agency generally rates the newherbicides as less toxic than ordinary weedkillers.   Much of the debate so far centers on Calgene's cotton,which early next year will become the firstherbicide-resistant plant for which a company seeksregulatory approval. The plant is genetically engineered towithstand the weedkiller bromoxynil, made by Rhone-PoulencS.A. Cotton farmers currently spend $150 million a year onherbicides, but still lose 7% of their crop to weeds, saysthe National Cotton Council of America. By allowing the useof bromoxynil, Calgene says, its cotton would reduce the croploss to 2% or less while sparing the environment nine millionpounds of chemicals a year -- and saving farmers $40 million.   Bromoxynil is applied at a rate of four to six ounces peracre, a fraction of the one to two pounds per acre forherbicides now used with cotton. The current weedkillersinclude substances that cause birth defects in laboratoryanimals and carcinogens that can leach into ground water.Calgene says bromoxynil is &quot;environmentally safe&quot; because itbegins to break down in soil after five days and doesn'tpollute ground water.   But bromoxynil's health impact is still unclear. Two yearsago, after studies showing it causes mutations and birthdefects in laboratory animals, the EPA banned the use of themost potent form of the herbicide. One Canadian study foundthat bromoxynil accumulates in farmers' bodies; the EPA hasrequired further tests to ensure it doesn't harm thosehandling the herbicide. A University of Missouri study ranksbromoxynil as &quot;highly toxic&quot; to bluegill fish, and &quot;extremelytoxic&quot; to channel catfish.   Rebecca Goldburg, a scientist with the EnvironmentalDefense Fund, criticizes Calgene for encouraging the use of asubstance known to cause such birth defects as extra ribs inrats. If the company were truly interested in promoting theuse of safer herbicides, she says, there are many betterchoices than bromoxynil, such as glyphosate, sold by Monsantounder the brand name Roundup.   Steve Schmotzer, vice president of regulatory and publicaffairs for Rhone-Poulenc's U.S. unit, says new studiessubmitted to the EPA show those who handle the herbicide aresafe. &quot;If properly managed, {bromoxynil} won't result in fishkills,&quot; he adds. The EPA says it will release its evaluationof the new data later this year.   Weed specialists disagree on how the new plants willaffect the amount of herbicides used. But many believe theycould worsen weed problems in the U.S., where 100 weeds havealready developed resistance to herbicides. In Britain andAustralia, some weeds have developed the ability tometabolize most chemical poisons, leaving farmers in thelurch. &quot;This could help create megaweeds,&quot; says Jack Dekker,chairman of the Weed Science Society of America'sherbicide-resistant weed committee.   Other methods hold more long-term promise, some studiessuggest. A 1989 National Research Council report indicatedthat farmers can reduce chemical use without a loss in yieldif they use innovative methods, including certain tillage andcrop-rotation strategies. A Natural Resources Defense Councilreport recently estimated that Iowa corn farmers could cutherbicide use 50% this way.   Bruce D. Maxwell, assistant professor of weed ecology atthe University of Minnesota, warns, &quot;Herbicide-tolerantplants are the quick-fix approach all over again.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
