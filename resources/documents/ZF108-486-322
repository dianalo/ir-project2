 (If you have othercandidates, I would like to hear from you.andP;  Send them to me and I willsummarize them in a future column.)andP;  Since graphics applications have been inthe forefront of personal computing, I attended SIGGRAPH'89, the 1989Conference of ACM's Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics, hoping for apeek at tomorrow's PC.andM;The keynote speaker was Nicholas Negroponte, Director of the MIT Media Lab,who obliged me by looking 25 years into the future.andP;  His presentation wasentitled &quot;From Bezel to Proscenium,&quot; which sent me from my notebook to mydictionary where I discovered that the proscenium is the front part of astage.andP;  Negroponte thinks today's desktop metaphor will give way to the stagemetaphor.andP;  The emphasis in user interfaces will shift from the directmanipulation of objects on a virtual desktop to the delegation of tasks tothree-dimensional, intelligent agents parading across our desks.andM;Negroponte predicts that these agents will be rendered holographically, andwe will communicate with them using many channels, including speech andnon-speech audio, gesture, and facial expression.andP;  He predicts breakthroughsin speech input/output during the next five years and machine vision afterthat.andP;  His talk reminded me of the scene from the movie 2001: A SpaceOdyssey,andM;which a computer eavesdrops on a conversation by reading lips.andP;  Negroponteenvisions agents executing tasks, filtering information, andintercommunicating in our interest.andP;  They will be characters of our choiceand design, with skills, scripts, and personalities.andP;  They will model peopleas well as the physical world.andP;  For example, an agent should know thedifference between a wink to your spouse and to a stranger, and if you getabusive, it may tell you to &quot;smile when you say that.&quot;andM;One could reasonably ask whether Negroponte's vision is valid (we do notcontrol automobiles the way we controlled horses, why communicate withcomputers the way we communicate with people) or feasible, but it isundeniably provocative.andP;  He chided the audience, telling them to shift theirattention from the problem of rendering a perfectly realistic teapot whichbehaves in accordance with physical laws to user interfaces.andP;  Negroponte'sinterfaces, however, will require realistic people and scenes.andM;RealismandM;Steps in the direction of enhanced realism were presented in conferencesessions.andP;  For example, Jean-Paul Gourret, Nadia Magnenat Thalmann, andDaniel Thalman presented a paper on physical and graphical modeling of theinteraction between the shape and skin of a hand while grasping and touchingobjects.andP;  Realistic facial animation, to show emotion and synchronize voiceand lip movement, is also coming along nicely.andP;  Demetri Terzopoulos presentedmodels of skin and facial muscles which could be manipulated to getsurprisingly realistic animation of facial expressions.andM;At the Silicon Graphics booth in the commercial exhibit area, attendees couldinteract with &quot;Mike the Talking Head,&quot; an interactive, facial animationdemonstration developed on a Silicon Graphics workstation.andM;If you do not happen to have a Silicon Graphics workstation, but you wouldlike to experiment with rudimentary facial animation, take a look at BrightStar Technology's HyperAnimator for the Macintosh.andP;  With HyperAnimator, youcreate passport-photo-sized pictures of faces, which move their lips insynchronization with synthesized speech.andM;The spoken words are generated by a speech-to-text algorithm, and theanimation is achieved by rapidly switching the drawings of the face (seeFigure 2).andP;  The drawing displayed depends on the phoneme being uttered.andP;  Tocreate an animated character, you must draw or scan a basic face, and thenmodify it by drawing 16 unique mouths.andP;  The program automatically switchesthe drawings to match the text being spoken, but you have to draw the mouths.andM;In a couple hours of playing with the program, I was able to draw reasonablemouths on a cartoon character, but it was tedious, I was unable to drawrealistic mouths on a scanned photo of a face.andP;  For those who really hatedrawing, the program comes with a cast of canned characters andfacial-feature clip art.andP;  HyperAnimator does not approach the realism ofexperimental programs based on physical simulation, but it illustrates theidea and is available for a personal computer today.andM;Negroponte's interface will also require machine vision for input of facialand body gestures, and the rudiments were displayed at SIGGRAPH'89.andP;  Forexample, there was a game in which a PC with a video camera input &quot;watched&quot;the body movements of the user.andP;  The computer displayed the outline of theuser's body superimposed on a graphic representation of a hockey rink,simulating a hockey match with the user as goalie.andP;  The user watched thesimulation on a monitor and moved his or her hands in an attempt to block&quot;pucks&quot; as they flew toward the goal.andP;  In another application with the samehardware, the user &quot;played&quot; a virtual musical instrument by moving his or herhands.andP;  Such experiments in machine vision, in which the computer tracks theposition of the user's body or hands to control a virtual environment, werepioneered by Myron Krueger of Artificial Reality Corporation.andP;  A PC withvideo input is powerful enough to recognize rough gesture and body movementin real time.andP;  Krueger has published descriptions of his work, and he marketsvideo tapes of his experiments.andP;  You might want to contact him for ideas orinspiration.andM;Until machine vision is perfected, researchers are experimenting withmovement and gesture for control of virtual environments with the aid ofspecial clothing.andP;  An update on this work was presented in a session onVirtual Environments and Interactivity.andP;  Participants showed tapes anddiscussed control of virtual environments by people wearing sensor-coveredclothing, gloves, and head-mounted displays, and using force-feedback joysticks.andP;  One participant, Allison Druin of Tell Tale Technologies, hasdeveloped systems for children in which they touch their clothing, toys, andpicture books to control a computer.andM;Attendees had a chance to interact with a virtual environment at the Autodeskbooth.andP;  Autodesk's primary product is the Autocad CAD program, and they areinterested in eventually allowing users to &quot;move&quot; through three-dimensionalAutocad drawings.andP;  They demonstrated a prototype &quot;Cyberspace&quot; system in whichyou wear a sensor-equipped Data Glove from VPL Research and a head-mounteddisplay which shows a stereoscopic image on LCD panels.andP;  These devices wereconnected to a 386-based PC with a Matrox video board for each side of thedisplay.andP;  The system was nearly fast enough to create the illusion ofrealtime movement in a simulated wireframe racquetball game.andP;  The people atAutodesk said they would be selling a Cyberspace system in about a year, butI will be surprised if they do.andM;Work with Data Gloves, special clothing, and head-mounted displays isinteresting, but in the long run, I hope Negroponte turns out to be right.andP;  Iwould like my computer to watch me optically.andP;  Sensor-covered clothing andData Gloves are cumbersome, and today's head-mounted displays areuncomfortable and it has been documented that it can cause vertigo.andM;AnimationandM;Autodesk introduced Animator, an animation program at SIGGRAPH.andP;  There areseveral animation programs for the Macintosh, but the IBM platform has laggedbehind; so Autodesk Animator may be significant.andP;  I only saw a demonstrationin a hotel room, but the program seems versatile and efficient.andP;  It hasdrawing tools, image import capability, many special effects and fades, andautomatic generation of animation between key frames.andP;  File sizes depend onmany factors such as the number of colors used, image complexity, andplayback rate, but I was told their five-minute, animated demo only required28 MB of disk.andP;  They also feel that, in most cases, a 286-based PC with afast disk drive could sustain a throughput rate of 30 frames per second.andM;I assume Animator was first developed to animate CAD drawings, but Autodeskhopes it will appeal to people making general corporate presentations andeven home animators.andP;  Even if you do not produce Fantasia II, you might wantto add a logo or some explanatory animation to a home or corporate video.andO;For animation to catch on with amateur users at home or the office, it mustbe simple.andM;One complex path to the simplification of animation is physically basedmodeling.andP;  If an animation program &quot;knows&quot; the laws of physics and thecharacteristics of and constraints on the objects being depicted, portions oftheir movement may be automated by simulation.andP;  Professional animators mayhave the skill and patience to create frame-by-frame animations, but amateursdo not.andP;  We need shortcuts such as saying &quot;make character X smile,&quot; &quot;makecharacter X walk from point A to point B,&quot; or &quot;let the vase fall off thetable and break&quot; and having the animation automatically generated.andP;  We wantthe computer to work out animation details as well as lighting effects.andP;  Itwill not happen next week, but the groundwork was foreshadowed in severalpapers and panel sessions at SIGGRAPH.andM;While waiting for the ultimate in physically based modeling, you might wantto explore Knowledge Revolution's Interactive Physics, a Macintosh program inwhich you use drawing tools to create a two-dimensional micro world (seeFigure 3).andP;  The world you draw contains round andpolygonal objects which havemass.andP;  They interact with each other and with massless objects such assprings and ropes, in accordance with the laws of classical physics.andP;  Inaddition to mass, both balls and polygons have initial velocity and rotation,elasticity, and surface friction.andP;  Massless objects also have adjustableproperties such as spring tension and rope elasticity.andP;  Finally, you canadjust the parameters of the world itself, for example, reducing gravity andair resistance to moon levels or turning them off altogether.andM;When your world is drawn, you click on &quot;run,&quot; and the animation begins.andP;  Youcan stop the animation and change parameters or object positions whenever youwish, and each frame is recorded.andP;  After a run, you can play the animationbackward or forward or step single frames by using a scroll bar.andM;Another interesting feature is the ability to associate meters with massobjects.andP;  There are meters for position, velocity, accelaration, momentum,and other dynamic properties of objects.andP;  A meter is created with one menuselection, and a single mouse click can shift it from a digital readout to ananalog dial or a strip chart.andM;This is not a general-purpose animation program, but within its domain,animation is completely painless.andP;  It was designed for physics education, notautomatic animation, but is a good example of both.andP;  The program is notperfect of course.andP;  If you choose too large a time step, errors occur, andthings which should be exactly equal are slightly off.andP;  That would beconfusing to a student testing a hypothesis.andP;  I also had a few user interfacesquabbles, but the biggest problem is the price tag of $249 for singlecopies, with steep quantity discounts for school districts.andM;PhotorealismandM;There were other sessions and exhibits foreshadowing tomorrow's personalcomputer.andP;  There was hardware (parallel pixel processing) and algorithms tospeed realistic rendering of trees, eroded landscapes, plant growth, shadows,trimmed surfaces, and textures.andP;  For example, Carlo H. Segun and Eliot Smyrlpresented a paper entitled &quot;Parameterized Ray Tracing.&quot;andP;  Ray tracing is atechnique for rendering scenes with realistic shadows, reflections, and otherlighting phenomena.andP;  The pictures look great, but depending on computerspeed, image resolution, and complexity, ray tracing can take several minutesor hours.andP;  With parameterized ray tracing, the first pass takes about 10-15percent longer than conventional techniques, but information is saved so theeffect of subsequent parameter variations (for example changing the color orintensity of light sources) can be computed in a few seconds.andP;  Parameterizedray tracing is fast enough to allow for interactive experimentation.andM;Photorealism was also the theme of an orchestrated groundswell of enthusiasmfor Pixar's RenderMan.andP;  According to co-designer Pat Hanrahan, &quot;RenderMan ismeant to be the PostScript of 3-D graphics.andP;  Just as PostScript allows adesktop publishing system to pass page representations to a printer,RenderMan allows three-dimensional modeling systems to pass scenedescriptions to a renderer.&quot;andP;  RenderMan is an interface that separatesmodeling and rendering programs, which have previously been grouped together(see Figure 4).andM;In modeling, you define objects and position them in a scene along with lightsources and a camera.andP;  Once the scene is modeled, it is rendered, creating arealistic image.andP;  Rendering includes eliminating hidden surfaces, accountingfor the colors of light sources and surfaces, position and orientation ofsurfaces relative to the light, roughness of the surface, and atmosphericeffects.andP;  It also requires computing a projection on the viewing plane, depthof field effects, and matching the image to the resolution of the display.andM;Today, RenderMan is implemented as a library of procedures in the C language.andO;For example, Figure 5 is a program using RenderMan procedures to display agreenish-blue square, tilted and moved away from the viewer.andP;  Of course, PCpeople are lazy.andP;  We want an easy-to-use modeling interface and a lightningfast rendering display.andP;  We do not want to write programs using RenderManfunctions any more than we want to write PostScript programs; we use programswhich emit PostScript for us.andM;Pixar's comparison of RenderMan and PostScript is fair.andP;  They were bothintroduced at SIGGRAPH, offered as open standards, made independent outputengines possible, and provided generality, but required a lot of computingresources.andP;  Both were championed and financially backed by Steve Jobs ofApple and NeXT.andP;  Still, RenderMan is not a shoe-in success.andP;  PostScript faceddown several challenges while waiting for hardware to catch up, and I imagineRenderMan will also.andP;  The ultimate determinant of its significance will beuser demand.andP;  Is there widespread demand for photorealistic images?andM;Pixar is lining up allies.andP;  Twenty-five software companies including CADheavies CADKEY and AutoDesk have announced RenderMan support, and Intel isdeveloping a RenderMan display board based on using the i860 microprocessor.andO;Yes, even IBM has announced support for RenderMan.andP;  Today, if you walk into acomputer store and ask for a display board, they will ask if you want EGA orVGA.andP;  If all goes well, in a few years they may ask whether you wantRenderMan compatibility.andM;Art Meets ScienceandM;No SIGGRAPH report would be complete without mentioning the animated ComputerGraphics Theater and the Art Show.andP;  This was the best computer art shown Ihave seen.andP;  The pieces were complete compositions, not isolated objects.andP;  Ilooked back at an early collection of computer art compiled by Ruth Leavitt(in which I had a piece), and it seemed totally incomplete by comparison.andO;Perhaps artists are beginning to make computer art instead of programmers asshown in Figure 6.andM;The show catalog was a special issue of Leonardo, the Journal of theInternational Society for the Arts, Sciences and Technology.andP;  The catalog is126 pages, 50 of which are high-quality color prints of works from the show.andO;The rest of the issue consists of 14 engaging articles.andP;  Essays by arthistorians place today's computer art in context, describing the transitionfrom Renaissance perspective to luminously rendered, geometrically modeledscenes.andP;  Other articles, including one by Benoit Mandelbrot, describe theintersection between science (for example, scientific visualization, imageprocessing, and infinite-resolution fractals) and art.andM;In addition to using a computer to help paint or draw, artists are generatingimages with procedures such as simulations or simple cellular automata.andM;All of the essays were not theoretical.andP;  They also covered practical topicssuch as the effect of exact digital reproducibility on art markets (what isthe value of the Mona Lisa if you can easily make an exact copy of it or theprocedure that generated it) and whether it is better for an art departmentto have 10 cheap computers or one expensive one.andP;  If you are interested incomputer art, you would probably enjoy this catalog as much as I did.andM;The Computer Graphics Theater showcased 44 animated films selected from over300 submissions.andP;  Nearly 30 minutes were 3-D films, viewed with polarizedglasses.andP;  These films get better every year.andP;  Some show technique, likeArthur Schwartzberg's visual haiku &quot;Breeze,&quot; in which a lace curtain fluttersby a vase of flowers.andP;  There were spectacular scientific visualizationanimations of developing storms, ocular surgery and angioplasty,mandala-fantasy films, and films that tell stories, like Pixar's Knicknack, astory with &quot;Not just one or two, but three full Cartesian dimensions!andP;  Notjust two or three, but nine heartwarming characters!andP;  Not just three or four,but all the known human emotions!&quot;andP;  Knicknack is not only an engagingcartoon, it is a showcase for RenderMan.andM;If You Missed ItandM;All is not lost if you missed this conference.andP;  You can still order copies ofthe proceedings and video tapes of the Computer Graphics Theater.andO;Unfortunately, there are no compendium tapes of the demonstrations shownduring the paper and panel sessions.andP;  Such a tape would be a valuable recordof the conference.andP;  For now, you would have to contact the authorsindividually.andP;  Slide sets and the catalog from the Art Show are alsoavailable.andP;  The proceedings, slide sets and catalogs are available by calling1-800-342-6626 (Waverly Press), or if in Maryland, 301-528-4261.andP;  After March15th, the video tapes will be available by calling 1-800-223-5503 or (outsidethe U.S.) 708-250-0807.andM;Larry Press welcomes comments from readers.andP;  He can be reached through thefollowing address, phone number or e-mail address: 10726 Esther Avenue LosAngeles, CA 90064 (213)475-6515 LPRESS@venera.isi.eduandM;SIGGRAPH members will receive transcripts of the panel sessions in anupcoming issue of the SIG newsletter.andM;POINTERSandM;Foley, J., Interfaces for advanced computing.andP;
