<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-62-0417 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors describe a technique for digital fluorography developed fromcommercially available digital subtraction angiography equipment (PhilipsDVI-V with 14-inch image intensifier). The rapid acquisition of digitalimages with instantaneous retrieval and review makes this technique idealfor spot-film fluorography, and the system flexibility indicates a potentialfor widespread applications, when in a more developed form. The authorsdescribe a clinical evaluation of the system used in upper gastrointestinaltract barium examinations. The logistic advantages of the system resultin improved patient throughput, and rapid review improves control overdynamic examinations. Current limitations of matrix size can be significantlyreduced with image processing.</TEXT></DOC>
