After initial anxiety following the Red Army's withdrawal andthe guerrillas' Jalalabad offensive, President Najib's governmentis displaying a new optimism in its ability to stand alone againstthe mujahedeen guerrillas.   Western countries had predicted the mujahedeen, or Islamic holywarriors, would overwhelm the Afghan armed forces within weeks orat least a few months of the Soviets' departure on Feb. 15.   Although these predictions have not come true, the United Stateshas rebuffed proposals by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev fora mutual cut-off of weapons and stepped-up efforts for a cease-fire.   ``They say, `We should give the mujahedeen more time,' but theyhave had time and they have nothing to show. They have no power.They can only fire rockets,'' Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said.   He said President Bush should accept that the guerrillas willnot bring down the Soviet-backed government and that a negotiatedpeace is the only policy consistent with the principles espoused bythe United States.   The guerrilla attack on Jalalabad, which Kabul claims wasorchestrated by neighboring Pakistan's top military and civilianofficials, was based on the assumption that Afghanistan'sfifth-largest city would fall quickly, clearing the way for a pushon Kabul.   But government forces defending Jalalabad have proved theirmorale was not sapped by the Soviet withdrawal. And the mujahedeenhave not yet shown themselves capable of transforming fromhit-and-run fighters to a cohesive force able to mount aconventional assault on a heavily defended city.   The guerrillas' failure to capture Jalalabad and other majorcities appears to have strengthened feelings among governmenttroops that the war has become a do-or-die affair.   ``As long as the Russians were here, there was confusion amongthe people about what we were fighting for,'' a 30-year-old soldierin Jalalabad said recently. ``Now we know. We are fighting asAfghans, and the fighting is for our future.''   After failing for nine years to win the war with 115,000soldiers and a mighty modern arsenal, the Kremlin now professes adesire to play peacemaker. It has called for a broad-basedgovernment in which Najib's Soviet-style party would play a role _but not the only role.   Yuli Vorontsov, the Soviet ambassador, predicted the militarystalemate and increasing diplomatic pressure will oblige the UnitedStates to begin talks on ending the bloodshed.   More than 1.3 million Afghans _ nearly one-tenth of thecountry's pre-war population of 15 million _ have been killed.Another 5 million have fled across the borders to Pakistan and Iran.   ``By the end of summer, I think there will be a change of mind,a change of this policy of `give war a chance,' '' Vorontsov said.   Many foreign diplomats in Kabul, including from nations friendlyto the West, also said they believe the United States will feelincreasing pressure for a settlement.   China already has promised Moscow it will halt arms supplies tothe guerrillas when current contracts expire, Chinese and Sovietdiplomats said on condition of anonymity.   And on Sunday, Najib offered a dozen guerrilla field commandersfull autonomy in their regions if they stop fighting the governmentand help end the 11-year-old civil war.   Iran, anxious to repatriate its 2 million Afghan refugees, alsoappears to be shifting toward a negotiated peace. That leaves onlythe United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia _ the guerrillas'other major backers _ committed to ending the fighting.   A diplomat from a non-communist, pro-Western nation said:``Najib has proven he is tough, organized and that he won't run.The longer the Western countries try to ignore him, the strongerthey're going to allow him to become. In two or three months' time,he could well be a hero.''   A common preference for a settlement seems to rest with anill-defined compromise: a government that is neither as ruthless asthe ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan has been sinceit seized power in 1978, nor as committed to Islamic fundamentalismas some of the most powerful guerrilla groups are.   Events of the last decade have provided little nourishment formiddle-of-the-road politics and seem to leave the task of finding acompromise up to those on the outside, such as the United Nationsor the superpowers.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Sharon Herbaugh, news editor for The AssociatedPress in New Delhi, covered the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistanand has reported extensively from the country since.</TEXT></DOC>
