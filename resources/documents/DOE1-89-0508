Crop growing in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemispherecould be totally destroyed or production severely reduced for at leastthe first growing season after a nuclear exchange, if the resulting atmosphericperturbations were to cause temperature decreases on the order of 5 to15{degree}C for even short periods of time. Other conclusions were: Animalcontributions to human food would be worthless for some period. Radioactivefallout could result in severe contamination of some areas and impairnormal farming operations. Destruction of dams and disruptions of electricitysupplies in a nuclear exchange could remove large areas of irrigatedagricultural land from production for many years and greatly reduce postwaragricultural productivity. Destruction of the complex agricultural infrastructurewould likely result in total elimination of food supplies to a majorportion of the survivors of a nuclear exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
