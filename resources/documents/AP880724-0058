Newspapers reported the shellingof a Pakistani border village.   Pakistani daily newspapers reported Sunday that six people werekilled and 21 injured when the Afghan army shelled the bordervillage of Chaman, in southwestern Pakistan, on Saturday.   One newspaper report said the Pakistani army returned fire. ThePakistani government made no immediate comment on that report.   No immediate word of casualties was given after Sunday's rocketattack on Kabul, blamed on anti-government guerrillas.   The diplomat's report followed near-daily rocket attacks blamedon the guerrillas. During the past three weeks, 130 rockets haveblasted the capital, killing 80 people and injuring more than 100,state-run Radio Kabul said Sunday.   The latest attack also came after Pakistan accused the SovietUnion of bringing troops back into Afghanistan to shore upstruggling government forces around Kabul. The Soviets have agreedto withdraw all of their estimated 115,000 troops by Feb. 15,leaving 50,000 government soldiers to fight about 200,000Pakistani-backed guerrillas.   The Western diplomat in Pakistan, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, also said at least four people died in a late-nightrocket attack on Kabul Friday.   During an address on Radio Kabul on Sunday to mark the Islamicholiday of Eid al-Adha, Afghan President Najib said another rocketattack Saturday killed several people.   He blamed the attack on Afghan guerrillas who have been fightingthe communist government in Kabul for the past 10 years.   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, also reported four peoplewere killed and nine injured when rockets blasted the eastern cityof Jalalabad on Friday.   Chaman, where Pakistan newspapers reported the shelling, liesabout five miles from the Afghan town of Spinbuldak, which rebelshad surrounding.   Quoting official sources, a Pakistani opposition paper, TheFrontier Post, said Pakistan army troops returned fire.   Najib said the Soviet troop withdrawal, provided for in anaccord in April, was progressing, but he said stepped-up guerrillaattacks were ``obstructing'' it. He did not elaborate.   The Soviet Union denied Pakistani President Zia ul-Haq's chargethat the troop withdrawal had stopped and 10,000 soldiers wererecalled from the Soviet Union to prop up the defense of Kabul,Radio Kabul said.   Quoting Soviet Chief of Staff Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, RadioKabul said Sunday that 35,000 troops have left Afghanistan.Akhromeyev said half of an estimated 115,000 troops will be out byAug. 15.   Meanwhile, another Soviet military officer, breaking withMoscow's official line, said he doubted the Afghan army can surviveafter Soviet troops leave. He predicted Islamic fundamentalistswill gain power.   Maj. Gen. Kim M. Tsagolov, who served as a Soviet adviser toAfghan troops, also told the weekly Ogonyok magazine in its July 30issue that Afghanistan's governing party is hopelessly disorganizedand has bungled opportunities to make peace with insurgents.</TEXT></DOC>
