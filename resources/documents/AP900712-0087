(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state appeals court today unanimouslyupheld Gov. Mario Cuomo's agreement to have the state buy theShoreham nuclear power plant for $1 and dismantle it.   The 5-0 decision from the Appellate Division of state SupremeCourt upheld two lower court rulings in Cuomo's favor.   The Shoreham plant, built at a cost of more than $5.5 billion,has never operated at anything above low-level test power. Theplant, located in Suffolk County on Long Island, was built by theLong Island Lighting Company and brought the company to the brinkof bankruptcy.   Cuomo argued that Shoreham was unsafe to operate because itslocation on a heavily populated island made an emergency evacuationimpractical. Cuomo reached the agreement with LILCO to scrap theplant in 1989.   ``Our decision is not meant to be a judgment on any party'sposition regarding nuclear-generated power generally or Shorehamspecifically,'' said the appeals court in an unsigned opinion. ``Itis simply an assessment of the authority granted by the Legislatureand how that authority has been exercised.''   Martin Kaufman, a lawyer for the Atlantic Legal Foundation, saidhe wasn't yet certain whether his group would attempt to appeal theruling to New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals.   The foundation, a conservative-oriented organization, had beenjoined in the lawsuit by the U.S. Justice Department and othersupporters of not abandoning Shoreham.   ``Obviously, this loss is not helpful,'' said Kaufman.</TEXT></DOC>
