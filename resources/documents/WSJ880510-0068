The Japan Automobile Dealers Association said yesterday that domestic sales of cars, trucks and buses increased 21% in April from a year earlier, to 393,091 units, marking the fifth consecutive monthly record.    In 1988's first four months, sales totaled 1.7 million units, up 17% from the year before. Although the association hasn't revised its projection that Japanese and foreign auto makers will sell 4.2 million vehicles in Japan this year -- which would be down from last year's record 4.3 million units -- the industry officials said sales are likely to exceed that figure.    Japanese consumer spending has been increasing at a healthy clip. The officials said consumption has been spurred by increases in stock prices and the value of fixed assets. Some added that because steep real-estate prices have prevented many families from buying houses, the families are purchasing cars instead. Analysts also cited the introduction of new car models and noted that truck demand has increased because of the Tokyo government's large public-works outlays. </TEXT></DOC>
