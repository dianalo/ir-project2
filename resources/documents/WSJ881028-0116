Selland president of its Aeroquip Corp. subsidiary in an expansion of his responsibilities.    Mr. Selland, 45 years old, is and will remain president of Trinova's Sterling Engineered Products Inc. subsidiary.    Sterling and Aeroquip will retain their separate subsidiary relationships with Trinova, the company said. But this is the first time that one executive will have the top executive post at both units.    The two subsidiaries &quot;share a common business culture in that they both are components businesses that serve a variety of similar-type customers and markets around the world,&quot; said Darryl F. Allen, Trinova's president and chief executive officer, in a prepared statement.    Sterling is a maker of custom-engineered molded plastic products, surfacing materials and specialty resins. Aeroquip produces hoses and fittings for fluid-power applications in many of the same industries as Sterling, including automotive.    Trinova also elected Mr. Selland and James McKee, 57, president of Trinova's Vickers Inc. subsidiary, to the newly created post of executive vice president. Both had been corporate vice presidents.
