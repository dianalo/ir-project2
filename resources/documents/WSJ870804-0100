Between 1960 and 1970, inflation-adjusted median family income increased 34% to $27,900 (in 1986 dollars). But despite several growth years, by 1982 median family income had declined to $26,600, about the same as it was in 1967.    The latest Census Bureau income report shows a turnaround. Median family income in 1986 was nearly $29,500, up 4% over the previous year, and 11% above 1982. The highest family income ($38,900) was in the 45-to-54-year age group. The lowest income ($15,000) was found in the youngest families, where the head of household was under age 25. That group has had either very low or negative real income growth for most of this decade.    One reason why overall median family income is rising so fast is that the number of low-income young families is declining while the number of high-income middle-aged families is growing. The Census Bureau expects the number of families to increase about 10% between 1987 and 1997, but expects the number of families in the 45-to-54 age group to jump 50%.    This suggests that unless the inflation of the 1970s returns, the rapid growth in real income should continue for the remainder of the decade and into the 1990s, fueling consumer spending and long-term economic growth.    Long-Term Blues   With family incomes rising, people would likely be optimistic about their financial condition. That appears to be true for the short term -- but not the long term.    In a national survey sponsored by the International Association of Financial Planners, 58% of all respondents and 79% of those from upper-income households said it was relatively easy in 1986 to manage their finances. Nearly one-fifth said they had no real financial concerns for the rest of 1987. The biggest short-term financial concerns of upper-income people were paying for children's education (19% of respondents) and paying taxes (14%).    But this same survey also found a high degree of dissatisfaction with current net worth. More than half of all respondents and 47% of those earning more than $50,000 a year said their current net worth wasn't as high as it should be.    Upper-income people are also worried about not having enough money for their retirement. Nearly one-half of the women and one-third of the men whose household income exceeds $50,000 a year say they are concerned about outliving their retirement savings.    Almost half of the respondents also see fewer financial opportunities for the next generation. As reasons, they cite a lack of jobs (21%), the unbalanced federal budget (18%), and the trade deficit (14%).    This long-term pessimism suggests that as real family income increases, people may save or invest more. The reason: to hedge against what they perceive to be future bad times and to increase their net worth.    Falling Taxes   Perhaps one reason the Financial Planners Association survey found only 14% of upper-income households concerned about paying their taxes is that the average taxes paid as a percentage of household income have been dropping sharply for some households since 1980.    For households with an annual pretax income of $75,000 or more, average federal, state and local taxes declined from 41.3% of pretax income in 1980 to 32.4% in 1985. The average household paid 22.2% of its income in taxes in 1985, down from 23.1% in 1980.    Only one income category ended up paying more taxes at the end of the five-year period. Probably because of increased Social Security withholding taxes, households with less than $10,000 pretax earnings paid 10.8% of their income in taxes in 1985, up from 9.1% in 1980. The statistics come from a recent Census Bureau study of household income, which included taxpayer statistics from the Internal Revenue Service.    The study also examined tax burdens in relation to household age. The youngest householders (under age 25) pay only 18% of their income in taxes. Both the amount of taxes paid and the percentage rise until age 45, when the average tax load is nearly 25% of income. Middle-aged householders (age 45 to 49) pay the most, while householders aged 65 and older pay the least, only 14% of their income.    This tabulation of tax bite by age suggests that as the baby boom moves into middle age, not only will their income increase but so will their tax burden. Any attempt to raise tax rates will probably encounter the most opposition from baby boomers who represent 40% of registered voters. </TEXT></DOC>
