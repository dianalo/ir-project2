The new reporting system consistsof an annual report of program outcomes and worker characteristics anda quarterly financial report of funding availability and expenditures.These reports are designed to collect information that will permit theDepartment (1) to set transitional substate performance standards and forfuture standards management; (2) to provide adjusted substate standardsfor varying types of retraining thus enabling States to award incentivesfor long-term training; (3) to calculate reallotments and provide for financialreconciliation; (4) to meet Federal responsibilities for program administration,management and oversight; and (5) to respond to public and Congressionalrequests for information on implementation of the new EDWAA program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> July 1, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, CONTACT:</T2> Karen Greene, Telephone (202)535-0680.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Supplementary Information:</T2> On December 13, 1988, the Departmentpublished proposed new reporting requirements for the Economic Dislocationand Worker Adjustment Assistance (EDWAA) program in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> at 53 FR 50117. Interested parties were invitedto submit written comments through January 13, 1989. At the same time,the proposed reporting requirements were forwarded to the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) for review pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Based on comments received, the proposed reporting forms and instructionshave been revised to streamline both the annual and quarterly reports,retaining the most critical data elements needed for performance standards,program management and Federal oversight. Further, to the extent possible,reporting requirements and definitions were revised to permit flexibilityand to promote coordination of service delivery from multiple programs.The final report forms and instructions are being published in this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice for implementation with the EDWAA programbeginning in Program Year 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">A. Authority and Purpose of the Worker Adjustment Program ReportingRequirements </ITAG>Periodic reporting of activity under EDWAA is necessary to comply withthe provisions of JTPA cited below regarding the Secretary's responsibilitiesand authority for setting performance standards and for program managementand Federal oversight. andbullet; <T3>Section 106_Performance standards.</T3> This section directs the Secretaryto prescribe standards for dislocated worker programs under Title III.New provisions amending paragraph (e) of this section direct the Secretaryto establish parameters within which Governors may vary standards for substategrantees based on local economic factors, characteristics of the populationto be served, and types of services to be provided. Section 106(g)(2) furtherrequires an adjustment in performance standards to account for the differencein costs resulting from serving workers receiving needs-related payments.andbullet; <T3>Section 165_Reports, recordkeeping and investigations.</T3> This sectionrequires States and substate grantees to maintain records and report informationregarding program performance and fiscal management as specified by theSecretary. andbullet; <T3>Section 169_Administrative provisions.</T3> The Secretary is directedat paragraph (d)(1) to submit an annual report to Congress summarizingprogram achievements and problems in meeting statutory objectives and,where appropriate, suggest recommendations for program modifications oradministrative action. andbullet; <T3>Section 303_Reallotment.</T3> This section requires the Secretary toannually reallot an amount of funds equal to unexpended formula funds inexcess of 20 percent of the State's prior year's formula allotment, plusall unexpended formula funds from the year before the prior year. andbullet; <T3>Section 311_Incentives under EDWAA.</T3> Paragraph (a) of this sectionmandates that each State plan include incentives to provide training ofgreater duration for those who require it. andbullet; <T3>Section 315_Limitations on uses of funds.</T3> This section describesrequirements and limitations on expenditures for retraining activities,needs-related payments and supportive services, and administration in EDWAAprograms. andbullet; <T3>Section 322_Federal oversight.</T3> The Secretary is directed at paragraph(a)(4) to monitor performance and expenditures of Title III programs andannually certify compliance with standards prescribed by the Secretaryunder section 106(g).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">These provisions require a new worker adjustment reporting systemto conform to programmatic changes associated with the implementation ofEDWAA. The new reports include (1) quarterly State financial reporting,and (2) expanded annual performance reporting for State, substate, andNational Reserve programs. Justification of this new reporting system isbased on the Federal responsibilities for implementation of the provisionsof EDWAA, recognizing the fact that:andbullet; Quarterly reporting of expenditures is necessary to comply withthe new reallotment requirements, increased Federal oversight responsibility,and budget preparation. It is anticipated that more frequent monitoringwill enable the Department and the States to identify financial managementproblems_especially those associated with the implementation of a new programduring the first two years_and resolve them before year's end to minimizeFederal reallotment actions.andbullet; Data on program performance, participant characteristics, andtypes of services provided must be collected at the substate level in orderto support the establishment of substate standards and adjustments forvarying these standards. Without substate data, objective and defensiblelocal standards cannot be set because the effects on performance of varyingsignificant local conditions cannot be systematically estimated.andbullet; Federal reporting is the most cost effective method for collectingconsistent financial, program activity, and performance information acrossState and substate areas in a timely manner to comply with management andoversight requirements of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Reasons for New Reporting Requirements</ITAG>Existing reporting requirements for Title III have been determined to beinadequate for programs under EDWAA for several reasons:andbullet; The Department anticipates adding new standards in the future_postprogramjob retention, a measure of pre/postprogram wage, and separate placementlevels for programs offering basic readjustment services only as comparedto those providing retraining. Data collection must begin in Program Year1989 for the Secretary and Governors to have adequate information to setand adjust these standards no later than PY 1992.andbullet; Reporting of training duration and completions by major area ofretraining specified in the Act will enable the Department to improve itsadjustments to program outcomes by accounting for differences in programintervention and duration. These data will also enable States to establishand implement a system to provide incentives for training of longer duration,as required in the Act.andbullet; New activities and priorities under EDWAA, including significantnew State-level responsibilities for rapid response, must be monitoredby the Department to ensure effective implementation, and will be the subjectof public inquiry and Congressional review.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Discussion of Comments</ITAG>In response to the request for comments included with the December 13 publicationof proposed EDWAA reporting requirements, the Department received 34 lettersfrom States, local areas, and public interest groups. The overriding concernexpressed by a majority of the commenters centered on the magnitude ofthe effort necessary to implement the proposed reporting system when comparedto the size of the program and the level of available resources.The Department acknowledges the burden of establishing a new program, includingthe necessary management information and tracking systems. Although TitleIII provisions have mirrored Title II in the past, EDWAA seeks to focuson specific activities and outcomes for the dislocated worker. To reducethe impact of EDWAA implementation, the Department has streamlined thereporting requirements to capture the more critical data elements neededfor EDWAA performance standards, program management and Federal oversight.Restructuring of both the annual and the quarterly report forms has reducedthe total number of required reporting elements by one-third.Specific comments regarding the proposed requirements for the annual andquarterly reports are addressed in the discussions below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Worker Adjustment Annual Program Report (9019)</ITAG>Certificates of Continuing Eligibility (CCEs)The extent to which this new program feature is utilized by the substategrantees and its impact on the program will be of significant interestto the Department and to Congress. Most of the commenters focused on theburden of tracking CCEs to their ultimate disposition, as required in theinterim-final regulations, especially if they are redeemed by another substategrantee. The EDWAA regulations are being clarified to require that recordsbe kept on those CCEs issued and on those redeemed by the grantee, butthe grantees do not have to track the certificates outside of the substatearea. Since records must be maintained, the reporting burden is minimaland, therefore, these two line items have been retained.<ITAG tagnum="84">Relocated Out of Area</ITAG>The Department concurs with the commenters' observation that informationon the number of placements from retraining who were relocated out of thearea is only a subgroup of total relocations. The purpose of this reportitem, however, is to identify what may be a significant cost (i.e., actualrelocation of a household) that will impact on the level of retrainingexpenditures. Placement in a new job that does not require the expenditureof retraining funds is not at issue. Therefore, this item has been retainedas proposed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Termination Categories</ITAG>Commenters were generally positive about collecting information on thenature of the services that resulted in placements, and information onthe termination of participants who were not placed in unsubsidized employment.Some commenters sought additional clarification as to how these terminationswill be treated in the calculation of the entered employment rate for performancestandards purposes. The termination of participants who transfer was viewedby others as incompatible with coordination with other programs and theseamless delivery of services. The performance standards provisions havebeen revised to exclude from ``total terminations'' those participantswho have been called back or remained with their employer. Provisions havebeen included in the reporting instructions that allow grantees the opportunityto continue to track participation through concurrent enrollment in otherprograms, such as under a case management-type system, if the servicesare consistent with an initially determined training objective. Final termination,and the outcome achieved as a result of concurrent participation in EDWAA-fundedactivities or any other program, is to be shown on each grantee's report(State, substate or National Reserve) at the conclusion of all activities.Separate reporting of transfers will be retained, however, to encouragecoordination by those grantees which do not have a case management-typecapability.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economically Disadvantaged</ITAG>Commenters took exception to this requirement, citing determination ofeconomically disadvantaged status as excessively burdensome since it requirescollection of information on income and family size, as well as calculationand comparison with published tables. Also, reporting of personal, confidentialinformation was considered to be unjustifiable when not related to programeligibility. Therefore, this requirement has been deleted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Dislocated Worker Eligibility Status</ITAG>Commenters maintained that there is no identifiable connection betweeneligibility categories and performance outcomes due to varying definitionsacross States. Valuable performance standards adjustments such as ``unemployed15 out of 26 weeks'' and ``unemployment compensation claimant'' appearredundant with the less objective eligibility categories. Finally, sinceEDWAA applicants may be eligible under more than one category, the resultingdata may underestimate the numbers in each group. Although it is anticipatedthat service levels to the different eligibility groups will be of considerableCongressional interest, these items have been removed from the final reportform.<ITAG tagnum="84">TRA Claimant</ITAG>A number of commenters noted that since TRA benefits may not be availableuntil after enrollment into EDWAA, this would entail the additional burdenof tracking and updating participant characteristics after the initialeligibility determination. Because collection, and hence reliability ofthe data would be problematic, this line has been deleted from the reportform.<ITAG tagnum="84">Veterans</ITAG>Although one commenter questioned collecting information on Veteran status,pursuant to the ``Veterans Employment, Training, and Counseling Amendmentsof 1988,'' these items have been retained on the final report form.<ITAG tagnum="84">Needs-Related Payments/Recipients</ITAG>Commenters pointed out that while the Act requires taking into accountthe cost of needs-related payments when establishing performance standards,it is not clear that the number of participants who received such paymentswill affect the outcomes. Therefore, the line item for costs of needs-relatedpayments has been retained, while the second line on number of recipientshas been deleted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Pre-Program Average Hourly Wage</ITAG>The calculated average of wages received prior to EDWAA participation wasincluded on the proposed form. While generally supporting the concept,commenters pointed out that:andbullet; This is a complicated item, requiring multiple determinationsand computations.andbullet; The individual's wage within a specific time period may not bean appropriate indicator of the wage at the time of dislocation.andbullet; A limited look back period for pre-program wage will increasethe likelihood of a zero wage for long term unemployed.This line item has been retained, but the instructions have been revisedto allow for an open-ended look back period to more accurately reflectthe dislocation wage, and reduce the chance of a zero pre-program wage.<ITAG tagnum="84">Retraining Duration</ITAG>Commenters took exception to tracking length of stay according to threedifferent time periods because it is unnecessarily burdensome, particularlywhen very little EDWAA retraining activity will last more than 52 weeks.Tracking the duration of retraining will be very important as Governorsestablish incentives to provide longer term training for those who requireit, as directed in the Act. However, to reduce the burden of tracking,only two categories_retraining less than 26 weeks and 26 weeks or more_arenow required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Types of Completed Retraining</ITAG>Commenters noted that the types of retraining listed on the report do notcapture the variety of possible services under retraining. Exclusive useof the term ``classroom training'' sends a signal that this type of formalizedinstruction is the preferred method over other alternatives. Finally, someargued that if acquiring a GED is separately identified, other achievementssuch as certificates or degrees should also be included. ``Classroom training''has been deleted from the line item for occupational skills training toallow for the inclusion of customized training or other appropriate typesof occupational retraining. The acquisition of a GED has been deleted asa separate category and has been included in the basic education category.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section B_Rapid Response</ITAG>The extent of rapid response activity under the Governor's Reserve, whichis a significant part of the EDWAA program, will be of considerable interestto the Department and to Congress. Many commenters pointed out, however,that a report that focuses on participants and outcomes is an inappropriatevehicle for collection of non-participant based activity. Moreover, someobjected to the conclusions that might be drawn from this information.The number of employees affected by a dislocation is no indicator of thequality or the intensity of a rapid response effort. Absence of a labor-managementcommittee may be the result of many factors beyond the control of the State'sdislocated worker unit. And, information on studies relating to a plantpurchase will be of little value. Therefore, the number of WARN noticesreceived and initial rapid response contacts made will be monitored onthe quarterly report as the more appropriate instrument for reporting generallevels of activity.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section C_Secretary's National Reserve</ITAG>A separate section was included on the annual report to show a breakoutof expenditures under the Secretary's National Reserve programs. Commentson this section pointed out that similar types of expenditure informationwas already being requested on the quarterly report, and these items wereinappropriate for a report that focused on participants and outcomes. Therefore,these items are added as an additional column to the revised financialreport.<ITAG tagnum="84">Worker Adjustment Quarterly Financial Report (9020)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Report Submission</ITAG>The proposed reporting instructions required submission of financial reportswithin 30 days after the end of the report period. Commenters questionedwhy the Department was making an exception for this financial report whenother JTPA reports are to be submitted within 45 days after the end ofthe report period. Some commenters suggested that 30 days was insufficientto collect accurate financial data, resulting in many more resubmissionsof revised reports. The quarterly reporting instructions have been modifiedto allow a 45-day submission period. Further, changes to financial datado not require submission of revised first, second or third quarter reports.<ITAG tagnum="84">Year of Fund Source</ITAG>New provisions in EDWAA require reallotment of an amount equal to unexpendedformula funds for the prior year in excess of 20 percent of the prior yearallotment, plus any unexpended funds from the year before the prior year.Commenters pointed out that National Reserve funds are not subject to reallotment,and therefore availability and expenditures should not be reported accordingto the year in which the funds were made available. The final report packagecontinues to include a breakout of National Reserve funds, however, becausethis will allow for the annual reconciliation of both formula and discretionarygrants from this one report without the current necessity for a separateand additionally burdensome report.<ITAG tagnum="84">Program Availability and Expenditures</ITAG>The number of cost categories specified in the regulations has been reducedby combining needs-related payments and supportive services as a singlecategory, reducing the reporting categories by one. Also, the reportinginstructions have been rewritten and clarified with regard to funds reservedby the Governor for distribution to substate grantees in need, eliminatingthe need for proposed separate reporting elements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980</ITAG>The Appendix to this notice has been reviewed in accordance with the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 by the Office of Management and Budget and approvedfor the period through December 31, 1992 (OMB No. 1205-0274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 27 day of February, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Roberts T.

Section III_Follow-up Information Section III displays information based on follow-up data which must becollected through participant contact to determine an individual's laborforce status and earnings, if any, during the 13th full calendar week aftertermination and the number of weeks s/he was employed during the 13-weekperiod. Follow-up data should be collected from participants whose 13thfull calendar week after termination ends during the program year (thefollow-up group). Thus, follow-up will be conducted for individuals whoterminate during the first three quarters of the program year and the lastquarter of the previous program year. For PY89 follow-up may be conducted for individuals who terminate duringthe first three quarters of the program year and postprogram data collectionneed not begin until October 1, 1989. In order to ensure consistency of data collection and to guarantee thequality of the follow-up information, follow-up procedures must satisfycertain criteria.

Respondentsmust be told that responding is voluntary and that information providedby them will be kept confidential. Other questions may be included in theinterview. Attitudinal questions may precede DOL questions, but questionsrelated to employment and earnings must follow.andbullet; Attempts must be made to contact<T3> all</T3> individuals unless terminee populations are large enoughto use sampling.andbullet; At least six attempts may need to be made to contact enough individualsin the follow-up group to obtain the required response rate.andbullet; For each SSA and for Statewide and National Reserve reports (WAPR),minimum response rates of 70% are required for each of the following twogroups of dislocated workers: those who entered employment at terminationand those who did not enter employment at termination.

Those participants who may have been concurrentparticipants in more than one JTPA title/EDWAA program will be in the universefor each.When selecting a sample from the universe, each title/program will be treatedseparately, so that an individual who had been a concurrent participantmight be selected in one sample but not another. This, however, does notpreclude the possibility that the participant might be selected in morethan one sample. In the event that a concurrent participant has been selectedin more than one sample, the responses collected from a single interviewmay be shared among the different titles/programs to avoid the necessityof multiple interviews with the same individual.When an individual who has terminated from one title/program and subsequentlybecomes a participant in another program (i.e., not a concurrent participant)is selected in the sample for both titles/programs, separate interviewsmust be conducted. Further, if an individual is selected in one sampleand is a participant in another title/program at the time of the interview,regular follow-up information should be determined and recorded.Sampling ProceduresWhere sampling is used to obtain participant contact information, it isnecessary to have a system which ensures consistent random selection ofsample participants from <T3>all</T3> terminees in the group requiring follow-up.andbullet; No participant in the follow-up group may be arbitrarily excludedfrom the sample.andbullet; Procedures used to select the sample must conform to generallyaccepted statistical practice, e.g., a table of random numbers or otherrandom selection techniques must be used.andbullet; The sample selected for contact must meet minimum sample sizerequirements indicated in Table 1.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Minimum Sample Sizes for Follow-up </T4><H1>Number of terminees in follow-up population </H1><H1>Minimum sample size </H1><H1>Sampling percentages</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1 to 137 <D>All </D><D>100</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">138 to 149 <D>137 </D><D>94</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">150 to 159 <D>143 </D><D>92</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">160 to 169 <D>149 </D><D>89</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">170 to 179 <D>154 </D><D>87</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">180 to 189 <D>159 </D><D>85</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">190 to 199 <D>164 </D><D>84</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">200 to 224 <D>175 </D><D>82</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">225 to 249 <D>185 </D><D>78</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">250 to 274 <D>194 </D><D>74</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">275 to 299 <D>202 </D><D>71</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">300 to 349 <D>217 </D><D>67</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">350 to 399 <D>229 </D><D>62</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">400 to 449 <D>240 </D><D>57</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">450 to 499 <D>250 </D><D>53</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">550 to 599 <D>265 </D><D>50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">600 to 749 <D>282 </D><D>44</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">750 to 999 <D>302 </D><D>38</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,000 to 1,499 <D>325 </D><D>30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,500 to 1,999 <D>338 </D><D>22</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,000 to 2,999 <D>352 </D><D>17</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3,000 to 4,999 <D>364 </D><D>12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5,000 or more <D>383 </D><D>7.3</D></ITAG></ITAG>The use of sampling will depend on whether the terminee populations arelarge enough to provide estimates which meet minimum statistical standards.If the number of terminees for whom follow-up is required is less than138, sampling cannot be used. In such cases attempts must be made to contactall the appropriate terminees. Minimum Sample Sizes for Follow-upTo determine the minimum number of terminees to be included in the follow-upsample, refer to Table 1 in the following instructions. Find the row inthe left-hand column that contains the planned number of dislocated workerterminees. The required minimum sample size is given in the middle columnof that row. The last column gives sampling percentages that will assurethat the minimum sample size is obtained. Correcting for Differences in Response Rates Different response rates for those terminees who entered employment attermination and those who did not are expected to bias the performanceestimates because those who entered employment at termination are morelikely to be employed at follow-up. It is assumed that those who were employedat termination are easier to locate than those who were unemployed becausethe interviewer has more contact sources (e.g., name of employer). Theresulting response bias can artificially inflate performance results atfollow-up. To account for this problem, separate response rates should be calculatedfor those who were employed at termination and for those who were not.If the response rates of those employed at termination and those not employeddiffer by more than 5 percentage points, then the ``Worksheet for AdjustingFollow-up Performance Measures'' in the Follow-up Technical AssistanceGuide must be used to correct the follow-up measures.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix B_Definition of Terms Necessary for Completion of Reports</ITAG>Employment/Training Services<T3>Assessment</T3>_services are designed to initially determine each participant'semployability, aptitudes, abilities and interests, through interviews,testing and counseling to achieve the applicant's employment related goals.<T3>Follow-up</T3>_is the collection of information on a terminee's employmentsituation at a specified period after termination from the program.<T3>Intake</T3>_includes the screening of an applicant for eligibilityand: (1) A determination of whether the program can benefit the individual;(2) an identification of the employment and training activities and serviceswhich would be appropriate for that individual; (3) a determination ofthe availability of an appropriate employment and training activity; (4)a decision on selection for participation and (5) the dissemination ofinformation on the program.<T3>Outreach</T3>_activity involves the collection, publication and disseminationof information on program services directed toward economically disadvantagedand other individuals eligible to receive JTPA training and support services.Education StatusLess Than High School_An adult or youth: (1) Who is not attending schoolfull-time and has not received a high school diploma or a GED certificate;or (2) who has not received a high school diploma or GED certificate andis enrolled full-time in an elementary, secondary or postsecondary-levelvocational, technical, or academic school or is between school terms andintends to return to school.High School Graduate or equivalent (No Post-High School)_An adult or youthwho has received a high school diploma or GED certificate, but who hasnot attended any postsecondary vocational, technical, or academic school.Post High School Attendee_An adult or youth who has received a high schooldiploma or GED certificate and has attended (or is attending) any postsecondary-levelvocational, technical, or academic school.College Graduate_A terminee who has received a degree (usually a BA orBS) conferred by a four-year college, university or professional schoolor an advanced degree from one of these institutions.Family StatusSingle Head of Household_A single, abandoned, separated, divorced or widowedindividual who has responsibility for one or more dependent children underage 18.Race/Ethnic GroupWhite (not hispanic)_A person having origins in any of the original peoplesof Europe, North Africa, or the Middle East.Black (not hispanic)_A person having origins in any of the black racialgroups of Africa.Hispanic_A person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American,or other Spanish culture or origin (including Spain), regardless of race.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> Among persons from Central and South American countries,only those who are of Spanish origin, descent, or culture should be includedin the Hispanic category.
