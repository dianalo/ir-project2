Our first prototypeallows detection of /sup 32/P emitters on a 26 X 26 cm/sup 2/ surfacewith 1.5 mm and 5 mm resolutions, respectively for X and Y directions,and a 0.3 % efficiency. Improvements, presently under study, in bothfiber qualities and photocathode efficiency should increase the deviceefficiency to 40 % and its resolution up to the optical fiber diameter(500 {mu}m for the time being). Such characteristics would allow SOFIto replace autoradiographic films in biology and make it a convenientposition sensitive detector in nuclear and particle physics.</TEXT></DOC>
