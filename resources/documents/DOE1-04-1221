For the lower energies of 14.0 {similar_to}14.8MeV, the neutron fluence rate was determined by associated {alpha}-particlecounting, while the proton-recoil telescope was used for the higher energiesof 15.2 {similar_to}19.9 MeV. Correction was applied to account for theadditional radioactivity brought by d + D neutrons from deuteron implantationin tritium target. The /sup 24/Na and /sup 56/Mn activities generatedby the reactions of interest were determined using 4{pi}{beta}{gamma}coincidence counter. In respect of the /sup 27/Al(n,{alpha})/sup 24/Nareaction, the present results agree well with the latest evaluationsof Asami and Vonach and with Ryves' measurements, except in the higherenergy regions, and in respect of the /sup 56/Fe(n,p)/sup 56/Mn crosssection, with Ryves' measurements. On the other hand, the ENDF/B-NABLAevaluations deviate appreciably from the present results in respect ofboth reactions, and this applies also to the JENDL-2 evaluations in respectof the /sup 56/Fe(n,p)/sup 56/Mn cross section.</TEXT></DOC>
