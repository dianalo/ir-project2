The primary objective of any geothermal explorationand drilling program is to locate a geothermal reservoir from which energycan be economically extracted. Numerous surface and near-surface geological,hydrological, geochemical, and geophysical techniques are used in geothermalexploration primarily for determining the locations for deep exploratorydrill holes to prove the potential reservoir. However, the ultimate objectiveof any geothermal exploration program, that can only be achieved by drillingdeep exploration wells, is to provide the data which are necessary torecognize, characterize, and delimit the geothermal reservoir and therebyto calibrate and refine the exploration models derived from the geological,hydrological, geochemical and geophysical investigations. Since the fundamentalnature of most known geothermal systems is rather poorly understood,much work remains to be done. The extraordinary differences that existbetween known geothermal reservoirs indicate that continued investigationand research will be rewarding. Nevertheless, the results of effortsto date are already leading to a rapid acceleration in the growth ofthe geothermal industry worldwide.</TEXT></DOC>
