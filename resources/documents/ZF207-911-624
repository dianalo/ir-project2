 400 on Reader Service CardandM;At the rate workstation vendors are going, one would not be surprised to seewristwatch-sized workstations with the power of a Cray before too long.andP;  Andthese workstations would be inexpensive, too.andM;It seems that every few months yet another machine is released that provideseither more MVUPs per square foot or more MIPS for the dollar than previousmodels.andP;  Last month was no exception.andM;Mips Computer Systems has just brought out its first workstation, a machinewith excellent potential.andM;The RS2030 isn't the first workstation to be powered by a 16.67 MHz MipsR2000 RISC CPU; on the contrary, several machines on the market--most notablythe DECstation 3100--use this chip, and the DECstation 2100 and SiliconGraphics' Personal Iris use a slightly slower version of the same chip.andM;What's significant about the RS2030 is its size.andP;  The system unit is only 14by 15 by 3 inches, quite a bit smaller than the enclosures for either theDECstation 3100 or Sun's Sparcstation 1.andM;Of course, what's more important than the size of a machine is itsperformance, and the RS2030 scores well there.andP;  It turned in 14.90 MicroVAXII units of processing (MVUPs) on DR Labs' CPU 2 Fortran benchmark suite,besting even the similarly powered DECstation 3100 (Fig.andP;  1).andP;  Perhaps Mips'RISC/os Unix operating system is better tuned to the platform that DEC'sUltrix (though the DECstation 3100, like the RS2030, uses Mips' own 177Fortran compiler).andM;Couple that CPU performance with an exceptional display screen and awindowing system based on the X Window System, and you have an excellentfoundation for running some powerful applications.andM;The RS2030 is competitively priced against its cousin, the DECstation 3100.andO;A 19-inch color RS2030 workstation with 8MB of memory and a 172MB disk driveis priced at $22,500, whereas a 19-inch color DECstation 3100 with 16MB ofmemory and a 104MB disk drive is $26,300.andP;  (A diskless 19-inc colorDECstation 3100 with 8MB of memory is $17,900.)andM;The entry-level 16-inch color RS2030 workstation with 8MB of memory and a172MB disk drive is priced at $19,500; an equivalent 19-inch monochromeversion is $17,000.andM;The RS2030 has a server model, the RC2030, which is similar to theentry-level RS2030 except that it has no monitor and includes a quarter-inchcartridge tape drive in a separate desktop enclosure.andP;  The RC2030 is pricedat $17,500.andM;ALMOST ALL ON ONE BOARDandM;The RS2030 is implemented on a 14-by-13-inch printed circuit board and anaccompanying video board (Fig.andP;  2).andM;The CPU board contains the CPU itself, the CPU interface components, the mainmemory and an I/O section (Fig.andP;  3).andM;In addition to being powered by a 16MHz R2000 chip, the workstation includesan R2010 floating-point co-processor and 32KB each of instruction and datacaches.andM;The interface section, which links the CPU to the rest of the system,includes four R2020 write-through controllers and the system's videoconnections and performs some low-level I/O functions.andM;The RS2030's main memory is connected to both the CPU subsystem and the I/Oprocessor; however, requests from the CPU have a higher priority than thosefrom the I/O processor.andP;  The RS2030 supports a minimum of 8MB of main memory,expandable to 16MB.andM;The trend in workstations has been to incorporate as many I/O elements aspossible directly on the main CPU board; the rS2030 is no exception.andP;  The I/Osection of the main board includes an NEC V50 I/O processor; controllers forEthernet and SCSI connections, the keyboard, a serial line and floppy drives;and a clock/calendar chip.andM;The NEC V50 is a self-contained 16-bit microprocessor that relieves the CPUof I/O-processing tasks and puts several common interface functions on onechip, reducing the board space required.andP;  This chip probably contributedsubstantially to the compact size of the RS2030.andM;WELL-CONNECTEDandM;Mips uses the Am7990 Lance Ethernet controller to provide both standard andthing-wire Ethernet connections.andP;  The keyboard controller handles a standardIBM PC AT-style keyboard.andP;  In fact, the RS2030's Technical Reference refersthe reader to the IBM PC Hardware Reference Library for more informationabout the keyboard controller.andM;The separate video board has only frame bufer memory, color RAM,digital-to-analog converters and associated display-supporting hardware.andO;this means that the RS2030's CPU is responsible for all graphics operations,unlike some other workstations that have separate graphics processors.andP;  Bothcolor and monochrome systems use the same video board.andM;For color systems, the board contains enough memory to provide 1,280 pixelsby 1,024 scan lines.andP;  Each displayed pixel is represented by a byte in theframe buffer, so each pixel can be one of 256 colors.andP;  Because each pixelbyte is then mapped to eight bits per color (eight red, eight green, eightblue), there are more than 16.7 million possible colors, but only 256different colors can be displayed at once.andM;For a monochrome display, the video board is used to generate four-bitgray-scale values, which are transmitted over the green connector of the RGBcable.andP;  The red and blue connectors are unused.andM;The video RAM is designed to optimize writes from the CPU to the framebuffer.andP;  If successive writes from the CPU are to the same page of video RAM(adjacent lines of video), then they can often be accomplished in only threeclock cycles per write.andM;The CPU and video boards are in the system cabinet.andP;  Two half-height,3-1/2-inch drives can be installed in the cabinet; our review unit had one172MB hard disk drive.andP;  A 1.44MB 3-1/2-inch floppy drive is also available.andM;Storage expansion is easily accomplished through the SCSI connection.andP;  Mipshas an expansion cabinet with the same dimensions and appearance as the MipsM/120-5 compute server and the power supply necessary for five full-height,5-1/4-inch disk drives or four disks and a quarter-inch cartridge tape drive.andM;Alternatively, a shoebox cabinet can be used to hold a QIC-150 quarter-inchcartridge tape drive.andP;  (Such a cartridge tape drive, priced at $2,000, wasincluded with our review unit.)andM;All I/O connections are made from the rear of the system cabinet; there areports for standard and thin-wire Ethernet, SCSI connections and the keyboard,as well as a parallel communications port a video port and two serial ports.andO;The first serial port is used for the RS2030's mouse.andM;The RS2030's color monitor is a 19-inch Trinitron unit with a display thathas exceptional clarity.andP;  It was a real relief to work with the monitor afterhaving used a VAXstation II/GPX.andP;  The mouse is a Logitech three-buttonmechanical model, and the keyboard is an IBM PC XT- and AT-compatible typefrom Keytronic.andM;We found the keyboard to be less than ideal.andP;  A major problem is theplacement of the Control keys, which are located on the extreme left- andright-hand sides of the bottom row.andM;The keyboard delivered with our review unit also had an extremely sensitivecontrol key, which would consider itself pressed if we so much as looked atit.andP;  What's worse, it would remain &quot;pressed&quot; even when we stopped pressingit.andP;  Because the key was in such an exposed location, we frequently foundourselves generating andless;Controlandgt; C and andless;Controlandgt; D characters unintentionally.andO;This had the unfortunate results of stopping programs and logging us out.andM;The placement of the Contrl keys can be modified in monitor mode (that is,before RISC/os is booted) or from within Mips' RISCwindows windowing system(by using a short xmodmap file included under the examples in the on-linedocumentation for xmodmap), but the placement of the keys was still quiteaggravating.andP;  What's worse, the Emacs editor on the RISC/os version 4.1distribution tape is ill-behaved and often reset that mapping back to thedefault on our unit.andM;The RS2030 was easier to install than many IBM PC clones.andP;  With the exceptionof the monitor itself, which requires two persons to move, all of itscomponents are quite small.andP;  The mouse and keyboard plug into the back of thesystem unit, and the RGB cable connects the system unit to the monitor.andP;  TheQIC-150 tape drive in its shoebox cabinet had its own power cord and a SCSIcable to connect it to the system unit.andM;The workstation arrived with RISC/os version 4.0 installed on disk, so therewas no tedium of loading the operating system from tape before we could bootthe machine and be up and running.andP;  However, we also received the latestversion of the operating system, 4.1, which we installed, as well asRISCwindows version 3.0.andM;RISC/os version 4.1 and RISCwindows were easy to install: Installing RISC/osinvolved booting from the tape and following the simple instructions of thescript and the manual; for RISCwindows we then brought the system down tosingle-user mode with the telinit command and executed the script/usr/pkg/bin/inst to perform the installation.andM;We elected not to install the Emacs editor (which was on the RISC/os version4.1 tape) when we first installed 4.1 because the installation guide warnedthat we might not have enough disk space left, which would probably have beenthe case if we had been doing any substantial work on the machine.andM;Prospective users of the RS2030 would be wise to evaluate storagerequirements carefully.andM;RISC/os includes a combined System V and BSD Unix environment, and usersneeding only one or the other could probably elect to leave some packagesuninstalled.andM;We had no problems installing RISC/os, RISCwindows or Mips Fortran.andP;  However,the Emacs editor package (which, because it came on the 4.1 tape, we assumedMips had tested) wreaked some havoc.andM;About 46 files in the /etc directory that are actually links to other fileshad their links removed, and this prevented the machine from starting up suchsystem services as the network services and RISCwindows.andP;  We fixed thesituation quite easily, however, by checking the /usr/pkg/lib/umips-4.10/boms(bill of materials) file that is used during installation and construction asimple csh scrip to re-create those links.andP;  We had no problems after that.andM;Basic system management is quite easy under RISC/os.andP;  For ourneeds--installing software, adding and deleting users, etc.--we only neededto use the sysadm utility, which is a simple, menu-based tool for performingsuch functions.andM;ZIPPING ALONGandM;Of course, the first thing we did once the machine was up was to copy over DRLabs' CPU 2 suite of Fortran benchmarks and run them.andM;Our benchmarks are well-behaved under Unix, and compiling and executing themunder RISC/os was a breeze.andP;  The rS2030's performance was in the sameballpark as that of the DECstation 3100 (as might be expected, because themachines use the same CPU chip) but was somewhat higher.andP;  the rS2030completed the 34 kernels of the suite with a geometric mean time of 5.43seconds, yielding an MVUP rating of 14.90.andP;  The DECstation 3100 clocked in at12.81 MVUPs.andM;This was using the default optimization level, signified by the -0 switch onthe f77 command line.andP;  The compiler has four documented optimization levels:none, quick optimizations, global optimizations and global registerallocation.andM;With RISCwindows installed, when the system completes the boot process, thewindow manager immediately starts up.andP;  The user is presented with aRISCwindows login screen (similar to the one DECwindows displays) that allowsa user-name and password to be entered.andP;  After the user logs in, the windowmanager--uwm, by default--starts xclock in the lower right-hand corner andstarts an xterm session for the user to work in.andM;A minor annoyance is that, though most of the fonts available areproportionally spaced fonts, xterm assumes the use of a monofont.andP;  Thisyields some weird spacing of text on the display.andM;X windows neophytes may not be able to do much more with RISCwindows thanwork in a terminal window or launch some of the simple applications the comewith RISCwindows, such as xclock, puzzle and maze.andM;To further complicate matters, we did not receive any printed RISCwindowsdocumentation and had to rely on the on-line man pages (which were, like mostUnix man pages, pretty horrendous).andM;RISCwindows includes three X windows managers: uwm, twm and awm.andP;  The uwm andawm managers are &quot;menu-drive.&quot;andP;  To modify the screen (moving or resizingwindows, for example), a user holds the second mouse button down when thepointer is on the background, which brings up a pop-up menu.andP;  The user thandrags to the item desired, releases the button and manipulates the window tobe changed.andM;The twm window manager, however, does not use such a pop-up menu but insteadis very much like the DECwindows window manager.andP;  Each of the windows has atitle bar at the top, with an Iconify buttom in the upper left corner andPush-Behind and Resize buttons in the top right.andM;By default, none of the window managers make windows with scroll bars (asDECwindows does), but this behavior can be modified by starting the xtermapplication with the -sb option.andM;The Emacs editor shipped on the RISC/os version 4.1 tape wasX-windows-compatible, so it has its own window and the mouse could be usedwith it.andM;At present, Mips lists about 154 applications available for the RS2030, insuch areas as general business and office operations, database management,design and manufacturing, mathematical and scientific analysis, networkingand communications, and software design and development.andM;READ ALL ABOUT ITandM;The RS2030 was accompanied by a healthy amount of documentation: 15 separatemanuals.andP;  There are the ubiquitous reference pages that accompany almostevery version of Unix: the User's Reference Manual, the Programmer'sReference Manual and the System Administrator's Reference Manual.andM;Mips has also further developed its guides and now offers the USER's Guide,programmer's Guide (two volumes), System Administrator's Guide (Two volumes),Languages Programmer's Guide, Streams Primer and Programming Guide, andAssembly Language Programmer's Guide.andM;The innovative feature of the RS2030 is the amount of power that is availablein such a small footprint.andP;  The machine take up a minimal amount of space,yet provides almost 15 times the CPU processing power of a MicroVAX II.andP;  Mipshas devliered yet another big contender in a small box.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
