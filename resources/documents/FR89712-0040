These tobacco plants will be used as a model system to investigatethe possibility of lowering the concentrations of toxic metals in leaftissue. The assessment provides a basis for the conclusion that the fieldtesting of these genetically engineered tobacco plants will not presenta risk of introduction or dissemination of a plant pest and will not haveany significant impact on the quality of the human environment.

A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906).The University of Kentucky at Lexington, Kentucky, has submitted an applicationfor a permit for release into the environment, to field test geneticallyengineered tobacco plants modified to express a mouse metallothionein gene.These tobacco plants will be used as a model system to investigate thepossibility of lowering the concentrations of toxic metals in leaf tissue.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the tobacco plants under the conditionsdescribed in the University of Kentucky application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will not have any significant impact on the quality ofthe human environment. The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by the University of Kentucky, as well as areview of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentationof APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing. The facts supporting APHIS's finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment. 1. A metallothionein (MT) gene from the mouse has been modified and insertedinto a tobacco chromosome. In this field trial none of the introduced genescan spread to another plant, because the test plants will not be allowedto flower. In nature, genetic material contained in a chromosome can onlybe transferred to another sexually compatible plant by cross-pollinationand fertilization. 2. Neither the MT gene itself, nor its gene product, confers on tobaccoany plant pest characteristics. 3. The MT gene does not provide the transformed tobacco plants with anymeasurable selective advantage over nontransformed tobacco plants in theirability to be disseminated or to become established in the environment.4. The vector used to transfer the MT gene to tobacco plants has been evaluatedfor its use in this specific experiment, and does not pose a plant pestrisk. The vector, although derived from a DNA sequence with known plantpathogenic potential, has been disarmed; that is, the genes that are necessaryfor pathogenicity have been removed. The vector also has been tested andshown to be not pathogenic to a susceptible plant. 5. The vector agent, the phytopathogenic bacterium that was used to deliverthe vector DNA carrying the MT gene into tobacco plant cells, was eliminatedand is no longer associated with the transformed tobacco plants. 6. Horizontal movement of genetic material after insertion into the plantgenome (i.e., into chromosomal DNA) has not been demonstrated. After deliveringand inserting the DNA to be transferred into the tobacco genome, the vectordoes not survive in or on the transformed plant. No mechanism is knownto exist in nature to move an inserted gene horizontally from a chromosomeof a transformed plant to any other organism. 7. The field test plot will be less than 0.1 acre in size, and the testplants will be located approximately 50 meters from any other tobacco plants.Measurement of heavy metal uptake by these transgenic plants will not involveadministration of any exogenous heavy metals on the test plot. This environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations for Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHISGuidelines for Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 6th day of July 1989  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
