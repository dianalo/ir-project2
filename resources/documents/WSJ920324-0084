But Americanshave been so bombarded with rhetoric about Japan's allegedsuperiority that they find it hard to believe Japan's economyis clearly sinking, just as the U.S. economy is showing signsof life.   Japan's economy grew more slowly than the U.S. economy inthe third quarter of last year, and actually contracted inthe fourth. Even before that happened, Japan had become farless competitive on world export markets. The volume of U.S.exports increased by 13% a year from 1986 to 1990, comparedwith only 2.8% for Japan. In 1991, Japan's merchandiseexports rose 2.2% as measured in yen, but that was noincrease at all in real terms. Real U.S. exports, bycontrast, increased another 7% last year, despite a declinein world imports.</LP><TEXT>   The most serious trade threat from Japan is that country'seconomic weakness, not its strength. Because the Japaneseeconomy is so feeble, Japan now imports less from many ofAmerica's best export customers -- Canada, South Korea,Australia, Europe and the Middle East. Measured in dollars(which is what matters to U.S. trade), Japan's imports fellby 25% from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the third quarterof 1991, while non-oil imports fell by 9%. That contractionin Japan's imports had nothing to do with Japan's tradebarriers, and everything to do with Japan's slump. And thecontraction of Japan's purchases hurt many other economies,which in turn hurts U.S. exports.   With Japan's stock market down by half, and profits andreal estate prices down too, Japanese investors have goodreason to be exporting capital to more promising economies,just as foreign investors have been abandoning the Japanesestock market for years. The return on added capital has longbeen much lower in Japan than in the U.S., the productivityof capital is negative, and Japan's firms can no longer counton cheap capital now that stock market values are cut inhalf.   So long as Japan is plagued by a capital outflow, it mustrun a current account (trade and other foreign income)surplus. No amount of &quot;export restraint&quot; can change thatreality, any more than one and one can add up to three. IfJapan's surplus cannot be achieved through exports, then itmust be achieved by reduced imports. Since U.S. exports, tocountries trying to sell to Japan, have been this economy'sgreatest strength in recent years, it is not in ourself-interest to force Japan to slash imports even further,or to divert dwindling imports from other countries to theU.S.   Japan is not doing so well on the export side either. Oncethe number one source of imported televisions in the U.S.,Japan is now number six, and the same trend is evident in thesaturated VCR market. Japan has had little success sellingcomputers in the U.S., and the few exceptions (such asportables) depend on U.S. hard disks, chip boards andmicroprocessors. In such important high-tech industries aschemicals, drugs and aircraft, Japan is not even a seriousplayer.   What about autos? Japan clearly produces excellent cars,but much of this production has been shifted to North Americaand Britain, where land and labor are not so scarce. Japanrecently bowed to congressional threats and agreed to reduceits &quot;voluntary&quot; export restraints on cars and trucks bynearly 40%, to 1.65 million, from a previous limit of 2.3million. However, Japan has long been unable to export nearlyas many cars as the old limit allowed -- only 1.76 millioncars last year.   Contrary to popular illusions, U.S. car and truck importshave been falling for four years, while U.S. exports ofvehicles and parts have been rising quite impressively. FewAmericans realize how many &quot;Japanese&quot; cars and parts are, infact, produced in the U.S. and Canada. And few Americansrealize the extent to which domestic and imported Japanesemodels have replaced cars previously imported from Europe.Volkswagen, which used to have 10% of the U.S. market, cannothold on to 1%. Yet U.S. imports of Japanese vehicles havealso fallen every year since 1986.   U.S. sales of imported cars and light trucks fell frommore than 3.8 million in the peak 1988 model year to only 2.6million in 1991 -- a drop of nearly 31%. Sales of domesticvehicles in the same period fell by a relatively modest 14%.Adding auto parts does not change this picture. Japan hasinvested heavily in nearly 250 U.S. parts companies, half ofwhich are joint ventures, and many of these firms supplyDetroit's Big Three. Two popular models, the Honda Accord andMazda 626, already have a higher domestic content than theFord Crown Victoria, and other Japanese &quot;transplants&quot; arerushing to catch up, to maintain &quot;just in time&quot; inventorycontrol. Imports of Japanese auto parts in the first half of1991 were down 20%.   Measured in constant 1987 dollars, U.S. imports of bothvehicles and parts in the first three quarters of 1991 hadfallen by $10.9 billion since 1987, while U.S. exports ofvehicles and parts were up $18.3 billion. Measured by value,Japan is the number two market for U.S. exports of passengercars, spending $711 million in 1990.   The U.S. has already had enough experience with voluntaryexport restraints to make it difficult to see why evenMichigan legislators could possibly imagine that such quotasdo anything but subsidize Japanese auto companies at theexpense of U.S. consumers. Because the first round of quotaswere dispensed to Japanese companies that had alreadygarnered a big share of the U.S. market (Toyota and Nissan),smaller Japanese firms had no choice but to build plants inthe U.S. and Canada if they hoped to sell cars here.   The initial effect of the voluntary export restraints wasthus to raise prices and profits for Toyota and Nissan andtheir U.S. dealers, but those protected profits provided aneven greater incentive to build capacity inside the U.S.trade walls. We thus ended up with Honda in Ohio,Subaru-Isuzu in Indiana, Mitsubishi in Illinois, Mazda inMichigan, Nissan in Tennessee and Toyota in Kentucky andCalifornia. Four of these plants are joint ventures with BigThree companies, each of which owns a minority share of oneor more Japanese auto companies. Three of the transplantfactories are unionized. These transplants collectively havethe capacity to build 1.8 million vehicles.   The transplants have great potential to export to Europe,Asia, the Middle East, and the newly opening markets ofMexico (which imported nearly 13,000 U.S. cars in 1990),Argentina and Brazil. These exports will add to U.S. jobs andincomes, but they threaten Big Three foreign plants, whichhave been producing inside the cozy protectionist walls ofEurope, Mexico, Australia and elsewhere.   As the Commerce Department's Industrial Outlook observes,&quot;the Big Three's well established, wholly-owned foreignsubsidiaries and their numerous joint ventures diminish thepossibility that Big Three unit exports from the UnitedStates will become significant.&quot; The future of the U.S. autoindustry must lie in exports, because the U.S. is an agingsociety with very few new buyers. But the Japanesetransplants appear more likely to aggressively pursue exportmarkets than the Big Three.   The first round of export restraints on Japanese autossimply encouraged that country to export expensive models andto produce cheaper models inside America's tariff wall. OtherU.S. import quotas on steel, machine tools, upholsterymaterial and semiconductors all added to the cost of makingcars in the U.S., thus damaging the auto industry's profitsand competitiveness. By tightening the auto VERs evenfurther, Japanese firms will now have an even strongerincentive to export expensive luxury and sports cars, and toexpand their production in the U.S. This is good news forOhio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee and California,but very bad news for automakers in Michigan (except Mazda),whose lobbying efforts have once again been quite suicidal.   The Japanese government could be doing more to help theanemic economy. Japan's government plans to extend a&quot;temporary&quot; 6% sales tax on cars and 2.5% surtax on corporateprofits, and also add new taxes on inheritances, money-losingcorporations and land holding. The extra 6% tax penalty onautos makes it unnecessarily difficult for both foreign anddomestic car companies to sell in that market.   The U.S. has a strong interest in seeing the Japaneseeconomy get back on its feet, and bad trade relations are notgoing to help. So long as the Japanese economy and stockmarket remain so depressed, threatening the Japanesegovernment is a waste of time. It is people rather thangovernments who buy most foreign goods, and weak economieswith falling asset values neither need nor can afford manyimports.   ---   Mr. Reynolds is director of economic studies at the HudsonInstitute in Indianapolis, Ind.</TEXT></DOC>
