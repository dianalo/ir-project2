Identix makes devices that verify an individual's identity by &quot;reading&quot; his fingerprint and comparing it to the print in the device's computer memory. Currently, the devices are used to control access to security areas or computer files and for electronic funds transfer.    The company said it will begin shipping 30 scanners a month to its distributor in Japan, which will adapt the systems for use by Sanwa Home Co. The initial order calls for a total of 360 of the systems, which retail for $3,500 each. </TEXT></DOC>
