It is the determination of FmHA that the proposedaction does not constitute a major Federal Action significantly affectingthe quality of the human environment, and in accordance with the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-190, an Environmental ImpactStatement is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of the Proposed Rule </ITAG>The agency is proposing to amend its guaranteed loan regulations to permitthe payment of estimated loss claims, while a borrower is engaged in areorganization bankruptcy at the time a plan is confirmed by the bankruptcycourt, and at the completion of the bankruptcy plan, with regular annualpayments to compensate the lender for any court ordered permanent reductionin the interest rate. This amendment is needed to remove an administrativebarrier to allow greater participation in the guaranteed loan program andto create a more cost effective program for the Government. Under existingregulations, the only alternative in bankruptcy reorganization cases isto wait until the loan is paid in full which may be up to forty years,during which time the lender will continue to accrue interest on the principalportion of the loan which was written off by the bankruptcy court. Theagency would then be obligated to pay on the loss sustained, includinga loss of accured interest that would normally be at a rate in excess ofthe Government's cost of money. In a bankruptcy the amount or terms of the debt may be changed by a confirmedreorganization plan resulting in an immediate and ascertainable loss tothe creditor. It is more equitable that FmHA as the guarantor fulfill itsobligation to the lender at the time the plan is confirmed rather thanwaiting until the plan is completed. On November 26, 1986, the United StatesCongress enacted the new Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code. Under thislegislation, farmers, are given the opportunity to reorganize their financesbased on the value of the property held and pay off their delinquent debtsover a three to five year period with the balance written off, rather thanfacing potential liquidation. Chapter 12 does not allow the creditor toveto the farmers' reorganization plan, have the bankruptcy proceedingsdismissed, or have the proceedings converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation,except in cases where the borrower commits fraud in the bankruptcy plan.Although participation in the guaranteed loan program administered by FmHAis increasing, many lenders are becoming reluctant to make agriculturalloans and business and industry loans even with the benefit of a Governmentguarantee. Lenders that have a concentration of loan protfolio in agricultureare obviously more vulnerable when farm conditions deteriorate. Also, inorder to generate increased revenue to cover loan losses lenders must increaseinterest rate and deny credit to certain types of applicants. Farmers andrural businesses are then faced with few alternative sources of credit,especially those in the most precarious financial situations who must obtainoperating credit and credit necessary in connection with debt restructuring.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1980 </ITAG>Agriculture, Loan programs_agriculture.Therefore, Chapter XVII, Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations is amendedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1980_GENERAL</ITAG>1.

These responsibilities include,but are not limited to:(1) The lender will file a proof of claim where necessary and all the necessarypapers and pleadings concerning the case.(2) The lender will attend and where necessary participate in meetingsof the creditors and all court proceedings.(3) The lender, whose collateral is subject to being used by the bankruptcyestate, will immediately seek adequate protection of the collateral. Adequateprotection of the collateral, depending on interpretation, may take severalforms. In a bankruptcy, the trustee is authorized to sell, lease or usethe collateral if the borrower's business is in operation. The only collateralthe trustee cannot utilize is cash collateral unless the secured creditorgrants permission or the bankruptcy court authorizes the use of such aftergiving a proper hearing and notice.(i) Cash collateral means cash, negotiable instruments, documents of title,securities, deposit accounts, or other cash equivalents, such as accountsreceivable.(ii) Concerning machinery, equipment and real estate, adequate protectioncan be interpreted differently under reorganization. The bankruptcy trusteecould dispose of certain collateral and grant to the secured party a replacementlien on some other collateral which may or may not have the same value.For example, the lender may hold a first lien on a good saleable pieceof real estate and could find replacement of this particular parcel ofproperty with a second or possibly a third lien on another parcel of landthat the lender may find undesirable for adequate protection. There areno guarantees to the lender when the borrower is in reorganization thatthe collateral will be protected to the lender's satisfaction. The lendershould be fully aware of what is taking place with the collateral and resistany adverse changes that may be made in the collateral securing the FmHAguaranteed loan.(4) When permitted by the Bankruptcy Code, the lender will request a modificationof any plan of reorganization whenever it appears that additional recoveriesare likely.(5) FmHA will be kept adequately and regularly informed in writing on allaspects of the proceedings.(b) <T3>Reorganization bankruptcy cases. </T3>(1) In Chapter 11, 12, or 13reorganization, if an independent appraisal of collateral is necessaryin FmHA's opinion, FmHA and the lender will share the appraisal fee equally.(2) Lender expenses, in a Chapter 11, 12, or 13 reorganization case, arenot deducted from the proceeds of the collateral because a reorganizationis not a liquidation. All expenses incurred by the lender (including attorney'sfees), while the borrower is in reorganization, are considered normal expensesof servicing the account, and therefore are the responsibility of the lenderand are not deductible from the proceeds of the collateral or covered underthe FmHA guarantee.(c) <T3>Liquidation bankruptcy cases. </T3>(1) Attorney fees incurred by thelender, without exception, cannot be approved. Reasonable and customaryliquidation expenses may be deducted from the proceeds of the collateralin liquidation bankruptcy cases provided the lender is doing the actualliquidation of the collateral and presents adequate written justificationfor each expense and secures FmHA's written concurrence prior to incurringthe expense.(2) If a trustee is appointed by the bankruptcy court to sell the collateralunder a conversion of a reorganization plan to a liquidation plan or Chapter7, the trustee rather than the lender, in this instance, is responsiblefor liquidating the collateral. Normally, any expenses incurred by thelender during this period are not considered liquidation expenses and cannotbe deducted from collateral proceeds. The lender is not engaged in theactual liquidation but is performing in a manner considered to be normalservicing of the loan under the circumstances.(3) If the property is abandoned by the trustee and the lender is actuallyengaged in actual liquidation, reasonable liquidation expenses would berecoverable from liquidation proceeds with prior written concurrence foreach expense from FmHA before the expense is incurred.(d) <T3>Loss payments. </T3>See paragraph XVI of Form FmHA 449-35 or Form FmHA1980-38.<ITAG tagnum="73">Administrative</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) The lender is responsible for advising FmHA of the completionof the reorganization plan; however, the FmHA servicing office will monitorthe lender's files to ensure timely notification of servicing actions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) If an estimated loss claim is paid during the operation of thereorganization plan, and the borrower repays the loan in full without anadditional loss sustained by the lender, a Final Report of loss is notnecessary.

Consequently expenses incurred by the lenderin a Chapter 11 reorganization can never be liquidation expenses unlessthe proceeding becomes a Liquidating 11. If the proceeding should becomea Liquidating 11, reasonable and customary liquidation expenses from thatpoint forward may be shared as provided by the Lender's Agreement. Chapter7 pertains to a liquidation of the borrower's assets.

Adequateprotection of the collateral, depending on interpretation, may take severalforms. In a bankruptcy, the trustee is authorized to sell, lease or usethe collateral if the borrower's business is in operation. The only collateralthe trustee cannot utilize is cash collateral unless the secured creditorgrants permission or the bankruptcy court authorizes the use of such aftergiving a proper hearing and notice.(i) Cash collateral means cash, negotiable instruments, documents of title,securities, deposit accounts, or other cash equivalents, such as accountsreceivable.(ii) Concerning machinery, equipment and real estate, adequate protectioncan be interpreted differently under reorganization. The bankruptcy trusteecould dispose of certain collateral and grant to the secured party a replacementlien on some other collateral which may or may not have the same value.For example, the lender may hold a first lien on a good saleable pieceof real estate and could find replacement of this particular parcel ofproperty with a second or possibly a third lien on another parcel of landthat the lender may find undesirable for adequate protection. There areno guarantees to the lender when the borrower is in reorganization thatthe collateral will be protected to the lender's satisfaction. The lendershould be fully aware of what is taking place with the collateral and resistany adverse changes that may be made in the collateral securing the FmHAguaranteed loan.(4) When permitted by the Bankruptcy Code, the lender will request a modificationof any plan of reorganization whenever it appears that additional recoveriesare likely.(5) FmHA will be kept adequately and regularly informed in writing of allaspects of the proceedings.(b) <T3>Reorganization bankruptcy cases. </T3>(1) In a Chapter 11, 12, or 13reorganization, if an independent appraisal of collateral is necessaryin FmHA's opinion, FmHA and the lender will share the appraisal fee equally.(2) Lender expenses in a Chapter 11, 12, or 13 reorganization case arenot deducted from the proceeds of the collateral because a reorganizationis not a liquidation. All expenses incurred by the lender (including attorney'sfees), while the borrower is in reorganization, are considered normal expensesof servicing the account, and therefore are the responsibility of the lenderand are not deductible from the proceeds of the collateral or covered underthe FmHA guarantee.(c) <T3>Liquidation bankruptcy cases. </T3>(1) Attorney fees incurred by thelender, without exception, cannot be approved. Reasonable and customaryliquidation expenses may be deducted from the proceeds of the collateralin liquidation bankruptcy cases, provided the lender is doing the actualliquidation of the collateral and presents adequate written justificationfor each expense and secured FmHA's written concurrence prior to incurringthe expense.(2) If a trustee is appointed by the bankruptcy court to sell the collateralunder a conversion of a reorganization plan to a liquidation plan or Chapter7, the trustee rather than the lender in this instance is responsible forliquidating the collateral. Normally, any expenses incurred by the lenderduring this period are not considered liquidation expenses and cannot bededucted from collateral proceeds. The lender is not engaged in the actualliquidation but is performing in a manner considered to be normal servicingof the loan under the circumstances.(3) If the property is abandoned by the trustee and the lender is actuallyengaged in actual liquidation, reasonable liquidation expenses would berecoverable from liquidation proceeds with prior written concurrence foreach expense from FmHA before the expense is incurred.(d) <T3>Loss Payments</T3>.

A copyof the promissory note and ledger should also be attached.
