Laboratory measurementswere taken while the probe was scanned along the web of a section ofrail under compressive stress in a loading machine and exposed to a magneticfield. Approaches for reducing the effect of variations in material propertiesby using stress induced anisotropy and spatial averaging of the datawere also investigated and were shown to be promising. A schematic diagramof the acquisition system is given and nonlinear harmonic signal amplitudesare graphed.</TEXT></DOC>
