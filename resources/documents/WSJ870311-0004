The Senate select committee investigating the scandal is expected to vote on the matter today. But the decision to initiate immunity proceedings for Mr. Hakim, a close associate of retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, appears to have support already among the leadership in both panels.    An immediate decision isn't expected on granting the same protection to Gen. Secord or the two principal witnesses in the affair, former National Security Council adviser John Poindexter and his fired aide, Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North.    Lawrence Walsh, the independent counsel appointed to investigate the affair, yesterday asked the House panel to wait at least 90 days before considering granting immunity to Messrs. Secord, Poindexter and North. He has warned that too quick a grant of immunity could stymie his criminal probe.    Leaders of the Senate panel said they expected that none of the three would be granted immunity to testify to Congress before late May.    While that still might be several weeks earlier than Mr. Walsh proposed, the differences between the lawmakers and the prosecutor appear narrow enough for them to reach some compromise. Mr. Walsh described his request for a 90-day delay as a &quot;fair balance&quot; between his needs as a prosecutor and Congress's interest in a public airing of facts behind the affair.    Republicans and Democrats on the House panel indicated that they would support Mr. Walsh, and the bipartisan leadership in the Senate was careful to play down whatever tensions there have been between their panel and the special prosecutor.    Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii), the committee chairman, said it is &quot;safe to say&quot; that none of the three chief witnesses would appear before late May under any grant of immunity, and the panel's chief counsel, Arthur Liman, said pointedly that the panel had always sought to accommodate Mr. Walsh.    It was unclear last night whether Mr. Walsh would support granting immunity to Mr. Hakim, who would be the most important figure yet to be granted immunity in return for agreeing to testify on the Iran-Contra affair before Congress.    Through his close association with Gen. Secord, Mr. Hakim is believed to have intimate knowledge of the financial transactions involved in the complex corporate network used to carry out the U.S. weapon sales to Tehran and the funneling of arms to the Nicaraguan insurgents.    Now a U.S. citizen, Mr. Hakim never appeared before the Tower Commission or the House and Senate Intelligence committees. He is believed currently to be out of the country, and a decision to grant him immunity appears to be part of an effort to convince him to come forward.    Mr. Walsh and the congressional panels are seeking Swiss bank records related to the Iran and Contra transactions.    Mr. Hakim has long been involved in international finance. Much of the network used in the transactions was organized from a Geneva financial-services firm, Cie. des Services Fiduciares; the firm's principals include Willard Zucker, an American-born attorney and longstanding counsel to Mr. Hakim.    In a related development yesterday, a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee heard testimony from Faith Whittlesey, a former White House aide who had worked with Col. North on the Nicaragua issue before her appointment as the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland in the spring of 1985.    Ms. Whittlesey denied any personal knowledge of Col. North's activities in the Iran-Contra affair or of trips he took to Switzerland. She said that as ambassador she had spoken with Col. North only twice -- in September and October last year. Both of those talks dealt with a separate controversy surrounding her handling of the embassy and a &quot;guest fund&quot; financed largely by tax-exempt contributions from Americans, she said. </TEXT></DOC>
