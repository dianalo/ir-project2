SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The State Department, acting under courtdecisions banning sex discrimination, is revamping its entranceexam and informing about 600 female Foreign Service officers theymay be entitled to new jobs, it was disclosed on Thursday.   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, discussing theagency's response to a suit that dates back 13 years, saidSecretary of State James A. Baker III ``is firmly committed toensuring that there be no discrimination in the Department of Stateof any kind. If past policies have contradicted this position, theymust and will be changed.''   Boucher told reporters that the department sent cables to U.S.embassies around the world and planned to inform employees of aU.S. District Court ruling that the department has discriminatedagainst women in the Foreign Service dating back to 1976.   The spokesman said the notification was sent to comply with acourt order issued Jan. 31 and outlines remedies to be provided.   They include, he said, ``ensuring that there is nodiscrimination against women in the future regarding assignments,performance evaluation, occupational specialties, and superiorhonor awards.''   He added that the department is revamping its entrance exam forForeign Service officers because of a separate court order``finding that the written exam has adversely affected women. We'vedecided that that must change, and it will change.''   The actions stem from a suit filed in 1976 by Alison Palmer, anow-retired Foreign Service officer who claimed the departmentdiscriminated against women in hiring and promotion, said Ms.Palmer's attorney, Monica Wagner.   The suit alleged the department discriminated against women byhiring more men, giving men the better career assignments and morecareer-advancing performance ratings and honor awards.   Under the order, a woman is eligible for relief if she can showthat she sought or ``would have sought, absent discrimination'' anyof the department's better assignments.   If cases of discrimination are found, the court order requiresthe department to allow women to transfer to other job areas, beoffered other assignments and raise their performance ratings.   Ms. Wagner said her client will not be a direct beneficiary ofthe court order because she has retired. Only those women who arepart of the class-action suit and are still working for the ForeignService are affected.   ``The benefit for her is in seeing the State Department takeaction with respect to the sex discrimination found by the court,''Ms. Wagner said.   Ms. Wagner said some 600 women may be entitled to thecourt-ordered relief.   Boucher was asked by a reporter whether Baker planned to``demonstrate his commitment to women's rights'' by naming morewomen to high-level State Department posts.   So far, Baker has named one woman as an assistant secretary ofstate _ his longtime aide, Margaret Tutwiler, who is the assistantsecretary of state for public affairs.   ``You mean, like my boss?'' Bocher responded, drawing laughterfrom the journalists.   Boucher noted that Baker had issued a statement on equalopportunities shortly after taking office, and that not allpositions had been filled.   ``In any case, he's very firmly committed to this. ... It's amatter of great importance to him, and I'm sure he will carry itout fully,'' said Boucher.   The State Department had won the Palmer lawsuit in a lower courtbut was reversed three months ago by the U.S. Court of Appeals forthe District of Columbia.   Boucher said the State Department has filed a notice of intentto appeal the case, but added this was done ``in order to preservethat option if it's appropriate after a full review by thedepartment and the Department of Justice.''</TEXT></DOC>
