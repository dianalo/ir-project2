U.S. District Judge Edward Davis said this morning he would heararguments Thursday on whether the pilots' strike was only a refusalto cross Machinists' picket lines, or was a primary strike, whichcould be illegal under the Railway Labor Act.   The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta had asked the judgefor a decision on the issue, which is central to Eastern's legalefforts to end the 3-week-old walkout.   ``As I see it, I need to make a determination whether refusal tocross the picket line is a `pretext,''' the judge said today. ``Imust determine what the appeals court means about `pretext.'''   Air Line Pilots Association attorney James Linsey asked forThursday's hearing during the judge's meeting with lawyers.   ``We don't think that Eastern has shown in the previous hearingsthat ALPA's action was a pretext,'' Linsey said.   ALPA claims the Railway Labor Act gives its members the right toshow sympathy for the striking Machinists. The appeals courtagreed, but added that ``a claim of a sympathy strike cannot beused as a pretext to shield conduct that otherwise would be a clearviolation of the Railway Labor Act.''   Eastern lawyer David Ross said today that the judge already hadenough evidence, unsuccessfully arguing for Davis to immediatelyforward to the appeals judges the finding that the pilots' walkoutwas not allowed.   Meanwhile, Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said the first six-weektraining class for about 40 replacement pilots was beginning todaywith an organizational session. All but 200 of Eastern's 3,600pilots have refused to work since the strike began March 4.   ``I have heard that they're even coming from other airlines,''Ashlock said of the new pilots. ``They're coming over because theycan make seniority faster.''   Eastern has been operating only about 10 percent of its dailypre-strike schedule of 1,040 flights, concentrating on routes fromthe airline's Miami hub to the Northeast and from Florida to theCaribbean, which were the most heavily traveled on Eastern's past,said spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.   The pilots union continued to play down Eastern's efforts tohire replacement pilots, saying there simply aren't enough pilotsto fill available airline slots, especially at Eastern andContinental Airlines, which are operated by Frank Lorenzo'sHouston-based Texas Air Corp.   ``Young pilots know better than to go to work for FrankLorenzo,'' said Capt. Jack Saux, a Delta Airlines pilot andchairman of ALPA's education committee. Saux said in a news releasethat he and other ALPA members have been meeting with pilots fromregional airlines and corporations as well as student pilots.</TEXT></DOC>
