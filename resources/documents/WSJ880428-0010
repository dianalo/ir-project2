President Barber Conable said the agreement on expanding the bank's capital resources became effective yesterday, following ratification of an accord by 133 countries accounting for about 77% of the agency's voting power.    The U.S. is the only major industrial nation that hasn't yet formally ratified its participation, World Bank sources said.    But the White House has asked Congress to approve the increase and Treasury Secretary James Baker is slated to appear before a House appropriations subcommittee today to request such action.    Mr. Conable said the increase clears the way for the bank to increase its lending to developing nations by about 10% annually. </TEXT></DOC>
