The Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development report, based on data compiled by the United Nations, said this mark was reached at 47 minutes after midnight Greenwhich Mean Time yesterday.    Asia, the world's most populous region, accounts for 60% of the total global population, which passed the five billion mark in July 1987. Seven babies are born in Asia every second -- or 150,000 each day, the report said.    The forum, headed by Takashi Sato, Japan's Agriculture Minister, issued the report at an international conference in Tokyo last month, heralding the Day of the Three Billion. The forum includes 19 Asian nations from Australia to Syria.    &quot;The designation of a day marking the birth of the three-billionth baby in Asia is very symbolic,&quot; Shigemi Kono, director general of the National Institute of Population Problems, said. &quot;But I personally think it is nonsense, because there is no way of actually knowing when the three-billionth baby was born.&quot;    Skepticism about calculations aside, however, Mr. Kono agrees there are serious population problems in the region.    &quot;Though we have come close to solving the fertility rate problem in Japan and China, serious questions remain in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan,&quot; he said.    India, with a population of 818 million, has an annual growth rate of 2.08%. The rate in Pakistan, with a population of 115 million, is 3.45%, and in Bangladesh, with 110 million people, it is 2.67%, according to U.N. estimates.    By the year 2025, Asia will have 4.5 billion inhabitants, said an official with the nonprofit, Tokyo-based Asian Population and Development Association. The estimated growth in Asia is roughly equal to the increase in the total world population from 1950 to 1980, she added.    Specialists have predicted that rice production will have to increase 50% by 2025 to feed the continent. </TEXT></DOC>
