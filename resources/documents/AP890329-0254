BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Texas' energy-wrecked economy doomed MCorp despitethe bank holding company's focus on real estate instead of energyloans, analysts said Wednesday after regulators seized control ofmost of the bank holding company.   ``Once Texas real estate markets began to slip, there really wasvery little they could do,'' said banking analyst Michael Starr atDuff andamp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago. ``What you're seeing in the realestate market is simply what started a decade ago in energyproblems. ... MCorp is at the tail-end of feeling those problems.''   Twenty of MCorp's 25 banks, including the two largest in Dallasand Houston, were declared insolvent late Tuesday and earlyWednesday, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. took overmanagement under a newly chartered, federally owned DepositInsurance Bridge Bank NA while regulators look for a buyer for someor all of the banks.   The FDIC pumped $300 million into the banks, but officials wouldnot say how much government aid ultimately will be required.Analysts have said the price tag could run between $1 billion and$2 billion.   While it was the soft real estate market _ MCorp's own 60-storytower in downtown Dallas is only about 60 percent rented _ thatundercut the bank, a move late last week began the final tumble.   S.N. Phelps andamp; Co., a Connecticutt bond-trading firm, and two ofits employees, sought to force MCorp into bankruptcy because it hadnot made payments on a little more than $2 million in bonds theyheld.   MCorp had suspended payment last October on about $470 millionin bonds and preferred stock.   MCorp on Monday said it would seek protection instead fromcreditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.   The resulting uncertainty apparently set off a run on deposits.   Federal regulators, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidbetween $50 million and $100 million was withdrawn Tuesday fromMBank Dallas, the firm's lead institution. The withdrawals cameboth from individual depositors and some of MCorp's othersubsidiary banks, the regulators said.   The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said Wednesday the FDIC toldthe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency it would no longerprovide open assistance to MCorp.   ``The OCC then advised the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas thatunder these circumstances, they did not consider MCorp a viablefinancial institution,'' according to a statement from the DallasFed. ``Therefore, Tuesday, March 28, 1989, the Dallas Fed calledMCorp's loan.''   The Dallas Fed would not reveal the size of MCorp's loan, butfigures from the central bank's statement of condition indicatethat loans from the Dallas branch have gone from $778 million onJan. 26 to $1.23 billion on March 23.   MCorp is the latest large bank rescue in Texas, although otherinstitutions _ notably Texas American Bancshares Inc. of Fort Worthand National Bancshares Corp. of Texas Inc. in San Antonio _ haveasked for federal assistance and word could come at any time on theresolution of those problems.   Earlier this decade, the Texas economy was booming onprojections of $50-per-barrel oil and that optimism spread todevelopers who rushed to put up project after project, some onflimsy or non-existent demand, according to experts.   A recent survey of real estate owners and developers found 89percent who ``strongly agreed'' or ``somewhat agreed'' that theDallas-Fort Worth market is overbuilt.   In its third-quarter report to stockholders, MCorp said, ``Assetquality problems, largely releated to loans secured by real estateand assets acquired upon foreclosure, adversely affected thecompany's financial performance.''   The bank reported a third-quarter loss of $517 million, and theFDIC says MCorp's 25 banks lost $213 million in the fourth quarterand $903 million for the entire year.   MCorp has yet to release full financial results for the quarterand year.   ``The straightforward, honest answer is that the state of Texaswas hit by an economic H-bomb that had effects on real estateportfolios, energy portfolios, international portfolios anddomestic portfolios,'' said Robert D. Rieke, a banking analyst withthe Dallas firm of Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc.   ``To its tribute, MCorp has been able to withstand the falloutlonger than anybody else,'' said Rieke, once a vice-president andtreasurer at MCorp.   Oil prices dropped rather than rose in the mid-1980s and theimpact hit Houston first and later the Dallas economy.   Duff andamp; Phelps' Starr said MCorp probably was guilty of some``overaggressive lending,'' but not to the extent of some otherTexas banks, and most of its loans were to largely reputabledevelopers.   MCorp Chairman Gene Bishop, who had attempted to put together aprivate recapitalization plan, said Wednesday the five banks left``form the nucleus of a new beginning for MCorp.''   But neither Rieke nor Starr expect that effort to be successful.</TEXT></DOC>
