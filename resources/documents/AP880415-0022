ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A committee of bishops urges the RomanCatholic church to continue its ``conditional acceptance'' ofnuclear weapons, saying they have been a significant factor inpreventing nuclear war.   ``In a dangerous world, a world of both widespread nuclearknowledge and extensive nuclear arsenals, we find condemningnuclear deterrence too drastic a solution and embracing it toosimple a response,'' the committee said in a report to their fellowbishops.   As a result, the committee added, ``the best moral evaluation isneither to condemn deterrence outright nor to accept it asself-regulating or normal.''   The report calls deterrence ``a significant factor in preventingthe use of nuclear weapons'' and said it has ``contributed to amore cautious posture of the two nuclear powers in world affairs.''   The church adopted the ``conditional acceptance'' posture in1983.   The bishops, in urging its continuation, called the meeting ofPresident Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev last December``the beginning of responsible statesmanship.''   They said it raised cautious hopes ``that an authentically newopportunity for redefining the political relationship of theworld's two major military powers may be at hand.''   The committee said the church's acceptance of nuclear deterrenceshould be based on seven points, one of which is ``significantreductions in strategic armaments, which exceed the requirements ofsecond-strike deterrence.''   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago headed the committee whichworked for two years to produce the report. The committee willcontinue to receive recommendations before issuing a final versionto be submitted to the next general meeting of American bishops, inCollegeville, Minn., June 24-27.   ``Our publics share a certain tragic destiny,'' the bishopssaid. ``We are both targets; the possibility of a future for ourchildren is always an open question because the weapons thatthreaten both nations are `absolute weapons' ... Publics can hopebut governments must act.''   Despite the ``uncertain promise'' brought about by a betterrelationship between the United States and the Soviet Union,``there stands the historical fact of major additions to thestrategic arsenals of both superpowers, weapons whose character andnumbers decidedly increase the danger of nuclear war occurring,''the report said.   ``This pattern of policy is not adequate to the moral danger ofthe age, that these arsenals, by miscalculation or mistake, willescape human control and destroy in an hour the product ofcivilizations which it has taken centuries to build and shape.''   The bishops said President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiativemust be limited to research and development and not advanced todeployment and that the anti-ballistic missile treaty should not becast aside or overridden. They said each step in SDI should firstbe evaluated for its consequences in the arms race and thatspending for the program be judged ``in relationship to the basichuman needs of the poor in our country and in other nations.''   Said the bishops: ``We cannot avoid our responsibility to liftup the moral dimensions of the choices before our world andnation.''</TEXT></DOC>
