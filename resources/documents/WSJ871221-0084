While these observers differ on how far prices will fall before stabilizing, nearly all agree they will go below Friday's close of $15.58 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That price, on the January-delivery contract, was down 26 cents from Thursday's close and brought the six-day decline to $2.93.    Many traders are selling the oil-futures market short in anticipation of the price falling, with the aim of buying back later at a lower price. But some are hedging their bets with the use of options.    &quot;We are now in a collapsing market,&quot; said Robert Boslego, president of the Boslego Corp., an oil-consulting firm in Winchester, Mass.    The market's weakness stems mainly from uncertainty about the ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to effectively do anything to relieve pressure on prices. Last week's declines came after OPEC failed to come up with a strong agreement to curb overproduction and support prices.    It appears that a major reason for the sharp recovery last Thursday after a plunge during the day to $14.90 a barrel, was the desire by traders to take profits.    They had sold oil-futures contracts short anticipating a price drop following OPEC's weak production-price agreement last Monday. After the price dropped, many were able to close out their positions at a profit by buying back contracts. The buying provided the price lift.    Because of the extreme volatility of the oil market these days, traders are seeking greater protection against unexpected price swings.    Mr. Boslego advocates selling the futures markets short, thus betting that oil prices will decline. To protect against a price rise, which could create a loss, he urges also buying a call option that gives the right -- but not the obligation -- to buy a futures contract at a specified price.    Donald Morton, vice president, energy futures, at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., Boston, offers this example: &quot;If you go short a January future at $15.98, you also buy a call option at $16, which will cost about $550, at current costs, and which gives you the right to go long.    &quot;You can go to sleep with the certainty that your short position in futures is working for you in a declining market. If the market turns around, you can take advantage of the rally by exercising the right to buy the future. If it doesn't go up, you can let the option lapse and all it has cost is you is a relatively small amount.&quot;    Opinions vary on how far oil will dip. James T. Kneafsey, president of Cambridge Commodities Corp., a trading and research firm in Cambridge, Mass., says he thinks the crude-oil price will drop to $14 to $15 a barrel, and that OPEC will take action to support the market.    &quot;Even a bad cartel, shot through with problems, as OPEC is at the moment, will pull together for the common good,&quot; he said, noting that at below $15, &quot;even OPEC gets nervous.&quot;    Mr. Boslego sees a lower floor.    &quot;According to our calculations, there is a 25% to 35% probability that crude-oil prices will close at or below $14 a barrel between March and May,&quot; he said. &quot;I personally think the probability is closer to 50%.&quot;    Peter Cardillo, trading adviser for Josephthal Co., New York, is a major dissenter from the pessimistic view on prices. &quot;I believe they they will stabilize and go higher. OPEC will take action, mostly for political considerations,&quot; he said. &quot;If the price drops to $15, as many believe, buy and add to your position.&quot;    Mr. Cardillo said: &quot;If price were based purely on supply/demand considerations, it should properly be down to around $10 to $12. . . . But severely depressed prices would cause financial problems, especially in the U.S., which would try to influence OPEC to take supportive action.&quot;    On the other hand, John O'Dea, manager of international energy futures at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said OPEC is &quot;a joke. They exist as a serious factor only in their own minds. They can't control Iran and Iraq, they overproduce, they discount prices, and they're refining oil and pushing out products that don't show up in crude statistics.&quot;    Mr. O'Dea advocates selling the market because the $15 level is going to be retested in futures, &quot;and if there is a close below that, there's a likelihood the price will drop as low as $12.&quot;    He said: &quot;OPEC lacks credibility because of the charade they've been playing for years, and there is no reason to believe that non-OPEC producers such as the U.S., Britain, Norway and Canada, for example, are going to cut production and do for OPEC what OPEC won't do for itself.&quot;    Analysts generally agreed that any action or indication of an action on the part of OPEC could have a supporting effect on the market, as could winter weather in North America and Europe.    &quot;Heating oil at the moment is very cheap,&quot; observed Cambridge's Mr. Kneafsey. &quot;A severe cold wave in the next several weeks could easily cause prices to jump $2 or more.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
