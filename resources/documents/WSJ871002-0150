But it also reminded me of something else that many people must know but from which few appear to be willing to draw the obvious conclusion. There is an extremely close analogy between Prohibition and the current laws prohibiting the use of certain drugs such as marijuana, heroin and cocaine.    The analogy is so close that many parts of Mr. Crabb's article apply directly to the illegal drugs of today. For example: &quot;But . . . folks should realize by now that not only does prohibition not work, it customarily intensifies consumption of the prohibited dreaded substance. Humans are like that; deny them something and they'll want it, even if they didn't want it before they were told they couldn't have it.&quot; Or again: &quot;Somehow that seems to be the case with any dreaded substance -- illegality makes it more available because no consistent, pervasive control is possible. A complicated, ubiquitous underground system will inevitably form like some natural phenomenon to service the desire for such substances.&quot; He could not have more accurately described the current supply network for illegal drugs.    The conclusion should be totally obvious. If Prohibition was a failure because it encouraged the consumption of the forbidden substance, eliminated the possibility of effective control of certain activities (such as sale to minors), and made lawbreakers of large numbers of otherwise law-abiding citizens, then the prohibition of marijuana, heroin, cocaine, etc. is also a failure for the same reasons. Indeed, the latter case is probably a much worse failure, since the illegality has also ruined the economy of more than one Latin American nation, and made rational foreign policy vis-a-vis these nations impossible.    It is time all of us stop kidding ourselves with expensive wars on drugs. As long as the demand is there, a supply will be there, too. The sooner all recreational drugs are made legal, the sooner we and our southern neighbors can stop paying the price.    Jim Allman   St. Louis   ---   Mr. Crabb writes with perception about the ineffectuality of Prohibition against the Demon Drink, and the way we as adults regard with horror and condemnation what we viewed as glamorous and exciting when children. The sad part is that everything he says about illicit alcohol now applies equally to illicit drugs.    Peter Sealy   New York</TEXT></DOC>
