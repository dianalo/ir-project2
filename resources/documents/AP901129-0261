WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The European Community on Thursdayimposed penalties known as anti-dumping duties on U.S. and Japaneseimports of aspartame, an artificial sweetener used in soft drinksand food.   The EC Commission said NutraSweet Co., the U.S. exporter,charged less than half in Europe for its product than in the UnitedStates causing ``material injury'' to Holland Sweetener Co, theEC's only aspartame maker.   It imposed a duty of 27.55 European currency units, or about$38, on each kilogram NutraSweet imports into the 12-nation EC andof 29.95 ECUs or $41.30 on aspartame from Japan's Ajinomoto Co.   The two companies jointly market aspartame in Europe through aSwiss venture called NutraSweet AG. Jan Bergman, president ofNutraSweet AG, protested the anti-dumping duties as unwarranted andunfair.   ``This is the highest duty ever imposed by the commission on afood product,'' he said in a statement. ``It will cause animmediate and dramatic increase in the cost of aspartame to EC foodand beverage manufacturers.   ``We are shocked,'' he said. ``We do not understand the basisfor the commission's determination and we will meet with members ofthe commission at their earliest opportunity to clarify theirposition and register our concern.''   The duties stem from an EC investigation, begun in March 3, intothe prices NutraSweet and Ajinomoto charge in the EC after acomplaint by the Dutch rival.   ``Although the EC producer increased its sales and market sharefrom nothing when it entered the market in 1988, it was faced byprice undercutting by the U.S. and Japanese exporters,'' theCommission said in a statement.   ``Unless measures were taken, the Community would be entirelydependent on one source of supply, i.e. the imports from Japan andthe USA.''   Holland Sweetener Co. General Manager Winfried Vermijs saidaspartame costs up to $70 a kilo in the EC and about $150 in theUnited States.   In a statement issued by his office in Maastricht, he welcomedthe EC duties as ``good news for the European but also the U.S.food industry for the move by the Commission guarantees thepresence in the aspartame market of more than one supplier, now andin the future.''   The EC Commission acknowledged its duties will raise prices forconsumers but said it was in the EC's``general interest ... tomaintain the presence of a Community industry in this importantproduct.''   NutraSweet Co., part of Monsanto's G.D. Searle division, has amonopoly on aspartame in the United States where its patent on theproduct expires in 1992. Dumping refers to the practice byexporters of selling goods on foreign markets at unreasonably lowprices to gain a significant market share in those markets or selloff excess production.   The EC calculated the duty on Ajinomoto Co. based onNutraSweet's prices ``as the Japanese exporter refused to provideessential information on its domestic prices and costs.''   Holland Sweetener Co. and NutraSweet are the biggest providersof aspartame in the EC where annual consumption is about 1,000tons, compared with 6,000 to 7,000 tons in the United States.   Aspartame's sweetening power far exceeds that of sugar and hasmade rapid inroads in recent years as an ingredient in light softdrinks.</TEXT></DOC>
