Meanwhile, one Republican senator was quoted as saying that ifshe were in Tower's position she would ask that the nomination bewithdrawn.   Tower was booked onto a Sunday morning network televisioninterview show and is planning a speech, probably Tuesday, at theNational Press Club.   Bush, meanwhile, told reporters in Tokyo on Saturday that he willmeet individually with 10 or more Democratic senators after hereturns to the White House Monday from a four-day Asian trip.   ``I'll do it personally and I'll do it as forcefully as I can,''the president said. ``I will encourage people to look at the facts.''   Also, Republicans worried about reports Saturday that SenateArmed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., would reopen thehearings and subpoena people who had been questioned by the FBI andwhose allegations against Tower had been included in the report,said congressional sources who requested anonymity.   Arnold Punaro, a member of the committee staff, said lateSaturday he couldn't comment on the report.   Punaro said the committee staff did meet Saturday to prepare forthis week's floor debate on the nomination, but the report ofreopening hearings was ``not in that context.''   Some Tower opponents have said perceptions that he is a drinkerand womanizer and may have conflict of interest problems are validreasons to vote against him even if there is no proof of such things.   ``That's not fair enough and that's not high enough a standardwhen it comes to the confirmation of an important nominee of thisnature,'' said Bush. ``So I have made some calls and I will betalking to whoever remains open minded.''   In Beijing, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu asserted thatDemocrats ``are getting nervous'' about the upcoming Senate voteTower and that some of them appeared to be coming around.   Bush plans to meet with the Senate Democrats at the White Houseearly on Tuesday. The Senate vote is tenatively scheduled forWednesday.   ``A lot of Democrats are leaning nicely,'' Sununu told reporters.``You might see some interesting things to try and reconstruct onthe Democratic side.'' He did not elaborate, but added, ``I have thefeeling that the Democrats are getting very nervous.''   Meanwhile, The Washington Post in Sunday's editions quotedRepublican Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas as saying that if she werein Tower's position, she would ask that the nomination be withdrawn.   ``One can have respect for the experience and expertise and stillwonder whether he could effectively serve the president ... It'ssomething he has to answer,'' the paper quoted Kassebaum as saying.She said she would withhold her decision on his nomination until shereads the latest FBI report on Tower.   Sununu would not say which Democrats had been invited to the 7:15a.m. White House meeting, but indicated it was more than just a few.   Among the Democrats who said Friday they have not decided how tovote when the Tower nomination reaches the Senate floor was LloydBentsen, a veteran of many close political encounters with both Bushand Tower in years of Texas politics, and Howell Heflin of Alabama.   The decision to assign a high-profile role to Tower and have thepresident exert the power of private Oval Office meetings is part ofa battle plan worked out with Senate Republican leaders in an effortto salvage the nomination or, at least, save face for a GOPpresident on the job only a month.   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas detailed part of theplan on Friday, hours after members of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee dealt Tower, a former colleague and one-time chairman, acrushing blow.   The committee voted 11-9 along party lines late Thursday torecommend that the full Senate reject the Tower nomination.   ``I cannot in good conscience vote to put an individual at thetop of the chain of command when his history of excessive drinkingis such that he would not be selected to command a missile wing, aSAC bomber squadron or a Trident missile submarine,'' said Sen. SamNunn, D-Ga., chairman of the committee, before other Democratsechoed his view.   Nunn also was booked onto a Sunday talk show, one airing inWashington in a time slot just before the show featuring Towerbegins on a rival network.   On Friday, Tower met at the White House with Dole and VicePresident Dan Quayle for a strategy session.   Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate, meaning Bush mustpick up at least five Democrats to assure Tower's confirmation. Dolesaid he believed all 45 Republicans were behind Tower.   Meanwhile, in Minneapolis, Quayle said Saturday the Bushadministration is seeking ``five good Democratic senators'' tosalvage Tower's nomination.   ``Hopefully, we can find five Democratic senators to come forthand say they not only know John Tower but they feel he is capableand qualified,'' Quayle told a news conference. He traveled toMinneapolis to speak at a GOP fundraiser.   The Bush administration, Quayle said, will not ``throw in thetowel on the John Tower nomination.''   Dole said the White House is preparing a summary of theconfidential FBI file on Tower that can be released to the public inhopes of demonstrating that allegations against him are baseless.   Tower has been dogged by charges of excessive drinking andwomanizing as well as conflict-of-interest questions related to hislucrative contract work for various defense contractors.   If the strategy of pressing the Democrats to present solid factsfor a vote against Tower doesn't work, the Republicans will be readywith the charges of partisanship that marked the Armed ServicesCommittee session Thursday.   ``This is going to make it much more difficult to put together abipartisan coalition for defense and foreign policy,'' said Sen.William Cohen, R-Maine.</TEXT></DOC>
