(part five in a series on object-oriented programming)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Johnston, Stuart J.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Polymorphism, or 'many forms,' is a concept that add power to theconcept of late binding of objects and to object-orientedprogramming (OOP).andP;  When polymorphism is combined with late ordynamic binding, it helps move object-oriented programming closerto the ideal of truly generic code.andP;  OOP techniques can be appliedto programming areas in which a code element can be conceptualizedas an object.andP;  OOP and graphical interfaces are not inextricablytied together, although one of the key uses for OOP with DOS andOS-2 will be to simplify programming Windows and PresentationManager applications.andP;  With OOP, programmers need not care how atask is handled inside an object.andP;  They only need to know that theobject does what is desired when it is sent the correct message.andO;Multiple inheritance, the capability of an object to inheritcharacteristics from more than one parent, is on the OOP horizon.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Object-Oriented LanguagesProgrammingComputer ScienceApplications.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Multiple inheritance in mathematics.
