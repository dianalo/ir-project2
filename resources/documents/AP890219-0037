Why did Hudson hide from Christian the secret that went to bedwith them for eight months: that the movie star had AIDS?   ``I don't know why he did it,'' Christian reflected. ``He tookthat to the grave with him. I don't know if he just couldn't facethe fact that he was dying. A lot of people don't believe in theirmortality when they're famous. You see your image up there on thescreen and maybe he thought he would live forever.''   Or maybe, he said, Hudson was used to having others handle hisproblems.   ``He had been a star since he was 23. Everything in his life wasdelegated,'' Christian said in an interview. ``I think he had somehelp in making the decision not to tell me. But even if others weretrying to influence him, he should have been man enough to tell me.''   Christian, 35, who sued Hudson's estate and secretary foremotional distress, was awarded $14.5 million Wednesday and anadditional $7.25 million in punitive damages Friday.   Born in Hollywood and raised in Southern California, Christianthought of becoming a baseball player, tried being a rock musicianand, with his blond good looks, dabbled in acting and modeling. Hewas working on a music history project and volunteering in politicalcampaigns when he met Hudson in 1982.   He maintains that the actor's fame meant ``almost nothing'' tohim. Living in Hollywood, he had gone to high school with severalactors.   ``Fame for me was a turnoff,'' he said. ``I had met a lot ofstars who were in love with themselves, and I had no idea if Rockwould be shallow.   ``But the first time we spent in this apartment, listening tomusic, I almost forgot he was famous. He was so really down toearth. He made me feel at ease.''   Later, when they became live-in lovers, he said, ``I didn't thinkabout the fame much. Sometimes it was fun to be caught in theafterglow of it. We would go out to dinner and someone would ask himfor an autograph.''   His sweet memories turn bitter when he discusses what he nowknows _ that Hudson concealed his AIDS diagnosis from him while theycontinued to have sex.   Hudson, 58, died on Oct. 5, 1985, three months after the publicand Christian learned he had the deadly, sexually transmittabledisease.   ``He made a tragic decision not to tell me,'' said Christian.``Aside from that he was a very nice, generous man. But it'soutrageous. I really resent the fact he didn't tell me.''   Christian has tested negative for exposure to the AIDS virus butsaid he fears contracting the disease. ``If I'm carrying AIDS, I'mdead,'' he said. ``If I don't come down with it, he has put methrough three years of hell.''   He has been celibate since he learned of Hudson's diagnosis, hesaid.   He said filing suit was traumatic. ``I initially asked the estatefor $300,000,'' Christian recalled. ``I said, `If I get AIDS, I haveno health insurance, and I'll need that,' but they refused.''   Christian said the lawsuit's message is simple: People with AIDShave a duty to warn their sexual partners.   The jury's verdict probably will be appealed, but Christian said:``The message has already gone out. The impact that jury had can'tbe erased. Even if I don't get a dime out of it, it doesn't matter.''   He vowed to contribute a large portion of his award to AIDSgroups, mainly hospices. ``Maybe I'll be able to do what Rock shouldhave done,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
