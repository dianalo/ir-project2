Moscow accepted a Romanian invitation for Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to visit in January, the officialSoviet news agency Tass said Sunday. But it remains to be seenwhether Moldavia will be on the agenda.   On the surface, Moscow is only delighted with the revolutionthat ousted and executed Ceausescu, who was publicly if politelychided for his corrupt nepotism by Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev on a visit two years ago.   Romania's new president, Ion Iliescu, is an acquaintance ofGorbachev from days when both worked in Communist youth movements,East bloc diplomats say.   The Soviet president underlined the chumminess in acongratulatory telephone call to Iliescu last week, an item givenprominent publicity in the Romanian newspapers.   Iliescu, 59, a once prominent communist who fell afoul ofCeausescu in 1971 and spent the next 18 years in the politicalwilderness, is well liked by Soviets in Bucharest, who say he has aRussian wife.   ``He speaks good Russian, English and French and is overall acultured man,'' a Soviet diplomat smiled approvingly.   But both the Soviets and Iliescu, who spent time as party leaderin the northern city of Iasi near the border with Soviet Moldavia,must know that the new friendliness could turn sour if people onboth sides of the border start wanting to unite.   ``It's a key issue and one that everybody will be watchingclosely,'' said a Western diplomat who asked not to be identifed.``The Soviets must be concerned.''   East bloc diplomats, asking not to be identifed, act as if thereis no potential problem.   ``Under the old regime, every day there was an article pushingtheir nationalism,'' said one. ``That will change now.''   Another expressed confidence that the borders drawn in 1940 whenthe Soviets used a secret protocol to the Hitler-Stalin pact toannex part of Moldavia would stay as they are.   ``It's history,'' he said. ``Yes, we've now admitted thatRomanian and Moldavian are in effect the same language, but I don'tthink the borders will shift.''   Ceausescu himself drew attention to the Moldavian issue when hesaid at the congress that unanimously re-elected him president onlya month ago that the Hitler-Stalin pact should be annulled and``all the consequences'' of it eliminated, possibly suggestingMoscow should relinquish control of Moldavia. Moldavis is knownunder Romanian rule as Bessarabia.   That remark was typical both of the nationalism fed byCeausescu's dreams of a great Romania with himself its undisputedheroic leader, and of the distance he always kept from Moscow.   Ceausescu refused to take part in the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasionof Czechoslovakia, ignored Kremlin bans on trading with the Westand refused to station Warsaw Pact troops on his territory.   Once Gorbachev's reforms took hold of the Soviet Union,Ceausescu reduced relations to a bare minimum of trade.   Intellectuals invited to Moscow would find it close toimpossible to get permission to go. Romanian officials questionedon Soviet reforms sneered and implied that the Soviets were noliberals if they had annexed Moldavia.   It seems the Kremlin's only requirement as its former satellitesbreak away is a promise to remain in the Warsaw Pact alliance.   On Friday, Corneliu Bogdan, a fluent Russian, English and Frenchspeaker who is deputy foreign minister, duly gave that assurance,following the pattern set by Solidarity and civic forum, theopposition movements that now share power with Communists in Polandand Czechoslovakia.   But many Romanians perceive Communism as a system imported fromthe Russians who also ``stole'' Moldavia, and their resentmentcould boil over into anti-Soviet policies and demands for their oldterritory.   With just a week passed since Ceausescu was ousted, no diplomatsor Romanians can forecast the outcome of the promised freeelections.   Already, however, conservative parties banned after theCommunist takeover in 1947 are re-emerging. These groups have astrong strain of nationalism.   Romania's new leaders might therefore be less amenable to theSoviets, who face their own problems, with the strength of thePopular Front movement in Moldavia pushing for more independencefrom Moscow, and the decision by the National Congess, last week todeclare the secret protocol of the Hitler-Stalin pact null and void.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Alison Smale, Vienna bureau chief for TheAssociated Press, has covered European and Soviet affairs since1980.</TEXT></DOC>
