In addition, further work is defined that includes comprehensiveemissions characterization and impact analysis for a wide range of operatingconditions and types of coals which would expedite environmental planningfor future coal gasification projects by TVA or others. This plan coversthe environmental and workplace safety activities already planned andbudgeted for fiscal years 1979 through 1983. These activities includecharacterization of all effluent streams, preventing potential occupationalexposures to hazardous agents, and workplace safety. A separate supplementaryprogram proposed herein identifies work which would require additionalfunding. The supplementary projects cover secondary pollutant formationin air (ozone and photochemical oxidants), wastewater treatment processevaluation and toxicity testing, alternative wastewater treatment controltechnologies, radiological characterization of noneffluent process streams,additional occupational exposure instrumentation and epidemiologicalstudies, and system safety analysis. 37 refs., 2 figs., 50 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
