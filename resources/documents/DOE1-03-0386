The solubilities of {sup 241}Am,{sup 239+240}Pu and {sup 137}Cs as a function of environmental conditionswere observed in sediment-water and sand-water systems. Particular attentionwas given to the pH, Esub(H), CO{sub 2} pressure and action of microorganisms.Numerous leaching experiments were carried out. The similarity in behaviourof Am and Eu on one hand, and Cs and Pu on the other hand is remarkable.A correlation was noticed between the differences of the solubility ofAm, Pu and Cs and the differences of the uptake by food crops. Differencesin uptake are more pronounced than differences in solubility.</TEXT></DOC>
