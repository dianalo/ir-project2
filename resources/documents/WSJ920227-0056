Salmonella contamination of eggs is a widespread publichealth problem. Consumption of raw or undercookedcontaminated eggs can lead to stomach ache, diarrhea,vomiting and fever that can endanger the lives of infants,the elderly and infirm, and disable the healthy for a fewdays. The 50,000 cases of salmonella poisoning reported eachyear are believed to provide a gross underestimate of theextent of the salmonella problem.</LP><TEXT>   At present, there is no way to know if an egg iscontaminated short of breaking it open and culturing its yolkovernight to see if salmonella multiply to detectable levels.   Researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in NewMexico, where the atomic bomb was developed, said they hadsuccessfully detected salmonella-infected eggs using a devicedesigned to detect chemical and biological agents inartillery shells and other munitions. The device wasdeveloped to help verify compliance with arms controltreaties.   The inspection device consists basically of two smallsound transducers, each about the size of a quarter. Onetransducer serves as a speaker that converts electricalsignals into sound and the other as a microphone thatconverts sounds back into electrical signals.   An egg is placed between the two transducers. The speakerpings it with a pulse of sound of a specific frequency. Theping causes the egg to resonate like a musical tuning fork.The microphone picks up the reverberations and reveals thefrequency at which the eggshell is resonating.   &quot;The eggshell's natural resonance is affected byconditions in the egg white and yolk,&quot; the laboratoryexplained in an announcement. &quot;Changes in the viscosity,density and other properties of the egg white and yolk canalter the frequency at which the eggshell resonates,&quot; thelaboratory said.   The researchers found that normal, uncontaminated eggsresonated at a single frequency of 830 hertz or cycles persecond, which is a high G-sharp. But if the eggs wereinfected with salmonella the shell also resonated at asecond, higher frequency in addition to the G-sharp.   So far, the researchers have been able to spot about 25%of the eggs that were contaminated by deliberately injectingthem with salmonella. &quot;We hope to fine-tune our measurementsto pull out 100% of the infected eggs,&quot; said Roger Johnston,a member of the research team, who described the device at ascience fair in Santa Fe, N.M., sponsored by the Los Alamoslaboratory.   The idea of using the acoustical detection technique foreggs stemmed from a conversation Dr. Johnston had with anacquaintance at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One ofDr. Johnston's jobs with the process technology group at LosAlamos is to find biomedical applications for the lab's vaststore of technology. The FDA scientist had asked if the LosAlamos researchers had anything that could deal with thesalmonella problem. Queries around the lab led Dr. Johnstonto Dipen Sinha of the electronics research group, who wasdeveloping the acoustical detection method for weaponsinspection.   &quot;We are using very much the same type of equipment now tolook at eggs,&quot; said Dr. Sinha.   The researchers said they must still prove the system inthe field to make sure it can detect eggs naturallycontaminated with salmonella.   The detection device has been reduced to fit in abriefcase and probably could be manufactured for about $200,a laboratory spokesman said. On a poultry-and-egg farmproduction line it could screen an egg every few seconds, thelaboratory suggested, and probably could be adapted to detectcracked eggs, eggs with double yolks and fertilized eggs.   The Los Alamos laboratory said it has applied for a patenton the device.</TEXT></DOC>
