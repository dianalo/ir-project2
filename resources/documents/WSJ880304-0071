The maker of drip-watering systems said it is unaware of any current takeover moves involving the company.    Under GardenAmerica's plan, shareholders of the company's common stock on March 7 will receive rights that, in the event of certain takeovers, enable holders to buy stock in the surviving company at half-price.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, GardenAmerica shares closed at $15, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
