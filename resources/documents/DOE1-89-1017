This is shown analyticallyfor a simple structure, the king post truss, for which previous experimentalinvestigations have established the occurrence of instability throughmode interaction under certain circumstances. In this paper an attemptis made to explain these instabilities, which are either caused by resonanceor by flutter.</TEXT></DOC>
