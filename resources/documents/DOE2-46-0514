A GIS is an established technic, yet has unsolvedphenomena, one of which is considerable instability of the insulationcharacteristics shown when a conductor supporting insulator (spacer)is under DC stress. As a result, it was revealed that the maximum densityof accumulated charge could be estimated by numerical calculation ofthe electric field on the condition that the normal directional componentof the surface electric field of the spacer, En was 0 and the dielectricstrength when the spacer was charged could be evaluated by the valuetaking into consideration the maximum density of the accumulated electriccharge. Consequently the shape of the spacer which had no charge accumulationwas proposed. (15 figs, 17 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
