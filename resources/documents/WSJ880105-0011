Stock prices fell in Tokyo as individual investors led selling prompted by concern over the dollar. The dollar opened the new year in Tokyo more than three yen below its close Dec. 28, the last day of 1987 trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues ended the half-day session down 346.96 points to 21217.04. The exchange's first section index fell 35.39 to 1690.44. Volume was estimated at a thin 170 million shares.    In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, share prices rebounded as the dollar continued to recover. The Nikkei index rose 330.44 points to 21547.48 at the end of the morning session.    One trader said foreign exchange worries Monday spread bearish sentiment throughout the market, hurting even sectors such as utilities, usually perceived as benefiting from a weaker dollar because of the resulting lower yen cost of importing energy.    He said dealings were thin, however, partly because investors were wary of making any major moves as Tokyo was the first major market to launch 1988 trading.    The market was lower across the board, with the exception of such mining shares as Mitsui Mining, Mitsubishi Metal, and Dowa Mining, which were helped by expectations that the price of gold would get a boost from foreign exchange jitters.    Mitsui Mining ended up 30 yen at 387 ($3.17), Mitsubishi Metal closed up 32 at 722, and Dowa Mining closed up 27 at 477. Another winner in the mining sector was Nippon Mining, up 35 to 452.    Traders said share prices recovered moderately in the last hour of trading, but only because early sellers had finished their moves in the face of the yen's appreciation.    In London, share prices were firmer near the day's peak at the close as participants reacted to the steadier dollar and a firm early trend on Wall Street.    The Financial Times 30-share index closed up 28.7 points at 1402.0. Volume was a modest 273.2 million shares, up from 229.8 million shares on the last day of trading Thursday. The 100-share index was up 34.8 points at 1747.5.    Dealers said the market was underpinned during the whole trading session by the dollar's steadiness, following reports of intervention by several central banks to support the U.S. unit. The earlier slide in the dollar pressured London shares last week, with the 100-share index slumping 47.1 points Thursday.    &quot;We went down on little (trading) volume on Thursday because of the dollar and we came up today on equally little volume because of the dollar,&quot; one dealer said.    The dollar was quoted at 122.85 yen late Monday in London, up from 120.50 yen at the opening in Tokyo earlier.    The dollar's steadiness helped British companies with large dollar earnings. Only six of the 100-index stocks were showing losses at the close.    Among the dollar-earners, Imperial Chemical Industries was up 27 pence at #11.07 ($20.80), Glaxo Holdings rose 18 to #10 and BTR was up 3 pence at 276 pence ($5.19).    British Petroleum new shares were heavily traded, prompting speculation that the Kuwait Investment Office was building on its previously declared 18.34% stake in BP. Registered BP new shares were unchanged at 70.5 pence. Regular BP shares were up 9 at 259.    Share prices sank about 5% on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on concern about the dollar.    Also hurting the market were reports that the Bonn government was considering emergency measures to stimulate the economy. The talk fanned increasingly pessimistic assessments of West Germany's economic prospects, which are being damaged by the low dollar.    Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Monday he doesn't see any reason for further measures to stimulate the economy. But the chancellor's remarks followed a statement by Economics Minister Martin Bangemann last week that indicated he would, if necessary, consider additional measures to reach &quot;adequate&quot; growth in 1988.    Declines were across the board and also affected retailers and other non-export businesses that had been regarded as protected from the dollar.    In auto issues, Daimler-Benz was down 43 marks to 532 ($337), while Bayerische Motoren Werke was off 18 to 429, and Volkswagen slipped 16.3 to 208.2.    Among banks, Deutsche Bank sank 14.5 to 373.5, while Dresdner Bank slipped 10 to 322, and Commerzbank fell 9.5 to 204.5.    In other European markets, stocks fell in Paris, Brussels, Zurich, Stockholm, Milan and Amsterdam as the dollar hovered near record lows.    Traders in Paris worried about the dollar and the decline in Tokyo share prices. In Zurich, the weaker dollar kept dealings unusually quiet, dealers said. Even though the dollar regained some ground late in the Zurich session, many investors weren't convinced that the dollar's problems were over and stayed away from the market.    Stocks also fell in Sydney and Hong Kong, but rose in Singapore and Manila. Markets were closed in Taipei and Wellington.    In Sydney, shares retreated on fear about the fall in Tokyo. Volume was the lowest in 17 months. Banking and gold issues suffered the biggest falls, while diversified mining stocks also weakened.    ---   Winners and Losers   The weekly list of best and worst performers on world stock markets was unavailable. </TEXT></DOC>
