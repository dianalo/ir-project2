U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced the accord lateWednesday, hailing it as ``an important step towards giving U.S.firms in Japan access comparable to the access Japanese firms enjoyin the United States.''   The settlement ended four months of bargaining over U.S. demandsfor greater access to the Japanese market.   Negotiators had been holding marathon talks in Tokyo over thepast two weeks trying to meet a Wednesday deadline. Had thediscussions failed to resolve the dispute, the United States couldhave retaliated by imposing higher tariffs on Japanese products.   While the exact language of the agreement was still beingreviewed by both sides, U.S. officials expressed satisfaction thattheir major demands had been met.   Hills said the Japanese had agreed to remove barriers blockingU.S. companies from offering telephone services, such as voice mailand electronic banking.   The agreement also removed barriers preventing the sale directlyto customers of a type of telephone device known as network channelterminating equipment. This device allows signals from businessequipment such as computers to be transmitted over telephone lines.   The potential Japanese market in the two areas was estimated tobe more than $3 billion annually. U.S. companies hope to gain asignificant portion of the market because of their wide lead inmany telecommunications fields.   ``We are significantly ahead of the Japanese in experience andefficiency in providing these services. Given the significantlowering of bureaucratic obstacles, we are going to do prettywell,'' said one U.S. trade official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Both sides were negotiating under the Aug. 1 deadline set lastMarch 30 for resolving the dispute.   Without an agreement, Hills was authorized to begin a processthat could have resulted in economic retaliation against Japaneseproducts sold in this country equal to the amount of estimated lostsales facing American firms.   Telecommunications has been a major source of trade tensionbetween the United States and Japan. The 1988 U.S. trade actrequires an annual review of all trade agreements in this area andallows for retaliation if the United States finds the Japanese arenot living up to prior agreements.   Last year, the United States threatened to impose tariffs onJapanese imports unless the Tokyo government changed regulationsaffecting the use of cellular telephones and some radio servicesoffered by Motorola Inc.   The agreement on telecommunications equipment is the latest in aseries of deals struck between the two nations in an effort tolower trade tensions. Earlier this year, the Japanese agreed toexpand market access for U.S. and other foreign companies in theareas of timber products, satellites and super computers.   In addition, the two nations reached agreement on abroad-ranging accord aimed at attacking structural barriers in bothcountries that have been targeted as a primary reason for the $49billion trade deficit the United States ran up with Japan in 1989.That represented nearly half the total U.S. shortfall of $109.4billion for the year.</TEXT></DOC>
