<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-18-0666 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the field welding of a pipe line, the pipe position is fixed; weldingposture changes in sequence as the welding proceeds on; Uranami weldingis necessary; welding equipment must be moved joint by joint; all ofthese make the automation difficult. An automation system of pipelinewelding (all poature uranami)was developed. Since 1984, full automaticwelding apparatus respectively for regular steel pipe, s/s pipe, andsleeve type joint was started. Except the handling of valves of oil hydraulicpump and the mounting and detaching of the welding unit, all operationsof weld line copying and welding were automatically applied by the computercontrol. This reached to roughly 1200 joints by 1987 which confirmedthe following facts. Weld qualityentirely satisfies the joint requirementsspecified by the Gas Working regulations, and passed the 2nd. class standardof JIS-Z-3104 (Radio beam transmission test). As for a work efficiency,arc time for SGP 400 A is 10 - 16 min which is greatly shorter. (14 figs,1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
