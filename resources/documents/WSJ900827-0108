While Turkey has refrained from military involvement, ithas cut off two Iraqi oil pipelines across its territory,imposed a trade ban and prohibited neighboring Iraq fromusing Turkish roads or airspace to transport goods.   Official sources and commentators suggest Turkey is takingan active role in the crisis now so it will be listened tolater. The reasoning goes this way:   The U.S. appears determined to bring down Iraq's SaddamHussein and make the Persian Gulf oil fields secure. Thiswill probably lead to war and, eventually, a peaceconference. And Turkey would like to sit at the conferencetable to make sure that its national interests aren'tjeopardized and that an independent Kurdistan doesn't emerge.   An estimated 20 million Kurds live in an area where theborders of Turkey, the Soviet Union, Iran, Iraq and Syriaconverge. Turkey has the largest group, an estimated 10million out of its total population of 55 million. Severalthousand guerrillas have been fighting since 1984 for anindependent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.                                                                                                          HAVE FOOD, WON'T TRAVEL                                                                                                          Finding many doors on the European continent closed tothem, big British food-retailing chains such as Sainsbury,Tesco, Gateway, Argyll and Asda are storming the weaker gatesof the U.K.'s own corner grocers and independentsupermarkets. Instead of pushing their shopping carts acrossborders, the British groups are stocking up on U.K. sites for&quot;superstores.&quot; The new-generation supermarkets, madeappealing with high-margin fresh produce, are proving moreprofitable than operating comparable big stores on thecontinent, analysts say.

Hundreds of thousands of HongKong residents are seeking second passports before theBritish colony reverts to Chinese hands in 1997. Manycountries make immigration easier for those willing to investmoney, a factor that has spawned a sizable local industrytouting such plans.

Its economy is incrisis and its population is frightened by the prospect of awinter of starvation.   Shops and gas stations are empty, foreign investors aredeterred by huge foreign debt, and the new, freely electedparliament can't agree on what kind of government will runthe country.   An increasing number of Bulgarians, frustrated by emptystores and worried by the prospect of chronic shortagesduring the harsh Balkan winter, are lining up outsideconsulates for emigrant visas.   &quot;This country is really on the ropes,&quot; one Westerndiplomat said. &quot;People are getting out for whatever reasonthey can -- and I wouldn't want to be here this winter if Iwere Bulgarian.&quot;   Like many of its East European neighbors, Bulgaria lastyear ended the Communist monopoly on power. But while othercountries in Eastern Europe voted the Communists out ofpower, in Bulgaria the party renamed itself Socialist andswept to victory at free elections in June.
