DALY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Kitty Dukakis, the wife of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis,is being treated for alcohol problems triggered by her husband'sloss to George Bush in the 1988 presidential election, the governorsaid Monday.   Mrs. Dukakis was not known to be dependent on alcohol until thegovernor's statement, but she has had a history of addiction to dietpills. She entered a Minnesota treatment center in 1982, where shesaid she conquered her dependency.   ``Until shortly after Election Day on Nov. 8, Kitty had never hada problem with alcohol,'' Dukakis said in a statement.   He said that since the presidential campaign Mrs. Dukakis, 52,used alcohol ``in excessive quantities ... on a limited number ofoccasions while at home.''   ``As she has now discovered, whether it comes in a bottle or issolid, if you are chemically dependent, you are chemicallydependent,'' Dukakis said at a news conference.   Dukakis, who does not smoke and rarely drinks even a glass ofwine, said his wife had entered the Edgehill Newport facility inNewport, R.I., on Sunday and will stay there about a month.   ``She recognizes it. It was her decision to go into treatment,''Dukakis said, adding that he and their children supported her choice.   ``It is a disease from which you never recover; you're alwaysrecovering,'' he said, calling her alcohol problem anothermanifestation of her underlying chemical dependency.   Mrs. Dukakis said in July 1987, early in her husband'spresidential campaign, that she had recovered five years earlierfrom a 26-year addiction to mild amphetamines she began taking as ateen-ager to control her weight.   She won praise for her candor and became an active campaigner,often appearing as a surrogate for Dukakis.   The couple was at home in suburban Brookline during the weekend,and there was no specific incident or accident that prompted thedecision to seek treatment, according to Dukakis spokesman JamesDorsey.   Mrs. Dukakis' problem was caused by ``a combination of physicalexhaustion, the stress of the campaign effort and the post-electionletdown,'' the governor said.   ``We know how loved and respected she is both here in thecommonwealth and across the nation _ and she is grateful for thelove and support she has received from so many good and decentpeople,'' Dukakis said.   Dorsey said the problem _ which he refused to characterize asalcoholism _ flared up in the three months since the election anddid not involve a renewed use of drugs other than alcohol.   Mrs. Dukakis has been prominent in the fight to educateyoungsters against the perils of drug and alcohol abuse.   Since the presidential defeat, Mrs. Dukakis has launched a careeras an author and lecturer and has not appeared at her husband's sideon several occasions when she might have been expected.   On Jan. 3, for example, when Dukakis made the surpriseannouncement that he would not seek a fourth term as governor, someobservers remarked on the fact that Mrs. Dukakis was not present.Dukakis left open the possibility that he would run for the WhiteHouse again in 1992.   In 1983, Mrs. Dukakis took the lead in the state's ``GreatAmerican Smokeout'' and announced that she was quitting cigarettesafter smoking since age 14. But she quickly became a chronic quitter.   Dukakis said that when his wife gets out of Edgehill, ``I expectthat she will resume a very active and busy schedule.''</TEXT></DOC>
