Travel agents and airlines say that many flights to Tokyo, Hong Kong and other popular Asian destinations are virtually sold out for the next few weeks.    &quot;Getting across the Pacific right now is a mess,&quot; says Stephen Taylor, chief operating officer for Lifeco Travel Services, a big Houston-based agency. &quot;The flights are just ungodly tight.&quot;    The crunch is the result of the boom in travel to Asia, where air traffic has risen more than 20% in each of the past two years. &quot;It's easily the fastest-growing region in the world,&quot; says James Carey, senior vice president at Airline Economics Inc., a Washington consulting firm.    Agents say travelers who will fly at off hours or take circuitous routes can probably get a flight relatively soon. But if they want to go on a popular day or nonstop -- as most people do -- they may have to wait weeks.    Karen Torello, manager of Holiday Travel Service in Burlingame, Calif., says one of her clients had to wait three weeks before she could fly directly to Manila from Los Angeles. &quot;People are just shocked when you tell them how bad it is,&quot; she says.    Many are also shocked by the cost. Although airlines say they haven't drastically raised fares to the Far East, some carriers concede that many discounts have dried up lately.    The problem is likely to last until mid-September, when travel usually slows, but winter is expected to be busy again.    More Airport Travelers    Fly Through Customs UNABLE TO EXPAND its staff sufficiently, the Customs Service has come up with a solution to dealing with the increase in international travel: Inspect fewer passengers.    At least that's what the agency is testing in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Detroit airports. Instead of pushing harder to get more personnel, the agency has drafted a plan calling for fewer inspections. &quot;The concept is selectivity,&quot; the plan says.    Mighty selective, in fact. Under one work-saving trick, the agency is getting complete passenger information from the airline on particular flights. Even with just names and addresses the Customs Service can plug into a computer and search for criminal records or data that would send up a red flag. If the profile of the travelers is favorable, the agency then whisks the whole plane load through customs on arrival in the U.S. with minimum examination.    The plan might be welcome news for tired, law-abiding travelers, but it might be even better news for drug traffickers and the like. &quot;Theoretically, I think that's correct,&quot; says a Customs official, &quot;but until we've run this strategy awhile, we won't know&quot; how effective it will be.    At least some in Congress are uneasy about this solution. &quot;Let's face it,&quot; says Rep. Charles Rangel (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. &quot;The borders are a sieve. . . . I do hope they revisit this and recognize the need for more manpower and resources.&quot;    It Costs More to Cool Off    In Canadian Rental Cars    WHEN YOU RENT a car in the U.S., you normally get air conditioning without paying extra. That's not the case in Canada.    Budget Rent a Car, Avis and Tilden Car andamp; Truck Rental all charge 6 Canadian dollars (US$5.08) a day extra for air conditioning. Hertz says its charge for air varies with the location.    In most cases, those charges raise the total rental cost by more than 10%. And it's essentially a hidden charge for anyone used to renting in the U.S.; when you ask for a price quote, the reservations clerk in Canada won't necessarily tell you the price doesn't include air conditioning.    A Hertz spokeswoman says the extra charge is justified because Canada imposes a one-time $100 user tax on cars with air conditioning. And everyone in the business likes to point out that Canada isn't known for hot weather. One problem with this argument: Like a lot of northern locations, Canada has its hot days, too. In Toronto, for instance, the average high temperature last month was 81 degrees, including one day when the mercury hit 91.    Car rental companies &quot;try to scrounge out whatever money they can,&quot; says Herbert J. Teison, editor of Travel Smart newsletter in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. &quot;If they can make a few bucks charging extra for air conditioning, they will.&quot;    But the consumer who wants air conditioning without paying extra stands a good chance of getting his wish. Budget, for example, says 75% of its Canadian fleet is equipped with air conditioning. So the chances are three-in-four that you'll get a cool car, even if you ask don't ask for one.    Odds and Ends    THE THREE TOP U.S. airlines control more than half of the domestic passenger traffic for the first time ever. American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines carried 51.9% of the total traffic during the first six months of 1989. In the year-earlier period, when Eastern Airlines wasn't hobbled by a strike, the top three controlled just 47.6%. . . . First there were nonsmoker hotel rooms. Now there are nonsmoker rental cars, though they're not going over as big. In Reno, Nev., Avis offers cars that it says have never been smoked in. &quot;This is still being done on a test basis,&quot; a spokeswoman says. Some locations have found it too unwieldy. Hertz doesn't offer no-smokers, noting that &quot;if a customer has a passenger who smokes, you've created a smoking car.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
