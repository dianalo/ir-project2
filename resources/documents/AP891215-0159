LANE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three infants abandoned in the area in 10days, including one found with a poignant note, may have been leftby their parents because of financial and emotional pressures ofthe season, specialists said Friday.   ``It would seem that somebody who abandons a newborn is somebodywho's totally overwhelmed and feels they have no resources,'' saidIrene Goldenberg, a family psychologist at UCLA's NeuropsychiatricInstitute. ``Abandoning a baby is a case of pure panic. It's like asuicidal impulse.''   The three infants, now in foster homes, seem to support findingsthat child abandonment has grown as much as 300 percent since 1980.   On Wednesday, a 5-month-old boy was found behind a stateDisability Insurance Claims Office building along with a note thatsaid, ``Dear friends, please look after my son. ... I simply can'tgive him the kind of care he deserves. I know you can.'' It waswritten by the father, who signed his name but has not been located.   The same day, a man who stepped into the morning cold to get hisnewspaper found a newborn girl wrapped in blue cloth and placedinside a cardboard box in a gutter. Hospital workers named theinfant Noel.   A girl believed to be 2 to 3 days old was found Dec. 7 at amotel in suburban Van Nuys, apparently left on a bed by a youngcouple who told the hotel desk they needed to rent a room briefly,police said. The only clue to her identity was the paper hospitalgown decorated with pink-and-blue teddy bears she wore.   While experts don't see a rise in child abandonment during theholiday season, they say that a time of merriment and celebrationof family unity can prompt feelings of severe depression andhopelessness fron those without support.   People who give up their children in hopes that a stranger willgive them a better life may be relying on the Christmas spirit ofgiving, said Sylvia Pizzini of the Child Welfare Services programof the California State Department of Social Services.   ``People may feel others are more generous at Christmas,'' shesaid. ``They count on the spirit of goodwill.''   As police officers searched for the parents of the threefoundlings, Los Angeles social workers on Friday held the annualAdoption Day, on which 25 families received adoption decrees for 28children.   Many public and private agencies offer adoption services whereparents can surrender children they are unable to care for, butpeople continue to abandon children anonymously because they areashamed of their inability to raise the child, said Alex Morales,spokesman for the Children's Bureau of Los Angeles. The bureauplaces abandoned children in foster homes.   ``It is so much more socially negative to make that move,'' hesaid. ``It's somehow more permissible to leave a child with a note.Maybe what goes on in the mother's mind is that she takes this stepbecause of the social stigma that she's not a good mother.''   Morales said although babies being left on doorsteps get farmore publicity, many parents leave their children with strangers orrelatives and disappear, only to return later to claim the child.   ``It seems like drugs are playing a big part in thatphenomenon,'' Morales said. ``We see children abandoned because aparent is so caught up in their drug involvement they can't attendto the needs of their children.''   After children are placed in foster homes or relatives are givencustody, the parent returns to be reunited with his or her child,only to disappear again later, he said.   ``Often they are locatable, which leads you to conclude thatthey want to be found,'' said Ms. Pizzini. ``That biological tie isthere through thick and thin.''</TEXT></DOC>
