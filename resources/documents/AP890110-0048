VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Reagan administration proposes modestspending increases in education, health and poverty programs butwants to save money by cutting school lunch subsidies and homeheating assistance along with some student loans and grants.   In its proposed 1990 budget unveiled Monday, the administrationoutlined a 5.7 percent increase for the Department of Health andHuman Services and a 3 percent boost in outlays for education.   Health and Human Services, the largest federal department, wouldreceive $424.4 billion in 1990.   The budget called for a 13 percent increase in spending for AIDSresearch and prevention, raising that to $1.4 billion.   However, the budget proposed saving some $935 million by cuttingoff school lunch subsidies that benefit middle and upper classstudents. Currently all students, regardless of family income, areentitled to school lunches subsidized by the government.   But under the administration plan, students whose family incomeis 185 percent higher than the poverty line _ about $21,553 for afamily of four last year _ will be on their own.   Overall, the government will spend an estimated $5 billion onschool and day care center lunch programs this year. Cutting off thesubsidy for middle and upper income families would cost them about28 cents per lunch, the administration estimated.   A group pushing for nutrition programs for the poor attacked theproposal as ``inexcusable.''   ``No matter how they defend it, these proposals will mean thedenial of millions of meals to needy children in schools and daycare centers,'' said Robert J. Fersh of the Food Research ActionCenter.   The administration also proposed to save $283 million by reducingmoney to help the poor pay their heating and light bills to a $1.1billion spending authority.   ``Now that the energy crisis has ended, low-income households arespending smaller and smaller portions of their income on heat,'' thebudget document said.   Meanwhile, education lobbying groups said they hoped George Bush,who ran on the pledge of being the ``education president,'' wouldcorrect what they believe are inadequacies in the final Reaganbudget.   ``We would hope that when the Bush administration submits its ownbudget, we will see a substantial increase,'' said Susan Frost,executive director of a coalition of education groups. ``If we wereto see ... basically no changes in the Bush administration, we'd bevery disappointed.''   Under the proposed budget, education outlays would rise slightlyfrom an estimated $20.6 billion to $21.2 billion next year.   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said the administration hopedto save some $750 million by cutting out two dozen programs,including some student loans and grants.   However, many of the programs up for elimination have survivedpast administration attempts to do away with them.</TEXT></DOC>
