Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from August 1, 1988, through August 12, 1988. The last biweeklynotice was published on August 10, 1988 (53 FR 30124). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules and Procedures Branch,Division of Rules and Records, Office of Administration and Resource Management,U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should citethe publication date and page number of this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 8:15 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, 1717 H Street, NW., Washington,DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to interveneis discussed below. By September 23, 1988, the licensee may file a request for a hearing withrespect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operatinglicense and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceedingand who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file awritten petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitionsfor leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filedby the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board,designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety andLicensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and theSecretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issuea notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, 1717 H Street, NW.,Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during thelast ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitionerpromptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to WesternUnion at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Unionoperator should be given Datagram Identification Number 3737 and the followingmessage addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, 1717 H Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the localpublic document room for the particular facility involved. <ITAG tagnum="84">Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-317 and 50-318,Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Calvert County,Maryland </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>December 1, 1986, October 5, 1987,and February 17, 1988. <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>In accordance with the requirementsof 10 CFR 73.55, the licensee submitted amendments to the Physical SecurityPlant for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant to reflect recent changesto that regulation. The proposed amendments would modify paragraph 2.C.(4)of Facility Operating License No. DPR-53 and paragraph 2.D of FacilityOperating License No. DPR-69 to require compliance with the revised Plan.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>On August 4, 1986 (51 FR 21817 and 27822), the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission amended Part 73 of its regulations, ``Physical Protection ofPlants and Materials,'' to clarify plant security requirements to affordan increased assurance of plant safety. The amended regulations requiredthat each nuclear power reactor licensee submit proposed amendments toits security plan to implement the revised provisions of 10 CFR 73.55.The licensee submitted its revised plan on December 1, 1986, October 5,1987, and February 17, 1988 to satisfy the requirements of the amendedregulations. The Commission proposes to amend the license to referencethe revised plan. In the Supplementary Materials accompanying the amended regulations, theCommission indicated that it was amending its regulations ``to providea more safety conscious safeguards system while maintaining the currentlevels of protection'' and that the ``Commission believes that the clarificationand refinement of requirements as reflected in these amendments is appropriatebecause they afford an increased assurance of plant safety.'' The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of thecriteria for determining whether a significant hazards consideration existsby providing certain examples of actions involving no significant hazardsconsiderations and examples of actions involving significant hazards considerations(51 FR 7750). One of these examples of actions involving no significanthazards considerations is example (vii) ``a change to conform a licenseto changes in the regulations, where the license change results in veryminor changes to facility operations clearly in keeping with the regulations.''The changes in this case fall within the scope of the example. For theforegoing reasons, the Commission proposes to determine that the proposedamendments involve no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Calvert County Library, PrinceFrederick Maryland. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Jay E.

Capra, Director <ITAG tagnum="84">Boston Edison Company, Docket No. 50-293, Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station,Plymouth County, Massachusetts </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>August 6, 1988. <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldchange the Technical Specifications to reflect changes in Station Organization.The proposed amendment also corrects editorial errors in the Table of Contentsand Section 6 of the Technical Specifications. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee's analysis contained in their August 6, 1988 letter (BECo88-121) states the following in response to the three NRC criteria referencedabove: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. Operation of PNPS in accordance with the proposed amendment wouldnot involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment is an administrative change to the organizationalstructure of PNPS management and technical support. The overall safetyresponsibilities and functions of the management staff are unchanged. Theadditional flexibility given the Station Director in appointing OperationsReview Committee members does not affect the overall qualifications andrange of expertise of the ORC's membership. Additional proposed changesserve to conform management titles to the current nuclear organization,ensure the proper level of management attention and increase the accountabilityof individual managers in their functional areas. Because no aspects ofthe nuclear organization that are important to safety are removed or diminished,the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Operation of PNPS in accordance with the proposed amendment wouldnot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment is administrative in nature and does not involveany change to plant design or configuration. For this reason, it will notcreate the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Operation of PNPS in accordance with the proposed amendment wouldnot involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment does not remove or diminish any elements ofthe nuclear organization that are essential to the safe operation of PNPS.It does not involve any changes to plant operating systems or associatedsafety analyses. For these reasons, the proposed amendment will not involvea significant reduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and agrees with it. Therefore,we conclude that the amendment satisfies the three criteria listed in 10CFR 50.92(c). Based on that conclusion, the staff proposes to make a ``nosignificant hazards'' determination. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Plymouth Public Library,11 North Street, Plymouth, Massachusetts 02360 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>W.S.

Wessman, PDI-3 <ITAG tagnum="84">Boston Edison Company, Docket No. 50-293, Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station,Plymouth County, Massachusetts </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>August 6, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldrevise Technical Specifications to allow some fire barriers to have ratingsof less than 3 hours. The proposed amendment is required because a recentlycompleted review of plant fire barriers determined that existing documentationwould not support verification of a three hour fire rating for some barriersreferenced in License Section 3.F. As a result, Fire Protection EngineeringEvaluations (FPEEs) were performed to determine the adequacy of the subjectfire barriers. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee's analysis contained in their August 6, 1988 letter (BECo88-120) states the following in response to the three NRC criteria referencedabove: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. Operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The level of defense a fire barrier must provide is directly tiedto the equipment it protects, the function of the protected equipment,the fire hazards it protects against, and the ability to detect and suppressthe fire. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">FPEEs document actual fire barrier configuration, fire hazards associatedwith the areas separated by the barrier, pertinent fire protection features,and the consequences of a design basis fire. The FPEE is, by instruction,reviewed and approved by a fire protection engineer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An FPEE establishes that a fire barrier provides protection consistentwith its ultimate design objective of preventing fire propagation, or documentswhy a lesser rating is acceptable. By establishing that the barrier iscapable of meeting its design function, independent of its 3 hour firerating, it is therefore established that there is not a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously identified.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Hence, the proposed change to License Condition 3.F, by sanctioningthe conclusions reached in the FPEEs, will not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously identified.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As discussed in item 1 above, the FPEE process is a formal processused to establish that a fire barrier can perform its design function.Since accident evaluations assume that selected equipment will performin a predetermined way (design functions), the establishment of a firebarrier's ability to perform its design function of protecting areas andequipment associated with accident evaluations includes it within the categoryof ``accidents previously evaluated.'' Therefore, operating Pilgrim Stationaccording to the proposed change will not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Operation of Pilgrim Station in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Failure of fire barriers poses a challenge to a margin of safety ifthe barriers cannot perform their design function; that is, they fail toprotect equipment from the debilitating effects of fire. If barriers canbe demonstrated capable of performing their design function using an acceptableand consistent methodology, the margin of safety is not reduced. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">FPEEs demonstrate that the barriers impacted by the proposed changeare capable of performing their design function. Therefore, operating PilgrimStation in accordance with the proposed change does not involve a significantreduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and agrees with it. We thereforeconclude that this amendment satisfies the three criteria of 10 CFR 50.92(c)and based on that conclusion propose to make a ``no significant hazards''determination. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Plymouth Public Library,11 North Street, Plymouth, Massachusetts 02360. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>W.S.

According to 10CFR 50.92(c), a proposed amendment to an operating license involves nosignificant hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordancewith the proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previous evaluated; or (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed amendment removes Tables 3.3-2 and 3.3-5 from the TechnicalSpecifications. These tables list the reactor trip system instrumentationresponse times and engineered safety features response times. The tableswill be placed in a new section of the Byron/Braidwood FSAR, Chapter 16.3.The response times listed in the tables are not being changed by this proposedamendment. The requirements to periodically measure the response time willremain in the Technical Specifications. Relocating the reactor trip and engineered safety features response timetables from the Technical Specifications to the FSAR is an administrativechange. The response times assumed in previously evaluated accidents arenot being changed by this proposed amendment. As a result, the probabilityor consequences of previously evaluated accidents are not affected by thisamendment. Similarly, this administrative change does not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident, nor does it affect a margin ofsafety. For the reasons stated above, the staff believes that the proposed amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>For Byron Station the RockfordPublic Library, 215 N.

According to 10CFR 50.92(c), a proposed amendment to an operating license involves nosignificant hazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordancewith the proposed amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed Technical Specification amendment requests several changes.The first change removes the existing, fixed F<T2>xy</T2> limits in Specification 4.2.2.2.e and substitutes a requirementto submit the F<T2>xy</T2> limits to the NRC in a Peaking Factor Limit Report in accordancewith Specification 6.9.1.9. The second change revises the position titleto whom the Radial Peaking Factor Limit Report is submitted per Specification6.9.1.9. The title is changed from ``Chief, Core Performance Branch'' to``Chief, Reactor Systems Branch, DPL-A'' to reflect the current organizationalresponsibilities within the NRC. This change applies only to Byron sinceit has already been incorporated in the Braidwood Technical Specifications.Finally in Specification 6.9.1.7, the references to Specifications ``3.3.3.10and 3.3.3.11'' are being changed to Specifications ``3.3.3.9 and 3.3.3.10''respectively because an incorrect specification is referenced. All the changes requested are administrative in nature and do not affectthe probability of an accident occurring. The proposed revision to Specification4.2.2.2.e does not change the current F<T2>xy</T2> limits used at the plant. It simply revises the method by whichchanges to the F<T2>xy</T2> limits can be requested and implemented. The other changescorrect a typographical error and change a position title. None of thesechanges affect the assumptions or results of any accidents previously analyzed.Therefore the consequences of any accidents are not impacted. The proposed changes do not involve any equipment additions or modificationsat the plant or cause the plant to be operated in a different manner. Therefore,the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated is not created. The Radial Peaking Factor, F<T2>xy</T2> (Z), is measured periodically to provide assurance that theHeat Flux Hot Channel Factor, F<T2>q</T2> (Z), remains within its limit. The limits on Heat Flux Hot ChannelFactor help to ensure the design limits on peak local power density andminimum DNRB are not exceeded and in the event of a LOCA, the peak fuelclad temperature will not exceed the 2200anddegrees; F acceptance criteria.The proposed change to remove the fixed limits from the Technical Specificationand replace the requirement with a submittal of a Radial Peaking FactorLimit Report does not change the F<T2>xy</T2> limits. The remaining changes are administrative in nature.The changes proposed for this amendment do not affect any margins of safety.Therefore, based upon the pervious analysis, the staff concludes that theproposed amendment to the Technical Specifications does not involve significanthazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>For the Byron Station RockfordPublic Library, 215 N.

This amendmentrequest is the same as that granted for Byron Station on July 1, 1988.That approval resulted in the issuance of Amendment 19 to NPF-37 and NPF-66on Docket Nos. 50-454 and 50-455. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether no significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from an accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee has determined, and the NRC staff agrees, that the proposedamendment will not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated because it will not involve any physicalchange in the plant or operating procedures. The proposed amendment mayhave some effect on the probability of an accident previously evaluatedsince there will be fewer people performing the independent safety assessmentfunction within the Onsite Nuclear Safety Group (ONSG). However, any increasein this probability will not be significant and will be compensated forby the activities of several new corporate level groups (created by recentcorporate organization changes) that are independent of the immediate managementchain for power production. These groups now perform independent assessmentsof operating characteristics and safety issues that are often redundantto the Technical Specification responsibilities of the ONSG. This proposedamendment does not change ONSG areas of review as described in the TechnicalSpecifications. The ONSG retains responsibility for review of those itemslisted in Technical Specification 6.2.3.1, but will make additional useof the independent review work done by the above noted corporate levelgroups. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated because there will be no change in the inthe physical plant or in the way the plant is operated. No new accidentsare postulated. As a result, operation of the plant in accordance withthe proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because therewill be no physical change in the plant or change in operation of the plant.There may be some effect on the margin of safety in terms of the amountof review of operating characteristics and safety issues, but this changewill not be significant due to the independent assessment activities ofrecently created corporate level groups.

The proposed changes effect the TSs which specifythe qualifications and conduct of the Nuclear Review Board (NRB) for allUnits and the Site Nuclear Review Board for Millstone Units 1, 2 and 3.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The licensees have proposed the following changes to the Haddam NeckTS: (1) A new TS 6.5.2.1a would specify the qualifications of the NRB Chairmanand NRB members which had previously been incorporated in TS 6.5.2.2, ``Composition'',(2) the NRB functional review areas which are in TS 6.5.2.1, ``Function,''would be designated as new TS 6.5.2.1b, (3) the minimum composition ofthe NRB, specified in TS 6.2.2, ``Composition,'' would be changed fromseven to eight members, (4) a ``charter'' for the NRB review function wouldbe added to TS 6.5.2.6, ``Review,'' to require that ``The NRB shall functionas an independent review body ...'', and (5) the minimum quorum for theNRB, given in TS 6.5.2.5, ``Quorum'' would no longer be fixed at four membersplus the chairman but would be established as ``...a majority of the membersincluding the chairman.'' In addition, the licensees have proposed the following changes to the TSfor Millstone Units 1, 2 and 3: (1) A new TS 6.5.3.1a would specify the qualifications of the NRB Chairmanand NRB members which had previously been incorporated in TS 6.5.3.2, ``Composition'',(2) the NRB functional review areas which are presently in 6.5.3.1, ``Function'',would be designated as new TS 6.5.2.1b, (3) the minimum composition ofthe NRB, specified in TS 6.5.3.2., ``Composition'', would be changed fromseven to eight members, (4) a ``charter'' for the NRB review function wouldbe added to TS 6.5.3.6, ``Review'', to require that ``The NRB shall functionas an independent review body...'', (5) the minimum quorum for the NRB,given in TS 6.5.3.5 would no longer be fixed at four members plus the chairmanbut would be established as ``... a majority of the members including thechairman'', (6) a new TS 6.5.4.1a would specify the qualifications of theSite Nuclear Review Board (SNRB) Chairman and SNRB members which had previouslybeen incorporated in TS 6.5.4.2, `Composition,'' (7) the SNRB functionalreview areas which are presently in TS 6.5.4.1, ``Function'', would bedesignated as new TS 6.5.4.1b, and (8) a ``charter'' for the SNRB wouldbe added to TS 6.5.3.6, ``Review'' to require that, ``The SNRB shall functionas an independent review body....'' The proposed changes to the TS would provide an improved level of commonalityamong the requirements for NRB for Haddam Neck and Millstone Units 1, 2and 3. In addition, the TS would not decrease the effectiveness, in termsof qualifications or operating efficiency of the NRB or SNRB. Accordingly,the safety review and audit functions of NRB/SNRB would not be changedby the proposed TS. The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). The licensee has determined and the NRC agrees that the proposed amendmentwill not: (1) Cause a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously analyzed as a result of oversight by the NRBor SNRB since the proposed TS does not reduce the effectiveness of NRBor SNRB functions; (2) create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any accident previously evaluated since no changes inplant equipment or operation are involved; and (3) reduce safety marginssince no accident analyses have been changed. Accordingly, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the proposed changesto the TSs for Haddam Neck and Millstone Units 1, 2 and 3 involve no significanthazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Russel Library, 123 BroadStreet, Middletown, Connecticut 06103 and Waterford Public Library, 49Rope Ferry Road, Waterford, Connecticut 06385. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry andamp;Howard, One Constitution Plaza, Hartford, Connecticut 06103. <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John F.

This amendment was previously noticed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 9, 1986 (51 FR 33322). However,the August 14, 1986 application originally requested a permanent changefor the surveillance interval for the RVVVs from once every 18 months toonce per fuel cycle, and also requested a change to the surveillance intervalfor the high pressure and low pressure injection pumps and valves. By AmendmentNo. 93 dated October 21, 1986, the staff approved the licensee's requestregarding the surveillance interval for the high pressure and low pressureinjection pumps and valves. In addition, on November 7, 1986, the staffissued Amendment No. 94 which extended the surveillance interval for theRVVVs from once per 18 months to once per fuel cycle for Cycle 6 only,and stated that the requested permanent extension of the surveillance intervalwould be addressed as a separate action. Subsequently, by letter dated August 2, 1988, the licensee revised theiroriginal application and requested that the surveillance requirements bechanged from ``at least once per 18 months during shutdown'' to ``at leastonce per 24 months during shutdown.'' Due to this revised submittal, thestaff has decided to renotice the proposed amendment. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the proposed change in accordance with the requirementsof 10 CFR 50.92 and has determined that the proposed change does not involvesignificant hazard considerations. The past operating experience of theRVVVs in the industry and at Crystal River 3 has shown that they will remainoperable for periods far greater than 18 months; therefore, the proposedchange will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The proposed change will not createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated since there is no new mode of plant operation beingintroduced nor does the proposed change involve a physical modificationto the plant. Finally, the proposed change will not involve a significantreduction in a margin of safety since existing reactor coolant system chemistrycontrols and valve material will help to ensure that corrosion is insignificantand therefore help maintain the existing reliability of the RVVVs. The staff has performed a preliminary review of the licensee's evaluationand agrees with the conclusion that the proposed change does not involvesignificant hazards considerations. Therefore, the staff proposes to determinethat the requested amendment does not involve significant hazards considerations.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Crystal River Public Library,668 NW., First Avenue, Crystal River, Florida 32629 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>R.

The firstchange involves the deletion of Figures 6.2.1-1 and 6.2.2-1 showing theoffsite and onsite organizations and replacing them with more general requirementswhich capture the essential aspects of the organizational structure. TSSections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 would be supplemented to include these more generalorganizational requirements in accordance with Generic Letter 88-06 datedMarch 22, 1988. The second change would replace the reference to the Vice President-Nuclear,contained in TS 6.1.2, with a more generic title, senior corporate nuclearofficer. For consistency, TS 6.5.1.6f, 6.5.1.6m, 6.5.1.8b, 6.5.1.9, 6.5.2.4.3g,6.5.2.4.4b, 6.5.2.6, 6.6.1b, 6.7.1a, and 6.7.1c would also replace thetitle, Vice President-Nuclear, with the title, senior corporate nuclearofficer. This change is necessary because the title, Vice President-Nuclear,has been changed to Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer and the TSas currently structured, should reflect this change. However, this amendmentrequest proposes to replace the specific title, Vice President-Nuclear,with a more generic title, senior corporate nuclear officer. This changewill alleviate the need to process future amendment requests to reflecttitle changes for the Vice President and Chief Nuclear Officer. The third and final change affects TS 6.9.2 and 6.9.3 concerning specialreports. It would require that special reports be submitted to the USNRCDocument Control Desk with a copy to the Regional Administrator.

The PublicService Electric and Gas Company reviewed the proposed change and determinedand the NRC staff agrees that the proposed amendment does not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. The hydrogen analyzers provide containmenthydrogen concentration indication to control room operators under accidentconditions. The operation or failure of this systems does not lessen anysafety systems' ability to perform its design function. These changes areconsistent with the guidance provided in Generic Letter 83-37. (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany previously analyzed. The hydrogen analyzers provide indication only.Their failure to operate cannot create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident. (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The hydrogenanalyzers, while being required by Technical Specifications, do not havean active part in the determination of a margin of safety. They only providecontrol room indication of containment hydrogen concentrations during accidentconditions. The added Action Statement and increased Surveillance Requirementsare consistent with the guidance given in Generic Letter 83-37. Furthermore, the increase in the surveillance requirements confirms theoperability of the hydrogen analyzers at more frequent intervals. Thisprovides earlier and more frequent indication to plant operators of thestatus of the system, thus increasing the probability that it will functionas required. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that this change doesnot involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Salem Free Public library,112 West Broadway, Salem, New Jersey 08079 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mark J.

By letter dated November 9, 1987, the NRC requested additional informationon the proposed changes. The licensee responded with a submittal datedMay 16, 1988. The May 16, 1988 submittal: (1) adds the following statement to Action Statement b.1 of TS 3.8.1.1,``If the EDG became inoperable due to any cause other than preplanned maintenance....''(2) adds a footnote to Action Statements b.2 and c.2 of TS 3.8.1.1, whichrequires the test to be completed regardless of when the inoperable EDGis restored. (3) retains the original frequency of every 18 months in Surveillance Requirements4.8.1.1.1.b and 4.8.1.1.2.e. (4) changes the loading band to 4150-4250 kW. (5) retains the wording of ``concurrent with'' in TS 4.8.1.1.2.e.6.c. (6) requires the two hour loading at the short time rating at the beginningof the test in accordance with position C.14 of Regulatory Guide 1.9. (7)retains the original reporting requirements in TS 4.8.1.1.3. The July 14, 1988 supplement transmitted the No Significant Hazards Determinationwhich was missing from the May 16, 1988 supplement. The July 28, 1988 supplementmodified the May 16, 1988 submittal such that surveillance requirement4.8.1.1.2.a.3 of the May 16 submittal was divided into two separate surveillancerequirements, 4.8.1.1.2.a.3 and 4.8.1.1.2.a.4.

Table 3.5-1 is amended to address minimum service requirements priorto startup from a cold shutdown condition, to allow a reduction by oneof the number of RHRSW pumps required to be operable when the decay heatload can be handled by one RHR heat exchanger during shut down, and toreformat. 3. The Bases for Section 3.5.C is amended to state that the entire shutdowncooling load is capable of being handled by one RHR heat exchanger afterdecay heat levels have decreased following shutdown. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided Standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.In regard to the proposed amendment, the licensee has determined the following:(1) The proposed change does not significantly increase the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Reducing the numberof RHRSW pumps as proposed will not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. A GeneralElectric study performed for Browns Ferry has shown that 96 hours followingreactor shutdown, the decay heat load is approximately 12.5 MWt. One RHRheat exchanger can supply adequate cooling capacity during this shutdownmode. Based on this analysis, the minimum RHRSW pump requirements havebeen reduced. The proposed TS will require only two RHRSW pumps to be operablefor each unit that has been in cold shutdown for more than 96 hours. Theproposed change will not affect the reliability of the RHRSW system. TheRHRSW system will still be able to perform its intended safety functionand therefore does not create a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. (2) The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident than any accident previously evaluated. The General Electricanalysis has shown that one RHR heat exchanger, and thus, one RHRSW pump,can supply adequate cooling capability after the unit has been shut downfor 96 hours. The proposed change does not alter the operation or functionof the RHRSW system and therefore will not create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. (3) The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in marginof safety. It does not change or alter the required safety functions ofthe RHRSW system, nor does it physically modify any equipment, setpoints,or initiating time/sequence of the equipment. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's determination and concurs withits finding. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that theapplication for amendments involves no significant hazards considerations.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Athens Public Library, SouthStreet, Athens, Alabama 35611. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>General Counsel, Tennessee Valley Authority,400 West Summit Hill Drive, E11 B33, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902. <T3>NRC Assistant Director: </T3>Suzanne Black <ITAG tagnum="84">Tennessee Valley Authority, Docket No. 50-260, Browns Ferry NuclearPlant, Unit 2, Limestone County, Alabama </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>July 29, 1988 (TS 248) <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldmodify the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, Unit 2 Technical Specificationsby changing the trip setpoint for the Automatic Depressurization System(ADS) timers from 120 andplusmin;5 seconds to 105 andplusmin;7 seconds, correctingminor TS discrepancies, and adding the surveillance and setpoint requirementsfor the new 12\1/2\ minute timers being added in accordance with NUREG-0737,Item II.K.3.18, to bypass the high drywell pressure requirement for ADSinitiation. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided Standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). 10 CFR 50.91requires that at the time a licensee requests an amendment, it must provideto the Commission its analyses, using the standards in Section 50.92, onthe issue of no significant hazards consideration. Therefore, in accordancewith 10 CFR 50.91 and 10 CFR 50.92, the licensee has performed and providedthe following analysis: <ITAG tagnum="21">NRC has provided standards for determining whether a significant hazardsconsideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from an accident previously evaluated, or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluatedbecause: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) None of the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) accidents areinitiated by spurious actuation or failure of the ADS initiation logiccircuitry. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The ADS will still function and operate as currently designed,the 120andCx.207;andplusmin;5 second setpoint for the existing timer is longenough to allow the operator sufficient time to abort an ADS blowdown ifconditions warrant, (e.g., if high pressure makeup systems are adequatelyrestoring Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) water level). Thus, lowering thesetpoint of the existing ADS timer to 105 andplusmin;7 seconds does not significantlyincrease the probability of creating the large stresses associated witha rapid blowdown event on the RPV. These large stresses caused by a rapidblowdown, however, were included in the design of the reactor vessel, andthese stresses will not be increased by the proposed changes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) With this modification, two means (manually by operator and automaticallyby new ADS circuitry) would be available to mitigate a Loss of CoolantAccident event. Therefore, the consequences of this accident scenario arereduced. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Themodification to decrease the setpoint ensures that the ADS reacts to anaccident condition within the time analyzed in the FSAR. The addition ofa timer to bypass the high-drywell pressure interlock causes the ADS toinitiate for accidents which previously required manual initiation anddecreases the probability for operator error. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reductionin the margin of safety. The time required for high pressure reactor vesselmakeup systems to react to a loss-of-coolant accident is reduced (i.e.,120-second timer setpoint changed to 105-second setpoint), but it is stilllong enough to ensure that short term transient conditons will not unnecessarilyinitiate the ADS. Also, by adding circuitry to automatically initiate ADSfor accidents previously requiring manual initiation, it decreases thechance for operator error. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

This change is to revise the containmentsystems surveillance requirement 4.6.5.1.b.3. This change will replacethe visual inspection requirement utilizing the current 0.38-inch criteriawith a surveillance program to ensure that the flow blockage does not exceed15 percent. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>In its application, TVA provided the following discussion on its proposedchange: <ITAG tagnum="21">During preparation for unit 2 restart, the surveillance requirement(SR) of the SQN ice condenser, TS 3/4.6.5, was reviewed. The review revealedthat SR 4.6.5.1.b.3 attempted to quantify the amount of allowable ice buildupin the ice condenser flow passages, but did not adequately reflect theintent of the TS. The TS is to ensure that adequate flow area exists inthe ice condenser bays to allow passage of steam and air. The findingsalso showed that the surveillance of the ice condenser flow paths shouldbe focused on the original intent of the TS and that a reasonable methodof inspection be provided. The proposed method of inspection is more feasibleand provides a more direct relationship to the functional requirementsof the ice condenser. </ITAG>The Commission has provided Standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). 10 CFR 50.91requires that at the time a licensee requests an amendment, it must provideto the Commission its analyses, using the standards in Section 50.92, onthe issue of no significant hazards consideration. Therefore, in accordancewith 10 CFR 50.91 and 10 CFR 50.92, the licensee has performed and providedthe following analysis: <ITAG tagnum="21">TVA has evaluated the proposed TS change and determined that it doesnot represent a significant hazards consideration based on criteria establishedin 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of SQN in accordance with the proposed amendmentwill not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The ice condenser system is a passivesystem designed to absorb thermal energy released immediately followinga LOCA [Loss-of-Coolant Accident] or a high energy line break (HELB) forthe purpose of limiting peak pressure inside containment. The ice condenserserves no function during normal operation but is required in mitigatingthe consequences of a LOCA or HELB. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Existing TS SR 4.6.5.1.b.3 requires verification that the accumulationof frost or ice on flow passages is restricted to a thickness of less thanor equal to 0.38 inch. The intent of this SR was to ensure that the flowareas in the ice condenser are consistent with those used by Westinghousein analyses to determine containment design pressure. Frost of ice accumulationin the flow passages could momentarily add resistance to the flow of airand steam through the ice condenser. The Westinghouse analyses assumesa hypothetical LOCA and utilized the TMD computer code. The TMD computercode was used for a short-term subcompartment pressure analysis that determinedshort duration pressure transients across interior concrete walls, theoperating deck slab, and the containment shell during the blowdown period.The mass and energy releases used in these analyses were increased by 10percent over those calculated by the SATAN computer code, and no structuralheat sinks were modeled to provide additional conservatism in the calculationof the pressure rise. Westinghouse performed sensitivity studies of flowblockages in the ice condenser, which established that the containmentpressure was less than 12 psig with an effective blockage of 15 percentof the total available flow area in the ice bed. Additional conservatismin the sensitivity studies was that the blockages were assumed to be constantthroughout the entire height of the ice bed and neglects the benefits thatcross-flow will provide in venting the steam and air around actual blockagein the ice bed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Additionally, TVA performed calculations to confirm that the operatingdeck floor slab, refueling canal wall, crane wall above the ice condensercolumns, and ice condenser end walls were structurally adequate to withstanda design basis accident pressure increase because of ice condenser blockageup to 15 percent. These calculations confirmed that each area is structurallyadequate for operation at the increased pressures. The use of 0.38-inchmaximum ice buildup in the SQN TS for determination of blockage was intendedto quantify the amount of allowable ice buildup in the flow passages becauseaccumulation could momentarily add resistance to the flow of air and steamthrough the ice bed. Implementation of the existing SR is extremely difficult.In some instances, inspectors must visually determine whether ice buildupis less than or equal to 0.38 inch from a distance of up to 24 feet. Therevision of SRs will replace the specific 0.38-inch value for ice condenserflow passage inspection with a conservative, quantifiable, and reasonablemethod for verifying operability with respect to available flow area. Thenew surveillance method will inspect 54 (33 percent) of the flow passagesin each of the 24 ice condenser bays against acceptance criteria whereany bay with less than or equal to 15-percent calculated blockage shallbe considered to have acceptable flow channels for passages of air andsteam through the ice condenser. Westinghouse has determined through sensitivitystudies that up to 15-percent blockage will allow adequate flow throughthe ice condenser. The surveillance method to be used for flow passageinspection uses an acceptance criteria based on 15-percent blockage; therevision of the TS to replace the specific 0.38-inch value will not adverselyaffect the function of the ice condenser and will not increase the probabilityor consequences of any accident or malfunction previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously analyzed. The ice condenser is a passive system thatfunctions to limit initial pressure inside containment following a LOCAor HELB as previously analyzed. Westinghouse verified that 85-percent availableflow area is adequate for the ice condenser to perform its intended safetyfunction; the change in SR from requiring visual inspection to verify thatfrost/ice accumulation does not exceed 0.38 inch to visual inspection toverify that blockage does not exceed 15 percent of the total flow areawill not affect the function of the ice condenser or create abnormal operatingconditions. The new SR will provide a reliable and quantifiable means forconservative verification of blockage. Therefore, the change in SR doesnot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. R 4.6.5.1.b.3utilized a specific value of 0.38 inch for determination of frost/ice blockagein the ice condenser. This specific value was used in an attempt to quantifythe amount of blockage so that available flow area could be calculatedand verified as acceptable. This specific value, however, does not establishthe safety limit for blockage of ice condenser flow area. Westinghousehas shown that with 85 percent of total flow area. Westinghouse has shownthat with 85 percent of total flow are available, the ice condenser willperform its intended function. Therefore, the safety limit for ice condenseroperability is less than or equal to 15-percent blockage. The new surveillancemethod to be used requires more extensive visual inspection than the surveillanceprogram currently desrcibed in 4.6.1.b.3, thus providing greater reliabilityand a direct relationship to analytical safety limits. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because the safety limit for the ice condenser flow is less than orequal to 15-percent blockage of total flow are, a change in TSs to implementa surveillance program that is more reliable utilizing a 15-percent blockageacceptance criteria will not reduce the margin of safety. Design limitsfor the continued safe function of the containment shell and concrete containmentwalls and slabs are not exceeded as a result of this change. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has provided the following analysis of no significant hazardsconsiderations using the Commission's standards. <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed change to allow the plant to remain in Mode 3 witha reduction in RCS pressure in lieu of going to Mode 4 if accumulator operabilitycannot be restored would not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The change to the Action Statementis merely to allow the plant to remain in Hot Standby (Mode 3) for a longerperiod of time after an accumulator has been declared inoperable, in lieuof going to Hot Shutdown (Mode 4). This additional time allowance in Mode3 at a reduction of the RCS pressure to less than 1000 psig would reducethermal cycling on the RCS and reactor internals; conform with the currentversion of the Westinghouse Standard Technical Specifications, NUREG-0452,Rev. 5; and would not affect the scope of the technical specifications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated. There is no change to the system orcomponents to create any new failure or accident sequences. The changeallows the plant to remain in Mode 3 for a longer time period upon entryinto an Action Statement and is consistent with NUREG-0452, Rev. 5. Thischange also does not affect the scope or intent of the original technicalspecification Action Statement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The changeto allow the plant to remain in Mode 3 at a reduced RCS pressure does notimpact the margin of safety. Since this change is only effective upon entryinto an Action Statement due to an inoperable accumulator, the margin ofsafety has been already reduced to three out of four accumulators availableif needed and, therefore, this changes does not impact the margin of safetythat currently exists. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The second proposed change would allow an accumulator isolationvalve to be closed for a specified period of up to 2 hours, with the reactorin Mode 3 and with RCS pressure greater than 1000 psig, for testing ofsystem check valves. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The change would not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changewould allow a time period of up to 2 hours in which an accumulator isolationvalve can be closed while the plant is in Mode 3 and RCS pressure is greaterthan 1000 psig to perform surveillance leakage testing of system checkvalves. This 2-hour time period would only be applicable in Mode 3 andwould not affect accident evaluations since the current Action Statementallows up to 6 hours to achieve Mode 3 status with an accumulator isolationvalve closed. Also the valve could be immediately opened if needed sincethe accumulator otherwise meets operability requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The change would not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. There is no changeto the system or components to create any new failure or accident sequences.The change is merely a closely monitored period of time in which an accumulatorisolation valve is closed on an otherwise operable accumulator to allowfor system check valve testing required by technical specifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The change would not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. While the shutdown margin following a LOCA may be reduced ifa LOCA were to occur with one accumulator isolated, the increase in allowedtime before the accumulator isolation valve could be opened does not significantlyaffect the margin of safety since the accumulator could be returned toservice if needed. </ITAG>Based on the previous discussions, the licensee concluded that the proposedamendment request does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; does not create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; does not involve a reduction in the required margin of safety.The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

In addition, the definitionof containment integrity would be revised to clarify the actions to betaken for an inoperable automatic containment isolation valve. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the proposed change with regard to the personnelairlock door in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.92 and hasdetermined that the proposed change does not involve significant hazardsconsiderations. The change would not increase the probability of occurrenceof a design basis accident. And, although there may be an effect on theconsequences of an accident if there is a pressurization (Design Base Accident)of the containment during the time the outer door is opened and leakagethrough the inner door exists, the licensee has determined that the potentialincrease in the consequences of an event is considered to be insignificantfor the following reasons: a. Entry through the personnel airlock during subatmospheric conditionsis acceptable based on the current limiting conditions for operation providedthat at least one airlock door is closed and properly sealed. As such,the required containment integrity condition necessary for limiting theconsequences of an accident can be satisfied by a single door. b. The amount of leakage through the inner door seal may not meet the acceptancecriteria of the surveillance test. If the seal cannot be repaired and retestedat this time, the outer door would be closed and sealed. If the inner doorseal leakage is excessive, the pressure equalization necessary to openthe outer door could not be accomplished and repairs could not be madeuntil the unit is in a cold shutdown condition with the containment pressurereturned to atmospheric. c. In the event of a containment pressurization due to a design basis accidentduring the entry through the outer door, the increased pressure in thecontainment would more fully seat the inner door and would tend to reducethe seal leakage. d. The probability of a design basis accident occurring during the briefperiod of time that the outer door is opened for access to repair the innerdoor seal is considered to be insignificant. Although the consequences of the accident may increase slightly, the probabilityof the event is sufficiently small so that the overall increase in consequencesis considered insignificant. In addition, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any evaluated previously. Although aquantitative analysis of releases has not been made, the potential foran accident concurrent with repair activities and hence the potential consequencesare considered to be insignificant. Finally, the proposed change would not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. Although the redundancy in the design of the personnelairlock door and the capability to limit the leakage through the airlockdoor may be reduced during this brief evolution, the reduction of marginis considered insignificant based on the small probability of concurrentlyopening the outer door and having a design basis event. In addition, theeffort expended to repair the inner door seal and ensure the operabilityof both personnel airlock seals improves the capability of the airlockto withstand a containment pressurization and restore the redundancy inthe design of the personnel airlock. Repair of the airlock door seals isconsidered prudent and is normally performed even though the TechnicalSpecifications (1.H.4) for the Surry units requires only one door sealto be operable. With regard to the proposed change concerning the inoperable automaticcontainment isolation valve, the licensee has reviewed the proposed changein accordance with 10 CFR 50.92 and determined that the proposed amendmentswill not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. [The] amendment[s] [do] not alter therequirement to ensure that inoperable containment isolation valves areclosed (post accident required position). It clarifies the actions necessary to ensure that valves with air operated(solenoid valves) actuators or direct acting solenoid valves are properlysecured. Specific actions for deactivating and securing inoperable valvesare provided in the Surry Administrative Procedure (SUADM-0-26). 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyevaluated previously in the safety analysis report. The requirement toclose inoperable containment isolation valves is preserved but clarifiedfor particular types of valves. 3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The marginof safety will not be affected since the inoperable valves will be closed.After a preliminary review of the licensee's analyses concerning the proposedchanges, the staff agrees with the licensee's conclusions.

The proposed modification regarding a revision of the nuclear enthalpyrise hot channel factor part power multiplier from 0.2 to 0.3 (Change 1)and the modifications to the over temperature delta-T, over power delta-T,and reactor coolant flow setpoints (Change 2) do not involve a significanthazards consideration. (1) The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changesaffect reactor core design parameters associated with accident mitigationor operational transients. These parameters are determined by design toprotect the reactor core from exceeding safety limits. These changes donot affect initiators of an event that would change the probability ofoccurrence of an accident previously evaluated. The consequences of previouslyevaluated accidents have not been increased. The impact of these changeson the safety analyses has been evaluated. The evaluation results indicatethat the safety analyses continue to meet required safety limits. (2) The proposed changes affect reactor core design parameters associatedwith mitigation of postulated accidents and transients. No design changesto plant structures, systems or equipment or modifications to plant operationare being proposed. There are no new failure modes or mechanisms associatedwith the proposed revisions. The changes reflect revised parameters basedon evaluations of existing analyses and or reanalysis, as necessary. Theproposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any previously evaluated. (3) The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. The changes do not affect any Technical Specification marginof safety. The changes proposed impact the analyses assumptions and inputsused in the safety analyses, the core power limits used in the reactordesign, and reactor trip setpoints. The affected safety analyses and corepower limits have been evaluated and/or reanalyzed as necessary and ithas been determined that all applicable safety cirteria are met. Therefore,the margin of safety as defined in the bases has not been reduced. AffectedTechnical Specifications have been revised to reflect the proposed changes.The proposed change to Special Text Exception 3.10.4 (Change 3) does notinvolve a significant hazards consideration. The NRC has given guidance concerning the applicability of 10 CFR 50.92by providing examples (50 FR 7751) for comparison. The proposed TechnicalSpecification modifications to eliminate an inconsistent reference to SpecialTest Exception 3.10.4 are purely administrative and are encompassed byexample (i) of actions not likely to involve a significant hazards consideration.The proposed modification regarding the boron concentration limits forthe RWST and the Safety Injection System accumulators (Changes 4, 5, 6,and 7) do not involve a significant hazards consideration. (1) The proposed Technical Specification modifications involve changesin boron concentrations in systems used to mitigate plant accidents andtransients. The consequences of accidents and transients previously evaluatedin the USAR, including LOCA and non-LOCA events, have been evaluated and/orreanalyzed and are not significantly affected by the proposed changes.Therefore, the proposed changes would not involve an increase in the probabilityof occurrence of an accident previously evaluated. (2) The proposed Technical Specification changes would revise boron concentrationsin systems used to mitigate plant accidents and transients. No modificationsto plant design or operational requirement to switch to hot leg recirculation12 hours following a LOCA. However, the 12 hours would allow sufficienttime for the required operator action and, therefore, the possibility ofboron precipitation on fuel rods following a LOCA is not significantlyaffected. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentwould not be created by the proposed changes. (3) The proposed revisions in boron concentrations affect safety analysisinputs and assumptions. The affected safety analyses have been evaluated,and it has been determined that all applicable safety criteria are metwith no significant adverse affects on analyses results. Therefore, themargin of safety as defined by the USAR, safety analyses, and the TechnicalSpecification Bases would not be significantly reduced. Based on the above discussions, it has been determined that the requestedTechnical Specification revisions do not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident or other adverse conditionover previous evaluations; or create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident over previous evaluations; or involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. Therefore, the requested changes do not involvea significant hazards consideration.

The Commission has determined foreach of these amendments that the application for the amendment complieswith the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, asamended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commissionhas made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission'srules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the licenseamendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the datethe amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish,for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Considerationof Issuance of Amendment and Proposed No Significant Hazards ConsiderationDetermination and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances,the Commission has either issued a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice providing opportunity for public commentor has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surroundinga licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission'sproposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commissionhas provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, usingits best efforts to make available to the public means of communicationfor the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments,the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licenseehas been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted,for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in preventionof either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up tothe plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunityto provide for public comment on its no significant hazards determination.In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunityfor comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment.If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, theState has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediatelyeffective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearingfrom any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any requiredhearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards considerationis involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made afinal determination that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documentsrelated to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued andmade effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendmentssatisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impactstatement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments.If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the specialcircumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determinationbased on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3)the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or EnvironmentalAssessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 1717 H Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to theU. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director,Division of Reactor Projects. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respectto the issuance of the amendments. By September 23, 1988, the licenseemay file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendmentto the subject facility operating license and any person whose interestmay be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a partyin the proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene.Requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filedin accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic LicensingProceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petitionfor leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or anAtomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by theChairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on therequest and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceedingand how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested,it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held wouldtake place while the amendment is in effect. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, 1717 H Street, NW.,Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during thelast ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitionerpromptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to WesternUnion at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Unionoperator should be given Datagram Identification Number 3737 and the followingmessage addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or theAtomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or request shouldbe granted based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v)and 2.714(d). <ITAG tagnum="84">Nebraska Public Power District, Docket No. 50-298, Cooper NuclearStation, Nemaha County, Nebraska </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>July 5, 1988 <T3>Brief description of amendment: </T3>The amendment changed the TechnicalSpecifications to delete the requirement to partially stroke the Main SteamlineIsolation Valves (MSIVs) weekly. <T3>Date of issuance: </T3>August 8, 1988 <T3>Effective date: </T3> August 8, 1988 <T3>Amendment No.: </T3>125 <T3>Facility Operating License No. DPR-46. </T3>Amendment revised the TechnicalSpecifications. <T3>Public comments requested as to proposed no significant hazards consideration:</T3>Yes (53 FR 26696 dated July 14, 1988).
