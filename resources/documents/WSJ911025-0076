According to International Chetek Corp., the intense heatof an underground nuclear blast would vaporize toxic wastesinstantly and lock the radioactive residue under globs ofmolten rock. The process could save companies some billiondollars a year, according to Alexander Chernyshev, a Chetekofficial and physicist who formerly designed Soviet warheads.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. officials say Mr. Chernyshev's company is formed froma group of scientists formally employed by Arzamas-16, thesecretive, Soviet equivalent of the U.S. nuclear weaponsdesign laboratory at Los Alamos, N.M. Its salesmen firstproposed the idea to a symposium of environmentalists andscientists meeting in Ottawa last spring.   The theory caused a minor explosion among the attendees,most of whom were environmentalists concerned about theecological hazards of nuclear testing in the Arctic.&quot;Frankly, everyone in the room thought {the Chetek officials}were crazy,&quot; recalls John Lamb, executive director of theCanadian Centre for Arms Control and Disarmament.   Dr. Chernyshev told the environmentalists that the Sovietsmay sponsor a nuclear blast next year to destroy somechemical weapons at the Novaya Zemlya test site in theArctic. Later, they might export the technology so othercountries could destroy their wastes at designated sites, hesaid.   U.S. government scientists consider the idea technicallyfeasible, but have rejected the idea because &quot;it has someobvious environmental and political drawbacks,&quot; according toa government official who requested anonymity.   He said Soviet officials have proposed the idea of usingnuclear explosives to destroy chemical weapons during severalrecent negotiations.   Chetek claims to have been licensed by the Soviet DefenseMinistry to sell technologies that were previously consideredmilitarily sensitive. Chetek, U.S. scientists say, maintainsa resort hotel for potential customers outside of Moscow.   A diplomat at the Soviet Embassy here, who also asked notto be identified, said he was unaware of Chetek. &quot;Right nowwe have hundreds of these private companies,&quot; he explained.   Mr. Lamb of the Canadian Centre and a number of U.S.scientists who have visited Chetek's office near Moscow's RedSquare say the company is a serious venture.   &quot;Chetek may be a post-Communism success story,&quot; saysWilliam C. Potter, director of the Center for Russian andSoviet Studies in Monterey, Calif. Mr. Potter attended aSoviet seminar on nuclear nonproliferation in Moscow earlierthis month. He said scientists there were buzzing with rumorsabout Chetek, which is said to have enough cash to hireweapons scientists away from government laboratories. Thescientists, he says, suspected the company's money comes fromformer Communist Party officials.   Chetek officials couldn't be reached for comment about theventure.   Thomas B. Cochran, a physicist with the Natural ResourcesDefense Council, a U.S. environmental group, says he met withChetek officials recently in Moscow. They tried to persuadehim that nuclear explosions in underground tunnels may be thebest way to destroy chemical wastes.   &quot;There are other technologies that are, I think,preferable, but {that} they would argue {are} not as cheap,&quot;said Mr. Cochran. He said the process would create a mountainof radioactive debris.   Mr. Cochran and other U.S. scientists worry that Chetek'sprocess could give the Soviets a commercial incentive to keeptesting nuclear weapons. &quot;I think it's kind of awful if theyget any takers,&quot; says Theodore Taylor, a former U.S. nuclearweapons designer. &quot;That would do all kinds of awful things tothe proposed comprehensive test ban treaty.&quot;   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, in his most recentarms-control statement, vowed that his country will stopnuclear testing. The U.S. abandoned peaceful uses for atomicexplosions in the 1960s, but continues to test nuclearweapons.   Chetek already has some fences to mend withenvironmentalists. Mr. Lamb said he visited the company thismonth to complain about an advertising flier in which Cheteksuggested the environmental forum supported its methods. &quot;Ibasically told them that they should bloody well pull thisflier because it's factually wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;They said yes,they would do that.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
