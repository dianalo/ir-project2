L. 94-163), 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy ConservationPolicy Act (NECPA), (Pub. L. 95-619), 92 Stat. 3266, the National ApplianceEnergy Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA), (Pub. L. 100-12), and the NationalAppliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA 1988), (Pub. L.100-357).\1\<NOTE/> The Act requires DOE to prescribe standardized test proceduresto measure the energy consumption of certain consumer products, includingcentral air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps. The intentof the test procedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumptionthat will assist consumers in making purchasing decisions. These test proceduresappear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart B.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Part B of Title III of EPCA, as amended, is referred toin this notice as the ``Act.'' Part B of Title III is codified at 42 U.S.C.6291 et seq.DOE has amended the prescribed test procedures on September 26, 1980, byadding 10 CFR 430.27 creating the waiver process. 45 FR 64108. DOE furtheramended the Department's appliance test procedure waiver process to allowthe Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy to grantan interim waiver from test procedure requirements to manufacturers thathave petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures. 51FR 42823, November 26, 1986. The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretaryfor Conservation and Renewable Energy to waive temporarily test proceduresfor a particular basic model when a petitioner shows that the basic modelcontains one or more design characteristics which prevent testing accordingto the prescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test proceduresmay evaluate the basic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its trueenergy consumption as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data.Waivers generally remain in effect until final test procedure amendmentsbecome effective, resolving the problem that is the subject of a waiver.The interim waiver provisions, added by the 1986 amendment, allow the AssistantSecretary to grant an interim waiver when it is determined that the applicantwill experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiveris denied, if it appears likely that the petition for waiver will be grantedand/or the Assistant Secretary determines that it would be desirable forpublic policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determinationon the petition for waiver.Carrier seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions for central air conditionersand central air conditioning heat pumps for its HydroTech 2000 model heatpump. Carrier requests this relief because, in addition to providing spaceheating and cooling, the HydroTech 2000 also provides domestic water heating.Carrier claims that while the HydroTech 2000 is capable of being testedin accordance with the DOE central air conditioner test procedure for SeasonalEnergy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) and Heating Seasonal Performance Factor(HSPF), the test procedure does not give a true representation of the enrgyconsumption of the HydroTech 2000 heat pump. The HydroTech 2000 heat pumpprovides domestic water heating during the space cooling mode with theheat rejected from the house. The excess heating capacity of the heat pumpprovides supplementary water heating during the space heating mode. Whenspace conditioning is not required, the unit operates in a water heatingonly mode. This results in reduced energy consumption for water heating,as compared to a standard two-element electric resistance water heater.Carrier requests that the water heating energy savings, compared to a conventionalwater heater, should be applied to the HydroTech 2000's space cooling andheating performance. Carrier requests the allowance to test and rate theHydroTech 2000 with an equivalent SEER and an equivalent HSPF. The testprocedure proposed by Carrier is based on the Department's test procedurefor central air conditioning heat pumps and would credit the unit's SEERand HSPF with the reduced energy use for water heating.Carrier also request an Interim Waiver from the central air conditionertest procedure for the HydroTech 2000 heat pump. Carrier, in the Applicationfor Interim Waiver, states that its Petition for Waiver will likely begranted since it includes a feature, water heating, that is not includedin the existing central air conditioner and central air conditioning heatpump test procedure. Furthermore, Carrier claims that it is in the nationalinterest for a waiver to be granted, since without a waiver, Carrier willnot be able to claim the electric energy savings capabilities of the HydroTech2000, and as a result, will lose sales which, in turn, will result in increasednational energy consumption and the corresponding release of greenhousegases. Finally, Carrier claims that it will experience economic hardshipif the Application is denied since, Carrier estimates, it will lose approximately$7 million in gross margin in the next three years.DOE has reviewed Carrier's Petition for Waiver and agrees that the extanttest procedures for central air conditioners and central air conditioningheat pumps evalutes the Carrier HydoTech 2000 heat pump in a manner unrepresentativeof its true energy consumption since it does not consider the energy usagedue to water heating. However, the Department believes that the remedyproposed by Carrier, adjusted SEER and HSPF, are also not representativeof the unit's true energy efficiency. SEER, HSPF, and Energy Factor (EF)are measures of efficiency that result from ratios of energy outputs andinputs for well-defined and separate space cooling, space heating and domesticwater heating processes. If it were possible to allocate the input energyseparately to the space heating, space cooling and domestic water heatingfunctions, then EF, SEER and HSPF could be calculated for this unit. However,DOE believes this is not possible when two processes occur simultaneously.Therefore, DOE believes that to subtract an energy savings quantity forwater heating from the denominator of an output/input ratio that appliesto space heating or cooling artificially inflates SEER and AFUE and wouldnot represent the efficiency of the HydroTech 2000 in either mode.If, based on the evidence included in Carrier's Appliance for Interim Waiver,DOE were to grant Carrier relief from the central air conditioner testprocedure, it would be to waive the test procedure entirely. Doe believesthat this is contrary to Carrier's intent since Carrier requested the waiverin order to make SEER and HSPF representations. Carrier claims that notbeing able to make representations of equivalent SEER and equivalent HSPFmakes it difficult for consumers to ``have a clear understanding of thisproduct's energy-saving capability.'' Similarly, DOE believes that grantingoutright relief from the test procedure would cause further hardships forCarrier since it would be unable to make either SEER or HSPF representations.Therefore, based on the above, Carrier's Application for an Interim Waiveris denied. This is not a determination, however, on Carrier's Petitionfor Waiver, which is being published today for comment.Carrier proposes a test method based on, to a significant extent, the existingcentral air conditioning and central air conditioning heat pump test procedures.For water heating, Carrier proposes two simulated use tests with an outdoortemperature of 17anddegrees;F and 67anddegrees;F with four water draws to simulatehousehold water usage. For combined space cooling/domestic water heating,Carrier proposes two tests, 67anddegrees;F at low compressor speed and 95anddegrees;Fat high compressor speed. For combined space heating/domestic water heating,Carrier proposes that one cyclic test and one steady-state test be performedat 17anddegrees;F. These tests are presented in detail in Carrier's Petitionfor Waiver and its proposed alternate test procedure.Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the``Petition for Waiver.'' Due to its length, Carrier's proposed alternatetest procedure (of 28 pages) (Attachment A), is not being published inthe <T4>Federal Register.</T4> It is, however, available upon request at theaddress provided at the beginning of today's notice. DOE solicits comments,data, and information respecting the petition.In addition, pursuant to paragraph (e) of andSection; 430.27 of the Codeof Federal Regulations, the following letter denying the Application forInterim Waiver was issued to Carrier Corporation.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, July 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John R.

Test Procedures for Central AirConditioners (Including Heat Pumps) as They Apply to the Carrier HydroTech2000 Series Heat Pumps</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Carrier's new HydroTech 2000 heat pump is an innovative unit thathas a unique ability to enhance residential energy conservation. The unitis the product of six years of research and development by Carrier andthe Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). The unit was developed anddesigned with one principal objective: significant energy conservation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Our objective in this petition for waiver is to seek a modificationto the procedure for testing central air conditioners (including heat pumps).Because this product is a heat pump that provides domestic water heatingin addition to space heating and cooling, a new and different procedureis required to rate this product accurately and in terms the consumer canunderstand. We recognize that we can test for the Seasonal Energy EfficiencyRatio (SEER) and Heating Seasonal Performance Factor (HSPF) of this unitunder existing test procedures, and the unit can be rated accordingly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, these procedures do not describe to consumers this heat pump'strue measure of efficiency or give credit for the water heating feature.Our recommended procedure, which is compatible with current Departmentof Energy test procedures for heat pumps and water heaters, is includedin the attached documents with supporting technical information. The procedurewe are proposing can be used to test any central air conditioner or heatpump that also heats domestic hot water, such as units which include desuperheaters.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The procedure being proposed is similar but not identical to one draftedby NIST at the request of DOE and EPRI. This similarity is in the datagathering sections of each procedure, not in the way that data are appliedto establishing systems efficiency ratings. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Specifically, the Carrier procedures take less time, and thus areless costly, yet are felt to provide sufficient data to develop <T3>realistic</T3> system efficiency ratings. The detailed differencesbetween these two procedures are provided as Attachment A.\1\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Attachment A is available upon request from DOE. <ITAG tagnum="21">Specifically, we request a waiver of test procedures to allow theHydroTech 2000 system to be tested and rated with an equivalent SeasonalEnergy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) and an equivalent Heating Seasonal PerformanceFactor (HSPF) so that consumers will have a clear understanding of thisproduct's energy-saving capability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Energy Policy and Conservation Act was passed to conserve energy.This product is a quantum leap toward the goals set forth in that legislation.Energy conservation is now even more important as the issue of global warmingbecomes a matter of national and international concern. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The recent history of heat pump development in the United States reflectsa steady progression toward more energy-efficient equipment. The year 1974brought widespread acknowledgement and acceptance of the single-speed heatpump's energy-conserving abilities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Two-speed heat pumps in 1978 and variable-speed units in 1986 increasedenergy conservation further. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Carrier's new unit, the HydroTech 2000 system, now provides the stepbeyond the energy-saving capability of variable speed. By integrating domesticwater heating, which accounts for as much as <T3>one-third</T3> of the energy used in a home, energy-savings can beextended as much as 20% beyond today's variable speed heat pumps. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Consumers will be able to recoup their higher initial investment inHydroTech 2000 quickly through reduced energy bills. But again, they mustbe able to evaluate this new unit's energy-saving abilities in terms theyunderstand. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The HydroTech 2000 heat pump is a natural progression in the trendtoward more energy-efficient equipment. However, we must be able to presentthis new system's energy efficiency in a way that is familiar and understoodby consumers so they can make rational comparisons. Therefore, we are requestinga waiver and the ability to present this unit's efficiency in terms ofequivalent SEER and HSPF, which are measurements and comparisons that consumersunderstand. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Our recommended approach to rating this new system is as follows.Because the HydroTech 2000 unit provides virtually free water heating duringthe cooling mode, and reduced energy consumption for water heating duringthe space heating mode and water heating only modes, the resulting energy-usereduction from that of conventional electric resistance heat water heatersshould be applied to the unit's space cooling and heating performance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This is illustrated in Attachment B. In (1) the energy consumptionof the HydroTech 2000 and its HSPF and SEER are shown when tested as aheat pump only without its water heating function included. The energy-usevalues shown for DHW are based on the consumption of a typical householdelectric resistance water heater. In (2) is shown total annual energy consumptionfor comfort heating and cooling and water heating when tested as an integratedappliance. Here the reduction in the system's energy consumption (in kWh)is applied to water heating. Therefore, the HSPF and SEER remain the same(9.0 and 14.0 respectively). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In (3), however, the reduction in total energy consumption is appliedto heating and cooling and not to water heating. (Note that the KWH ofenergy consumption for domestic hot water is identical in scenarios 1 and3.) Therefore, the unit's HSPF becomes 11.0 and its SEER becomes 20.4.These are the numbers that Carrier Corporation believes represent the system'strue efficiencies and are appropriate to present to the consumer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It has been suggested that dollars (annual operating cost) be usedas a comparative. No listing showing combined costs of heat pumps and waterheaters exists against which the operating cost of the HydroTech 2000 couldbe compared. Furnace fact sheets have not been effective in comparing totalgas and electric operating costs of gas-fired furnaces. AFUE is the genericcomparative used to make gas furnace purchase decisions just as SEER andHSPF are the descriptors used to judge comparative efficiency of heat pumps.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As a nation, the United States is becoming increasingly concernedwith energy conservation, the burning of fossil fuels, and the greenhouseeffect. The nation has also been concerned that American corporations aretaking the short-term approach to the future and are not investing forthe long term. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Carrier Corporation, through its new HydroTech 2000 unit, is addressingboth of these major issues: energy conservation and long-term investment.We request that the Department of Energy recognizes this investment, andtherefore we respectfully request a waiver from current DOE test procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A waiver will enable Carrier to present the true energy-saving capabilityof this new system to the consumer. Without the waiver, consumers willnot be afforded the opportunity to understand the actual energy-savingpotential of this unit and will be disadvantaged when making their equipment-buyingdecisions. They will not have useful comparative information to help themmake an informed purchasing decision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Respectfully submitted,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward A. Baily,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Vice President, Government andamp; Industry Relations, North AmericanOperations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Attachment A_Comparison With NIST Draft Report</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The testing and rating procedure recommended by Carrier Corporationare similar to those recommended in a recent NIST project which addressesthe same type of equipment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The results of the NIST study have been compiled into a draft reportby Brian Dougherty entitled ``A Proposed Methodology for Rating Air-Source,Integrated Heat Pump/Water Heating Appliances having Combined and DedicatedWater Heating'', which will be published in the near future as a NISTIRreport. Although NIST project was done independently, the results are similarto those in the Carrier proposal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Differences between the two proposals exist in two areas: (1) Thetype and number of tests, and (2) the methodology for deriving the ratingdescriptors. The principal differences can be summarized as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Test Points. </T3>NIST, like Carrier, proposes two simulated use tests(dynamic draw tests). NIST proposes tests at ourdoor temperatures of 47Fand 82F; Carrier proposes 17F and 67F because we feel that these bettercover the wide range of water heating capacities. NIST proposes a singledraw, Carrier proposes a more complex 4-draw schedule which is more representativeof typical households. For the combined space cooling/DHW mode, Carrierproposes 2 tests which cover the range of operation in this mode, 67F withlow compressor speed and 95F with high compressor speed, with a simpleinterpolation between these two points. NIST Added two more intermediatepoints at 82F in order to cover the shift between desuperheating and fullcondensing water heating. Although these extra points would better describethe system performance, we do not believe that the net effects would justifythe added testing and analysis burden. For the combined space heat/DHWmode, Carrier proposes that one cyclic test and one steady state test beperformed at 17F representing system performance at a lower DHW capacityis low (It is higher in all other tests). NIST had proposed these testsat 47F only.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Methodology. </T3>Both proposals use temperature bin type procedures.NIST averages the daily DHW load (converted to BTUs) evenly over a 24 hourperiod, resulting in a low load (less than 2000 BTU/hour). We feel thatthis will over-estimate the capabilities of an integrated DHW unit, especiallylow-capacity, desuperheating-only types, since DHW loads are normally discreteand require quick responses with capacities comparable to 4.5 kW (15358BTU/hr) tank heater elements. If heat pump equipment has lower capacities,the auxiliary elements will be used. If the load is always low, the useof auxiliary elements will be under-estimated. Carrier proposes splittingthe typical day into two parts_an active draw period (all draws, high BTU/hrloads) and a standby period (no draws, low BTU/hr loads).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Concerning rating and reporting descriptors, Carrier proposes theuse of equivalent SEER and HSPF factors, which combine the system energysavings accrued in all operating modes, into factors (SEER and HSPF) whichare universally accepted and understood by both manufacturers and purchasersof heat pump equipment. By using SEER and HSPF factors, the benefits ofthe advanced heat pump system are related to the operating modes (spacecooling and heating) which account for the major energy costs to the consumerand to which he would be most responsive. The use of overall system efficiencyfactors (including space heating and cooling and DHW), as proposed by NISTwould not effectively signal the true energy savings potential of advancedheat pumps to the consumer because (1) the numbers would be lower thanthe standard air-to-air SEER and HSPF values for conventional heat pumps,and (2) the use of a completely new efficiency term would confuse bothsales persons and consumers to the point that they may be ignored.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Attachment B._Variable-Speed Heat Pump System Annual Performance ReportingOptions </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[DOE Heating Region 4] </ITAG><H1>  </H1><H1>Annual energy use, KWH </H1><H2>Heating </H2><H2>Cooling </H2><H1>HSPF </H1><H1>SEER</H1>1.
