In cogeneration, both electricity and steam are produced from a single fuel.    The agreement calls for Consumers, Dow Chemical Co. and other yet-to-be named equity partners to invest $600 million in new capital to build the gas-fired plant. Dow Chemical, of Midland, will use steam and electricity generated by the plant.    The companies said the plant will be completed in phases, with the first power coming on line by 1990. At full capacity, they said, the plant is expected to produce 1.3 million kilowatts of electricity. </TEXT></DOC>
