My wife has met most of them, and I constantly tellall of them how happy we are. I can't believe they still omit her.;    Am I toassume that an invitation from a longtime friend includes my darling wife?Should I inquire when I respond?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TELL FRIENDS TO INVITE THE WIFE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  AdviceMiss Manners is the pseudonym of Washington, D.C.-based writer Judith Martin.Her columns appear Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays.  </MEMO><TEXT>     GENTLE READER -- What you are describing is an increasing tendency -- whichMiss Manners deplores -- to ignore the factor of the social couple and treateach person, attached or not, as a loner.;    This should not be takenpersonally by you or your wife, as it comes from general cynicism andlaziness. One rationale is that it is too much trouble to figure out whatconstitutes a couple, when divorce is so prevalent and there are so manysubmarital arrangements. Another is that social life is really an extension ofone's work, anyway, where spouses are only present on sufferance.;    MissManners believes you must, indeed, make the point with your friends. Askingyour wife to do so is not a good idea -- she already feels hurt by yourfriends' callousness and would seem to be pushing herself, rather thanresponding to your natural demand that she be accorded her proper place.;   DEAR MISS MANNERS -- My sister and I inherited Granny's beautiful countryhouse. We both live a good distance away but were lucky enough to find acompetent, trustworthy young woman as caretaker.;    In Granny's day, eachmorning the general factotum would remove his hat and clear his throat at thedining-room door, and Granny would invite him in for a short chat about theday's chores. She would then ask after his family, and the interview was over.If the weather was inclement, she would offer him a cup of coffee, which heenjoyed in the kitchen.;    Our caretaker, too, appears each morning, but shenever fails to extend the conversation into a lengthy social one. If we havehouse guests, she is even more difficult to dislodge, often helping herself tocoffee from the sideboard.;    To steer her into the kitchen simply means weare separated from family and guests while our breakfast gets cold. Worse,despite such &quot;end games&quot; as &quot;Well, I mustn't keep you&quot; or &quot;I must get back tomy guests,&quot; she follows us right back to the dining room.;    My sister and Iresent her marathon visitations when we wish to enjoy family and friends, butit is worse when we are alone. To be alone used to mean a chance to sit on theporch with morning coffee and meditate on the lapping waves -- now animpossibility.;    How can we reclaim our porch and guests and vacationswithout damaging her dignity?;    GENTLE READER -- Your grandmother and hercaretaker came from a time when employer and employee equally understood thata formal relationship was easier on them both than a pseudo-social one.;   What you can do, as her employer, is to reward her with time off. Aftershowering her with deserved praise, tell her to take some time for herself, asyou will be entertaining friends, anyway; or tell her you will look afterthings for yourself for a while, as you feel you need the solitude.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Miss Manners  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910523  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  580  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 23, 199100144067,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
