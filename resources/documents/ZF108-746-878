As they say in this new area calledvirtual reality&quot;, a direct  experience is worth a thousand words.andM;Imagine that you have been assigned the task of designing and organizing theinstrument panel of a successor to the space shuttle.andP;  You sit in a mockup ofthe Pilot's chair and put on a pair of goggles which show you a stereoscopicview of a shuttle's simulated cockpit.andP;  Looking left, you See the left sideof the cockpit; the corresponding effect occurs when you look to the right.andO;The instrument panel lies in front of you, a complicated arrangement of dialsand displays.andP;  You decide that a Particular instrument is too difficult toread, and grasp the instrument with your fingers to slide it to anotherlocation, moving it &quot;naturally&quot; and effortlessly.andM;Or, suppose you are a brain sur on scheduled to perform an operation toremove a tumor.andP;  The tumor's position in the brain makes its removal risky.andO;TO decide how best to proceed, you and a fellow doctor each don the goggles,which provide you with a three-dimensional model of the patient's brain.andP;  Youuse your vantage point inside the body to examine the tumor's Position fromotherwise impossible angles.andP;  Your colleague makes several observations,pointing out possible pitfalls.andP;  Both of you come away from the briefconference assured that you have made the best decisions possible concerningthe operation.andM;Consider yet another episode.andP;  At your leisure, you settle back intosomething like an easy chair, the goggles once again strapped to your head.andO;Two friends ma be positioned in similar chairs in adjacent booths.andP;  The threeof you are fighter PilOts in an interplanetary war; your opponents are threeother spare-time  fighter pilots&quot; who actually reside in a remote part of thecountry.andP;  If your team wins this simulated battle, you will split a cashprize.andP;  If you lose, you'll have stories to tell about the fight.andP;  You makeyourself comfortable, tensed for battle yet confidently relaxed as the firstphoton torpedo explodes off the starboard bow.andM;Virtual Reality (VR) is the name of an emerging computer technology that willmake the above scenarios possible.andP;  By providing stereoscopic video and full3D audio, VR gives users the impression of being in a separate,self-contained world.andP;  The user sees and hears sights and sounds that existonly in the computer's memory.andP;  Computerized clothing can be used to registerthe user's body position and utilize that data in such a way that enablesparts of the body to &quot;interact&quot; with objects in a  virtual world&quot;.andM;Notable advances in VR technology include the Eye-Phones and the DataGlove,two novel computer peripherals developed by VPL Research in Redwood City, CA.andO;The EyePhones are a stereoscopic, head-mounted computer display that lookslike an oversized pair of goggles.andP;  Worn over the eyes, the EyePhones areheld on the head by straps so that all external light is blocked out.andP;  Insidethe EyePhones are two color-display screens, one for each eye.andP;  The imagesthat appear on the two screens are slightly different, giving the illusion ofdepth when seen together.andP;  The apparatus displays a wide-angle video image,similar in effect to a movie viewed on a very wide screen.andP;  Users have theimpression of being inside the scene being displayed.andM;The DataGlove is a black glove made of Lycra, with flex sensors running alongthe back of each finger.andP;  The sensors use fiber-optics technology todetermine the bend of each joint, and are very light and flexible so as notto interfere with finger movement.andM;Wearers of the EyePhones and DataGlove are transported into anotherenvironment-or, you might say, into another reality.andP;  The 3D view theEyePhones present exists as a database of polygons in a computer.andP;  By sensingthe position of the user's head, the EyePhones can realistically adjust the3D view in real time as the user looks left and right.andP;  The DataGlove sensesthe position and digitation of the users' hands, enabling users to manipulateobjects in VR and to send commands to the computer using hand gestures.andM;Both peripherals are used in concert with the Convolvotron, a digital-audiosystem developed by Crystal River Engineering.andP;  The Convolvotron uses digitalaudio-filtering technology to position sounds in 3D space through the use ofnormal stereo headphones.andP;  The system allows sounds to accompany objects inVR; as an object moves, the sound it makes follows it realistically.andM;The first head-mounted computer display was built by Ivan Sutherland in the1960s.andP;  It had to be mechanically suspended from the ceiling because of itslarge size and weight, and used television tubes to provide the stereo imageand mechanical linkages to register head position.andP;  The EyePhones, bycontrast, use small, flat-panel displays.andP;  They employ electromagneticposition-sensing capabilities and weigh only eight pounds, allowing them tobe worn directly on the user's head in relative comfort.andM;Tom Furness, head of the Human Interface Technologies Laboratory (HITL) inSeattle, was among the first to do practical research incorporatinghead-mounted display technology.andP;  Under contract from the US Air Force, heand his colleagues developed a &quot;super cockpit&quot; that provided pilots withunprecedented control over simulated aircraft and weapons systems.andP;  HITL'slong-term goal is to define a new generation of human-machine interface basedon VR technology.andP;  The interface will allow people to interact with computersin ways that more closely match the ways humans interact with one another.andM;Researchers at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, are currentlypursuing several avenues of research relating to VR.andP;  UNC builds thePixel-Planes computer, a parallel-processing system that assigns one computerto each pixel.andP;  This innovation gives the PixelPlanes machine the computingpower necessary to render 3D scenes in real time.andM;In the field of medical research, radiation is often used by oncologists tokill malignant tumors.andP;  Radiation treatment can be administered in such a waythat the tumor receives a huge dose of radiation while the surrounding tissueabsorbs a much smaller dose: if, say, 100 beams of radiation are aimed at thetumor from different angles, the tumor itself is irradiated by all 100 beams,yet the surrounding tissue is exposed to only a few beams.andP;  Such a procedureis a delicate one, as radiation can also kill healthy tissue.andP;  The accuracywith which the beams are pointed is of great importance.andP;  Certain tissues,such as those of the eyes and nervous system, are particularly susceptible todamage from radiation.andM;In response to this need, Jim Chung, a researcher at UNC, is working on asystem that will eventually use the EyePhones to replicate the experience ofmoving around inside a patient's body.andP;  With this new mode of visualization,a doctor will be able to place computer-simulated radiation sources so thatthe tumor can be irradiated evenly with minimal damage to the surroundingtissue.andM;Molecule imaging has always been a popular application of computer graphics.andO;One persistent problem in this field has been maintaining clarity ascomplexity increases: as the molecules displayed become more complex, thefeatures of a molecular shape become harder to distinguish withoutdepth-related cues.andP;  VR technology allows scientists to see complex moleculesin 3D with full depth perception, and permits them to &quot;walk around&quot; themolecules, to examine them from a variety of angles.andP;  Research is under wayat UNC to develop the means by which scientists can &quot;pick up&quot; and manipulatethe molecules they are analyzing.andM;For example, UNC researchers are using a special I/O device called aforce-feedback arm.andP;  A scientist puts his arm into this device, whichresembles an enormous, shoulder-length, metal glove with pulleys.andP;  The devicesenses the position of the scientist's arm and hand, and pushes against hisarm and hand to make him feel that an object in the virtual world is pressingagainst him.andP;  With this tool the scientist can &quot;hold&quot; a molecule in his handand position it against another molecular surface while he watches and feelshow well the two bind chemically.andP;  The computer and force-feedback armactually simulate the tug of the electrons as the atoms rub against oneanother.andP;  Researchers anticipate that this study could lead to methods fordeveloping more effective custom-designed medications.andM;To complete the environment that the EyePhones and the DataGlove present tousers, VPL has developed two VR systems-RB1 (Reality Built for 1) and RB2.andO;The systems provide tools for the creation and experience of new  virtualworlds&quot;.andP;  Two UNIX-based Silicon Graphics Iris 4D/210GTX systems areused--one for each virtual eye&quot;- to generate the stereo video image.andO;Hardware accelerators provide the compute power necessary to render real-time3D color graphics.andM;Virtual worlds are drawn using Swivel 3D, a modeling program for theMacintosh.andP;  Using the program an artist can create complex shapes and placethem in certain positions relative to one another in space.andP;  An entire scenecan be rotated and viewed from any angle.andP;  The artist eventually puts a headand a hand into the scene, which become the user's head and hand in virtualreality.andM;But a virtual world involves more than a three-dimensional scene-the behaviorof objects in a scene must also be considered.andP;  Another Mac program, BodyElectric, imbues objects in the virtual world with various behaviors.andP;  Theprogram can be used to specify whether an object is &quot;grabbable&quot; or whetherthe user's hand will simply pass through it.andP;  Moreover, an object can begiven &quot;gravity&quot;, so that it will fall back to the floor after being picked upand let go.andM;Another aspect of the RB system is that it can recognize hand gesturestransmitted by the DataGlove interface as commands to the computer.andP;  A userwho points with one finger in a particular direction will get the visualimpression of  flying&quot; in that direction; pointing with two fingers causes&quot;backward flight&quot;.andP;  Making a &quot;devil's horns&quot; sign (index and little fingersextended, middle and ring fingers curled) causes the user to return instantlyto a predetermined home position.andP;  Other commands can be set up as well.andM;Body Electric provides a unified solution to diverse programming problemswith a programming language called Flex.andP;  Flex departs from the usualcomputer-language tradition in being visually oriented; programming is donemore with the mouse than with the keyboard.andP;  In Flex, the programmerconstructs a data-flow diagram that describes how hand- and head-positioninformation are processed to cause behavior meaningful in VR.andM;To make such a diagram, the user places rectangles on the screen and drawsconnections between them.andP;  Each rectangle represents a module that interpretsdata at its inputs and presents a transform of that data at its outputs.andP;  Amodule that performed negation, for instance, would receive a single numberas input and negate it, sending the negative to its single output.andP;  Such amodule would appear graphically as a rectangle with one line connecting toits left and right sides, representing one input and one output.andP;  Modules maybe combined to achieve more complex transformations by drawing connectionsbetween their inputs and outputs.andP;  The raw data put into the data-flowdiagram comes from position sensors on the EyePhones and the DataGlove; theoutputs from the diagram can be used to specify the positions of objects inVR, including the position of the user's eyes in the virtual space.andM;Ethernet connects Body Electric to the SGI machines that generate the stereovideo for VR.andP;  The program continuously sends position information for theobjects presented in the virtual space to a program called Isaac, which runson each SGI machine.andP;  Isaac provides the real-time animation of the video,using SGI's hardware and software package to render a full-color 3D view ofthe virtual space in real time.andP;  The video output of the SGI machines isconnected to displays in the EyePhones.andM;Virtual worlds may contain any number of things.andP;  They are limited only bythe designer's imagination.andP;  Demonstration worlds designed at VPL typicallyhave a whimsical quality.andP;  One world consists of two walls and a floor.andO;Beyond them is the limitless void.andP;  A large banana hangs in midair near onewall, rotating lazily end over end.andP;  A black-and-white top hat and a hugebunch of purple grapes hover nearby.andP;  A table sits in the corner, and in ahot tub a little yellow duck bobs back and forth.andP;  In the sky is the largeround yellow disk of the sun, a cloud, and something else-sky sculpture! Twocolumns extend upward: one is tenuous and frail-looking, made of thintriangles; the other is made of lengths of hexagonal pipe, stuck roughlytogether at the ends and spiraling gently into the sky.andM;What does the future hold? Reasonably priced hardware is just barely able tohandle the computing requirements of VR.andP;  Fortunately, the cost ofcomputation continues to plummet, and inexpensive desktop machines that cancompute a 3D image of a scene in real time are coming closer to non-virtualreality.andP;  A VR system from VPL Research currently costs over $200,000-placingit within the realm of expensive tools for large research institutions.andP;  Sometime in the next ten years we can expect to see VR systems priced at a tenthof that cost.andM;Head-mounted display technology still stands to benefit enormously fromfurther research.andP;  The tiny video displays do not yet have a resolution highenough for placement so close to the eyes; the images are rough and not atall photorealistic.andP;  Head-mounted displays are light in weight, but theycould be lighter still.andP;  Wouldn't it be nice to have a head-mounted displayas small and light as a pair of glasses, complete with stereo headphones anda tiny microphone?andM;Ray tracing, the computation-intensive technique that produces photorealisticgraphics, can require today's supercomputers to commit anywhere from minutesto weeks to compute a single frame of high-quality graphics output.andP;  Today'sVR systems draw objects as meshes of polygons, each of which has one color.andO;In more advanced systems, each polygon can have a texture mapped to it; thepolygon can be drawn with a pattern (texture) on its surface so as to mimicthe true appearance of various physical materials.andP;  Polygon meshes produceimages of objects that are convincingly solid in appearance, yet still lackphotorealism.andP;  With an increase in computation speed of a few orders ofmagnitude, ray-tracing techniques could be used to compute the images for VRon desktop systems.andM;Televirtuality, another technology on the horizon, would allow users to meetwith other users from whom they are physically distant.andP;  Given the eventualintroduction by the telephone company of high-speed data networks, it willbecome possible to offer the consumer a tele-VR service.andP;  A family's holidayphone calls would become more like reunions than ever.andP;  Televirtualconferencing could become popular, allowing business people to hold meetingsaround conference tables in virtual space.andM;Virtual reality is a technology which has only recently come within reach,and the requirements in terms of computation and materials that VR places onthe state of the art are substantial.andP;  Demand for this exciting new imagingtechnology should contribute to the development of better and less expensivehardware.andP;  In the past, the introductions of new computer technologies, suchas microprocessors, has bolstered the growth of many new industries.andP;  Somebelieve virtual reality will be of comparable importance in influencing thegrowth of even more new industries in the years to come.andM;Marc de Groot is a senior computer scientist at VPL Research Inc. Aprogramming veteran of 20 years (in a career that began at the age of 10), hehas run the gamut of software development, from creating video games atUnison World to writing UNIX internals for Microport.andP;  For fun, he's involvedwith a wireless computer-networking project using amateur radio.andP;  At present,de Groot is working on the design and implementation of a new 3D editor.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
