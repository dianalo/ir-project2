The Rand Corp. report also contends that Iran continues tooverestimate the importance of the hostages to the U.S. government.   ``The fate of the ... hostages is a matter of concern ... but itis not a central issue,'' the study said. ``The government is underno immediate pressure from the public to bring the hostages home.''   The longest held of the Americans is Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press. Anderson waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   Veteran terrorist researcher Brian Michael Jenkins said in thereport, ``Terrorism: Policy Issues for the Bush Administration,''that hostages provide a group ``with a certain amount of prestige.''   Iran, the study said, has lost much of its strategic importanceto the United States, in part because of improved U.S.-Sovietrelations and because world oil production remains high andcomparatively cheap.   ``To put it bluntly, in a way that no U.S. official can saypublicly, Washington can wait'' for a more receptive government inIran, even as ``dealing through Iran remains ... our best bet forgetting the hostages released,'' according to the report.   But Jenkins said there are ``powerful forces'' in Iran who``continue to oppose any kind of rapprochement with the West.''   ``None of the alternatives look very promising,'' Jenkins wrote.   ``Threatening the captors or Tehran with military retaliation... has emotional appeal but is not likely to work and mightimperil the hostages. Rescue ... is a long shot, especially if weare concerned with getting the hostages out alive.   ``That leaves ransom, a distasteful course of action but onewhich should not be ruled out entirely,'' Jenkins said, adding thatthe U.S. no-concession policy that emerged after the Iran-Contraarms scandal ``has become dangerously rigid.''   ``Most nations subscribe to no-concessions policies in theory,''he said. ``In practice, however, many of them have made deals toobtain the release of their citizens held hostage, although theymay deny that the apparent concessions were part of any deal, orargue that these things were done for loftier purposes.''   Even Israel, the nation seen to exemplify the hard line, ``hason several occasions made concessions to obtain the release ofhostages.''   Part of the problem, the report said, is that the captors havenot been clear or consistent about exactly what they want in returnfor the release of the hostages.   The Rand Corp., a Santa Monica, Calif.-based private, non-profitorganization, sponsors research, often under government contract,on issues affecting national security.   Though the terrorism study was spawned by an earlier projectsponsored by the Defense Department, Rand said it paid for thereport out of its own funds.</TEXT></DOC>
