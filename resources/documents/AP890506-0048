There has been no claim of responsibility in Thursday'sincident, which is believed linked to the trial of a Lebanesehijacker in Frankfurt, West Germany.   The 25-year-old was kidnapped by five unidentified gunmen onSidon's southern edge along with two fellow relief workers from theASME-Humanitas agency, Heinrich Struebig and Petra Schnitzler.   Struebig, 48, and Schnitzler, 26, were released Friday. They metthe Nasserite militia's leader Mustafa Saad in Sidon for 10minutes, but refused to talk to the press. Struebig is anadministrator and Schnitzler a nurse.   ``The released two haven't donated any significant informationabout the captors or their motives,'' the source said. He refusedto be named.   ``They only said they wanted to talk to their headquarters inGermany and to their government. It seems they wanted to relay someinformation to Germany,'' the source added.   The West German Embassy refused comment on the case.   In Bonn, West German Foreign Ministry spokesman Hans Schumachernoted that Struebig and Schnitzler had disappeared for two days inLebanon under similar circumstances a year ago.   He said he considered the latest 10-hour disappearance ``a bitstrange.''   The three worked from a base between the Palestinian refugeecamps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh on Sidon's eastern edge. TheSidon region, 25 miles south of Beirut, is a PLO stronghold.   Lt. Col. Wajih Abu Ali, commander of the PLO's military policein the Sidon region and in charge of protecting the ASME-Humanitasbase, also said the two who were released have refused to cooperatewith investigators.   ``They refused to give us any information about the kidnappers,their demands, if any, and the place where they were held,'' AbuAli told reporters in Mieh Mieh. ``They only said they werethreatened.''   On Friday, Abu Ali said Struebig and Schnitzler told him thekidnappers have threatened to kill Michael if they divulged anyinformation about the abduction.   The daily newspaper Al-Liwaa, which publishes in Moslem westBeirut, said the captors wanted a ``lenient sentence'' for MohammedAli Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem terrorist held in Frankfurt.It cited no source for the report.   West German prosecutors have demanded a life sentence for Hamadifor involvement in the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner in which aU.S. Navy diver was shot to death and his body tossed onto theairport tarmac, two U.S. men were severely beaten and 37 otherpassengers were held hostage 17 days.   Abu Ali refused comment on the newspaper report, but a deputysaid Friday the two released told him the kidnapping was linked toHamadi.   The source at the Nasserite militia said: ``I find it strange.If the kidnappers want to pressure the Germans, then why did theyrelease two German hostages?''   A verdict in Hamadi's case is expected within two weeks.   Hamadi's elder brother, Abdul-Hadi, heads the security apparatusfor the Iranian-backed extremist group Hezbollah, or Party of God,which is the umbrella organization for underground pro-Iranianfactions holding Western captives.   In addition to Michael, there are 15 foreigners held in Lebanon_ nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and aBelgian.   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
