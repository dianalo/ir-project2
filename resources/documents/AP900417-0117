DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A New York-based securities firm agreed to pay$5.6 million to customers for stock sold in partial tender offerswithout prior client approval, federal officials said Tuesday.   Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. and a managingdirector, Michael Dreitlein, agreed to settle _ without admittingor denying wrongdoing _ an administrative action alleging theyviolated Securities and Exchange Commission anti-fraud andrecord-keeping rules.   The action, brought by the SEC's New York Regional Office, thefirm's Pershing Division of making $4.3 million in tender offerprofits from the ``unauthorized and undisclosed'' sale of sharesfrom customer accounts.   A tender offer is an offer to buy a corporation's shares _ oftenas a means of acquiring the concern _ usually at a premium price.   According to the SEC, the division, then directed by Dreitlein,tendered shares belonging to customers who had not given anyinstructions to do so. The shares were later replaced, usually withstock bought at a lower price after the tender offer. DLJ kept anyprofits from the difference between the sale and repurchase price.   The alleged activity, known as overtendering, took place betweenJanuary 1982 and April 1988, according to the SEC.   ``Securities transactions are predicated on trust. DLJ misusedthat trust when it confiscated customers' securities for itsbenefit,'' said Martin A. Kuperberg, the SEC's associate regionaladministrator in New York.   As part of the settlement with the SEC, DLJ agreed to pay $4.3million plus interest for a total of $5.6 million to customerswhose shares were used in the overtendering.</TEXT></DOC>
