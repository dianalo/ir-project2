The program, begun last year and disclosed in ATandamp;T's proxystatement for this year's annual meeting, makes stock-optiongrants to a group of senior officers, including Robert E.Allen, chairman and chief executive officer, over and abovetheir usual compensation packages. The novel feature of thenew options is that most of them can be exercised only if thecompany's share price improves by certain amounts. A quarterof the options can be exercised at the market price on theday they were granted, the rest only if the price rises 20%to 50%.</LP><TEXT>   A handful of companies so far have experimented with suchso-called &quot;premium-priced&quot; options. &quot;It's really quiteuncommon,&quot; says Eric Scoones, a principal with compensationconsulting firm William M. Mercer Inc.   But because of ATandamp;T's size and visibility, its move couldprove a powerful boost to the concept of premium options.And, compensation experts say, the increasing scrutiny ofexecutive pay is putting pressure on more and more companiesto link pay to performance. &quot;We are likely to see a lot moreof these in the future,&quot; says Louis Brindisi, of consultingfirm Strategic Compensation Associates. He says he isdeveloping such programs for clients now.   The apparent virtues of such programs are that executivesdon't profit until the stock price has risen. &quot;Thecompensation committee feels that the share owners have tobenefit before the executives do,&quot; says an ATandamp;T spokesman,who said the company's plan puts more of the executives'compensation pay at risk.   But in ATandamp;T's case, there's little risk to the executivesbecause the new stock-option program simply offers apotential addition to regular salary and stock options.   The proxy shows that Mr. Allen's salary and bonus lastyear increased about 2% to $2.1 million. A company spokesmanadded that Mr. Allen's pay from certain longer-term incentiveprograms increased 24%, to $673,366 from $543,018.   The proxy also discloses that last year Mr. Allen wasgiven 312,526 stock options. Of those, the company says,62,526 are considered a regular annual stock-option grant,which compares with a grant of 44,898 in the year earlier.   The remainder of last year's grant, options on 250,000shares, is a special onetime grant that can be exercised over10 years. Of those options, the company says that one-quartercan be exercised at the market value on the date of thegrant, which the proxy puts at $38.69. The next quarter canbe exercised at $46.43, which is market value plus 20%; thenext quarter at $50.29, or market value plus 30%; the finalquarter can be exercised at $58.03, which is market valueplus 50%.   A stock option is the right to buy a share of stock at afixed price some time in the future. That fixed price isnormally the market price of the stock on the date of thegrant. Some companies occasionally make grants at a discountfrom current market price. Only a few executives' grants,among them a grant to Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive MichaelEisner, are at prices above market value.   It is harder for an executive to gain under the ATandamp;Tprogram because the stock price on a large portion of thegrant must rise first. But because of the big amount ofoptions, the potential profit is large.   Using one common pricing method, Mr. Allen's specialoption grant has a value today of $2.3 million.   What's more, an executive could gain handsomely even froma moderate increase in the company's stock price. If thestock price appreciates by no more than 15.9% a year, whichis the telecommunication industry's median annual stock-priceincrease over the past five years, Mr. Allen's options wouldbe worth about $30 million in 2001, at the end of their10-year life, says Kate Morgans, a principal with StrategicCompensation Associates. &quot;It's a lot of additionalcompensation,&quot; she says.   An ATandamp;T spokesman said that if the stock price appreciatesthat much, the company also would fare well. At the same rateof growth, he says, the market value of the company wouldgrow to $200 billion from today's $50 billion level.   Analysts expect this kind of compensation arrangement tobecome more common as companies increasingly react tocriticism that executive pay isn't closely enough tied toperformance.   ATandamp;T says that its plan was set in motion before paycriticism heated up in Congress and in shareholder groups.   Still, in describing the new program, the ATandamp;T spokesmanreplied to critics of high executive pay, who also chargethat pay is too oriented toward the short term. &quot;The basicreason we did this is that our chairman is committed tolong-term growth for the corporation,&quot; the spokesman said.&quot;We have passed the time of shrinking our way toprofitability. He strongly believes that one way {to grow} isto tie a large portion of potential compensation to thelong-term performance of the company. That's what theseoptions do.&quot;   Still, some figure the gains might not be that far away.Ms. Morgans estimates that at the median industry rate ofreturn, all of the new ATandamp;T options, including the mostexpensive ones, begin having some value after 2.75 years.   What's more, stock options themselves are coming underincreasing fire these days from critics who charge thatoptions reward stock market performance, not corporateperformance.   Besides Mr. Allen, the special grants were given to atleast four other senior executives, including Randall L.Tobias, vice chairman of the board, and three groupexecutives.</TEXT></DOC>
