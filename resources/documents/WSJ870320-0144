And Katharine Graham of the Washington Post Co. inherited the job, which both her father and her husband held.    Soon, however, Fortune 500 directors may be turning more and more to women when they tap new chief executive officers. &quot;It's inevitable,&quot; says Rand Corp. economist James P. Smith. &quot;Large numbers of women are in the middle-management pipeline now, and in 10 years you'll see far more than one in the CEO ranks.&quot;    Executive women on the rise are choosing untraditional routes to the top. Instead of climbing a single corporate ladder rung by rung, some women are zigzagging their way higher, moving from company to company, industry to industry or from the private sector to public service and back again. Others are departing from the usual big business management routes to nurture -- or acquire -- companies of their own. And some women develop so much expertise in new, technology-linked fields that they can't be overlooked.    Here are five of the women who, experts say, stand a better-than-even chance of becoming Fortune 500 chief executives by 1997:    DEBORAH COLEMAN   Vice President, Operations, Apple Computer Inc.    Her dream was to run a factory and combine &quot;the best manufacturing technology with the best people-management.&quot; When she joined Apple Computer Inc. in 1981 as controller of the Macintosh division, she struck a pact with company founder Steven Jobs to let her run the new Macintosh plant if she built the best finance team in the industry.    Today, 34-year-old Deborah A. Coleman is known throughout Silicon Valley as a high-technology manufacturing wizard. At Apple's Fremont, Calif., Macintosh plant, where several of her predecessors had been fired, she ended production havoc in six months -- eliminating computer-driven equipment that wasn't &quot;people friendly,&quot; slashing inventory and boosting productivity.    &quot;A lot of what I did was common sense,&quot; says Ms. Coleman, who routinely pulled everyone in the plant together to set monthly goals and, as she puts it, &quot;foster a shared vision.&quot; As a result, assembly line workers agreed to work 12-hour shifts at times to meet certain production schedules, and the labor rate was reduced to less than 30 minutes for each Macintosh.    Promoted to vice president of manufacturing in 1985, Ms. Coleman promptly reduced Apple's inventory 37%, introduced new delivery schedules and cut the number of vendors the company uses more than one-third, to less than 300.    Currently in charge of Apple's plants in Ireland, Singapore and California, the single Ms. Coleman, who holds an M.B.A. from Stanford University, hopes to &quot;work myself out of this job within two years.&quot; She predicts that as Apple grows, the company will be reorganized into separate business units, &quot;and I wouldn't mind running one of those major businesses.&quot;    KAREN HORN   Chairman and CEO-Elect, Banc One -- Cleveland Unit.    She has moved from the private sector to public service and back again, jumping several management rungs each time. The leap Karen Horn will make next month from president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to chairman and chief executive officer of Banc One Corp.'s Cleveland unit, with $1.4 billion in assets, will make her the highest-ranking woman in U.S. banking.    The 43-year-old Mrs. Horn is known as a consummate strategist and crisis manager. At the Fed she helped resolve Ohio's thrift crisis in 1985, when the failure of Home State Savings Bank triggered a panic and prompted the closing of dozens of privately insured thrifts. She quickly scattered regulators across the state to identify troubled thrifts. Recognizing that Ohio's insurance pool wouldn't even cover Home State's losses, she also instituted a plan to monitor deposit withdrawals at the other institutions insured by the fund to forestall other failures.    But it is her ability to lead others that should help Mrs. Horn strengthen Banc One and that makes her an attractive potential candidate to head a non-banking concern. &quot;She has a presence that drives the best in people,&quot; says Linda Page, Ohio's banking commissioner. &quot;She'll look at you in a very engaging way and say, 'Tell me about that.' You can see her mind churning with thoughts, but she always makes you feel that you're helping resolve the problem.&quot;    Mrs. Horn says she devotes as much time as possible to her husband of 21 years and their 4-year-old son. But she rejects the label &quot;superwoman.&quot; &quot;I haven't met one yet,&quot; she says. &quot;I do a lot of things at home and in business, but I have a lot of people helping me.&quot;    Kay Koplovitz   President and CEO, USA Network    She started her career as a television producer in Milwaukee and soon concluded that &quot;the best way to get to the top for a woman is to start at the top with a business of her own. If I'd stayed in Milwaukee, I never would have made it to station manager.&quot;    Kay Koplovitz founded USA Network in 1980 and shaped it to become the No. 1 cable network in terms of viewership and the first to use on-air advertisers. Today the network provides around-the-clock programming to 33 million households through 8,500 systems. And with revenue last year of about $80 million, USA Network -- jointly owned by Time Inc., Gulf andamp; Western Inc.'s Paramount Pictures Corp. unit and MCA Inc. -- is continuing to grow 20% to 30% annually.    What has set USA Network apart is its diverse programming. Ms. Koplovitz, who is 41, was the first to negotiate national cable rights to major-league sports. She also launched an award-winning children's program series as well as adult dramas and movies.    &quot;Instead of simply carving out one little niche like a lot of cable companies, she's taken on a mix of distinguished programming,&quot; says Mel Harris, president of Paramount's television group and a member of USA Network's executive committee. &quot;She could handle a Fortune 500 board.&quot;    Married to attorney William Koplovitz Jr., she says, &quot;I wanted to be president of CBS when I started in television. But my job now may be more challenging. We're the upstarts trying to chip into the broadcast guys' territory.&quot;    COLOMBE NICHOLAS   President, Christian Dior America   She familiarized the U.S. with the French name Dior and changed Dior's image from matronly to youthful. Her strategy boasted an advertising campaign that featured the escapades of a raffish menage a trois.    While company licensees at first were nervous that the ads were too risque, the campaign hooked consumers. Under Colombe Nicholas's direction, revenue at Christian Dior America has more than doubled in the past six years, to $315 million in 1986. The number of licensees making Dior products has jumped 45%.    Before taking over Dior's American arm, the 41-year-old Ms. Nicholas spent 10 years in New York retailing -- at Macy's and Bloomingdale's and at Bonwit Teller, where she was vice president of merchandising. But she believes her international background -- and fluency in French -- gave her the edge over several contenders for the Dior job.    The eldest daughter of an Ohio-businessman father and a French mother, Ms. Nicholas spent part of her childhood in Switzerland. At her father's insistence, she also acquired a law degree. &quot;I hated law school, but now I thank my father every day,&quot; she says. &quot;I learned how to think analytically.&quot;    Married to art collector Leonard Rosenberg, Ms. Nicholas describes herself as &quot;very goal-focused&quot; and &quot;a risk taker,&quot; but isn't a workaholic, she says. She rarely gets to her office before 9:30 a.m. and says, &quot;When I meet someone who tells me they've been up since 5, jogged 10 miles and gotten five kids off to school, I ask, 'Where's the coffee?'&quot;    Since it isn't likely that Christian Dior America will be spun off or go public, Ms. Nicholas would have to move to another company to become a Fortune 500 CEO. A multinational marketing concern would be her most likely move, executive recruiters say. She doesn't rule out that possibility, but says she also is considering a switch to politics. &quot;We need more women in government,&quot; she says, &quot;and a business background there could be very relevant.&quot;    LINDA WACHNER   President, Warnaco Inc.   She calls herself &quot;the first woman to succeed at the takeover game,&quot; a strategy that she figures was her swiftest route to the top.    Determined to head a large company, Linda Wachner last year spearheaded a leveraged buyout of Warnaco Inc., the Bridgeport, Conn.-based apparel manufacturer of Hathaway shirts, Pringle sweaters and a score of other well-known brands. Her goal is to make Warnaco &quot;the foremost apparel conglomerate in the world&quot; by doubling last year's sales of $575 million in five years. By then, the 41-year-old executive predicts, the company, which is Fortune 500 in size, could go public.    Ms. Wachner's marketing and turnaround expertise should serve her well. As vice president of Warnaco's Warner bras unit 12 years ago, she revolutionized that business by developing wireless bras and displaying them not in the customary boxes but simply on hangers. Later, as president of Beatrice Cos.' Max Factor cosmetics business, she nursed the faltering unit back to health, launching Le Jardin, Factor's first successful new perfume in years.    At Warnaco, where she puts in 14-hour days, Ms. Wachner has installed new managers and designers, and cut overhead by consolidating divisions. She shops in at least one department store each day &quot;to see what the competition is selling,&quot; often dragging Warnaco executives with her.    When she isn't visiting Warnaco plants or Paris fashion shows, Ms. Wachner, a widow, shuttles between apartments in Los Angeles and New York. She doesn't mind being called &quot;tough&quot; and &quot;driven&quot; by some subordinates, she says, &quot;as long as that means driven for a reason.    &quot;To make it to the top,&quot; she says, &quot;you've got to want it with all your heart.&quot;    ---   Ms. Hymowitz is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal's Pittsburgh bureau.
