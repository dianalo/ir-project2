Nine Southeastern states were spared telephone strikes as theCommunications Workers of America and BellSouth reached a tentativeagreement on a new, three-year contract late Saturday.   But technicians, operators , clerical personnel, sales andfactory workers at NYNEX Corp., Bell Atlantic Corp. and PacificTelesis began strikes Sunday after talks failed.   No talks were scheduled with NYNEX or Bell Atlantic, whichtogether provide telephone service to the Northeast andMid-Atlantic regions.   Informal talks were held Sunday in California between PacificTelesis, CWA and the International Brotherhood of ElectricalWorkers, but no progress was reported.   ``We are talking but we seem to be making very slow progress,''said CWA spokeswoman Vira Milirides.   No formal talks in any of the strikes were scheduled for Mondaybut informal bargaining was expected to continue, with resumptionof fomal negotiations hinging on those discussions.   People who dial direct should find little interruption inservice in the strike areas, company and union officials said.   But consumers needing operator or directory assistance oftenwere greeted Sunday with recordings saying heavy call volume hadslowed service _ and that situation would worsen with the start ofthe workweek Monday.   Installations and repairs also would be slowed if the strikesdrag on and the companies try to operate with management personnelin place of strikers.   In all three strike situations, the unions and companiesremained well apart on the issues of wages and health insurance,and a number of local issues remained unresolved in each set ofnegotiations as well. The debate over health insurance has been themajor obstacle, with the unions resisting companies' efforts toshift some costs to workers.   The greatest differences appear to be between the unions andNYNEX. That strike was called well before the midnight Saturdaydeadline because the differences were so great no formal talks wereheld Saturday.   CWA represents 40,000 NYNEX workers and IBEW an additional20,000. The company, based in New York, provides local phoneservice in New York and the six New England states and went througha nine-day strike three years ago.   ``We were prepared for this and got our management teams outthere at midnight,''' said NYNEX spokesman John Bonomo. ``Butthings may start to back up as we get the crunch on Monday.''   At Pacific Telesis, the strike was called at midnight Californiatime _ 3 a.m. EDT _ but negotiations continued through much of thenight. The talks recessed Sunday morning but were expected toresume although company officials said nothing was scheduledofficially. The company serves parts of California and all ofNevada and employs 44,500 union workers, all but 2,500 of them CWAmembers.   The strike deadline at Bell Atlantic was extended asnegotiations continued past midnight Saturday but a walkout wascalled just before 7 a.m. Sunday because of a lack of progress.   Edward G. Grogan, Bell Atlantic's vice president of laborrelations, expressed disappointment the union had rejected a``progressive settlement with a significant compensation package,improved health care services and a long list of family care andemployment security provisions.''   But the CWA's Bill Bickers said the company's offer of``retrogressive wages and benefits is a slap in the face to all ofour members.''   Bell Atlantic serves Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey,Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the nations capital. CWArepresents 41,000 Bell Atlantic workers, IBEW 11,500.   The BellSouth agreement provides an immediate 4 percent payincrease and cost of living adjustments in 1990 and 1991, BellSouthofficials said Sunday. The pact also provides for employees toreceive up to 12 months of child care leave and receive six monthsof medical coverage while on leave.   Three more of the so-called ``Baby Bells'' spawned by the 1984breakup of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph face strike deadlines atthe end of the week.   Contracts expire Saturday at Ameritech, US West and SouthwesternBell. Together, those companies employ 131,000 union workers in 24states.</TEXT></DOC>
