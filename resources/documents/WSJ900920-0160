Massachusetts voters, in an expression of voteralienation, selected the outspoken John Silber as theDemocratic nominee for governor.</LP><TEXT>   Oklahoma voters, by a large margin, approved a limit onstate lawmakers' tenure. The amendment, which takes effectJan. 1, will restrict legislators to 12 years in office.Those now in office will be allowed to serve 12 more years.   The upset triumph of Mr. Silber, who is on leave aspresident of Boston University, over former state AttorneyGeneral Francis Bellotti came as Massachusetts voters turnedaway politicians with ties to Gov. Michael Dukakis, the 1988Democratic presidential nominee. One of the losers inTuesday's primary balloting was Democratic Attorney GeneralJames Shannon.   Mr. Silber, a tough-talking Texan who came to symbolizeBay State resentment of the political establishment, willface former federal prosecutor William Weld, anotherpolitical outsider who pulled off an upset in the Republicangubernatorial primary. He defeated House Minority LeaderSteven Pierce.   The Massachusetts results were a rebuke to what candidatesin both parties called &quot;politics-as-usual&quot; and brought to anend an era dominated by Mr. Dukakis, who served three termsas governor. In the face of mounting criticism and burgeoningbudget deficits, he declined to seek another term.   &quot;The choice is between leadership proven by experience ormore of the same,&quot; Mr. Silber said at his victory party.&quot;Have you had enough? I think you have. Then join me intaking back our government.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
