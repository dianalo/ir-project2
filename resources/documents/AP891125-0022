News that his predecessor, Milos Jakes, had resigned brought athrong of people into the streets of Prague in a spontaneousexplosion of joy.   Reaction to the choice of Urbanek, however, was reserved.   Urbanek, 48, joined the old 13-man Politburo 13 months ago.   Since then, according to a senior Western diplomat, Urbanek hasspent much of his time traveling in the provinces and apparentlyhas gained support from regional party chiefs.   His most recent responsibilities as head of a new council forthe party in the Czech republic should have given him clear insightinto the state of the economy and the party's standing in Bohemiaand his native Moravia.   Urbanek's greatest asset is his relative obscurity. UnderCommunist Party custom, the general secretary must come fromPolitburo ranks.   Of the 13 men available, Urbanek was one of the few not directlyassociated with the unpopular hard-line policies in place since1968, and thus has a chance to restore the party's flaggingstanding.   The official CTK news agency said Urbanek was elected generalsecretary in a secret ballot of the Central Committee, with 136votes for and seven against. It was not known if there were anyabstentions.   What little is known of Urbanek suggests that in the past he hasbeen an orthodox Communist.   In an article in the party weekly Tribuna in March, Urbanek tookthe standard line of acknowledging shortcomings in the presentsystem but excluding independent groups from dialogue.   He wrote that prominent dissidents ``are not concerned withdemocracy, freedom and the environment, with dialogue in the realmof Socialism, but with a return to capitalism with all theconsequences this would have for our country.   ``It is therefore impossible to give in to them,'' he wrote.   Born March 22, 1941, at Bojkovice in south Moravia to a peasantfamily, Urbanek joined the Communist Party in 1963, studied at anindustrial school and joined Czechoslovak railways as a stationmaster in his hometown in 1970.   In 1973, he became part of the regional Communist Partycommittee in south Moravia while studying part-time at the party'sinstitute in Prague.   By 1982, he had risen to head the Communist Party in Brno, thecapital of Moravia and Czechoslovakia's third-largest city.   In March 1988, he made it onto the influential Central Committeeapparatus.   Seven months later, he vaulted on to the ruling party Politburoin a reshuffle that saw four other men named to the ruling body.   At the same time, he was made head of the newly createdCommittee for Party Work in the Czech Republic, which until thenhad not had its own Communist Party organization _ something thatexisted in Slovakia since 1969. He also was named head of a CentralCommittee commission for the political system in Czechoslovakia.   Other details of his personal life were not known.</TEXT></DOC>
