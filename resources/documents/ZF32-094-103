(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Most 1-2-3 users are comfortable using add-ins to transform theirspreadsheets into accounting systems, desktop publishers, or database frontends.andP;  Now, Beyond Inc. is turning 1-2-3 into something new: anelectronic-mail program.andM;Beyond's @Mail add-in lets you use 1-2-3 as a door into your company's Emailsystem.andP;  Without leaving 1-2-3, you can send and receive messages withworksheet files attached, and @Mail makes it easy to import ranges from yourworksheet into the text of the message.andM;Don't rule out @Mail even if your company already has E-mail or you're notsure you need a mail system.andP;  People already linked to an E-mail system canjoin 1-2-3 to that system with @Mail.andP;  Networked organizations that don'thave E-mail will find that @Mail is full-featured enough to meet their basicneeds, although the add-in is no match for top standalone packages, such ascc:Mail or Microsoft PC Mail.andM;What's easy for the user can be tricky for the network administrator,however.andP;  The difficulty of joining @Mail to an E-mail system depends on yourE-mail package.andP;  If you use Microsoft Windows, Quarterdeck Office Systems'Desqview, or a similar task switcher, you may be able to duplicate some of@Mail's benefits by cutting and pasting information between worksheets andmail messages.andP;  In either case, check with your network administrator beforemaking any decisions.andM;Covering the E-Mail BasicsandM;@Mail does a surprisingly good job of supplying the basic ingredients of anE-mail system.andP;  The add-in can even serve as a low-cost, low-impact way toimplement electronic mail on networks where everyone, by happy coincidence,uses 1-2-3.andP;  Depending on the number of @Mail licenses you purchase, per-usercosts are about $40 to $80.andM;@Mail lets you attach up to 64 files to one message, which makes it perfectfor exchanging worksheets and other files.andP;  You can highlight ranges fromyour worksheet and include them in the body of the message.andP;  For example, tosend several colleagues a cash flow projection produced with 1-2-3, you needonly retrieve the cash flow worksheet before you create the message.andM;You can also use 1-2-3 and @Mail together to ease some messaging tasks.andP;  Forexample, 1-2-3's list-management features can be used to address messages.andO;Suppose that you need to send a message to every employee in your company;sengineering department.andP;  If you keep an employee list in 1-2-3, you can sortit by department and then use the range that consists ofengineering-department members to create the address list for your message.andM;Because @Mail is a 1-2-3 add-in, you can create macro-driven spreadsheetapplications that communicate with the outside world, a capability that canbe quite useful under the right circumstances.andP;  Perhaps you need to sendsales reports to each of your company's field sales offices.andP;  Each reportmust show the sales totals for a particular office's territory.andP;  Good macrowriters can completely automate this process by first composing routines in1-2-3 to build a report for each territory, and then invoking @Mail to routethe reports electronically to the appropriate field sales office.andM;By using 1-2-3's analytical powers and @Mail's communications capability, youcan create an application that sends electronic notification whenever acertain condition in met.andP;  Suppose you use 1-2-3 to manage inventory for achain of small retail shops and you need to make sure that best-selling itemsare restocked on a timely basis.andP;  You could build a worksheet that tracksinventory levels at each shop.andP;  When a particular item falls below a certainstock level, the macro that controls the worksheet would automatically invoke@Mail and send a reorder request to the home office.andM;A chapter of the @Mail manual is devoted to writing macros that work withmessages, and its useful examples can serve as a good starting point for yourefforts.andM;Strengths and WeaknessesandM;Like the traditional interoffice memo, @Mail messages have three types ofrecipients: those to whom the message is addressed; those who get copies; andthose who receive blind copies (blind-copy recipients aren't shown on theaddressee list).andP;  You can mark your message as low, medium, or high priorityand request a return receipt.andP;  Like most E-mail programs, @Mail provides anuncomplicated editor for preparing the text of your messages.andM;So much for the basics.andP;  You won't confuse @Mail with a full-blown E-mailsystem because it lacks some of the niceties that are standard in suchsystems.andP;  For example, many E-mail programs provide electronic folders forfiling received messages.andP;  In @Mail, your only options are to keep themessage in your in-box, print it, or save it as a text file.andM;@Mail has no centrally administered name directory.andP;  Instead, it has apersonal &quot;address book&quot; with a limit of 400 entries, which each user mustmaintain.andP;  There is a back-door way for administrators to maintain addressbooks, but on an E-mail system with thousands of users, @Mail's small-scalename directory may not be adequate.andM;@Mail does offer two ground-breaking features that other systems would bewise to include: password protection for messages, and a new way to sharefiles, called virtual attachments.andP;  If you need to refer five of yourcoworkers to the same file, simply reference the file in the text of yourmessage, instead of attaching the file to the message and replicating it infive separate in-boxes.andP;  Coworkers can either retrieve the file (if it's aworksheet) or view it (if it's an ASCII file).andP;  Virtual attachments work onlyif all message recipients access the same server.andM;Will It Work?andM;Although the potential of @Mail and 1-2-3 is limited only by your creativity,your ability to implement @Mail may be limited by something over which youhave much less control: your company's network and E-mail environment.andM;@Mail uses Novell's Message Handling Service (MHS) to route its messages, andit is a fairly simple task to add @Mail to an existing MHS-compliant system,such as DaVinci Systems' DaVinci Mail or Actioin Technologies' TheCoordinator.andP;  But a majority of today's popular E-mail packages--includingsuch market leaders as cc:Mail, PC Mail (formerly The Network Courier), andWordPerfect Office--do not use MHS for internal message routing.andM;Because MHS is a widely accepted standard for connecting dissimilar systems,virtually all E-mail and communications environments can be linked to it,including those mentioned above, as well as such host-based and public mailsystems as IBM's Profs, DEC;s All-In-One, and MCI Mail.andM;To establish this kind of link, however, you need special MHS gatewaysoftware and a PC on which to run it.andP;  To be safe, consult the person whomanages your company's E-mail to make sure a link between your current systemand @Mail is feasible.andP;  Beyond has not yet announced plans to directlysupport other E-mail systems.andM;If you decide to use @Mail as your only E-mail system, you need to acquireand install MHS on your network.andP;  Use a version of MHS called MHS Standaloneif you all in from remote locations via modem.andM;@Mail works with 1-2-3 Releases 2, 2.2, and 2.3 and with Symphony.andP;  Therequired 120K of RAM is not a trivial sacrifice.andP;  If your PC does not haveexpanded memory, 120K could easily represent about a third of your availableworksheet memory.andM;However, you need to keep @Mail loaded only while you work with messages.andO;You can quickly unload it to work with a large worksheet.andM;IntegrationandM;@Mail fills one of two roles.andP;  It can serve as 1-2-3's pipeline to yourexisting E-mail system, provided you have the right ingredients to make thelink.andP;  Or it can become your one-and-only E-mail system when you share a1-2-3 network.andP;  In either case, @Mail's tight integration with 1-2-3 opens upa world of possibilities.andP;  With @Mail, no spreadsheet need be an island.andM;Bill Lawrence is a network engineer for a major western utility and afrequent contributor to LOTUS.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
