But a McDonnell Douglas official said Boeing just wants toburden the proposed transaction with U.S. governmentinterference so that the deal will die.</LP><TEXT>   In testimony prepared for a hearing today by thetechnology and national security subcommittee of the JointEconomic Committee, Larry Clarkson, Boeing's vice presidentfor planning and international development, warned that&quot;Boeing and America have much to lose if an Asian Airbus isallowed to enter the marketplace.&quot;   He maintained that the company didn't oppose the conceptof an investment by Taiwan. Still, in an interview yesterday,the executive said Boeing wants a novel bilateral agreementbetween the U.S. and Taiwan, or other legal constraints toensure that McDonnell Douglas won't get subsidization fromthe Taiwan government after the company sells 40% of itscommercial-aircraft operation to Taiwan Aerospace for $2billion, as proposed. The Taiwan concern is 29%government-owned. Another 9% of Douglas's jet business couldbe sold to other Asian countries.   With the big Singapore air show as a backdrop, McDonnellDouglas officials were signaling this week that completion ofthe Taiwan transaction could drag on far beyond what wasinitially expected when the agreement was signed lastNovember. Originally predicted for Jan. 31, the signing nowis being delayed until a longer review by Taiwan officials. AMcDonnell Douglas spokesman said only that the signing is duebefore the end of the year, and didn't dispute that it couldcome late in 1992.   Delays could encourage more criticism of theairplane-building arrangement on both sides of the Pacific.McDonnell Douglas labor groups have challenged it forlocating manufacturing outside the U.S., and Taiwan officialshave expressed concern about the risks associated with thelarge investment.   Boeing's criticism of the McDonnell Douglas-Taiwanproposal isn't surprising, given that Boeing's leadership inthe world airliner business makes it the main target for thenew Asian venture. The new MD-12 jetliner McDonnell Douglasand Taiwan Aerospace propose building together would competeboth with Boeing's 747 jumbo jet and its new 777 model. Andfor years, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas each have complainedthat the European Airbus Industrie consortium competesunfairly with U.S. companies through government subsidies.Boeing says subsidies to Airbus, the world's second-largestjetmaker, now average $8 million per aircraft.   McDonnell Douglas Chairman John McDonnell has said anyinvestment by Taiwan Aerospace will be &quot;subject to thedisciplines of the market&quot; and thus isn't unfair.   Until now, Boeing has been reluctant to press its concernsbefore Congress, but Mr. Clarkson said new information aboutthe Taiwan plan has disturbed the company. &quot;That's really whywe're turning the heat up,&quot; said Mr. Clarkson. &quot;We want to besure it gets good visibility and the people who need to thinkabout it do think about it.&quot;   Mr. Clarkson noted reports that Taiwan had $82 billion offoreign currency reserves that could provide a &quot;bankroll&quot; fora new aerospace industry. He said public statements fromTaiwan officials suggest that nation is willing to use muchmore government money to support the venture in the future.He recommended that the U.S. government &quot;examine the sourcesof funds&quot; in the Taiwan venture, require McDonnell Douglasand Taiwan to pledge not to artificially induce sales, andcreate a mechanism to allow monitoring of the venture'soperations.   But McDonnell Douglas's chief of commercial-airlinerproduction, John Wolf, said Boeing &quot;is clearly turning up thepressure to do what they can in my mind to prevent thistransaction.&quot; Mr. Wolf, who also is scheduled to testify heretoday, said the venture &quot;represents the only real competitionthey have had for a significant portion of their business.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
