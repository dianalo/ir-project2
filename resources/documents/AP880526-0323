Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jai ordered a crackdown on violentprotests and radicals, but the mandate seemed to have little effecton the wave of anti-American rage.   About 30 students dashed out of sidestreets and hurled rocks andfirebombs at a branch in southern Seoul of the KorAm Bank, policesaid. Police said four people were arrested.   The bank, a joint venture between the Bank of America and Koreanbusiness groups, was not damaged. It had not yet opened forbusiness and had shutters over the windows and entrance.   Riot police fired tear gas in front of the National Assemblybuilding in Seoul to disperse farmers protesting plans to increaseimports of U.S. agricultural products.   At least five people were injured.   About 500 farmers, with two calves at the front, hurled cow dungand clashed with police after a rally attended by about 1,500farmers. Police kicked and punched the protesters, who shouted``Oppose American beef and its pressure to open the Korean market!''   One calf ran amok through 1,000 riot police surrounding theassembly compound.   The United States is pushing South Korea to widen its markets toAmerican imports. The trade issue has fanned anti-U.S. sentiment.   The attack on the bank was the first on U.S. business interestsin the wave of violent protests that have been aimed mainly at theUnited States.   A senior government official said Wednesday that theanti-American sentiment of the radical students is not shared bymost Koreans.   Hyun Hong-choo, minister of legislation, said: ``We areconfident the majority of the people are happy with our relationswith the United States.'' He was commenting at a lunch with thepress about the recent unrest.   Radical students blame the United States for the partition ofthe Korean peninsula and accuse Washington of supporting militaryrule in the South. They demand the withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S.troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.   The Korean peninsula was divided by U.S. and Soviet troops thatended the Japanese occupation in 1945 at the end of World War II.   Last week, protesters hurling rocks and firebombs attacked U.S.cultural centers in Seoul and in the southern city of Kwangju andhurled homemade bombs at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul.   Dissidents said Thursday they would continue the anti-U.S.campaign and called a major anti-U.S. rally in Seoul on Friday tomark the end of the eighth anniversary of a 1980 civil uprising inKwangju, where thousands of students and citizens battled police indaily protests.   Dissidents contend the United States condoned the South Koreanarmy's bloody suppression of the nine-day uprising, in which atleast 191 people were killed.   A 20-year-old student who had called for a full probe of theKwangju uprising died in a hospital Thursday after dousing himselfwith kerosene and setting himself afire during a campus rally May18.   About 400 students shouting anti-U.S. and anti-governmentslogans staged a sit-in protest at the hospital in Seoul where ChoiDuk-soo died. Choi was a student at Dankook University.   In South Korea, suicide is sometimes used as a form of protest.   In a Cabinet meeting, Lee called for a crackdown againstradicals and tighter security around foreign facilities.   Lee said the recent protests posed a threat to the people and``inflicted undesirable influence on the nation's security anddiplomacy before staging the Olympics.''   The Olympic Games open in Seoul in September.</TEXT></DOC>
