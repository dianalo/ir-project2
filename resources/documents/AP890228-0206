The Commerce Department said the gross national product, thebroadest measure of economic health, advanced at its slowest pacesince the final three months of 1986. It grew 3.8 percent in all of1988.   The slowdown in growth was accompanied by a pickup in oneinflation measure. The GNP deflator, which measures a changingmarketbasket of goods, rose at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in thelast quarter of the year. That contrasted to an increase for all of1988 of just 3.4 percent.   The Federal Reserve last week launched another round ofcredit-tightening in an attempt to get inflation under control.   However, critics contend that given the sluggish growth of theeconomy, the higher interest rates are likely to topple the countryinto a recession.   The GNP estimate of 2 percent for the fourth quarter wasunchanged from a report issued one month ago, but the overall numbermasked a number of cross-currents in different sectors of theeconomy.   Consumer spending, propelled by a hefty jump in spending forbig-ticket items such as cars, rose by 3.5 percent in the finalthree months of the year, almost one full percentage point above theprevious estimate.   But this increase was offset by a quarterly trade deficit $9.4billion higher than the July-September period as a 7.7 percent jumpin exports was swamped 13 percent rise in imports.   It marked the second consecutive quarterly widening of the tradedeficit, heightening fears that improvements in the trade gap havestalled out.   For the year, the GNP rose by 3.8 percent, the best annualperformance since a 6.8 percent rise in 1984. The annual figure wasunchanged from the initial estimate last month.   For 1989, the Bush administration is counting on strong economicgrowth of 3.2 percent to generate higher government revenues andhelp to reduce the budget deficit without the need for a taxincrease.   However, many private forecasters are looking for a much smallerGNP increase this year and higher interest rates, because of theFederal Reserve Board's inflation-fighting efforts.   Those factors could well doom the Bush administration's hopes ofdriving the budget deficit below $100 billion.   The 2 percent GNP increase for the fourth quarter followed a 2.5percent third-quarter rise and was the slowest quarterly increasesince a 1.4 percent rate in the final three months of 1986.   The fourth quarter figure was depressed by the lingering effectsof last summer's severe drought. Without the drought effects, theeconomy would have expanded at a faster 3.1 percent rate.   The 5.3 percent rise in the GNP deflator, which measures changingconsumption patterns, followed a third-quarter increase of 4.7percent. In the second quarter last year, prices shot up at a 5.5percent rate.   There have been a rash of reports in recent weeks showinginflation is picking up momentum, including government estimatesthat both wholesale and retail prices climbed sharply in January.   Those reports triggered the Federal Reserve last week to tightenup further on credit, including a boost last Friday in the discountlending rate for financial institutions, the most dramatic signalthe Fed can send of its intentions to push interest rates higher.   The central bank is attempting to engineer a ``soft landing'' inwhich growth slows enough to control inflation but the economy doesnot weaken so much that the country heads into a recession.   Some economists said they were doubtful that the central bankwould succeed.   ``We think the odds are moving towards a recession,'' said DavidWyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass.,forecasting firm. ``We are getting to a dangerous stage of theeconomic cycle. The Fed is trying to slow things down and it is veryeasy for the Fed to overdo it.''   Wyss, however, said his firm still was not forecasting arecession, predicting instead that the GNP will expand by 2.6percent this year.   That would be down from a 3.8 percent GNP growth rate for all of1988, the best performance since the economy surged ahead at a 6.8percent pace in 1984.   The Bush administration has based its first budget on anassumption that the economy will expand by 3.2 percent this year.While the higher growth makes it easier on paper for President Bushto lower the budget deficit without raising taxes, many privateeconomists scoff at the administration's forecast.   They have also accused the administration of using unrealisticinterest rate projections, especially in light of the drive by theFed to tighten credit in an effort to slow borrowing demands.   The National Association of Business Economists released a newquarterly survey on Monday which pegged 1990 as the most likely yearthe next recession will start.   The economists for some of the country's largest corporationspredicted that economic growth for 1989 will slow to an annual rateof 2.7 percent but only one in five expected a recession to beginthis year. But 73 percent of the analysts said the economy will bein the soup by the end of 1990.   ``The business economists feel that this expansion is not at theend of its string yet. We probably have another year or so to go,''said Jay Woodworth, senior domestic economist for Bankers Trust Co.of New York.</TEXT></DOC>
