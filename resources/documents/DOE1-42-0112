In recent tests conducted in South Leicester,England, diamond picks on a trepanning machine cut 20,000m in nine monthsin a seam 1.5m thick. Although diamond picks are relatively expensiveabout 150 dollars each, pick cost for production was only 7.7 cents/mone third less than that of carbide picks used to cut the same distanceof seam. Total pick cost saving for 20,000 m operation was about 770dollars with higher productivity through reduction in machine down time.</TEXT></DOC>
