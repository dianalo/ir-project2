YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   Banking regulators had found skeletons in the closets of failed banks before, but nothing quite like what they discovered a few weeks ago in Booker, Texas.    When Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. officials went to the small town in December to close First Bank andamp; Trust Co., they counted cash, reviewed records and inventoried other assets. Eventually, someone noticed a Styrofoam cooler in the trust department.    Inside, the officials discovered a human skull and other human bones.    The cooler and its contents had arrived last October, from the basement of a house belonging to a doctor who had died. They were turned over to the bank because it was handling the doctor's estate.    In the past, FDIC liquidators have come across such failed-bank assets as a sunken tugboat, a goat dairy farm, an X-rated movie and a thoroughbred stud with a venereal disease. Most of the items were repossessed collateral on bad loans. But the bones had officials rattled.    The plot thickened when Lipscomb County Sheriff Calvin Babitzke, finding that the marrow was still soft in at least one of the bones, asked the FDIC to turn them over for a possible criminal investigation. The FDIC, mindful of its fiduciary responsibilities as receiver of the failed bank's holdings, first drafted a court order for the sheriff, ordering the agency to &quot;surrender possession and control of any and all . . . bones and such other parts of the human body and anatomy found&quot; in the bank.    Meanwhile, because the FDIC had received no bids to buy First Bank andamp; Trust, the agency arranged to transfer the bank's $76.6 million in insured deposits to First National Bank of Perryton (Texas), which also bought the defunct bank's good loans, for $29 million.    The FDIC kept the bad loans, but Larry Vickery, the closing team's attorney, wants nothing further to do with the closed bank's osseous assets. &quot;We won't take them back without a court order,&quot; he says.    If the sheriff tries to return the bones, Mr. Vickery wrote in a memorandum, the agency should &quot;vigorously contest such an action because old-bone appraisers are in short supply, bones are difficult to dispose of both from a marketing and legal point of view and these bones in particular have proven to be a pain in the lower anatomy to the closing team's legal staff.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
