Dewey Warren Holdings PLC, a small British insurance company in which Mr. Holmes a Court's Bell Group International Ltd. holds a 42% stake, announced Friday that it had boosted its Morgan Grenfell stake to 5.19% from less than 1%. Dewey Warren said its purchase of 6,699,000 shares raised its stake to 7,849,000 shares.    Banking-industry sources said Dewey Warren bought the shares last week from the Kuwait Investment Office, an investment agency of the Kuwaiti government, at 500 pence ($8.15) apiece. At that price, the stake has an indicated value of #33.5 million ($54.6 million), giving Dewey Warren's overall holding a value of #39.3 million. Kuwait Investment Office officials weren't available for comment Friday.    Morgan Grenfell shares jumped 53 pence, to 540 pence, on London's stock exchange Friday.    Mr. Holmes a Court's share purchases mark the latest sign that Morgan Grenfell might be vulnerable to a takeover bid. Last week, Morgan Grenfell confirmed that Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a unit of American Express Co., had acquired 2.7% of the merchant bank last January. That disclosure added to analysts' speculation about a possible takeover of the merchant bank, which has been buffeted by share-trading scandals recently.    Morgan Grenfell declined to comment on Friday's announcement. But privately, insiders acknowledged that the Dewey Warren holding doesn't represent a friendly stake. Banking-industry sources think Mr. Holmes a Court is more likely to hold the shares to see if another bidder emerges than to launch a full-fledged takeover effort himself. &quot;It looks like a classic bit of arbitrage,&quot; said an individual with close ties to Morgan Grenfell.    Other banking-industry experts speculated that the Australian financier's purchase might be aimed at enticing Deutsche Bank AG, which holds a 4.9% Morgan Grenfell stake, to bid for the rest of the bank. Such a strategy would resemble recent developments at Hill Samuel Group PLC. Earlier this month, the British merchant bank began discussing a merger with Zurich-based Union Bank of Switzerland after Mr. Holmes a Court, the Australian financier Larry Adler and the Australian businessman Kerry Packer had amassed separate stakes totaling 28%.    In Frankfurt, West Germany, Deutsche Bank dismissed the speculation. At the annual meeting in May, the bank's co-chairman, Alfred Herrhausen, denied that Deutsche Bank had any intention of increasing its 4.9% Morgan Grenfell stake.    Hostile bidders for Morgan Grenfell might face some obstacles, however. There are other major holders besides Deutsche Bank. The British insurer Willis Faber PLC holds a 20.8% stake in Morgan Grenfell and is considered friendly to management, a Morgan Grenfell official said. He said other major holders include Britain's Prudential Corp., with a 6.5% interest.    Whatever develops, last week's purchase will heighten attention on Mr. Holmes a Court's growing role as a power broker in the City, London's financial district, and abroad. In recent weeks, he has emerged as a major player in at least three banking groups here. Besides his stakes in Morgan Grenfell and Hill Samuel, he also holds slightly less than 15% of Standard Chartered PLC, and last week the commercial bank named him a group deputy chairman.    In addition, Mr. Holmes a Court said last week that he intended to boost his stake in Texaco Inc. to more than 10% from the 9.6% he already controls.    Mr. Holmes a Court wasn't available for comment. Alan Newman, chairman of Dewey Warren, didn't return phone calls Friday.    Separately, Dewey Warren said it would acquire the insurance-broking activities of Hogg Robinson Group PLC for #116 million ($189.1 million). But that acquisition depends on the success of TSB Group PLC's #282 million bid for Hogg Robinson, a British insurance and financial company. Late Friday, Hogg Robinson rejected the offer from TSB, a British financial-services company, as &quot;totally inadequate and unacceptable.&quot;    ---   Dispute Over Guinness Fees   LONDON -- Thomas Ward, a former outside director of Guinness PLC, probably will appeal a court ruling that he must return #5.2 million ($8.3 million) in fees illegally received from the British brewing and liquor concern, his lawyer said.    If an appeal fails, attorney Simon Easton said, Mr. Ward would press his counterclaim for fees covering consulting that he contends he did during Guinness's #2.53 billion ($4.05 billion) takeover of Distillers Co. last year.    Vice Chancellor Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson ruled Friday in Britain's High Court that the contested secret payment was illegal because Mr. Ward should have disclosed it to the full Guinness board.    According to Guinness's court statements, former Guinness Chairman Ernest Saunders authorized the #5.2 million payment and former Director Olivier Roux paid it to a Jersey-based company, Marketing andamp; Acquisition Consultants Ltd., at Mr. Ward's request.    Guinness also said in court that Mr. Ward told Mr. Roux the payment was for &quot;research into Distillers's U.S. wholesale network.&quot; Mr. Ward's lawyers told the court that Mr. Saunders agreed to pay the fee to induce him to stay in Britain and help plan strategy during the heat of the battle for Distillers. </TEXT></DOC>
