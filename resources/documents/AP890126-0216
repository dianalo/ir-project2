(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dennis wears an electronic band around hisankle, a constant reminder of his criminal record. For the privilegeof wearing it and being at home instead of in prison, he surrendershalf his paycheck.   When he leaves the house and feels a fresh breeze, and watches itrustle the leaves on trees, Dennis figures he's got a pretty gooddeal.   ``It's better than being in prison. I pay and I leave for homeand then I can see the trees and it's worth it. It's just part of menow.''   If trends continue, there will be twice as many offenders in theUnited States being monitored with electronic tethers this year asthe 2,300 a day in a February 1988 National Institute of Justicesurvey, said David Dillingham of the National Institute ofCorrections, part of the Justice Department.   A December survey of manufacturers revealed that since the firsttest of the tethers in 1983 in Albuquerque, N.M., some 11,000 havebeen shipped, said Marc Renzema, a Kutztown (Pa.) Universitycriminal justice professor who publishes the newsletter ``OffenderMonitoring.''   Michigan has 1,100 people in its program, more than any otherstate, said Richard Brummer, a vice president of B.I. Inc. ofBoulder, Colo., the largest of 11 producers of house arrest devices.Florida, with 650, is No. 2.   The tethers _ smaller than a cigarette pack and less than 5ounces _ have replaced Michigan's extended furlough program, inwhich convicts were released and told they had to stay home when notat work or school. That hasn't changed; what has changed is thatthose rules now can be enforced.   ``There wasn't the staff and manpower to call somebody repeatedlyseven days a week. Now we know to the minute when somebody's comingand going,'' said Laura Young, supervisor for one of the state'sthree monitoring centers.   ``If someone's curfew is 8 p.m., we're taking steps by 8:10 p.m.if they're not home yet. Before it just wasn't done. A person couldbe gone for seven days. Now, for inmates, at four hours, if we can'tlocate them they go in the Law Enforcement Information Networkcomputer system as an escapee.''   The typical participant was convicted of a property crime,behaved well in prison and has 15 to 18 months before eligibilityfor parole. Sex offenders, violent criminals, major drug dealers andcareer criminals are barred.   The tether is attached to an ankle by a plastic strap. Thewatertight unit is coded to a device attached to a phone in theinmate's home. If the signal is interrupted when the prisoner issupposed to be home, or if either device is tampered with, thetransmitter sends a message to the monitoring center.   About 3 percent of the tethered inmates in Michigan have escapedand fewer than 2 percent have become repeat felons.   ``It will never be as secure as a jail cell. We don't nail thefront door shut,'' said Brummer, whose company services 60jurisdictions in 30 states.   In Florida, the anklets _ or less restrictive wristlets andpagers _ are used as a punishment somewhere between prison andprobation, said corrections department spokesman Bob Macmaster.   In Michigan, about $4.9 million has been budgeted for the programthis year, but the corrections department expects to collect $1.8million in fees from prisoners. The daily cost of phones andequipment averages $6 per inmate. Working participants must turnover half their salaries, not to exceed the cost to the state. Theaverage daily reimbursement per inmate in 1988 was $3.20.   The state estimates that's about half the cost of a day in jailor prison.   In addition to easing prison crowding, the tether program givesconvicts a chance at a head start on an education or trainingprogram, as well as allowing them to earn money and live with family.   Dennis, who asked that his last name not be published, servedtime for breaking and entering. He lives with his parents whilestudying electronics and working as a security guard, and must wearthe tether until he is eligible for parole in May 1990.   ``It doesn't discourage me. Time is not standing still, it'sgoing forward,'' he said. ``This kind of keeps me in line, it helpsme remember. This is my friend.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for PMs, Jan. 30</NOTE></DOC>
