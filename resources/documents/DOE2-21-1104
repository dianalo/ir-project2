<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-21-1104 </DOCNO><TEXT>Methods and data concerning the morphological and microstructural characterizationsof the surface of a polypropylene copolymer (PP-PE) are presented: samplesof this polymer were moulded under different temperature conditions;some were subjected to UV irradiation in conditioning chambers such asthe Xenotest apparatus. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) gives picturesof a surface morphologies before and after irradiation and shows theemergence of microcracks resulting from polymer photodegradation. Methodssuch as mercury microporosimetry provide quantitative analyses of thesecracks. Selective surface etching of samples reveals crystalline areasin the microstructure of the polymer. Infrared (attenuated total reflection)spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction permit determining the crystallinityratios of the samples before and after degradation.</TEXT></DOC>
