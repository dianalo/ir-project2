The utility holding company also announced on that day$250 million in one-time charges on the petroleum and retailoperations that it put on the block, and a big fourth-quarterloss.</LP><TEXT>   The bad news was preceded by an unusually high volume oftrading in Pacific Enterprises financial instruments. The dayafter the announcement, the stock's price plunged 24% onvolume of nearly 3.2 million shares. Two leading New Yorkrating agencies downgraded their ratings on PacificEnterprises' short-term debt and on some or all of itspreferred stock.   &quot;It appears that some people may have used insideinformation they had received prior to the announcement tospeculate in PE's stock,&quot; said the letter from Willis B. WoodJr., president and chief executive officer, who remindedemployees that they and family members aren't allowed totrade on insider information and that doing so can lead todischarge or criminal and civil penalties. The letter alsowas sent to Pacific Enterprises directors, who it said arebound by the same strictures.   The letter said that &quot;preliminarily, we have determinedthat an unusual number of individuals, some of whom werereportedly employees, traded in company stock through puts,calls, short sales or options&quot; before the announcement. Mr.Wood said that anyone trading in the company's stock thisyear was to have notified the company's general counsel, LesLoBaugh, by last Wednesday. He added: &quot;It can be assumed thatthe Securities and Exchange Commission will be making thesame review.&quot;   Company spokesmen couldn't be reached over the weekend tocomment on the letter, which was obtained by The Wall StreetJournal. But a company spokesman told the Los Angeles Timesthat it has banned since at least 1986 employees from tradingin puts, calls, options or rights to purchase or sell PacificEnterprises stock. That newspaper cited American StockExchange figures indicating that Pacific Enterprisesput-options stock averaged 32 transactions a day in the fourweeks before the Feb. 4 announcement. But on Feb. 3, 297 suchput contracts were made, it said.</TEXT></DOC>
