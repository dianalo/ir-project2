PAUL, Minn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Northwest Airlines said it plans to trim its work force by 1.9%, mostly through layoffs.    The NWA Inc. unit, which has 34,427 employees, said the work-force reduction of 646 is part of a larger cost-cutting effort to compete more effectively with nonunion carriers. A company spokesman said the airline has already cut costs by improving its hub facilities and computer systems. Also, by June 1 the airline will have reduced the number of its departures by 55 flights, to 1,533.    None of the work-force reductions, some of which will be accomplished through attrition, involves pilots or flight attendants, the spokesman said. He added that no further staff reductions are planned.    The staff reduction comes on the heels of a first-quarter loss of $35 million that NWA posted last week. The company cited expenses related to its acquisition of Republic Airlines last August. In the 1986 first quarter, NWA had a $16.4 million deficit. Revenue rose 83% to $1.17 billion from $638.4 million a year earlier, primarily because of the addition of Republic.    Separately, Northwest said its April traffic jumped 95.4% to 3.5 billion revenue passenger miles from 1.79 billion miles in April 1986. The year-earlier figures don't reflect Northwest's acquisition of Republic. A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one mile.    Northwest's April traffic increased 24.5%, when compared with the results of Northwest and Republic operating separately in April 1986. The airline's April load factor, or the percentage of available seats occupied, increased to 65.7% from 57.5%; the load factor for the two airlines operating separately a year earlier was 58.5%.    For the first four months of the year, Northwest's traffic increased 83.1% to 12.66 billion revenue passenger miles from 6.91 billion miles a year earlier, prior to the Republic acquisition. The airline's load factor increased to 61.7% from 57%. </TEXT></DOC>
