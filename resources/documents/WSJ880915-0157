They believe government bond trading, like a Wagner opera, is best performed at home.    Economic heavyweight West Germany boasts a roughly $140 billion government bond market, surpassed only by the U.S., Japan and the U.K. But unlike those countries, Germany never has had a futures or options market for its bonds.    This month, the London International Financial Futures Exchange fills the gap by offering the first German bund, or government bond, futures contract. Bankers and traders in Europe say the long-overdue step will increase the marketability of German government securities world-wide. For the first time, investment funds, banks and other big investors will be able to hedge their German bond portfolios against interest rate and exchange rate movements. That ability to control risk makes the bonds more alluring.    LIFFE will become the only market in which investors can trade the four major government debt futures contracts -- American, Japanese, British and German -- exchange officials say. For U.S. investors, trading and hedging government debt futures portfolios should become faster and more efficient because all contracts will be traded simultaneously on LIFFE's floor.    The additional liquidity and depth in the German debt market generated by the futures trading will boost the international financial clout of the Bundesbank, dealers say. The new market also will give Germany's central bank additional levers to regulate the domestic bond market. And it should heighten the mark's role as an international reserve currency.    But the riled German financial executives threaten to boycott the London contract. They fear it will diminish Frankfurt's role as a European financial center and accelerate capital outflows from German domestic markets. &quot;The reaction in Germany is we should not be too enthusiastic about this project,&quot; says Ruediger von Rosen, executive vice chairman of the Federation of German Stock Exchanges in Frankfurt. &quot;LIFFE was quicker, faster and more clever. It shows how much we have to do to regain international competitiveness.&quot;    Among international investors, however, &quot;There is a lot of interest,&quot; says Neil Brown, head of financial futures sales at London-based Security Pacific Hoare Govett, one of 16 securities houses that will trade the contract. He predicts success because the contract offers &quot;added opportunity to manage risks efficiently.&quot;    The Germans can't start their own contract yet because a 19th century gambling law effectively makes futures and options transactions unenforceable in Germany. But LIFFE's launch has accelerated Germany's timetable to offer a rival product, underscoring how in an era of global markets, investor demand in the capital markets can have important effects on government policy.    Fearing potential loss of business to London, the German government has promised to rewrite the gambling law by 1990. A Bundesbank spokesman in Frankfurt says it isn't pleased the London market will be first to offer the bond contract. But the German central bank isn't trying to stymie the launch, either. That signal is prompting Germany's disparate securities industry -- spread among eight regional stock exchanges -- to bury rivalries and organize their own German futures and options market in time for repeal of the gambling law.    In July, 17 German banks announced plans for a German futures exchange to catch up to London. Organizers intend to offer government bond futures, stock-option and stock-index futures contracts. Meantime, Mr. von Rosen says the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which accounts for the bulk of daily bond dealing, plans to launch a continuous trading system for government issues next month. That will supplement the antiquated daily price fixing, which some dealers say constrains trading. </TEXT></DOC>
