But buried in LTV's quarterly financial statement released thispast week was an explosive accounting charge that grabbed theattention of many publicly owned companies that could face similarbalance-sheet shockers in the next few years.   LTV said it was putting $2.26 billion aside for what the companyanticipates will be its potential liability in health insurancecosts of 118,000 current and retired employees.   Under present accounting rules, companies aren't obligated toreport these estimated expenses or reserve money for them. They onlyhave to report retiree health insurance costs as they are incurred,on what is known as a ``pay as you go'' basis.   But the Financial Accounting Standards Board, thegovernment-sanctioned authority for accountants, is planning topropose a new rule in January that would require companies to showall retiree health insurance costs _ those incurred now and expectedin the future _ as a liability.   With medical costs soaring at an average rate of 20 percent ayear, the potential liability of U.S. corporations is staggering,with nothing in place to offset the expense.   The Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit organizationin Washington, has estimated that non-governmental employers owe atleast $168.7 billion in retiree health benefits, assuming medicalinflation eventually is brought under control.   More pessimistic forecasts put the potential liability at $2trillion to $3 trillion, said Deborah Shollet, an institute official.   None of this liability shows up in quarterly earnings statementsor annual reports to shareholders, as though it doesn't exist. Thatis the main reason why the accounting rule change was proposed.   ``These are big benefits; they represent big obligations,'' saidMichael Johnston, a partner at Hewitt Associates, a Chicago-basedbenefit consulting concern that has been advising clients on theimplications of the rule change. He said many corporate accountantsare concerned.   ``I think most companies are going to fight tooth and nailagainst this type of thing,'' Johnston said. ``It's accounting forfuture inflation, long before inflation comes into play, and it'sgoing to have such a big hit on earnings, so most corporations haveto argue against it.''   Many accounting experts saw LTV's move to anticipate the expensenow as part of its bankruptcy-court housecleaning, and some believedother companies would wait for the new accounting rule before doinganything.   ``If you're trying to come out of bankruptcy and come outstarting fresh, you don't want to do it with a $2.26 billionliability,'' said Diana Scott, project manager of the FinancialAccounting Standard Board's change on post-employment benefits, whois helping draft the new rule.   She said companies will have an opportunity to comment on therule after the board promulgates a draft in January. Public hearingswould follow and a final rule is expected in 1990.   ``Almost everybody will acknowledge there's a liability and itshould be recorded. The question is how to record it,'' Ms. Scottsaid.   The uncertainty raised by the accounting board's intentions, asdramatized by the LTV action, is likely to at least force somecompanies to start making contingency plans, benefit consultants say.   A few already are looking closely at how to minimize theirretiree health insurance exposure by restricting the amount of moneythey contribute or even eliminating such benefits entirely.   Such cutbacks could affect millions of employees. HewittAssociates has calculated that 86 percent of the 800 biggestcompanies provide medical coverage after age 65 and 92 percentprovide it before age 65.   ``It will be impossible for employers to provide the samebenefits they've been providing,'' said Richard S. Raskin, a NewYork-based consultant with the Wyatt Co., a largecompensation-benefits consulting firm.   ``I think the trend is to take a look at what the promise toemployees is, and make it limited and manageable,'' he said. ``It'sno longer a case of, `we're going to provide you with all sorts ofmedical benefits.'''   Some experts speculated that large, mature industries with hugeretiree populations, such as the steelmakers, automakers andutilities, will have the hardest time under the new rule. Vibrantyoung businesses with relatively few retirees won't feel the impactfor a while.   Nevertheless, all companies with retiree health plans could beequally affected as the baby-boom work force matures into retirementage early next century and the cost of such benefits escalates.   Ms. Scott said the accounting standards board has been working onthe proposed rule for a few years and realizes the enormouspressures it could create on corporate America's finances. For thatreason, she said, such a change would likely be phased in over aperiod of years.   ``We have this tremendous unfunded obligation right now,'' shesaid. ``To put that on the balance sheet would just be onerous. Werecognize that.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
