Laun said Monday.   ``The best insurance against (U.S.) trade protectionism is foryou to show us that your markets are as open as ours,'' Laun saidin a greeting to the 14th ``Buy American'' mission from Taiwan.   At a ceremony in Washington, members of the 45-member promotiongroup signed contracts to buy $160 million worth of American goods.It was the first stop of a three-week, 11-state tour expected tomake total purchases of at least $532 million.   The island's foreign trade chief told the gathering Taiwan wouldlike a free trade agreement with the United States like thosearranged with Canada and Israel.   Laun said the U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan was down by 37percent in the first half of 1988. Taiwan officials said theirtrade surplus for January to August this year was $6.4 billion,41.7 percent less than that during the same period of 1987.   Taiwan also has allowed its currency to gain 40 percent in valueagainst the U.S. dollar, making U.S. goods more attractivelypriced, but ``there is still a way to go,'' Laun said.   Taiwan has reduced tariffs on U.S. products from 28 percent to14 percent, but here too, ``there is still a way to go,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
