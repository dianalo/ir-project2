ScheierandM;For a small company or a division located far from corporate headquarters,finding PC training for users can be an expensive headache.andM;But relief may be no further away than the local community college.andM;A growing number of community colleges offer PC training tailored tocorporate users, and several customers say these schools offer high-qualitytraining at a bargain (see chart, Page 131).andM;David Dougherty, a vice president and consumer banking director for GreenwoodCounty at NCNB National Bank of South Carolina in Greenwood said the trainingwas outstanding.andP;  &quot;There's no question in my mind,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I just highlyrecommend it.&quot;andM;Over the past two years, Dougherty has sent 15 bank employees to PiedmontTechnical College in Greenwood for training in software includingWordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3 and Symphony, as well as a basic introduction toPCs.andM;Dougherty said his company has an in-house user training center, but it is afour-hour drive away -- too far to be of any use to his local employees.andP;  &quot;Wehave to look to outside vendors to meet that need, and the technical schoolhas a very comprehensive user [training] program,&quot; he said.andM;While he hasn't priced training courses at any outside vendors, Doughertysaid he is satisfied with the price of $100 per user for a 15-hour course.andM;He is also pleased with the school's flexibility.andP;  &quot;They will put on aprogram for me for as little as five participants,&quot; Dougherty said.andP;  Inaddition, the school developed a course in Lotus Symphony for his users, eventhough it wasn't in the curriculum.andM;&quot;We will tailor the course to their needs,&quot; said Jim Ridgill, a trainingspecialist at Piedmont Technical College.andP;  He estimates that the schooltrains 20 to 40 corporate users per month.andM;Marvin Moss, manager of quality assurance at Aston Press Fabrics Inc., aClinton, S.C., textile firm, has sent 25 to 30 users to Piedmont TechnicalCollege in the last five years.andP;  For $300, he said, the school trained sixAston employees and two employees from one of the firm's suppliers on agraphics package.andP;  &quot;To train 10 of our people on the outside would probablytake at least $100 per person,&quot; Moss added.andM;In the first half of this year, the city of Phoenix, Ariz., has sent 500 cityemployees to Gateway Community College in Phoenix for PC training, said TomFerguson, a research analyst with the city's information-systems department.andM;The city can provide training for about the same price as the college -- $12per eight-hour day of training -- but &quot;our classroom sits eight, at most,&quot;Ferguson said.andP;  The city has about 2,500 computer users, and &quot;at eight perclass, we couldn't keep up with the demand&quot; for training, he added.andM;A growing number of the nation's 1,200 community colleges offer PC trainingcourses aimed at corporate users, said Bill Reinhard, editor of theCommunity, Technical and Junior College Times in Washington.andP;  &quot;We know it'sgrowing because we hear about one or two [more community colleges offeringtraining courses] a week.&quot;andM;Anna Dickerson, president of 4th Dimension Learning Center, a private PCtraining firm in Woodbridge, Conn., recommended that before sending users fortraining at a community college, a PC manager ask about the qualifications ofthe instructors and whether the college offers telephone support once theuser goes back to work.andM;&quot;A community college can train 60 people to use WordPerfect, but if theproblem is more complex, you need somebody with a broader vision,&quot; said MitchWeisburgh, president of Personal Computer Learning Centers of America Inc., aprivate PC training firm in New York.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
