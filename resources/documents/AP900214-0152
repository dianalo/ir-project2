Gorbachev appealed Wednesdayfor legislative backing for a stronger presidency and said it wasvital to his reforms, but wary lawmakers refused to be stampededinto setting a timetable.   Once again, the 542-member Supreme Soviet proved itself a forceto be reckoned with in the new Soviet political game, which underGorbachev has shifted more from closed-door sessions of the Kremlinleadership to elected government bodies.   After a two-month break, the fledgling Soviet legislaturereconvened for the third time in its less than one-year history.Lawmakers approved a 22-item agenda to debate bills designed to putflesh on the skeleton of Gorbachev's economic and social reforms,including legalization of private property.   However, the Kremlin leadership's proposal to call an emergencysession of the Supreme Soviet's parent body, the Congress ofPeople's Deputies, to replace the office now held by Gorbachev witha stronger Western-style presidency met with raucous debate.   ``Unless democracy is strengthened and ensured by correspondingmechanisms, democracy will perish and we'll lose,'' Gorbachevangrily told his critics.   Otherwise, he said, the victors will be forces who want to``tighten the screws even tighter than they were earlier.''   More power for the presidency would strengthen Gorbachev'sgovernment powers while further weakening the Communist Partyapparatus that he is trying to reform.   Gorbachev would have two powerful instruments to implement hisprogram of ``perestroika'' _ the party apparatus and the reinforcedmachinery of government.   Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov, who flanked Gorbachevbeneath a gilded globe emblazoned with the hammer and sickle,recommended that lawmakers call the Congress into session Feb. 27to fortify the presidency and make other constitutional changes _including the planned abandonment of the Communist Party's legallyguaranteed right to govern.   A close Gorbachev adviser, Georgy Shaknazarov, told reportersduring a break in the proceedings that top Kremlin officials wantthe Congress to elect the new president within a month.   But the Supreme Soviet voted 304-95, with 34 abstentions, todebate the presidential issue first. If the Supreme Soviet approvesGorbachev's plan to fortify the presidency, it must then beconfirmed by the Congress of People's Deputies.   Gorbachev, the Soviet leader since March 1985, is likely to be acandidate for the new presidency, but for the second time in a weekhe spoke guardedly about whether he will run.   ``If we proceed to take a decision on the presidency, we willdecide that there will be alternative candidates,'' he said. ``Idon't know if I will be among the alternatives.''   Still, a half-dozen speakers Wednesday criticized the rush tocreate a more powerful presidency, and Gorbachev acknowledged thatsome Soviets equate him with late Romanian dictator NicolaeCeausescu. He did not clarify whether the comparison was being madeby reformers or by hard-liners who supported Ceausescu's brand ofiron-fisted leadership.   Ceausescu was ousted by a popular revolution and executed Dec.25.   Gorbachev told the legislature that he was once opposed topresidential power, but ``life has demanded changes.'' In theSoviet political system, the head of state has traditionally beenmerely a figurehead.   A prominent liberal lawmaker from Leningrad, Anatoly Sobchak,said that increasing the powers of the presidency would decreasethose of the legislature, and he opposed such a shift.   Ilmar Bisher of Latvia said he supported the stronger presidencybut only if the powers of the office are carefully tailored. Hesaid that couldn't be done in time to hold a session of the2,250-member Congress this month.   Another speaker said the people would consider it strange forthe Congress to elect a president now, since it elected Gorbachevto a five-year term as Supreme Soviet chairman _ sometimes termed``president'' for short _ only last spring and increased his powers.   In the corridors outside the Kremlin hall, a legislativeopposition, the Inter-regional Deputies Group, circulated apetition demanding that the president be directly elected by thepeople. It said voters should cast ballots in secret and have achoice of candidates from several parties.   The petition, read on the floor of the Supreme Soviet by groupmember Sergei Stankevich, also called for the question of abolstered presidency to be postponed until new legislatures to beelected in the 15 Soviet republics this spring can consider theidea.   In a platform approved last week, the Communist Party'spolicy-making Central Committee called for removal of the party'sconstitutional guarantee on power and set aside the strict Marxistprohibition against large-scale private ownership.   The Supreme Soviet will consider both issues. It scheduled areport Thursday morning on a bill that will allow Soviet citizensand foreigners alike to own property, including buildings andentire factories.</TEXT></DOC>
