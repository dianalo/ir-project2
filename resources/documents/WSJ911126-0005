The National Space Council, a White House group headed bythe vice president, decided that the new satellite, LandsatVII, would be funded by the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration and the Defense Department. Landsat VII wouldlargely be a copy of Landsat VI, scheduled for launch latenext year, an administration official said, so that users ofLandsat imagery could count on a steady stream of data intothe next decade. Landsat VII is expected to cost about $250million and be launched in 1997.                                                                                                          It wasn't clear whether the contract to build Landsat VIIwould go to the builders of Landsat VI -- General ElectricCo. and the Hughes Aircraft subsidiary of General MotorsCorp.   The provision of Landsat data, which is used to prospectfor minerals, study crops and provide the military withcoverage of wide swathes of the Earth, has been a continuingproblem since the Reagan administration decided to privatizethe marketing of the data. Earth Observation Satellite Co., ajoint venture of GE and Hughes Aircraft, has been marketingLandsat photos, but at a loss. Early in the Bushadministration, the Space Council scrounged togetheradditional funds to continue operations of Landsat IV and Vwhile Landsat VI was being built.   The decision to build the newest satellite came after ameeting yesterday, which included Vice President Quayle,Budget Director Richard Darman, NASA Administrator RichardTruly and Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood. But theplan follows closely the suggestions of House ScienceCommittee Chairman George Brown (D., Calif.), who has beenpushing the administration to commit to building the newsatellite.   Rep. Brown has said that the U.S. should investigate avariety of new Earth-sensing technology in a possiblefollow-up to Landsat VII. But he has suggested improvingLandsat VII's ability to focus on objects as small as fivemeters from Landsat VI's 15 meters. The administration hasn'tdecided on the exact configuration of the new satellite, butthe Pentagon in the past has opposed improving Landsat'sresolution out of concern that it would provide adversarieswith satellite data that would rival U.S. spy satellites.   The administration's decision to move responsibility forthe new satellite from the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration, which is building the $210 million LandsatVI, reflects the problems NOAA is having in funding a newgeneration of weather satellites called GOES-Next. Theconstruction of those satellites is being managed for NOAA byNASA and has run into a host of technical difficulties.   Still open to question is how much to charge academic andother nonprofit users for Landsat data. Universityresearchers have said they can no longer afford to useLandsat imagery because the costs have risen sharply sinceprivatization.   Rep. Brown has suggested providing Landsat photos togovernment agencies and nonprofit entities at cost as a wayto expand usage of the data. A spokesman for EarthObservation Satellite said that such a policy change couldmake the operation of Landsat VI unprofitable. He said hiscompany's business plan had called for operating Landsat VIout of the revenue it obtained from selling data. In thecurrent fiscal year, NOAA will pay the company $7.6 millionto operate Landsat IV and V.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
