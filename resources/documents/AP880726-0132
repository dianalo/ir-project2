Legislators who spoke on condition of anonymity reported on theshouting match in a closed-door meeting of the Defense and ForeignAffairs Committee, which signaled the start of Israel's electioncampaign.   Also Tuesday, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by thegoverning Likud bloc to intervene in a pre-elections squabble,paving the way for holding national and municipal elections onseparate dates, which Peres' left-of-center Labor party favors.   Likud has asked the high court to intervene in Monday'slegislative decision to oust a Likud committee chairman who blockeda bill separating national and local elections.   The decision means the bill will probably pass, a defeat forLikud, which had hoped to ride on the coattails of strong localcouncils and win more votes to the parliament.   Peres said Shamir's rightist Likud party inspired thePalestinian uprising by rejecting Secretary of State George P.Shultz's peace initiatives, which include an international MiddleEast conference.   Aides to Peres said he intends to make the peace negotiations acentral element in his campaign for the premiership in the Novemberelections.   Peres' right-wing adversaries, led by Shamir, have also vowed tomake peace in the occupied territories central to the campaign, andto attack Labor Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin for his failure toquell the nearly 7-month-old Arab uprising, in which 233Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed.   Labor supports a retreat from the occupied territories in returnfor peace, while Likud opposes any concessions to the Arabs. Thetwo parties have shared governmental powers after a 1984 coalitionagreement was forged to break an election stalemate.   Peres opened the two-hour foreign policy briefing by lashing outat Shamir, who implied that Labor sided with Egypt in a 1986Israeli government decision to submit a border dispute tointernational arbitration.   Recent Israeli news reports said the arbitors may restore toEgypt the strip of desert beach called Taba, which Israel seizedwhen it occupied Sinai in the 1967 Middle East War.   ``This is the first time in my life that someone who also votedfor the arbitration tries to absolve himself of responsibility,''Peres was quoted by Labor legislators as saying.   Peres accused Shamir of ``missing a chance for peace'' byfailing to accept Shultz's plan.   ``If it weren't for the sabotage of the peace process, of theShultz initiative, by half the government, then maybe we wouldn'tbe in the middle of the intefadeh,'' Peres reportedly said, usingthe Arabic word for ``uprising.''   Likud legislator Eliahu Ben-Elissar interrupted Peres, shouting,``You're not coming here with clean hands!''   He called Peres a ``bolshevik,'' referring to the Labor Party'sleft-leaning ideology.   Peres responded by shouting at Ben-Elissar, ``You're alwaysslandering! You act like a fascist!'' according to Labor legislatorMicha Harish.   Harish said the debate reflected the significance of the peaceissue in the election campaign. ``It will be without a doubt thecentral issue,' he said.   Pollsters predict a tight race between Labor and Likud, with thelatter holding a slight edge largely due to support for Israelihawkishness in response to the Palestinian uprising.</TEXT></DOC>
