He is preachingto the converted.   Near the front of the hall, an elderly man looks misty-eyed as the candidate says the party's commitment to social justice will never waver. People rise in applause as Mr. Rau demands that Germany export machinery, not arms, and when he promises tighter environmental laws to &quot;forever protect the Rhine.&quot;    But for all its enthusiasm, the audience is remarkably uniform. It is a sea of middle-aged and graying people with furrowed faces. Many work at the nearby Audi auto factory. The few young people in the building are outside the auditorium, passing out leaflets that call for a more strident course for the Social Democrats. They want, among other things, an immediate end to nuclear power, a view that Mr. Rau doesn't advocate and which isn't shared by the audience he has just addressed.    As Mr. Rau's divided party limps into the final days of West Germany's national election campaign, the outcome is no longer in doubt. Polls indicate that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and its coalition partners will draw some 55% of the Sunday vote.    Mr. Rau's Social Democrats appear headed for a rout, the scope of which has become the most compelling issue in an otherwise listless campaign, for it will determine the opposition party's future.    If the Social Democrats win less than 40% of the vote, as the polls indicate, the result will be &quot;a complete reshuffling of the leadership,&quot; predicts Ulrich Steger, a Social Democratic leader in the state of Hesse, where the party governs through a coalition with the Greens party, a loose collection of leftist activists that, among other things, oppose the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Such a reshuffling, he adds, would &quot;strengthen those who favor a movement to the left.&quot;    The Social Democrats were thwarted by the West German tendency to keep incumbent parties in power for long periods. The strength of the economic recovery also has boosted the ruling party.    But the Social Democrats have also been their own worst enemy. Scandals tainted the party image while ideological squabbles intensified. Divided into feuding left and right camps, the Social Democrats haven't rallied behind Mr. Rau, who admits he considered dropping out of the race.    Campaigning is &quot;hard work,&quot; says the 56-year-old candidate, speaking aboard his campaign train as it nears Munich, one of about 80 whistle stops on Mr. Rau's itinerary this month as he criss-crosses West Germany. After a crushing party defeat in Hamburg state elections in November, Mr. Rau says he asked himself, &quot;Is it worth it?&quot; But that thought lasted for only an hour, he says, and &quot;the day has 24.&quot;    Mr. Rau has ruled out a coalition with the Greens, for fear of alienating the party's moderate voters. But many Social Democratic leaders consider that a mistake, saying Mr. Rau's goal of an outright majority was a pipe dream that left the party without a credible victory strategy.    While Mr. Rau has rejected a so-called red-green coalition (the Social Democratic party banner is red), others favor at least a more open attitude toward cooperation with the Greens. Former Chancellor Willy Brandt, the party chairman, whose relations with Mr. Rau are said to be chilly, has tried to move the Social Democrats closer to Green positions. The party, for instance, accepted in its platform a 10-year phase-out of nuclear power.    Even so, the Social Democrats have been outflanked on the left by the Greens, who appear poised to score sizable gains because of environmental disasters such as Chernobyl and the Rhine chemical spills. The Greens have scored as high as 10.7% in the polls, almost double their tally in the 1983 elections when they first won representation in parliament.    &quot;What happened at Chernobyl can happen anywhere,&quot; says Wilfried Fuhrman, a college professor and former Social Democratic voter, who plans to vote Green this time. &quot;I'm not sure what the (Social Democratic) position really is&quot; with regard to nuclear power, he says, so great is their discord. &quot;But with the Greens,&quot; he adds, &quot;there's no doubt. They're against it and so am I.&quot;    The Greens stand to gain the most among young voters, who once were solidly Social Democratic. In the 18-to-24-year age group, the Greens poll 33% support, as do the Christian Democrats, according to the Allensbach research institute. But the Social Democrats hold only a 27% share, a clear indication to some that the party must move left.    The party has been moving left since it repudiated its own support for the 1979 decision to station nuclear missiles in Europe. That repudiation eventually led to the fall in 1982 of then-Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who favored missile deployment and couldn't quell dissent over the issue.    Since then, the Social Democrats have been leaderless and fragmented. Its candidate, Mr. Rau, is a moderate with a folksy, personal charm who was advised by Mr. Schmidt not to run unless he also held the party chairmanship. Its chairman, Mr. Brandt, is the firebrand and party patriarch who says he will retire after the election. He is popular with the party's younger wing, who can often be found pushing Soviet-backed disarmament proposals and calling for West German withdrawal from NATO's military structure.    &quot;The Social Democrats will move to the left. They must,&quot; asserts Hans-Joachim Veen, director of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a political research institute. &quot;Only from such a position will they be able to get a majority again.&quot; A political party, he adds, &quot;can't fight on both sides and expect to win.&quot;    Mr. Brandt has said that contenders to succeed him as party chairman won't become known until after the election. Meanwhile, Mr. Rau isn't sure whether he wants the job. &quot;I haven't decided yet,&quot; he says.
