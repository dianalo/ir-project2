This proposedrecovery project consists of rehabiliation of National Forest System (NFS)lands damaged by the wildfire and the recovery of dead and dying timberwhich is still merchantable. Due to the length of time its has taken todevelop an acceptable recovery program and to properly evaluate its effects,the time remaining for implementation has become critical. Any additionaldelay will result in significant loss of the salvable resources; therefore,the decision to rehabilitate the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest landsand offer salvage timber for sale in the Tepee Butte project area willnot be subject to administrative appeal pursuant to 36 CFR 217.4(a)(11).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Questions about this notice shouldbe directed to Bruce McMillan, Environmental Coordinator, Wallowa-WhitmanNational Forest, P.O. Box 907, Baker, Oregon 97814, Phone (503) 523-6391.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On August 25, 1988 a lightning stormmoved through the region and ignited a fire. Due to favorable burning conditionsand strong winds, the fire moved rapidly, consuming over 14,000 acres inthe first eight hours. During this time, it moved onto the Hells CanyonNRA of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. The fire was finally declaredcontrolled on September 8, 1988, after burning approximately 54,100 acres.In the aftermath of the Tepee Butte Fire the Forest Service had to decideif it should leave the burned area to recover naturally, rehabilitate theburned area, and/or provide the opportunity to salvage some of the fire-killedor severely damaged trees.Determining whether to rehabilitate the burned area involved decisionson how to do so, which part of the burned area should be rehabilitated,and determination of whether to provide the opportunity to salvage, whattype of logging to use, and whether roads should be built.In order to assist the Forest Service in making these difficult decisions,a site-specific, project environmental impact statement (EIS) was prepared.On October 7, 1988, the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS for thisrecovery project (53 FR 39492). Concurrent with the decision to initiatean EIS, was the Forest Service's commitment to fully involve the publicin the decision making process. In order to facilitate public involvement,the Forest Supervisor solicited public comment with a general mailer, innewpaper ads, and in four public scoping meetings. Over 2,700 letters invitingpublic participation on the recovery project were mailed in October. Meetingswith environmental groups, timber industry, local, state, and Federal agenciesand representatives were also held.Written comments were solicited through November 18, 1988. From the hundredsof opinions voiced and from written comments received, major issues emerged.Because of the area's unique character and sensitive ecosystems, some special-interestgroups have opposed developments such as roads, trails, and timber harvestsites. Some of the groups have maintained that either additional areasbe designated as wilderness or the area be redesignated as a National Park.In contrast, other groups believe part of the NRA should be managed toproduce high level of commodities, especially wood products.Development of the draft EIS resulted in considerable public and mediainterest. The Notice of Availability of the draft EIS was published inthe May 5, 1989, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 19425) and made available to the public.During the 45-day review period, which ended June 19, 1989, several publicmeetings were held in which Forest Service personnel were available toanswer questions and gather public input. News releases were issued toincrease public awareness of the project and to encourage participationby all interested parties. Open houses were held to allow the public toview planning alternatives and ask questions of the planning staff andinterdisciplinary team. Meetings took place between Forest Service personneland industry coalitions, environmental groups, chambers of commerce, andelected officials.The draft EIS has been reviewed and modified as a result of additionalanalysis and public comment received on the draft during the 45-day commentperiod. A timeline has been set and closely adhered to for the completionof the final EIS.An important factor in this project planning is the deterioration of fire-killedtimber. The project area contains large amounts of fire-killed and severelydamaged softwood timber. Affected timber begins to deteriorate as soonas it is dead. Weathering, insects, and decay of fire-killed or severelydamaged timber causes a rapid depreciation in soundness and selling value.The desire to minimize this loss was one of the primary reasons the TepeeButte Recovery Project was undertaken and why the final EIS was completedunder a relatively short timeline. The importance of this factor has beenfurther emphasized by recent court orders restraining federal timber sales,thus substantially reducting the normal flow of timber from Forest Serviceand Bureau of Land Management Lands in Oregon and Washington. Prompt availabilityof Tepee Butte Fire damaged timber can help alleviate the economic situationbrought about by the constricted timber supply.The Tepee Butte Recovery final EIS is scheduled to be released September,1989. This final EIS discloses the environmental effects of all the alternativesconsidered. Some environmental effects are probable with the implementationof any of the alternatives. These effects relate to recreation resources,visual resources, water quality/fisheries, wildlife habitat, long-termsite productivity, vegetation management, the transportation system, rapidtimber recovery, and social and economic factors.The earliest possible implementation of the Tepee Butte Recovery Projectdecision will minimize losses in value of the timber resource on the site,allow for the most timely rehabilitation and reforestation of the site,and maximize the return to the Treasury for timber affected by the fire.Processing administrative appeals can cause significant delays in implementingthe decision. For example, it could take 45 days to file an appeal, andadditional 100 days or more to complete the administrative review and possiblyanother 15 to 45 to complete a discretionary review. If a Stay were grantedduring the pendency of the appeal, project implementation could be delayedapproximately six months. A six-month delay would essentially mean thatno activities would commence during the current logging season. Since thetimber sales being proposed in the final EIS will have two year contracts,it is possible that a large portion of the timber volume will not be removeduntil the third logging season following the decision. Studies indicatethat significant deterioration will occur by then and the value of therecovered timber will greatly diminish.Pursuant to 36 CFR 217.4(a)(11), I have exempted this fire recovery projectfrom administrative appeal. The decision to rehabilitate lands and resourcesof the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest and to offer salvage timber forsale in the Tepee Butte project area will hereby not be subject to administrativeappeal. Results of the environmental analysis for this fire recovery project aredocumented in the Tepee Butte Recovery Project final EIS available at theSupervisor's Office, Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, P.O.
