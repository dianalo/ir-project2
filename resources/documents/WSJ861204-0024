Terms weren't disclosed. Staley, a corn-processing and restaurant-food supplier, said the Orange, Calif.-based unit, Collins Foodservice Inc., had fiscal 1986 sales of about $270 million.    Collins Foodservice is a distributor to fast-food restaurant chains in 10 western states, Staley said.    After the sale, Collins Foods will remain in the business of operating and franchising restaurants.    In Los Angeles, Christopher Thomas, Collins Foods' chief financial officer, said the company agreed to sell the unit in order to focus its &quot;energy and resources&quot; on its restaurant holdings. In the fiscal year ended last April 30, the food service unit, after eliminating $83 million in intracompany sales, accounted for about 36% of Collins Foods' $532 million in sales, Mr. Thomas said.    Staley said the acquisition, which is subject to a definitive agreement, is part of its strategy to expand its food service business, which generates annual sales of about $2 billion. Staley expanded into the business in 1984 when it acquired CFS Continental Inc.    The Collins Foodservice transaction would be Staley's fifth food service acquisition, a Staley spokesman said. He added that Staley plans to &quot;aggressively&quot; pursue more food service acquisitions.    Staley said the Collins Foodservice acquisition would expand its presence in the fast-food segment of the restaurant industry. The majority of Staley's distribution business has been with family restaurants, the Staley spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
