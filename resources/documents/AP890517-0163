Feshbach, a pioneer in Soviet demography, is in seventh heavenwith the greater openness under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``We used to complain that we did not have enough information.Now we complain that we have too much,'' said Feshbach, interviewedamid the mountains of Soviet documents at his Georgetown Universityoffice as he prepared for his congressional testimony.   On Wednesday, he told members of the congressional Commission onSecurity and Cooperation in Europe that under Gorbachev the Sovietswere beginning to allocate more resources to the sorely neglectedfields of housing and health care.   The need is severe, said Feshbach. For example, 40 percent ofSoviet medical school graduates cannot read a cardiograph; 800,000to 900,000 Soviets suffer every year from hepatitis, compared toabout 56,000 in the United States, and 1,100 to 1,500 Sovietannually come down with diphtheria, a disease that has virtuallydisappeared in the United States.   Such data are more easily available under Gorbachev, saidFeshbach, but still ``there is a lot missing. And the quality of alot of the information is up for grabs.''   Feshbach has been poring over Soviet statistics since 1955, andhis years of diligence have made him something of a legend inacademia and government agencies that deal with Moscow. Two yearsago, he worked in Brussels as the first Sovietologist-in-residencefor the secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   He experienced one of the high points in his career in lateJanuary, when he was allowed to accompany a Moscow census-taker, anexperience that he says taught him that the Soviets ``are verylikely to publish the figures in a more truthful fashion'' thanafter the last census in 1979. The results of that census dribbledout, with major gaps.   Preliminary results from the 1989 census already have beenpublished, and have joined the stacks of documents piled inFeshbach's office. Much of the news is bad for the Kremlin.   The population of the Moslem republics of Central Asia, wherethere is little industry and lots of underemployment, continued togrow at a much faster pace than in the Slavic republics, whereworkers are needed. Russia grew by 7 percent, compared to 28percent for Turkmenistan, 22 percent for Kirghizia, 29 percent forUzbekistan, and 34 percent for Tadzhikistan.   Other Soviet publications have reported that the percentage ofSoviet conscripts who come from the Moslem republics of CentralAsia and Caucasia has risen from 28 percent in 1980 to 37 percentin 1988, he said.   ``That was my projection for the year 2000,'' Feshbach told thecongressional panel. He had been predicting for years that theexploding population of Central Asia would pose problems,particularly in the Soviet military.   Recent Soviet articles have confirmed that the Central Asianconscripts have trouble mastering the Russian language and thecomplicated machinery of modern war.   ``Ninety percent of rural Central Asians do not speak Russian,''Feshbach told the congressional panel. ``That could lead to avolunteer army within five years or so.''   Feshbach, discussing the latest wave of Soviet statistics with areporter, sorted through census data to figure how many people diedin the Armenian earthquake last December.   He calculated that population of Armenia had been growing byabout 50,000 per year, added that to the 1988 figure, subtractedthe 1989 figure, and concluded that there are ``approximately250,000'' fewer people in Armenia than there would have been withno earthquake.   The official Soviet death toll: 25,000.</TEXT></DOC>
