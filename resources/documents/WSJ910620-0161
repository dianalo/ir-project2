But Congress, the AMA and the federal bureaucracy are onlycatching up with public sentiment. A 1990 Harvard Universitysurvey of 10 industrial nations found Americans the leastsatisfied with their health care. Eighty-nine percent agreedit needs either &quot;fundamental changes&quot; or &quot;completerebuilding.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Spiraling costs, incomplete coverage and bafflinginsurance arrangements head the list of American complaints.Americans spend 12.2% of their gross national product onmedical care vs. about 9% in Canada and Germany (the nexthighest spenders among the seven largest developedeconomies).   Despite these costs, between 30 million and 40 millionAmericans have no health insurance at all, and even therelatively well-insured worry about gaps in their coverage.And the paper work frustrates everyone. Other countries havecontrolled medical inflation by taking advantage of the powerof monopsony. A single purchaser faces providers, directly orindirectly, across the bargaining table.   In the U.S., by contrast, consumers must rely on thesellers of medical services to tell them how much to buy,while government programs or insurance companies pick up muchof the tab. Inflation is inevitable in such a market.Unsuccessful efforts to control spending by limiting patientchoice, monitoring physician decisions and increasing costsharing have frustrated physicians and patients alike.   One advantage, perhaps the only one, of being the lastindustrial nation to address this topic is that we can learnfrom the experience of others. Universal but administrativelydecentralized health insurance is workable. Australia allowsits states to administer their universal plans. West Germanyrelies on more than 1,200 sickness funds. The Canadianexperience, in particular, shows that decentralizationpermits considerable variation.   Canadian provinces must provide health insurance(Medicare) that is universal, comprehensive in benefits,publicly administered and portable across the country. Beyondthese core requirements, there is great variation: infinancing, in whether additional benefits are offered, inwhether there are insurance intermediaries between provincialgovernments and medical providers, and so on.   In the previously mentioned 10-nation survey, Canadianswere the happiest with their health-care system -- 56%reported overall satisfaction compared with 10% in the U.S.Before the introduction of national health insurance inCanada, they spent as much per capita as the U.S. on medicalcare. Now they spend about 30% less.   The West German system shows that it is possible tomandate universal health insurance through a variety ofindividual plans. Every German citizen is insured. Most areinsured by &quot;sickness funds&quot; that employers and unions jointlyrun. The unemployed have their own fund; so do retirees andthe disabled.   Individual plans negotiate collectively with medical-careproviders within the framework of aggregate targets set bygovernment. Coordination of all this is complex, but in the10-nation survey, Germans tied the French for third place insatisfaction.   Canadian and German doctors, like their Americancounterparts, are among their society's most highly paidprofessionals. In both countries physicians enjoy greaterautonomy in their work than in the heavily administered U.S.system. American doctors spend much more time than theirforeign counterparts on payment-related paperwork, and theirtreatment decisions are subject to far more intrusive routinemonitoring by insurers.   Like the U.S., Canada, Australia and West Germany are allfederal states. None are free of problems, but all cope withtensions among cost, access and quality better than the U.S.does. All pay their physicians on a fee-for-service basis,while managing to control total expenditures. None limitspatient choice of providers, as much as the &quot;managed care&quot;systems advocated by some reformers in the U.S.   The excuses offered for failing to learn from theseexperiences range from the serious to the silly. The claimthat American politics is too corrupt or incompetent tomanage a national health-insurance program without grosswastefulness is based on selective glances across nationalborders. Canada's government has been severely shaken bydefense procurement and influence-peddling scandals thatmatch America's savings-and-loan miseries. None of this hastouched Canada's Medicare, just as the U.S. scandals haveleft the Social Security Administration unscathed. Publiccorruption is not an exclusively American product; norcompetent public servants exclusively foreign.   Exaggerated claims are also made that America's undeniablymore numerous poor (and more violent cities) would overwhelmany national health-insurance system. Additional spendingwould indeed be required to cover America's uninsured, butthe GAO estimates the additional cost at $12 billion -- anamount dwarfed by the administrative savings alone of aCanadian-style plan. (The costs of the greater violence ofU.S. cities are already incorporated in the budgets of urbanemergency rooms.)   True but irrelevant to the virtues of national healthinsurance is Canada's free-riding on American biomedicalresearch. Research costs can and should be shared amongindustrial nations; a more disciplined American health budget(and shrunken medical profits) would surely prompt suchpooling.   The most widespread and silly of the excuses for ignoringthe Canadian experience is the claim that Canadian medicalcare is undesirably poor in access, quality and managerialacumen. Critics of Canadian arrangements make much ofwell-publicized bottlenecks in the delivery of somespecialized services. But Canadians generally find it easierthan Americans to obtain most forms of medical care. Theyhave more general hospital beds per capita, stay longer inhospital when sick, and use more physician services perperson. If judged by infant mortality and longevity, Canadianmedical care is better than American.   American medicine needs reform. How to pay for care, howto distribute the burden of this finance fairly, how to placedefensible borders on what is spent for medical care, and howto assure that this care is reasonably reliable andacceptably administered -- these are hard questions. Codewords like &quot;the market,&quot; &quot;national health insurance&quot; and&quot;managed care&quot; provide no answers. We need less talk aboutAmerican uniqueness and more willingness to listen to whatothers can tell us.   ---   Mr. Marmor, a professor at Yale's School of Management,co-authored with Yale law professor Jerry Mashaw and New Yorkattorney Philip Harvey &quot;America's Misunderstood WelfareState&quot; (Basic, 1990).
