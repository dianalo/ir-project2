During the past few days, administration officials have become resigned to the certainty that Congress would kill the proposed arms sale. In the Senate, Sens. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.) and Robert Packwood (R., Ore.) organized 67 senators to oppose the sale -- enough to override a presidential veto.    But the withdrawal still came as a surprise. According to a Senate aide, a State Department official arrived at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with a letter announcing the withdrawal one minute before the panel was scheduled to begin considering a resolution to block the sale.    The extent of the opposition doesn't reflect congressional objections to the actual weapons sale so much as apprehension over the administration's overall policy in the Persian Gulf. After the recent Iraqi attack on the USS Stark, which killed 37 crewmen, lawmakers have expressed concern over the expanding U.S. role in the region.    Later this month, the Navy will re-flag 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers to sail under U.S. protection. Top administration officials have described the mission in broad terms, suggesting that the U.S. intends to assure navigational freedom in the gulf, and that it hopes to prevent the Soviet Union from gaining influence there.    Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) yesterday charged that the administration lacks a &quot;coherent policy&quot; in the Persian Gulf. This week, many administration officials have been called before committees in both chambers to explain the U.S. gulf policy.    The proposed sale also ran into problems for reasons other than concern about U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf. Congressional leaders were angry that the administration didn't consult with Congress before proposing the sale. &quot;Sometimes it pays to consult,&quot; said Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.).    In addition, opponents of the sale included a number of pro-Israel lawmakers who usually fight arms sales to Arab states. Moreover, there is some irritation in Congress toward Saudi Arabia. Last month, Saudi pilots in U.S.-built F-15 fighter jets observed the Iraqi Mirage jet just after it fired two Exocet missiles at the Stark, but failed to meet a U.S. request that they intercept the plane. The Saudi pilots said they weren't able to gain permission from the Saudi command center in time to perform the intercept.    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, a longtime friend of the Saudis, has defended the Saudis' actions during the Stark incident. The Saudis communicated with the Stark as the Iraqi plane approached, and were helpful once firefighting efforts began aboard the stricken vessel.    The administration hopes to revive the Maverick sale at a more auspicious time. Pentagon officials figure that in a less-charged political environment, the sale of the ground missiles would be relatively noncontroversial. The Saudis already have a less-sophisticated version of the weapon, which is produced by the Hughes Aircraft unit of General Motors Corp.    Another proposed Saudi sale also is on hold. Two weeks ago, the administration decided to withhold a proposal to sell 12 F-15 fighter jets meant to replace those that have been damaged or ruined. </TEXT></DOC>
