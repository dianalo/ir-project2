In June, 1985, the Departmentof Energy of USA decided to adopt atomic laser process as the next uraniumenrichment method, interrupting the project of centrifugal separation.This publication exerted a large influence to the whole world, and themove of promoting the development of the laser process is seen in variouscountries. Also in Japan, the uranium enrichment discussion meeting ofthe Atomic Energy Commission organized 'Laser process technology workinggroup', and the report on the objective of reasearch and the system forpromoting the developemet was presented. The principle of laser isotopeseparation is to selectively excite an isotope by utilizing the differenceof absorption spectra among isotopes and the separate it by physicalor chemical method. Isotope shift and the method of separation are explained.The verification of atomic process laser uranium enrichment was carriedout by two-step photoionization. The concept of an enrichment plant,and a copper vapor laser are described. Also the present status of molecularprocess laser uranium enrichment is shown. (Kako, I.).</TEXT></DOC>
