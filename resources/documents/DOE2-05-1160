The rapid increasein the concentration of such species as methane, nitrous oxide, hydrocarbonsand chlorofluorocarbons reveals the importance of the anthropogenic componentof the sources of these constituents. The chemical or photochemical decompositionof these primary pollutants at various altitudes will in turn perturbthe physicochemical equilibrium of the atmosphere and in particular theozone layer. The consequences of such modifications are analysed in termsof climatic (increase in the greenhouse effect, modification of the temperaturevertical distribution) and biological effects (increase in solar ultravioletradiation, oxydation and acidification of the lower atmosphere).</TEXT></DOC>
