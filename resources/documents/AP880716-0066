Whatever his faults, the 61-year old Presser, in his five yearsas the Teamsters' president, had tried to counter an image of thenation's largest union as an adjunct of organized crime.   He launched an aggressive public relations campaign and openedthe union, at least partially, to more public view. He also movedthe Teamsters back into the mainstream of the labor movement,directing its reaffiliation with the AFL-CIO last October after 30years of warfare between the two bodies.   Presser died on July 9, and some see the election this past weekof William J. McCarthy, 69, of Boston, over Presser's handpickedheir, Secretary-Treasurer Weldon Mathis, as a repudiation of thoseefforts. McCarthy was picked by a 9-8 majority among the 17 membersof the Teamsters executive board.   His victory, according to several sources in the union, wasorchestrated by Teamster power broker Joseph Trerotola of New York,who at 70 is the most powerful vice president and head of Teamstersoperations in 15 East Coast states.   ``The old East Coast guys won over the progressives,'' said onesource close to the Teamsters, adding that the battle is likely tobe refought at the Teamsters' next convention in 1991. ``Two yearsfrom now, you're going to start seeing people campaigning likecrazy.''   Neither Trerotola nor McCarthy has ever been indicted.   And McCarthy is described by other union leaders in the Bostonarea as being stubborn, headstrong and sometimes a maverick _ butfree of ties with known mob leaders.   ``He's a hard-nosed (expletive),'' said one official withanother union, speaking on the condition of anonymity, ``but he'sclean. Nobody's ever had any words about him and he has a greatrapport with all of the other unions in Boston.''   Trerotola also is described as ``clean.'' But Trerotoladeveloped the nickname ``Joe Shrugs'' within the union because hefeared dealing with corruption in some Teamster locals in New Yorkand New Jersey, according to Steven Brill, author of a 1978best-selling book on the union, ``The Teamsters.''   Presser, himself under indictment at the time of his death oncharges of embezzlement and labor racketeering, had pushed Mathis,62, of Atlanta, as his successor in the event of his death.   Mathis and Walter Shea, a veteran Teamster bureaucrat who haddirected the union's headquarters staff during the reigns ofPresser and his two predecessors, Roy Williams and FrankFitzsimmons, had the closest ties of any of the union's nationalleaders with the AFL-CIO.   Both were instrumental behind the scenes in the Teamsters'decision last October to reaffiliate with the labor federation,three decades after being expelled on charges of corruption. AndAFL-CIO officials were known to be enthusiastic about either one ofthem succeeding Presser.   According to sources within the Teamsters, McCarthy andTrerotola both initially opposed rejoining the AFL-CIO, althoughMcCarthy said upon his election that he intends ``to do everythingpossible to work as a team'' with the federation.   Spurring McCarthy's victory, according to several sources, was abelief that Presser's focus on raising the union's political andpublic profile as a strategy for fighting the corruptionallegations had backfired.   As evidence of that, they cite Presser's indictment in 1986 eventhough government documents indicate that FBI agents may haveencouraged him to perpetuate a payroll-padding scheme, on which thecharges are based, in their use of him as a government informant.   And despite Presser's open courtship of the Reaganadministration for five years, the Justice Department just twoweeks ago filed a civil lawsuit seeking to impose a governmenttrusteeship over the entire union.   The government's preparation of the suit had been leaked toreporters a year ago. Hints from prosecutors that other AFL-CIOunions would be targeted next was a major impetus behind theTeamsters' reaffiliation last fall.   Mathis had been considered a shoo-in for succeeding Presser,particularly after the union's constitution was rewritten in 1986to name him as interim president instead of Trerotola if Presserwas incapacitated.   Just before undergoing brain surgery in May, Presser passedthose reins to Mathis, naming him interim president for 120 days.   However, at about the same time, 64 percent of the votingrank-and-file members had just cast ballots against the NationalMaster Freight Agreement, the union's largest contract negotiatedunder Mathis' leadership with the interstate trucking industry.   McCarthy, who openly opposed the contract, said Friday that hewill try to reopen it and ``get the wishes of our membership.''   But he also indicated a reluctance to allowing the public muchmore of a view into the Teamsters' internal decision-making.   ``I don't think it's any of your business,'' he told reportersseeking the breakdown of the vote on his election. ``I got enoughvotes to become the president.''</TEXT></DOC>
