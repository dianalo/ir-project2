 As a sort of free-form software tool, HyperCardpromised users to their individual needs and styles.andP;  And, in some ways,HyperCard fulfilled that promise.andM;Now, however, HyperCard looks little worn.andP;  Its cards were designed and sizedto fit the screen of a compact Mac (Plus, SE, or SE/30); on a Mac with alarger screen, the cards float like islands on the desktop background.andO;HyperCard did not support color, and, while it did support visual effects,those effects did not show up on a color monitor unless the monitor was setto black-and-white.andM;THE NEW VERSION.andP;  Apple has introduced a major revision of HyperCard: Version2.0.andP;  This version corrects some of the previous problems and reduces others;it also adds new functionality to the product.andP;  This functionality, in turn,seems to point to some interesting possibilities for users of HyperCard.andM;Variable Card Sizes.andP;  In HyperCard 2.0, the user can choose the size of thecards.andP;  When creating a stck, HyperCard can automatically make cards the sizeof the user's screen, or the user can size  card by dragging it to thedesired shape or by supplying the card dimensions in one of several units oflength.andP;  A user can lso change the size of the cards of an existing stack(conforming to HyperCard's user-customizability).andM;So, suppose a user has designed a HyperCard stack to run a multimedia demo.andO;Now the person viewing that stack never has to see the Mac OS.andP;  The cards canfill the screen and take over the running of the demo.andM;The cards in a single stack must all be the same size.andP;  However, we feel thatthis limitation is not a significant drawback.andP;  Having all cards in a stackthe same size helps maintain the consistency of that stack.andP;  Besides, a userwho develops an application that needs cards of different sizes can have twoor more stacks with different card sizes (see &quot;Multiple Windows&quot; below).andM;Multiple Windows.andP;  HyperCard 2.0 lets a user open more than one stack at atime.andP;  This adds flexibility to moving and transferring data among stacks,allowing a user to develop more sophisticated applications in HyperCard.andM;Color (Sort Of).andP;  Cards themselves cannot be colored, but HyperCard candisplay color graphics in a window.andP;  And HyperCard control windows(user-definable windows that users can program to perform various controlactions, e.g., move to next card, start CD player, etc.) can have color.andP;  Inaddition, special effects now work on a color screen without having to resetthe display to black-and-white.andM;HyperTalk Improvements.andP;  HyperTalk is HyperCard's programming language(script language).andP;  HyperTalk is now easier to use yet more powerful.andO;HyperTalk allows background processing under MultiFinder (long processes canbe left running in the background while the user works with another programor another stack).andP;  And HyperTalk is now faster.andP;  A script is compiled thefirst time it is run, and the compiled version is stored.andP;  This gives greaterspeed on subsequent runs.andP;  There is a new script editor with debugging tools,which helps speed up development.andM;Menu Bar Control.andP;  HyperCard 2 lets the user have control of the menu bar.andP;  Auser can add, delete, and change items, creating a fully customized andpersonalized menu bar interface.andM;Support for Hypertext.andP;  In text fields, words, selected groups of words,words of a particular style and/or size, whole lines, and individualcharacters can all be used as hypenext buttons--double-clicking on the textactivates the button: So, a user could set up a card with a text field whereevery bold word was a hyper-link to a related card.andP;  (An aside: HyperCard 2.0allows a user to have more than one font, style, or size in one text field, anecessary ability for hypertext to be useful.)andM;Shared-Code Libraries.andP;  HyperCard 2.0 supports shared-code libraries amongstacks.andP;  Suppose a user builds a CD controller into one stack.andP;  Then otherstacks don't need to have a controller built in; those other stacks can makeuse of the controller from the first stack.andP;  This reduces duplication ofeffort in Hypertalk scripts.andP;  Up to 11 stacks can be linked to share code.andM;Improved Printing.andP;  HyperCard now prints more quickly, conveniently, andeasily, and with much more control than before.andP;  HyperCard relies less on bitmaps and more on PostScript for printing (e.g., in a card with text in thebackground, if HyperCard can find a PostScript version of the font, it willuse that instead of using a bit map of the font).andP;  HyperCard now allows morecontrol and flexibility in printing reports; this makes it more convenient touse HyperCard for development of database-like stacks.andM;IMPRESSIONS.andP;  HyperCard 2.0's improvements are useful--this HyperCard is apowerful tool.andP;  A developer could use HyperCard, with its feature set at itsability to make use of external commands (XCMDs), as a front end forpractically anything.andP;  HyperCard could be the front end to a database, to amainframe, to an E-mail system, to any dial-up service, etc.andM;With HyperCard's control of the Mac's menus and full-screen-sized cards onany Mac, a developer could turn HyperCard into the user's interface to theMac.andP;  Therefore, instead of seeing the Mac OS after starting the computer,the user would see the developer's own interface, wholly run by HyperCard.andO;This also means that HyperCard could be used to build a prototype of aninterface for any sort of computer.andM;Full-screen-size cards now allow HyperCard to run multimedia presentationswithout being interrupted by the Mac desktop.andP;  And HyperCard's buttons andnew hypertext abilities contribute to HyperCard's appropriateness as amultimedia development, too.andP;  HyperTalk allows support for text, graphics,video, sound, voice, and animation.andM;CONCLUSIONS.andP;  HyperCard is not an end-user programming tool.andP;  But HyperCard 2is easier to use than earlier versions; end users can more easily customizeHyperCard programs.andM;And HyperCard is now more powerful for developers.andP;  For current programmerswho need to do programming on the Mac, HyperCrd is much easier than workingin C or Pascal, and HyperCard can be just as powerful.andM;Just as in any programming environment, there will be both good and badprograms developed with HyperCard.andP;  But the good programs can now be verygood.andP;  And HyperCard's particular talents in the interface-building arenashould make it very popular for multimedia presentation developers, interfacedevelopers, and anyone else who wants to control the look and feel of his orher computer interface.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
