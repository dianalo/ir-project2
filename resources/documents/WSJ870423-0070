Michigan General had said last month that it may be forced into Chapter 11 if it were unsuccessful in efforts to exchange $110 million of debt. The retailer of homebuilding products, which relies on Diamond Lumber for about 87% of sales, had a $39.3 million loss last year. The Diamond Lumber stores have been hurt because they rely heavily on lumber sales, which have been sluggish and barely profitable.    Michigan General said the bankruptcy-law filing won't affect Krestmark Industries Inc. and related units currently up for sale.    Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay debt.    Company officials couldn't be reached for comment on the filing, which was made in federal bankruptcy court in Dallas, the Diamond Lumber unit's base.    Michigan General, whose main lender is Manufacturers Hanover Corp., has long-term debt of $90 million and short-term debt of $45 million. Details of the bankruptcy-law filing and which creditors are exposed weren't immediately available. </TEXT></DOC>
