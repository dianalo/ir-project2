This is despite therhetoric in the treaty pinpointing &quot;price stability&quot; as &quot;theprimary objective&quot; of the future institution. This is onereason for French President Francois Mitterrand to feeltriumphant. The second reason bodes equally ill for the unityof Europe. France's unjustified obsession with Germany hasled to a dangerous misinterpretation of the mark not asproviding balance and self-restraint, but as an instrument ofpower.   The establishment of the first cross-continent centralbank in 1913, the U.S. Federal Reserve System, heralded thefirst death of the gold standard. With the creation of acontinent-wide bank of issue, the value of gold ceased to bethe great regulator of prices since the value of gold tendedto be influenced by the value of the dollar (contingent uponthe Fed's operations on the money market) instead of theother way around. To maintain the complete integrity of thedollar would have required an unrealistic degree ofself-restraint on the part of the governors of the mostpowerful monetary institution ever created.</LP><TEXT>   However, the need for a sound currency is so deeply linkedwith a well-functioning free-market economy that a revival ofthe gold standard was urged upon the world by the U.S. itselfafter World War II. The world is still reaping the fruits ofthis revival in the form of free trade, initiated in the late1950s and early '60s during the golden age of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade and the beginning of theEuropean Common Market. But the gold-based Bretton WoodsSystem collapsed between 1971 and 1973. Since then, thegold-standard spirit has been best kept alive by the GermanBundesbank.   The Bundesbank is commonly blamed for high interest rates,but until recently Germany, along with Switzerland, has beenthe country where borrowing -- and especially long-termborrowing -- was the cheapest in the world. The main reasonthis is no longer the case is not reunification but the factthat German monetary policy fell victim to strong and badlytimed pressures from abroad. An example is the huge creationof money from 1987 to 1988 as a consequence of theBundesbank's support for the dollar and rescue of the Frenchfranc under the Chirac-Balladur government.   For political reasons, the Bundesbank has beenincreasingly obliged to practice what it dislikes most --dirty floating. A genuine gold standard shares two essentialfeatures with clean floating: It subordinates monetary policyto the achievement of domestic stability, and it does notallow a central bank to print money by purchasing foreigncurrencies.   It is argued that by deciding to set up a so-called&quot;independant&quot; European central bank, the 12 heads of stateand governments convened in Maastricht last month haveadopted the &quot;German model.&quot; But they have done so only in acosmetic way. It turns out that the best of the Germany'spast 40 years of experience has been discarded. All throughthis period Germany, in contrast with its neighbors, hasavoided &quot;stop-go&quot; and the so-called policies of austerity,indefinitely prolonged under the name of &quot;wage discipline&quot;and the like. The reason for this has been the Bundesbank'srapid reaction to any disturbances threatening the reasonablestability of the purchasing power of its money, whatever thestate of the economy. In short, monetary policy was not aimedat fine-tuning economic activity.   The monetary and economic philosophy behind the mostimportant provisions of the Maastricht agreement takes aquite different approach. I would call it the &quot;Delors model,&quot;an ordinary mix of social democracy and second-rate monetarydoctrine inspired by a consensus among international&quot;experts.&quot; To get to the crux of the matter, let's look atthe method of assessing which nations will, in 1997 andlater, be deemed fit to participate in the monetary union.According to the Maastricht criteria, approved with thedecisive support of France, only France, along with Denmarkand Ireland, could join -- and so renounce forever the optionof devaluation. &quot;Vive le President Mitterrand]&quot; Among theconditions set, a prominent one is that a country should notrun an &quot;excessive budget deficit.&quot; What does that mean?   Originally, the Germans proposed a criterion that had adecisive merit: Its fulfillment would have automaticallyredressed a government's budget difficulties by allowing onlygovernment investment expenditures to be financed throughdeficits, that is to say through borrowing. This solutionrenders public capital spending contingent upon the market'scapability and willingness to finance it. To be sure, it alsohas its drawbacks. In the real world, the line dividingordinary expenditures and investment expenditures is notclear cut. But this criterion is much clearer than the onechosen at Maastricht. Moreover, it provides politicalaccountability because people can understand its meaningthrough their own experiences.   According to the Maastricht agreement, an &quot;excessive&quot;deficit is basically a deficit exceeding 3% of gross domesticproduct. In spite of the modern prejudices in favor ofmeasurements related to national accounting, there is nosignificant relationship between the amount of &quot;sustainable&quot;borrowing and a country's gross domestic product. In France,for example, the above mentioned percentage currently standsat a low 1.5%. But this figure says nothing about the majorhandicap in French budgetary policy -- the fact thatservicing the national debt pre-empts a rapidly and ominouslygrowing share of public expenditures. The percentage of thepublic expenditure dedicated to debt-servicing was 12% in1991 compared to 4% in 1980, and the percentage is stillgrowing.   For still more compelling reasons, the Delors approachignores what the business of money and credit is all about.One of the tenets of the Maastricht agreement is that notonly will there be a single currency (or national currencies&quot;irrevocably&quot; fixed with one another) for the united Europebut also that the central bank will conduct a single monetarypolicy. The rationale for that is that there can be only oneinterest rate for assets of the same maturity and risk forall the participants, whatever the currency denomination ofthe assets.   But this misses the point. It is artificial to devise amonetary system in which differences in interest rates amongcountries will depend only upon &quot;risk,&quot; i.e. upon the averagequality of the signatures of the debtors in each participantcountry. In the real free market, international interestrates depend also upon other factors -- which vary fromcountry to country -- such as the level of wages, theprofitability of investments, budget deficits, tax systems.   If dollars are commonly used in Moscow, they are surelynot lent there at the same rate as in New York] TheMaastricht agreement cannot be applied without creatingintolerable tensions among nations. For example, on the basisof a single interest rate, Germany would have to indefinitelysupport a French socialist government.   The European Community has been a success story becausethe whole structure was founded upon the understanding that,even in matters where unanimity is not required, no memberstate should be forced into accepting what it considersdangerous for its own interests. That has provided anefficient check against both arrogance and over-ambition.   It is a fact that the Germans are one of the few peoplesin the world who are in love with their central bank. Themark is widely viewed by the German population as a conditionfor prosperity. But Germany in general and Chancellor HelmutKohl in particular are also rightly afraid that unifiedGermany will be rejected as a &quot;normal&quot; partner by France.   President Mitterrand has played for months on this &quot;Germanuneasiness&quot; in the most outrageous way, with the objective ofimposing upon Bonn the sacrifice of the mark on the falseassumption that the level of interest rates in France is&quot;dictated&quot; by the gnomes in Frankfurt. (Why was it not sowhen the German rates were several points lower than inFrance?) By so doing Mr. Mitterrand has satisfied what hasbecome an obsession for a majority of the Frenchestablishment -- how to curb Germany when it is stillpossible to do so. This desire is so emotional that nobodysees the contradiction with the other French dream: Totransform the EC into a superpower.   The French obsession with Germany has led to another andpossibly tragic misjudgment. The &quot;strong&quot; mark is viewed asan instrument for a strong Germany, whereas it has proved tobe, since 1948, a factor of moderation. The money is &quot;strong&quot;because the government cannot manipulate it at will; it isstrong because credit is allowed to expand in conformity withthe strict practices that would prevail under a goldstandard. That means that German corporations do not haveunlimited power to invest in or buy foreign corporations.   One cannot wish that Germany will go on being a balancedcountry with restrained ambitions and, as the French havedone in Maastricht, introduce into Europe's future the&quot;socialist national&quot; notion of an industrial policy -- i.e.subsidized and unchecked industry -- and an ill-defined ECU.Yet, that was basically the Mitterrand stance.   ---   Mr. Fabra writes for the French newspaper, Le Monde.</TEXT></DOC>
