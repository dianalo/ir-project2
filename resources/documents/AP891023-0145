Six candidates opposed to Mugabe's avowed aim of a one-partystate in one of Africa's few Western-style democracies willchallenge four contenders from the governing Zimbabwe AfricanNational Union.   The outcome from the elections in rural areas will be abarometer of support for Mugabe's movement. Most of the country's 9million people live in such areas.   The by-elections were set for Tuesday and Wednesday in theparliamentary districts of Chirumanzu, Gwanda, Kariba and MasvingoNorth. Results are expected to be announced Thursday.   The voting comes at a time of mounting disenchantment with agovernment that took over when the British colony of Rhodesiagained independence as Zimbabwe in 1980.   Many Zimbabweans are now upset about reports of top-levelcorruption and self-aggrandizement by politicians who preachegalitarian ideals.   Many in this country also complain about rising prices andshortages of basic commodities, mounting unemployment and abreakdown in public services.   Earlier this month, the University of Zimbabwe was closed afterviolent anti-government demonstrations. At least 15 studentsremained in detention.   The country's top labor leader, Zimbabwe Congress of TradeUnions secretary-general Morgan Tsvangirai, was also detained afterhe supported the students.   In addition, at least 11 officials of the opposition ZimbabweUnity Movement who campaigned for this week's by-election in thenorthwest Kariba constituency were detained on unspecifiedallegations.   At least 150,000 voters have registered for the by-elections,which will send candidates to the 100-member National Assembly. Theseats were left vacant by the resignations of three politicianslinked to official corruption and another politician who died.   Mugabe's party is supported by all but two lawmakers in theNational Assembly and the 40-seat Senate.   The leader of the Unity Movement, Edgar Tekere, holds one seatand an independent the other. Tekere's movement vows to crushofficial corruption, attract foreign investment to create new jobs,and to keep Zimbabwe a multiparty socialist democracy.   Mugabe says he wants Zimbabwe transformed into a one-party stateafter general elections before April next year. To legally achievehis aim, he needs the unanimous support of Parliament.</TEXT></DOC>
