Alongwith diagrams and tables a survey deals with the reasons of limited solarenergy uses. A discussion of energy economic aspects is followed by remarksas to the feasibility of solar engineering with several uses and examplesfacilitating access to the present situation. Details are given on low-temperatureflat plate collectors and water heating. Other solar energy uses consistin high-temperature solar power plants, and solar cells for electricpower generation (systems diagrams, operation, energy balance, fabrication).Reference is made to photobiological processes (photosynthesis, biophotolysis),photochemical (photodissociation) and photoelectrochemical (electricpower and hydrogen production) processes. The study arrives at the conclusionthat neither the present technical nor the present economic conditionsallow for a sudden speedy replacement of present energy sources by solarenergy supplies.
