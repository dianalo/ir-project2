<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-1007 </DOCNO><TEXT>Magnets for advanced hadron facility secondary beam lines will be positionedclose to targets at which nuclear radiation levels will be about 10/sup8/ rad/h. New designs are proposed in which the magnet coils are remotefrom the beam apertures and are shielded from radiation by the polesor other non-magnetic shielding material. The magnet yokes and polesare integrated into the radiation shielding surrounding the targets.If necessary, the coils can be removed for servicing without exposingthe parts of the magnet with very high residual radiation fields. itwill also be necessary to have vacuum joints adjacent to the magnetsbecause the parts of the magnet close the to the beam tube should neverhave to be removed for maintenance.</TEXT></DOC>
