as they did during the most recent PS/2 launch, yourgut reaction is to wonder how the company took so long to reach thisconclusion.andM;Almost everyone in the PC industry has at the least been paying lip-serviceto the concept of client/server computing.andP;  The basic idea of client/servercomputing is to offload tasks from the central processing unit to localworkstations or X.Window terminals, which at the minimum process their owngraphics.andM;IBM has made several moves in this direction in its regular pronouncementsabout SAA and office automation tools such as OfficeVision.andP;  However, the keyword missing from these grand schemes has been 'cheap'.andP;  Customers areexpected to use hefty computing engines such as AS/400 minicomputers or even370 mainframes, which run proprietary operating environments like OS/400, MVSand VM.andM;The role of the microcomputer -- in the form of the PS/2 configured with vastamounts of memory (as much as 8Mb in some cases, when running OfficeVision)and running OS/2 -- has been to act as a workstation/terminal in the grandSAA plan.andM;Meanwhile, companies like Compaq have done very nicely addressing the needsof smaller businesses.andP;  These companies cannot afford the scenario outlinedabove and, in many cases, do not require all the hardware and software that'spart of the IBM deal.andM;It is nothing to note that high-end PC manufacturers have been increasinglysuccessful at challenging the established minicomputer manufacturers inproviding small business and department customers with sufficient power fortheir needs.andP;  25 and 33MHz 386 PCs, to say nothing of the fast-arriving486-based and multiprocessing PC servers, are set to further eclipose thetraditional role of the minicomputer as a departmental server.andP;  One look atthe balance sheets of Wang, Prime, Data General or even Digital providessufficient proof of this.andM;IBM realized that it must really do something to discourage workstationmanufacturers such as Sun and Hewlett-Packard/Apollo from attacking anothersection of the minicomputer market.andM;It resonded in a striking fashion by releasing the RS/6000 range ofworkstations running AIX (IBM's version of Unix), even though this made theAS/400 look strikingly underpowered for some tasks by comparison.andM;IBM's latest unveiling of two new floor-standing ranges of PS/2s -- the Model65 and the Model 80 -- is intended to address the fact that, in the words ofits manager for personal systems small business solutions Alan Thompson, &quot;IBMhas not traditionally bee strong in the small business market.&quot;andM;US commentators have suggested that when IBM saw Compaq's SystemPro, itrealized that it had to come up with something good to replace itsunderpowered range of servers, principally its ageing range of floor-standingPS/2s.andP;  The company came up with the Model 80; the 286-based Model 60 hasalready been phased out.andM;Given that, according to Thompson, small businesses with 16 or less employeesaccount for, &quot;the vast majority of industry and over 50 per cent of theworking population,&quot; IBM desperately needs it new servers to be a success.andM;It looks as if the wait may have been north it.andP;  IBM has, as last, releasedtwo lines of competitively priced PS/2 servers aimed at the small businessesit has so far failed to reach.andM;The Model 65 is based around the Intel 386SX and it is aimed at theentry-level market for servers.andP;  It retails for around 3,546 pounds with a120Mb SCSI drive.andP;  According to Thompson the Model 65 is aimed at smallbusinesses that require a server for up to 16 users.andM;The Model 80 is a 25MHz 386-based servre with a 64Kb cache memory and the-A31 version -- costing 7,831 pounds -- comes with a 320Mb SCSI drive asstandard.andM;As IBM has accurately pointed out with the release of these new servers, whatis most important is not so much the raw computing power of the CPU --providing this is adequate -- but the system throughput.andP;  This simple fact isoften overlooked when people make meaningless comparisons between the rawnumber crunching power of high-end PCs with minicomputers like the AS/400,which have better I/O capabilities.andM;IBM has addressed this by launching a range of IBM designed and manufacturedSCSI drives for the PS/2 range.andP;  IBM claims that these are &quot;among the fastestin the industry&quot;.andP;  With a claimed access time of 12.5ms, the company isn'twrong.andM;Accompanying the release of the servrs was the release of two SCSI driver MCAbusmaster cards.andP;  One is 16-bit; the second, a 32-bit card with 0.5Mb ofon-board cache memory, is capble of an astonishing 16.6Mbps burst mode datatransfer rate.andP;  It can be fitted to any PS/2 and costs 717 pounds.andP;  Giventhat each of the SCSI drivers can daisy-chain up to seven 320Mb storagedevices, the potential storage capacity of a PS/2 server is in the gigabyterange.andM;Another obstacle to PC servers competing fully with minicomputers is said tobe the availability of suitable software.andP;  Two products aimed at addressingthis were announced at the same time as the servers.andM;Firstly, as expected, IBM announced a radical overhaul of its Cinderellaverson of Unix for the PS/2, AIX.andM;By April, the new version, called PS/2 AIX 1.2, will have a GUI and AIXWindows (based on OSF/Motif), with NeXTstep -- intended mainly for AIXapplications developers - to follow in October.andP;  AIX 1.2 is Postx-compliant(for greater applications portability) and has X.Window support, DOS Affinity(a module which allows multiple DOS and AIX sessions to run concurrently) andVT220 terminal support.andM;IBM is also announcing a new range of sub-500 pounds ACSII terminals calledthe 3151 range.andP;  This wil enable IBM to supply customers with cheapPS/2-based multi-user systems, where once they would have tried to sell themAS/400s or LAMs made up of more expensive PS/2s running LANServer.andM;Perhaps even more significantly, IBM is effectively making the PS/2 Model 80the entry-level model for the AS/400, in direct competition with the AS/Entry-- a weakly disguised System/36 minicomputer.andM;This is achieved by the release of a piece of software bought from CaliforniaSoftware that is called RPG II Application Platform.andP;  This, in effect, makesOS/2 a multi-user operating system with the ability to allow up to 16 usersto run recompiled System/36 applications.andM;So far 19 of the existing RPG II applications have been ported to thisenvironment and IBM says that many more are on their way.andP;  For IBM this hastwo advantages: firstly, as many users will vouch, OS/2 desperately needsmore applications and secondly it will give the AS/400 an upgrade paththrough the PS/2 which just does not exist at present.andM;The whole launch shows that IBM realizes how desperate its situations is inthe server market.andM;However, it is foolish to underestimate Big Blue; unlike its competitors suchas Compaq, now that it can offer a decent server product to small businesses,it can offer two upgrade routes (SAA and AIX) to the growing company.andP;  Thisis paralleled by no-one else.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
