They don't run around with machine guns and axes like Ness andhis men while fighting Chicago gangsters like Al Capone and bustingup monshine stills a half-century ago.   And, says Joel Friedman, chief of the federal Organized CrimeStrike Force here: ``Elliot Ness was more a Lone Ranger against theworld, and that's not exactly what we are.''   But they got a lot of satisfaction from the Nov. 19 juryconvictions of mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo and 16 LaCosa Nostra associates on all charges in a racketeering conspiracythat included nine murders, four attempted murders, drug dealing,loan-sharking and illegal gambling.   No sentencing date has been set, but Scarfo and his codefendantsall face possible sentences of 40 to 55 years in prison. Scarfo isalready serving a 14-year sentence for a 1987 extortion andconspiracy conviction.   Lead prosecutor Louis Pichini, 43, a grandson of Italianimmigrants, and his colleagues enjoy it if someone wants to linkthem to Ness.   ``It is a dream come true, especially for an Italian-Amerianworking in organized crime. Everybody has a dream to run for atouchdown, or score the winning run, and this is what I've wantedmost in 15 years as a career prosecutor,'' he said.   ``This is the pinnacle,'' Pichini said. ``I don't think we areever going to get any better than this.''   ``We told the public, just like Ness, that the Mafia, and themystique of the Mafia, is penetrable and we also sent a signal loudand clear to the La Cosa Nostra, and any other other organizedcriminal group, that they can and will be prosecuted,'' said JosephPeters, chief deputy Pennsylvania attorney general assigned to thefederal unit.   What's next?   ``We have to see where the mob is going to go before we know wewill go,'' said Pichini. ``There is a vacuum, a substantial hole inthe mob left by this conviction, but sooner or later the void isgoing to be filled. Then we'll go after them again.''   La Cosa Nostra, or Mafia, first grew in the United States nearthe end of the 19th century, imported from Sicily and southern Italy.   By the late 1920s the gangster era was in full swing, includingthe Philadelphia area, where until Angelo Bruno took control in 1959there were seven bosses and many gang killings.   Bruno reigned until he was shot in 1980. His successor, Philip``Chicken Man'' Testa, was assassinated by a bomb a year later.   Then Scarfo, whom prosecutors called ``a paranoid, cold-bloodedkiller,'' took over and more than a dozen murders followed in thebloody struggle for mob power.   The prosecutors were glad the jurors were protected by keepingtheir names and addresses secret.   A year earlier, Scarfo and other mobsters were acquitted on drugtrafficking charges by a jury that wasn't anonymous. Pichini said hebelieved those jurors were a little frightened and intimidated.   ``Not this jury,'' he said. ``It was an appropriate setting tohear all the charges proved against each defendant. It came backwith convictions for everything. It was as thorough a victory as youcould have against organized crime.''   Friedman, 43, a native of Chicago, said ``the equilibrium hasshifted to the public's favor'' because of a series of successfulprosecutions, ``but whether we can completely eradicate the La CosaNostra is up for debate.''   ``As long as there is greed there will be organized crime,'' hesaid. ``I don't think we will ever have sufficient resources tobring organized crime down to zero.''</TEXT></DOC>
