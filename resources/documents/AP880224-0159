Webster said the proposals would tie a president's hands incases where a premature leak could cost lives, and when a foreignintelligence service with vital information insists that Congressnot be told.   A 48-hour notification requirement would ``promote tension''between Congress and a president ``for years to come,'' Websteradded.   The CIA director told a House Intelligence subcommittee that arecent presidential directive would make certain all but the mostextraordinary covert activities would be promptly reported toCongress.   And in any rare case where the president ordered a delayednotification, a top-level policy group would review the decisionevery 10 days, Webster said.   Some lawmakers have suggested that they might have persuadedReagan not to sell arms to Iran had he notified the intelligencecommittees or congressional leadership of his plans.   Reagan's approval was withheld from Congress for 10 months in1986, until U.S. negotiations with Iran were disclosed by aLebanese publication.   The administration has already lost round one in its battle tomaintain greater discretion on when to notify Congress. The SenateIntelligence Committee voted 13-2 for legislation that includes the48-hour requirement. It is similar in other respects to the Housebill Webster is now trying to derail.   ``A bill which fails to preserve the flexibility and authoritythe president needs to conduct intelligence activities effectivelywill not be acceptable to the president,'' Webster said. He did notsay specifically whether Reagan would veto such a measure.   Current law requires an administration to give the intelligencecommittees or eight top congressional leaders prior notification ofsignificant intelligence activities. But it allows the president todelay in extraordinary circumstances, and issue the notification in``timely fashion.''   In fact, Webster said, there have been only three instances whentimely notification was not given: the Iran-Contra affair, therescue of Americans from Iran who were hidden by Canadian diplomatsand the failed military attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran.   Webster said the Iran-Contra affair, in which profits from thearms sales to Iran were diverted to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua,was caused by ``officials failing to follow existing procedures andrules.''   ``Some allowance must be made for that rare case where a limiteddelay in congressional notification is critical to preserve theabsolute security of an operation when, for example, lives are atstake,'' he contended.   But former Defense Secretary Clark Clifford testified that thelegislation does not go far enough.   He suggested that Congress stop financing any covert activityfor which notification was not given. And he proposed that anygovernment employee who willingly violated the prohibition of fundsbe subject to criminal activity.   ``We are better off without covert activities entirely than withthem out of control,'' said Clifford, who served in the Johnsonadministration.</TEXT></DOC>
