When Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze took the rostrum atthe 43rd U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, he sounded more pacific,pragmatic, and ecologically sensitive than Soviet officials havesounded for years.   Who ever thought of the ozone layer as a major Soviet concern?If one closed his eyes and listened to the English-languagetranslation, one might not have recognized the Kremlin's topforeign policy spokesman.   Shevardnadze proclaimed ``our vision of peaceful coexistence asthe universal principle of international relations.'' Classstruggle in the international arena is out, he said, and ideologyis not a practical basis for conducting international relations.   There was more. The senior Soviet diplomat even spoke of ``holesburned in the ozone layer'' and the greenhouse effect of globalwarming. He lamented acid rain, erosion of the biosphere, dyingseas and fauna. He devoted far more time and passion to``aggression against nature'' than to arms control and long-rangenuclear weapons.   ``We need resources to save our planet, instead of destroyingit,'' he said.   Gone were the litany of U.S.-Soviet problems and irritations,the stark cataloging of world problems, declarations on the MiddleEast.   ``It truly was a revolutionary speech, an important statement ofSoviet philosophy in foreign relations,'' said Iraqi AmbassadorIsmat Kittani, a veteran U.N. diplomat. ``It was especiallysignificant for its tone and style, as well as its content, forwhat was unsaid as well as what was spoken,'' he added.   Kittani and many other U.N. diplomats pointed to Shevardnadze'sreferences to peaceful coexistence, ridding foreign policy ofideology and improved Soviet-U.S. relations which benefit the world.   The extensive references to the environment took many observersby surprise. The urgency of Shevardnadze's tone in addressing theglobe's ecological problems rivaled his past elaborations of thehorrors of nuclear war.   ``Faced with the threat of environmental catastrophe,'' he said,``the dividing lines of the bipolar ideological world are receding.The biosphere recognizes no division into blocs, alliances orsystems.   ``All share the same climatic system, and no one is in aposition to build his own isolated and independent line ofenvironmental defense.''   It is more sensible, he said, to abolish some military programsand channel funds into fighting environmental problems.   Shevardnadze's third speech to the General Assembly since he wasnamed foreign minister emphasized what he called ``new politicalthinking.'' It followed by one day the seventh and last address ofPresident Reagan to the 159-member world body.   Reagan, while repeating his annual lectures on the superiorityof U.S. democracy and free enterprise, also was significantly moreconciliatory than in the past.   In contrast to previous years, he limited his specific criticismof the Soviet Union to passing references to its human rightspractices, and he praised the thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations.   But it was Shevardnadze's speech, devoid of the hard news andheadlines that attract reporters, that showed the most far-reachingreassessments in political thinking, an evolution of the changingSoviet position over the past few years since Mikhail S. Gorbachevtook over as Kremlin leader.   It was a watershed. How far the Soviets have come from theshoe-pounding days of 1960, when Nikita Khrushchev fulminatedagainst the West.   Shevardnadze also repeated his calls for strengthening theUnited Nations. He said that while safeguarding their sovereignty,nations should subordinate some interests to the internationalpurpose of peace and to world forums.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Victoria Graham, a former New Delhi and Beijingbureau chief, covers the United Nations for The Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
