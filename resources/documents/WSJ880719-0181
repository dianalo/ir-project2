Total interest-rate deregulation is rather significant reform. So are state actions authorizing interstate banking and federal actions by Congress and the regulators looking toward doing away with specialized institutions such as banks and savings and loans in favor of &quot;financial supermarkets.&quot;    Contradicting somewhat his &quot;no significant reform&quot; statement, Mr. Niskanen writes, &quot;Some change in the deposit insurance system or a major restructuring of financial institutions, for example, is probably necessary to sustain the deregulation of commercial and savings banks.&quot; But he has his priorities wrong. Maintaining a safe and sound financial system is an end in itself. Deregulation isn't. A key ingredient to maintaining such a system is deposit insurance.    Deposit insurance protects savers' funds and prevents runs on banks and Sandamp;Ls. Interest-rate deregulation, combined with deposit insurance, has led to the Sandamp;L abuses and problems that have brought the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. close to insolvency. The remedy lies not in weakening deposit insurance, but rather in new regulatory actions preventing the highfliers from abusing the system.    Another key ingredient is the Federal Reserve's role in providing liquidity to the banking system to ensure that the banking system provides liquidity to the securities industry on days like Oct. 19 when markets crash. This component of the safety net recognizes that banks are indeed special. The retailing industry, the steel industry and the oil industry, for example, have no similar safety net. But, then, the failure of a large retailing or industrial firm, unlike the failure of a large bank, does not threaten our financial system or our overall economy.    Deregulation via the promotion of new combinations of financial and commercial firms threatens the targeted functioning of this safety net. If the largest bank and the largest automobile firm are allowed to combine and the automobile firm fails (remember Chrysler), it is likely to bring the bank down with it, leaving the Fed or some arm of the Treasury to step in to bail out both at taxpayers' expense. There goes the free-enterprise system.    The safety net of federal deposit insurance, access to the Federal Reserve discount window and a functioning payments system must be maintained. They are essential ingredients of a safe and sound financial system. Deregulation isn't. It is just an ideology.
