Federal and state agencies keep lists of hundreds of endangeredplants, some discovered so recently they haven't been given Latinnames. Yet laws that prohibit even molesting endangered animalsregulate only those plants on public land and the theft or sale ofrare flora.   ``We are pointing our fingers at the developing nations of theworld, saying, `How can you destroy your rain forests,' yet here weare allowing our own plant species to become extinct,'' says JoraYoung, director of stewardship for the Nature Conservancy in Florida.   The lack of concern for plants is ironic, ecologists say, sinceplants have been more useful than have animals. Besides providingmost of the food we eat, they produce morphine, aspirin, digitalis,atropine, alcohol, mustard, menthol, quinine, curare, germicides,pesticides and scores of other useful substances.   ``A lot of plants may not be important now, but they may some daysave lives,'' says Richard Wunderlin, president of the FloridaNative Plant Society.   Florida ranks third in the nation for the number of endangeredplants, behind California and Texas, Wunderlin said. It also boasts,at least for now, many rare species found nowhere else in thecountry, or even the world.   In Florida, the problem is acute. Booming development is wipingout native plant habitats from the hardwood hammocks in the tropicalKeys to scrub land in central Florida and pine woods along theApalachicola River.   The state has created an Endangered Plant Advisory Council, butits powers are limited to placing species on a list that merelyregulates their sale.   ``We're adding more plants to the list all the time,'' sayscouncil Chairman Dan Austin, a botany professor at Florida AtlanticUniversity in Boca Raton. ``But it doesn't protect the plants.People can do just about anything they want, and nobody outside canstop them.''   Many environmentalists have given up on crowded southeasternFlorida. Austin said only 1 percent of the native scrub land in PalmBeach County still survives; in Broward County it has all butdisappeared. The main battleground is now central Florida, whererare plant species are succumbing not only to development but to thespread of the citrus industry.   Wunderlin points in frustration to a newly discovered species ofthe rattlebox plant that is so new it doesn't even have a scientificname. It is known only in two locations _ both housing developmentsnear Avon Park.   ``The species is disappearing lot by lot. We will propose it beput on the federal protective list but it's still on privateproperty, so that won't protect it at all. Each time we go into thefields, more have disappeared.''   The federal government lists only 27 plants for protection.Plants on the list can't be destroyed if they are found on afederally funded project such as a dam or public housing. But thatrepresents a tiny fraction of the development in most areas, Austinsaid. The state does not have any similar prohibitions for the 139endangered and 280 threatened plants on its list.   Placing a plant on the list isn't always easy because developmentand farm interests routinely oppose such efforts, Austin said. Italso gives landowners who find endangered plants on property theyintend to develop an incentive to destroy them quickly to avoidlater headaches. That's perfectly legal.   ``If you're a developer and you own the last population of thebig pine partridge pea, you can bulldoze it,'' said Ms. Young. ``Aslong as you don't steal if from a federal preserve or try to sellit, you're OK.''   Plants have historically gotten short shrift. Under old Englishlaw, animals, which moved through the property of many people,belonged to the crown, making them in effect a public trust. Butplants remained on one spot and were totally the property of thelandowner.   And people, being animals themselves, are subject to what Ms.Young called ``the Bambi syndrome.''   ``If I talk about the impending extinction of the Key deer,people say, `Oh, that's terrible. What can we do,'' she said. ``Butif I say, `This little mint that occurs only in two places on theLake Wales Ridge is very close to extinction,' they just shrug andsay, `That's too bad.'''   That prejudice, she said, is not based on reality. Besides theirvalue to humans, lower plants are often food for higher animals, andtheir destruction can have unknown implications on the environment.   Although state officials and environmentalists see little hopefor a sudden broad shift in the legal and political climate, thereare some hopeful signs.   Dade County has begun to protect some native trees, althoughwithout protecting the habitat they need to survive, said JuliaMorton, a University of Miami biologist. ``It's only quantitative,dealing with numbers.''   Another alternative Ms. Morton found hopeful is transplantingrare species to exotic plant nurseries, if the developing landowneragrees.   That approach, while often the only realistic one, is inadequate,Wunderlin said. ``In the wild they are very variable genetically. Byremoving only a few plants and cultivating them, you are preservingonly a very small proportion.''   If they are reintroduced they can't resist extreme conditions, headded.   Environentalists and experts unanimously praised the NatureConservancy, which has bought 400,000 acres of environmentallysensitive land around Florida over the last 25 years. It often actsas an agent for the state, quickly buying the land and then holdingit until the state bureaucracy is ready to buy it.   The Conservancy recently bought a site along the ApalachicolaRiver that is the last refuge of an endangered evergreen tree. Ithas preserved ancient dunes in the Lake Wales Ridge area that arethe only known home of endangered species such as the scrub plum andthe pygmy fringe tree. And it is buying hammock areas on Key Largothat harbor a variety of tree and plant species.   Despite an increase in environmental consciousness, Austin said,protecting animals while ignoring plants is ``like a watchmakertaking a watch apart and throwing half the pieces away then tryingto put it back together.''   Each day, environmentalists say, more pieces of the watch aredisappearing.</TEXT></DOC>
