Theprofessional leader.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  STARS WAIT IN THE WINGS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Rotisserie Report  </MEMO><TEXT>     The answer is Dean William Palmer of the Oklahoma City 89ers. He's theirthird baseman, a right-handed batter, and, going into Wednesday's game againstTidewater, he was hitting .324 with 14 homers and 37 RBIs in 35 games.;   Right, the next question that rotisserie and fantasy owners need answered iswhen Palmer will arrive in the majors. The answer, apparently, is that he'snot close.;    The 89ers are the Triple-A affiliate of the Texas Rangers,whose third baseman, Steve Buechele, homered Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday (nogame Monday). Buechele also was hitting over .290 going into Wednesday's gameagainst Minnesota.;    Spokesmen for the Rangers and 89ers said Wednesday thatthere is little likelihood of Palmer's being called up unless he's going toplay regularly. And for the time being, given Buechele's performance and thehot start of right-handed designated hitter Brian Downing, there's no lineupspot for Palmer.;    The No. 2 home-run man in pro baseball, as of Wednesdayafternoon, also was a minor leaguer: Luis Medina of the Cleveland Indians'Pacific Coast League (Triple-A) team, the Colorado Springs Sky Sox. Medina had12, one more than major league leader Dave Henderson of the A's.;    Some ofMedina's other numbers: .323 average, 39 RBIs in 36 games and 22 walks.;    Inthe International League, also Triple-A, Phil Plantier of Pawtucket (BostonRed Sox) went into Wednesday with nine homers. Plantier, who hit 33 homers forthe same team last season, is the player whom Bill James has predicted, inadmittedly off-handed fashion, as the major leagues' leading home-run hitterof the 1990s.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mike Antonucci column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910523  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  297  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 23, 199100144262,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
