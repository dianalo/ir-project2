Friday, assistant administrator of theNational Weather Service (NWS).andM;Friday spoke at a recent Association for Computing Machinery conference inWashington.andM;The weather service's National Meteorological Center in Camp Springs, Md.,andO;uses a Control Data Corp. (CDC) Cyber 205 computer for all its scientificprocessing, but it needs an increase in computing power, Friday said.andM;&quot;We're getting the Cray mainly because CDC has gotten out of thesupercomputer business,&quot; he said.andM;With the Cray, NWS scientists can calculate equations better and faster,Friday said.andM;&quot;As we increase the computational capability we are better able to present arealistic model of the weather,&quot; Friday said.andM;As the NWS introduced other computers over the years, the accuracy of theagency's numerical models continued to improve, &quot;and we expect anotherincrease with the Cray,&quot; he said.andM;Even with the computational power increases and technological improvements,&quot;there is still some art left in the [weather forecasting] process, but as wecontinue to improve on the technology there'll be more science and less art,&quot;Friday said.andM;In this regard, he also said the NWS is looking at introducing expert systemstechnology into the national weather forecasting and monitoring process.andM;&quot;We'll use expert systems to bring to bear some of the knowledge we have inforecasting weather patterns across the country,&quot; he said.andM;Meteorologists in certain parts of the country may be adept at forecastingweather in their areas but less familiar with weather patterns in otherareas.andP;  An expert system could capture this region-specific knowledge, Fridaysaid.andM;&quot;I'm thinking of an inference engine or knowledge-based system based on the[weather forecasting] rules we have learned over the years.andP;  We are in theprocess of trying to pick out some areas as well as some of our best expertsto try to generate some sort of knowledge base,&quot; Friday said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
