Cheer Number One: To the Appellate Division of the NewYork State Supreme Court, which last week overruled a lowercourt's ban on the publication of a book by a former memberof the Israeli intelligence service.</LP><TEXT>   Israel had claimed that the safety of its intelligenceagents would be endangered by the publication of &quot;By Way ofDeception: A Devastating Insider's Portrait of the Mossad.&quot;Michael Dontzin, a New York judge, agreed, and he temporarilyblocked publication of the book in the United States.   That was just an awful ruling.   The glory of democracy is that anyone can say anything.Sometimes, those things that are said are lies. Sometimesthey're evil. Sometimes they hurt people. Sometimes they'reobscene. Sometimes they're inane.   But never, never in this land can anyone stop us inadvance from saying what we want.   That was established in 1931 when the court ruled that JayNear, a bigot and extortionist who ran a sleazy newspaper inMinnesota, couldn't be barred from writing what he thought.That doctrine prohibiting so-called prior restraints of thepress was reaffirmed decades later in the Pentagon Paperscases.   And last week it was reaffirmed again. I have no ideawhether Victor Ostrovsky, the former Israeli spy, is a goodguy or a bad guy. But that makes no difference. For, asJustice Felix Frankfurter wrote in 1950, &quot;It is a fairsummary of history to say that the safeguards of liberty havefrequently been forged in controversies involving not verynice people.&quot;   Cheer Number Two: To the Judicial Conference, which is thepolicy-making body of the federal court system.   Last week, the Judicial Conference voted to allow camerasinto federal courtrooms. It's just a three-year experiment.It's just in six district courts and two appellate courts.And it's just for civil trials. But, still, it's good news.   The hallmark of democracy is openness. But for 50 years,the federal court system has barred cameras and broadcastingequipment from its courtrooms. In the past 10 years, morethan 40 states have opened their own courts to cameras, andthat has been informative and instructive. Sure, TV stationsgo in and pick out the dramatic confrontation, the tellingsound bite. But they also show longer segments, theyfamiliarize Americans with the system, and they showdemocracy at work.   Our judicial system is, after all, the real people'scourt. But few people have the time or inclination actuallyto visit a court just to watch a trial. Now we can do that onTV, we can see how our people's court outshines &quot;The People'sCourt.&quot;   Cheer Number Three: To Glenn E. Pille, a state districtjudge in Des Moines. He ruled that my friend Gil Cranberg isa journalist and that the county attorney should quit messingaround with him.   Gil Cranberg is the retired editor of the editorial pagesof the Des Moines Register, and he kept his sense of outrage-- a must for any good editorial writer -- after he retired.One thing he was outraged about was a race track built nearDes Moines with money that was backed by the county withoutany votes of the people, so he continued to write about itfor the Register. The county people and the race-track peoplethink Mr. Cranberg is a nag and they're especially defensiveabout the deal because the race track has been finishing outof the money ever since it opened. Mr. Cranberg points thisout with a certain regularity, maybe even a little glee.   On Aug. 14, the county subpoenaed Mr. Cranberg and toldhim to bring all documents he had regarding absolutely anymatter relative to the Prairie Meadows track. The subpoenawas tangential to a class-action lawsuit about the track, alawsuit that Mr. Cranberg is not involved in except as aresident of the county.   The subpoena was clearly just harassment, and it worked:it messed up Mr. Cranberg's life and work, causing him todevote precious time to fighting the subpoena and pre-emptinghim from gathering any more information on the track becauseof the fear he would have to disclose sources and hand overdocuments and notes.   But last Thursday, Judge Pille saw through the wholething.   He quashed the subpoena and re-iterated the role of a freepress. It was quick justice.   The country is a little better off today because of theappellate decision in New York, the vote of the JudicialConference, and the ruling by Judge Pille.   The press can be jerks, but that's not the point. Thepoint was made 20 years ago by federal Judge Murray Gurfeinwhen the government tried to stop newspapers from printingthe Pentagon Papers.   &quot;The security of the Nation is not at the ramparts alone,&quot;he wrote. &quot;Security also lies in the value of our freeinstitutions. A cantankerous press, an obstinate press, aubiquitous press must be suffered by those in authority inorder to preserve the even greater values of freedom ofexpression and the right of the people to know. . . . Theseare troubled times. There is no greater safety valve fordiscontent and cynicism about the affairs of Government thanfreedom of expression in any form.&quot;   ---   Mr. Gartner is editor and co-owner of the Daily Tribune inAmes, Iowa, and president of NBC News in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
