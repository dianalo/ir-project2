L. 99-145,November 8, 1985), as amended by Section 3131 of the National Defense AuthorizationAct for Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (Pub. L. 100-180, December 4, 1987)and section 305(a) of the Act titled ``Making Further Continuing AppropriationsFor the Fiscal Year Ending September 30, 1988'' (Pub. L. 100-202, December22, 1987). The proposed DEAR amendments apply to all Department of Energy(hereinafter ``DOE'' or ``the Department'') management and operating (Mandamp;O)contractors, including DOE's national laboratories. These regulations areintended to provide the following clarification: under Mandamp;O contracts,the costs of self-initiated contractor legislative liaison activities toinfluence (directly or indirectly) legislative action on any matter pendingbefore Congress or a State legislature are unallowable lobbying costs.The cost however, of providing information or expert advice of a factual,technical, or scientific nature, with respect to topics directly relatedto contract performance or proposed legislation in response to a requestfrom Members of Congress or State legislatures, and their staff members,continues to be an allowable contract cost, irrespective of whether suchinformation or advice was requested or supplied through the DOE.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>The requirements of this amended regulation areeffective, retroactively, as of January 14, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2><ITAG tagnum="15">Rudolph J.

L. 99-145 provided that costs incurred to influence(directly or indirectly) legislative action on any matter pending beforeCongress or a State legislature are not allowable contract costs. The DOE'soriginal implementation of this statutory cost prohibition on contractorlobbying activities involved two steps.Prior to enactment of section 1534(a)(2), the contract clauses at DEAR970.5204-13, Allowable costs and fixed-fee (CPFF management andamp; operatingcontracts), and 970.5204-14, Allowable costs and fixed-fee (support contracts),specified that lobbying costs were unallowable. A decision was made thatthe existing lobbying cost prohibition found at DEAR 970.5204-13(a)(31)and 970.5204-14(e)(29) would be retained as written. Hence, the referenced-contractclauses required to be included in Mandamp;O contracts were not amended.The DOE determined, however, that the existing cost principle criteria(DEAR 970.3102-7, Lobbying costs, effective 4-1-84) used by ContractingOfficers for determining allowability of Mandamp;O contractor legislativeliaison costs required amendment for consistency with congressional intent.In the applicable conference reports, Congress directed that DOE's regulationsbe consistent, to the maximum extent practicable, with the regulationspromulgated by the Secretary of Defense, e.g., S. Rep. No. 118, 99th Congress,1st Session, 515 (1985). Accordingly, DOE promulgated a completely revisedset of lobbying cost principles predicated primarily upon the regulationsapplicable to DOD contracts contained at Federal Acquisition Regulation(FAR) 31.205-22, Legislative lobbying costs, with certain DOE modifications,as a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 7471, Mar. 4, 1986).In response to the ensuing public comments and Congressional correspondence,the Department substantially revised the proposed lobbying cost principlecriteria, as explained in the final rule published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 1603, Jan. 14, 1987). As then amended,the Department's cost principles governing Mandamp;O contractor lobbyingcosts generally provided that the cost of monitoring legislative proceedingsand the cost of responding to Congressional requests for information wereallowable, but the cost of activities intended to influence legislationwere unallowable. Based on Senate recommendations, the proposed cost principlewas revised to contain provisos specifying: (1) The cost of providing requestedinformation to Congress or State legislatures would be allowable if thecontractor concurrently provided the DOE with the information suppliedto Congress; and (2) requests requiring contractor travel were to be processedthrough the DOE.Pursuant to the Conference Report (H. Rep. No. 446, 100th Congress, 1stSession, 941 (1987) applicable to section 3131 of Pub. L. 100-180) andsection 305(a) of Pub. L. 100-202, the DOE was directed to delete thesecost provisos from its implementing regulation. A brief description ofthe DEAR amendments being promulgated today follows:Under DEAR Subpart 970.31 <T3>et. seq., </T3>entitled ``Contract Costs Principles and Procedures,''DOE's cost principle criteria, policies and procedures previously specifiedin DEAR subsection 970.3102-7, are now incorporated in a new contract clauseentitled ``Legislative Lobbying Cost Prohibition'' at DEAR 970.5204-17,as further described below. As amended, DEAR subsecction 970.3102-7 containsguidance on the use of the new clause. Also, DEAR section 970.3103, Contractclauses, has been amended to prescribe mandatory use of the new clausein all Mandamp;O contracts.Under DEAR Subpart 970.52, entitled ``Contract Clauses for Management andOperating Contracts,'' subsections 970.5204-13 and 970.5204-14 are amendedto incorporate particular language clarifications and additions necessaryto implement the cost prohibitions at section 1534(a)(2) of Pub. L. 99-145,as amended by section 3131 of Pub. L. 100-180 and section 305(a) of Pub.L. 100-202.  Also, DEAR subsection 970.5204-17, Legislative lobbying cost prohibition,is added as a new contract clause. It incorporates the cost principle criteriapreviously contained in subsection 970.3102-7, as amended for consistencywith sections 3131 and 305(a) of Pub. L. 100-180 and 100-202, respectively.DOE's intent is to incorporate the definitive cost principle criteria applicableto legislative liaison activities being promulgated today into all DOEMandamp;O contract awards or modifications as if that criteria had been includedin the regulations promulgated on January 14, 1987.  <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Procedural Requirements  </ITAG><T3>A. Review Under Executive Order 12291  </T3>In accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193,February 27, 1981), this rulemaking has been reviewed by DOE. DOE has concludedthat the rule is not a ``major rule'' because its promulgation will notresult in (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more,(2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions, or(3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States based enterprisesto compete in domestic or export markets. DOE submitted the rule to theOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. The OMB concluded itsreview.  <T3>B. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act  </T3>This rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub.L. 96-354. The Act requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysisfor any rule which is likely to have significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. This rule will have no impact on interest rates,tax policies or liabilities, the costs of goods or services or other directeconomic factors. It will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. Therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysishas been prepared.  <T3>C. Paperwork Reduction Act  </T3>No information collection and record keeping requirements are imposed bythis rule.  <T3>D. National Environmental Policy Act  </T3>DOE has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not represent amajor Federal action having significant impact on the human environmentunder the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 432<T3>et seq., </T3>1976), or the Council on Environmental Quality regulations(40 CFR Part 1020). Consequently, neither an environmental impact statementnor an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA are required.  <T3>E. Public Hearing  </T3>The Department has concluded that this rule does not involve a substantialissue of fact or law and that the proposed rule should not have a substantialimpact on the nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses.Therefore, pursuant to Pub. L. 95-91, the DOE Organization Act, the Departmentdid not plan to hold a public hearing on this rule.  <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comments  </ITAG>This final rule is based on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) publishedby DOE in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on Mar. 7, 1988 (53 FR 7318) and pursuant towhich public comments were invited for the 30-day period ending April 6,1988. Public comments were received from three universities. The publiccomments and suggestions to the NOPR, and a description of DOE action takenin response thereto, are summarized in the paragraphs that follow:  <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter questioned the propriety of applicationof the proposed rule to all Mandamp;O contracts as opposed to ``covered contracts''as defined in section 1534 of Pub. L. 99-145.  <T3>Response: </T3>In the Department's original implementation of section1534 cost prohibitions, the issue of applicability was discussed at lengthin the DOE final rule under the subject heading ``Comments Regarding Applicabilityof Section 1534'' (52 FR 1603; Jan. 14, 1987. At that time, the DOE determinedthat the statutory cost prohibitions were generally unallowable under longstandingDepartmental regulatory provisions for Mandamp;O contracts. It was decidedthat separate cost principle criteria for ``covered'' and ``non-covered''contracts would not be established. The numerous reasons cited in supportof DOE's decision at that time remain valid. Accordingly, no changes havebeen made to the proposed rule based upon this comment.  <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter submitted three concerns. Those concernshave been summarized by DOE. Each of the summarized concerns, followedby DOE's response, are published below.  (1) <T3>Comment on DEAR subsection 970.3102-7: </T3>Rather than just make across-reference in subsection 970.3102-7 to the new contract clause atsubsection 970.5204-17, it is requested that a presentation of cost principlesand guidance on the use of the prescribed contract clause would be usefuland instructive.  <T3>Response: </T3>Proposed DEAR subsection 970.3102-7 has been revisedto provide guidance on the use of the new clause. As amended, this subsectionnow specifies that the applicable cost principle criteria are containedin the new contract clause at subsection 970.5204-17 and changes to suchcost principle criteria constitute a deviation within the meaning of subsection970.3100-3. In addition, an explicit requirement to incorporate the newcontract clause in all Mandamp;O contracts was established at DEAR subsection970.3103.  (2) <T3>Comment on DEAR subsection 970.5204-17: </T3>The new contract clauseentitled ``Legislative Lobbying Cost'' has been partially revised and isunnecessarily complicated as a consequence of previous partial revisionsthat were made at least twice in recent years. Also, paragraphs (a)(3)and (b)(1) could be combined. The commenter believed the entire clauseshould be rewritten.  <T3>Response: </T3>The DOE published an original set of cost principlecriteria on January 14, 1987, as previously discussed in this final rulemaking.The only significant change promulgated today is the deletion of the twocost principle provisos found by Congress to be objectionable. The DOEdoes not share the commenter's view that paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(1) shouldbe combined into one statement. The cost prohibitions contained in paragraph(a)(3) apply to the cost of contractor initiated legislative liaison activitieswhich are knowingly conducted for purposes of influencing legislation (lobbying).Paragraph (b)(1) applies to requests for information initiated by Membersof Congress or State legislatures and allowability of resultant contractorcosts incurred when responding to such requests. No changes were made tothe proposed rule based upon this comment.(3) <T3>Comment on DEAR subsection 970.5204-17(f): </T3>The commenter objectedto proposed paragraph (f) by alleging that certain allowable activitiesspecified in paragraph (b), when taken together with the requirements ofparagraph (f) for keeping time logs of employee lobbying activity, couldbe interpreted to constitute unallowable lobbying activities. The commenterrecommended that paragraph (f) be eliminated or modified to clarify thatcertain activities specified in (b) would not be considered ``lobbying.''<T3>Response: </T3>In the opinion of the DOE the commenter has taken anunnecessarily narrow interpretation of the proposed language. The intentof proposed paragraph (f) was to specify that the contractor need not createadditional records to support the allowability of claimed costs beyondthose records normally required when employee legislative liaison activitiesconstitute 25 percent or less of an employee's compensated time duringa calendar month. To avoid potential misinterpretations, however, the word``lobbying'' has been replaced with the words ``legislative liaison activities''and the word ``defined'' has been replaced with the word ``delineated.''<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter, a university, stated that it:<ITAG tagnum="21">``* * * applauds the clarification that the costs of providing informationin response to requests from Congress or State legislatures continue tobe allowable and are distinctly different from lobbying costs which areunallowable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Further, we believe the stipulation that time logs, calendars or similarrecords need not be created for the purpose of providing evidence of compliancewith this regulation makes eminent good sense. The implementation of theregulation should save future unproductive bickering over cost disallowances.''</ITAG><T3>Response: </T3>The DOE objective sought to be achieved by incorporatingthe new contract clause at DEAR subsection 970.5204-17 in Mandamp;O contractsis the reduction of potential disagreements. The commenter is cautioned,however, that where an employee's legislative liaison activities representmore than 25 percent of the employee's compensated time during a calendarmonth, time logs or other records, in addition to those normally maintainedto support allowable costs, would be required to support the allowabilityof claimed costs associated with legislative liaison activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Part 970</ITAG>Government procurement.For the reasons outlined in the preamble, Chapter 9 of Title 48 of theCode of Federal Regulations is amended as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on June 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Berton J.
