The bureau said the number of housing units in the country will reach 100 million by the end of March. John Keane, the bureau's director, called that &quot;a record of historical significance.&quot; But in a separate report, the bureau noted that housing costs have risen faster in the 1980s, contributing to a drop in the rate of home ownership over the past six years.    The bureau said the consumer price index rose 17% during 1980-1983, while monthly housing costs rose 26% for homeowners with mortgages and 27% for homeowners without mortgages. Renters fared even worse: The cost of rent and utilities rose 31% in the early 1980s. During 1980-1983, the median value of owner-occupied housing units increased 16% and the sales price of new homes increased 17%.    The decline in the home-ownership rate during the 1980s has been the first drop since the Census Bureau began tracking such figures in 1940. From the 1980 peak of 65.8%, the percentage of units owned or partially owned by at least one occupant fell to a low of 63.5% in the last quarter of 1985. In the last quarter of 1986 the homeownership rate was 63.9%, but census officials said the increase may not be statistically significant.    Arthur F. Young, director of the bureau's housing division, said the home-ownership rate increased just 2.5 percentage points during the 20 years between the 1960 and 1980 censuses. &quot;What has happened in the last six years since 1980 has been a faster falloff than the increase in the previous 20 years,&quot; he said.    Mr. Young pointed to the 1981-82 recession and high interest rates, as well as increased home prices, as reasons for the decline in home ownership.    &quot;There is a lot of housing out there,&quot; Mr. Young said. &quot;The real problem is whether the price fits the market.&quot;    The bureau said the South has led the nation in housing starts since the agency began tracking such information. Housing units tracked by the survey include apartments, mobile homes, and vacation homes, as well as single-family homes. </TEXT></DOC>
