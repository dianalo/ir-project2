(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Like a BridgeandM;The large xBASE/dBASE vendors have recognized the importance of making theirdatabase and program files available on both Macintosh and DOS computers.andO;With the right hardware, Fox Software has even made it possible for Mac andPC users to access files in multi-user mode.andM;As wonderful as these advances are, there's still a fundamental difference inmedia format between DOS and Mac computers that gets in the way when filesneed to be transferred from one machine to the other.andP;  It's fortunate that,like most problems we face, this one is easily overcome with simple tools anda bit of know-how.andP;  The following is a lsit of the most popular andsuccessful file transfer tools available.andM;Apple SuperDriveandM;SuperDrives can read DOS formats directly.andP;  These 3.5-inch 1.44M floppy drivecomes with every Mac made since the SE/30 and IIcx shipped.andP;  there are twoways to use SuperDrives.andP;  The first is to insert a DOS disk while the AppleFile Exchange (AFE) applicaton--included with the Macintosh systemsoftware--is running.andP;  AFE has a whole series of translation options for wordprocessors, DIF, SYKL, and more.andP;  The second way to take advantage ofSuperDrives is to mount a DOS disk using software from Dayna Communicatons(see the next section on external drives).andM;External drivesandM;The Dayna File is a 5.25-inch DOS disk drive that plugs into the SCSI port ona Macintosh.andP;  It comes with software that mounts inserted floppy disks asthough they were native Mac disks by transparent media translation.andP;  LikeMacLink and AFE, the DaynaFile can be used as document translation tool usingstandard translators.andP;  Dayna Communications developed and licensed much ofNovell's MAcintosh technology.andP;  And for Apple SuperDrive users, Dayna sells$89.95 program called DOS Mounter, which mounts DOS disks in the internal3.5-inch Apple SuperDrive as though they were Mac disks.andM;Major networksandM;Novell's NetWare version 2.15, running with a Mac Value Added Process (VAP).andO;let's you move files between Macs and PCs with simple COPY commands andallows network users to share data in real-time.andP;  (VAPs in 2.15 let you addcapabilities to the network through an API.)andP;  Transfers and translations aretransparent processes in a properly configured Novell network.andP;  If you don'thave Novell or similar network, or if your company has one but you don't havesufficient priveleges to share disk volumes, this solution isn't for you.andM;3Com networks provide Mac support much like Novell's albeit through aproprietary &quot;PCish&quot; protocol and interface.andM;Apple Computer's AppleShare is available for DOS computers.andP;  It reverses3Com's solution--it makes PC speak in Apple rpotocol.andP;  It also uses too muchmemory.andM;Novell is my choice because it uses standards.andP;  It talks to Macintosh via theApple File Protocol (AFP) and DOS machines via NetBOIS and Novell's popularIPX and SPX.andM;Serial transfer linksandM;MacLink Plus, from Data Viz, and LApLink Mac, from Travelling Software, areprobably the most practical ways to transfer files, because they'reinexpensive and use communicatons ports available in eveyr PC and Macintosh.andO;MacLink Plus (the one I use) comes with a serial cable and software for bothsides.andP;  MacLink Plus' tranlators were adopted by Apple for use with AppleFile Exchange and SuperDrives.andP;  This means that you can use translatorupdates from DataViz, MacLink's publisher, or from Apple Computer whenever anew version of system software is released.andM;Peer-to-peer linksandM;Network Bundles for DOS and Macintosh are products from Sitka, a SunMicrosystems company formerly named TOPS.andP;  Each machine with the NetworkBundle is a part of a powerful peer-to-peer network that's most practical insmaller installations that share resources daily.andP;  The Network Bundleincludes printer sharing, e-mail, and disk sharing--all in one package.andO;Anyone can be a &quot;server,&quot; sharing folders on their disk, or a &quot;client.&quot;andP;  Onceinstalled, the Network Bundle is almost as easy to use as NetWare, and, likeNetWare, it transfers and translates files simultaneously.andM;Translation issuesandM;DBF, IDX, NDX, FRM, and DBT files don't need any translation to work on bothPCs and Macintosh computers.andP;  FoxBASE+/Mac reads NDX file headers when a SETINDEX TO [is less than]filename[is greater than] command appears in code andits IDX type when the file name can't be found.andP;  Also--when it'sreleased--AshtonTate's dBASE IV Runtime Plus for the Macintosh will read andmaintain NDX files.andM;Line feedsandM;Unlike data files, PRG and FMT files have a catch; on PCs, a line feed (LF)and Enter mark the end of each line of text, whereas Macintoshes use onlyEnter.andP;  So you need minimal text translation to strip or add LFs when movingthese files.andP;  I frequently use Maclink Plus' TAB TEXT option because it takescare of LFs and preserves tabs for indents.andP;  FoxBASE+/Mac and FoxPRo have anadd/remove line feed option in their Edit/Preferences dialog to do this whilesaving any text file.andM;IconsandM;Mac files have icons associated with them, PC files don't.andP;  Pc files thathave just been moved to a Mac look anemic compare to regular Mac files whenviewed in the finder.andP;  What's more, it's generally true that you can't launchan application by double-clicking on a document unless that document wasassigned an icon by the application that created it.andP;  To put FoxBASE+/Macicons on newly transferred files, all you have to do is open them fromFoxBASE+/Mac.andP;  After that, data and text documents can launch FoxBASE+/Mac bydouble-clicking on them.andM;Next month I'll continue this discussion by describing the most commonproblems PC xBASE/dBASE programs encounter when you move them toFoxBASE+/Mac--and how to avoid them.andM;Michael Masterson is the principle and owner of Masterson Counsulting, a firmthat specializes in planning, analysis, design, construction, andimplementation of information systems for micrcomputers and local areanetworks.andP;  He is also the president and founder of the Silicon Valley dBASELanguage Group.andP;  He can be contacted at (408) 972-4889.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
