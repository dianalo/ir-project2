Workers</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chinese employees at the United Nationsmust remain within 25 miles of midtown Manhattan when traveling onpersonal business, U.S. officials say, citing national security.   ``It was just a matter of standardizing the policy, adding Chinato a list that includes the Soviet Union and East bloc, Cuba,Afghanistan and the PLO,'' as well as Vietnam, Laos and Libya, saida U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   About 100 Chinese citizens are covered by the regulation, whichtook effect Jan. 26.   The Soviet Union, China and other communist countries applysimilar restrictions to U.S. government workers in their countriesto curb espionage activity.   ``Certain travel restrictions are applied for reasons of nationalsecurity to secretariat and mission personnel from some memberstates,'' said Patricia M. Byrne, a U.S. ambassador to the UnitedNations.   ``In no way, however, is official travel by or on behalf of theUnited Nations affected,'' she said Tuesday.   Miss Byrne was speaking before the Committee on Relations withthe Host Country, answering criticism from the Chinese Mission andfrom U.N. legal advisers.   The United States and China gradually have been tighteningrestrictions on each other's diplomats since 1984, when a U.S.consulate opened in the northeast Chinese city of Shenyang, near theNorth Korean border.   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has repeatedlyprotested such restrictions on U.N. staff members ``solely on thebasis of their nationality.''   U.N. headquarters in New York employs about 13,500 people.</TEXT></DOC>
