 Would he be interested in a project related toworld hunger?andP;  Shaffer couldn't resist.andM;Universal Trans-Continental Corporation (UTC) in New York City has a contractwith the World Food Program to arrange for the shipment of millions of tonsof food to developing nations around the world each year.andP;  The U.S.andO;government donates the food under a program called Food for Peace.andP;  Requestsfor food are forwarded to the Agency for International Development (AID) inWashington, D.C.andP;  and, upon approval, passed onto the Kansas City CommodityOffice (KCCO).andP;  On a monthly basis, the KCCO notifies UTC with the types andamounts of commodities it will be releasing over the next month.andP;  At thatpoint, UTC has one week to arrange for shipment.andP;  UTC has to prepare aRequest for Proposal (RFP) and distribute it to approximately 50 shippingfirms.andP;  UTC may receive as many as 1,500 bids on individual commodityshipments each month.andM;Needless to say, UTC faced a monthly battle simply to meet its deadlines.andM;Shaffer decided that Symantec's Qandamp;A would be the best developmentenvironment.andP;  &quot;I believe in using the right-sized hammer,&quot; says Shaffer.andO;&quot;Cost wasn't a big factor,&quot; he added.andP;  Shaffer has long been impressed withQandamp;A for straightforward applications where flat files are appropriate.andP;  Attrade shows, he's noticed how loyal Qandamp;A fans talk to Symantec developers--notto complain or find work-arounds, but to ask for more.andP;  Symantec hasdelivered, too.andP;  Qandamp;A now has multi-file features like XLOOKUP, which allows asimple multi-table form to be created.andM;Once the tool was selected, design and development only took 12 working days.andO;Shaffer defined three databases (files/tables): RELEASES, with records foreach shipment that has been released by the KCCO; SHIPPERS, with data aboutthe potential bidders; and BIDS, for the details of responses to the RFPs.andM;As soon as UTC gets monthly information about the commodities that will bemade available to Food for Peace, it is entered into the RELEASES database.andM;At that point, an RFP can be generated.andP;  Shaffer used Qandamp;A's macro facility toautomate the process.andP;  Using the data just entered into the RELEASESdatabase, a macro first prepares a report listing the commodities to beshipped, their tonnage, pick-up points, and destinations.andP;  The leftmostcolumn has unique shipping instruction (SI) numbers that correspond to eachcurrent record in the RELEASES database.andP;  The report is sent to a disk file.andM;Then the macro creates another disk file report, this time a simple list ofthe SI numbers.andP;  Bidders use this second report a sa form where they entertheir bids.andM;Finally, the macro activates Qandamp;A's word processor to combine a cover letterwith the two disk reports, and saves the combined document to disk as themonthly RFP.andM;Another macro prepares the RFP for distribution.andP;  Western Union offers aservice that allows clients to upload documents as ASCII files for laterfaxing.andP;  Shaffer's macro creates an ASCII script file that contains UTCsign-on data, the list of fax numbers, and a single copy of the RFP.andM;As bids are received, again usually via fax, they're entered into the BIDSdatabase.andP;  Data entry consists of entering the SI number and the bid details.andO;Qandamp;A's XLOOKUP retrieves data from the RELEASES database for display andinclusion in the BIDS table.andM;When the bid deadline arrives, management reports are generated, with bidssorted according to a variety of criteria.andP;  Cost isn't the only factor: timeof delivery, experience, and mode of shipment might affect the selectionprocess.andP;  UTC personnel have discovered that they don't always rely on thecanned reports Shaffer created; Qandamp;A makes it easy for them to create reportsbased on their own combination of sorting criteria.andM;Information about the awardees or their shipments can be combined throughanother Qandamp;A macro or through the Qandamp;A word processor into a shipment reportthat is faxed to Food for Peace headquarters in Rome.andP;  Shaffer chose to usean Emerald City Systems-developed menu program called Super-Menu (&quot;we give itto our customers free&quot;) for the application's front end.andP;  Each of the Qandamp;Amacros was created as an autostart macro.andP;  Qandamp;A's autostart macros can runautomatically when Qandamp;A is started by adding the macro number to the DOScommand line (e.g., QA -m#) as a switch.andP;  The different menu items (to entermonthly commodity data, prepare the RFP, enter bids, and so on) were set upas menu selections under SuperMenu.andM;Because Qandamp;A is so easy to use, Shaffer reports that UTC staff are venturingout on their own.andP;  &quot;They're using Qandamp;A's Intelligent Assistance to performroutine maintenance and to ha(dle ad hoc queries.andP;  They can type in aquestion like 'What was released last month?'&quot;  Qandamp;A's Intelligent Assistance,which uses natural  language processing, translates the request into a Qandamp;Aquery and generates the answer.andM;Although UTC hasn't found it necessary to have a multiuser version of thesystem, that's always a possibility, says Shaffer.andP;  &quot;Qandamp;A's network version isseamless.&quot;andP;  He wouldn't anticipate any problems making the applicationmultiuser.andP;  And that is food for thought.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
