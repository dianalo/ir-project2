Carlucci said he lifted his July 1 suspensions of nine militaryprograms because a Navy review ``did not indicate that any of thecurrent contracts in the affected programs are tainted.''   The Pentagon is beginning actions to ban two companies and threeindividuals from doing further business with the Defense Department.   Carlucci told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ``ifother official information becomes available during the course ofthe investigation which warrants new concern regarding these orother contracts, the department will evaluate it and take anyappropriate action.''   He outlined actions the Pentagon may take, including rescinding,terminating or suspending contracts, or fining individuals.   The decisions arose from the criminal investigation ofallegations that defense contractors and consultants bribedPentagon officials for contracting details that could be vital inwinning contracts worth billions of dollars.   Carlucci also said he is writing to the chief executives of thetop 200 defense contractors, ``urging them to ensure stringentmanagement controls on the use of consultants and to avoid improperbusiness practices.''   The acquisition system has problems, Carlucci admitted. ``Thereare defects in how America equips its forces,'' he said.   The current investigation is a good reason to correct thoseflaws, he said. ``Even if the probe reveals no more than themisdeeds of a few greedy lawbreakers, I still want to move forwardnow, in cooperation with Congress, to remedy flaws in our system,regardless of whether those flaws are related to the Justiceinvestigation.''   The companies suspended Monday were Varian Continental of Dallasand Acquisition Control of Alexandria, Va. The three individualswere former Navy procurement officer Mark Saunders, consultantThomas E. Muldoon and Varian official Joe Bradley.   Carlucci's July 1 announcement of contract suspensions had comein the wake of congressional calls for strong action. But thesuspensions were surrounded by confusion from the beginning, withPentagon officials unable to say exactly what work was covered andwhen the actions took effect.   Contractors, meanwhile, said they were not formally notified sothey continued to work on the contracts.   The contracts were with Litton Industries, Unisys, TRW, ITT,Continental Electronics, Loral Terracom, Canadian Commercial,Hughes Aircraft and Raytheon Corp.   Charles Bowsher, head of the congressional General AccountingOffice, told the Armed Services Committee on Monday that quickactions should not be undertaken while the criminal investigationis under way.   ``It might be better to let the investigative process work,''said Bowsher. Later, he said, if there are indictments, contractscould be suspended. Should there be convictions, companies andindividuals could then be barred from doing business, he said.   All three men suspended Monday from doing Pentagon business havebeen identified in FBI affidavits as having allegedly traded ininside contract information.   The FBI said Saunders, a former Navy procurement officer who wasconvicted of stock trading on insider Navy information in 1982, wasreceiving inside contract data from George Stone, his Navysuccessor. The bureau said it ``believes that Saunders is payingStone for this information.''   The Navy has begun actions to suspend Stone without pay, thePentagon said Monday.   Bradley is vice president for marketing of Varian Continental;he has been placed on administrative leave. Muldoon is a formerUnisys employee who set up his own consulting firm in Washington.   An FBI affidavit said Muldoon paid Saunders $4,000 out of an$8,000 monthly retainer from Litton Industries in exchange forcontract information.   In his congressional testimony, Bowsher noted that past defensebuildups, during World War II and the Korean War, were alsotarnished by procurement problems.   ``History shows that when too much money is pumped into theacquisition system over a relatively short period of time, we willhave problems,'' he said.   But in contrast to past cases, which generally involvedlower-level people, ``one thing that distinguishes (this case) isit's fairly high up,'' Bowsher said.   ``The thing that discourages me the most is that some verysenior people might be involved,'' he said.   Besides the possible criminal charges, said Bowsher, anotherproblem is likely to arise from the Reagan administration militarybuildup.   ``I think the other shoe will probably fall soon, namely, manybig cost overruns,'' he told the committee.   ``I suspect the Stealth airplane program, the Navy shipbuildingprograms and the other programs which have to be stretched becauseof budget constraints will all result in very large cost increasesthat the Congress will have to finance,'' he said.   ``Stretch out'' refers to a Pentagon practice, adopted whenbudgets are tight, of buying the same number of weapons but doingit over a longer period. Intervening price hikes frequently end upincreasing the overall cost.</TEXT></DOC>
