Richard Neuhaus, director ofthe Center on Religion and Society in New York. ``I do not thinkthis is the beginning of the end. To paraphrase Churchill, `This isthe end of the beginning.'''   Television evangelist Jerry Falwell, founder and chairman ofMoral Majority, announced Sunday that the organization will bedisbanded Aug. 31.   The lobbying group, which raised $69 million and helped electthree Republican administrations since its founding in June 1979,had accomplished its mission of politicizing religiousconservatives, Falwell told a meeting of the Religion NewswritersAssociation.   ``I feel that I have performed the task to which I was called in1979. The religious right is solidly in place, and like thegalvanizing of the black church as a political force a generationago, the religious conservatives in America are now in for theduration,'' he said.   Neuhaus, a Lutheran theologian, said Moral Majority's ability tobring Christian fundamentalists out of an isolationist stance andinto public policy debates was ``a major development of lastingconsequence.''   ``While the work of Moral Majority will go on forever, the MoralMajority organization is no longer needed,'' Falwell said.   An average of 2 million to 3 million people either donated moneyor subscribed to the organization's newspaper over the last decade,according to Mark DeMoss, a spokesman for Falwell.   At its height during the 1984 presidential election, the groupraised $11 million. DeMoss said revenues this year are expected todrop to $3.5 million. The organization has a dozen employees inWashington.   Sociologist Nancy Ammerman said the Moral Majority served animportant function for religious conservatives ``as a kind ofcultural symbol that they were gaining a place in the Americanpolitical scene.''   But the group's passing is ``typical'' of social movements ingeneral that start out with charismatic leaders such as Falwell, butin the long run need individuals on local boards to put policies inplace, she said.   ``I've been seeing a movement over the last three or four yearsaway from the charismatic leader-type phase into the grass-rootsinvolvement phase,'' said Ms. Ammerman, an assistant professor ofthe sociology of religion at Emory University in Atlanta.   Falwell said the disbanding of the Moral Majority is part of hiscontinued withdrawal from politics to devote more time to hisministry at Thomas Road Baptist Church and Liberty University inLynchburg, Va. He resigned as president of Moral Majority inNovember 1987.   Moral Majority's work will be taken over by the lobbying groupsof religious conservatives it helped pave the way for, such as theAmerican Coalition for Traditional Values, Concerned Women forAmerica, the Rutherford Institute, the Freedom Council, and theAmerican Family Association, Falwell said.   Much of the political agenda of the religious right _ includingmaking abortion illegal, allowing tuition tax credits for privateschools and silent prayer in public schools _ remains unfulfilled.   But Falwell credited the Moral Majority with registering``millions'' of voters and leading religious conservatives inelecting Ronald Reagan, defeating a dozen liberal U.S. senators in1980, re-electing Reagan in 1984 and electing Bush last year.   He said the organization also helped place conservative judgesthroughout the federal courts and successfully lobbied forlegislation such as the equal access bill, which permits student-runreligious groups to meet in public schools.</TEXT></DOC>
