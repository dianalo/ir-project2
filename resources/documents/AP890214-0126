The Conservation Reserve Program was included in 1985 farm law asa vehicle for taking 40 million to 45 million acres of highlyerodible land from crop production and planting it into protectivegrass and trees for 10 years.   More than 28 million acres have been enrolled, and AgricultureDepartment officials say further signups will bring the 1990 targetwithin reach.   Overall, the report said, the program ``may generate an estimated$3.5 billion to $4 billion in water quality benefits'' throughreduced water treatment costs, lower sediment removal costs, lessdamage to equipment that uses water, and increased recreationalfishing.   Farming activities generate materials than can be carried intowaterways by runoff, and most agriculturally induced pollution is``non-point source'' in which the specific source cannot beidentified.   These farm-generated pollutants include nutrients from chemicalfertilizers and animal manure, primarily nitrogen and phosphorous;pesticides, sediment, and dissolved minerals and salts, the reportsaid.   ``Sediment washing off cropland and into waterways can fillreservoirs, block navigation channels, interfere with conveyancesystems, harm aquatic plant life and degrade recreationalresources,'' the report said.   Also, it said, pesticides and fertilizers are important to farmproduction but these chemicals can harm plant and animal life. Andif they reach high enough concentrations in drinking water,pesticides and fertilizer nitrates can be harmful to humans.   ``Potential for the CRP to bring about a major reduction in thedischarge of agricultural pollutants into waterways is large,because of the large acreage involved and because only highlyerodible land is eligible to be enrolled,'' the report said.   The study, by the department's Economic Research Service, saidthe estimate of $3.5 billion to $4 billion in water benefits wasbased on an assumption that the full 45 million acres would besigned into the program.</TEXT></DOC>
