(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>INNOVATORS ON BOARD; MASSES STILL WAITINGandM;The OS/2 operating system from Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash., which wasannounced in April 1987, promised many new features: a graphics interface,oodles of main memory and true multitasking capabilities.andM;But the high cost of the IBM PS/2 microcomputer and a lack of applicationshave made OS/2 acceptance less than lightning quick in the mass dataprocessing market.andM;&quot;The migration to OS/2 has been a struggle,&quot; noted Stephen Wood, vicepresident of marketing and development at Asymetrix, a start-up softwarecompany in Bellevue, WAsh.andP;  (Paul Allen, who began Microsoft with WilliamGates, founded Asymetrix.)andM;&quot;Because few applications are available, users are not purchasing theoperating system.andP;  Since users are not buying OS/2, software developers arenot delivering OS/2 applications,&quot; Wood said.andM;OS/2 sales have been well below initial projections.andP;  International DataCorp. (IDC), a Framingham, Mass., market research firm, said that 65,000copies of OS/2 were purchased in 1988.andP;  In comparison, nine million PC-DOSlicenses were sold in that year.andM;The operating system's slow progress has also stalled Microsoft's attempt tobecome a premier supplier of LAN networking software.andP;  The company hoped thatOS/2's local area network component, LAN Manager, would entice softwarecompanies designing distributed applications.andP;  With LAN Manager, Microsoftcould break the strangle-hold that Novell Inc., Provo, Utah, holds on the LANsoftware market.andM;To date, interest in LAN Manager has been minimal, according to analysts andsoftware developers.andP;  Lee Doyle, a senior industry analyst at IDC, estimatedthat only a few thousand LAN Manager licenses were sold in 1988.andP;  &quot;The markethas been slow in responding to Microsoft's new LAN features,&quot; he said.andM;NAMED PIPES, THREADS SUPPORTEDandM;Like the underlying OS/2 operating system, LAN Manager operates in two modes.andO;One mode supports Net-bios, a protocol used on LANs for microcomputers withMicrosoft's MS-DOS operating system.andP;  Netbios, introduced in 1984, wasdesigned for simple networking functions, such as file and print sharing.andM;LAN Manager's second mode features named pipes, a new protocol withsignificant additions, such as security.andM;J.andP;  Scott Haugdahl, a senior technology consultant at Architecture TechnologyCorp. in Minneapolis, said,&quot; Named pipes possesses many featuers that weremissing in previous LAN network operating systems.&quot;andP;  Because the protocolruns on a multitasking operating system, applications may issue commandssimultaneously to network file systems.andP;  This capability, dubbed threads,intrigues some software developers.andM;&quot;With threads, a user may easily work with more than one document,&quot; saidDonna Jeker, director of OEM marketing at DBMs supplier Sybase Inc.,andO;Emeryville, Calif.andP;  &quot;A user can quickly download mainframe information,insert it into a spreadsheet and print it on a plotter.&quot;andM;Despite the benefits, LAN Manager has garnered little interest among softwaredevelopers.andP;  Part of the problem lies in the richness of OS/2.andM;OS/2 PRIORITY LISTSandM;Because the operating system offers many new capabilities, suppliers wereforced to outline priority lists.andP;  &quot;We are releasing our OS/2 products instages,&quot; said Chuck Middleton, the director of OS/2 product development atWordPerfect Corp., Orem, Utah.andP;  &quot;With each successive release, we will takeadvantage of additional new features.&quot;andM;Vendors appear more intrigued by features like Presentation Manager graphicinterface than with LAN Manager.andP;  &quot;Independent software vendors areconcentrating on OS/2's Presentation Manager and have shown little interestin the operating system's communications capabilities,&quot; said John Dunkle, avice president at Workgroup Technology Inc., a consulting firm in Hampton,N.H.andM;Indeed, support for the LAN Manager was at the bottom of some vendors' wishlists.andP;  &quot;We haven't really thought about LAN support yet,&quot; noted Wood atAsymetrix.andM;In fact, several vendors doubt they will ever support LAN Manager.andP;  DavidTerrie, president of Newport Consulting in Scituate, Mass., said, &quot;LANManager is designed for distributed applications.andP;  Many vendors examinedtheir DOS applications and discovered they were not worth distributing.&quot;andM;For example, Keith Lowery, a software engineer at Micrografx Inc., amicrocomputer software supplier in Richardson, Texas, said, &quot;We do not see aneed to add file locking features to our application.andP;  Users do not need tolock up their drawings.&quot;andM;The lack of interest among microcomputer software vendors was unexpected.andO;&quot;We were surprised that we had to convince so many microcomputer softwarevendors that LANs were worthwhile,&quot; said Bruce Jacobsen, a group productmanager for LAN Manager at Microsoft.andP;  &quot;The benefit just seemed so obvious tous.&quot;andM;LANs IN '90s FOR MET LIFEandM;LAN capabilities are also an after-thought for many users working with OS/i.andO;Northwest Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. in Minneapolis is using MicroFocus' Cobol to design new applications.andP;  &quot;We want to offload applicationdevelopment from our IBM mainframe,&quot; explained Karl Krammer, the manager ofdistributed software development at the insurance company.andM;In the first phase of the project, application development will be done onindividual microcomputers.andP;  In the second phase slated for delivery in theearly 1990s, a token-ring network will connect workstations to an IBMmainframe.andM;Many software vendors who are interested in LAN Manager zeroed in onrudimentary capabilities.andP;  &quot;Primarily, we are interested in LAN Manager'sNet-bios features,&quot; stated Joseph Allegra, the vice president of research anddevelopment for application development products at Computer AssociatesInternational Inc. in Princeton, N.J.andP;  &quot;Our product was developed in the DOSworld, and Netbios remains the network protocol that our customers require.&quot;andM;One industry analyst said LAN Manager may gain acceptance in a unique way.andO;Typically, applications drive new technology acceptance.andP;  The most noteworthyexamples are Visicalc, which transformed the Apple II into a bestseller, and1-2-3 from Lotus Development Corp., which spurred sales of the IBM PersonalComputer.andM;Newport Consulting's Terrie predicted that MS-DOS limitations, rather thannew applications, will drive LAN Manager acceptance.andP;  &quot;DOS is simply notpowerful enough to support large networks,&quot; he explained.andM;Despite the limitation, most companies use MS-DOS to support LANs that aregrowing at an exponential rate.andP;  Because the operating system only addresses640 kilobytes of random access memory, the underlying operating system oftenbecomes a network bottleneck.andM;Terrie predicted that many companies will install LAN Manager on a serversimply for better network throughput.andP;  &quot;Many companies will run OS/2 on theirservers and still run MS-DOS applications on their workstations,&quot; hepredicted.andM;dbms suppliers supportiveandM;In contrast, delivery of LAN Manager specific applications will come at amuch slower pace.andP;  &quot;We estimate that 10 LAN Manager specific applications arenow shipping,&quot; Microsoft's Jacobsen said in an interview at press time.andM;A few software market sectors have lined up in support of LAN Manager.andP;  Onegroup is database management system suppliers.andP;  Sybase teamed up withMicrosoft to deliver an SQL server this past April.andP;  Oracle Corp. in Belmot,Calif., and Gupta Technologies Inc. in Menlo Park, Calif., also jumped intothe LAN Manager market.andM;Users of DBMS products are just beginning to develop LAN applications.andP;  Forexample, Fidelity Software Development Co., Boston, purchased a Sybase SQLserver in April 1988.andM;William Neimi, the system manager for distributed applications at Fidelity,said the company has a number of LAN Manager applications slated fordevelopment.andP;  One application is a statistics package that will monitor thelength of time to complete customer inquiries.andM;Fidelity plans to run LAN Manager applications on 800 microcomputersconnected on Ethernet and IBM Token-Ring networks.andM;A second customer, Bridge Information Systems in Milford, Ohio, is designingLAN Manager applications for its financial clients.andP;  The company suppliesonline news and database services to investment brokers.andM;Currently, much of the customer information is stored on Digital EquipmentCorp. VAX systems, according to Stephen Harkness, a project manager at BridgeInformation Systems.andM;The company has a two-phase program for ussing SQL Server.andP;  In the firstphase, microcomputers will access information stored on VAXs.andP;  In the secondphase, information will be stored on an SQL server.andP;  The entire project isslated to be completed by the end of the year.andM;Another area of interest is communications software.andP;  In June 1988, IBMdelivered its OS/2 Extended Edition, which bundled communications anddatabase management software with the OS/2 operating system.andP;  Thecommunications software supported LAN Manager, IBM 3270 terminal emulation,IBM's Logical Unit 6.2 protocol and X.25 connections.andM;In April 1989, Microsoft teamed with Digital Communications Associates Inc.andO;in Alpharetta, Ga., to announce an alternative to OS/2 Extended Edition.andP;  Thegateway, which is scheduled to ship by the end of the year, will also supportIBM 3270, IBM LU 6.2 and asynchronous communications.andM;3Com Corp. in Santa Clara, Calif., has announced a version of its MaxAccessSNA gateway that supports LAN Manager.andP;  This product, scheduled to ship inthe middle of 1990, also works with IBM 3270 and asynchronous communications.andM;LAN gateways represent the fastest growing sector of the IBM 3270 terminalemulation market, according to IDC.andP;  Shipments of LAN gateways grew by 200%in 1988 compared to 10% growth in workstation packages.andM;RANGE OF DELIVERY TIMETABLESandM;Users, analysts and vendors agree that eventually applications that exploitLAN Manager will be delivered.andP;  But the timeframe for delivery varieddramatically.andP;  &quot;A lot of applications will be available by the end of 1989,&quot;stated Lowery of Micrografx.andM;To truly take advantage of LAN Manager, MS-DOS and Netbios applications haveto be rewritten.andP;  Dale Kutnick, the president of Meta Group, a consultingfirm in Westport, Conn., said, &quot;Vendors underestimated the task of designingOS/2 software.andP;  Applications have to be written from scratch and that processrequires at least two years.&quot;andM;LAN Manager has only been shipping since November 1988.andM;Right now, most microcomputer software vendors are concentrating ondelivering Presentation Manager applications.andP;  The transition from an MS-DOScharacter-based interface to OS/2's graphics interface has proven difficultfor many.andP;  Vendors have to protect customer training invenstments in thecharacter-based interface while adding new functions that take advantage ofthe graphics interface.andM;FEW OS/2 DEVELOPMENT TOOLSandM;This problem is compounded because relatively few OS/2 software developmenttools are available.andP;  The Mirrors tool from Micrografx lets vendors portapplications written for Microsoft Windows to Presentation Manager.andO;Additional tools are slated for delivery at the end of 1989.andM;Because much of the design work required for Presentation Manager can be usedto deliver LAN Manager applications, analysts and software suppliers see itas an advantage.andM;Newport Consulting's Terrie estimated that an additional 10% development timeis needed to add LAN Manager features to Presentation Manager applications.andM;During the past summer, Microsoft began a marketing campaign for LAN Managersoftware.andP;  &quot;To date, support for LAN Manager has been a grassroots movement,&quot;explained Microsoft's Jacobsen.andM;The marketing campaign was not targeted at microcomputer software suppliers.andO;&quot;Independent software vendors that wrote applications for Unix and othermultitasking operating systems already understand the benefits ofnetworking,&quot; Jacobsen said.andP;  &quot;They may be more willing to write to OS/2 LANManager than some microcmputer suppliers.&quot;andM;Jacobsen said that 200 LAN Manager software development kits were purchasedsince the summer of 1988.andP;  He predicted that 30 to 40 LAN Managerapplications will be available at the end of the year.andM;Analysts and software vendors expect an increase in applications during 1990and a major surge in the early 1990s.andM;&quot;Usually, theree to five years pass before new technology is widelyaccepted,&quot; Lowery said.andP;  &quot;Microsoft's Windows was a slow seller for a coupleof years.andP;  Now, Microsoft is selling 70,000 copies of Windows each month.andO;The same scenario may hold true for LAN Manager.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
