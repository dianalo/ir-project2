The study, by Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.'s Real Estate ServicesGroup, also found that corporations own more than 60%, or$1.633 trillion, of the $2.655 trillion in commercial andindustrial real estate. A third of the property owned bycorporations is held for investment purposes only, while therest is occupied for business, according to the studyconducted for the Institute of Real Estate Management andreleased yesterday in Chicago.</LP><TEXT>   The study, believed to be the first on the ownership ofproperty in America, does not include agricultural land.   Residential property, valued at $6.122 trillion, is by farthe biggest non-agricultural real estate block in thecountry, and most of it is held by individuals. Of allnon-agricultural real estate, valued at $8.777 trillion,individuals own 58%, corporations control 19.4% andpartnerships hold 11.5%, according to the study.   Foreign investors hold a minuscule 0.05%, or $35.8 billion-- a figure that contradicts popular conceptions thatinternational investors, particularly Japanese, have becomemajor owners of U.S. property. &quot;The misconceptions havearisen as a result of highly publicized purchases of `trophy'properties over the last few years,&quot; said Ivan Faggen,world-wide director of Arthur Andersen's real estateservices.   Of more relevance to American business is the substantialcorporate involvement in real estate, which Mr. Faggenestimated accounts for 25% of the average company's balancesheet. &quot;This real estate is a by-product of their businessesand represents a liability on their balance sheets as well asan asset,&quot; said John Magnuson, president of the Institute forReal Estate Management, an association of property and assetmanagers.   With the overbuilt commercial real estate market expectedto remain stagnant for at least the next five years, Messrs.Faggen and Magnuson said the study highlights the need forowners to protect values through sound property management.   Some of the ownership patterns may change significantly inthe future, the study concluded. One change, it said, will bethe increasing role of pension funds in real estateinvestment. The pensions, which along with financialinstitutions now own 8% of all non-agricultural property,will invest substantially more because their pool ofinvestable funds is expected to grow from the current $2trillion to $3 trillion by the turn of the century, Mr.Faggen said.   Another ownership change will occur in the $40 billion inproperty and assets now controlled by the Resolution TrustCorp., Mr. Faggen said. The RTC will spin off most of thoseproperties back to the private sector, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
