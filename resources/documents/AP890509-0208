(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The mother of an infant whose death waslinked to cocaine abuse during pregnancy has been charged withinvoluntary manslaughter, and the prosecutor defended his actionTuesday against growing criticism.   ``The actions of this office reflect the concern, sometimes theoutrage, of this community that children are born ... at risk, bothat birth and for many years,'' said Winnebago County State'sAttorney Paul Logli.   But medical and social services officials said the charge couldbackfire and prevent cocaine-abusing mothers-to-be from seekinghelp.   ``It's the incorrect approach. You want to develop an atmospherewhere they know they can come into the health-care system and notbe penalized. A punitive approach is not going to benefit thechildren,'' said Dr. Ira J. Chasnoff at Northwestern UniversityMedical School, who has directed studies on the effects of prenatalcocaine use.   ``If the procedure becomes common enough, it could very welldrive these cocaine-abusing mothers underground,'' said spokesmanDave Schneidman of the state Department of Children and FamilyServices. He noted that the state had 1,233 cocaine babies in 1988,90 percent of of them in Cook County, which includes Chicago.   Logli said there had been 27 cocaine-exposed infants since lastsummer in Rockford, Illinois' second-largest city with about150,000 people. That is up from nine the previous year.   He filed the involuntary manslaughter charge Monday againstMelanie Green, 24, later released on $3,500 bond. An autopsy foundthat her baby, Bianca, died two days after birth Feb. 2 of oxygendeprivation linked to cocaine exposure late in the pregnancy.   Ms. Green, who does not yet have an attorney, also was chargedwith delivery of a controlled substance to a minor, Logli said.   Involuntary manslaughter is a felony punishible by two to fiveyears in prison. The prosecutor said Ms. Green could face a 14-yearmaximum penalty if she is convicted of the drug charge. Arraignmentis scheduled May 31, Logli said.   ``Laws that threaten or actually punish women for actions ...during their pregnancy are contrary both to the Constitution andcommon sense,'' said Lynn Paltrow with the American Civil LibertiesUnion's division of reproductive rights in New York.   ``If our society is really concerned about prenatal health care... the last thing they want to do is terrify women away'' fromproper care.   But Logli defended his action.   ``My job as a prosecutor is simply to charge those events whereviolation of the law works toward the harm of others,'' Logli said.``If it spurs some debate in society (that leads to) improvingprenatal care, then it will come to good effect.''   It's the second time this month that a woman in this city hasbeen taken to court for exposing her fetus to cocaine, which cancause numerous health problems including low birth weight, impairedmotor ability, irritability that can hinder learning, strokes andseizures.   On May 1, a judge convicted a juvenile mother of child abuse andneglect for such exposure. The child, who shows no ill effects at 3months, was temporarily removed from its mother's custody.   Those charges were filed ``not to punish the mother but toprotect the child,'' Logli said.   But when a child dies after events that occurred ``while thechild was still in the womb, the law provides protection for thatchild and allows for prosecution of the person who causes thoseevents,'' he said.   In December, a Florida woman was charged with child abuse anddelivery of drug after her child was born addicted to cocaine. Thechild survived. Prosecutors said it was the first such felony drugcase there.   In 1987, a judge in California dismissed a charge of failure toprovide medical care to a child, lodged against a woman whose sonwas born brain damaged and later died. Prosecutors had accused herof ignoring a doctor's advice not to abuse drugs.</TEXT></DOC>
