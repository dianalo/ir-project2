Democrats meanwhile disclosed in Washington that their own big-donor program had raised $4.8 million from wealthy givers, labor unions and corporations during June and July. The Democrats' goal is a $100 million-plus campaign.    The new Republican project is dubbed &quot;Team 100,&quot; and aims initially to raise 100 donations of $100,000 each from wealthy individuals, according to the Republican National Committee's director of communications, Kathryn Murray. She said the remainder would come in gifts of varying sizes.    All would be &quot;soft money,&quot; raised outside the donation limits imposed by federal campaign-financing law and spent in various ways to mobilize GOP voters. The Federal Election Commission has approved various ways of spending such funds that benefit presidential campaigns, but the FEC's liberal rules are being challenged in court by the self-styled citizens lobby Common Cause.    The Team 100 money would be in addition to a previously announced &quot;Victory '88&quot; program designed to raise between $20 million and $25 million for the campaign through state party committees. Combined with $46 million in public funds to be spent directly by George Bush's committee and $8 million in private funds that the party may spend in direct coordination with the Bush campaign, the new big-donor effort raises the GOP's announced spending goal to between $104 million and $129 million.    The Bush campaign's former deputy finance chairman, Fred Bush (no relation), said some $100,000 gifts already have been collected for the Team 100 project. Although he is assisting efforts to raise the money, he said the party will make decisions on spending it. That could be a defense against legal challenges raised by Common Cause, which asserts that such soft-money spending is effectively part of the presidential campaign and therefore illegal.    Spending plans have been spiraling upward as both sides vow not to be outspent. &quot;All we want to do is maintain some semblance of a level playing field with the Democrats,&quot; Fred Bush said.    The see-sawing spending war was touched off weeks ago by Michael Dukakis's chief fund-raiser, Robert Farmer. He also said he wanted a &quot;level playing field,&quot; and was only trying to draw even with anticipated GOP spending.    Mr. Farmer stunned the political community by announcing his intention to raise a total of $50 million in party funds, including much soft money, to be spent in addition to the $46 million in public funds to be spent directly by the Dukakis campaign. Later, party officials said they also would raise as much as $8 million in labor-union donations to aid Democratic candidates, without Gov. Dukakis's involvement.    Neither party has ever raised such colossal war chests for a campaign, and there is considerable uncertainty about whether either can reach their goals. &quot;We don't know what a realistic figure is,&quot; conceded the GOP's Ms. Murray.    In Washington, Democrats voluntarily disclosed an unaudited list of their soft-money donations during June and July, the first of what it promises will be complete periodic listings. The gifts included $100,000 each from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the Machinists union; the National Education Association union; a corporation, Great Western Resources Inc. of Houston, and 13 individuals.    Democrats say much more money is coming in now. &quot;We raise the bulk of our money after the convention,&quot; said a party spokeswoman, Julie Anbender.    Republicans doubt that Democrats will reach the goal set by the Dukakis campaign. &quot;We're very skeptical that Farmer can even come close,&quot; said Ms. Murray. But just in case he can, the Team 100 project &quot;is our response,&quot; she said. </TEXT></DOC>
