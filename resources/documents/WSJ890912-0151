Ferranti, the United Kingdom's third-biggest defense electronics company, halted trading of its stock yesterday to announce the unusual contract review. It called the questioned contracts &quot;of a material size.&quot; It said it plans to adjourn its annual shareholders meeting, scheduled for today, until after the internal audit is completed.    The news added to Ferranti's rapidly mounting woes. A subject of takeover rumors for months, the company recently posted an 18% slump in pretax earnings, to #55.8 million ($85.8 million) in the year ended last March 31. It cited mounting contract costs, competition and high interest rates. Also in recent weeks, it lost an important British military radar contract. And contracting delays by four European governments building a common fighter plane have frustrated Ferranti's hopes for an #800 million-plus contract to supply radar for those planes.    The contract audit may temporarily chase away any potential bidder for Ferranti, valued at #550 million based on yesterday's pre-suspension price of 73.5 pence ($1.13) a share on London's Stock Exchange. &quot;Most people will stay clear of Ferranti&quot; until the extent of the contracting problem is known, said London-based analyst Martin Mabbutt of Nomura Research Institute. The news, he added, confirms recent market fears that a number of Ferranti contracts and contract bids may be running into trouble.    The questioned contracts appeared to be among a handful of large weapons orders received by a unit of the former International Signal andamp; Control Group PLC, an international weapons and electronics contractor with which Ferranti merged last year. The unit, ISC Technologies Ltd. in Hanworth, England, had booked substantial military contracts with Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and China in recent years. London analysts speculated the review focuses on an approximately $450 million ISC contract to supply missiles to the United Arab Emirates.    A Ferranti spokesman confirmed the contract review centers on ISC Technologies, but declined to comment further. Typically, contractors book much of the estimated value of such contracts as an asset, and then credit a portion each year to their earnings -- even though actual cash payments on the contract may lag behind. An earnings charge would result if a company discovered it had overestimated a contract's value and credited too much profit.    With Ferranti mum, London analysts guessed wildly at the size of any earnings charges that might result from the review. Their estimates started at #15 million and exceeded #100 million. </TEXT></DOC>
