<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-15-1009 </DOCNO><TEXT>NORGE-P is a computer code which provides linkage between the assemblylattice physics codes EPRI-CPM, CASMO-1E and PDQ7-E and the nodal simulationcodes SIMULATE-E and NODE-P2 for the purpose of Pressurized Water Reactoranalysis. NORGE-P produces card image files for one-temperature and three-temperaturenodal models. These cards contain tabulated cross-sectional data (forSIMULATE-E) and/or reactivity polynomials (for NODE-P2) as functionsof several operational parameters. The important parameters include exposure,moderator densities, soluble boron and power (Doppler). NORGE-P is runfor each assembly fuel type in the nodal model. NORGE-P also generatescard images containing kinetics data for the SIMTRAN-E computer codewhich links these same assembly lattice physics codes to the RETRAN code.A file for the NTPREP program is also created for use with the NTPREP/NODETRAN/RETRANlinkage or with the ARROTTA code. NORGE-P is written entirely in FORTRAN.13 refs., 8 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
