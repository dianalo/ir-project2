Biden Jr. is many things, but I never thought he could be called an originalist.    Yet the senator from Delaware who so sharply criticized Judge Robert H. Bork's originalist legal philosophy as &quot;out of the mainstream,&quot; now has adopted its principal tenet: When interpreting a legal document, be it a statute, regulation or the Constitution itself, one must abide by what its writers originally intended it to mean.    In this case the document is the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty with the Soviet Union and, by retroactive extension, the 1972 Antiballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty. Sen. Biden is the second-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is reviewing the INF treaty before its consideration by the full Senate.    New language, first proposed by Sen. Biden and added in the form of a &quot;condition of understanding&quot; by the committee this week, constructs an authoritative interpretation of the agreement and prohibits the administration from changing the interpretation without congressional approval. He is joined in this condition by other such converts to originalism as Sens. Christopher Dodd, John Kerry, Paul Simon, Terry Sanford, Brock Adams, Paul Sarbanes, Alan Cranston and Claiborne Pell. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who last year called originalism a &quot;great muddle,&quot; also supported the condition.    The new language instructs this and future administrations that American interpretation of the treaty must be grounded in the treaty's text along with &quot;authoritative representations provided by the executive branch&quot; on the &quot;meaning and legal effect of the text of the treaty.&quot; Sen. Biden telegraphed this week's condition during &quot;Meet the Press&quot; on Jan. 24 when he said: &quot;I think the change that would improve the treaty would be to suggest that the interpretation of the treaty in the future can be based only upon what the administration tells us it means now and what the four corners of the documents say, as opposed to being able to two years later say, or 10 years later, or the next president say, 'Well we thought that the treaty meant the following . . .' even though the Senate voted on something different.&quot;    I've never heard a simpler, more precise example of originalism in practice.    But where is Sen. Biden's religiously held belief in an &quot;evolution&quot; and &quot;expansiveness&quot; of meaning as he asserted in the constitutional debate last autumn? Why has he now adopted an originalist approach, something he described last September as &quot;historically unfounded&quot; and &quot;a provocative philosophy&quot;? Obviously, he came to understand the difficulty of nonoriginalist philosophy: It leads inevitably to chaos. Judge Bork asked Sen. Biden last September, &quot;Privacy to do what, senator? . . . We just do not know what it is.&quot; The senator is now asking the same sort of question -- &quot;What do you mean by INF-range weapons?&quot;    It could be argued that there is no hypocrisy here. The Constitution was intended to be a sweeping document subject to a broader interpretation than our laws and treaties. Passing the fact that to work this argument accepts originalism, it should be remembered that Sen. Biden et al. vehemently argued last fall that Judge Bork should have been more expansive and sensitive in his interpretation of OSHA regulations and civil-rights statutes.    I agree with Sen. Biden; the U.S. should abide by the original meaning of its treaties, and so should the Soviets. The proper course of action should circumstances change, as they have with repeated Soviet violations of the ABM Treaty and may with INF, is to identify infractions, attempt to remedy them, and, if that is impossible, void the agreement. The wrong course -- the one the administration is taking with the ABM Treaty and which is at the heart of Sen. Biden's new-found belief in originalism -- is to argue for &quot;broad&quot; interpretation over a &quot;narrow&quot; one. With contracts of any sort -- be they treaties, laws or constitutions -- it is impossible for society to function in an orderly manner if the parties to those contracts can decide they mean whatever they want them to mean without regard for the original intent of the writers.    I am glad to see that Sen. Biden and some of his colleagues have changed their minds. I guess we're all originalists now.    ---   Mr. Bork is visiting journalism fellow at the Heritage Foundation. </TEXT></DOC>
