(Qandamp;A) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Gasteiger, Daniel.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>Aligned decimalsandM;I print a report of numeric data from in a database and I have two questionsabout the printouts.andP;  First, how do I get data of varying decimal lengths toalign on the decimal point? Second, how do I get decimal values to round tothe nearest even number? For example, I want the value 88.5 to round down to88 and the value 89.5 to round up to 90.andM;Orville L. ConleyandM;Aqualon Co.andM;Louisiana, Mo.andM;The first question is easy.andP;  To align entries on the decimal point, assign aFixed format.andP;  In 1-2-3 select /Range Format Fixed (in Symphony, MENU FormatFixed), enter the number of decimal places you want to display, and indicatethe range of values that you want to align.andM;As to your second question, it isn't clear whether you want to round oddintegers up or down to the next even value.andP;  For example, should 87 round to88 or to 86?andM;The following formula rounds odd values up to the next even value.andP;  Enter itin cell B1 to return the even number nearest in value to the entry in cellA1:andM;(@MOD(@INT(Al),2)andless;andgt;0)+@INT(Al)andM;To round odd values down to the next even value, place a negative sign at thebeginning of the formula:andM;-(@MOD(@INT(A1),2)andless;andgt;0)+@INT(A1)andM;Errant date formatandM;What causes an @SUM formula to in return a date or a decimal? I use severalworksheets repeatedly, erasing old data to make way for new.andP;  When I enterthe formula @SUM(N9..N29) into a cell in column P, it returns JAN-00.andP;  Thecells in range N9..N29 are blank.andM;When I examine the cell contents, the formula is there, but it doesn't appearcorrectly until I assign the cell a decimal format.andP;  I know how to obtain thecorrect result, but I don't know why this happens.andP;  Any ideas?andM;Anni TurnerandM;Canam Steel Corp.andM;Point of Rocks, Md.andM;A.andP;  Apparently, at some point in the past you assigned a Date 3 format to thecell in question.andP;  A cell format is independent of a cell's contents.andO;Erasing a cell's contents doesn't remove the format; it simply empties thecell.andP;  Any future numeric entry will assume the format you assigned to thecell.andM;Eliminate the need to repeatedly reformat cells by reformatting them in theoriginal worksheet, then resaving the worksheet.andP;  Use the Range Format Reset(in Symphony, the Format Reset) command to reformat ranges, When you laterretrieve the worksheet and replace old data with new, your entries shouldappear in the default format,andM;Where's the range format?andM;I've inherited a worksheet that does in something I don't understand.andP;  Someof the cells display values in the Percent 2 format, but the current cellindicator in the control panel doesn't include the (P2) notation.andP;  When Icombine these cells into another worksheet, they lose their formats evenbefore I can calculate the new worksheet.andP;  How can I combine the cells into anew worksheet without losing the Percent 2 formats?andM;Adam RoseandM;Florida HospitalandM;Orlando, Fla.andM;The percent cells in your inherited workin sheet were not assigned a formatvia the Range Format command  in Symphony, the Format command).andP;  That's whythe current cell indicator lacks the (P2) notation.andM;Your worksheet's previous owner set the global format of the worksheet toPercent 2.andP;  When you assign a global format, all numeric entries assume thatformat unless you assign them separate formats by using the Range Formatcommand.andP;  By default, the global format is General, but it can be any of theformats available on the Range Format menu.andM;To set a global format in 1-2-3, select /Worksheet Global Format and choosethe desired format from the resulting menu.andP;  In a Symphony SHEET window,select MENU Settings Format, choose a format, and then select Quit.andM;When you combine worksheets, global formats don't transfer from one worksheetto another.andP;  If you want cell formats to move along with the cells, use theRange Format command.andM;December contest resultsandM;In the December issue, we asked users of 1-2-3 and Symphony to submit thebest method of performing a lookup based on a looked-up label.andP;  We providedthe following example:andM;A          B          CandM;1        1 LowandM;2        2 MedandM;3        3 HighandM;4andM;5 input1              2andM;5 input2              3andM;The solution should use the value in the cell labeled input1 (cell B5) toreturn the name of one of three secondary tables.andP;  Then it should use theappropriate secondary table to look up the value in the cell labeled input2(cell B6).andM;The technique should return a value from the table low, medium, or high,based on the value in cell B6.andP;  The table to use for this lookup should bedetermined by the table name located in range A1..B3, based on the value incell B5.andM;Our readers solved this problem in a variety of ways.andP;  We divided the winningsolutions into three categories.andP;  The formula in Category  1 requires a blankrow above the table in range A1..B3, so we inserted a blank row at row 1.andO;Refer to the following screens for all three categories.andP;  Category #1.andP;  Wereceived many formulas that use the value in cell B6 to return the name ofone of the secondary tables, then look up the value in cell B7 in that table.andO;The shortest formula is:andM;@INDEX(@@(@INDEX(A1..B4,1,B6)),1,B7)andM;To make this formula work, assign the following range names:andM;low B8..C11andM;med B12..C15andM;high B16..C19andM;The syntax of the @INDEX function is @INDEX(range,col,row).andP;  It returns thevalue of the cell in range that is located at the intersection of col androw.andM;The formula @INDEX(A1..B4,1,B6) returns the name of one of the threesecondary tables.andP;  Range is the table of values and labels in range A1..B4.andO;Col is the number of columns from the leftmost column.andP;  In this case, 1represents column B (one column from the left).andP;  Row is the number of rowsfrom the top row.andP;  In this case, the entry in cell B6 represents row 3 (tworows from the top).andP;  So the @INDEX function returns med, which is one columnfrom the left and two rows from the top in range A1..B4.andM;Because the main @INDEX formula doesn't recognize the label returned by theembedded @INDEX formula as a range name, you must use the @@function.andP;  Thisfunction acts as a pointer; it uses the results of the embedded @INDEXformula as a reference to one of the three named ranges.andP;  Without the @@function, the formula @INDEX(@INDEX(A1..B4,1, B6),1,B7) returns ERR.andM;The entire formula returns 180, which is one column from the leftmost columnand three rows from the top in med.andP;  Category #2.andP;  The winning formula inthis category doesn't use the table in range A2..B4.andP;  Instead, it uses the@VLOOKUP function to look up the value in cell B7 in one of the threesecondary tables:andM;@VLOOKUP(B7,@@(@STRING(B6,0)),1)andM;The syntax of the @VLOOKUP function is @VLOOKUP(item,range,col).andP;  Item is thevalue or label you want to look up.andP;  Range is the range of the table in whichitem is located.andP;  Col is the column number where the result is located.andO;Column numbering begins with 0.andM;To apply this formula, assign the following range names:andM;1 B9..C11andM;2 B13..C15andM;3 B17..C19andM;The @STRING formula converts the value in cell B6 to a label.andP;  The @@functionuses the result of this formula to refer to one of the three named ranges.andM;The @VLOOKUP formula uses the entry in cell B7 as the item to look up in thesecond column of the table specified by the entry in cell B6.andP;  Category #3.andO;Winning formulas in this category also bypass the table in range A2..B4.andO;They use a single @INDEX formula that refers directly to range C8..C19.andP;  Theformulas use the values in cells B6 and B7 to calculate the location of theresult.andP;  The shortest formula is:andM;@INDEX(C8..C19,0,B6*4-4andplus;B7)andM;The range argument is range C8..C19, which includes one blank cell plus thevalues in the second column for each of the three secondary tables.andP;  Becauserange is a single column, col is 0.andP;  Row represents the number of rows fromthe top of the range.andP;  Row 8 is row number 0, row 9 is row number 1, and soon.andP;  The row number is calculated by using the values in cells B6 and B7.andO;Because of the spacing of the tables, you need to multiply cell B6 by 4,subtract 4, and add cell B7 to determine the row argument.andP;  For example, whencell B6 contains 2 and cell B7 contains 3, the formula 2.4-4andplus;3 returns 7.andO;Row 15 is seven rows down from row 8.andP;  So this @INDEX formula returns thecorrect result of 180-which is zero columns to the right and seven rows fromthe top of range C8..C19.andM;The following readers submitted winning entries:andM;Rick Cox, Raleigh, N.C.;
