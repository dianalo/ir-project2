It wasn't an act of despair. Rather, it was one of several approaches big U.S. banks are taking to whittle down their exposure to huge Third World loans that may never be repaid.    In one approach -- albeit not the most important -- banks are swapping some of their loans for equity, or investments in businesses in countries that owe them money. In Citicorp's case, its debt-for-equity swap earlier this year left it with a 20% interest in a pulp mill being built in Nacimiento, a hillside town a few hundred miles south of Santiago, Chile's capital.    Enthusiasts say debt-for-equity swaps benefit hard-pressed Latin American borrowers by reducing their interest payments, which now total more than $30 billion a year. Such swaps also boost flagging investment in debtor nations and allow banks to make investments that could gain in value.    The volume of debt-for-equity swaps has surged and will probably total more than $8 billion in 1988, up from an estimated $5 billion to $6 billion last year -- though that doesn't come close to absorbing all the loans banks would like to unload. Commercial banks have lent a total of $238 billion just to Latin America's four largest debtors -- Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela -- and they are eager to get those loans off their balance sheets.    So, in addition to debt-equity swaps, banks are using other means to improve their loan portfolios. These include outright loan sales in the secondary market -- where trading may well top $20 billion this year -- and new securities called &quot;exit bonds,&quot; which allow banks to exchange loans for tradable securities.    Chile is the main testing ground for debt-for-equity swaps. Since 1984, it has reduced its foreign bank credits by $4.2 billion, mainly by exchanging debt for equity investments or for local currency, says the country's youthful finance minister, Hernan Buchi. He adds that the Citicorp transaction, done jointly with Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Scott Paper Co., is the largest debt-equity transaction in Chile so far this year.    Citicorp has either completed or lined up minority investments in gold-mining, pulp, forestry and wood businesses equal to about 20% of its approximately $500 million in loans and investments in Chile, says the bank's senior officer in Santiago, Edward Dreyfuss. Citicorp and other bank investors stress they are passive, minority investors and that they intend eventually to sell their stakes, possibly to their investment partners.    But other debt-troubled countries have been slower to embrace Chile's debt-for-equity approach. The Philippines, and more recently Brazil and Argentina, have begun debt-equity programs. Mexico, however, suspended a similar program, partly because of concern it could be inflationary. Debtor nations also worry that debt-equity swaps allows major companies to fall into foreign hands. Moreover, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board allows banks to take only passive minority stakes in foreign non-financial businesses, and only a few banks have the local offices and knowledge needed to make such investments.    So banks are desperately seeking other ways to reduce their large, shaky Third World loans. A recent Salomon Brothers Inc. study showed that 12 of the largest U.S. banks cut their loans to debt-troubled countries by $5.53 billion, to a total of $46.8 billion in the year ended June 30. Most of this reduction was achieved by selling loans into the secondary market -- where loans can be traded by speculators -- rather than through debt-equity swaps.    Much of the demand in the secondary-loan market comes from multinational companies and domestic investors. They can buy dollar credits to exchange for local currency at bargain rates at the debtor country's central bank. With that local currency they then make their own local investments.    U.S. banks are eager to sell at a discount simply because investors back home are leery of banks with large loans to heavily indebted developing countries. Such credits are frequently rescheduled and in some cases, such as Peru and Bolivia, interest hasn't been paid for years. Until they convince investors that these countries' economies, and thus their borrowings, are on a healthier path, or reduce their Third World debts substantially, many big U.S. banks will have limited access to the U.S. equity market to raise the capital they need for acquisitions and other purposes.    Some banks are resigned to selling their loans at knock-down prices into the secondary market, where Argentine loans this summer sold for as little as 29 cents on the dollar; few Latin debts command prices of more than 50 cents on the dollar.    But many big banks can't afford such huge discounts. Typically, big U.S. banks have loan-loss provisions totaling between 25 cents and 35 cents for each dollar of Third World debt -- not enough to sell at average prices of 40% of face value. Even worse, if the banks all rushed to sell at once, prices would fall further.    Citicorp and some other banks maintain they can get better value by selling and swapping the loans without using the secondary market, which they characterize as a last resort and an illiquid and sporadic bazaar. In the year to June 30, Citicorp says it cut its loans to debt-troubled countries by $2 billion to $12.6 billion at an average discount of 18%. The $12.6 billion total includes equity investments as well as loans. In Chile it has typically converted debt at about 87 cents worth of local currency for each $1 of debt, say officials at the bank's Chilean headquarters.    More recently, efforts are being made to offer banks even better conversion rates. The most promising of these are the &quot;exit bonds&quot; valued at up to $5 billion that Brazil recently offered to its bank creditors, and the agreement which Chile recently negotiated with its bank creditors to allow it to use up to $500 million of its export earnings to buy back foreign debt. Exit bonds are tradable and exchangeable for other investments and allow banks to reduce their loans to a Third World borrower.    A new form of exit bond recently offered allows each creditor bank to exchange up to $15 million of its medium-term loans to the Brazilian government. These Brazilian bearer bonds, which mature in 25 years and carry a fixed interest rate of 6%, may be exchanged for Brazilian Treasury securities or for equity investments and are exempt from Brazilian taxes. The Brazilian Treasury securities also will be hedged against foreign currencies to remove exchange risks.    So while banks were recently gathering a new $5.2 billion bank loan for Brazil, they were simultaneously seeking to reduce their Brazilian loans by as much as $5 billion in exit bonds, and converting additional amounts into equity investments in the country's monthly debt auctions. Thus, Brazil's bank credits won't necessarily increase much this year. And many smaller lending banks -- who dislike making these loans anyway -- now have a way to avoid the periodic loans that banks are forced to make to debt-troubled countries.    ---   Mr. Truell reports on international banking from The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.    ---                       Third World Debt             Heavily indebted developing countries                 (In billions of U.S. dollars)                               Total Foreign Debt                          (percent foreign bank debt)                          ---------------------------                          1983                   1987    Argentina          $46.9 (66%)           $55.0 (73%)    Brazil              93.6 (78)            121.3 (66)    Chile               18.6 (70)             21.3 (62)    Mexico              93.8 (79)            105.7 (78)    Philippines         29.3 (53)             30.5 (51)    Venezuela           37.7 (79)             36.4 (96)   Source: Morgan Guranty Trust Company   ---                          Debt Swaps   Converting foreign bank loans to equity investments began in earnest in 1985.
