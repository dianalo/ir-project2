In the White House residence, Mr. Bush asked DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, to fly to Saudi Arabia. Theirmission: to help the president resolve an agonizing conflictbetween military and diplomatic pressures over when to launcha ground war against Iraq.</LP><TEXT>   The arrival today in Riyadh of the general and thesecretary is a clear sign that after 23 days of war,President Bush has reached a critical -- and unexpected --juncture. In this war, diplomats and political leaders areuncharacteristically pushing for a quick commitment to groundwar. The fight for Kuwait must be finished, they argue,before the U.S. and its Arab allies suffer more damage from arising tide of antipathy and anger in the Arab and Muslimworlds. Just yesterday, French President Francois Mitterrandpredicted that a ground offensive would begin &quot;sometime thismonth.&quot;   On the other side is a military leadership that seeslittle compelling reason to move quickly to a ground fight.Instead, these leaders argue, the U.S. should continuebombing Iraqi military targets for weeks before launching apotentially costly ground offensive.   From Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf on down, battle leaders havetried to clamp down on the urge to commit troops quickly. Asenior Army officer familiar with the thinking of the JointChiefs of Staff is particularly blunt: &quot;There is no militaryargument whatsoever to move quickly into ground combat. None.Nada. Zero.&quot; In Riyadh, a British military briefer whosuggested that ground war was &quot;inevitable&quot; was immediatelycountered by a U.S. general who said it wasn't.   The debate has created what Sen. William Cohen, a MaineRepublican, calls an &quot;exquisite dilemma&quot; for Mr. Bush. It ismade more exquisite by mounting evidence that while the U.S.is enjoying spectacular military successes through its aerialtactics, Saddam Hussein is waging a sly political campaign inwhich he intends to turn the very success of allied bombingraids into a potent tool against the alliance.   While mounting virtually no meaningful military operationsin recent days, Saddam Hussein appears to have embarked on aconscious effort to enhance his own stature and reduce theWest's by portraying the bombing campaign as a despicableattack intended not to liberate Kuwait but to hurt Arabs andMuslims.   Having allowed some journalists to return, Iraq is tryingto maneuver them into reporting almost exclusively on bombdamage to civilian areas. And Iraq's key Arab supporter,Jordan's King Hussein, Wednesday delivered an explosivespeech depicting the bombing campaign as an attack on allArabs and Muslims.   A senior Bush administration official insisted yesterdaythat &quot;there is no great sense of anxiety&quot; about tensions inthe Arab world. Still, Arab diplomats concede privately thatstreet opinion opposing the war already is leading governmentpolicy in Algeria, and Egyptian officials fear a slow erosionof support for their participation in the war effort. Someworry that the beginning of the Islamic holy month ofRamadan, on March 17, could give Saddam Hussein a propagandaopening to whip up more passions if fighting isn't windingdown by then.   &quot;It's not just damage to civilian targets that's atquestion,&quot; says Geoffrey Kemp, a former National SecurityCouncil staffer now at the Carnegie Endowment forInternational Peace. &quot;It's the specter of the high-tech Westdevastating bridges and infrastructure that strikes a rawnerve in a lot of the Third World, especially in the MiddleEast.&quot; Such psychological pressure is among &quot;a lot ofcompelling reasons this ground war will start sooner ratherthan later.&quot;   Humanitarian factors also are pushing Mr. Bush to move onthe ground as food and fuel shortages worsen for the citizensof Kuwait.   Yet there are nagging fears that Saddam Hussein may simplybe trying to goad the U.S. into a ground war -- one that willopen his only opportunity to inflict large numbers ofcasualties. And that, many in Congress and elsewhere argue,is precisely the trap Mr. Bush should avoid.   &quot;My view is that he is trying to engage us in a prolongedground war, and he sees a prolonged ground war as a tacticalsuccess for himself, perhaps leading to a strategic victory,&quot;says former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski.&quot;That means we have to make sure that's precisely what wedon't get into.&quot;   At a closed briefing last week in which lawmakers debatedthe extent of the damage, Rep. Larry Hopkins, a KentuckyRepublican, won applause when he told administration briefersthere was no time limit -- that Congress would wait for bombsto do their damage.   And a big ground campaign would exact a political price ofits own in the Arab and Muslim worlds, according toadministration aides weighing the decision. Allied forcesundoubtedly would begin killing far more Iraqi soldiers,arousing a new set of popular passions.   At its heart, this debate is over when, not whether, tomove to some ground operations. Though some lawmakersmaintain that the U.S. should consider simply continuing theair campaign indefinitely to wear down Iraq, administrationofficials and military leaders say their battle plan clearlycontemplates a ground incursion to recapture Kuwait at somepoint. In one meeting recently, Gen. Powell spoke of wantingto plant a flag in Kuwait City.   But deciding when to make a ground thrust is agonizinglydifficult because of confusion and uncertainty aboutprecisely how far the U.S. has come in softening up Iraqidefenses. The U.S. military's overall goal is to halve Iraq'smilitary capability through air attacks before moving on theground. But deciding when that goal is reached is a trickyjudgment call. And even within the U.S. government there aresplits; military officials are more optimistic thanintelligence analysts, so far.   Incessant bombing runs by the allies have achievedsurprisingly quick success in taking out Iraq's bridges,ammunition dumps, fuel tanks and communications facilities,as well as its ability to produce more chemical andbiological weapons. All those steps reduce Iraq's ability tocounter a big allied ground push.   But at the same time, Iraqi commanders appear to havereacted to the breathtaking allied aerial onslaught bydigging in even deeper inside Kuwait. That means they areimmobilizing their own forces in the sand -- but also makingit hard for U.S. bombers to find or take out Iraqi tanks,armored vehicles and artillery.   As a result, U.S. military planners are hinting at apotential strategy in which the allies don't altogetherswitch from an air to a ground campaign, but rather beginusing extensive ground incursions to support a continuingaerial campaign. Under this approach, they suggest, troops onthe ground are used to flush out Iraqi armored vehicles fromthe trenches so that A-10 attack planes and other aircraftcan attack them from the air.   Though the most compelling arguments for starting thiskind of ground action soon are political, some militaryfactors also eventually will weigh against waiting. Already,U.S. officials assert, Iraq is beginning to move commandcenters and anti-aircraft batteries into civilianneighborhoods to make them harder for the U.S. to hit incoming attacks.   In addition, it will be difficult to keep tens ofthousands of U.S. and allied soldiers at the desert front,primed for battle, for months. Hot weather and sandstormseventually would make ground operations more difficult. Andtens of thousands of reservists will have to be rotated outif the war lasts into the summer. Bombing runs eventuallywill produce diminishing returns, as allied fliers run out ofreasonable targets. Allied forces could become morevulnerable to terrorist attacks in June, when Muslims beginstreaming into Saudi Arabia for the annual Islamic month ofpilgrimage.   It is clear that President Bush will personally sortthrough these arguments and make the decision. So far, heseems inclined to order ground action at some point.   Administration aides say U.S. commanders are following amilitary plan that contemplates a ground phase and that Mr.Bush is reluctant to change that plan unless Gen. Powell andGen. Schwarzkopf clearly recommend doing so. Officials saythe difficulty of deciding when to begin a ground war makesMr. Bush all the more likely to let defense advisers settlethe issue on largely military grounds.   Still, some doubt that political arguments can be shutout. &quot;Militarily, there's no reason ever to do a ground war,&quot;maintains Eliot Cohen, a professor of strategic studies atJohns Hopkins University's School of Advanced InternationalStudies who has argued against a ground war. &quot;The politicalarguments really are and always have been the critical ones.&quot;   ---                         The Air War                                                                                                        Allied air sorties to date                 52,000 Allied air sorties yesterday                2,600 Iraqi planes shot down                         33 Iraqi fighters flown to Iran                  109 Iraqi combat aircraft prior to war            689 Iraqi transport planes flown to Iran           25                                                                                                        Source for prewar data: International Institute forStrategic Studies</TEXT></DOC>
