But the Democrats hope that it is their party, not his,that reaps the dividends.</LP><TEXT>   No matter who is the winner in the blow-up over thisyear's anti-crime bill, crime and punishment are sure to beamong the hottest issues of next year's election season.While philosophical differences on the issues do exist, thefight over the bill has almost everything to do withpolitics.   &quot;There's an awful lot of symbolism,&quot; says Sen. PatrickLeahy (D., Vt.). Neither the pending bill nor the president'soriginal proposal &quot;would do anything to stop crime, butrather {are meant to} look good,&quot; he adds.   &quot;It's the purest of political fun and games,&quot; Sen. AlanSimpson (R., Wyo.).   So far at least, the president seems to be gaining themost. His threat on Monday to veto the bill, accompanied byhis accusation that the Democrats are being soft on crime,halted whatever momentum the legislation once had. It wasdoubtful yesterday that the House would pass the bill, andRepublican senators were planning a filibuster to stop itfrom even coming up in that chamber.   Still, the Democrats considered it a major accomplishmentthat they produced a final bill -- one that they contendedwould be &quot;tough on crime&quot; -- at all. &quot;It used to be thepresident was on the mountain and we were down below&quot; on thecrime issue, says Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.). &quot;For thefirst time, Democrats have shown we are pretty tough too.&quot;   Aside from asserting that the president's criticisms ofthe legislation are untrue, Democrats suggested that the vetothreat is a sign of the president's desperation amidincreasing public disenchantment with his handling ofdomestic issues. &quot;The veto threat has as much to do with thepolitics of the economy as the politics of crime,&quot; saysDemocratic pollster Geoffrey Garin. &quot;Bush is reduced to oneargument -- that Congress can't get the job done -- and thepoint is starting to ring a little hollow.&quot;   The bill itself is a hodgepodge of provisions that aremeant to appease both the political left and right. Forliberals, there is a provision requiring a five-day waitingperiod for people purchasing handguns. For conservatives, thedeath penalty would be applied to more than 50 crimes,ranging from political assassination to hijacking.   The legislation doesn't give President Bush exactly whathe sought. It would set stricter limits on the number ofappeals that state inmates can make to the federal courts andcodify a Supreme Court precedent giving police more leeway touse evidence obtained in improper searches. But neitherprovision would go as far as Mr. Bush wanted.   So the president seized the bill as an opportunity to bashthe Democrats as being weak on crime. &quot;It just fell into hishands,&quot; says GOP political consultant Eddie Mahe.   The message that Democrats are soft on crime has areceptive audience. &quot;Historically, Republicans havesignificant margins on this issue,&quot; says GOP pollster NeilNewhouse. &quot;That's not a bad argument to make; voters would belikely to believe it.&quot;   And Republicans are betting that if Congress fails to acton the bill, that, too, will work to their advantage,bolstering their argument that Congress is blocking thepresident's program. Crime legislation was one of only twobills that the president asked lawmakers to pass this year.   The veto threat could help Mr. Bush solidify his politicalbase. The National Rifle Association, for instance, isespecially pleased with his action. It tried yesterday, alongwith the Justice Department, to muster last-minute oppositionin the House by warning that the language providing for awaiting period on gun purchases was so broad that it wouldapply to all firearms, not just handguns.   The crime bill flap might even produce the Willie Hortonof 1992. In the most controversial television commercial ofthe 1988 campaign, Republicans painted Democratic candidateMichael Dukakis as soft on crime by recounting how Horton, aconvicted Massachusetts murderer, committed rape while onfurlough from prison.   Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) suggests that Republicans nextcould saddle Democrats with William Andrews, a convictedmultiple murderer who has been on death row in Utah since1974, but who has managed to avoid his fate through appeals.Sen. Hatch alleges that the legislation thatPresident Bushsays he'll veto would do little to end the appeals, while thepresident's proposal would.</TEXT></DOC>
