Romanian police opened fire on protesters during weekendanti-government riots and at least two people, including a child,were killed, a person traveling in the region said. An unconfirmedreport in the West German media said hundreds were killed.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the violentclashes were the result of suppression of legitimate dissent bycitizens frustrated with repression and hardships under the regimeof President Nicolae Ceausescu, among the last of the East Bloc'shard-line communist rulers.   Ceausescu has forcefully rejected reforms that are sweeping therest of Eastern Europe.   ``Since the government doesn't have the support of the people,it is following a terribly mistaken course of using security forcesto repress a serious manifestation of popular discontent with thepolicies of the Ceausescu regime,'' Ms. Tutwiler told reporters atthe department's daily briefing.   She said the U.S. ambassador in Bucharest, Alan Green, was``determining what form our protest will take.''   Ms. Tutwiler noted that the United States has ``consistentlycriticized that regime's repression of dissent and denial offundamental human rights to its people.''   She said the United States was ``especially critical'' ofauthorities' use of force against the Rev. Laszlo Toekes, aReformed Church minister in Timisoara, in western Romania. Theunrest began Saturday after his congregation sought to protect himfrom a court-ordered move to another town, Ms. Tutwiler said.   ``The demonstration apparently grew in size and took on ananti-government tone,'' she said. On Sunday, she said, governmentsecurity units ``brutally put down the demonstration with the useof truncheons, tear gas and water cannons.''   She said she could not confirm reports of casualties or ofgunfire.   Toekes, an ethnic Hungarian, has championed the rights of otherethnic Hungarians in the face of what they see as harassment byRomanian authorities. When the protest began Saturday, he wasseeking to exercise legitimate religious rights, Ms. Tutwiler said.   The U.S. Embassy has been repeatedly rebuffed in its efforts tovisit and talk with Toekes because of security personnel deployedaround his church and home, she said.   ``We call upon the Romanian government to cease its pressureagainst Rev. Toekes and his congregation and allow him to exercisehis fundamental freedom to communicate,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.   As to reports that Hungary has sealed its borders in an effortto prevent news of the unrest from reaching the outside, she said:   ``Of course it would concern us, and of course as in all theother countries we are for self-determination of those people. Thisis no different in Romania than it has been in any of the othercountries'' where change has occurred in Eastern Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
