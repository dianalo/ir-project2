On July 1, 1987 EPA promulgated newambient air quality standards for particulate matter which are based uponthe measurement of particles having an aerodynamic diameter of 10 micronsor less (PM<T2>10</T2>). Consequently, states are required to develop plans whichprovide for attainment and maintenance of these new standards. The NewYork statewide SIP revision demonstrates that the existing SIP for totalsuspended particulates (TSP) is adequate to provide for attainment andmaintenance of the PM<T2>10</T2> standards.This notice also announces EPA's proposed approval of a request from theState of New York to revise the air quality TSP designation for areas inthe following Air Quality Control Regions (AQCRs): New York-New Jersey-ConnecticutInterstate AQCR and Central New York AQCR. Specifically, this action meansthat the air quality in these locations will now be designated as ``unclassifiable''with respect to particulate matter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received by May 31, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>All comments should be addressed to: William J.

BackgroundandCx.18;</ITAG>In 1971, EPA promulgated primary and secondary national ambient air qualitystandards for particulate matter, measured as ``total suspended particulatematter'' or ``TSP''. The primary standards were set at 260 andCx.18;g/m3,24-hour average not to be exceeded more than once per year, and 75 andCx.18;g/m3,annual geometric mean. The secondary standard, also measured as TSP, wasset at 150 andCx.18;g/m3, 24-hour average not to be exceeded more than onceper year. In accordance with sections 108 and 109 of the Clean Air Act,EPA has reviewed and revised the health and welfare critiera upon whichthese primary and secondary particulate matter standards were based.In a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice published on July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24634),EPA announced its final decisions regarding changes to the particulatematter standards. Specifically, (1) TSP was replaced as the indicator fordetermining attainment of particulate matter standards by a new indicatorthat consists of measuring only particles with an aerodynamic diameterless than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM<T2>10</T2>); (2) replacing the 24-hour primary TSP standard with a 24-hourPM<T2>10</T2> standard of 150 andCx.18;g/m3 with no more than one expectedexceedance per year; (3) replacing the annual primary TSP standard witha PM<T2>10</T2> standard of 50 andCx.18;g/m3, expected annual arithmetic mean;and (4) replacing the secondary TSP standard with 24-hour and annual andCx.18;g/m3standard that are identical in all respects to the primary standards.The new PM<T2>10</T2> indicator was selected since it includes all the particlessmall enough to cause the adverse health effects associated with breathingparticle-laden air. These smaller particles are detrimental to human respiratoryhealth due to their ability to penetrate the sensitive alveolar regionsof the lung.A. Group DesignationsBecause PM<T2>10</T2> air quality data was lacking in most areas of the country,EPA could not arbitrarily designate areas as attainment or nonattainment.EPA then developed an analysis using historical ambient TSP data and anyavailable PM<T2>10</T2> data to classify all counties in the nation into one of threegroups based upon the statistical probabilities of not attaining the newPM<T2>10</T2> standards. EPA has classified the following: (1) Areas witha probability of not attaining the PM<T2>10</T2> standard of at least 95 percent as ``Group I'', (2) areas witha probability of not attaining the PM<T2>10</T2> standard of between 20 and 95 percent as ``Group II'', and(3) areas with a probability of not attaining the PM<T2>10</T2> standard of less than 20 percent as ``Group III''. All areasare currently conducting ambient monitoring to determine whether actualambient PM<T2>10</T2> concentrations are above or below the PM<T2>10</T2> NAAQS.B. SIP RevisionsFor Group I areas, a State Implementation Plan (SIP) is required with sufficientPM<T2>10</T2> control strategies included to demonstrate attainment and maintenanceof the standard. For Group II areas, the state must submit a ``committal''SIP that supplements the existing TSP SIP with enforceable commitments.Specific commitments should include plans to collect and analyze PM<T2>10</T2> ambient air quality data and to report violations to the EPARegion III Office. For Group III areas, existing SIP documents are adequatebut the SIP revision must include provisions for Prevention of SignificantDeterioration (PSD) and PM<T2>10</T2> monitoring. A full SIP revision would be required for a GroupII or Group III area if a monitoring site records four exceedances of thePM<T2>10</T2> 24-hour standard over a three year period or less or if thePM<T2>10</T2> annual arithmetic mean is greater than 50 andCx.18;g/m3 basedon three consecutive years of data.Each SIP for particulate matter must be revised for PM<T2>10</T2> in order to: (1) Include State ambient air quality standardsfor PM<T2>10</T2> at least as stringent as the NAAQS; (2) trigger preconstructionreview for new or modified sources which would emit significant amountsof either PM or PM<T2>10</T2> emissions; (3) invoke the emergency episode plan to preventPM<T2>10</T2> concentrations from reaching the significant harm level of600 andCx.18;g/m3; (4) meet ambient PM<T2>10</T2> monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 58; and (5) meet the requirementsof 40 CFR 51.322 and 51.323 to report actual emissions of PM<T2>10</T2> (beginning with emissions for calendar year 1988) for pointsources emitting 100 tons per year or more.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. SIP Content and Review</ITAG>On May 28, 1988 New York State submitted a SIP for PM<T2>10</T2> which contains the following: (1) Current particulate air qualitydata for each Air Quality Control Region; (2) description of existing andproposed monitoring network for PM<T2>10</T2>; (3) air quality control of particulate matter under existingregulations and controls; (4) PSD from new sources and modifications and;(5) additional commitments for the area in the Village of Solvay, OnondagaCounty. In New York State, EPA has designated one Group III area in theVillage of Solvay, Onondaga County. Thr rest of the State is designatedas Group III.A. Outline of Existing PlansNew York State is divided into eight Air Quality Control Regions (AQCRs).The EPA has designated certain areas in these regions, based on populationgrowth and economic development, as Air Quality Maintenance Areas (AQMA).As a result of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, SIP revisions werewritten in 1978 for each AQMA. From time to time, revisions of these planshave been made. All existing SIPs will continue to cover those areas andpollutants addressed in those plans. Particulate controls and regulationscalled for in the TSP SIPs will continue to be enforced. The New York StateImplementation Plan includes statewide SIP revisions resulting from thechange in the particulate matter standard.B. MonitoringSince 1983, EPA has been assisting in and encouraging states to developPM<T2>10</T2> monitoring networks. As a result, New York State has PM<T2>10</T2> air quality monitoring equipment operating at 15 monitoringsites where TSP concentrations had historically been high and/or wherelocal emission sources contribute to PM<T2>10</T2> concentrations. The following sampling frequencies are beingobserved for the different area designations: (1) All Group I areas require,for one year or its equivalent, every day PM<T2>10</T2> sampling at the site of maximum concentration with other siteson a sixth day schedule; (2) Group II areas require, for one year or itsequivalent, every other day PM<T2>10</T2> sampling at the site of maximum concentration with other siteson a sixth day schedule and; (3) for Group III areas, PM<T2>10</T2> monitoring is on a sixth day schedule at any site.C. Pre-Construction Review, New Source Review (NSR) and Prevention of SignificantDeterioration (PSD)New source review in TSP nonattainment areas will continue to be coveredunder Title 6 of the New York Code of Rules and Regulations (6 NYCRR) ChapterIII Part 231.Once TSP areas have been designated as attainment or unclassifiable, allnew or modified construction at a major facility must conform to PSD review.TSP increments will continue to be used under PSD review until new PM<T2>10</T2> increments are established. Therefore, the PSD review programmust evaluate particulate emissions on the basis of both TSP and PM<T2>10</T2>. A major source is subject to PSD review if the increase inemissions is 25 tons/year for TSP or 15 tons/year for PM<T2>10</T2>. One year of preconstruction monitoring will be required bya source owner if the ambient air quality impact of the proposed sourceis 10 ug/m3 for either TSP or PM<T2>10</T2>. If a source would be located in an area that is in violationof the PM<T2>10</T2> standard, the source would be required to obtain offsettingemissions reductions prior to construction.EPA has delegated authority for implementing the Federal PSD program tothe State of New York and, as such, the State has included PM<T2>10</T2> in its PSD review program. (New York State Air Quality ImplementationPlan, Appendix A, April 1, 1988).D. Regulations and Consent OrdersThe State of New York is maintaining all existing regulations and/or consentorders which pertain to particulate control. These controls will remainin place to ensure that the air quality in the State does not deteriorateand the PM<T2>10</T2> NAAQS is maintained.E. Annual NEDS Emissions Data ReportingNew York State reports emissions data for point sources emitting 100 tons/yearor more of any criteria pollutant each year. This information is enteredby EPA into the National Emissions Data System (NEDS). Starting with calendaryear 1988, TSP emissions data will be replaced by PM<T2>10</T2> emission data. Calendar year 1988 PM<T2>10</T2> emission data will be reported in July, 1989.F. Changes to State Emergency Episode PlansNew York State has made the following changes to the State Emergency EpisodePlans as a result of the new PM<T2>10</T2> standard: (1) The significant harm level for particulate matteris revised from 1000 andCx.18;g/m3 measured as TSP to 600 andCx.18;g/m3 measuredas PM<T2>10</T2>. (2) The combined sulfur dioxide/particulate matter significantharm level is deleted. (3) The alert level for particulate matter (PM<T2>10</T2>) is changed to 350 andCx.18;g/m3 for a 24-hour average. (4) Thewarning level for particulate matter (PM<T2>10</T2>) is changed to 420 andCx.18;g/m3 for a 24-hour average. (5) Theemergency level for particulate matter (PM<T2>10</T2>) is changed to 500 andCx.18;g/m3 for a 24-hour average.EPA believes that these levels will provide sufficient warning so thatpreventative measures can be initiated before a major episode can occur.G. Group II Area_Village of Solvay, Onondaga CountyBased on monitored data collected in the Village of Solvay (site 360672002)during 1984-1986, EPA has classified the area as a Group II PM<T2>10</T2> area. Therefore, New York State has committed to the requirementsfor Group II areas as stated in the July 1, 1987 notice (52 FR 24681).Modeling results in 1978 and in 1980 indicated that the Solvay site waspredominately impacted by the Allied Chemical Plant in the area. Sincethis plant closed in June, 1986, the concentrations at this monitoringsite have decreased.<ITAG tagnum="81">(1) PM</ITAG><T2>10</T2> Monitoring SolvayBecause the Village of Solvay, Onondaga County is classified as Group II,New York State is committed to monitor PM<T2>10</T2> at this site every other day for one year or at an equivalentschedule of every sixth day sampling for a period of 37 months. Since PM<T2>10</T2> monitoring was started on August 17, 1985, New York State electedto use the equivalent monitoring schedule since approximately three yearsof data has already been collected. As of June 26, 1987, there have been215 samples collected at this site, resulting in an overall arithmeticmean of 34 andCx.18;g/m3. The maximum value recorded during this period was89 andCx.18;g/m3.In addition to collecting three years of data, DEC has agreed to operateadditional PM<T2>10</T2> monitors in the area of predicted maximum concentration ifthe operation of the boilers resumes at the Allied Chemical Plant.<ITAG tagnum="81">(2) Air Quality Control of Particulate Matter</ITAG>The closing of the Allied Chemical Plant removed a large source of particulateemissions from the area. This facility not only impacted the Solvay area,but also had an effect on air quality in Syracuse. Should the boilers atthe Allied Chemical Plant resume operation, an air quality evaluation maybe warranted to determine the impact from the source. EPA considers theexisting regulations, as well as both State and Federal Motor Vehicle EmissionsControl Programs, as being sufficient for attaining and maintaining thenew PM<T2>10</T2> standards in the Village of Solvay and the Syracuse AQMA. Also,the control measures in the existing TSP SIP will continue to be enforced.<ITAG tagnum="81">(3) Additional Commitments for Group II Area in Solvay</ITAG>New York State has committed to the following:i. Analyze and verify the ambient PM<T2>10</T2> air quality data and report 24-hour PM<T2>10</T2> exceedance to the EPA Region II office within 45 days of eachexceedance. After an equivalent monitoring period (three years), analyzeair quality data and determine the long term monitoring requirement andattainment status.ii. Within 30 days of notification of a PM<T2>10</T2> exceedance or within 30 months of promulgation of the PM<T2>10</T2> standard, whichever comes first, determine whether the measuresin the existing Syracuse TSP SIP will assure the timely attainment andmaintenance of the primary PM<T2>10</T2> standards and immediately notify EPA Region II. iii. Within 6 months after notifying EPA Region II of a PM<T2>10</T2> non-attainment problem, adopt and submit to EPA Region II aPM<T2>10</T2> control strategy that assures attainment within three yearsfrom the approval date of the PM<T2>10</T2> SIP revisions for the Solvay Group II area.<ITAG tagnum="81">(4) Schedule of Activities</ITAG>The SIP revision shall demonstrate that both daily and annual nationalambient air quality standards for PM<T2>10</T2> will not be exceeded. In the village of Solvay, New York Statewill follow the following schedule for attainment demonstration:_August 17, 1985, PM<T2>10</T2> monitoring started at Solvay Site 360672002._September 17, 1988, monitoring period completed at the Solvay site._January 16, 1989, Analyze monitor data and determine attainment status._October 16, 1989, TSP and PM<T2>10</T2> actual and allowable emissions data prepared for the Solvayarea.H. Group III AreasBased on monitored TSP data and some PM<T2>10</T2> data, the entire state of New York, outside the Village ofSolvay, is designated as Group III for PM<T2>10</T2>. As such, EPA believes that the existing TSP SIP is adequateto demonstrate attainment and maintenance of the PM<T2>10</T2> standards. New York State, in its SIP revision, has committedto the monitoring and PSD requirements for Group III areas (see sectionsB and C of this notice). Any Group II or Group III areas which subsequentlyobserve violations of the PM<T2>10</T2> NAAQS will be treated as a newly discovered non-attainmentarea. Thus, the State will submit a full control strategy which demonstratesattainment of the PM<T2>10</T2> standard within three years. The following AQCRs and AQMAs are designated as Group III for PM<T2>10</T2> by EPA._New York-New Jersey-Connecticut AQCR_Hudson Valley AQCR_Northern AQCR_Central New York AQCR (Utica-Rome AQMA)_Genesee Finger Lakes AQCR_Niagara Frontier AQCR_Southern Tier West AQCR_Southern Tier East AQCRI. Niagara FrontierThere has never been a recorded violation of the PM<T2>10</T2> standard in the Niagara Frontier. The application of EPA'sscreening technique demonstrates that the Niagara Frontier is a Group IIIarea. However, the area has never had an approved TSP SIP. The State hason January 5, 1987 submitted a TSP control strategy and attainment demonstrationfor the Niagara Frontier. EPA will take rulemaking action on this submittalin a separate <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice.J. Other Administrative RequirementsAs part of the public notification process, New York State published anotice announcing the availability of the SIP revision in the Departmentof Environmental Conservation's Environmental Notice Bulletin (ENB) onMarch 30, 1988 and requested comments.While EPA believes that the State did provide adequate opportunity forpublic comments, EPA regulations require the State to provide an opportunityfor a public hearing. Therefore, the State has been notified that theymust provide interested individuals an opportunity to comment and requesta public hearing if they have substantial negative comments concerningthe proposed approval of this SIP revision. These individuals would haveto request this public hearing in writing and provide the basis to supporttheir negative position.In addition, EPA is providing an opportunity to submit written commentson the proposed SIP revision to the address at the beginning of this notice.All comments shall be considered before a final rulemaking action is takenon this SIP revision.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Designation of Areas for Air Quality Planning Purposes; Revisionto Section 107 Attainment Status Designations for the State of New York</ITAG>A.BackgroundUnder 107(d) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7407 (d), directs each stateto submit to the Administrator of the EPA a list of NAAQS attainment statusdesignations for all areas within the state. EPA received such designationsfrom the states and promulgated them on March 3, 1978 (43 FR 9862). Pursuantto 52 FR 24682 in the July 1, 1987 <T4>Federal Register, </T4>states are encouragd to request the redesignationof TSP nonattainment areas to unclassifiable at the time the PM<T2>10</T2> control stretegy for the area is submitted. When EPA approvesthe control strategy as sufficient to attain and maintain the PM<T2>10</T2> NAAQS, it will also approve the redesignation. Since New YorkState made revisions to the SIP for particulate matter that enable theState to protect the NAAQS for particulate matter having a nominal aerodynamicdiameter of 10 microns (PM<T2>10</T2>), EPA will redesignate TSP Primary or Secondary nonattainmentarea in the following AQCRs to unclassifiable: (1) New York-New Jersey-ConnecticutInterstate AQCR; (2) Hudson Valley AQCR and; (3) Central New York AQCR.The TSP attainment areas in New York remain attainment for TSP.One significant result of EPA's rulemaking is that states will no longerbe required to subject major new and modified sources of particulate matterto the nonattainment requirements under Part D of the Clean Air Act. Thatis, because EPA is implementing the PM<T2>10</T2> NAAQS accordance with section 110 of the Clean Air Act andwill not promulgate any nonattainment area designations (pursuant to section107n of the Clean Air Act) for PM<T2>10</T2>, the nonattainment area NSR requirements contained in paragraph(a) of section 51.165 will not apply to PM<T2>10</T2>. Furthermore, in light of EPA's deletion of the TSP indicatorfor the NAAQS, EPA no longer requires states to submit TSP nonattainmentarea NSR requirements based on Part D of the Clean Air Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion </ITAG>The existing regulations and control programs since 1970 have resultedin improved particulate air quality in New York State such that a statewidecomposite level has fallen from 73 andCx.18;g/m\3\ in 1970 to 40.5 andCx.18;g/m\3\in 1987. TSP concentrations in New York State are predominately influencedby combustion sources and motor vehicles. Combustion sources are controlledby State regulations through the Department of Environmental Conservation'spermit system while State and Federal Motor Vehicle Control programs limitmotor vehicle emissions. Since a large percentage of the particles thatare being controlled by these programs have emissions that are less than10 microns, existing controls and strategies are considered adequate forcontrolling and maintaining the PM<T2>10</T2> standard in New York State. Air quality in the Village of Solvayhas improved after the closing of a major facility and PM<T2>10</T2> monitoring data indicates that this area should attain thePM<T2>10</T2> standards without any new regulations.EPA is soliciting public comments on this notice and on issues relevantto EPA's proposed action. Comments will be considered before taking finalaction. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedureby submitting written comments to the address at the beginning of thisnotice.The revisions are being proposed under a procedure called ``parallel processing''(47 FR 27073). If the proposed revisions are substantially changed in areasother than those identified in this notice, EPA will publish a revisedNotice of Proposed Rulemaking. If no substantial changes are made otherthan those areas cited in this notice, EPA will publish a Final RulemakingNotice on the revisions. The final rulemaking action by EPA will occuronly after the SIP revisions have been adopted by New York State and submittedto EPA for incorporation into the SIP.This notice is issued as required by section 110 of the Clean Air Act,as amended. The Administrator's decision regarding the approval of thisplan revision is based on its meeting the requirements of section 110 ofthe Clean Air Act, and 40 CFR Part 51.Under 5 U.S.C. section 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>40 CFR Part 52Air pollution control, Particulate matter.40 CFR Part 81Air pollution control, National Parks, Wilderness areas.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: April 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William J.
