RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Supreme Court ruling over a Californiaredistricting plan shows the court may be unwilling to restrainstate legislatures from high-tech gerrymandering that gives onepolitical party a big edge when drawing congressional district lines.   The high court's ruling comes at a time when state legislaturesare anticipating redrawing congressional district lines once the1990 census is completed.   The justices, by a vote of 6-3, ruled Tuesday the constitutionalrights of Republicans were not violated by a Californiaredistricting plan that gave Democrats solid control of the state'scongressional delegation.   The court upheld the plan in a one-sentence ruling, sustaining alower court decision that Republicans did not suffer unlawfuldiscrimination.   Republicans said the Democratic-controlled Legislature, using newcomputer technology, unlawfully manipulated district boundaries.   The ruling drew quick reaction from national political leaders,including outgoing Republican National Committee Chairman FrankFahrenkopf and his successor, Lee Atwater.   ``Our immediate goal will be to increase Republicanrepresentation and control in 1990 in statehouses so that theredistricting process following the next census will be in the handsof responsible elected officials, conscious of their constitutionalresponsibilities,'' a joint statement said.   Rep. Beryl Anthony Jr., D-Ark., chairman of the DemocraticCongressional Campaign Committee, welcomed the ruling.   ``The decision vindicates our judgment that the Californiaredistricting plan was lawful and fair to the voters ofCalifornia,'' he said. ``The Republican Party was trying to win incourt what it could not win with the voters.''   In other matters Tuesday, the court:   _Rejected multiple murderer Theodore Bundy's challenge to hisdeath sentence for killing a 12-year-old girl in Florida. The manlinked to as many as 36 sex slayings or disappearances of youngwomen faces execution Tuesday.   _Turned down the appeals of four California death row inmates,including a man linked to the sex slayings of four boys inCalifornia, Texas, West Virginia and New Jersey.   _Let stand a ruling in a case from Boston that allowsanti-smoking groups to see and publicize a cigarette company'sresearch the groups say could link smoking to health hazards.   _Rejected a challenge to a Virginia law exempting religiouslyaffiliated child-care centers from some health and safetyregulations all other child-care centers must meet.   _Agreed to decide whether people who intervene in civil rightscases _ and are not the principal defendants _ may be forced to paythe lawyer fees incurred by those who successfully sue. The casestems from a sex bias lawsuit against Trans World Airlines.   _Heard arguments in a free-speech challenge to a Massachusettslaw that cracks down on child pornography. The justices are toannounce a decision by July.   In the California redistricting case, Chief Justice William H.Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedyvoted to grant full review to the dispute. Four votes are needed togrant such review.   The other six justices joined in upholding the lower court rulingsustaining the redistricting plan. Their one-sentence decision saidsimply that ``the judgment is affirmed.''   The court said in 1986 in an Indiana legislative reapportionmentcase that gerrymandering _ the manipulation of voting districtboundaries for partisan gain _ may be unlawful even when it resultsin districts meeting the ``one-person, one-vote'' requirement thatdistricts be equally populated.   The justices have held that only if there is evidence of racialbias may a district plan be overturned even when the balancedpopulation test is met.   But in splintered voting, the justices upheld the Indiana planthat was attacked as a violation of Democrats' rights.   The 1986 decision left key questions unanswered, and only fourjustices joined in the court's main opinion, written by JusticeByron R. White.   White said gerrymandering might be unconstitutional if it ``willconsistently degrade a voter's or a group of voters' influence onthe political processes as a whole.''   California Republicans said that is exactly what has happened tothem.   ``The essence of representative democracy is undermined'' when``a computer-generated gerrymander can preordain what thecongressional results will be throughout the decade,'' they said inseeking Supreme Court reconsideration.   A three-judge federal court, by a 2-1 vote last April, upheldCalifornia's plan.   The federal court said Republicans failed to show that the plandeprived them of political power and fair representation.   ``There are no allegations that California Republicans have beenshut out of the political process, nor are there allegations thatanyone has ever interfered with Republican registration, organizing,voting, fund-raising or campaigning,'' said Judge Cecil F. Poole forthe federal court.   Poole, noting that California has a Republican governor, aRepublican U.S. senator and 18 GOP House members, said there is noevidence the party is ``bereft of the ability to exercise potentpower in the political process as a whole.''   Republicans said the Democratic-controlled state Legislaturerigged district lines to allow Democrats to win 27 of the 45 Houseseats from California even though Republican candidates overallreceived roughly half the votes cast in recent elections.</TEXT></DOC>
