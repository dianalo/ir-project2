 The experience of these companies shows that in theshort run, CASE tools have negligible effect on productivity.andP;  The mainreason is that CASE technology must be used with a formal methodology to beeffective.andP;  The patience of those pioneers, however, promises to pay offthree years down the road when CASE technology is expected to dramaticallyimprove software quality.andP;  The improvements will stem directly from thedecreased maintenance and increased productivity that will accrue over thetotal life of a system developed with CASE tools.andM;A special DATAMATION/Price Waterhouse opinion survey reveals that in mostorganizations CASE tools are only in the initial stages of implementation.andO;In fact, our sample shows that the technology is currently affecting only oneout of four installations in the U.S.andP;  But within the next three years, as itbecomes more widespread, CASE is expected to impact one out of every twoAmerican organizations, according to our survey.andM;During the startup stage, expectations for CASE are relatively modestregarding productivity.andP;  Fifty-seven percent of the respondents say theydidn't think CASE would have any effect on productivity; another 11% feelthat the technology would actually have a negative effect on softwaredevelopment productivity.andM;Although most (68%) of the current users see no direct productivityimprovements, they cite several CASE benefits thatandM;actually contribute to better productivity.andP;   Among the advantagesandM;are faster development and a more uniform level for interim products withinthe system development life cycle (SDLC).andP;  Therefore, it seems that withinthese organizations, productivity is being measured primarily in terms oftotal elapsed time in the software development process.andM;The productivity prognosis is considerably brighter over the longer term.andO;Fifty-one percent of the organizations sampled predict that CASE would spawnsoftware productivity jumps of up of 100% over the next five years.andO;Productivity surges of up to 200% by 1993 are foreseen by 20% of the CASEusers surveyed.andM;Fifty-four percent of current CASE customers expect to see much quickersoftware development by 1993, as a result of the technology.andP;  The most markeddifference between today and tomorrow comes in the maintenance area.andP;  Awhopping 45% of the companies predict that within five years, longer programlife would be the big plus of using CASE tools.andM;The reason for the expected program life extension lies in the level ofdecomposition that can be achieved via a CASE tool in the analysis and designstages of the SDLC.andP;  Today, most people are not using CASE for decomposition.andO;This is reflected by our sample, which shows that only 18% of users expectlonger program life as a result of CASE.andP;  Better project control andstandards enforcement are also expected to be bigger benefits in another fiveyears.andM;The case for CASE today shows a somewhat different picture.andP;  Organizationsresponding to the survey report that the current selling points of thetechnology are faster software development, improved documentation, andbetter standards enforcement.andP;  Twenty-nine percent like the fact that theycould use CASE to provide a platform for prototyping.andP;  Users forecast thatCASE's prototyping muscle will be even stronger by 1993, when screen paintersand end-user reporting tools are incorporated within the CASE environment.andM;In conducting the survey, Price Waterhouse considered Upper CASE tools suchas tools for analysis and design.andP;  Lower CASE tools for automated codegeneration, and integrated project support environment (IPSE) tools thatintegrate analysis, design, and construction tasks with project managementfacilities within the SDLC.andM;From the survey, it appears that the usage of CASE depends on a company'soverall information technology budget.andP;  The bigger the budget, the more moneythat can be devoted to making the major investments in the training and inthe methodology needed to implement Upper CASE tools.andM;It naturally follows then that the companies using Upper CASE are the sameones that have hsitorically seen pioneers in applying new technologies.andP;  Oursurvey indicates that those firms fall into the large- to midrangecategories.andP;  In the context of this survey, the number of employees was usedto establish company size.andM;Twenty-three percent of all survey respondents say they are using an UpperCASE tool; 25% plan to use one for analysis and design chores.andP;  Twelvepercent of companies in the 5,000-to-10,000-employee bracket are using toolsfor analysis and design tasks within the SDLC, while another 28% have overallplans to deploy Upper CASE products.andM;In firms with under 500 employees, 70% have no plans to explore Upper CASEtools.andP;  This may be a reflection of the level of sophistication within theorganizations.andP;  Or it may be that management's concern over systemproductivity has yet to surface within those particular organizations.andP;  Ineither case, the low usage of Upper Case products in smaller companies isunderstandable because of the costs involved in implementing them.andM;Further along the CASE ladder, 32% of all companies note that they werecurrently working with integrated project management tools; 21% have plans touse them.andP;  Roughly 40% of interviewed companies that range in size from 1,000to 10,000 employees are making use of automated projected management tools.andO;Another 30% of same isze firms predict they will be plugging in these toolswithin the next 12 months.andP;  However, it's evident that to take full advantageof either Upper or Lower CASE tools, the existing software staff will have tobe more extensively trained in the use of structured analysis and designformalisms.andM;Twenty percent of our sample report using Lower CASE products; another 26%indicate they are planning to.andP;  Half of the large companies (with employeerosters of 10,000 to 50,000 people) are already applying Lower CASE wares.andO;The slower implementation of Lower CASE may be related to the protractedacquisition process for these expensive tools.andP;  Also, there is mountingevidence that developers are experiencing frustration because of theirunrealistic expectations that CASE will generate complete programs for allsituations.andM;In conducting the study, Price Waterhouse asked companies for situationswhere they had rejected or not even considered CASE tools.andP;  The generalrejection level was between 2% and 4%, indicating that among our sample thereare very few firms that have tried and rejected CASE technology.andM;That doesn't mean CASE is trouble-free.andP;  Three main CASE problem areas arepointed up by the DATAMATION/Price Waterhouse survey: the extreme amount ofhype generated by sales personnel and the press; the costs associated withbringing multiple single-user copies of Upper CASE tools into a synchronizeddata repository; and the frequent frustration of people who want to tailorthe basically inflexible CASE tools to particular methodologies or standardsalready in place within an organization.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
