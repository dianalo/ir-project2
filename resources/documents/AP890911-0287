U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie rejected the request byGoldsmith and his Hoylake Investments Ltd. for a preliminaryinjunction barring the review by California's Department ofInsurance.   A federal judge in Washington state denied a similar requestFriday, as did a Texas judge last month. In another case Friday,insurance regulators in Kansas denied Goldsmith's attempts to escaperegulatory review there.   Goldsmith is scrambling to get an extension of the Oct. 7deadline by which he must complete the acquisition of BAT underBritish takeover rules.   He has agreed to sell Farmers, the third-largest home and autoinsurance company in the United States, to the French insurer AxaMidi Assurances for $4.5 billion if his takeover succeeds for BAT,the London-based tobacco, retailing, paper and financial servicesconcern.   Meantime, Goldsmith filed federal suits in all nine states inwhich Farmers does business, contending state regulatory review ofthe proposed hostile takeover is an unconstitutional infringement onforeign commerce.   After the nearly two-hour hearing Monday in Los Angeles federalcourt, however, Rafeedie refused to grant the requested preliminaryinjunction.   ``The plaintiff has not demonstrated the probability of successor that the state act directly regulates foreign commerce,''Rafeedie said.   The state statutes involved give insurance departments authorityto protect insurance policyholders by reviewing insurance industrytakeovers.</TEXT></DOC>
