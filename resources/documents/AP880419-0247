Allen will have a chance on Wednesdayto convince ATandamp;T's shareholders that the company remains on trackin spite of the death from cancer of Chairman James E. Olson.   Olson's death on Monday at age 62 came just two days before thecompany's annual shareholders' meeting in Denver. It shocked thecompany, coming just one month after the vigorous, tough-talkingexecutive was reported ill with flu.   Allen, 53, who will field questions at the annual meeting, isthe president and chief operating officer of American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co.and is serving as acting chairman.   Analysts say Allen was being groomed to succeed Olson aschairman, although no one expected the transition to come soquickly. He is the odds-on favorite to be named chairman by theboard of directors, which might make a decision this week.   Like Olson, Allen rose in ATandamp;T through the local telephoneoperating companies that once belonged to the Bell System. He alsois a career ATandamp;T executive. But in contrast to the blunt,gregarious Olson, Allen is described as quiet and thoughtful,though determined.   ``He's a very bright and very direct kind of guy and verylow-key. If you lived in a nice neighborhood, he'd be one of thenicer neighbors,'' said Peter Bernstein, senior analyst at ProbeResearch Inc. in Cedar Knolls, N.J.   Olson became ATandamp;T chairman in September 1986, when the companystill was adrift after the 1984 breakup of the Bell System. He cutcosts, oversaw the painful cutting of 27,000 jobs and gave thecompany a sense of direction.   ``Olson was the one guy who was hard-nosed enough that he wouldpush and get his way, and drive people who may not feel the samepressure under the new chairman,'' said Fulton Holmes, an analystfor Thomson McKinnon Securities.   In contrast to Olson, whose first job with ATandamp;T was cleaningsilt out of manholes in North Dakota in 1943, Allen started out inmanagement at Indiana Bell after his graduation from Wabash College.   Allen worked his way up through Indiana Bell, Bell ofPennsylvania, Illinois Bell and the Chesapeake and PotomacTelephone Cos. He was slated to become a president inPhiladelphia-based Bell Atlantic at the time of the ATandamp;T breakup in1984, but instead was called to serve as executive vice presidentand chief financial officer of ATandamp;T in July 1983.   Allen took charge of corporate administration and finance in1984 and was promoted to chairman and chief executive of ATandamp;TInformation Systems in 1985. He was named president and chiefoperating officer in 1986.   In a sign of Allen's standing, he shared the spotlight withOlson in the introduction to the company's latest annual report,which featured a question-and-answer session with the twoexecutives.   Here are some of the problems ATandamp;T will have to face with Olsongone:   _Morale, though somewhat improved, still leaves room forimprovement, ATandamp;T's own surveys have found.   _The company's computer business continues losing money and maynot become profitable until 1990. Some analysts say the companyneeds to buy an established computer maker.   _Shareholders are agitating for an increase in the quarterlydividend, which has been $1.20 a share since the breakup.   _ATandamp;T still gets 91 percent of its revenue in the United Statesand is having a hard time cracking foreign markets, a company goalsince the early 1980s.   Analysts differed on how significant Olson's loss would be.   ``In a lot of ways, Allen is an unknown quantity. My sense is hedoes not have the kind of following Olson had. But he has not beenin a position where he could get those loyalties,'' said DanielRosenbaum, executive editor of Wiretap newsletter in Morristown,N.J.   ``What he (Olson) forged together may start to slip apart alittle bit,'' said Thomson McKinnon's Holmes.   But Jack Grubman, an analyst for PaineWebber Inc., said Allen isOlson's hand-picked successor. And he said, ``Jim (Olson) is notthe type of guy to groom someone if he did not feel that personwould carry forward his plans.''   On the New York Stock Exchange, ATandamp;T stock fell 25 cents to26.37{ on Monday.   Allen and his wife, Elizabeth, have five children and live inShort Hills, N.J., Olson's hometown.  </TEXT></DOC>
