The companies include Tele-Communications Inc., Time Inc.'s 82%-owned American Television andamp; Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and Continental Cablevision Inc. The new research firm, Cable Television Laboratories Inc., will have an initial three-year operating budget of $22.5 million; its funding is expected to increase when other companies join the group.    John Malone, president of Tele-Communications and Trygve Myhren, chief executive officer of American Television, said the laboratory's job will be to identify the extent to which the industry should adopt certain new technologies and invest in new plant and equipment.    Mr. Malone noted that the cable industry generates about $5 billion annually after operating expenses and uses $1 billion of those funds on general capital expenditures. &quot;What we're doing here is committing $7.5 million a year to figure out what to spend the other $4 billion on,&quot; he said.    At present, the executives noted, many cable concerns are funding their own modest research projects, but there is no industrywide effort to determine future directions. He said the laboratory expects to assign some projects to larger research outfits, such as American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s Bell Laboratories. Mr. Malone said the cable industry is also &quot;a huge potential customer&quot; for advanced communications products of ATandamp;T and others.    Among the decisions confronting the cable industry now is how and when to adopt high-definition television, a new system of transmission that promises to bring movie-theater vivid images into the home. An HD-TV picture is greatly enhanced because it is composed of more than six times the number of picture elements -- the thousands of dots that make up a television pictureas a standard television image.    Related to the issue of providing a higher quality product is the substitution of high-capacity fiber optic cable for some portion of the copper-based coaxial cable currently used to deliver cable television signals.    Mr. Myhren of American Television said the industry research lab will also examine more efficient ways to scramble satellite-delivered television programs to avoid theft, and other security issues. &quot;We are also identifying industry needs for other manufacturers who have huge Randamp;D labs,&quot; Mr. Myhren said. &quot;A united industry effort will create a market large enough to attract&quot; giant hardware and equipment manufacturers to design new products, he added.    Plans for the consortium were developed by the National Cable Television Association, an industry group. The large group of cable firms will collaborate without anti-trust fears under guidelines established by the Cooperative Research Act of 1984. An executive search firm has been retained to find a chief executive for the laboratory. </TEXT></DOC>
