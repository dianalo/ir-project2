The binding elicits a protein transformation resultingin transcriptional activation of limited sets of target genes. Usingprobes derived from clones expressing fusion proteins immunoreactivewith human glucocorticoid receptor antibodies, the authors isolated thefull-length cDNA as a first step toward understanding the mechanism bywhich steroid receptors enhance gene transcription.</TEXT></DOC>
