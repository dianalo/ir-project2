The action by Equitable Life Assurance Society of theU.S.'s board follows months of complicated negotiationsbetween the company and regulators. Although the company,based in New York, had provided broad outlines of thetransaction, Wednesday's board action provided importantdetails about how policyholders will be cashed out under theplan.</LP><TEXT>   In essence, the plan will give the fattest rewards topolicyholders whose business has brought the insurer the mostprofits. That would mean holders of guaranteed investmentcontracts, for instance, would not fare as well as whole lifepolicy holders, whose business is, in general, moreprofitable. The payout levels stem from a New York law passedseveral years ago. Equitable's demutualization will be thefirst time that law will be applied.   Chairman Richard Jenrette announced last year thatEquitable would convert from a mutual insurer, owned bypolicyholders, to a public company, following heavy losses oninvestments and in certain of its businesses. As part of theplan, Equitable sold a roughly 45% equity stake to Groupe AxaS.A., the French insurer, this summer for $1 billion. Nextyear it plans to sell stock to the public.   &quot;I am greatly encouraged by the progress Equitable ismaking in reaching its important objective to demutualize,&quot;Mr. Jenrette said as part of the announcement.   The plan has not yet been approved by regulators, althoughEquitable and its investment bankers and lawyers have been inextensive discussions with them in recent months. Under NewYork law, twothirds of Equitable's eligible policyholdersalso must approve the plan. Equitable said 2.2 million life,health and disability policyholders and annuity contractholders are eligible to vote.   Meanwhile, Stephen Friedman, general counsel, said in aninterview, prior to the board's approval, that Equitable iscontinuing discussions with investors about the sale offurther interests in the company. The insurer has left thatpossibilty open since Axa's investment this summer.   Following the stock offering next year, Equitablepolicyholders are scheduled to receive stock, cash or policycredits in return for their current ownership of the insurer.Under the plan approved Wednesday, each of Equitable's 2.2million policyholders, will receive at least three shares ofcommon stock.   The number of shares they receive in addition to that willdepend on a number of factors including the age of thepolicy, when it was bought and its type. Policyholders whowould receive 10 shares or less under the plan can opt toreceive cash instead, Mr. Friedman said. The company will notpay out more than 50% of the proceeds of the stock offeringin cash to policyholders, he said.   In general, policyholders who bought their policies longago, or who hold very large policies, will receive thelargest payouts, industry experts said. Policyholders whobought traditional life insurance products, such as wholelife insurance and term life insurance, are likely in manycases to receive larger payouts than those with newervarieties, including variable life insurance products, otherindustry analysts said. Under the plan, annuity holders andholders of guaranteed investment contracts, a type ofinvestment contract sold to pension funds, may receive lowerpayouts relative to other types of policyholders.   The board also approved a plan to segregate $4 billion ininvestments that will provide income to pay dividends topolicyholders who currently receive such payouts. Many ofEquitable's most troubled investments, such as its equityinvestments in real estate, investments in leveraged buyouts,and delinquent mortgages, will be excluded from the $4billion block, however.</TEXT></DOC>
