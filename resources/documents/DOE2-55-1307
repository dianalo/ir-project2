Widths of TKE- and mass- distributions in the fissionof {sup 235}U as a function of neutron energy and variation of thesedistributions as function of the resonances and their quantum numberscan be successfully described on the basis of a three exit channel fissionmodel. In the field of nuclear data for fission technology effort wasconcentrated on European requests in the NEA High Priority Request List.In the subthermal neutron energy region the measurements of {eta} of{sup 235}U previously reported were corrected for multiple scatteringin a more complete manner, and first fission cross-section measurementswere performed at the Very Cold Neutron Source of ILL Grenoble. An experimentalmethod for the determination of efficiencies and response functions ofcapture detectors, when applied to neutron capture measurements, is successfulin reproducing the transmission results of the 1.15 keV resonance in{sup 56}Fe, and resolves the discrepancy which initiated the NEANDC TaskForce. In the area of nuclear data for fusion technology, the measurementsaim at an improvement of relevant data for neutron transport calculationsin the blanket which contains lithium as tritium breeder material andfor prediction of gas production. Also tritium production cross-sectionsfor {sup 9}Be in the energy range from threshold to 20 MeV were measured,in collaboration with KFA Juelich. In the field of metrology for neutronflux and dose CBNM participated in a comparison, organized by BIPM, tocheck the usefulness of the two spheres, technique at neutron energiesof 2.5 and 14.7 MeV for neutron fluence determination.</TEXT></DOC>
