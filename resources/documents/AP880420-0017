Bork's unsuccessful nomination.   ``It's a nice idea in theory, but practically it won't work,''Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, said Tuesday after The Task Force onJudicial Selection issued a report recommending that Supreme Courtnominees no longer testify in public before the Senate JudiciaryCommittee.   The privately financed committee of lawyers, headed by formerGov. Hugh Carey of New York, concluded that ``the confirmationprocess has become dangerously close to looking like the electoralprocess.''   But Hatch, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said any nomineewho refused to testify would almost certainly be rejected by thecommittee and by the full Senate, because the testimony has become``a matter of custom and practice.''   Still, he added, ``There should not be a political process likein the Bork case.''   The report said Senate review of Supreme Court nominees ``hasbecome very much a national referendum on the appointment, withmedia campaigns, polling techniques and political rhetoric thatdistract attention from, and sometimes completely distort, thelegal qualifications of the nominee.''   Television also came in for criticism in the study, which saidTV coverage of the hearings ``invited abuse of the confirmationprocess.''   The report said ``the White House, the Department of Justice,senators, witnesses, and even nominees now seem tempted to usetelevised hearings as a forum for other purposes, ranging fromself-promotion to mobilizing special interest groups in order toinfluence public opinion.''   The fight over Bork's nomination was waged not only in thehearing room, but in newspaper ads, television commercials and newsconferences.   The nominee received an unfavorable recommendation from theJudiciary Committee and was defeated by the Senate last October,58-42.   Critics attacked Bork's narrow reading of constitutionalprotections, calling him anti-civil rights, anti-consumer, andagainst equal rights for women.   Supporters accused opponents of distorting his record, andpainted the nominee as a compassionate man who believed thatjudicial rulings should track the intent of the Constitution'sframers.   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, said the public relationsblitz that Bork endured should not be repeated, but the added thatthe report's suggestion of ending a nominee's testimony ``wouldn'tfly.''   ``We ought to have public dialogue,'' he said.   Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, a Republican who votedagainst Bork, called the report ``an over-reaction to the Borkproceedings.''   ``Any Supreme Court nominee who refused to appear before theJudiciary Committee would not be cleared by the committee,'' hesaid.   The panel did not rule out informal interviews with nominees sothat senators could assess their judicial temperament and legalqualifications.   But Specter said this would ``shut out the public, which has aright to know how the process is working, and whether the publicinterest is protected.'' Grassley and Specter both sit on theJudiciary Committee as well.   The report was commissioned by the Twentieth Century Fund, aprivate foundation that finances studies of public policy issues.   The recommendation drew dissents from Washington attorneys andformer Carter administration officials Lloyd Cutler and JosephCalifano.   ``Supreme Court nominees should testify before the Senate andthey should get all the publicity that modern communications canprovide,'' said Califano, who was secretary of health, educationand welfare in the Carter administration.   Cutler was Carter's White House counsel.   The report noted that until the 1925 testimony of Harlan F.Stone, no Supreme Court nominee had ever appeared as a witnessduring confirmation proceedings. In 1939, Felix Frankfurter becamethe second witness to testify before his confirmation.   Besides Carey, members of the panel were former New York mayorRobert F. Wagner, Washington attorney Michael M. Uhlmann,Georgetown University professor Walter Berns, University of Chicagolaw professor Philip B. Kurland and Nicholas J. Spaeth, attorneygeneral of North Dakota.   Kurland, who advised the Senate Judiciary Committee's chairman,Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., during the Bork hearings, dissented fromthe conclusion that confirmation proceedings had become undulypoliticized.</TEXT></DOC>
