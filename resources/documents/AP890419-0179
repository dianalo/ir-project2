Delay in action by the states, he said, has prevented childrenfrom receiving financial support they are due.   The regulations, which implement the Family Support Act passedlast year by Congress in a major welfare overhaul, sets time limitsfor states to respond to requests for assistance in establishingand enforcing child support orders.   Limits would be established for opening and maintaining caserecords, locating absent parents, establishing paternity, enforcingsupport obligations and receiving and distributing supportpayments. The regulations also provide criteria for states to usein determining whether to close a child support case.   States would be required to comply with those time limits byOct. 1, 1990.   The regulations were published in Wednesday's Federal Register.The Department of Health and Human Services set a 60-day commentperiod, after which the department will issue final rules.</TEXT></DOC>
