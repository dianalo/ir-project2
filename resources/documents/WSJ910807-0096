It is a place wherepolitically motivated thugs periodically board buses andspray the passengers with machine gun bullets, but where themoral outrage of the year involves illicit payments of a fewhundred thousand dollars by the white government to theInkatha movement. The African National Congress is having adelicious time declaring that the secret funding of Inkathapermanently taints the organization. The ANC, recall, is anorganization that for the past decades has received tens ofmillions of dollars from the most tyrannical regimes onearth: Libya, the Soviet Union, Cuba, the PLO.   The Inkathagate scandal is not shocking, but it issurprising. It is not shocking that ministers such as AdriaanVlok, who was willing to defend a system like apartheid,would also be willing to engage in public deception. Evenpoliticians who aren't saddled with racist systems have beenknown to resort to secret maneuverings to preserve theirpower.</LP><TEXT>   Nor is it shocking that the government would try to boostthe power of Inkatha vis-a-vis its rival, the ANC. Inkathaendorses a mixed economy and economic pluralism, while theANC remains dominated by communists, as has been widelyreported in Western news accounts recently. Nor is thereanything wrong with funding Inkatha. The U.S. government willdo it to the tune of $2.5 million through the Agency forInternational Development's Transition to Democracy project(even more money is earmarked for the ANC).   The South African government transfers to Inkatha arenevertheless surprising because they are so stupid. The ANChas always accused Inkatha of being a lackey of the whiteregime. These claims are groundless, but by shoveling fundsto Inkatha, the government has given them a sheen oflegitimacy.   Out of this mess, it is possible to discern positivedevelopments. President F.W. de Klerk, who is the key toSouth African reform, has acted decisively in the face of thescandal, demoting two senior cabinet ministers. He hasreplaced them with men from a younger generation, both with aclear record of opposing apartheid.   The ANC could still scotch progress if it thinks that itcan now exclude Inkatha from the South African future. Andthe ANC's recently announced negotiating team includes aginghardliners such as Joe Slovo.   But on the positive side, the team is led by CyrilRamaphosa. Mr. Ramaphosa calls himself a socialist and hislinks to the South African Communist Party are unclear. Buthe is from the wing of the ANC that remained in the countryand did practical work while the ANC radicals were touringuniversity campuses in the West.   Mr. Ramaphosa has had the courage to condemn WinnieMandela. He has organized a non-racial local authority inPretoria, including black moderates who had been ostracizedby more radical members of the ANC. His work as head of theNational Union of Mineworkers has won the grudging respect ofmuch of the white business community.   It never pays to be too optimistic about the ANC. Justwhen Nelson Mandela verbally renounces communist economicplanning, his Congress adopts radical economic rhetoric. Its&quot;Cultural Desk&quot; is contemplating positions that would forbidAfrikaaners from writing in their own language under an ANCregime.   Inkathagate doesn't alter the fundamental situation.Inkatha is a legitimate organization that must play a role inthe negotiations. The ANC seems unable to embrace democraticliberalism. President de Klerk remains a force for positivechange. South Africa is still a place where progress comesslowly, and scepticism toward all factions is rewarded.</TEXT></DOC>
