The Navy released a report Thursday that said gunner's mateClayton Hartwig ``most likely'' caused the April 19 explosion thatranks as the worst U.S. naval disaster since the Viet Nam war.   Hartwig attended Lakewood Seventh Day Adventist Elementary schooland graduated from Mount Vernon Academy, a Seventh Day Adventistschool in Mount Vernon, Ohio.   Seventh Day Adventists are vegetarians who neither smoke nordrink alcohol and coffee. They attend church on Saturday and believein the second coming of Jesus Christ.   Harvey Allison, maintenance director at of the co-educationalschool of 140 students about 40 miles northeast of Columbus, saidHartwig worked for him part of the day, doing manual tasks andsupervising students, and went to classes the other half of the day.   ``He was religious and a devoted worker,'' Allison said Thursday.``Whatever task he did, he did it efficiently _ he got good grades.''   Allison said he did not believe the Navy's report. ``They got ascapegoat. They have to blame it on someone and he is not here todefend himself,'' Allison said.   While attending the academy, Hartwig enjoyed camping and theoutdoors, but his heart was set on joining the Navy, Allison said.   ``He went straight into the Navy (after graduation) because itwas his love. He came back once a year to see the students,''Allison said.   Hartwig's sister, Kathleen Kubicina, said Seventh Day Adventistsdo not believe in violence or the firing of guns, but the familyallowed Hartwig to join the service because he had a great desire todo so.   Ms. Kubicina said Hartwig had a girlfriend, Charlene Meter, andhe wrote her a number of letters while he was aboard the Iowa.   Copies of 11 letters written by Hartwig were provided to TheAssociated Press by Ms. Kubicina. Ten were written to Ms. Meter andone was written to his parents.   ``For the last 6 yrs, all I've known is the Navy,'' wrote Claytonin a Nov. 8 letter. ``I'm military through and through and at timesit's hard for me to get along with civilians.   ``I guess it's like this. I have no idea what goes on in yourlife in college. Your problems from day to day, your frustrations,the people you can't stand, what you do. It's the same for you withme. There's no way you could understand what it's like to live in acramped ship and be at sea for months at a time,'' he wrote.   Following the explosion, at the request of the Navy, the FBICenter for Anaylysis of Violent Crimes conducted a psychiatric studyand found that Hartwig was disturbed and under a lot of stress,``virtually insuring some type of reaction. In this instance, it issuicide.''   Hartwig and gunner's mate Kendall Truitt, 21, each bought $50,000life insurance policies from the Navy credit union just before theIowa left for the Persian Gulf in 1987.   Truitt since has married and has denied suggestions he wasinvolved in a homosexual relationship with Hartwig.   Hartwig's family rejects the enquiry's conclusion and is callingfor a congressional investigation into the Navy's handling of theIowa probe.</TEXT></DOC>
