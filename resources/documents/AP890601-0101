(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man convicted only of manslaughterfor shooting his estranged wife, a judge, to death in hercourthouse chambers should get the stiffest possible sentence,angry protesters said.   A thousand people rallied Wednesday outside the county Hall ofJustice to protest the manslaughter conviction of former policeofficer Clarence Ratliff in the death of District Judge CarolIrons. Irons, who has been described as a supporter of victims offamily violence, was killed last October.   On May 11, a jury acquitted Ratliff of first-degree murder,which carries a possible sentence of life in prison without parole.Ratliff, 53, had testified that he was drunk and upset over theirimpending divorce and did not mean to kill Irons, who was 40. Thelesser charge of manslaughter carries a possible sentence of up to15 years.   But the jury also convicted the 21-year police veteran ofattempted murder for firing at two officers who tried to help Irons.   ``We are outraged that the murder of a woman is considered lessserious than shooting at _ and missing _ two men,'' said oneprotester, Dotti Clune. She described the jury's decision as a``slap-on-the-hand verdict.''   ``Carol Irons was not manslaughtered. She was murdered,'' saidanother speaker, psychologist Sherry Redding.   More than 1,000 letters have been sent to Kent County CircuitJudge Dennis Kolenda, urging the maximum allowable prison term atRatliff's June 12 sentencing.   Attempted murder carries a possible sentence of life in prisonwith possibility of parole. But Michigan Attorney General FrankKelley has recommended that Ratliff be sentenced to 25 to 40 yearsin prison because those sentenced to life can be paroled after 10years and those who get 25 to 40 years generally serve at least 20years.   The protesters did not specify the sentence they want the judgeto give but said it should be the harshest possible.   Kolenda said he was reading each letter.   ``A judge has to walk a tightrope,'' he said after the rally.``Some decisions must be made by the letter of the law and somedecisions must take into account community sentiment.''</TEXT></DOC>
