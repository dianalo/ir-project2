Nynex reported that it revamped much of its unregulatedbusinesses, and took charges totaling $211 million. Thecompany revalued its Nynex Business Centers, reorganized theoffice systems division within its Business InformationSystems Co., and restructured several software-relatedoperations.</LP><TEXT>   The New York-based telephone company said it is nowsearching for &quot;a strategic alliance&quot; for the Business Centersto strengthen their position in the microcomputer systems andservices market. The Business Centers, purchased in 1986 fromInternational Business Machines Corp., were profitable duringthe fourth quarter, but a spokesman said:&quot;We think the bestway to grow the business is to seek an alliance withcompanies that have skills complementary to our own.&quot;   For the quarter, Nynex reported net income of $60.7million, or 30 cents a share. That compares with a loss of$43.7 million, or 22 cents, the year before when the companytook a $325 milllion charge for equipment write-downs, astrike by its unions, changes in its benefit plan and anearly-retirement program for managers. Revenue rose 2.3% to$3.44 billion from $3.37 billion the year before.   Without the one-time charges, net would have been $271.7million, or $1.36 a share, down from $281.3 million, or$1.42, in the 1989 quarter.   Wall Street applauded the Nynex news as a positive step toeliminate losses. Nynex shares rose 75 cents to close at$68.50 on volume of 708,200 shares in New York Stock Exchangecomposite trading. Other Bells also gained, including U SWest, up 50 cents to $36.125, on 626,700 shares; Ameritech,up 75 cents to $64.125 on 347,500 shares; Southwestern Bell,up 75 cents to $51, on 1.2 million shares; and Bell Atlantic,up 50 cents to $48.125 on 362,100 shares. During the pastweek stock prices of Baby Bells have been hammered byinvestors suprised by the slow rate of growth reflected inthe earnings reports. BellSouth, last of the seven Baby Bellsto report results, is expected to do so next week.   William Ferguson, Nynex chairman and chief executiveofficer, said in an interview that steps taken in 1990 havepositioned the company for growth. The one hitch is theNortheast's soft economy. &quot;What I don't feel good about rightnow is the economy,&quot; he said.   Nynex has been coping with a downturn that began near theend of 1987 in New York and in 1989 in New England. &quot;We'vebeen living with it for quite some time,&quot; he said, &quot;and Iwould feel very good about the first half of 1991 if we couldsee some uptick in the economy.&quot; Nevertheless, he said that&quot;all of the business units we have are profitable&quot; and willremain so.   For the year, Nynex reported net of $949.4 million, or$4.78 a share, up from $807.6 million, or $4.10 a share.Revenue rose almost 3% to $13.6 billion from $13.2 billion in1989. The company's return on equity rose to 10.22% from ananemic 8.40% the year before. Excluding one-time charges,1990 earnings would have been $1.21 billion, or $6.08 ashare, up 6.8% from $1.13 billion, or $5.75 a share, in 1989.   The number of customer telephone lines grew 2% to 15.3million at the end of 1990 from 15 million in 1989. Meantime,the number of cellular customers grew almost 22% in 1990 to259,000 from 213,000 at the end of 1989.   Jack Grubman, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said Nynexexecutives &quot;have made a conscious decision to exit businessesthat lose money,&quot; a step that will wipe out about 30 cents ashare in losses. In addition, he said, the company &quot;will seean uptick sooner than the other Bells&quot; once the economy turnsaround. That's because Nynex, unlike its siblings, has beencontending with a recession for a long time and its growthrate has stabilized.   In Denver, U S West reported that earnings rose 1% to $348million, or 89 cents a share, from $344.4 million, or 92cents, a share, the year earlier. Revenue grew 3.9% to $2.64billion from $2.54 billion in the 1989 quarter.   The company said the number of customer telephone linescontinued to grow, increasing 2.8% in 1990 to 12.6 millionaccess lines. U S West also reported that minutes of usebilled to long-distance companies rose 6.8% from 1989.Increases in revenue and earnings produced by the growth,however, were offset by cuts in local and interstate rates.   Dick McCormick, U S West president and chief executive,predicted that 1991 will be &quot;a challenging year even thoughwe expect the economy of our 14-state region to outperformthe national economy.&quot; U S West, he said, plans &quot;to continueour increased investment in our domestic telecommunicationsbusiness and in our international communications activities.While some of these investments will limit short-termearnings growth, we believe they will add long-term value forour shareowners.&quot;   For all of 1990, U S West reported earnings of $1.2billion, or $3.11 a share, up almost 8% from $1.11 billion,or $3.01 a share, for 1989. The per-share numbers reflect atwo-for-one stock split distributed May 2, and an equityissue of 16.1 million shares in 1990's second quarter.Revenue rose 2.8% to $9.96 billion from $9.69 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
