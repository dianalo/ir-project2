The events of 1986ensured a higher production level for OPEC Member Countries that yearthan in the previous year, when OPEC production fell to 15.4 millionbarrels a day. Despite this increase in production there was a noticeablerise in OPEC's petroleum reserves which reached 644.5 billion barrels,thus bringing the Organization's share to almost three-quarters of totalworld oil reserves. This rise in OPEC reserves took place despite thecollapse in prices and the 18% fall in drilling activities in OPEC MemberCountries in 1986 compared to 1985, thus underscoring the fact that thepossibilities of finding new oil in OPEC Member Countries are greaterthan elsewhere. Little or no change was registered during the year inOPEC's production and consumption of refined products: these stood atfive million and 3.1 million barrels per day, respectively. OPEC alsoimproved its natural gas position, with 1986 proven reserves amountingto 40,633 thousand million cubic metres. They marketed 52% of their 1986production which stood at 172,413 million cubic metres. 75 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
