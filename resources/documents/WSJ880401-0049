The government also appointed Claude Boivin, 54, to be president and chief operating officer of the Montreal-based utility. Mr. Boivin is currently executive vice president, operations, at Hydro-Quebec.    The appointments take effect May 2.    Messrs. Drouin and Boivin will succeed Guy Coulombe, who announced earlier his intention to quit as Hydro-Quebec's president and chief executive.    The government said it believes a division of responsibilities of the top jobs at the giant utility will lead to improved management. Mr. Drouin will be responsible for the utility's general administration and direction, while Mr. Boivin will be in charge of operations and management of its facilities.    Mr. Drouin was appointed to a five-year term at an annual salary of 180,000 Canadian dollars ($145,692), and Mr. Boivin to a three-year term at 160,000 dollars a year.    Separately, the government said it approved an average 3.9% rate boost, effective May 1, for Hydro-Quebec, which had sought an average increase of 4.2%.    Residential customers will pay an average of 3.9% more, compared with the 4.9% boost in that category sought by the utility. Rate increases for other users will vary between 3.5% and 4.2%. </TEXT></DOC>
