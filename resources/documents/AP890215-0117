Intel's N-10 chip is the main source of excitement at theIntegrated Solid State Circuits Conference in New York, the biggestresearch meeting of the year for the world semiconductor industry.   Intel was not permitted to discuss the commercial uses of the newchip in its technical presentation today. But in an interviewafterward, Intel senior vice president David House said the companysees the N-10 as the basis for a major new line of computers.   Some analysts had predicted the Intel chip would be offered onlyas a helper chip to Intel's main microprocessors, such as the 80386and forthcoming 80486 that are the brains of personal computers.   But House said the chip also would be offered as the mainprocessor in engineering and graphics workstations andmulti-processing computers. Other companies, with Intel's help,could build computers around the N-10, House said.   An announcement of the availability of the N-10 is expected bythe end of the month, probably at a Feb. 27 news conference in SanFrancisco.   Analysts have said Intel's chip could be a fearsome competitor tospeedy processor chips from Sun Microsystems Inc., Motorola Inc. andMips Computer Systems Inc.   Unlike those chips, Intel's chip can handle instructions thathave a ``word'' length of 64 bits, twice as long as the 32 bits usedin competing chips.   The 64-bit word length is what entitles Intel to call the N-10 asupercomputer on a chip, because mainframes and supercomputers alsouse 64-bit words.   ``This is the first microprocessor product, when it is formallyintroduced, which will be a true mainframe computer,'' James I.Magid, a senior adviser to the securities firm Needham andamp; Co., saidin an interview.   ``The N-10 is a major event. It's had a lot of excitement builtup around it and it does appear to be the highest-performanceprocessor soon to be available,'' Michael Slater, editor ofMicroprocessor Report newsletter, said Tuesday in advance of thepresentation.   As a helper chip, the N-10 could handle the ``grunt work'' ofhigh-speed, repetitive calculations while a computer's mainprocessor handled more complex tasks, said Dean McCarron, amicroprocessor expert at In-Stat Inc. in Scottsdale, Ariz.   It probably would take a personal computer equipped with the N-10and Intel's forthcoming 80486 microprocessor a few seconds torecalculate a long electronic spreadsheet, instead of the minute itwould take on today's fastest PCs, McCarron said.   The N-10 is built with so-called Risc technology, for reducedinstruction set computing, so it could not be used as a replacementfor the microprocessors used in industry-standard personal computers.   Until today, Intel's only public statement on the N-10 was abrief abstract of its paper, in which it said the chip has a peakspeed of 150 million operations a second. That is five times fasterthan Risc chips designed by Motorola and Japan's Fujitsu Ltd.   Aside from the Intel chip, researchers also are expectingannouncements from Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.of new generations of microprocessors, according to Mark Horowitz, aStanford University chip expert.</TEXT></DOC>
