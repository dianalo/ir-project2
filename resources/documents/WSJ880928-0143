By dialing 1-900 and a seven-digit code, a caller could receive information on a wide range of topics from sports scores to stock quotes, or could make reservations, place orders for merchandise or make a pledge in response to a fundraiser. The 900 service will also allow callers to select from a &quot;menu&quot; of options by voice or by pushing buttons on their telephones.    MCI is testing its 900 program with a small group of customers and expects to begin full service in the second half of 1989. American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Corp. already offers 900 service that allows callers to listen to recorded messages or vote in a public opinion poll.    The caller's cost, generally a flat fee, would be determined by the MCI customer. MCI will bill the caller for that fee, and it will keep a portion of its collections to cover transmission charges, passing the rest on to its customer.    Stuart Mencher, senior vice president of sale and marketing for the Washington-based long-distance telephone company, said it is difficult to project revenue. MCI, he said, is the only company offering interactive 900 service and its portion of the emerging market, which is estimated to climb to more than $2.5 billion by 1992, is likely to exceed its 15% share of the overall long-distance business.    Mr. Mencher said MCI's 800 service, which it began last year, is &quot;still growing at an explosive rate,&quot; and that the introduction of the 900 service is part of MCI's effort &quot;to provide customers with a family of inbound services&quot; they can use for sales and marketing programs.    Among other services, MCI can provide its 800 and 900 service clients with callers' phone numbers. Companies can then match those numbers with readily available data bases to come up with names, addresses and other information.    Separately, MCI said beginning Saturday it will extend to all MCI Card users world-wide direct dialing. </TEXT></DOC>
