SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The giant plumes blasted into the sky byvolcanoes may look like ordinary clouds, but they containengine-clogging ash that can pose disaster for unsuspecting aircraft.   To avoid dangerous events like those that forced two airliners toland with engine malfunctions in 1982, a pair of federal agencies islaunching a new volcano watch program for aviators.   The volcano alert project was announced Thursday by the NationalOceanic and Atmopsheric Administration and the Federal AviationAdministration, although a formal start-up date was not set.   Over the years, major volcanic eruptions have spewed vast plumesof ash to high altitudes where it was spread widely by strong winds.   In one case in 1982, ash from Galuggung volcano in Indonesiacaused engine shutdowns in Boeing 747 airliners on June 23 and onJuly 13. Both planes were forced to land when their enginesmalfunctioned after being coated with the glass-like ash.   More than 20 volcanic eruptions have been reported beneath theNorth Pacific air routes between North America and Asia in just thepast five years.   Active volcano areas include Italy, Greece, New Zealand,Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, Alaska, the Pacific Northwest,Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, East Africa, Hawaii and theCaribbean.   Volcanic ash plumes can spread as high as 60,000 feet and,especially at night, it can be difficult for a pilot to tell when acloud is being entered.   In the new warning program, NOAA weather satellites, pilotreports and other sources of information will be used to watch forvolcanic eruptions. The U.S. Geological Survey and the worldwideScientific Event Alert Network operated by the SmithsonianInstitution will also assist.   While weather satellites are expected to be the primary source ofinformation, scientists stress that in the early stages of aneruption it can be very difficult to tell the difference between ashclouds and ordinary water or ice clouds. Heat imaging satellitesshould help in this area.   Once an eruption is detected, the FAA will be kept advised of thelocation, height and movement of ash clouds. The Civil AviationOrganization of the United Nations will also be informed of volcaniccloud movement so it can advise airlines from other nations.   The advisories will report height and plume movement at two-hourintervals and will provide short- and long-range forecasts of cloudmovement.</TEXT></DOC>
