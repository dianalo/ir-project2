Cathcart as their new boss: Some of his best friends are investment bankers.    The bad news: Mr. Cathcart bluntly tells these friends that he disdains their profession.    &quot;He thinks we're overpaid and underworked,&quot; says a Chicago investment banker who knows him well. &quot;Until you've run a manufacturing company, Si thinks you haven't earned your stripes.&quot;    Mr. Cathcart, former chairman of Illinois Tool Works Inc. and a long-time General Electric Co. director, was named Kidder's president and chief executive officer late last week as GE moved to take direct control of the Wall Street firm it purchased an 80% stake in a year ago. The appointment of Mr. Cathcart, practically unknown to everyone on Wall Street except analysts who follow the specialty tool and fastener concern he led for many years, stunned Kidder officials.    The shake-up, which included pushing aside Kidder's longtime chief, Ralph D. DeNunzio, who remains chairman, came after a GE investigation -- in the wake of insider-trading charges against one current and one former Kidder arbitrager -- found weak controls at the investment bank.    Those expecting an unsophisticated tool-and-die man with grease under his nails will be surprised. Mr. Cathcart, 61 years old, isn't an engineer and he ran Illinois Tool as a highly decentralized company where each major product was a separate operation. He built it into one of the best-regarded industrial-products concerns at a time when foreign competition sent many rivals sliding backward.    What's more, Mr. Cathcart was able to establish himself both inside and outside Illinois Tool as its unquestioned leader despite control of the company by Chicago's wealthy Smith family, some of whose members are still corporate officers. And in recent years, as a director for several large corporations, on two occasions he has been among the most vocal in telling management that they must give up their company to bidders with a fair offer.    Fellow GE directors say Mr. Cathcart is a quick study, and Robert C. McCormack, a managing director at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. and a director and major shareholder at Illinois Tool, predicts he will learn the ins and outs of Wall Street fast. Adds J. Ira Harris, senior executive director of Salomon Brothers Inc.'s Chicago office: &quot;Banking isn't as mysterious as everybody makes it out to be. Someone with good common sense will do well.&quot;    Mr. Cathcart, in a telephone interview over the weekend, wouldn't discuss his plans for Kidder. GE is expected to put more capital into Kidder later this year, but it is not clear how much or when. He also declined to comment on his view of investment bankers at this time.    However, an investment banker friend says Mr. Cathcart's view is in line with &quot;a general distrust in the Midwest toward Wall Street. 'Who the hell are these guys to tell me I should restructure my company,' someone like Si will joke. But there is a real feeling underneath that.&quot;    Mr. Cathcart wouldn't say how long he expects to be at Kidder, but taking the job clearly involves some personal cost. He'll resign from all seven of his corporate directorships &quot;to devote my full energies to Kidder,&quot; he said, and insisted he is not a caretaker. He is looking for an apartment in New York, where he'll be on weekdays, while keeping his home in Lake Forest, a Chicago suburb. Mr. Cathcart also owns a ranch and some small businesses in Cody, Wyo. For now, he doubts he'll be able to make regular visits there.    While each product line is separately managed at Illinois Tool, there were few layers between them and Mr. Cathcart, who retired as chairman last year. Robert G. Rettig, an executive vice president at the company, says Mr. Cathcart developed an informal management style where &quot;a lot of information passed in the hall.&quot;    The one black eye Illinois Tool got during his tenure was a $38.5 million investment in Ricks Exploration Co., an oil- and gas-drilling concern. Illinois Tool has written off more than half its investment. </TEXT></DOC>
