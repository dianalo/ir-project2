SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A new study concludes that skewing the CensusBureau's national headcount, as has been proposed in various formsby lawmakers and special interest groups, would make littledifference in the allocation of House seats.   Population shifts since 1980 are expected to result in the shiftof 18 or more seats, various experts agree.   But even combining the various suggested adjustments would shifta maximum of just four additional seats among California,Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Minnesota, population analyst William P.O'Hare reports.   ``It appears that none of the adjustments to Census figures thatare being urged upon the bureau are likely to make a big differencein the overall apportionment of Congress,'' O'Hare reported in thelatest issue of ``Population Today,'' the newsletter of the privatePopulation Reference Bureau.   The census, taken every 10 years, is required by theConstitution to redistribute the 435 House seats, keeping themrelatively even in population. Because the number of House membersis limited, whenever a state gains a seat, another state must loseone.   Last year the Commerce Department, which oversees the CensusBureau, decreed that the 1990 results would not be adjusted.Various interest groups, however, continue to push the idea.Several lawsuits and congressional bills have been filed seeking toforce changes.   The main dispute over adjusting the count centers on eitherincreasing the totals to add minorities presumed to have beenmissed or reducing the total to subtract illegal aliens or peoplewho are ``imputed.''   Imputed people are those counted despite the fact that Censusofficials do not actually contact them. For example, when neighborssay someone lives at a house even though the census takerrepeatedly cannot locate those people, that person is counted.   The suit contending minorities are undercounted was filed inU.S. District Court in Brooklyn by New York; Los Angeles; Chicago;Dade County, Fla.; the NAACP and groups representing Hispanics andthe nation's mayors.   A separate suit, seeking to remove the effect of illegal aliens,was filed in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh by the ImmigrationReform Law Institute on behalf of 42 members of Congress,Pennsylvania, Kansas, Alabama and the Federation for AmericanImmigration Reform.   An analysis of the 1980 census concluded that more than 5percent of blacks and Hispanics were missed, considerably more thanthe number of whites who were said to have been uncounted. Thus,interest groups have urged increasing the minority count in eachstate by a predetermined percentage.   Such a move would be expected to benefit states with largeminority populations, but O'Hare's calculations said that would notbe the case.   ``Interestingly,'' concluded O'Hare, ``minority undercountadjustment, the modification of the census figures which hasreceived the most attention, would not result in the movement ofany seats between states.''   On the other hand, he calculated that eliminating illegal aliensfrom the count would result in the transfer of one House seat fromCalifornia to Pennsylvania.   ``This is not surprising when you realize that the 1980 censusfigures for California included an estimated 1 million illegalaliens,'' O'Hare commented. Taking them out of the Californiapopulation would cost that state a House seat; Pennsylvania wouldbe next in line for that seat.   Some states are more difficult to count and thus have moreimputed people than others, O'Hare found. He estimated thatsubtracting imputed people from the count would cost Kentucky aseat. Once again, the gainer would be Pennsylvania.   O'Hare also calculated the results of various combinations ofthese adjustments:   _Adding in allegedly uncounted minorities and subtractingestimated illegal aliens would move one seat from Minnesota toPennsylvania.   _Adding in minorities and subtracting the imputed people wouldtransfer seats from Kentucky and Minnesota to Pennsylvania andCalifornia.   _Subtracting both illegal aliens and imputed people would moveone House seat from California to Pennsylvania.   _Making all three adjustments would move one seat fromCalifornia to Pennsylvania.   The various changes calculated by O'Hare would be in addition toreallocartions of House seats caused by discernable shifts inpopulation since 1980.   While the exact shifts won't be known until after the census,the Population Reference Bureau and the private Election DataService have projected changes based on recent Census Bureaupopulation estimates.   Both groups anticipate the shift of 18 seats from northernstates to the South and West, mirroring the flow of population.   Gainers are expected to be: California, 5; Texas, 4; Florida, 3;Arizona, 2; Georgia, 2; North Carolina, 1 and Virginia, 1.   Expected to lose seats are: New York, 3; Pennsylvania, 3;Illinois, 2; Michigan, 2; Ohio, 2; Iowa, 1; Kansas, 1;Massachusetts, 1; Montana, 1; West Virginia, 1, and Wisconsin, 1.</TEXT></DOC>
