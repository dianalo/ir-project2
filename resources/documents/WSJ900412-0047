Rothe, managing director for OTC trading for Alex.Brown andamp; Sons in Baltimore. Most investors flush with cash arecontent to &quot;just sit back and rifle shoot and takeopportunities when they see them,&quot; investing in bargains andselling on bad news, Mr. Rothe said.   Jerry Mullins, head of OTC trading at Dean WitterReynolds, saw retail buying outpace institutional buying atthat brokerage as investors favored the buy side. But by theend of the day, E.E. &quot;Buzzy&quot; Geduld, president of HerzogHeine Geduld Inc., said he saw institutional buying &quot;leaningtoward the sell side.&quot;   Mr. McCready of A.G. Edwards predicts today's market willdrift until the last hour of trading, when he suggests themarket may bounce up as traders who sold shares short rush tocover their positions in advance of the three-day Easterweekend. Short sellers borrow shares and sell them, bettingon a decline that will allow them to return the borrowedshares later at a profit.   MCI Communications closed off 3/8 at 36 1/8 after it wasreported that chairman and chief executive William McGowanunderwent exploratory chest surgery.

The company said a loweredearnings forecast by a Chicago Corp. analyst was largelyresponsible for the drop. The analyst slashed a fiscalthird-quarter earnings estimate for the company to about 40cents a share from a previous estimate of 60 cents, accordingto Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.   Amid positive earnings stories, Caere added 2 to 24 1/4after reporting first-quarter net income of 25 cents a share,up from 10 cents a year earlier.
