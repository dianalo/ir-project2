HIGGINS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Americans are unwise to threaten a troopwithdrawal from Europe because of differences with the West Germangovernment over short-range NATO nuclear missiles, Horst Ehmke, aleader of the West German Social Democratic Party, said today.   ``Let's stop all this nonsense about getting out and dissolvingthe alliance,'' Ehmke, deputy chairman of the SPD parliamentarygroup, told reporters at a news conference arranged by ForeignPolicy magazine.   Ehmke, in Washington for talks with members of Congress and theBush administration, said a majority of West Germans oppose U.S.plans to upgrade the Lance missiles.   The United States and Britain are leading an effort in the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization to replace the 88 Lance missiles,which have a range of 71 miles, with more powerful rockets thatwould come closer to the short-range limit of 310 miles.   All the main political parties in West Germany, includingChancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, have objected to the``modernization'' effort.   West German leaders also have called for negotiations with theSoviet Union to reduce or eliminate the weapons on both sides, butthe U.S. government has objected, claiming the missiles are neededto deter any attack from the larger Soviet Bloc conventional forces.   Influential members of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committeehave said that they might urge a withdrawal of United States forcesfrom Europe if the West Germans insist on increasing the risk tothe troops by removing the missiles.   ``It's not wise to hint and say that you will withdraw yourtroops,'' said Ehmke. ``The German people will feel like they werebeing blackmailed.''   He said the United States should back down from its refusal tonegotiate with the Soviet Union on reducing the short-rangemissiles in Europe.   ``I don't see any reason for the American fear'' aboutnegatiating, Ehmke said. ``The most dangerous position in thisrespect is the one the American administration is taking right nowby saying no negotiations.''   It would be much easier to negotiate while saying that anyreduction in the conventional and nuclear forces would have to beacceptable to both sides in Europe, he said.   ``It would be much easier to win popular support for a positionlike that than for the position the American government has now,''Ehmke said.   He said Americans shouldn't view their commitment to NATO aspurely to help the Europeans.   ``Your troops are over there not only for the protection ofGermany but for the protection of your own interests,'' he said.``You could not allow the Soviets to get influence over theEuropean coast of the Atlantic.''   ``On the other hand we like you to be there because we are notbig enough to do the job alone,'' Ehmke said. ``So it's in ourinterests. We need you to protect our sea and air lanes.''</TEXT></DOC>
