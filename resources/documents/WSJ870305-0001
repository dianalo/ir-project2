In a flurry of accusations and countercharges late yesterday, each company claimed the other had become an unreasonable obstacle to curing the federal antitrust objections that initially blocked the merger.    Hughes said it had conceived of a new, less-painful way to satisfy Justice Department concerns about the $1.2 billion merger, which would have created the world's largest oil-field services company. But Baker rejected this proposal &quot;for reasons Hughes doesn't fully understand,&quot; Hughes said. Baker called the solution Hughes proposed &quot;more burdensome,&quot; however, and added that despite several meetings on the matter, &quot;it hasn't obtained any satisfactory explanation from Hughes&quot; of its objection to a consent decree proposed by the Justice Department.    Baker made a point of saying that its suit, filed late yesterday, would be handled by Joe Jamail, a Houston personal-injury lawyer who won Pennzoil Co.'s $10.2 billion court judgment from Texaco Inc. Baker's lawsuit, filed in a state court here, demands an order forcing Hughes to complete the merger or, failing that, &quot;substantial monetary damages.&quot;    As previously reported, Hughes's directors had voted against merging with Orange, Calif.-based Baker under terms of a consent decree proposed by the Justice Department. The consent, to which Baker had agreed, would have required the concerns to shed certain drill-bit and pump businesses. Hughes' board rejected the consent, however, as &quot;unreasonable,&quot; saying that the businesses to be sold were too important to the combined companies and the conditions of their sale too onerous and risky to make the merger worthwhile.    Baker yesterday rejected Hughes's complaints out of hand. The businesses to be divested, Baker said, would account for only about 3% of the combined enterprise's revenue.    Hughes made its new proposal to Baker after adjourning a special 10 a.m. CST meeting at which Hughes holders originally were to vote on the merger. The meeting resumed at 4 p.m. CST, only to be adjourned again while Hughes officials awaited a response. It came late in the day.    When holders gather again at 10 a.m. CST today, &quot;Hughes will adjourn the stockholders meeting without voting its proxies and will terminate the agreement with Baker,&quot; the company said. Baker yesterday asserted that it believed Hughes holders were prepared to &quot;overwhelmingly approve the combination.&quot;    Hughes called its ill-fated proposal of yesterday a &quot;fix-it-first approach,&quot; in which the antitrust objections to the merger would be cured before the combination occurred, not after. The Justice Department had ordered the sale of Baker's Reed domestic tri-cone drilling bit business, for instance, to occur within 90 days; failing that, the sale would be conducted by a trustee &quot;owing no duty&quot; to the holders of the combined enterprise, in Hughes's words. Hughes proposed instead to have the sale take place prior to the merger's closing, which had been scheduled to occur by April 22.    Hughes said that yesterday's proposal, as well as the decision to terminate the merger agreement, was made by a committee of outside directors before being unanimously ratified by the full board. That means that the decision to call off the transaction must have been supported by Hughes's 18.5% shareholder, Borg-Warner Corp., which is represented on Hughes's board. Initially, Borg-Warner had urged Hughes to merger with Baker.    Between the two adjournments of yesterday's meeting of Hughes holders, analysts continued to speculate that Hughes had cooled to the loss of its independence as a result of the stabilization of oil prices since the merger was proposed last fall. A Hughes spokesman pointed out, however, that the company's internal oil-price projections -- on which all its drilling forecasts are based -- had remained unchanged since the merger was proposed.    After learning that Hughes had called off the deal, one analyst asserted that Hughes management lately may have grown intent on preserving management jobs as well. &quot;It appears that some of the management group has gotten to the ears of the board, most of which is outside directors,&quot; said Earl Stolz of Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Freidrichs Inc., New Orleans. &quot;They got into the middle of this and realized Baker was going to be the ruling faction,&quot; he said.    Twelve of 20 directors of the combined enterprise would have been supplied by Baker, as well as two of the top three executive positions, including chairman. Hughes has hotly contested suggestions that it opposed the merger on any grounds other than the terms of the consent decree.    Hughes apparently recognizes the struggle it faces to recover as an independent company in the worst drilling downturn of postwar years. The company said last night that a special board committee was appointed to begin a search for a chief operating officer -- an open position at the company -- to create greater &quot;depth of management.&quot;    &quot;The intent is to beef up our management to whatever level necessary to make Hughes a viable company,&quot; the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
