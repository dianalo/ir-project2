The zone, the first of its kind in Iran, will be on Qeshm,the largest island in the Persian Gulf and close to thestrategic Strait of Hormuz. Foreign investors can own up to100% of projects on Qeshm. The Iranian mines and metalsminister, during a visit to Dubai, said the Qeshm zone ispart of Iran's $120 billion plan to reconstruct its economy,shattered by eight years of war with Iraq.   The zone has already granted work licenses to Japanese andGerman companies. A Japanese company will set up a plant toproduce four million tons of steel a year while a Germancompany is building a power station to supply electricity tothe island.   Separately, the Russian republic and Iran signed an accordto strengthen ties and speed up projects already under way,Tass news agency said.                                                                                                          ARGENTINA SELLING UTILITY                                                                                                          Argentina published a request for &quot;expressions ofinterest&quot; in Servicios Electricos del Gran Buenos Aires. Thegovernment is now the only shareholder in the electricutility, which was created in 1958. This transactioncomprises the sale of the utility's distribution andmarketing services, which will be divided into twofranchises. Its electricity-generation services will beprivatized at the same time.                                                                                                          ASYLUM-SEEKERS IN EUROPE                                                                                                          Amnesty International criticized many European countriesfor putting up what it called unfair barriers againstasylum-seekers fleeing possible torture and execution. TheLondon-based human rights group said it expected tighter lawsas European Community members coordinate immigrationpolicies. The report, which focuses on EC countries, saidthese governments tend to treat asylum-seekers as illegalimmigrants and not as people escaping persecution.                                                                                                          THREAT TO MEXICAN COCOA                                                                                                          Thousands of acres of trees in Southern Mexico from whichcocoa is harvested are threatened by emissions fromstate-owned oil refineries in the area, an official atMexico's Department of Agriculture and Water Resources said.Cacao growers in areas near Petroleos Mexicanos refineriesharvest half the amount of cocoa and cocoa butter as dofarmers in other areas, said the official, quoted by theNotimex news agency. He said the refinery emissions causeacid rain. Cocoa and cocoa butter are used to make chocolateand other products.

The valueof the contract wasn't given.                                                                                                          TAIWAN-CHINA NUCLEAR DUMP                                                                                                          Taiwan authorities approved a plan to discuss with Beijingthe possibility of storing nuclear waste on several islandsoff southeastern China, a spokesman for Taiwan's AtomicEnergy Council said. The dump site would accommodateradioactive waste from nuclear power plants in both China andTaiwan. Chinese officials have expressed interest in offeringa location in exchange for free use of the site, thespokesman said, whereas Taipei will have to pay rent to theprivate Taiwan company that builds the site.                                                                                                          JAPAN-EC TRADE                                                                                                          The European Community will present Japan with a list ofdemands on trade and investment, Frans Andriessen, ECCommission vice president for external affairs, said inTokyo.   Mr. Andriessen said the list will form a basis fornegotiations on bilateral trade, an official of Japan'sMinistry of International Trade and Industry said. Mr.Andriessen was speaking at a meeting with Japanese Trade andIndustry Minister Kozo Watanabe.   A document, expected to be compiled at the annual Japan-ECsenior officials' meeting next spring, will list Japan'stelecommunications, satellite, auto parts, and other marketsas those that the EC finds hard to enter, the official said.   The proposal came as the EC grows impatient with itswidening trade deficit with Japan, which reached $23 billionin the first 10 months of 1991. Mr. Watanabe respondedpositively to the proposal, saying that Japan will prepare asimilar document, the official said.
