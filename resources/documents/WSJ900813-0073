For immediate practical purposes, the mayor beat thefederal case against him by escaping with a conviction ononly one misdemeanor cocaine-possession count. The juryacquitted him of another possession charge and was deadlockedon 12 other counts. Mr. Barry, cheered by supporters atweekend appearances, is said to be considering another runfor public office, most likely for an at-large city councilseat.</LP><TEXT>   But the fact remains that the mayor -- who for years haddenied drug-related allegations and preached abstinence incity schools -- was found guilty of cocaine possession, andhis lawyer conceded to the jury that Mr. Barry indulged inthe drug.   The city will long be haunted by the image of its chiefexecutive admitting to criminal activity, said JackFriedenthal, dean of George Washington University's lawschool. Also, Mr. Friedenthal added, &quot;You are left withterrible feelings, terrible divisiveness on the racialissue.&quot;   The eight-week Barry trial not only shook up the city, buthad reverberations as far away as Colombia, where politicalcommentators interpreted the verdict as an endorsement oftolerance that would undercut efforts in that country tofight cocaine trafficking, violence and corruption.   The white U.S. attorney, Jay Stephens, portrayed the trialresults as justification for a massive federal investigationof the mayor and his associates. Even the lone conviction,the prosecutor said, &quot;emphatically emphasizes that no one isabove the law.&quot;   But as Mr. Stephens spoke Friday outside the U.S.courthouse near the Capitol, a black crowd nearly shouted himdown with warnings to &quot;get out of town&quot; and chants of &quot;Barry,Barry, Barry] Four More Years]&quot; After the mayor delivered anemotional apology to supporters at a foot-stomping rallySaturday, arguments broke out on the street between whitesand blacks.   Mr. Barry, though appearing humble about his personalfailings, stopped well short of admitting to any criminalguilt. At his rally Saturday, he reiterated charges thatwhite prosecutors and journalists had singled him out forracial reasons. Some civil rights leaders, including BenjaminHooks, also have contended that the Justice Department hastargeted Mr. Barry and other black politicians.   &quot;My trial has helped expose deep divisions and racism inour community that are reflective of what is happening aroundthe nation,&quot; Mr. Barry said.   &quot;American citizens,&quot; he continued, &quot;should not have towalk around in fear that their constitutional rights andcivil liberties are being eroded and trampled, and BigBrother is all powerful and all knowing.&quot; Prosecutors all theway up to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh have denied thatthe Barry prosecution was racially motivated.   Much remains unclear about the city's political future andthat of its three-term chief executive. Mr. Barry isn'texpected to reverse his decision not to seek re-election asmayor, but he hasn't committed himself on whether he will runfor the city council, where he served in the 1970s. Today isthe deadline for Mr. Barry to switch his party registrationto independent from Democratic to qualify for the Novemberballot. If he does switch, he would have two weeks to decidewhether to run.   Another Barry campaign would almost certainly stir racialanimosity and keep the spotlight on the propriety of thefederal government's tactics in prosecuting him. Lawenforcement officials said that continuing investigations ofcity contract abuse have been stalled by the Barry verdictand could be derailed altogether if U.S. Attorney Stephensdecides not to retry the mayor. On the other hand, Mr.Stephens has said that the government held back on bringingsome charges against Mr. Barry, and it is possible that theprosecutor could seek a new, even broader indictment.   Mr. Stephens said he won't reveal his decision until ahearing scheduled for Sept. 17. Prosecutors said they willinterview jurors to find out whether the panel came close toconviction on any of the 12 drug and perjury counts on whichthey deadlocked.   Weighing against a new prosecution was the account of oneof the few jurors who answered reporters' questions over theweekend. Johnnie Mae Hardeman said that after eight days ofdeliberation, the panel had split 6-6 or 7-5 for acquittal onthe three felony perjury counts, although she didn't recallthe results in detail.   City Council Chairman David Clarke, a Democratic candidatefor mayor, said, &quot;I'm very sorry for this city that the mayorhas been found guilty on the one charge.&quot; But Mr. Clarke, whois white, urged the prosecution &quot;to let the city go,&quot; and notretry Mr. Barry.   Mr. Friedenthal of George Washington University said, &quot;Thepoint has been made: He {Mr. Barry} used cocaine.&quot; The legalacademic predicted a plea bargain under which Mr. Barry wouldadmit to another misdemeanor or two in exchange for theprosecution's dropping all other charges. Judges inWashington rarely, if ever, sentence first-time drugposession offenders to jail.   Mr. Barry's lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, said, &quot;It is timefor each side to extend the olive branch.&quot; But his success inturning the tables and putting the federal government'stactics on trial may prompt his client to refuse any pleaagreement.   Mr. Mundy dispatched the prosecution's evidence that themayor used cocaine on more than 200 occasions by simplyadmitting that Mr. Barry was an occasional user. In effect,the lawyer invited one or more findings of guilt on thelesser possession counts as a compromise, while stressingthat the government witnesses all &quot;had something to gain&quot; bycooperating with prosecutors.   Among the charges on which the jury couldn't agree was thepossession count based on a videotaped sting that caught Mr.Barry smoking crack in a Washington hotel room. He had beenlured there and encouraged to use the potent cocainederivative by a former woman friend cooperating withinvestigators. Mr. Mundy painstakingly guided the jury indissecting the 82-minute videotape, building a defense thatthe mayor had been entrapped.   The prosecution's failure to convict even with filmedevidence of Mr. Barry's drug use will certainly demoralizesome federal and local police in Washington, law enforcementofficials predicted. But investigators here and elsewherearen't likely to drop tactics such as undercover stings andreliance on testimony from witnesses themselves implicated incriminal activity. &quot;In a dirty business, you deal with dirtypeople,&quot; said one federal investigator.</TEXT></DOC>
