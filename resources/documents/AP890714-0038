Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Judiciaryconstitutional law subcommittee, said Thursday legislation wouldprobably reach the House floor before Congress' August recess tooverturn the Supreme Court decision.   But he said it probably wouldn't be the constitutional amendmentsupported by President Bush. Edwards said the proposed amendmentmight be ``reckless'' in its current form because it doesn't detailwhat would constitute desecration of the flag or shape the penalties.   Edwards and other key Democrats, including House Speaker ThomasS. Foley, D-Wash.; House Judiciary Committee chairman Jack Brooks,D-Texas; and Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Joseph Biden,D-Del.; propose regular legislation designed to meet the court'sconcerns.   But in the Senate, Republicans are insisting the amendmentdoesn't get second-class treatment. And House Republicans say theycan force their amendment out of committee if the panel tries tohold it up.   Republicans and some Democratic conservatives say theconstitutional amendment is the only way to ensure the court rulingis overturned.   ``Even experts who do not favor a constitutional amendmentapproach say that a legislative approach would not work,'' HouseRepublican leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., told Edwards' subcommittee onThursday as congressional hearings on the flag issue began.   Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., the chairman of the HouseVeterans Affairs Committee, called for passage of the amendment.Without it, he said, ``people will be burning flags throughout thecountry on every holiday occasion'' drawing strong reactions,especially from veterans.   ``People are going to get hurt,'' he said.   While many liberals object entirely to a flag constitutionalamendment as a threat to the Bill of Rights, Biden told the panel hewould support an amendment if a simple statute didn't work. But hesaid a statute could enacted far more quickly, since it doesn'trequire ratification by the states.   Biden, who plans to begin hearings in his committee soon, decriedthose who were trying to take political advantage of the flag ruling.   ``The easiest thing in the world to demagogue is the flag,'' saidthe former presidential candidate.   Michel, who appeared alongside Montgomery, insisted it was not apartisan issue and he said those who feared weakening of free speechrights were wrong.   ``I have more faith in the strength of the Constitution and inthe common sense of the American people than to believe that theFirst Amendment can be weakened by protecting the flag,'' he said.   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said the push for aconstitutional amendment was being driven by politics and not any``threat to this nations values or security.''   ``We are engaged in a crude form of political one-upmanship -- acrass competition about who loves the flag more ... with a cold eyetoward the next election,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
