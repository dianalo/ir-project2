<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-19-1090 </DOCNO><TEXT>Extended spent fuel storage is an important activity for all countrieswith nuclear programmes because fuel after its discharge from the reactoris required to be stored before reprocessing or final disposal. The storageperiod is highly dependent upon the individual national strategies tocomplete the nuclear fuel cycle. The results and experience gained inthe co-ordinated research programme ''BEFAST'' (Behaviour of Spent FuelAssemblies During Extended Storage), which was performed from 1981 to1986 under the auspices of the IAEA, were so important for the participatingcountries that the IAEA already in September 1986 initiated this newfollow-up programme ''BEFAST-II'' (Behaviour of Spent Fuel and StorageFacility Components During Long-Term Storage). Together 16 organizationsfrom 13 countries (Argentina, Canada, Finland, Germany, F.R., GDR, Hungary,Italy, Republic of Korea, Japan, Sweden, UK, USA and USSR) joined theprogramme. The research activities going on in each participating countrycan be grouped under three major topics: (A) long-term behaviour, (B)surveillance, and (C) facilities and operation, which also form the basisof the BEFAST-II final report ''Research, Development and Practice forthe Extended Storage of Spent Fuel''. The BEFAST-II CRP will be carriedout during the years 1987-1991, so that the final report could be completedby the end of 1991. The first Co-ordinated Research Meeting will be heldin April 1988 in Budapest, Hungary. Two other CRP meetings are tentativelyplanned to be held in September 1989 and March 1991. The working proceduresof the BEFAST-II CRP will be agreed upon during the Budapest meeting.The general goal of the programme is to provide a forum for free informationexchange on spent fuel matters between specialists in member countries.(author). 2 refs, 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
