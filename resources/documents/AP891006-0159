The legislation, approved on a voice vote, also would encourageinternational sanctions against violating countries.   In addition, it requires the president to monitor efforts byIran, Iraq, Libya, Syria and other developing nations to develop oracquire chemical and biological weapons.   The approval comes on the heels of a proposal made by PresidentBush before the United Nations to cut U.S. and Soviet stockpiles ofsuch weapons by 80 percent. The Soviets countered with a proposalfor total elimination.   U.S. sanctions include a cutoff of arms sales, an embargo onimports from the violating country, an end to credit guaranteesfrom the Export-Import Bank, a halt to financial assistance fromU.S. banks and an end to military and economic assistance.   The United States would also encourage a denial of assistancefrom international lending institutions as well as other sanctions.   The bill says that as many as 20 countries are capable ofproducing chemical weapons and that by the year 2000, at least 15developing countries will have the ability to produce ballisticmissiles capable of delivering the weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
