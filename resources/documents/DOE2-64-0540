<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-64-0540 </DOCNO><TEXT>The central detector of the upgraded UA2 experiment at CERN includes acylindrical tracking and electromagnetic preshower detector which employs1 mm diameter scintillating fibers as the sensitive medium. The deviceis two meters long and extends from 38 to 44 cm in its radial dimension.Sixty thousand fibers are arranged in 24 cylindrical layers, the outersix preceded by 1.5 radiation lengths of lead, permitting the localizeddetection of electromagnetic showers. This design was made possible bythe development of plastic scintillating fibers with attenuation lengthsof over 1.5 m and with a light yield sufficient to assure a detectionefficiency greater than 90% for minimum ionizing particles traversingthe fiber at any point along its 2 m length. In this article we describethe fabrication and performance of the fibers, the assembly procedureused in the construction of the detector, and the degree of uniformityachieved.</TEXT></DOC>
