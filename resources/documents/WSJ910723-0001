At stake is not just the $10 billion in loanguarantees that Israel had requested to help settle the waveof Soviet Jewish immigrants, but also the $3 billion a yearthat Israel now gets in military aid and debt forgiveness.Accepting Mr. Baker's invitation may or may not be a wiseidea from the point of view of Israeli security; Israeliscan, however, stop worrying about Mr. Baker's unspokenthreat: The loss of U.S. aid would be a blessing for Israel'seconomy.   In the 42 years since the establishment of the state ofIsrael, the U.S. has given Israel $47.5 billion in aid; allbut $2.8 billion of it since 1975. The $3 billion a yearIsrael now gets amounts to fully 6% of Israel's grossnational product. If philanthropic donations from Jews inother countries are counted, the value of foreign assistancegrows to 12% of Israel's GNP.</LP><TEXT>   What has been the result of all this generosity? A groupof Israeli economists recently pondered that question in astudy for the Israeli International Institute for AppliedEconomic Policy Review in Tel Aviv.   Arnon Gafny, who served as governor of the Israeli centralbank from 1976 to 1981, suggests that Israel is sufferingfrom what economists call the &quot;Dutch disease.&quot; A temporary&quot;gift of nature,&quot; like the Dutch natural gas fields orIsrael's external aid, may confer benefits for a limitedperiod, but will often impair a country's competitivenessover the long term by encouraging it to spend beyond itspeople's own means.   Prof. Moshe Syrquin of Bar Ilan University observes thatIsraeli economy did pretty well until 1972, a period whenU.S. aid was minimal. As aid increased, output andproductivity slowed, and resources shifted from investment toconsumption. Aid enabled Israel to live beyond its means: aidhas jumped to 76% of the value of Israel's trade deficit in1987 from 24% in 1970. It has also enabled Israel to maintaina sizeable welfare state: Government spending consumes morethan 80% of gross domestic product; in 1970, before the aidbegan to flow, government spending took only 33% of GDP. Atleast in the Israeli context, Mr. Syrquin concludes, foreignaid permitted distortions in the economy to persist bypostponing the necessity for domestic economic reform.   U.S. aid has enabled Israel to avoid the normal disastrouseconomic consequences of statism. Government plays anenormous role in the Israeli economy. Not only does it spendnearly four-fifths of the society's wealth, but the publicsector employs more than 40% of the work force. Subsidies offood prices, farm incomes, housing, health services, credit,industry and transportation consume $5.5 billion each year,or about 10% of GNP -- more than defense, whose share of GNPhas dropped to 8.5% from 11.5% in 1981. The taxes to pay forthese subsidies are crushing: more than 56% of earnings. Taxevasion is estimated at $3 billion a year, and the blackeconomy is generally supposed to account for one-quarter ofnational output.   U.S. aid has also saved Israel from the necessity ofconfronting its ubiquitous trade union movement. Israel'sunions enforce archaic labor laws that have cut output peremployee to half the level that obtains in most industrialeconomies. A two-day general strike called by the Histradrut,Israel's federation of unions, in June 1990 to protesteconomic reform pulled 800,000 workers out of their jobs,costing the economy more than $100 million.   Israel's unions are also major investors, owning nearlyone-third of the economy. Many Histradrut enterprises aremoney-losers, but the unions have been able to extractgovernment bailouts, as well as generous subsidies of theirsick fund-bailouts that the government might have beenconsiderably more reluctant to attempt in the absence of U.S.aid.   Israel could easily survive without U.S. aid, if itadopted free-market policies. The Tel Aviv Chamber ofCommerce calculates that Israel's choking trade restrictionscost Israelis $2.5 billion a year in higher prices. (Eventhough wages average about one-third U.S. wages, the cost ofliving in Israel is higher.) If that's correct, free tradewould offset 80% of the cost to the economy of a total U.S.aid cutoff.   Israelis could recoup even more of the money lost by anaid cutoff if they took the advice of Alvin Rabushka, aHoover Institution fellow who directs research at theInstitute for Advanced Strategic and Political Studies inJerusalem. Mr. Rabushka has prepared an alternative statebudget for Israel that slices $3 billion off Israel's $12.5billion in non-defense government spending, by slashingsubsidies and axing unnecessary programs, especially inindustry and agriculture.   Israel could even eliminate the need for its requested $10billion in settlement assistance -- if indeed that assistanceis needed at all -- by selling some portion of itsnationalized assets. The Israeli government owns 190companies that are collectively worth at least $15 billion.On top of that, it owns 93% of all the land.   With such attractive alternatives, why does Israel swallowits pride and beg for aid from abroad? Why do its politiciansmaintain economic policies that retard growth?   A free market economy would undermine the way Israel'sugly political system works. If ministers of the governmentwere deprived of the opportunity to appoint party hacks tohighly paid positions in state-owned enterprises, they wouldlose an important means of building and maintaining personalconstituencies. Losing the power to direct state funds to areligious school here, a bus line there, or a clinic overyonder would deprive them of the traditional currency ofIsraeli elections.   It's important for both Israel's supporters and itscritics in the U.S. to understand that Israel is dependent onU.S. aid only because of its foolish economic-choices. Themoment that the U.S. ceases to pick up the yearly overdraft,Israel will be forced to change its ways. Israel'spoliticians, to do them justice, do put the security of thestate ahead even of their appetite for power, and if thatsecurity requires privatization and budget cutting, thenprivatization and budget cutting is what they will do.   Many observers believe that economic change in Israel canonly follow political reform. In fact, the economic shock ofan aid cutoff could well precipitate political reform --particularly a stronger executive and the abandonment of thedecrepit political system that gives tiny extremist partiesveto power over national policy. At the moment, there is nochance of serious political reform because nearly every facetof life -- even sports -- is touched by government's spendingpower. The moment the market rather than politicians decidespeople's economic fate, the existing political parties andtheir complex systems of patronage will be superfluous; theprincipal obstacle to reform -- the complexinter-relationship between political parties and civic life-- will have dissolved.   Unconditional U.S. aid has been a very mixed blessing forIsrael. It has genuinely made life easier for Israelis in theshort term, but it has also underwritten self-destructivepolicies. Once Israel's Dutch disease is cured, healthytissue -- the private sector -- can grow and prosper. And aneconomically healthy Israel would be free to decide to acceptor decline Mr. Baker's &quot;invitations,&quot; without fear of losingits allowance from Uncle Sam.   ---   Mr. Bainerman is a Jerusalem-based journalist whospecializes in Middle Eastern economic issues.</TEXT></DOC>
