However, it has not been possible to establishrealistic and credible dose-response relationships, primarily becauseof the authors inability to define which constituents of the aerosolsproduce or initiate the pathological responses. It is generally acknowledgedthat the responses are associated with the fibers rather than the nonfibroussilicate mineral of the same chemical composition. Available data fromexperimental studies experimental studies in animals exposed by injectionand inhalation to fibers of defined size distributions are reviewed,along with data from studies of fiber distributions in lungs of exposedhumans in relation to the effects associated with the retained fibers.It is concluded that asbestosis is most closely related to the surfacearea of retained fibers, that mesothelioma is most closely associatedwith numbers of fibers longer than {similar_to} 5 {mu}m and thinner than{similar_to} 0.1 {mu}m, and that lung cancer is most closely associatedwith fibers longer than {similar_to} 10 {mu}m and thicker than {similar_to}0.15 {mu}m. The implications of these conclusions on methods for fibersampling and analyses are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
