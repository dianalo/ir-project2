Economic reform cannot succeed if it proceeds by fiatfrom Moscow.&quot; With the Soviet Union having been declaredofficially dead on Sunday and the Communist Party relegatedto history, the conditions for real change are at hand.   Triumph, however, hasn't been soothing for Westernofficials. Two worries keep them up at night: That in themidst of a winter of starvation, food riots would prompt someNapoleon to attempt a military takeover; and that during thecurrent disorder, some reckless leader might get control ofand use a nuclear weapon. We're glad of Western attention tothese dangers, but excessive focus on these risks also canobscure more positive trends.</LP><TEXT>   Last month, tanks did in fact return to the Russianparliament building. They'd been ordered there to serve asprops in a movie an American team was making about the Augustcoup. Those inside the parliament building complained thatthey'd been able to defeat the real coup in three days butthe movie making was dragging on for weeks.   The decision to deploy real tanks with real troops for themovie was a show of confidence by Mr. Yeltsin, but it wasalso a symptom of the public mood. Resistance to the Augustcoup has entered public mythology; a few thousands resistedoutside the parliament in August, but now you can scarcelyfind a Moscovite who won't claim to have been there. It isunlikely that many residents of the capital would see anothercoup as a solution to their problems.   More important, the military itself has seen how anattempted takeover can turn into farce. Many commanders wouldlack confidence that their units would follow orders atcrucial moments and not side with the people. Then there'sthe question of who to topple -- Yeltsin? Kravchuk? All 15republics at once? All the people on the streets of Moscowand St. Petersburg?   The backers of the presumed coup would be the militaryindustrial complex. That phrase lends false coherence to whatis really a disorganized set of apparats and factorymanagers. They haven't been sitting still these past fewmonths, but have been stealing party money or privatizingproperty for their own use. Thousands have made themselvesrich. Their representatives in the Russian parliamentsupported the Yeltsin economic reforms. Since they now ownmost of the goods, they are happy to see prices rise. Many ofthe old networks, the arteries of a coup conspiracy, havebroken down.   Soviet officials have been spreading coup warnings, butthey have always been pessimistic, and now may beexaggerating coup fears to win hasty Western aid. The Westshould stand ready to aid in the event of an emergency, butnothing should be done until price reforms take effect.Suppliers are holding goods off the market until the fullprice rises go into effect. Flooding the market with goodsprematurely would artificially deflate prices next year andsuppress incentives to produce.   Most people in the large cities, where hunger could leadto unrest, have food stockpiles. The elderly and thedisorganized are the ones who face hunger. The problem isdistribution. For the rest, the main concern is heat, thoughamid all the talk of an energy shortage we can't helpnoticing that traffic jams in Moscow are worse than ever.Western intelligence should keep its ears open of course, butgovernments shouldn't be stampeded into rash moves bydisaster scenario.   As for the nuclear weapons, they are dangerous things. Butamid the disorder, there is some good news. Among the fournuclear nations of the former Soviet Union -- Russia,Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Byelorussia -- there are no conflictsremotely resembling a Yugoslav situation, let alone one thatcould conceivably go nuclear. The commonwealth accord betweenthe three Slavic nations underlines the cooperation thatexists. All have repeatedly assured the West that they intendto live up to all arms-control agreements, and Ukraine wantsto become a nuclear free zone.   Measuring the strength of the former Soviet military isdifficult. We're told that the Soviet navy has dramaticallyreduced the number of ships at sea to save fuel. Ukrainewants to create a 400,000-member army, a reduction from thenearly 1.5 million men on its soil. But we suspect even thatfigure was part of the government's effort to reassureUkrainian arms manufacturers that they will still have anarmy to supply. Closing down those plants will be difficult;many are in one-industry towns.   The outstanding problems include figuring out ways toprevent nuclear engineers from sharing their knowledge withthe Saddam Husseins of the world, and how to respond tosmaller conflicts in places like Azerbaijan.   The West indeed has a direct interest in all this. It isthat the political institutions of this huge land mass shouldnot again assume a structure wholly inconsistent with thoseof the Free World. The decision to base the new Slaviccommonwealth in Minsk symbolizes Russia's move toward theWest. The welcome trend toward integration with thepolitically civilized world is more likely if the West'sleaders publicly and creditably make clear their faith inmarket reforms and the democratic process.</TEXT></DOC>
