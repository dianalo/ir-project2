For the biggest myth in Washington's wacky power structure is that the Office of Management and Budget exists to cut budgets.    As an agency head with control over the fourth-largest budget authority in the government during the four years of President Reagan's first term (director of the Office of Personnel Management from 1981 to 1985) I can testify that OMB never once tried to cut the budget I submitted to them. Rather the reverse. OMB constantly urged me to increase the amount of our budgets, often to the degree of tens of billions of dollars higher than was warranted.    The true functions of OMB, as any good economic conservative should know, are self-preservation and to preserve the system within which it operates. OMB exists upon the claim that a president must rely upon it, rather than the agencies, if he is to be successful. OMB must prove its worth by showing that the agencies are wrong. If an agency asks for too much money, OMB will demand cuts. But, if the agency asks for a little, OMB must show it matters by demanding more spending or spending on other things.    If an agency asks for little regulation, OMB will ask for much. If an agency asks for much regulation, OMB will ask for less. For OMB must tinker to exist. Otherwise, the president might realize that the only effective means of governance is cabinet government. Indeed, OMB is best understood as an excuse for not making cabinet government work. It is the old management error of substituting fat staffs for lean and efficient line operations.    Every agency political appointee who seriously tried to carry out President Reagan's mandate viewed OMB as the major impediment to achieving that agenda: Ray Donovan, Jerry Carmen, Tom Pauken, Jim Watt, etc. To read the quote from an associate of the former OMB director, who turned upon Mr. Reagan himself, &quot;Any place you had a bunch of Reaganites you had a problem,&quot; is like hearing Alger Hiss's lawyer complain about the FBI.    Actually, Mr. Bandow himself gives the game away. He says that OMB's power has faded since the administration's first year in office. Yet, the fact is that OMB was least in control that first year. They received so many suggestions for cutting government -- from the transition teams and the budget director (who was at that time still seriously trying to cut spending) -- that the bureaucracy was overwhelmed. Even then, I had to appeal personally to the top level of the political leadership at OMB to overrule a lower-level decision not to zero-out a grant program that I had set for extinction.    OMB is part of the budget problem, not the solution. It is part of the permanent structure of government, which is so in need of radical reform. Much sounder ground is to recommend a balanced-budget amendment, the line-item veto and a restoration of the president's impoundment powers as fundamental solutions to our serious spending problems. Congress, the national pressure groups and the bureaucracy (and this very much includes OMB) are at the heart of the problem, and only the people demanding fundamental reforms such as constitutional amendments can provide a real solution.
