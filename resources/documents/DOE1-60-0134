These areby no means significant crossings in terms of size and length. The longestcrossing that the author's brief research was able to uncover was a 4,700-foot,12 inch crossing of the Magdalena River in Colombia, which was completedin 1982. The largest diameter was a 1,700-foot crossing of the HoustonShip Channel with 40-inch pipe in 1979.</TEXT></DOC>
