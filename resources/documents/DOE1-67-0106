Irradiation was given with260 grade centigrade are technique photon beam from a Cobalt Unit; thetumor doses ranged from 52.5 to 65 Gy in 21-50 days, with a TDF between75 and 110. The analysis was conducted with the log rank test on thecumulative percent survival (CPS) at 5 years. The study pointed out theimportance of risk factors other than clinical stage on cumulative survivalin bladder cancer. Prognostic factors associated with a relatively succesfuloutcome (pandless;0.001) were the Karnofsky performance status (100 vs others)(CPS 75% vs 30%), the absence of ureteral obstruction on the initialintravenous pyelogram (CPS 50 % vs 35 %), a negative urine culture (CPS60% vs 30%), normal bladder capacity (CPS 50% vs 35%), low-grade histology(CPS 65% vs 35%), and grossly complete resection (55% vs 40%). The datafrom this analysis should be taken into consideration when radical radiotherapyis considered in new clinical trials. 16 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
