 The followingprovides highlights of these announcements:andM;EXTENSIONS TO ARCHITECTURE - COMMON PROGRAMMING INTERFACE SERVICES A newservice is added to SAA resource recovery.andP;  The Resource Recovery Interfacedefines services that enable the use of two-phase commitment controlprotocols.andP;  This enables changes to be made to multiple resourcessimultaneously or not at all.andP;  Two existing Common Programming Interface(CPI) services are enhanced.andM;The Communications Interface has been extended with Sync Point Services andthere is a new level of the Data Base Interface that includes protocols fordistributed relational data and enhanced support of ANSI, ISO and FIPSstandards.andP;  This new CPI level for the Data Base Interface includesReferential Integrity, common SQL return codes, and a PL/I interface.andM;SAA COMMON COMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT Four new architectures that were announcedin June 1990 are now implemented through new releases of IBM's SAA Data BaseManagers for the System/370 and System/390.andP;  Distributed Relational DatabaseArchitecture (DRDA) allows access and use of data residing in interconnectednetworks that have implemented DRDA; Distributed Data Management definescommunications interfaces and manages the routing of requests, replies anddata; Formatted Data Object Content Architecture (FD:OCA) provides aconsistent way to describe and exchange field-formatted data; and CharacterData Representation Architecture (CDRA), which ensures that all charactersand symbols have the same representation across any pair of SAA databasemanagement systems.andM;The new releases of DB2 and SQL/DS and a new version of Query ManagementFacility provide the additional distributed relational database capabilitiesof SQL/DS-to-DB2 or DB2-to-SQL/DS.andP;  The new version of QMF extends the SAAQuery Interface to CICS in MVS and allows users to query RepositoryManager/MVS.andP;  The new SAA LanguageAccess product provides a natural languageinterface to MVS and VM users.andM;TRANSACTION PROCESSING IBM's SAA transaction processing environments for theSystem/370 and System/390 have been enhanced with new releases of IMS/TM andCICS/ESA.andP;  IMS/TM now includes support for SAA Communications Interface andthe newly announced SAA Resource Recovery Interface.andP;  Additionally, theaffinity of CICS/VSE on VSE/ESA with SAA is being strengthened withadditional SAA elements in this environment.andM;SYSTEMVIEW Provides a framework for IBM and software developers to develop abroad range of integrated systems management solutions for SAA andmulti-vendor heterogeneous environments.andP;  Interfaces to applications arebased on SAA's Common User Access Graphical Model.andP;  SystemView products willcome from IBM and software developers, and will have an openly definedstructure for integration and navigation between systems managementfunctions.andM;SAA ASSET MANAGER IBM SAA Asset Manager/MVS is a key IBM SystemView businessadministration product within the SystemView structure.andP;  SAA Asset Managerefficiently manages enterprise hardware, software and related resources.andP;  SAAAsset Manager defines and automates enterprise business procedures via aprocess manager, supplies an open database definition and provides businessmanagement applications to be used within enterprise-defined businessprocedures.andM;SAA DELIVERY MANAGER This SystemView application provides a flexible means ofcustomizing, controlling, and delivering programs and files from an MVS or VMhost processor to IBM OS/2 programmable workstations.andP;  IBM SAA DeliveryManager may be used to manage customer programs and data, IBM licensedprograms and other vendor's programs, information, and files.andP;  Using SAADelivery Manager, end users may select packages to be delivered, installed,and/or updated on their workstation, or the host administrator can initiatedelivery, installation, and/or updating to end users' workstations.andM;AD/CYCLE Software Analysis Test Tool adds support for the OS/400 languages:C/400, COBOL/400 and RPG/400, as well as supporting VM C/370.andP;  WorkstationInteractive Test Tool provides enhanced OS/2 Presentation Manager support.andO;SAA ImagePlus --andM;SAA ImagePlus has been significantly enhanced with functions that will enablenew business solutions to take advantage of imaging and increase userproductivity.andP;  An OS/2 version of the ImagePlus Workstation program,providing a cooperative processing front-end to SAA ImagePlus MVS/ESA and SAAImagePlus System/400 and implemented to SAA CUA graphical model guidelines,provides a new level of end user interaction.andP;  IBM's ImagePlus applicationsare implemented to SAA standards.andP;  In addition, operating systems arerestructured to better support SAA cooperative processing: MVS/ESA includesAPPC and the SAA Communications Interface.andP;  VM/ESA is now a full SAA platformproviding all host SAA CPI elements.andM;PRINTMANAGER A new SAA PrintManager product for VM and MVS implements the SAAPrintManager Interface that was announced in August and provides a consistentmeans to request print services across the enterprise.andP;  It includes theability for OS/2 applications to print on Advanced Function Printers that areattached to the host.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
