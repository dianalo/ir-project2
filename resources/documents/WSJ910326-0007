Profit in the quarter fell only 0.3% to $3.13 billion. Butthe Insurance Information Institute noted that Hurricane Hugoand the San Francisco earthquake hurt results in the 1989quarter. Otherwise, the 1990 quarter's results would haveshown more of a deterioration.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;On the surface, it looks quite good, until you pull outthe effects&quot; of the 1989 catastrophes, says Sean Mooney ofthe institute. &quot;Then you see the deterioration in fundamentalunderwriting results&quot; in the 1990 quarter. Claims andexpenses related to the two catastrophes, which hurt thethird and fourth quarters of 1989, totaled $4.6 billion, Mr.Mooney says.   The industry recorded a pretax operating profit for thequarter of $3.46 billion, up 66% from $2.08 billion a yearearlier. The operating profit included underwriting losses of$4.75 billion, compared with a loss of $5.17 billion a yearearlier, and net investment income of $8.58 billion, up 7.3%from $7.99 billion. Investment income is primarily dividendsearned from stocks and interest earned on bonds.   However, realized capital gains for the quarter sank 73%to $328 million from $1.24 billion. Companies may have cutback on realizing capital gains because of the weak market,Mr. Mooney says.   The combined ratio -- a key indicator of the industry'shealth -- improved slightly, falling a percentage point to109.8%. The ratio measures total claims and expenses againsttotal premiums; a level below 100% indicates that insurersare bringing in more than they are paying out.   For all of 1990, net income fell 9.4% to $11.06 billionfrom $12.22 billion. Operating profit climbed 11% to $11.54billion, but realized capital gains dropped 39% to $2.82billion from $4.65 billion.   Although the 1989 figures included the impact of Hugo andthe San Francisco earthquake, underwriting losses in 1990widened 6.4% to $20.86 billion, and the combined ratio inchedup to 109.4% from 109.2%. Net investment income, however,rose 5.4% to $32.89 billion.   The figures are estimates for 96% of the U.S. property andcasualty insurers, based on data compiled by the InsuranceServices Office Inc. and the National Association ofIndependent Insurers.</TEXT></DOC>
