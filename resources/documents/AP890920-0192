Republican leaders predicted the Capitol Hill budget battle wouldpush past Congress' deadlines for enacting deficit-reductionlegislation, forcing nearly $17 billion in government-wide spendingreductions.   The House Democratic plan was modeled loosely on a proposal bySen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, to provide a 50 percent tax deductionfor money put into individual retirement accounts, said Rep. DanRostenkowski, D-Ill.   In addition, IRA contributions could be withdrawn without penaltyif the money were used for education or a first-time home purchase.   To pay for the IRA program and raise more money toward reducingthe deficit, the Democratic plan would raise to 33 percent themarginal tax rate for the nation's wealthiest taxpayers. Most nowpay a top rate of 28 percent on most of their income, even thoughsome in the upper middle class pay 33 percent on part of theirincome.   According to a study earlier this year by the CongressionalBudget Office, extending the 33 percent rate into the upper incomeswould raise $42.9 billion over the next five years.   The exact cost of the IRA tax break had not been determinedbecause details of the proposal were still being worked out.However, Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said it would be less than themoney gained from the upper-class tax increase and leave ``asignificant amount for deficit reduction.''   The Democratic leadership plan will be offered as an alternativeto the capital gains tax cut supported by Bush, House Republicansand a group of mostly conservative Democrats.   Republican leaders, after a meeting Wednesday with Bush at theWhite House, said it was almost certain Congress would fail to agreeon a deficit-reduction measure by mid-October, the deadline in theGramm-Rudman budget-balancing law.   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., the senior Republican on the budgetcommittee, said the cuts would total about $16.8 billion, half fromdefense and half from domestic programs.   The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law requires Congress and thepresident to reduce the deficit to within $10 billion of the $100billion 1990 deficit target by Oct. 15 or cuts are mandated to bringthe deficit down.   However, the lion's share of the deficit reduction needed thisyear is contained in the big budget bill carrying the capital gainsprovision and a host of other contentious issues, including childcare and revisions to the catastrophic health insurance program.   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said there was a``somewhat bleak prospect'' for averting the spending cuts.   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., speaking after themorning meeting, said Bush was firm in his opposition to a tax rateincrease to help raise revenues to offset the deficit.   To propose such an increase is ``to guarantee a veto,'' as isinclusion of add-on spending projects that Bush opposes.   ``If, in fact, it has a child care bill that is unacceptable, andif it has pension proposals that are unacceptable, he'll veto it.''   Meanwhile, senators of both parties met for more than an hour andRepublicans agreed to consider a Democratic proposal to add $1billion to the war on drugs with money saved through a .425 percent,across-the-board cut in all federal spending programs.   The two sides were negotiating not only in an effort to pay forthe drug war but to get appropriations moving again on the Senatefloor. Republicans have stalled action on the money bills with 10days before the start of the new fiscal year as means of gainingleverage in the dispute over the narcotics program.   Democrats initially sought a 0.5 percent, across-the-board cut asa means of finding $2.2 billion to add to the drug war, mainly inthe realm of prevention, education and treatment. The Bushadministration balked at that on grounds that it would hit too hardat the Pentagon.   The Democratic plan really was a counterproposal to a Republicanoffer made earlier of a 0.25 percent, across-the-board cut combinedwith targeted spending reductions in specific programs.   Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., the chief Republican negotiator,said afterward that the meeting was ``all very positive.''   ``It certainly narrows the gap in many ways,'' Hatfield said.</TEXT></DOC>
