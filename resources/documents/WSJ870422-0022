Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) is scheduled today to discuss his budget proposal with top White House officials. According to his aides, he hopes to convince the president to compromise somewhat on his opposition to a major tax increase in return for some growth, after inflation, in military spending for fiscal 1988, which begins Oct. 1.    The senator's plea comes just days before the Senate is expected to consider a budget resolution devised by the Democratic majority. It would raise taxes by $18.5 billion, reduce projected military spending by $6.9 billion and cut projected nonmilitary spending by $10.3 billion in fiscal 1988.    Sen. Domenici's alternative would set the tax increase at about $10 billion, somewhat more than the $6 billion contained in the president's own budget plan. It also would allow for a real increase in military spending next fiscal year, though not as much as the president wanted.    Both the Domenici plan and the Democrats' plan would leave the deficit about $36 billion above the $108 billion target for fiscal 1988 in the Gramm-Rudman law. Both, however, would reduce the deficit by about $37 billion, and purport to bring the budget into balance by fiscal 1991, which is the goal of the deficit-cutting statute. </TEXT></DOC>
