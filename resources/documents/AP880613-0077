(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Authorities using death certificatesand toe tags have identified dozens of decaying bodies foundstacked in a funeral home, some for years, but a coroner said someof the identities may never be known.   ``There will be about 10 that no matter what we do we will notbe able to identify them,'' Chief Medical Examiner Peter Lipkovicsaid Sunday. ``One doesn't have a head or legs, so even if we had adental chart, what could we do?''   Officials on a routine inspection discovered eight of the bodiesearly last week and another 36 were found Friday at Howell MorningGlory Chapel, which had the city contract for handling the bodiesof indigents.   Twenty-six boxes containing cremated ashes also were found atthe funeral home. The state Department of Professional Regulationsuspended owner Lewis Howell's license after the initial finds.   Meantime, the painstaking process of identifying the remainscontinues.   A clerk from the Vital Statistics office at the state Departmentof Health and Rehabilitative Services put in overtime this weekendpulling death certificates for investigators.   ``We entered names into the computer, playing a matching game,''Lipkovic said.   Means of identification also have included hospital bracelets,Medical Examiner's toe tags and medical appliances such as hippins. Labels on cremation boxes were used to identify 26 sets ofremains.   By Sunday, officials had identified 49 of the 70 remains at thehome. There were leads on identifying many of the remaining bodies,Lipkovic said.
