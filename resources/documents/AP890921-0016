The protein deposits appear in several tissues, including theskin and intestines, indicating they may come from an unknownsubstance that circulates in the blood, said Dennis Selkoe,co-director of the Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham andWomen's Hospital in Boston.   If so, finding ways to block delivery to the brain may help infighting Alzheimer's disease, he reported today.   But he said it is too early to know if such an approach would beuseful. And another scientist said the research provides onlysuggestive evidence for the idea that the protein deposits come froma blood-borne source.   David Drachman, chairman of the medical and scientific advisoryboard of the Alzheimer's Association, also said it is unproven thatthe protein's appearance in the brain plays any role in causingAlzheimer's.   Nonetheless, he called the study ``a very important advance'' inknowledge about the protein, which is called amyloid.   Selkoe, who is also associate professor of neurology at HarvardMedical School, reported the findings in the British journal Naturewith colleagues Catharine Joachim and Hiroshi Mori.   Even if no circulating substance is involved in the proteindeposits, the work suggests that doctors may one day be able toconfirm an Alzheimer's disease diagnosis by taking skin samples,Selkoe said in an interview.   Drachman said data from the study suggest such a test would beunreliable, but that perhaps the accuracy can be improved.   Alzheimer's disease attacks the brain and produces progressiveimpairment in memory, thinking and behavior. It kills more than100,000 Americans a year. No cause or cure is known.   Doctors now have no standard biological test to confirm thediagnosis in a living patient. They can only rule out other possiblecauses, including treatable ones, for suggestive symptoms.   A standard feature in the brain of Alzheimer's victims is a largenumber of spherical neuritic plaques, composed partly of the amyloidprotein.   Scientists do not know whether the plaques cause the disease orsimply result from it.   Brains of Alzheimer patients also contain deposits of amyloidalone, which is what the new study found in other tissues, Selkoesaid.   Eight of 11 Alzheimer patients showed patchy amyloid deposits inthe skin, subcutaneous tissue or intestines, with suggestiveevidence of such deposits in two others.   Three of 26 people without Alzheimer's showed the deposits, withtwo showing equivocal evidence.   The three with deposits were at least 77 years old. Selkoe notedthat elderly people without Alzheimer's also can have plaques in thebrain, although they have fewer plaques than Alzheimer patients.   The findings imply that the amyloid deposits either are createdindependently at multiple sites in the body or derived from somesubstance that circulates in the blood, he said.   Selkoe said he favors the latter idea. Other kinds of amyloidcome from such a circulating precursor, and some newly founddeposits were in or near blood vessel walls, much as they can appearin the brain, he said.   Nobody has yet identified a circulating substance that can bedemonstrated to give rise to the form of amyloid linked toAlzheimer's, Selkoe said.   He also said further study is planned to see if skin samplingmight be useful to confirm a diagnosis of the disease.</TEXT></DOC>
