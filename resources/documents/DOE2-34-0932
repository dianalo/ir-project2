Threekind of anode were tried. Many highly ionized medium mass ions (up toC/sup 4+/, O/sup 6+/) accelarated to several times of voltage differencebetween anode and cathode were observed. In the case of all insulatoranode the current carried by the medium mass ions is about half of thatcarried by protons.</TEXT></DOC>
