An ATandamp;T spokesman said he didn't know if the SEC's inquiryrelated to an investigation into Teradata stock activity. Hesaid the agency asked ATandamp;T &quot;to provide a chronology of eventswithin ATandamp;T leading up to the announcement of theacquisition, including when did the company give the go aheadto begin negotiations with Teradata and a list of the {ATandamp;T}people who were aware of our plans before the announcementwas made public on Monday.&quot;   An SEC spokesman wouldn't confirm or deny whether theagency was investigating Teradata stock trading. Teradatadeclined comment.   In the few weeks prior to Monday's merger announcement,Teradata traded between $20.50 and $21.125. On Nov. 22, thecompany's stock jumped to $21.75 on volume of 510,800 shares,more than double normal activity. On Nov. 27, the day beforeThanksgiving, Teradata rose $1.75 to close at $22.75, thenadded another dollar a share Friday, the last trading daybefore merger negotiations began, to close at $23.75.   By Tuesday, the day after the announcement, Teradatatraded at $29 on volume of 2.8 million shares. Yesterday,Teradata closed at $29.125, up 12.5 cents in nationalover-the-counter trading.   NCR, based in Dayton, Ohio, said it had negotiated themerger agreement after getting a go-ahead from ATandamp;T's board.NCR has collaborated with Teradata and currently holds 9.4%of the company, a stake that was transferred to ATandamp;T when NCRwas acquired. Teradata is considered a pioneer in theleading-edge computing technology called &quot;massively parallelprocessing,&quot; a design that NCR has incorporated into itslatest, most powerful computer line.   Executives of NCR met with Teradata executives lastweekend and quickly put together the agreement, according toNCR. The merger pact was approved Monday by both companies'boards. However, it must still be approved by Teradatashareholders. NCR said it expects to complete the mergerwithin two to three months.</TEXT></DOC>
