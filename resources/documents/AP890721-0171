The Boeing 727 was traveling from Frankfurt, West Germany, toNew York via Keflavik, Iceland, on a routine flight to transportthe aircraft, said Alan Loflin, a Pan Am spokesman in New York.   He said the pilot reported the fault over the Atlantic andreturned to London for repairs.   Loflin said the aircraft had two other hydraulic systems thatcould be used to control it, and even if they had failed it couldhave been steered manually. The incident was ``nothing close to anemergency,'' he said.   Fire engines and emergency services lined Heathrow's main runwayas the jet touched down, but Loflin said emergency service had notbeen requested.   A United Airlines DC-10 lost its tail engine, then its hydraulicsystem, and crashed Wednesday at Sioux City, Iowa, while trying tomake an emergency landing. At least 109 people were killed and 184survived, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
