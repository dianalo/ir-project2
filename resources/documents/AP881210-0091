Cavazos appearsto be bracing for criticism over cuts in school support whenPresident Reagan presents Congress with his final budget next month.   Cavazos, who promised at his confirmation hearing to fight for``the best funding possible,'' now says only ``I did the best Icould'' in arguing for education money.   He did not disclose any figures for his department, but Office ofManagement and Budget officials have said they cut $35 billionacross the government to hold the deficit to $100 billion inReagan's lame-duck blueprint for fiscal year 1990.   Cavazos, the junior member of Reagan's Cabinet and one of theholdovers who will serve in President-elect Bush's Cabinet, wasasked in an interview with The Associated Press if the budget willreflect his principles.   The former Texas Tech University president hesitated thenreplied, ``I really don't know how to answer that. And I'm honestabout that. I did the best I could. That's all I can tell you. ...That's going to be the budget and that's the one that I willdefend.''   Cavazos said it is too soon to talk about what shape the budgetwill take in the Bush administration, or what programs he willlaunch to combat such problems as illiteracy and the steep dropoutrate.   However, Bush did make several detailed campaign proposals toboost education spending, including a new $500 million ``MeritSchools'' program to help the disadvantaged and $50 million formagnet schools.   Cavazos told the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee athis Sept. 9 confirmation hearing, ``I can promise this committee andpromise this nation that I will do everything I can to get the bestfunding possible for our Department of Education.''   In the interview, Cavazos, a former medical school dean who wassworn in to Reagan's Cabinet barely 12 weeks ago, said, ``Somepeople have been concerned that I've not come up with specificprograms on how to do that or do the other. I think it's prematurevery frankly.   ``I've said to people, `Look, I work for President Reagan untilnoon on Jan. 20. And I will bring all of my skill, my energies andmy commitment to that presidency. I signed on for that,'' he said.   ``But I'm also a holdover,'' he added. In the Bush administration``we will be getting into some rather specific kinds of programs.''   Cavazos, the first Hispanic to serve in the Cabinet, has cutquite a different figure than his brash predecessor, William J.Bennett, who made headlines with pungent criticism of teacher unionsand others running America's schools and colleges.   Cavazos has sought to mend fences with those same groups and toenlist them in what he hopes will be a national effort ofunprecedented scope to educate every child to his or her fullestpotential.   ``I really do believe that we are starting to come together,'' hesaid. ``The real change, meaningful change, comes about frombringing people together on these issues.''   ``I think that those battles that you win by logic, bydiscussion, by building a consensus, will in the long run be of moresubstance'' than those won by ``pounding on the desk or raisingCain,'' he said.   Asked if he shared Bush's desire to bring ``fresh faces'' togovernment, Cavazos said, ``Absolutely. We'll have 90 percentturnover'' in the top ranks at the Department of Education.   Cavazos said he thinks the public has not yet taken to heart theseverity of problems in its schools, despite the alarms sounded inthe 1983 ``A Nation At Risk'' report.   ``Although we have made some advancements, we've fallen back insome other areas'' since then, Cavazos said. ``We have not been ableto stem the tide of dropouts. Our literacy numbers are terrible.''   The American people ``must not recognize the seriousness of theproblem or else they'd have gone out and done something about it,''said Cavazos, son of a foreman on the King Ranch, one of the biggestcattle-raising operations in Texas.   What makes Cavazos think that he will succeed in solving theseproblems where others have fallen short?   ``I think that persistence has a lot to say about it. You justcontinue bringing it forth until finally it reaches the nationalconsciousness,'' he said. ``Just keep pushing. Persistence.''</TEXT></DOC>
