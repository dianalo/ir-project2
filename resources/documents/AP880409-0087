(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   White House chief of staff HowardBaker conceded Saturday that economic sanctions against Panama have``hurt the people more than they have hurt'' strongman Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega.   But Baker called the measures ``carefully thought out andcarefully executed'' and said they were unavoidable.   ``We grieve for the people of Panama'' Baker told reporters. Hesaid, though, that U.S. officials hope the new economic sanctions,announced on Friday, will further undermine Noriega's hold on power.   The chief of staff also acknowledged that a series of economicsanctions taken against Noriega to this point have had littleeffect on the general.   This contradicted Baker's statement of Friday, in which he toldreporters he thought the punitive measures by the United States hadleft the Panamanian strongman a ``beleaguered and de facto leader''of the Central American nation.   On Saturday, Baker acknowledged that the sanctions, for the mostpart, had wreaked havoc with the Panamanian economy.   ``General Noriega, no doubt, has money squirreled away, whoknows where, and, and I doubt very much that we have done much tointerrupt his lifestyle or to diminish his assets,'' the chief ofstaff said.   ``And it does hurt the people of Panama, and the people ofPanama are the ones that have been hurt for a long time by theauthoritarian rule of General Noriega and by his drug traffickingto their detriment,'' Baker added. ``And we regret that. ... We'reextremely concerned about not only the security of the canal andthe security of Americans, but also the welfare of the people ofPanama. ...   ``But the answer to that is the resumption of constitutionalgovernment in that country,'' he said, ``and it is our fervent hopethat that will occur soon and occur in a satisfactory way.''   Whereas a senior administration official early last weeksuggested that dissident elements in the Panamanian Defense Forcesmight force Noriega out, Baker indicated Saturday the invocation ofemergency economic powers by Reagan might invite the Panamanianpeople to demonstrate for Noriega's removal.   Baker said Reagan's decision to use the International EmergencyEconomic Powers Act to further impede the flow of U.S. dollars toPanama will have ``far-reaching consequences'' and said ``thepresident's hope is that it also will have a convincing effect onthe people of Panama and on General Noriega.''   But Baker acknowledged that the steps taken to put pressure onNoriega ``undoubtedly hurt the people of Panama more than they hurthim.''   Noriega has clung to power despite one coup attempt in Panamaand increasing political, military and economic pressure from theUnited States.   Baker said he did not put much stock in reports of Marxistintervention on Noriega's behalf, saying, ``I don't know thatthere's anything going on that's particularly alarming orparticularly different, but we're keeping very close touch withit.''   Last week, the Washington Times reported that an internationalMarxist brigade of up to 1,200 troops had gone into Panama to helpprotect Noriega. But U.S. officials said they had no confirmationof that.   Baker also refused to speculate on what options Reagan mightelect if the latest economic sanctions do not succeed.   ``The president of the United States does not signal in advancewhat his next steps, if any, will be,'' Baker said.   The chief of staff laid much of the problem in Panama toNoriega's alleged involvement with drug-peddling.   Noriega has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami ondrug-trafficking charges, and there have been some suggestionswithin the administration that the United States would not seek toextradite and try the Panamanian strongman if Noriega fled to athird country.   ``The drug component is bigger than almost anybody imagines,''Baker said, adding:   ``The international drug cartels are so big and so powerful andhave so permeated the governments of some of the countries of thishemisphere, that it becomes a threat to the national security ofthis nation.''   ``We are addressing that,'' Baker said. ``The president isaddressing the situation aggressively. The first lady (NancyReagan) has addressed it aggressively. It is a component in ourconcerns about Central America.''   ``It is not something that will be solved easily or quickly,''he said. ``It is a situation that, as we approach a solution, willproduce resistance from those who are deeply engaged in the drugbusiness. But the drug business is awful. The drug business isdestructive to our lifestyle and the security of this country, andwe've simply got to face it for what it is.''</TEXT></DOC>
