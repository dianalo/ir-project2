President Carlos Andres Perez blamed leftists for continuingVenezuela's worst unrest in 31 years of democratic rule.   El Nacional, an independent daily, said in its Friday editionthat 300 people had been killed and 1,500 injured in four days ofrioting sparked by bus fare hikes. The newspaper said the deadincluded at least four children, ranging in age from 3 to 14.   That raised the toll from unofficial estimates Thursday of 200dead and 800 injured in the rioting in the capital and at least 11cities nationwide.   Perez said after a helicopter tour of capital Thursday that thecity of 4 million people was returning to normal.   Witnesses said troops killed at least 20 people overnight in theEl Valle neighborhood south of Caracas in response to the slaying ofan army major by snipers.   Maj. Felipe Acosta Carles was leading a group of soldiers in ElValle Wednesday when he followed snipers to a secluded hut next to ahighway and was shot in a burst of gunfire, according to pressreports.   Fransisco Solorza, a journalist who lives in the neighborhood,said he saw at least 20 bodies being carried through the windingstreets of the neighborhood Thursday morning following nightlonggunbattles.   Photographers for El Nacional also said they saw at least 20bodies from that clash at the central Caracas morgue.   About 100 people ran down hills in western Caracas to shouttaunts and throw stones at the police and national guard units. Theauthorities opened fire, dispersing the protesters.   No report of casualties was given from the clash, which brieflyclosed two stations of the capital's subway system.   Perez declared martial law and an overnight curfew beginningTuesday, a day after increases in gasoline prices and transit farestouched off the violence.   An estimated 15,000 troops and 7,000 police maintained order inthe capital Thursday, and the president pronounced the emergency``practically over.''   But Perez said he was ``preoccupied and ashamed'' of the``absurdity'' of lost lives.   He said looters were only hurting themselves by destroying smallbusinesses that served poor neighborhoods, and blamed ``remnants''of leftist revolutionaries for continued gun battles in the capital.   ``These phantasmagorical remnants of subversives are still notconvinced this is a democratic country,'' said Perez, who has beenin office only a month.   He said some acts ``were induced, and this has to be punishedseverely.''   On Wednesday, Gabriel Puerta, a former guerrilla leader, accusedthe government of inventing political motives for the disturbances,which he blamed on the failure of the government's economic policies.   Mourners, some with black eyes and cuts from street violence,waited outside the central Caracas morgue Thursday for the bodies ofloved ones to be released.   Armando Rodriguez waited for the body of his 28-year-old brother,Francisco, who was killed by a stray bullet Tuesday while watchinglooters battle the army from the roof of his building west ofCaracas.   ``We were up on the roof, about 20 of us, when the army arrivedand started firing in the air to scare the mob,'' Rodriguez said.``I don't bear any grudges, but I would like to see an investigationinto my brother's death.''   The unrest is the country's worst since January 1958, when 100people were killed during the uprising that ousted dictator Gen.Marcos Perez Jimenez.   Venezuela, affluent during the 1970s thanks to its rich oilreserves, saw its fortunes slide along with petroleum prices in 1981.   Real wages have since fallen by one-third, inflation is expectedto hit 70 percent this year _ double the 1988 figure _ and theforeign debt is $33 billion, fourth largest in Latin America afterBrazil, Mexico and Argentina.   Bus fare increases of 30 percent to 50 percent and price gougingby drivers were the immediate cause of the riots and looting.   Two weeks ago, Perez announced a sweeping reform package underpressure from international creditors that includes lifting ceilingson interest rates, doubling gas prices and letting the currencyfloat, which means higher prices for imports.   Also Thursday, Perez announced plans for emergency credits forstorekeepers who lost millions from the damage and looting.</TEXT></DOC>
