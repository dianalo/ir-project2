Estimates of future resourcesare reviewed and appraised by utilizing available historical data, includingthe geologic and petroleum characteristics of the worlds various typesof producing basins. These potential resources most probably will befound in many of the presently productive areas, and in unexplored orfrontier basins, which are located primarily in the arctic regions, offshoreareas of the continental shelf, possibly deep sea, and many areas whichin the past, have been relatively inaccessible. Present worldwide geologicdistribution and per capita consumption of oil and gas reserves is notuniform geographically nor politically. Current estimates indicate thatfuture discoveries will include a greater percentage of relatively smalleraccumulations, more gas than in the past, and will probably not be uniformin distribution. For the world in general, it appears that the additionof new reserves of oil are less than growth in current consumption, whilenew reserves of gas presently exceed consumption; i.e. oil may be andless;andless;toppingoutandgt;andgt; while this point has not been reached by gas.</TEXT></DOC>
