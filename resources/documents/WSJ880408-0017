Bork.    Now, at an age when people often slow down, the 65-year-old writer-producer-activist is at it again on all fronts: financial, political, even personal, as he shakes off the collapse of a 29-year second marriage and a divorce settlement topping $110 million.    But most of all, Mr. Lear is proving himself a savvy and unabashed capitalist, busily buying movie theaters, television stations and magazines -- most of them obscure -- to expand his closely held ACT III Communications Inc.    Named for what Mr. Lear sees as the third act of his life, the two-year-old company has quickly become a well-rounded entertainment concern without the huge risks and lavish overhead typically associated with Hollywood.    Not that Mr. Lear was ever averse to risk. Only last fall he married for the third time, and now he is about to become a father again. People for the American Way, which he started eight years ago from scratch, is now about as big as Common Cause. And Mr. Lear himself is hard at work on a strange and secret TV project about what he calls &quot;a spiritual journey.&quot;    Mr. Lear's own journey took him to the pinnacle of power and success in Hollywood, only to see him retreat for several years. But unlike Shakespeare's king, Mr. Lear didn't fall back on the resources of his three grown daughters. Instead he started a new company, and now he is about to return to the medium he helped bring from adolescence into adulthood.    &quot;Some people took ACT III pejoratively, meaning it would be the last act,&quot; Mr. Lear says. &quot;But my life is a Shakespearean piece, and there are five acts. I look at ACT III as the middle.&quot;    Mr. Lear's business success is so striking because big names like Aaron Spelling, Dino De Laurentiis and others have tried to build multifaceted, public entertainment companies recently, only to falter after a year or two in business. Eschewing glitz and remaining private, Mr. Lear is a sharp contrast. His company has avoided competing with industry giants like MCA Inc. and has instead combined a liberal use of debt with a conservative acquisition strategy.    With stations like WRGT-TV in Dayton, Ohio, and magazines like Educational and Industrial Television, ACT III hasn't made glamour a priority. Mr. Lear also hasn't let his personal views, such as opposition to the religious right, get in the way of making money. &quot;All our stations carry paid religious programming,&quot; says ACT III President Thomas B. McGrath. &quot;If Norm was some kind of fanatic, he'd make us drop it all.&quot;    To his supporters, who see him as a lovable father figure, fanatic is the last word for Mr. Lear. He is a man of broad enthusiasms who seems to hug everyone he meets and who used to give out gift certificates for psychotherapy to friends and associates. Now that he is married to a psychotherapist, he gives gift certificates for a physical-fitness trainer.    The bane of conservatives, who castigate him for what they call a campaign of lies and distortion against Judge Bork, Norman Lear is feisty, thoughtful and rich, a maker of devoted friends and apoplectic enemies, a clown, a ham and a wise guy, a master at influencing opinion and an unrepentant activist who vows to keep fighting for his liberal beliefs without changing tactics.    Mr. Lear is hardest on his liberal critics, some of whom wish his ways were subtler. &quot;The right does not bend over backwards to appear fair,&quot; Mr. Lear retorts. &quot;That is a particularly sick phenomenon of liberals that I have no interest in.&quot;    An art collector, a fancier of Havana cigars and lately a bit of a dandy, Mr. Lear lives well but not lavishly -- at least by Hollywood standards. He hasn't always lived the good life, though. He grew up poor in New England, the son of a blustering and ill-starred father who spent three years in prison for securities malfeasance.    Mr. Lear says that his mother influenced him powerfully to oppose injustice, but his father left a mark both on his son and on American television. Headstrong and intolerant, Herman Lear often told his wife Jeanette to &quot;stifle yourself&quot; and called Norman &quot;the dumbest white kid I know.&quot; Norman rebelled, and Herman Lear later became a model for the bigoted Archie Bunker in his son's trailblazing series &quot;All in the Family.&quot;    Aside from ACT III, Mr. Lear says that he spends most of his time on his secret project, for which his research includes Emerson, Shaw and Thoreau. From the little he will reveal, Mr. Lear seems to be at work on a comedic &quot;Pilgrim's Progress,&quot; which he had hoped would make a movie but which will probably end up as a TV series.    &quot;We haven't seen much about a spiritual journey, and I wish to deal with that,&quot; he says. &quot;We're all embarked upon one, consciously or unconsciously.&quot; Why now? &quot;I met Shirley MacLaine in an elevator,&quot; he jokes.    Mr. Lear functions as something of a visionary himself, acting as a guiding light at ACT III and leaving operations to Mr. McGrath. ACT III won't disclose figures, but it is said to be profitable, with annual revenue well above $100 million.    The company has quickly achieved that, thanks to its careful game plan. Instead of bidding for television outlets in places like New York and Los Angeles, ACT III spent a frugal $60 million or so for five independent TV stations, each one dominant in growing midsized markets like Winston-Salem, N.C. Mr. McGrath says that ACT III plans to own 12 such stations, the legal limit.    &quot;It's an excellent strategy,&quot; says Steven Pruett, a managing partner at Blackburn Capital Markets, which specializes in financing broadcast acquisitions. &quot;The big markets are an ego game.&quot;    Similarly, ACT III paid around $47 million for two Texas cinema chains and now has about 100 screens, all far from the glamour markets where theater chains trade for a much higher cash-flow multiple.    Act III also owns about a dozen publications covering entertainment-related subjects, including Channels and Marketing andamp; Media Decisions. It considered buying the trade papers Variety and the Hollywood Reporter but wouldn't pay the price when both were sold recently for top dollar.    Mr. Lear's highly leveraged company -- it uses bank credit and private placements and has equity investors in some ventures -- is also in the movie business. It has already financed two films directed by Rob Reiner, &quot;Stand by Me&quot; and &quot;Princess Bride,&quot; both of which made money and pleased critics, and Mr. Lear recently assembled a new production team to make more films.    Mr. Lear doesn't talk much about the business, referring the subject to the 33-year-old Mr. McGrath, who says that his boss delegates easily, has a keen eye for trends and has great contacts. Mr. Lear also has weaknesses: Mr. McGrath cites the &quot;problem of whimsy&quot; and Mr. Lear's penchant for rumination, which he says has cost ACT III some opportunities.    Nevertheless, ACT III is succeeding without the single component for which Mr. Lear is known best: television production. Mr. Lear is now assembling a TV production team, but he won't run it himself. Instead, he says, he wants to concentrate on creating shows, particularly his &quot;spiritual journey&quot; program, which is likely to stir things up in some quarters.    Despite his current emphasis on ACT III, Mr. Lear hasn't withdrawn from politics, and though he hasn't yet endorsed any presidential candidate, his ability to raise money and marshal Hollywood's elite remains legendary. &quot;Norman exerts a tremendous moral influence in that community,&quot; says attorney and activist Mickey Kantor.    That influence is magnified because Democrats have found Hollywood among the few reliable sources of liberal financing. Mr. Kantor notes that in the past year nearly all the Democratic presidential hopefuls made the pilgrimage to Mr. Lear's house for dinner.    This sort of thing riles Mr. Lear's political enemies, who see him as representative of Beverly Hills liberalism in the entertainment industry. His critics are particularly galled at the participation of celebrities like Gregory Peck, who did a commercial accusing Judge Bork of defending poll taxes and literacy tests and opposing a key civil-rights law. &quot;It was McCarthyism in the extreme. They knew these things were false,&quot; asserts Bruce Fein, a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.    Mr. Lear, who adamantly denies any falsehoods, says that he draws political inspiration from his Russian immigrant grandfather, who was forever writing to Franklin D. Roosevelt. Norman sealed envelopes and ran errands for the 1936 Roosevelt campaign and reached college by winning a scholarship in an American Legion speaking contest on the Constitution. But World War II intervened, and Mr. Lear flew dozens of missions as a B-17 gunner in Europe. Back home, he decided to emulate a sporty uncle who was a New York publicity agent.    &quot;You made up 90% of the stuff,&quot; recalls Mr. Lear, who not only planted items but says that he wrote whole columns for columnists like Walter Winchell.    In 1958 he and director Bud Yorkin founded Tandem Productions. Mr. Lear wrote, Mr. Yorkin directed, and both produced, churning out programs and films starring Jack Benny, Henry Fonda and Frank Sinatra, among others. The business prospered, and three years ago Tandem and affiliates were sold to Coca-Cola Co. for $485 million.    The real source of Mr. Lear's wealth and reputation was television, and with &quot;All in the Family&quot; in 1971 he changed the course of the medium. Most of Mr. Lear's shows -- they include &quot;Maude,&quot; &quot;Sanford and Son,&quot; &quot;The Jeffersons,&quot; and &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot; -- have dealt with issues, but &quot;All in the Family&quot; startled viewers by tackling race relations, anti-Semitism, homosexuality, Vietnam, rape, abortion and women's rights when such subjects were prime-time taboos.    Mr. Lear has had some flops, though, and he doesn't always have the Midas touch in business. Ask how he came to be victimized in two multimillion-dollar tax-shelter schemes.    &quot;These things take place with people like me when an accountant comes to you six hours before your return has to be mailed,&quot; Mr. Lear says wryly, despite his potentially enormous tax liability. &quot;The accountant is unshaven and unkempt. He says, 'We're taking a position in a wonderful thing. You're gonna be in with three Walter Wristons.'&quot;    Almost 10 years ago, Mr. Lear backed away from most prime-time television. He had begun watching TV evangelists to prepare for a film, and he became alarmed about the politics of religion. Abandoning his movie plans, he tackled the TV ministers head-on with a series of commercials. One featured a construction worker who complained about an un-Christian cleric by saying, &quot;That's not the American way.&quot; Thus was People for the American Way born.    Mr. Lear says that because he is Jewish and is in the entertainment business, he lacked the &quot;credentials&quot; to proceed alone. So he rounded up like-minded clerics and others and provided $100,000 in initial financing. &quot;People&quot; says it stresses pluralism and free expression. In 1987 it spent $10 million, mostly raised in small donations, and it now has 270,000 members.    Mr. Lear acknowledges that his contempt for religious hucksterism goes way back. In 1970, he even became a minister by mail. &quot;I sent two $5 checks, one for myself and one for my dog,&quot; he says. &quot;We both became ministers on the same day.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
