Her &quot;An Angel at My Table&quot; -- all two hours and 38 minutes of it -- hasthe temerity to deal in ideas and character nuance as it chronicles thedesperate ordeal of Janet Frame, once ridiculed as &quot;New Zealand's madwriter.&quot;;    Based on three volumes of Frame's autobiography, &quot;Angel&quot; (openingtoday) begins in 1924, when Frame was born, and covers roughly 25 years inthis remarkable woman's development as artist and human being. Frame, whoseburst of orange hair will put you in mind of Little Orphan Annie, is played bythree equally talented actresses: Alexia Keogh for the cruel childhood scenes,Karen Fergusson for the more robust teen years, and Kerry Fox for the laterhospital stays and years abroad in England and Spain.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ANGEL HEARTAN EPIC THAT HOLLYWOODWOULDN'T HAVE TOUCHED:'AN ANGEL AT MY TABLE'CHRONICLES THE SUFFERINGOF A 'MAD WRITER'AND REMARKABLE WOMAN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  REVIEWMOVIES  </MEMO><TEXT>     According to this extraordinarily detailed and perceptive biography, Framewas an extremely shy and sensitive girl who, during college, had herselfcommitted to a mental hospital where she was misdiagnosed as schizophrenic.Over the next eight years, she was &quot;cured&quot; by 200 electroshock treatments.;   The young Frame is relieved when the doctors finally decide she is notschizophrenic. When, years later, a London doctor says she should never havebeen institutionalized, instead of anger, Frame experiences renewed dread.;   Suddenly, she has been deemed strong enough to meet the world on its ownterms.;    &quot;How could I now ask for help when there was nothing wrong withme?&quot; asks Frame, as disappointed as she is confused.;    In its treatment of ahandicapped outsider traumatized as much by well-meaning friends and relativesas society, &quot;Angel&quot; can take its place beside such brilliant case studies as&quot;The Miracle Worker&quot; and &quot;My Left Foot.&quot; In many respects, it's subtler andmore ambitious than these earlier works. As with her darker, wilder debutfeature, &quot;Sweetie,&quot; Campion never goes for the obvious or the sentimental tobuild empathy for a protagonist whose behavior doesn't match the norm. Theportrait that emerges is poignant, pathetic, tragic and valiant. Hence, weexit understanding and admiring Frame, not pitying her.;    Had Campion onlyconcentrated on Frame's personal ordeal -- taunts and injuries at the hands ofunfeeling classmates and teachers -- &quot;Angel&quot; would have listed into melodrama.This doesn't happen because (1) the actresses playing Frame are meek andunderstated to a fault, and (2) as much time is devoted to Frame's literarygrowth (early poems, first trip to the library, etc.) as her emotionalsetbacks. Here, finally, is a movie about a writer who, in contrast to thecharacters in &quot;Henry andamp; June,&quot; does more than pose at a writing table.;    Part1, based on &quot;To the Is-Land,&quot; is a sort of child's-eye view of alienation anddaily rebukes. Frame's twin, we're told, died at birth. Frame herself was aschoolyard outcast who stole from Mum's purse to buy friendship. This earlysection is a dead-on, heart-rending reminder of how teachers, confronted withthe &quot;backward&quot; student, can set the tone for a lifetime of insecurity andself-consciousness. Instead of receiving encouragement, Frame was singled outas a freak -- and sanctioned this image of herself even after literary successcame her way.;    Part 2, from &quot;An Angel at My Table,&quot; plays like a D.H.Lawrence novel, complete with sojourn with a dying uncle and secret,unreciprocated crush on a dashing teacher. It is here that Frame takes refugein a psychiatric ward when an anxiety attack makes it impossible for her tocontinue teaching, her initial goal.;    The final segment, befitting itssubtitle (&quot;The Envoy From Mirror City&quot;), has an almost lustrous, almost giddytone. It charts Frame's exploration of new geographic and psychologicalterrain. In London and the Spanish coastal town of Ibiza, she takes a crashcourse in being a more rounded, self-reliant person.;    Campion hasaccomplished something quite brave and wonderful -- a textured, oddlymatter-of-fact portrait that has nothing resembling a conventional Hollywoodepiphany. Fox as Frame -- rotten teeth, frayed smocks and all -- doesn'toutwardly change all that much. It's the viewer who grows as he spends timewith this severely introverted woman and begins to glimpse the beauty andcompassion behind the downcast eyes.;    &quot;An Angel at My Table&quot; ismovie-making of a very high caliber. It's easily the most moving experienceI've had in a theater in a long, long time.;  An Angel at My Table;(star)(star)(star)(star); Rating: R (for slight nudity, but should be PG-13);Cast: Kerry Fox, Iris Churn, Karen Fergusson; Director: Jane Campion; Writer:Laura Jones  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GLENN LOVELL, Mercury News Film Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910705  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  814  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday July 5, 199100187110,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
