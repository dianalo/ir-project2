Galtieri was due to appear in Rosario Federal Court Wednesday toanswer charges stemming from the December 1976 shooting deaths of13 political prisoners.   Eighteen other retired generals or admirals face similar chargesin trials that are resuming after a lapse of more than a year.Officers still are reluctant to testify. They have said theproceedings should be in military, not civilian court _ if held atall.   ``There is a situation of understandable uneasiness,'' DefenseMinister Horacio Jaunarena was quoted as saying in an Oct. 11interview in the newspaper La Nacion. ``(But) there is not theremotest possibility of a change in the (political) order.''   Low pay also has contributed to grumbling in the barracks,Jaunarena said. He said a general earns about $1,053 a month and aconscript is paid about $5 a month. The national minimum wage isabout $87 a month, he said.   Military salaries have not kept up with inflation, which hassoared 440 percent during the past 12 months. Also, the militaryshare of the federal budget has shrunk by half since President RaulAlfonsin took office in December 1983. It now stands at about 2percent.   Alfonsin replaced a military dictatorship that had ruled sincePresident Isabel Peron was ousted by a coup in 1976. The humanrights abuses occurred for the most part in the mid-1970s duringthe military's crackdown on leftists.   A government commission issued a report in 1985 that said almost9,000 people were arrested by security forces and never seen again.   In December 1985, five of the nine military officers who servedin ruling juntas between 1976 and 1983, including former presidentsGen. Jorge Videla and Gen. Roberto Viola, were convicted by federalcourt for crimes including kidnapping, torture and murder.   Galtieri, president from December 1981 through June 1982, wascommander of the 2nd Army Corps in Rosario on Dec. 13, 1976, whenthe political prisoners were slain.   Soldiers of the 2nd Army Corps said the 13 tried to escape whilebeing transferred from one jail to another. Witnesses said theywere deliberately killed.   Galtieri's attorneys initially asked the Supreme Court to cancelthe trial because only the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, themilitary's highest court, was legally empowered to try Galtieri.   The Supreme Court rejected that argument on Oct. 3.   On Monday, defense attorneys claimed Galtieri was tried andacquitted of the massacre during the 1985 trial. Prosecutorsrejected that claim. The Rosario Federal Court was expected to ruleshortly whether trial would go ahead as scheduled.   Rosario, Argentina's third largest city with 1 millionresidents, lies 185 miles northwest of the capital, Buenos Aires.   Galtieri currently is serving a 12-year sentence after he wasconvicted by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces in May 1986 ofmismanaging the 1982 war with Britain over the Falkland Islands.   A civilian court is reviewing that decision. Prosecutor LuisMoreno Ocampo has asked Buenos Aires Federal Court to increase thesentence to 18 years in prison.   Relations between the civilian government and the military, inpower for most of the years between the 1955 coup that oustedPresident Juan D. Peron and Alfonsin's election five years ago,have always been sensitive.   In April 1987, three garrisons revolted after Maj. ErnestoBarreiro refused to appear in court and face trial for allegedhuman rights violations.   A month later, Congress passed the ``Due Obedience'' law thatstated only generals could be charged with human rights abuses fromthat point on. Cases against hundreds of lower-ranking officerswere dropped, because they allegedly were only following orders.   Alfonsin, who proposed the legislation, said it was necessary toavert civil war.</TEXT></DOC>
