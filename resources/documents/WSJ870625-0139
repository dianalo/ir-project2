It is the world's longest, came the reply in many voices. But at St. Ansgar's School, that is only half the answer. The Nile, said the guest speaker who posed the question, is also a symbol for the black liberation struggle in South Africa. &quot;It is very long, with many twists and turns,&quot; he said.    Here at St. Ansgar's, in a cluster of rundown classrooms and dormitories just outside the huge black township of Soweto, even routine lessons become parables of life under apartheid. A &quot;people's school&quot; practicing &quot;people's education,&quot; St. Ansgar's reflects the frustration and anger of South Africa's blacks with a state educational system that they feel is a government instrument to maintain white domination.    &quot;People's education&quot; is more than just the three R's. An English lesson at St. Ansgar's (named for the abandoned Swedish Lutheran Mission it occupies) centers on the latest work of an emerging black poet. A history discussion looks at the beginnings of the black-consciousness movement. A leading member of the anti-apartheid front occasionally drops by to address a student assembly: It was Aubrey Mokoena, an official of the campaign to free Nelson Mandela, the jailed leader of the banned African National Congress, who spoke of the Nile.    At an ordinary state school, the black poet, black politics, Mr. Mandela and the ANC are all taboo. But St. Ansgar's is no ordinary school.    &quot;We are education for liberation,&quot; says Paul Jackson, St. Ansgar's portly principal. &quot;We try to impart not only knowledge but values that will encourage the students to appreciate who they are. We want to be seen as part and parcel of the struggle.&quot;    St. Ansgar's was founded 18 months ago, at the low point of the black education crisis, by a group of Soweto parents who wanted their children in school studying, not outside protesting. By shaping the curriculum themselves, rather than abiding by Department of Education guidelines, these parents seek to counteract the perceived racial bias and resulting tensions in the state-run schools. St. Ansgar's, in essence, is a grassroots prep school for a post-apartheid South Africa.    &quot;The state education system is just preparing black people to be laborers in society -- people like myself, common workers with no self-confidence,&quot; says Samuel Shelembe, a bank clerk whose eight-year-old daughter attends St. Ansgar's.    Mr. Shelembe reflects on his own &quot;Bantu education,&quot; and on his ill-educated teachers. &quot;This system needs to be changed,&quot; he says. &quot;What we need to do is produce employers, not employees. Leaders, not followers.&quot;    In South Africa, that is far easier said than done. Under the year-old state of emergency, the government has cracked down on alternative-education programs that it feels threaten state authority. The National Education Crisis Committee, which is trying to tailor township education to black needs, has basically been driven underground and many of its leaders detained.    St. Ansgar's, along with a couple of other church-based private schools, has somehow slipped through this net of repression. St. Ansgar's even has good relations with the Afrikaner-dominated local town council; even though it is located in an area designated for white housing, the councilors have delayed developing the site until the school can relocate.    Since the Soweto riots in 1976, which were touched off by a decree that students be taught in Afrikaans (it has since been rescinded; students now have a choice), schooling in the township has suffered constant interruption. In 1984, militant black students began terrorizing administrators and teachers, forcing many schools to close. By 1986, a school boycott spread across the country. In Soweto, no one went to school. A generation stopped learning.    &quot;The comrades {young militants} told us to stay away from school, or it would be burned down,&quot; remembers 12-year-old Rachel, who now attends St. Ansgar's. &quot;They chased our teacher, and then we were all chased by the Boers {the police}. Then they closed the school.&quot;    The Soweto Community Social Center, a parents' self-help organization, decided to create a low-cost boarding school that would be both outside the township and the state education system. On Feb. 4, 1986, St. Ansgar's opened.    &quot;We wanted to show the government that we can do something about our children's education,&quot; says Miriam Serongoane, one of the founding parents.    Under the state of emergency, an uneasy calm has settled over the townships and most of the Soweto schools have reopened. But the underlying problems and tensions remain -- as well as the need for a place like St. Ansgar's, the parents say.    Today there are 278 students at St. Ansgar's, ranging in age from three to 23, and 4,700 more waiting to get in. When a meeting was held to discuss establishing another people's school, interested parents filled two Soweto churches.    So valued are spots at St. Ansgar's that some parents sacrifice to come up with the 100 rand ($50) a month for tuition and board (other private schools charge as much as 5,000 rand a year). One father sold his car to meet his payments. Another signed over his unemployment check.    The school is equally impoverished, despite funding from U.S. and South African corporations. The classrooms need a good scrubbing, the wooden desks are in disrepair, there aren't enough books to go around. The dormitories are generally unheated, the hot water inadequate. Some younger children sleep two to a bed.    &quot;We may skimp on luxury,&quot; says Mr. Jackson, the principal, &quot;but we have different priorities.&quot;    One of these is its teaching staff. The 16 full-time teachers, blacks and whites, are more qualified than the average township teacher; at St. Ansgar's, they have college degrees or years of experience.    Another is the curriculum. St. Ansgar's exposes students to things they wouldn't normally encounter in a township school: a visit to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, nature field trips and science projects in conjunction with nearby universities, not to mention black history and culture.    &quot;In the Soweto schools, we were spoonfed. We were told it is like this or that,&quot; says Motsamai Koapeng, 15. &quot;Here, they make you think for yourself.&quot;    At St. Ansgar's, Motsamai is thinking of becoming an engineer. &quot;Until I came here I didn't really know what math was for. I didn't even know I was good in math,&quot; he says. &quot;But, you know, I really am.&quot;    But Mr. Jackson knows that the school's success will be judged by how students behave outside the classroom. On one recent weekend, some windows were broken and three calculators taken. On Monday, Mr. Jackson called an assembly.    &quot;You are the leaders of tomorrow,&quot; he said. &quot;Is this the way a liberated South Africa will act?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
