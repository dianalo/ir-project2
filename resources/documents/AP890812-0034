The jury ruled Friday that Curtis Beseda, serving 20 years in aTexas federal prison for setting fire to the Feminist Women'sHealth Center in Everett, violated the Racketeer Influenced CorruptOrganizations statute through arson and extortion directed at theclinic.   Beseda, Roberts, 53, and Sharon Codispoti conspired to violatethe statute, the jury also found.   Beseda, who told the jury earlier in the month-long trial thathe had no intention of setting any fire until he heard God tell himto do it, was ordered to pay $268,500 in civil damages. Beseda,Roberts and Codispoti will share another $11,000 fine, as well asthe clinic's legal expenses and court costs.   All damages can be trebled under the RICO statute. Theplaintiffs had sought $560,029.   Two other defendants, Bonnie and Michael Undseth of Snohomish,were acquitted.   ``I know that I didn't do anything wrong,'' said Codispoti, ofLake Stevens. ``At this point I'm taking my strength from that.   ``If I had to to it all over again, I'd still go out and picketthe abortion clinic.''   The lawsuit is only the second time the racketeering statute,established to fight organized crime, has been used againstabortion protesters.   Damages will go to several clinic employees and to the FeministWomen's Health Center of Yakima, parent clinic to the one thatburned.   ``I'm delighted,'' said William J. Bender, lawyer for theclinic, who said he found the decision ``fundamentally important.''   ``It should be a clear message to anyone'' who protests abortionclinics in the future, he said.   Lawyer Theresa Schrempp, representing Roberts, promised anappeal. She said she could not understand how there could be aconspiracy if jurors did not find her client had actually violatedthe racketeering act.   To win under the racketeering statute, one must show that anenterprise adversely affected interstate commerce and constituted apattern of illegal acts such as arson, extortion, wire fraud,robbery, kidnapping or murder, said Edmond Tiryak, the civil rightsattorney who tried a recent precedent-setting case in Philadelphia.   There, 26 individuals were found to have committed multiple actsof extortion at an abortion clinic. The clinic was awarded $100,000.   The Philadelphia case was upheld on appeal in March anddefendants have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear it.   The Everett clinic was burned three times between December 1983and April 1984, then closed its doors.   ``A conspiracy is so hard to prove,'' said Diane Hale, adirector of the former clinic. ``I think it's really wonderful thatwe were able to do it and the jury believed us. If we could do it,other people could do it, too. This is a way they can protectthemselves.''</TEXT></DOC>
