The Air Force is expected to award two contracts for development and preliminary designs in August, and later one of the two will be chosen to build the new system, known as the Advanced Launch System. An Air Force spokesman said the estimated cost of the overall program wasn't immediately available.    The system, which the Air Force said must significantly cut the cost of launching big payloads, will be used by the Air Force, Strategic Defense Initiative Organization and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Martin Marietta is based in Bethesda, Md., and McDonnell Douglas is based in St. Louis. </TEXT></DOC>
