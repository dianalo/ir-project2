Throughout thenight and into Friday, Mr. Kahan and his network ofvolunteers and staff members tracked down Jews in the NewYork area who would be available Sunday to call 100,000 morepeople and solicit money for Israel. Phone banks wereinstalled at four sites for the more than 1,000 volunteerswho showed up.   The pitch was direct and stunningly effective: &quot;Israel wasunder a tremendous onslaught,&quot; says Mr. Kahan, &quot;its economydevastated by the mobilization. Meanwhile, the Russian Jewswere pouring in. There was an urgent need.&quot; That day and thenext, the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of New York, thelargest chapter of the national United Jewish Appeal (UJA),raised more than $6 million.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;War helped focus people's attention. How could it notwhen you could see people wearing gas masks on CNN?&quot; says BenGolub, a partner in Blackstone Financial Management and a UJAcontributor and fund-raiser. &quot;First you had excitement overthe Russian immigrants, then anxiety about how long theSoviet gates would be open, and then you had the war.&quot;   While some Jews received phone calls for pledges, othersreceived a visit from Israel's finance minister, YitzchakModai, who flew here in the midst of war to visit, amongothers, the staffs of the investment firm of Bear Stearns andamp;Co. and the law firm of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher andamp; Flom.The finance minister talked about &quot;Operation Exodus,&quot; thetransport and resettlement of the thousands of Jews leavingRussia for Israel every week. At the same time, UJAfund-raisers were flying to Florida to pursue vacationing NewYorkers there; others were writing letters and calling orvisiting friends, clients, colleagues and congregants. TheUJA mailed tens of thousands of letters, advertised on theradio and bought full-page ads (&quot;If Not Now, When?&quot;) in localnewspapers.   &quot;Juices are flowing,&quot; says Mr. Kahan. &quot;Ordinarily, it's avery arduous business getting people to dispense money forabsolutely nothing in return. It's been easier since Jan.17.&quot;   The UJA also had spectacular results in two previous wars-- $175 million in the month following the Six Day War of1967, and more than $100 million in the first week after theYom Kippur War in 1973. But even between wars, thisorganization is &quot;probably the most successful moneymakingmachine in the history of philanthropy,&quot; according to CarlBakal, author of &quot;Charity USA.&quot; Last year, as tensions in theGulf region escalated, the national UJA and its sisterfederations collected $1.2 billion, more than the AmericanCancer Society, CARE and the March of Dimes combined. Ofthat, some $700 million will go to Israel, with most of therest going to domestic social services.   UJA runs a lean operation, and its fund-raising record isspotless. In 1989, it spent less than 6% of its total budgetraising funds and less than 1% on administration, accordingto Nonprofit Times of Hopewell, N.J. Donations aretax-deductible, and therefore can't be used for militarypurposes.   For many donors, there is always good reason to give moneyto Israel. &quot;A strong Israel is very important for theself-respect and position of Jewish Americans,&quot; says JonLeader, an investment manager and veteran UJA contributor.Scud attacks from Iraq just make giving now more imperative.Mr. Leader calls it the &quot;appreciation factor -- for Jews wholive in Israel and are willing to subject themselves to thatkind of danger.&quot;   In the New York area, home of more than two million Jews,many of Russian or Polish descent, the local chapter is alsoraising money for Operation Exodus. It is an emotional appealfor Jews who remember when Europe opened its doors for Jewsto flee -- but only briefly. &quot;Who knows how long the {Soviet}doors will stay open?&quot; asks Marvin Lender, chairman of thenational UJA.   The war adds the haunting image of Russian emigres gettingoff their planes and being handed gas masks. &quot;German gas toJews resonates,&quot; says Elaine K. Winik, a UJA volunteer. Soalthough the New York chapter was assigned by the nationalUJA to raise $75 million for Operation Exodus, New Yorkdecided to shoot for $100 million. As of last week, it hadraised about $90 million.   Operation Exodus uses the UJA's regular fund-raisingchannels -- including missions, or tours of Israel. Eventhrough missile attacks, American Jews have been flying toIsrael. Mrs. Winik recently returned from a mission duringwhich she was forced to seek refuge in sealed rooms with gasmasks. During one attack, she and her husband were sealedinto a hotel room with two Russian chambermaids, and the fourof them danced the hora with their gas masks on. &quot;It's a loteasier to sign a check than it is to be on the receiving endof Scud attacks,&quot; says Mrs. Winik.   Although there was initial concern in the Bushadministration that the Soviet Jews would be used to populatethe occupied territories, fewer than 1% have settled there sofar, the UJA says.   Last spring, Operation Exodus kicked off with theorganization's largest mission ever -- 850 Americans landedat Ben Gurion Airport just 20 minutes before a plane ofRussian emigres pulled up to a nearby gate. The Americanswere encouraged to pick up flowers and hand them to theRussians as they came off the ramp, says John Softness, headof Softness Group Inc., a New York public-relations company,who was on the mission. &quot;It was very emotional. And thatpretty much set the tone for the whole thing. The mission wasas thought-out a special event as I've seen, and I speakprofessionally.&quot;   Like all missions, this one had its amusements, such asthe time the bus took them to a battlefield on the GolanHeights, where a battalion of Israeli tanks was zippingaround, firing wildly at targets. &quot;There were all us NewYorkers in our plaid pants cheering on the sidelines andtaking pictures,&quot; says Mr. Softness. Then the tanks abruptlystopped and parked. Out of each jumped an attractive youngdriver, who joined the tourists for a chicken lunch and toldthem how happy they were to serve their country. A generalflew in on a helicopter.   &quot;It was as if the whole country had been taken into a roomand told, `Now we really want to impress these people,'&quot; saysanother mission traveler.   The missions are planned under the demanding eye of SaraYaron, who is said to study her charges so thoroughly thatshe knows if they prefer foam or feather pillows. &quot;Themajority of people on these buses could afford to buy thebus,&quot; Ms. Yaron says, &quot;so the missions are done with care.The itinerary is thought out carefully, with an escalation ofemotions as we go along.&quot; Mission travelers, who pay theirown way, rarely leave Israel without making a financialpledge to the UJA.   The missions are equally important in building thevolunteer network that reaches out to Jews in their officesand homes. The UJA has divisions for dozens of professionalgroups, from exterminators to Wall Street firms; in thefashion group, there is a UJA group for menswear and anotherfor formal wear. In Wall Street firms, a volunteer isassigned to the research department and another to themergers and acquisitions department.   At a division's annual dinner, each table is called uponby a host to make a public pledge. Among New York law firms,UJA pledges are seen as a barometer of how well the firmshave done that year. At smaller events, individuals' namesare read out from cards, starting with someone the hostbelieves -- or knows -- will announce a big gift. The idea isthat peer pressure provokes bigger gifts. But outside theroom, givers won't speak numbers, believing the gifts to be adeeply private affair.   Card-calling was invented by Joseph Willen, a 60-yearveteran of Jewish fund-raising. Mr. Willen told Mr. Bakal,author of &quot;Charity USA,&quot; that he got the idea for cardcalling from reading Thorstein Veblen, the politicaleconomist who coined the phrase conspicuous consumption. &quot;Itseemed strange to me,&quot; Mr. Willen said, &quot;that for a person toshow off his wealth by conspicuous spending -- by buying artcollections or fancy homes and cars for himself -- wasconsidered good form, whereas conspicuous giving wasconsidered bad form.&quot;   Synagogues also act as UJA fundraisers, and lately theyhave been asking for more. David Andelman, who attendsservices at Central Synagogue in Manhattan, says on YomKippur, late last September, the UJA made its regular annualappeal to congregants. &quot;But I was stunned when at the end ofthe appeal, up pops another individual saying, `This yearwe're going to have to ask you to be doubly generous,'&quot; Mr.Andelman says. &quot;They said after 30 years of waiting, Russia'sgates have finally opened. So you've bled yourself dry forYom Kippur, and now you have to bleed yourself a whiter shadeof white. But people just did it.&quot;   Even with the prospect of the war winding down, UJAleaders say they are pressing ahead with their aggressivecampaign. &quot;We'll continue the fund-raising pressure for aslong and as heavily as we can,&quot; says Mr. Kahan. &quot;At somepoint, concern will start to wane. But until then we'll bepushing as hard as we possibly can.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
