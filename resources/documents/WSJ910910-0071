Some of Mr. Thomas's opponents have warned that theyintend to make him answer very explicit questions about hispersonal and philosophical beliefs, in order to avoidrepeating the example of David Souter, &quot;the stealthcandidate.&quot; But if Mr. Thomas does refuse to answer explicitquestions, it will not be merely Mr. Souter's example he willbe following -- it will be that of the justice he has beennominated to replace, Thurgood Marshall.</LP><TEXT>   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) has said that the Senateis &quot;entitled to a direct, categorical answer&quot; on JudgeThomas's stance on abortion, and on Roe v. Wade. ThurgoodMarshall's example makes it plain, though, that Mr. Thomasmay refuse to give that categorical answer. During theMarshall hearings in 1967, the issue of the day was notabortion but crime, and the most controversial case wasMiranda v. Arizona.   Sen. John L. McClellan (D., Ark.) pressed Mr. Marshall toreveal his opinion of the case. Mr. Marshall refused,explaining that there were other cases pending on variationsand interpretations of Miranda and that, if confirmed to theSupreme Court, he would have to rule on those cases: &quot;Ondecisions that are certain to be re-examined in the court, itwould be improper for me to comment on them in advance. . . .From all the hearings I have read about, it has beenconsidered and recognized as improper for a nominee to ajudgeship to comment on a case he will have to pass on.&quot;   Sen. McClellan emphasized that he did not want comments ona future case, but on a past case, Miranda. But Mr. Marshallheld firm, stating that future cases would be related tointerpretations of Miranda, and that the issue of crime wasstill very controversial.   Sen. Sam Ervin (D., N.C.) attempted to get Mr. Marshall todiscuss the case law that preceded Miranda, in much the sameway that Sen. Joe Biden (D., Del.) attempted to persuadeJudge Souter to comment on the right of privacy at issue inthe abortion cases, by way of Griswold v. Connecticut. ButMr. Marshall would not even remark on the 14 words in theFifth Amendment concerning self-incrimination.   Sen. Ervin, exasperated, pointed out that since thejurisdiction of the Supreme Court is so broad that a case onpractically any issue might come before it, Mr. Marshall'stheory meant that the committee would have a difficult timeasking any questions about Mr. Marshall's judicialphilosophy. &quot;It is a problem,&quot; Mr. Marshall said, though aproblem for the committee, not the nominee. In the end, Mr.Marshall would comment only on such long-decided cases as theGibbons v. Ogden case of 1824, which concerned issues of suchvintage that they were no longer controversial.   Some of Mr. Thomas's detractors have openly worried thathe seems too distant from his origins in the segregatedSouth. Eleanor Holmes Norton, delegate to Congress from theDistrict of Columbia, said that she hoped he would &quot;bring tothe bench his personal experience as a poor black man.&quot;Harvard Law School's Derrick Bell fears that Mr. Thomas would&quot;look black but think white.&quot;   But such personal experiences are irrelevant to the workof a justice of the Supreme Court, according to ThurgoodMarshall. &quot;A judge is not permitted to use his own personalviews under any circumstances,&quot; he said, &quot;but if theparticular decision-maker, whether he be judge or justice ormagistrate, applies the Constitution to the facts and itcomes out that way, that is inevitable.&quot; Sometimes theoutcome of a case is incidentally related to a justice'sprivate views, but personal preferences can play no part inthe decision-making process. Such crusading zeal isinappropriate, despite the 1990 call of Sen. Paul Simon (D.,Ill.) for a nominee with &quot;fire in the belly.&quot; &quot;There isnothing personal allowed, nothing personal,&quot; Mr. Marshallemphasized. Justices &quot;shall not use their personal views, andindeed, they take an oath not to do so.&quot;   The intellectual leaders of the coalition that defeatedthe Bork nomination, notably Laurence Tribe in his 1987 book,&quot;God Bless This Honorable Court,&quot; insisted that the Senatehad the right -- and the responsibility -- to scrutinize anominee's general political or judicial philosophy. Thisissue was raised in the Marshall hearings too. Clearly asenator may vote any way he wishes on a nomination, and forany reason; but not all votes nor all reasons are consistentwith the duties of senators, and with the manner in whichthey ought to behave. This thought was expressed mosteloquently by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), whose primarycontribution to the Marshall hearings was elucidating thenormative guidelines for senators.   Sen. Kennedy stressed a central point both in thecommittee room and before the full Senate: The Senate is toassess qualifications; it is not to examine political orjudicial philosophy. &quot;We are not charged with theresponsibility of approving a man to be associate justice ofthe Supreme Court only if his views always coincide with ourown,&quot; Sen. Kennedy stated. &quot;We are not seeking a nominee forthe Supreme Court who will express the majority view of theSenate on every given issue, or on a given issue offundamental importance.&quot; It was Sen. Kennedy's view that onlythe professional background of a nominee was relevant forsenatorial consideration, not his substantive views.   The question of &quot;ideological balance&quot; on the court wasalso raised in this context, and addressed by Sen. RomanHruska (D., Neb.). Sen. Hruska had received letters statingthat Mr. Marshall was too liberal for the Supreme Court, thathe would upset the &quot;balance&quot; between liberals andconservatives. Sen. Hruska dismissed these fears asirrelevant. &quot;The nominating power lies with the president ofthe United States; and if it is his desire to appoint someonehe considers a liberal, that is his prerogative. If he wantsto nominate someone he considers a conservative, that is alsohis prerogative.&quot; The role of the Senate is to &quot;inquire intothe integrity, the competence and the record of a man,&quot; nothis ideology.   Several other issues were brought up during the Marshallhearings that have a bearing on Judge Thomas's case. Sen.Kennedy believed that because Mr. Marshall had been movedthrough the Judiciary Committee before, the Senate could&quot;move expeditiously ahead with his confirmation.&quot; Mr. Thomas,too, has been previously approved by the committee. Mr.Marshall had been accused of having communist ties, in partbecause in one case he cited a work by Herbert Aptheker, aleading U.S. communist theoretician. Committee Chairman JamesEastland (D., Miss.) raised this issue, but only to allow Mr.Marshall to clarify the facts, and to state that he was not acommunist. Mr. Thomas's supposed ties to Louis Farrakhan seementitled to equal treatment.   Finally, the fact that Mr. Marshall was black was treatedas noteworthy, but not determinative. In the case of JudgeThomas, blackness ought to be regarded the same way. The factthat Mr. Thomas's judicial views are not the same as those ofThurgood Marshall is a reflection of the increasinglypluralistic nature of black society, but hardly an issueworthy of senatorial consideration. As the second blackAmerican to serve on the Supreme Court, Judge Thomas willshoulder many responsibilities; not because he is black, butbecause he will hold a lofty office.   ---   Mr. Robbins is a historian in Ayer, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
