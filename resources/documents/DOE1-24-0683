It was found that the present system could beoperated stably by adding pure Ar in the gas mixture, and the outputpower was higher than that of the conventional CO{sub 2}-N{sub 2}-Hemixture. Futhermore, an optimum laser output was obtained by choosinga mixed ratio of He:Ar = 1:1. Experiments showed that the small signalgain of the laser medium tended to increase with an increase in the proportionof Ar gas. A simple rod electrode was used to produce a dc auxiliarydischarge. With it, a stable glow discharge was obtained at higher pressureand higher discharge input. This laser system is used to study the processingof electronic components and semiconductor devices. 11 references.</TEXT></DOC>
