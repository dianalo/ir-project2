Navy Capt. Rex Robles said reform-minded officers initiallyplanned to establish a transitional council to run the country untilnew elections could be held. Later, they threw their support to Mrs.Aquino.   In an interview with radio station DZRH, Robles said the Reformthe Armed Forces Movement planned to move against Marcos in December1985 but postponed their move after he called a ``snap'' electionfor the following February.   ``So we decided to postpone until sometime after elections,around April or May in the summer,'' Robles said. ``When there was abacklash (against) cheating in the elections, we accelerated it.''   Robles made the remarks on the third anniversary of a militarymutiny, when officers led by then-Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrileand then-Vice Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos announced theywere breaking with Marcos.   That triggered a massive popular uprising, during which hundredsof thousands of civilians poured into the streets to defend themutineers against Marcos' troops. Marcos fled Manila three dayslater for exile in Hawaii.   Enrile and Ramos declared their support for Mrs. Aquino. Both sheand Marcos claimed victory in the elections of Feb. 7, 1986, whichthe Roman Catholic hierachy and foreign observers said were markedby unprecedented fraud.   ``Our plan was if we succeeded in ousting Marcos or asking him tostep down, we would set up a transition council, either five toseven members,'' Robles said. ``Our agreement was whoever joined thetransition council would not run in the election which we would holdbecause it would be unfair.''   Robles did not explain why the officers dropped the transitionalcouncil in favor of Mrs. Aquino. The reform movement included formerLt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, sought in the violent August1987 attempt to topple Mrs. Aquino.   Movement members frequently have complained that they were nevergiven credit for their role in ousting Marcos.   In the interview, Robles said Marcos found out about the plot butwas uncertain when it was to be launched. Robles said theconspirators leaked a series of possible dates to confuse Marcos'supporters and force them into a series of security alerts.</TEXT></DOC>
