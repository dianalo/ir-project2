The value of the deal was not disclosed.   PCO Inc., a 175-employee company based in the Chatsworth area ofLos Angeles, specializes in devices that convert electronic signalsto light and vice versa.   Until now, fiber optics have been used mainly for long-distancetelephone lines. IBM's investment signals the company's idea thatthe speed permitted by fiber optics will be useful in the computerfield, spokesman Paul Bergevin said today.   Corning, based in Corning, N.Y., made an additional investment inPCO and will keep a 65 percent interest in the company. Theremaining 10 percent will be owned by PCO employees, founders andother individuals.   Instead of using wires, computer users are beginning to connectclusters of personal computers and workstations with high-capacityfiber-optic cables, said John Kessler, president of KesslerMarketing Intelligence in Newport, R.I.   ``That market grew about 100 percent between 1987 and 1988 andwill continue very heavy growth over the next five years,'' Kesslersaid.   A longer-range goal is to use fiber optics inside computers toconnect chips, and even to use light signals on chips, but PCO isprobably not well-equipped in that area, Kessler said.</TEXT></DOC>
