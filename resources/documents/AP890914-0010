Expansion is most evident in Peru, where about 20 U.S. ArmySpecial Forces members quietly arrived three months ago and areproviding paramilitary training to national police in their battleagainst a fearsome alliance of cocaine traffickers and Maoistguerrillas.   In Bolivia, where the fight is less dramatic but equallyentrenched, about a dozen Green Berets have been conducting trainingand support operations from low-profile jungle base camps for years.   The confidential White House directive giving the Americanmilitary more leeway in the drug war was crafted with Peru andBolivia in mind, according to officials in Washington.   In Colombia, home to the biggest cocaine cartels, U.S. officialsdeny any military intentions beyond those associated with thedelivery of hardware.   About 200 soldiers, including advisers, trainers and technicians,accompanied the recent arrival of two C-130 transport planes, A-37observation and attack jets, UH-1H Huey helicopters and otherequipment in an emergency U.S. aid package for Colombia'santi-narcotics offensive.   But U.S. Ambassador Thomas McNamara told reporters the U.S. crewswould get the gear working, give some instruction and then get out _most of them within a few hours or days.   Colombian President Virgilio Barco repeatedly has insisted hiscountry wants U.S. money and equipment, not troops.   Direct American military action would almost inevitably produce awave of anti-U.S. nationalism and would certainly embarrass theBarco government, which has pressed for the United States to get outof Central American conflicts.   Peru and Bolivia, much poorer countries, also oppose major U.S.troop involvement but have allowed some training and supportpersonnel to operate.   In Peru, about 20 bilingual Green Berets began instructinganti-narcotics police at a special base near the central jungle townof Satipo, officials from the U.S. Embassy in Lima told TheAssociated Press.   ``It's intensive training, almost one-on-one,'' said embassyspokesman Gene Bigler. ``They're taking small groups of 40 to 50policemen and training them five weeks at a time.   ``There's one whole section on entering and leaving helicoptersunder fire.''   He said the policemen also are taught map reading, battlefieldfirst aid, jungle patrols and night patrols.   ``It's the same kind of paramilitary training that DEA agents arenow getting before they arrive in Peru,'' Bigler said.   The training program is designed to last two years, withPeruvians then taking over the instruction.   Bigler said U.S. authorities hoped the trained Peruvian officerswould be assigned to a newly built, heavily fortified policegarrison at Santa Lucia.   Several former Green Berets on contract to the U.S. governmentfor anti-narcotics efforts in Peru designed the Santa Lucia base,which includes an airstrip big enough for C-130s, three helicopterpads and nine buildings ringed by barbed wire and mines.   It is the centerpiece in a new, militarized strategy in Peru,where most of the world's coca is cultivated. Much of it is grown injungle areas controlled by the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrillaorganization.   ``Santa Lucia is probably better fortified than most militarybases in Peru,'' said Craig Chretien, the Drug EnforcementAdministration chief in Peru.   Pistol-packing DEA agents have been seen routinely accompanyingBolivian, Colombian and Peruvian police in raids on cocaineprocessing laboratories and traffickers' jungle hideouts. About sixU.S. Border Patrol agents assist in interdiction efforts. They areall under strict orders to avoid armed clashes.   DEA agents are among the U.S. military's harshest critics.   Speaking privately, they contend that U.S. soldiers lackpolitical sensitivity. They fear an increased American military rolewould bruise Latin egos and ruin relations with local authoritiesand sources.   ``If the Special Forces come down here on raids, I am pulling outof here. They are going to come down here thinking this is a warzone and start shooting at farmers, when what you need here isanother kind of presence,'' said one DEA agent in Bolivia.   When Green Berets accompanied Bolivian police on a raid in April,a U.S. soldier walked off with a confiscated shortwave radio,insulting a police commander who told him the radio had to beproperly registered, sources said. DEA agents had to intervene inthe dispute.   Nonetheless, about a dozen Green Berets have worked with theBolivian police force's elite anti-narcotics division, called theLeopards, for more than two years. It is widely acknowledged thatdisclipine among the Leopards has improved.   The U.S. Embassy in La Paz, the Bolivian capital, said it isready to extend the instruction program.   ``U.S. troops will not seek out conflict or combat, but we areprepared to expand our training role,'' embassy spokesman BruceWharton said.   The biggest U.S. military splash in the drug battle was made inJuly 1986, when 175 U.S. soldiers descended on Bolivia and helpedthe Leopards raid laboratories in the country's tropical lowlands.   The three-month operation drove traffickers underground andparalyzed cocaine processing operations in Bolivia, the source of upto 30 percent of the world's cocaine.   But officials reported no noticeable effect on the flow of thepotent white powder from South America to the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
