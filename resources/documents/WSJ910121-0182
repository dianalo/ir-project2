If the Transportation Department approves Northwest'srequest, it would strengthen the U.S. airline's cash positionand borrowing power at a time when the assets of severalcarriers, including Eastern Airlines, are coming up forgrabs.</LP><TEXT>   The $250 million was part of a $400 million equityinvestment that KLM made in August 1989, when an investorgroup led by Alfred A. Checchi acquired Northwest's parent,NWA Inc. Soon afterward, Transportation Secretary SamuelSkinner ordered NWA to reduce KLM's investment, citingconcerns about a foreign carrier exercising a &quot;controllinginterest&quot; in a U.S. airline.   &quot;Since 1989, it has become apparent KLM has not exertedsuch control,&quot; Northwest said.   Mr. Skinner may look favorably on Northwest's request,since, in the past, he has allowed NWA to keep postponing thedeadline for redeeming KLM's shares, which represent a 20%stake in NWA. The secretary also might want to avoid placingan additional financial burden on Northwest at a time whenall airlines are suffering from a sharp increase in fuelprices and downturn in passenger traffic.   A Transportation Department spokesman said he wasn'tfamiliar with the proposal, but said the department wouldreview any such request.   Mr. Checchi, NWA's chairman, has made no secret of hisdesire to expand Northwest through asset purchases. Severalmonths ago, he hatched a failed plan to acquire aircraft andairport gates from Eastern. He may try again to acquire thoseassets now that Eastern has shut down following two years inChapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.   Mr. Checchi is also said to be interested in acquiringeither one of the shuttles which operate between New York,Washington and Boston. He recently indicated an interest inbidding for Pan Am Corp., which filed for Chapter 11protection Jan. 9, should a bankruptcy court judge open thecarrier to offers, persons familiar with the situation said.Northwest declined comment on Mr. Checchi's plans.   NWA already has a pool of cash from which to bid for otherairlines' assets. Last September, Northwest received a $500million low-interest loan from Airbus Industrie and GeneralElectric Co. that was tied to orders it placed with theEuropean jet manufacturer and U.S. engine maker.   It is unclear, however, how much of the Airbus-GE loanremains, since Northwest used some of the cash to pay downthe approximately $1.5 billion in debt that remained in lastyear's third quarter from the Checchi group's $3.65 billionacquisition of NWA.   NWA also has access to several bank credit lines and Mr.Checchi is said to be able to tap into other sources of cashthrough his personal contacts in the investment community.Northwest recently was able to finance the $20 millionpurchase of five Pacific routes and a 20% stake in HAL Inc.,parent of Hawaiian Airlines.   Some aspects of Northwest's request to the TransportationDepartment may raise some hackles. For instance, the carrieralso is asking the department for permission to allow KLM toincrease the number of its voting common shares to 10.5% from4.9%. KLM's overall stake of 20% will remain unchanged.Federal law prohibits foreign carriers from owning more than25% of a U.S. airline for national security reasons.   Northwest also wants to expand its board to 15 membersfrom 12 so that two more KLM representatives can be added.KLM currently has one director on the board.   In addition to the common shares it holds, KLM also owns$57.5 million in nonvoting preferred shares.</TEXT></DOC>
