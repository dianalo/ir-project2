<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-16-0425 </DOCNO><TEXT>District radioactivity surveys made in 1955-7 around the Windscale Pileswere interpreted then as indicating a total release of 400g of irradiateduranium. It is now believed that only recently deposited particles weredetected, significantly underestimating the magnitude of the release.Later milk and soil samples in 1957-1961 indicated the release was inthe region of some tens of kilograms. Based on these data the NRPB deduceddoses and risks to children born and living around Sellafield, and someof these results are included. This report is published on behalf ofDr. Jakeman by the UKAEA.</TEXT></DOC>
