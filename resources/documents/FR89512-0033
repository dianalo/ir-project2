Implementing regulations governing the ocean salmon and Pacificcoast groundfish domestic fisheries are codified at 50 CFR Parts 661 and663, respectively. This rulemaking changes the Federal ocean salmon and groundfish regulationsto clarify landing restrictions in these fisheries, to provide consistencybetween regional fisheries regulations, and to facilitate enforcement.Following discussions at its March and April 1988 meetings, the Councilrecommended this rule to the Secretary. The rule contains two changes to the groundfish regulations and one changeto the ocean salmon regulations which are described below. (1) The rule clarifies the definition of ``land or landing'' in the groundfishregulations so that a vessel operator arriving in port prior to the endof a fishing period, if he had already landed the legal maximum for thatperiod, would not be in violation of trip limits unless he began to offloadfish again before the next legal period. (2) The rule also revises the definition of ``land or landing'' in theocean salmon regulations to be consistent with the groundfish regulations.(3) The rule modifies the definition of ``fishing trip'' in the groundfishregulations by eliminating the reference to leaving port, thus clarifyingthat trip limits apply to a fisherman who delivers to processing vesselsat sea, whether or not the fisherman returns to port between deliveries.This rule was proposed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on October 20, 1988 (53 FR 41214), and publiccomments were requested until November 18, 1988. No comments were received.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>NOAA issues this rule under authority of section 305(g) of the MagnusonAct to clarify certain provisions of the trip limit restrictions for Pacificcoast groundfish and to provide consistency between the Pacific coast groundfishand ocean salmon regulations. This action is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare anenvironmental assessment by NOAA Directive 02-10. This is because thisaction proposes only minor technical changes to the existing implementingregulations and does not result in a significant effect on the human environment.This action is not expected to alter the nature or intensity of environmentalimpacts which were addressed in: (1) The environmental impact statementfor the Ocean Salmon FMP (and in environmental assessments prepared forsubsequent FMP amendments), or (2) the supplemental environmental impactstatement (SEIS) prepared by the Council for the Pacific Coast GroundfishFMP and the environmental assessments for the three amendments to the FMP.The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere determined that this ruleis not a ``major rule'' requiring a regulatory impact analysis under ExecutiveOrder 12291. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the SmallBusiness Administration that this rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.This rule does not contain a collection of information requirement forpurposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Council determined that this rule does not directly affect the coastalzone of any state with an approved coastal zone management program. TheAssistant Administrator for Fisheries concurs with this determination.This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Parts 661 and 663 </ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801<T3> et seq</T3>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
