If Bush had found otherwise, the administration would have beenbarred from selling certain military products to the Saudis.   In a formal presidential certification, Bush said the Saudishave bought intermediate-range missiles from China but ``there isno credible intelligence reporting indicating that Saudi Arabiapossesses nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.''   Moreover, he said ``we are not aware'' of production facilitiesfor chemical or biological agents or weapons. He said the Saudispossess ``no significant nuclear facilities.''   A law enacted by Congress requires the president to make acertification about the Saudis' arsenal in order to continuemilitary sales.   Bush said that both the Saudis and Chinese have informed theUnited States the missiles purchased from Beijing will not beequipped with nuclear warheads.   The Saudis also have pledged the missiles will not be armed withchemical warheads, Bush said.   ``We remain concerned about the possible proliferation of thesetypes of weapons in the Middle East and will continue to watchdevelopments closely,'' Bush said. He promised to notify Congressof any change in developments in Saudi Arabia.</TEXT></DOC>
