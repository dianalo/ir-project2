Garcia</HL><DD> 07/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices rallied in moderate pre-holiday trading, following a higher bond market and a firmer dollar.    In keeping with tradition, the stock market broke out of its bearish mood of the past two days, and prices advanced before the long Fourth of July weekend. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 18 points in the first few minutes of trading, boosted by an influx of buy orders from foreign investors, traders said.    The flurry of buying interest faded after the first hour, but the industrial average held on to its early gains. Trading perked up in late afternoon and the blue-chip average extended its gains to finish up 26.94 at 2436.70.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.69 to 305.63, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index moved up 1.31 to 171.83.    On the Big Board, gainers outnumbered losers by a 9-to-5 count. Despite the price advance, volume again contracted, to 154.9 million shares from 157 million shares Wednesday.    The advance by stocks was matched by gains in the stock-index futures market. The September contract on the Sandamp;P 500-stock index, traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, rose 2.15 to 306.95.    Domestic institutional investors again weren't big participants in the stock market, after spending the week mostly on the sidelines, traders said.    Some traders and analysts said yesterday's advance was a rebound, following Wednesday's modest decline and the 28-point drop Tuesday in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    In addition, traders said that some short-term oriented accounts, such as hedge funds, covered short positions. They bought back shares to replace borrowed shares they had sold previously in anticipation of continued lower prices.    The June employment report set off the rally in the bond and foreign exchange markets, which stocks followed. Civilian unemployment fell to 6.1% last month from 6.3% in May, its lowest point since December 1979.    Despite the overall decline, the report indicated that non-farm employment has slowed, but mostly in the service sector. Economists, however, noted that growth in manufacturing jobs and other goods-producing employment are still rising. Growth in these last two sectors bodes well for improvement in exports.    The employment report and other recent economic data suggest that economic growth in the second quarter was moderate at best, if not sluggish. Many stock investors are pleased with that growth scenario, because booming growth portends higher credit demand and higher interest rates.    Robert Prechter, a technical analyst, believes the peak in the stock market's recent advance has yet to be seen. He expects the Dow Jones Industrial Average to move higher in the next few weeks, surpassing its record of 2451.05, set June 25.    This view is markedly different from last year's. The widely followed investment letter writer advised short-term oriented clients to take profits, which contributed to the stock market's slide after last year's Fourth of July.    A new stock, E-II Holdings, was the most active issue on the Big Board. E-II closed at 15, up 1/4 from its opening price of 14 3/4 but unchanged from its original offering price. More than 4.2 million shares were traded.    Investor reaction to the stock wasn't overwhelming; the 28 million-share offering of E-II was reduced from the 36 million shares originally planned. The price for the shares came at the lower end of the expected $15 to $18 range.    E-II, to be headed by former Esmark Chairman Donald P. Kelly, is an offshoot of closely held Beatrice. The new company, which contains Beatrice's non-food businesses, such as Samsonite luggage and Stiffel lamps, and some smaller specialty-food lines, will be used primarily as a vehicle for acquisitions.    Metromail rose 9 1/2 to 29 1/2 on trading of more than 1.9 million shares in the over-the-counter market. R.R. Donnelley andamp; Sons agreed to acquire Metromail for $282.6 million. R.R. Donnelley eased 1/8 to 38 1/2.    Union Carbide moved up 1 7/8 to 30 1/2 on more than 2.9 million shares. The stock rallied on reports that it was going to provide the name of the alleged saboteur in the Bhopal, India, gas leak disaster.    Traders said some investors bought the stock on the assumption that if Union Carbide could prove a criminal action had taken place at its Bhopal chemical plant, the company might be relieved of some of the heavy liability claims it currently faces.    The company said it held a news briefing in Bombay Wednesday for the Indian media, outlining the evidence it had developed to prove that the Bhopal tragedy had been caused by employee sabotage. The company said it has the name of the alleged saboteur, but said it won't reveal the name until the appropriate time in court. The information Union Carbide shared with the Indian media was previouly disclosed.    Culbro gained 3 1/8 to 45. Borden agreed to buy Culbro's Snacktime unit for $55 million.    Xyvision sank 3 1/4 to 12 3/4 as 876,000 shares were traded. The company expects net income for its first quarter ended last Tuesday to be significantly lower than a year earlier, despite a 40% to 50% increase in revenue. The company blamed the decline on delays of certain orders.    Home Shopping Network rose 1/8 to 18 5/8 on the American Stock Exchange. In the over-the-counter market, C.O.M.B. added 1 5/8 to 21 3/8, while QVC Network was unchanged at 10. An article in yesterday's Wall Street Journal reported that analysts are renewing their love affair with video-retailing companies.    But this time around, they favor the industry for its long-term prospect as a useful form of retailing and less for its speculative, wave-of-the-future reputation.    Koppers gained 1 5/8 to 42 1/4 on 318,500 shares. The stock was added to the Sandamp;P 500 index. Usually, when stocks are added to the index, money managers who pattern their portfolios on the index buy the stock.    View-Master Ideal Group moved up 1/2 to 11 3/4 in OTC trading. The company's board authorized the buyback of as much as $3.5 million of common stock from time to time in the open market.    Unitrode fell 1 1/4 to 11 1/2. The company said Wednesday that it expects a &quot;significant operating loss&quot; for its second quarter ending Aug. 1. Unitrode said that its loss is the result of an audit by a Pentagon agency, which discovered deficiencies in its documentation procedures, and it won't be able to ship certain products until the procedures have been corrected. </TEXT></DOC>
