These investors, derisively known as &quot;flippers,&quot; buy shares of an IPO and then unload them immediately after the stock begins public trading. The idea is to reap higher prices from other investors who weren't able to get in on the initial offering.    Although the IPO market is just beginning to show signs of renewed vigor, Richard L. Franyo, managing director at Alex. Brown andamp; Sons in Baltimore, declares that &quot;flippers are already here in spades.&quot;    Securities companies that underwrite IPOs don't like flippers because of the trading havoc they create. The underwriters strive to maintain calm trading in the new issues they bring to market. They don't like to see a new stock fall below its offering price. But flippers can sometimes exert enough pressure to topple the stock and, in the process, unnerve other investors who had planned to hold onto their shares.    &quot;The more activity there is in the IPO market, the more people tend to think they can make money over the short term,&quot; says Michael A. Pitt, partner at the Chicago underwriting company, William Blair andamp; Co. &quot;It turns heads and brings in people who aren't interested in {long term} investing; but there's very little you can do about it.&quot;    One reason so many deals fall prey to flippers, underwriters say, is that it's increasingly difficult to figure out which investors are buying for the long term and which plan to sell during the first minutes of trading. &quot;We try to do detective work,&quot; says Mr. Pitt. But in the end, he says, it's a judgment call.    Adds Mr. Franyo: &quot;Our job is to figure out who only wants to buy and sell the stock, and who really wants to own it. But it's very fluid. A guy who's buying to own one week can be a flipper the next time.&quot;    Underwriters have had only limited success at thwarting flippers. But one tactic that did keep flippers at bay was employed by Paulson Investment Co., a Portland, Ore., company that managed the $3.5 million IPO for Benton Oil andamp; Gas in March.    The company didn't allow trading in the shares of the Ventura, Calif., oil and natural gas exploration concern for seven days after the shares were sold to the public. Subscribers were prohibited from trading until after they received physical delivery of the shares and paid for them. The tactic allows an underwriter to closely track the movement of shares and penalize brokers who sell stock to flippers.    Thomas McChesney, senior vice president at Paulson Investment, is convinced that the Benton IPO was flipper-free. When flippers are active in a stock, the volume can surge to 40% or more of the newly issued shares. He estimates that only about 20% of the new shares changed hands during the first two days of public trading. Furthermore, the stock's price rose during that period. On Friday, Benton closed unchanged at 7, up from 5 in the offering.    It also helps to have friends in the brokerage business. Benton officials say eight brokers sold more than 90% of the new shares, according to John T. Moore, the company's executive vice president. Benton's corporate officers &quot;have known those brokers for years,&quot; says Mr. Moore. &quot;They put the shares in the hands of people who wouldn't look at the stock quote {with an eye to selling their shares} for several years.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity    The Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.49 to 457.42 on volume of 133.7 million shares. The index, which surpassed its previous record Thursday, was up 1% for the week.    Many technology stocks continued to rebound. Apple Computer jumped 1 1/2 to 42 3/4, Intel added 3/4 to 31 3/4, Sun Microsystems gained 3/8 to 14 3/4 and Microsoft chalked up 2 to close at 57.    However, as those computer-related stocks advanced, one of the index's largest stocks, MCI Communications, fell 1 3/8 to 37 1/8.    Jefferson Smurfit Corp. surged 22%, or 6 7/8, to 37 7/8 on 985,000 shares. Jefferson Smurfit Group, which owns about 78% of the paper and packaging products producer, said it is considering a proposal to acquire, together with Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II L.P., the remaining shares it doesn't own for $38 a share.    Jefferson Smurfit Group called the transaction part of a larger plan under which it is considering selling a large part of its overall U.S. interests to a new company it would own jointly with a Morgan Stanley affiliate. Jefferson Smurfit said it would own 50% of the common equity of the new entity, and would also receive in excess of $1 billion in cash for the sale of its U.S. interests.    A new issue, Serv-Tech, soared 25%, or 3 1/4, from its initial offering price in its first trading session. Shares of the provider of specialized maintenance services to the chemical industries closed at 16 1/4. The company offered 1.2 million common shares. </TEXT></DOC>
