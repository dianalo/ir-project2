Paramount, which indicated in making its initial $175-a-shareoffer for Time earlier this month that it was open to raising theoffer, said it had sweetened its cash bid to $200 a share.   In a letter to Time Chairman and Chief Executive J. RichardMunro, Paramount's chairman and chief executive Martin S. Davisrenewed his request for a meeting to ``address any concerns youmight have and to negotiate all aspects of our proposal.''   Time, which rejected Paramount's earlier $10.7 billion takeoverbid, issued a statement saying the Time board ``will considerParamount's increased tender offer in due course.''   ``Time Inc. advises its shareholders not to act on the offeruntil they hear from Time,'' the statement read.   But securities analysts said the new offer increases the pressureon Time to devise something that can provide its shareholders withvalue that comes close to matching Paramount's all-cash offer.   Time has launched its own $14 billion bid for Warner.   Paramount made its announcement shortly after the stock marketclosed, but Time stock already had rocketed higher on speculationabout the possibility that Paramount would raise its bid.   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Time rose $10.50 ashare to $165.87{. Paramount was down 50 cents a share at $58 andWarner was off 50 cents a share to $58.62{.   The sweetened offer for Time follows a week in which Paramountand Time swapped increasingly bitter charges in state and federalcourts in an effort to stop each other's takeover bids.   Many analysts are looking to a scheduled July 11 hearing inDelaware Chancery Court as a potentially pivotal date in the fightfor Time. Paramount said it intends to extend its offer until theDelaware court rules on its motion to block Time's buyout of Warner.   Time rejected Paramount's previous bid a week ago as inadequateand highly conditional. At the same time, it revised its earlierplan to merge with Warner in a stock swap and instead launched a$70-a-share bid for Warner.   The move has angered some Time shareholders who would have beenallowed to vote on the planned stock swap merger with Warner but arenot being asked to vote on the Time buyout of the record, film andcable concern.   Time argues that a combination with Warner _ which would createthe world's biggest communications concern _ eventually would beworth much more than the up-front cash payment Paramount is offering.   In his letter to Munro, Davis said he hoped the Time board andmanagement ``will now discontinue your efforts to precludestockholder choice and give Time's shareholders an opportunity toconsider our offer.''   J. Kendrick Noble, a media analyst for the securities firmPaineWebber, said the new offer for Time ``does put the pressure onTime.''   He said the company could still conclude the Paramount bid wasinadequate, but may have to work up a new plan in connection withthe Warner buyout to give disgruntled shareholders somethingmatching the price Paramount is offering.   ``It's possible they can work out something else,'' Noble said,but added it was ``tough to assess the outcome.''   Paramount said its offer remained subject to several conditions,including the obtaining of financing, termination of the Warneroffer and rescinding a stock swap in which Time and Warner gaveadditional new shares to each other.   Paramount estimated it will need $15.6 billion in financing forthe new offer, including $12.2 billion simply to buy the stock.   It said Citibank had agreed to provide $1 billion in financingand was highly confident it could arrange a syndicate of banklenders to provide an additional $13 billion.   Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. has said it could arrange the placement ofan addtional $1.6 billion in subordinated securities, Paramount said.   ``Despite all the rhetoric, all the talk of `war' and `rockets,'we continue to believe that if we work together we can structure atransaction that will be in the best interests of both of ourcompanies and their stockholders,'' Davis wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
