With the screams of his children fillingthe cabin, the plane plunged 15,000 feet before Mr. Wojnowichmanaged to pull up safely.   One day later, Donald Schreiber and his family weren't solucky. Racing a storm front as he flew north from a Floridavacation, Dr. Schreiber developed problems handling hisMalibu. The control tower at Jacksonville received a chillingfinal communication: &quot;We're having a . . .&quot; Moments later,the plane came down in pieces. All four occupants werekilled.                                                                                                          What happened in both incidents is part of a mystery thathas baffled federal safety investigators. In the past 2 1/2years, seven Piper Malibus have broken apart in flight inthree countries, killing 19 people, and several more have hadclose calls. A few days after the two March incidents, theFederal Aviation Administration slapped restrictions on theoperation of the more than 400 U.S. Piper Malibus, about 80%of the world-wide fleet.   The safety issue is especially incendiary among Malibuowners, who mostly are well-heeled entrepreneurs,professionals and corporate executives. They offer rapturousdescriptions of the racy single-engine propeller plane, whichhas a pressurized, six-passenger cabin that lets it cruise upwith jetliners at nearly 260 miles an hour. But the string ofcrashes is exacting a heavy toll.   Of primary concern, of course, is the loss of life. Inthis country, the other pilots killed have been Frank Adams,president of Morrison Knudsen Corp.; California executiveJames Hager; and Michigan businessmen John Wilson and EdwardVander Velden.   Owners and dealers also are taking a substantial financialhit. The resale value of the $400,000 plane has dropped by asmuch as $100,000. In some cases, insurance rates on Malibushave tripled.   The controversy even helped push Piper Aircraft Corp., thevenerable company whose name once was synonymous withsmall-plane flying, into Chapter 11 federal bankruptcyproceedings. Piper, like the rest of the light-aircraftindustry, has been devastated by product-liability insuranceproblems, and says that the dark cloud hanging over theMalibu frightened off potential financial backers.   Piper, based in Vero Beach, Fla., contends that the planeisn't at fault. It blames poorly trained pilots, and manyMalibu users agree with that assessment.   The Piper Malibu &quot;has a tendency to attract people withmore dollars than sense,&quot; says Rick Vorhees, who runs a Piperrental center in Van Nuys, Calif. He thinks of it as a &quot;hot&quot;plane that may be beyond the abilities of pilots accustomedto tamer small aircraft.   But others doubt that pilots are to blame. Of the 500 orso fatal light-plane crashes each year in the U.S., barely ahandful involve that most terrifying of scenarios: thebreaking apart of an airplane in flight. With hundreds oftypes of private planes flying, seven Malibu breakups in ashort span set the Piper model apart.   &quot;In-flight airframe failures should be extremely rare,&quot;says Brent Silver, a Sunnyvale, Calif., air-safetyconsultant. &quot;Like, zero is a really nice number.&quot;   Some Malibu owners point an accusing finger at theBendix/King KFC-150 automatic pilot, an electronic devicewith mechanical connections to the plane's wings and tail.They call it notoriously quirky, and capable of causingspecial challenges in the Malibu -- a plane speedy enough tobe potentially unforgiving of mistakes in the all-weatherflying for which it is designed. A spokesman forAllied-Signal Co.'s Bendix/King unit says that in thecompany's view, tests so far in the investigation have&quot;confirmed that our system is safe and there are no designdefects.&quot;   A special investigation into the Malibu by the NationalTransportation Safety Board has centered on a tragiccombination of elements, including an autopilot system thatmay be prone to glitches, even if it appears free of majordesign defects. But officials of both the safety board andthe FAA, who expect to issue reports before the end of theyear, still haven't been able to pinpoint a cause -- 30months after the first breakup.   While that first one occurred in May 1989 in Bristol,Ind., federal investigators didn't become suspicious untilmore than a year later, after crashes within a month's timeat Naylor, Mo., and Lakeville, Mich.   In the Naylor crash, Frank Adams, the Morrison Knudsonpresident, was flying home to Boise when he went into aseries of steep descents from 22,700 feet, leavingair-traffic controllers with just another abortedexplanation: &quot;I've lost my . . .&quot; In the June 1990 accidentin Michigan, pilot Wilson had climbed to 15,000 feet on asolo flight to Akron, Ohio, when his Malibu suddenly plungedstraight down and lost its horizontal stabilizers and wings.   The two crashes reminded investigators of an accidentinvolving Mr. Hager, a California executive whose Malibuplummeted and broke apart in clear skies over Bakersfield,Calif., killing him and a passenger. A further search throughaccident records then led to the Bristol crash, which atfirst had been blamed simply on the pilot's flying into athunderstorm.   Unlike major airliner disasters, accidents involving lightplanes generally don't attract wide attention. Investigatorsstudy 10 or so each week, and most are eventually blamed onsome sort of pilot error.   But the pattern suggested by these breakups set off alarmbells, prompting the safety board to assign investigator JeffRich to head a special task force to look into it. &quot;It wouldbe a horrible thing to let another person die,&quot; Mr. Rich tolda reporter in August 1990, shortly after being named. A fewweeks later, another Malibu -- the fifth -- broke apart nearHermosillo, Mexico, killing four people.   More than ever, Mr. Rich felt driven to find an answerquickly. His team methodically pieced together an &quot;in-flightsignature&quot; left by the crashes, searching for the so-calledgolden nugget that would explain the accidents.   Did turbulence rip the planes apart? The weather in thesecases didn't seem nearly severe enough to do that. Flighttests by the safety board and by Piper ruled out anotherobvious possibility, a structural flaw in the airframe. TheMalibu endured nearly eight times the pull of gravity inflight without damage. No plane is immune to the laws ofphysics, and radical maneuvers can cause any airframe tofail, but FAA certification rules provide an ample margin ofsafety for aircraft in a normal operating environment.   The autopilot, which investigators say had been activatedbefore all the accidents, became a prime suspect. Did it foulup? If so, investigators figured, it could have caused someof the &quot;excursions&quot; -- abnormal up and down movements -- thatshowed up on radar patterns before the breakups.   Could icing, turbulence or -- even more exotic --interference by radio transmissions from ground antennas haveskewed autopilot readings, resulting in false information ata time when a small pilot error could mean disaster?   As the investigation dragged toward the end of last year,Mr. Rich became increasingly haunted by a frighteningpossibility. &quot;The nightmare,&quot; he said in October, &quot;is youcan't come up with anything that says absolutely, this wasthe cause.&quot; In November, the nightmare intensified with thesixth Malibu crash, in Tottori, Japan, which claimed threelives.   &quot;It's not easy to sit back and work on a puzzle and worrythat another accident will happen,&quot; he says now. &quot;It'sdifficult to live with.&quot;   But answers didn't come easily. The autopilots in thecrashes were smashed, and tests on other Bendix/King devicesdidn't indicate a problem. Moreover, the autopilot, andindeed the whole aircraft, successfully weathered reviews oftheir certification standards. Still, the NTSB was startledto receive more than 350 complaints about the autopilot fromoperators of Malibus and other planes using that model. &quot;Wehave this body of circumstantial evidence that says somethingstrange is going on,&quot; Mr. Rich says. But with an autopilot,as with other electronic equipment, a malfunction wouldn'tnecessarily show up in a crash investigation. &quot;It doesn'tleave a trail or a footprint,&quot; he says.   Then came the Schreiber crash in March. It shook theair-safety system as few light-plane accidents have. Wipedout was an entire family -- a prominent Boston dentist; hiswife, who was running for the school board in suburbanBrookline; and two sons, 15 and four years old. Their deathscaused an uproar in Boston and brought federal aviationofficials under fire for not taking aggressive action on theMalibu.   A few days later, the FAA, having briefly consideredgrounding the plane, instead issued an &quot;emergencyairworthiness directive.&quot; The order prohibited all Malibuflying in any weather that obscures visibility and barred useof the autopilot.   The tough rules sharply reduced the planes' usefulness,sent sales skidding, and galvanized pilot groups and Piper topress for repeal. On April 19, the FAA backtracked, liftingmany of the toughest restrictions but retaining prohibitionson flight into &quot;known or forecasted&quot; ice, thunderstorms orturbulence.   Meanwhile, Piper had become convinced that pilot error waslargely to blame. The company, which offers free optionaltraining for all Malibu buyers, urged tough new standards forpilots to meetstandards reflecting the same kind of specialqualifications that pilots of jets or twin-engine propelleraircraft must have.   For Piper, the mystery surrounding its most popular andprofitable model was aggravating a bigger issue: how tosurvive as a company. With 95,000 Piper planes in service,the company had become a favorite target forproduct-liability lawsuits over the past decade. &quot;TheAmerican tort system is a form of extortion,&quot; says PiperChairman M. Stuart Millar. Knowing that cases involvingsmall-plane accidents are costly to defend, Mr. Millar says,lawyers sue even if evidence points to the pilot being solelyat fault. The subtle message, he says: &quot;Why don't you give me$100,000, and I'll go away.&quot;   After he bought the company in 1987, Mr. Millardiscontinued its insurance coverage and set up a legal teamto fight &quot;nuisance suits,&quot; to make such actions unattractiveto lawyers in crash cases. While the strategy did seem toward off suits, it also spooked would-be financial backersworried about the lack of insurance.   The Malibu crashes were the last straw; the company hasbeen named in three suits so far, including actions filed bythe Schreiber and Hager families. Only since gaining Chapter11 protection in July has Piper been able to find an angel:Cleveland-based investor Cyrus Eaton, who proposes to resumemanufacturing offshore -- possibly in Canada or Russia --where there might be less exposure to such litigation.   Most Malibu owners tend to blame their fellow pilots, notPiper. &quot;It's the slickest plane I've ever flown,&quot; says MarkFeldberg, a Los Angeles pilot who works in film production.&quot;But if it gets away from you, you can't sit around for along time saying, `Isn't that interesting.'&quot;   Investigators are looking at the possibility that a devicethat heats the pitot tube -- a vital link to the air-speedindicator -- may have been turned off during icingconditions. That could have understated the plane's speed,leading pilots to try to avoid stalling by switching off theautopilot and initiating an unnecessary and dangerous dive toincrease the plane's speed.   &quot;Unfortunately, the way you would get out of that would beto pull up and pull up hard&quot; on the controls, and &quot;that'swhat could rip off the wings and tail,&quot; Mr. Feldberg says.And he notes that during Piper's three-day Malibu course, theautopilot was &quot;barely covered at all.&quot; (Piper says it's nowbeefed up that part of its training.)   But Brent Silver, the air-safety consultant, believes itis wrong to accuse pilots. Why make a plane &quot;so hot that onlyChuck Yeager can fly it if it's to be sold to garden varietypilots?&quot; he asks.   Mr. Rich, the lead safety-board investigator, agrees thatit is &quot;just too simplistic&quot; to blame the pilots for the rareinflight breakups. But his team hasn't been able to find aspecific culprit behind the accidents. &quot;We've exhausted allthe avenues,&quot; Mr. Rich says. As the final report takes shape,it includes &quot;quite a laundry list (of new recommendations)concerning the autopilot,&quot; and the first government-mandatedtraining requirements for pilots of Malibus and other zippyplanes in its class.   Soaring down the California coast, Charles Kissner keepshis hand on the yoke of his Malibu -- because a tug there is&quot;the first sign that the autopilot is doing something.&quot; As hecruises 25,000 feet above Big Sur, the president of AristacomInternational Inc., an Alameda, Calif., telephonecomputer-switching software company, says he can't explainwhy the planes that crashed managed to &quot;get away&quot; from theseven pilots.   But all the attention focused on the inflight breakups hasdone one thing, he says. &quot;It's raised pilot awareness to anincredibly high level, which is where it should have been allalong.&quot;</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
