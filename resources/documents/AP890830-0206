We should give modern music and dramathe place they deserve,'' said Hans Landesmann, a member of thefestival board, in an interview.   ``There is no crisis but just time for change. This necessity hasbeen in the air for years.''   Gerard Mortier, director of the Brussels Opera, was recentlynamed artistic director of the Salzburg Festival with a mandate torevamp the cultural showcase.   For years, the festival had been criticized for being tooexpensive and a storehouse of the artistic totems of Karajan, itslongtime guiding spirit who died July 16 of a heart attack at age 81.   The five-week festival opened July 27 with Giuseppe Verdi's opera``Un Ballo in Maschera,'' under the baton of Sir Georg Solti.   Karajan had been criticized for his domineering and conservativestance. Italian media called the festival an ``intrigue nest,''totally subordinated to Karajan's commercial interests.   In his long career, Karajan made more than 800 recordings, manyof them with the Berlin and Vienna orchestras. His fortune wasestimated at 3.5 billion schillings ($270 million). Although heresigned from the five-member directorate last August after anillness, he had retained a veto over virtually all productions.   Landesmann, a wealthy Vienna businessman with internationalcontacts, was asked by the government to work out a reform program.In June, before Karajan's death, the board, overruling him, agreedin principle to Landesmann's plan to modernize festival management.Under the plan, to be formally adopted in fall, the unpaid honoraryfive-man directorate will be replaced by a permanent salariedthree-member board.   The new board, comprising a president, an artistic director andan economic director will work full time for the festival,Landesmann said.   ``We need new, forward-thinking people in the management, muchmore aware of the contemporary scene,'' he said.   Albert Moser, the festival president and a Karajan loyalist whois to retire in 1991, will also be replaced.   In another major change, Landesmann said he would like to includeartists in the new artistic advisory board to counsel on newprojects. He would also like to see more film and video galas andexhibits to be staged during the festival _ the world'slongest-running and most costly one.   While not playing down the merits of Italian traditional operas,which have been performed here every year, Landesmann proposes toinclude other composers, such as Richard Strauss or Alban Berg, theAustrian artist who combined atonality with the lyric and dramaticfeatures of the Viennese romantic tradition.   There is talk among festival organizers to devote the 2,600-seatGreat Festival Hall to foreign classical opera and the LittleFestival Hall to Mozart productions.   ``We want a repertoire consistent with the line of Mozart'sheritage, something specific, typical of Salzburg,'' Landesmann said.   In an attempt to prevent the rise of another domineering maestrosuch as Karajan, Landesmann said no permanent conductor will benamed, but invitations will go out to such well-known figures asSolti, Ricardo Muti, Claudio Abbado or Sir John Pritchard, all ofwhom were in Austria this summer.   ``Karajan was opposed to reforms. He was an old man and he didn'tlike changes. He was opposed to see new people and he used to askwhy should we change the structure of the festival,'' Landesmannsaid.   Karajan, a native of Salzburg, who had conducted at the festivalsince 1948, was its sole artistic director in 1956-60 and a memberof the directorate since 1964.   Now in its 69th year, the Salzburg festival pays some of thehighest performer fees in Europe, and charges some of thecontinent's top ticket prices.   Five years ago, government auditors urged festival organizers tospend less. Press chief Hans Widrich said the festival runs an anualbudget of $27 million, of which state subsdies total $7.7 millionwith the rest coming from ticket sales, radio and TV rights.   Ticket sales this year range from $4 for standing room at aconcert of sacred music to $250 for the best seat at one of theopera performances.   However, not all agree on the need for reform.   Solti, musical director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, whoreplaced Karajan for the Verdi opera, said the ticket prices shouldstay as they are.   ``I don't believe that lowering their price and making them cost10 schillings (77 cents) apiece would solve anything. All hoteldoormen will rush to buy them officially and then resell them on theblack market at a high profit,'' he said.   Solti said he was not concerned about the artistic quality of thefestival, which he considers very good.   ``Politicians are talking too much. Once its quality goes downthen you can say, `hey, we must change something.' But not for thetime being,'' he said.   British film director John Schlesinger, who staged Verdi's operaon the opening night, praised Salzburg, saying ``There is no housein the world offering the kind of facilities, expertise andofficialdom's support we get here. We don't think we will find againsimilar conditions.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE></DOC>
