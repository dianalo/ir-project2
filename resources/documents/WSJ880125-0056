Vice President George Bush is expected to come away from this Saturday's state convention with the most national delegates -- as many as 35. Most important, he has avoided a humiliating defeat in the state that eight years ago provided him with his largest margin of victory. But to salvage the situation here in the first contest of the 1988 presidential race, Mr. Bush has had to spend enormous amounts of time, money and resources, and he now is poised to prevail only after resorting to lawsuits and striking a deal with Rep. Jack Kemp of New York on a credentials dispute.    Mr. Kemp may come away with as many as 30 delegates, a second-place finish far stronger than his performance here warrants. But in the process he has come out looking like an indecisive opportunist who handed victory to the very party establishment figures he set out to defeat.    Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster, will leave Michigan with only a dozen delegates even though just a few weeks ago he expected to use this contest to stun the party and gain credibility for his campaign. He had the strongest showing in the first round of battles and was able to wrest control of the Michigan state party, but now he is watching a decisive victory slip away and is finding himself more alienated than ever from the party establishment.    The final loser in this bewildering process -- 17 months of elections, caucuses, court battles, bickering and threats -- is the Michigan state GOP, a party that is so deeply divided and wounded that Saturday's state convention, where the first 77 GOP presidential delegates are to be formally selected, will take on the air of a combat hospital. The party, moreover, has endangered the prospects that it can deliver Michigan to the eventual GOP nominee in the fall.    &quot;Any time you put such collective stupidity on public display it's bound to have a negative impact on the party,&quot; says Eddie Mahe, a Republican political consultant. &quot;It's corrosive and petty and it makes you wonder if we'll ever get a positive feeling in November in Michigan.&quot;    With the Robertson forces contemplating rump conventions this weekend and vowing to press a bitter credentials fight, the ultimate resolution of the months of contention may not come until the Republican National Convention sorts out the claims and counterclaims in New Orleans this summer.    The seeds of this blood feud were sown in August 1986, when Mr. Robertson mobilized thousands of political newcomers to win a stunning victory in a series of precinct-level elections that never before were contested seriously, let alone chronicled by the national press. Since that embarrassment, Mr. Bush has been clawing back, with Rep. Kemp holding the balance of power.    Once the confrontation turned from a test of organizational acumen to a struggle of pure power, the Robertson camp was at a disadvantage. And now, with Mr. Kemp, a sometime Robertson ally, instructing his state delegates to side with the Bush camp over a critical legal question, Mr. Robertson plans to portray Michigan as a &quot;corrupt bargain&quot; and make it an issue throughout the nation. The cry to his legions of supporters will be: &quot;Remember Michigan.&quot;    &quot;All along this road, they thought they could break us,&quot; Robertson campaign organizer Marc Nuttle says of the Bush camp. &quot;Now all they have left is to gang up on us. But the real story here is this: Who would have thought George Bush would need someone else's help to beat Pat Robertson?&quot;    Saturday's state convention in Grand Rapids is the culmination of some of the most arcane political maneuvering in modern American history. Mr. Kemp has been allied with both Mr. Robertson and Mr. Bush. The Bush forces have accused the Robertson camp of trying to change the rules. The Robertson forces have accused the Bush camp of trying to steal the process. Leaders of the Bush effort themselves began wearing red &quot;Thou Shalt Not Steal&quot; buttons. And Mr. Kemp admits that the situation is so confusing that &quot;there isn't anybody on my side of the debate or in the press who can tell us what's happening.&quot;    In the meantime, no one has mentioned a national issue here in months. &quot;We've talked about selection methods, at-large delegates and judges' orders, but no one has mentioned Central America or the arms agreement,&quot; says John Long, executive director of the Bush campaign in this state.    The result is that the Michigan GOP, which had hoped to steal a march on Iowa and New Hampshire by choosing the first national delegates, has been humiliated, its state convention has been lost in a fog of acrimony and its delegates will be elected under a cloud.    &quot;This is the old-fashioned way of politics, but in this atmosphere it just can't work,&quot; says Joseph Schlesinger, a Michigan State University political scientist. &quot;Once the spotlight was turned on it, the appearance was ugly.&quot;    Mr. Bush's strong showing in county conventions earlier this month came after a county judge ruled that 1,200 party leaders, most of them Bush supporters, should be allowed to participate. The GOP state central committee, controlled by Mr. Robertson, had voted to exclude them.    &quot;The Robertson group peaked too soon,&quot; says George Grassmuck, a University of Michigan political scientist. &quot;The party establishment was able to wear them down. We're at a stage when the premium is on having a good parliamentarian, and that's the strength of the party establishment, not the zealots.&quot;    This bickering may have important political implications as the 1988 political season moves forward. Mr. Bush needed a win here to get off to a good start and to blunt the effect of a likely loss to Sen. Robert Dole in Iowa a week later. The vice president's advisers worry that consecutive losses in Michigan and Iowa, both of which Mr. Bush won in 1980, would endanger his lead in the third contest, New Hampshire, and jeopardize his campaign.    Meanwhile, an angry debate rages in conservative circles, with Mr. Robertson's forces arguing that Rep. Kemp has sold out the right. &quot;He's setting up the liberals to take over the party,&quot; says Mr. Nuttle.    Mr. Dole has stayed in the background. Recognizing that none of the 77 national convention delegates to be selected Saturday will be bound by law to support any candidate in New Orleans, he chose not to participate in the process. But he hopes to pick up the support of some of the delegates as the primary season unfolds.    &quot;These people are free agents ready to be wined and dined,&quot; says former Rep. Colleen Engler, the chairman of the Dole effort in Michigan, &quot;and that's what we're going to do.&quot;    ---                      The Michigan Muddle   Key events in the process to select 77 delegates from Michigan to the Republican National Convention:   Aug. 5, 1986 -- Precinct delegate elections.
