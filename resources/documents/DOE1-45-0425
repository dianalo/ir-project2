Directly after the drilling operation in December 1979 a seriesof thermo-mechanical experiments started. Convergence is measured underisothermal and nonisothermal conditions. The thermally induced pressureof the salt on a cylinder, simulating a canister, was measured for severalthermal loads. An evaluation of the most important results is given.The role of the lithostatic pressure (p) on the results is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
