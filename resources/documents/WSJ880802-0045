Apcar (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FRB GOVMT NCB </CO><IN> BCY BNK FIN </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The bank regulatory agency that caused a furor among creditors by stripping away almost all of First RepublicBank Corp.'s assets turns out to be its No. 1 creditor.    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. leads the list of First RepublicBank note and bondholders with a claim estimated at $51.1 million, according to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition filed here over the weekend by the Texas holding company. The FDIC triggered the nation's second-largest banking bailout Friday by transferring 40 of First RepublicBank's banking units to North Carolina's NCNB Corp. in a $4 billion rescue.    The FDIC action has prompted protests from creditors who believe the holding company still had many solvent, profitable bank units. In the eyes of many bondholders, the FDIC's action treated them like common stockholders and rendered their bonds and notes nearly worthless. Yesterday, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading in the Texas company's stocks and bonds and will seek to have them delisted. But before the trading halt, some bonds skidded in value.    Before the suspension, some bonds traded as low as $50 per $1,000 face value, down from $125 on Friday, one bond trader said. &quot;I've never seen bonds traded this low. People are shellshocked,&quot; said Jay H. Lustig, a bond trader with Santa Monica, Calif.-based Los Angeles Securities. A small amount of First RepublicBank common traded at 75 cents, unchanged from Friday.    Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing for possible downgrade some First RepublicBank's debt; about $990 million of the company's debt is affected, Moody's estimated. At the same time, it confirmed ratings on NCNB's senior debentures and notes as well as its subordinated notes and its prime 1 rating for commercial paper. Moody's is reviewing its ratings of the deposits and letters of credit of NCNB Texas National Bank, the newly formed successor to First RepublicBank's bank units. The agency withdrew its ratings on First RepublicBank Houston's deposits and letters of credit.    The FDIC wouldn't comment on the $51.1 million First RepublicBank note that it took in 1983 when the former RepublicBank Corp. purchased at a premium certain assets and deposits of a failed bank in Midland, Texas. It isn't unusual for the FDIC to be owed money by a failed bank, but rarely is it the leading creditor.    The agency has stressed that a new &quot;bridge bank&quot; law allowed it to freely transfer failed bank units from one holding company to another without offering any protection for holding company creditors or stockholders. Past bailouts offered both creditors and stock holders some relief; in the 1984 bailout of Continental Illinois, creditors were fully protected.    The bankruptcy filings encompass First RepublicBank Corp., which isn't related to First Republic Bancorp. of San Francisco, and IFRB Corp., a holding company for nonbanking assets, but they didn't include Republic Money Orders Inc., Dallas, and RepublicBank Delaware, a credit card bank unit. The Delaware bank and the money order unit are expected to continue their businesses without interruption, First RepublicBank said. A Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing gives the company an opportunity to reorganize and work out a plan to pay its debts. Because the companies may be insolvent, it is possible the Chapter 11 filings could convert to Chapter 7 status, leading to a liquidation.    First RepublicBank listed assets of $535.7 million and liabilities of $788.2 million. IFRB valued its assets at $279.2 million and liabilities at $638.9 million. First RepublicBank said the asset values are estimates and include &quot;substantial sums which may ultimately prove worthless,&quot; including intercompany accounts and receivables from former subsidiary banks that now belong to the FDIC and NCNB Texas. </TEXT></DOC>
