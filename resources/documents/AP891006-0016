In the Oct. 8 issue of Parade magazine the Soviet-born dancerrecalls from his childhood ``this absolutely pathological urge tobe independent from everybody.''   ``I still do want independence,'' he said.   Baryshnikov, 41, defected when the Bolshoi Ballet visitedToronto in 1974. He since has expanded his artistic horizons inmovies and on Broadway, and he's become adept at capitalism,successfully hawking his line of dancewear and introducing a newperfume.   Independence also prevails in his personal life.   Baryshnikov, who remains unmarried, has two children _8-year-old Alexandra, by actress Jessica Lange, and 3-month-oldPeter, by ballet dancer Lisa Rinehart.   ``Am I handicapped? A weirdo that I cannot deal with it? Or am Itoo selfish?'' he said. ``My idea about the family ... it's noteverybody's idea. My close friends _ that's my family.''</TEXT><DATELINE>PLUM, Pa.
