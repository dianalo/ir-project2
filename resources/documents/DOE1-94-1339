Designed to allow direct and easy accessto advanced methods of analysis and decision support for a broad andheterogeneous group of users, these systems combine data base management,system simulation, operations research techniques such as optimization,interactive data analysis, elements of advanced decision technology,and artificial intelligence, with a friendly and conversational, symbolicdisplay oriented user interface. Important features of the interfaceare the use of several parallel or alternative styles of interactionand display, indlucing colour graphics and natural language. Combiningquantitative numerical methods with qualitative and heuristic approaches,and giving the user direct and interactive control over the systems function,human knowledge, experience and judgement are integrated with formalapproaches into a tightly coupled man-machine system through an intelligentand easily accessible user interface. 4 drawings, 42 references.</TEXT></DOC>
