Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook said Arco still seeks foreign oil and gas assets despite an announcement last week that it plans to sell its 24% stake in Britoil PLC under a sweetened offer from British Petroleum Co.    Mr. Cook said Arco doesn't yet have any potential acquisitions lined up, but added that the stake in Britoil let &quot;people know that we're interested, and I would hope that opportunities emerge.&quot;    As previously reported, Arco had planned to acquire slightly less than 50% of Britoil in a two-step process to thwart British Petroleum's advances. But Arco last week said it plans to sell its 121.2 million Britoil shares under British Petroleum's sweetened offer of 500 pence ($8.94) a share.    Mr. Cook said Arco may yet tender its stake to a third party if a higher bid emerges. &quot;The shares haven't been tendered to BP, so that speaks for itself I guess,&quot; Mr. Cook said. </TEXT></DOC>
