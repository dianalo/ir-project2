<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-77-0297 </DOCNO><TEXT>A stable train of compressed Stokes pulses (to {similar_to}10 nsec) isobtained in a stimulated Brillouin fiber ring laser (of length L = 83m) by periodically interrupting the argon-ion cw pump beam with an intraringcavity acousto-optic modulator. Interruption of the pump action, at eachround-trip time t/sub r/{approx_equal}Ln/c, permits damping of the excitedsound waves that accumulate at the entry of the fiber owing to the inertialresponse of the material, well described by the coherent three-wave stimulatedBrillouin scattering model (C3W-SBS equations). Amplification and compressionof the backscattered Stokes pulse are limited by nonlinear optical Kerreffect, which is incorporated into the C3W-SBS equations.</TEXT></DOC>
