(MCC) of Austin,Texas; Matra Datavision of Tewksbury, Mass.; Cimplex of Campbell, Calif.; PieDesign Systems of Santa Clara, Calif.; and Chips and Technologies, also ofSanta Clara.andP;  Most of the companies will use Objectivity/DB to developengineering-related applications.andM;MCC, a cooperative research venture with 50 member companies, has chosenObjectivity/DB as a prototyping tool for its CAD framework research.andP;  BothSaber and Objectivity are members of the research venture.andM;The research is aimed at reducing the time and costs associated with toolintegration within CAD systems.andP;  A CAD framework consists of a userinterface, methodology management, intertool communication, datarepresentation and data management.andM;&quot;MCC has said object-oriented technology is the basis for the frameworksolution, not relational,&quot; Field said.andP;  &quot;Object-oriented database technologyhas arrived.andP;  It's no longer research.andP;  That's a good message for theindustry and obviously for us.&quot;andM;Objectivity/DB has also been licensed to Chips and Technologies fordevelopment of its internal library manager.andM;Cimplex will use Objectivity/DB as the data management system for itsmechanical CAD (MCAD) tools.andP;  Matra Datavision has also selectedObjectivity/DB for development of its future MCAD products.andP;  In addition, thedatabase will be used for future product development by Pie Design Systems,which makes CAE tools.andM;&quot;We set out to make a product for CAD, CAE and CASE end users and resellers,and we think these new relationships indicate our success,&quot; Field said.andM;The Objectivity database runs on RISC/Ultrix, VAX/Ultrix and other Unixsystems.andP;  A port of Objectivity/DB to VAX/VMS is currently in beta test, andthe company plans to port the run-time segment of the product to DOS sometimein the future.andM;The applications development system for those building an application usingObjectivity/DB is priced at $15,000.andP;  The database development system is$30,000, and the run-time system is $5,000.andP;  Quantity discounts are availablefor all three.andM;Saber-C++, available later this month, is priced at $3,995 for a single copyincluding technical support and one year of maintenance.andP;  Volume discountsare available.andP;  Saber-C is priced at $2,995 per copy, and has the sameone-year support and maintenance agreement.andM;Objectivity Inc. is located at 800 El Camino Real, Menlo Park, CA 94025,(415) 688-8000.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
