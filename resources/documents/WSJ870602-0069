They are sending emissaries to Tokyo to implore the Japanese to buy more oil.    &quot;A lot of people are coming from the Middle East, saying, 'Please buy now.'&quot; says Masaru Kai, the deputy general manager for petroleum supply at Nippon Oil Co. &quot;It's very much a buyers' market.&quot;    The sight of oil merchants importuning the Japanese is just one sign of how much things have changed since the oil shocks of the 1970s. Japan still imports 99% of its oil, and it still depends on the Middle East for about 70% of the supply. But the balance of power has significantly changed between Japan and the oil-producing nations. &quot;Ten years ago, they were gods,&quot; says Toshio Watanabe, a director in the Middle East bureau of the Japanese foreign ministry. &quot;Today, the relationship is more give-and-take.&quot;    The recent Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf hasn't materially changed Japanese confidence in the security of the Middle East oil supply, although it has highlighted Japan's heavy dependence on the safe passage of ships through the Persian Gulf. (Indeed, several Japanese oil tankers have been damaged by bomb attacks in recent months.) And it has prompted calls by members of the U.S. Congress for Japan to share some of the burden, at least financially, for a strategic role in the gulf that is currently borne largely by the U.S.    &quot;This is a good time to look at the security of oil supply,&quot; says a senior official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI. &quot;This time we face real risks.&quot; But he says few of his fellow Japanese seem to care about Japan's oil vulnerability in the Persian Gulf.    In part, Japanese complacency can be traced to a world-wide oversupply of oil selling for about $18 a barrel. But it is also rooted in the success of a sophisticated, 13-year strategy that began after the first oil shock of 1973, a strategy designed to blend diplomacy, economic aid and private business dealings into better relations in the Middle East and a more secure oil supply from the Persian Gulf.    On the diplomatic front, Japan has stepped up its efforts to make friends in the Middle East. It has offered technical assistance to the oil producers, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It has increased economic aid to non-oil exporters, such as Egypt and Jordan. Japan has set up numerous so-called megaprojects in the Middle East, and it has tried to keep several of them running even after they were bombed in wars or became commercially untenable. On the purely diplomatic level, Japan has attempted to serve as a go-between in the Iran-Iraq war.    At the same time, Japan has clearly learned a thing or two about the international oil business. It has systematically reduced its oil purchases from big producers such as Saudi Arabia, choosing instead to buy from smaller producers and hoping to gain some bargaining power with the smaller Middle East producers.    &quot;I think the Japanese have recognized the importance that their size as a purchaser gives them,&quot; says James Placke, a former U.S. diplomat in Saudi Arabia, now a Washington consultant. &quot;They have gone out of their way to cultivate Oman. In the United Arab Emirates -- which is really Abu Dhabi and Dubai -- they have been effective in playing those two off against each other.&quot;    And back home, Japan has conserved oil, diversified fuel sources and put together a stockpile equal to 140 days of domestic consumption. Many Western analysts believe the fuel stockpile is sufficient to withstand any shut-off of Mideast oil, given the need the Gulf States have to export oil.    It isn't that Japanese political leaders are ignoring the issue completely. &quot;Every day, I look at a map of the Persian Gulf and the Straits of Hormuz,&quot; said Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari in a speech last Friday, noting that &quot;60% of Japan's oil imports flow through the Persian Gulf.&quot; But he noted that Japan's constitution bars the Japanese military from patrolling in foreign waters.    Also last Friday, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a group of reporters that he is preparing to discuss Japan's role in the Persian Gulf at the forthcoming economic summit meeting in Venice. He ruled out a Japanese military presence in the gulf but said he understood U.S. complaints about Japan's &quot;free ride&quot; and said that Japan can't take the attitude that &quot;it's all right as long as our tankers are safe.&quot;    It was a far more vulnerable Japan that found itself on the Arab list of &quot;unfriendly nations&quot; back in 1973, immediately after the Yom Kippur war. Threatened by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait with a cutback in oil, the Japanese government was thrown into vigorous debate. In the end, Japan walked a diplomatic tightrope, trying to please everybody -- the U.S., Israel and the Arab world. Japan called for Palestinian self-determination but fell far short of breaking off diplomatic ties with Israel.    The new policy appeased the Arab nations without damaging ties to the U.S., and oil supplies from the gulf were uninterrupted.    It was only the beginning of Japan's diplomatic efforts in the Mideast, however. The foreign ministry began training a corps of Mideast specialists, sending young recruits to Arab nations for two years of language study. Foreign aid to the Mideast had been increased sharply by the late 1970s, amounting to 27% of Japanese overseas aid.    To the oil-producing countries, Japan increased its direct investment in projects and stepped up technical assistance.    But it took years for Japanese oil buyers to gain sophistication. In the late 1970s, Japanese trading houses nearly begged for Mideast oil at any price and, in doing so, helped to drive the price of a barrel of oil to more than $38.    &quot;In 1978 and 1979, we were just crazy,&quot; admits Minoru Takei, the general manager of the crude-oil department at Nissho Iwai Corp., a major Japanese trading house.    Many oil analysts say the Japanese have become better traders and oil dealers over the past seven years, however, and analysts even attribute the oil-price collapse of 1986 in part to shrewd Japanese tactics.    &quot;In the past several years, the Japanese have put emphasis on low pricing,&quot; says Mr. Placke, the former Middle East diplomat. &quot;They have become very tough negotiators. And they are good traders in the market.&quot;    One obvious strategy was to reduce purchases from the biggest and most powerful of the OPEC suppliers. In 1976, Japan bought more than 50% of its crude oil from either Saudi Arabia or Iran, but that figure dropped to 20% by last year.    Meanwhile, Japan turned to smaller suppliers in the gulf, such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and non-OPEC Oman. &quot;Take Oman,&quot; says Mr. Kai of Nippon Oil. &quot;Japan buys more than 50% of its total output. And they don't have enough capacity for storage. So we have some bargaining power there. In the UAE, they produce 1.2 million barrels a day. Japan buys 800,000 barrels. So we have some bargaining power there, too.&quot;    Mr. Kai says that last year Japanese buyers used this leverage to pressure oil suppliers to cut prices, given the oversupply. &quot;If one breaks, the others follow,&quot; he says. And, according to other analysts, the major international oil companies then put pressure on the biggest OPEC producers to match the cuts of the smaller suppliers.    For all its success, however, the Japanese oil industry has had failures in the Middle East, too. One of the most ambitious Japanese strategies of the 1970s was to build huge projects in the Mideast, both for their commercial value and in hopes of securing a steady supply of oil. In many cases, the strategy backfired.    More than 60 Japanese companies teamed up with Saudi Arabia in an $11 billion project, obtaining in return a promise of &quot;bonus oil&quot; from Saudi Arabia at a fixed price. But when the spot price of oil dropped below the price of the bonus oil, the agreement became worthless. The Japanese gave up on bonus oil in 1986.    The most notorious of the Japanese white elephants has been the Bandar Khomeini petrochemical complex in Iran. The project was organized primarily by Mitsui andamp; Co., the large Japanese trading house. Completing the project has been pushed by the Japanese government in the face of repeated bomb damage to the construction work that began in 1973. Total losses, insured by Japan, will exceed 600 billion yen, or more than $4 billion at today's exchange rates, according to Mitsui officials.    The Bandar Khomeini project is still seen as a symbol of cooperation between Japan and Iran, but it is also a noteworthy casualty of the Iran-Iraq war. When the war broke out, the complex became a bombing target for the Iraqis.    In 1979, the government, which had encouraged Mitsui to proceed with the project, declared the complex a &quot;national project,&quot; which gave Mitsui some government insurance against losses and some government funds. Since then, Iran has missed payments on loans extended by the Export-Import Bank of Japan.    Several Japanese engineers and construction workers have been injured at Bandar Khomeini by bombing attacks. Work is currently at a halt; the project is unfinished.    &quot;Looking at the experience of Bandar Khomeini, the Japanese government is reluctant to invest in any projects in Iraq,&quot; says Yoshinori Suematsu, a deputy director in the petroleum department of MITI.    Mitsui's sorry experience has also soured Japanese business on large construction projects in politically unstable regions of the Mideast. And the recent attack on the U.S. frigate offers all the more reason for the Japanese to avoid investing, although they remain eager to buy oil.    &quot;We're still buying a lot of oil from Iran and a lot of oil from Iraq,&quot; says Minoru Takei, the general manager of crude oil supply at Nissho Iwai.    Political instability may be part of the reason, but pure economic fear has also prevented many Japanese companies from investing aggressively in the Mideast. As the price of oil has dropped, oil revenue in the Middle East countries has dropped, endangering their fiscal health and raising doubts about their ability to pay for the work.    &quot;At the moment, there are no big projects in the Middle East, because the Middle East doesn't have any money to invest,&quot; says Mr. Takei, the general manager of the crude-oil department at Nissho Iwai.    Nissho Iwai has invested in a number of projects that have turned out less than happily. Listen to Mr. Takei:    &quot;In 1970-71, we started a joint petrochemical complex with Mr. Shah, but after the revolution we lost the money. . . . We're now in negotiation with Iraq to construct a pipeline from Iraq to the east coast of Saudi Arabia. . . . &quot; But he quickly adds that many Japanese private interests have invested heavily in Iraq, only to find the country in severe economic trouble because of the war and unable to pay many of its debts. &quot;I think most Japanese trading companies, steel companies and shipbuilders have bad accounts in Iraq,&quot; he says.    As part of their pitch in Tokyo, many representatives of Middle East governments are also asking for Japanese investment in the Gulf region. &quot;The voices of the Middle East countries are growing very loud -- for investment and for technical transfer,&quot; says Koji Muto, a Middle East specialist at the Japan External Trade Organization in Tokyo.    The visits from the oil-producing countries encourage thinking about Japan-Middle East relations in the long term. Says Akihiro Shima, a planning officer at Japan National Oil Corp. &quot;The oil sellers come in and say, 'If Japan is friendly to us, then even if there is an emergency, the oil supply will be secure.'&quot; But Mr. Shima says he remains largely unimpressed by these arguments. &quot;If the Middle East countries don't sell their petroleum,&quot; he says, &quot;their economies will shrink. They are obliged to sell petroleum.&quot;    That is a shortsighted and perhaps foolhardy attitude, some Japanese critics say. Quite a few Japanese government planners and oil executives see higher oil prices, and perhaps even another oil shock sometime in the early 1990s. They figure that with oil at $18 a barrel, the non-OPEC countries won't have the incentive to explore. But the consuming countries will have plenty of incentive to consume, eventually driving up the price and giving renewed power to OPEC.    &quot;I think the situation will change fairly soon,&quot; says Shigeki Koyama, the director of the Japanese Institute of Middle Eastern Economics, a private think tank. &quot;The general perception is that the oil crisis is over,&quot; says Mr. Koyama. &quot;My opinion is different: The oil crisis isn't over.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
