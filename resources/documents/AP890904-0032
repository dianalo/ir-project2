(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Shots have been fired and barricades set upas a coal strike has turned into open warfare in southern WestVirginia.   In Rum Creek Hollow, striking miners have built a barrier of oldtires, railroad ties and even a soggy, used couch to keep coaltrucks out.   About a mile up the road at the mouth of Slab Fork Hollow,pickets have erected a shield of timbers and sandbags to block thebullets from automatic weapons and other guns they say have beenfired by mine guards and non-union workers.   There is evidence of violence on both sides, according to statepolice Superintendent Jack Buckalew.   ``Some of the (mine) equipment has been hit by gunfire,'' hesaid. ``It's obvious there have been gunshots into the picketshacks.''   The United Mine Workers union has been on strike against PittstonCoal Group Inc. since April in a dispute over wages and benefits.   The strike affects 1,900 Pittston miners in West Virginia,Virginia and Kentucky, including 300 in Logan County. Pittston hasbeen seeking concessions that many miners fear will set anindustry-wide precedent.   There have been minor incidents of violence throughout thestrike. The violence began to increase during wildcat walkouts inthe East and Midwest in June and July.   The situation became much worse when the A.T. Massey Coal Co.reopened the Rum Creek mine in early August. On Aug. 21, the strikewas expanded to Massey's non-union operations in Logan County.   On Sunday, about 10,000 people rallying in southwestern Virginiaheard Jesse Jackson and UMW President Richard Trumka blast theRepublican presidential administrations of the 1980s for what theycalled a hostile attitude toward labor.   ``During the past 10 years, political leaders such as PresidentGeorge Bush have used the American flag to pull the wool over oureyes,'' Jackson said.   Pittston's Elkay Mining Co. subsidiary is within a mile up RumCreek from Massey's operation, now being run by Con-Serv Inc., anon-union contractor. The previous contractor encountered financialproblems during wildcat strikes in July.   While union officials such as the West Coast farm workers' leaderCesar Chavez have praised the UMW for its commitment tonon-violence, Pittston President Michael Odom has accused the unionof thousands of violent acts since the strike began. In Virginia, ajudge fined the union nearly $4.5 million in July for what he called``acts of terror,'' including assaulting and threatening people, inthe coalfields.   Along Rum Creek, gunfire has erupted several times, authoritiessaid. On Aug. 19, a union member was wounded in the arm. He washospitalized for a week, and six non-union workers were charged withattempted murder.   Eight days later, one of the six was charged with attemptedmurder again after driving a loader through a blockade of downedtrees, picking up a striking UMW member in the bucket and carryinghim more than 50 feet before being stopped by a police officer whowitnessed the scene.   Both sides blame the other for the violence.   Richard Zigmond, president of Massey's Rum Creek Coal Sales Inc.,said pickets have been firing into mine property, damaging equipmentand endangering workers. He said trucks have been hit by a barrageof rocks and steel balls fired from slingshots. And he said minersswarmed over an endloader one day last week, forcing guards to usetear gas.   Eight UMW members including Charles Gilliam, a former member ofthe West Virginia House of Delegates, have been charged withthrowing rocks at company employees and vehicles.   Huddled next to a picket shack behind the timbers and sandbags,the UMW members complained that security guards and non-union truckdrivers are heavily armed, while pickets are barred by a court orderfrom carrying guns.   Zigmond says the employees open fire only to protect themselvesand only when fired upon first.   Each side is digging in as the violence escalates.   ``It's a real confrontation there between the people workingthere and the pickets,'' said Buckalew, the police superintendent.``One side has sandbags, the other side has bulletproof guardshacks.''</TEXT></DOC>
