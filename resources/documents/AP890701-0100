Such a bill never materialized.   The committee did vote to restore money for the V-22 Ospreyhelicopter and F-14D Tomcat fighter by reducing spending for the B-2stealth bomber. But it refrained from any other major additions andfound the money by cutting other programs.   Then _ against the advice of Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis. _ thecommittee chose a $295 billion defense bill that reflected its ownprocurement priorities rather than those proposed by DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney.   ``A leaner, meaner version,'' Aspin said a day after theWednesday vote as he compared the final committee package to the$7.1 billion in add-ons members had originally sought.   Members of the panel explained that their plan remained withinCheney's budget numbers. They also expressed dismay with pressure torubber-stamp a proposal crafted by a defense secretary just 39 dayson the job.   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., joined with Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa., andNorman Sisisky, D-Va., to save the V-22, the tilt-rotor aircraftthat is manufactured by Boeing Helicopter Co. in Pennsylvania andBell Helicopter Textron Inc., in Texas.   Their amendment also restored money for the F-14D, which is builtby Grumman Corp., on Long Island.   To get $157 million for the Marine Corps' V-22 and about $1billion for the Navy's F-14D, the lawmakers reduced spending on theMH53 helicopters and canceled multi-year purchases of the E-2C andF@A-18 aircraft.   The other amendment approved by the committee provides about $1.2billion for the National Guard and reserves by reducing $500 millionin procurement money for the Air Force's B-2 and $524 million thathad been earmarked for Air Force aircraft spares and repair parts.   Cheney, commenting in a statement the day after the vote, saidCongress wants to cut defense spending but doesn't want to cancelany systems.   ``We must not preserve the fiction that we can keep all theweapons and bases everyone wants and still spend less money,'' thedefense secretary said.   Weldon disagreed, saying his amendment ``does not affect thebottom line of Cheney's budget.''   The Pennsylvania Republican said it was unfair to cancel the V-22on the eve of testing the aircraft, which is designed to take offlike a helicopter and fly like a plane.   ``I like Dick Cheney but he got advice from pencil-pushers,''Weldon said.   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said that based on the dollaramount, Cheney ``got 95 percent of what he wanted.''   But the ranking Republican on the Armed Services panel, Rep. BillDickinson of Alabama, criticized the vote, calling it a ``bad dayfor good government'' because the panel failed to face the realityof a budget crunch and allowed business as usual.   Dickinson expressed the hope that this will change when the fullHouse takes up the defense bill.   But Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., who voted against the Cheneybudget, objected to the ``good government'' argument.   ``It's incumbent upon me to exercise my judgment not acquiesce tothe secretary of defense,'' Dellums said. ``I've been on the jobmore weeks than he. ... I've written nine military budgets.''   Dellums said there was some resentment among Democrats on thecommittee that the chairman suggested his ``own membership shouldnot have a right to assess a budget.''   Only nine of the panel's 31 Democrats supported Aspin's amendmentto accept the Cheney budget. </TEXT></DOC>
