In a ruling Friday, the FCC's common carrier bureau said MartinMarietta Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. failed to prove theirclaim that American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. violated regulatoryguidelines by offering a bid below its actual costs.   ``We conclude that no compelling argument has been presentedthat the tariff proposal is patently unlawful so as to requirerejection and that no question has been presented that warrantsinvestigation at this time,'' said Brock, the FCC's top telephoneofficial.   ``This is very good news for ATandamp;T,'' company spokesman HerbLinnen said. ``We have said all along that the protest was withoutmerit _ another example of ATandamp;T's long-distance competitors usingthe regulatory arena to win something they have lost in thecompetitive marketplace.''   MCI spokeswoman Kathleen Keegan said company officials werereviewing the order to determine their options.   ``We're disappointed that the FCC apparently accepted ATandamp;T'sfaulty legal justification regarding the establishment ofpreferential rates for the government,'' Ms. Keegan said.   Martin Marietta spokesman Tom Hobson said company attorneyswould review the decision next week and decide whether to appeal tothe full commission.   The General Services Administration in December awarded 60percent of the contract to ATandamp;T and the remaining 40 percent to USSprint Communications Co. The contract is for telephone and otherhigh-tech communications equipment and could be worth up to $25billion, with a $15 billion cap on the amount that could go to ATandamp;T.   Martin Marietta and MCI challenged the GSA decision, alleging intheir petition to the FCC that ATandamp;T offered the government``unreasonably preferential and discriminatory'' rates that werebelow what it would cost ATandamp;T to provide the services.   In its response, ATandamp;T maintained its rates would cover costs andasserted that even if the commission found otherwise there waslegal precedent for offering the government preferential rates.   The system ATandamp;T and US Sprint are to provide to the government,known as FTS-2000, is a custom-designed communications networkusing digital and fiber optic technology to link the federalgovernment's expansive telecommunications system.</TEXT></DOC>
