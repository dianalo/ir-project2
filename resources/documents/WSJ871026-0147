Gloom and fear that even tougher times lie ahead pervaded panel discussions and interviews with state and local government bond specialists at the annual meeting here of the Public Securities Association, a trade group. Several members suggested a more appropriate name would be the Public Insecurities Association.    &quot;I've been in this business 14 years, and this is the worst I've ever seen,&quot; said Robert H. Muller, a vice president and head of municipal bond research at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. &quot;There's a definite pall over this meeting.&quot;    New-issue volume has plummeted because of congressional curbs on tax-exempt issuance. Some analysts fear even further limits over the next year as Congress struggles to find ways to slash the budget deficit. Morale has sunk especially low as several brokerage firms have cut back sharply on municipal bond personnel. Salomon Brothers Inc., a unit of Salomon Inc., recently announced plans to pull out of the business.    &quot;Admittedly, these are difficult days, but we should not let ourselves be discouraged,&quot; said Clayton F. Brown, the association's chairman and head of a Chicago-based bond firm bearing his name. In a speech Saturday, he condemned the 1986 tax law as &quot;a bad piece of work.&quot; He said efforts are continuing to change the law but acknowledged that prospects aren't bright.    About $78 billion of tax-exempt bonds were issued through September, Mr. Brown said, &quot;and most analysts believe the best we will do this year is around $100 billion.&quot; That would be far below the $151 billion in 1986 and even further below the record $222 billion in 1985, according to an association spokesman.    Next year &quot;could be even worse,&quot; Mr. Brown said. Moreover, tough new limits on short-term municipal note issuance have depressed that market too. Mr. Brown said volume dropped 35% in this year's first eight months from the 1986 period.    The stock market crash last week prompted many investors to rediscover the virtues of long-term, fixed-rate bonds. The popularity of Treasury securities soared because investors were attracted by their safety, liquidity and protection against early redemption. But municipal bond yields have fallen much less than Treasury bonds.    For example, yields on some long-term Treasury bonds fell to about 9 1/8% late last week from about 10 3/8% just over a week earlier. According to the Bond Buyer, a trade publication, the average yield on 25 municipal revenue bonds declined to 9.01% late last week from 9.59% a week earlier -- a decline of about half as much as on Treasury bond yields.    While many companies recently have rushed to sell new bond issues, municipal bond issuers remain wary. &quot;My view is the markets still are too unstable,&quot; said John Haupert, treasurer of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. &quot;Rates have come back down a little, but not as much as we would like.&quot;    Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young said next spring probably will be a better time to issue municipal bonds. &quot;One of the things I have come to expect is the party in power tries to make the economy look as good as possible prior to the elections, so we are looking at next spring and fall as possible times to enter the market with new issues,&quot; Mayor Young said.    Some municipal bond analysts contend that investor fears are exaggerated and this is an unusually good time to buy tax-free bonds. &quot;I think munis are extremely cheap right now,&quot; said George Friedlander, managing director for municipal bond research at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. One factor that should help municipal bonds, he said, is that new-issue volume will remain very light for the rest of this year.    Still, potential problems with Congress may lie ahead. Several municipal bond dealers worry that federal investigations of Matthews andamp; Wright Inc., a New York municipal bond firm, eventually will encourage the federal government to step into the nation's largely unregulated municipal bond business in an effort to protect investors.    Much to the dismay of some municipal specialists, the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, David Ruder, has suggested requiring increased disclosure on municipal securities. Mr. Ruder's proposals were outlined in a speech Friday delivered by Catherine McGuire, an SEC attorney.    One suggestion he said might help would be to repeal a 1975 measure known as the Tower Amendment. It prohibits the Municipal Securities Rule-making Board, a self-regulatory organization, from requiring an issuer, through a broker or dealer, to furnish information to a buyer or prospective buyer of municipal bonds.    Mr. Ruder's suggestions quickly drew criticism from many in the audience. Jeffrey Green, assistant general counsel of the Port Authority, contended that the municipal market &quot;has functioned well,&quot; and that there is no need for such changes.    But others said Mr. Ruder's ideas make sense, and many dealers said the proposals were much milder than they had feared. For example, Mr. Ruder did not suggest mandatory disclosure rules for general obligation and revenue bonds, even though his speech said &quot;problems do exist in this area.&quot;    Whatever the case, municipal disclosure does not appear to be an urgent matter in Congress now, according to Rep. Matthew J. Rinaldo (R., N.J.). &quot;I don't expect any action on this subject this year or next,&quot; he said. &quot;We have too many other pressing matters on our agenda.&quot;    Despite the gloomy atmosphere, many bond experts here contend the long-term outlook remains bright. The Salomon Brothers pullout was &quot;unnerving&quot; and &quot;unfathomable&quot; said Robert N. Downey, partner in charge of the municipal bond department at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., and head of the association's municipal bond division this year. Still, he said, &quot;This is a great long-term business. Sure, we've gone through rough times lately, but that is part of the price you pay.&quot;    Richard F. Kezer, division executive of Citicorp Investment Bank, was elected to succeed Mr. Brown as chairman of the association for 1988. Brian Hays, senior vice president of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., will be vice chairman of the association, which has 296 member firms. </TEXT></DOC>
