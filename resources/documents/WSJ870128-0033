Schlender</HL><DD> 01/28/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> HWPSTOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)HEARD ON THE STREET (HRD)COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   In the hot market for high-tech stocks these days, even the most guarded comments to securities analysts from one of Silicon Valley's most conservative executives can stir up a flurry of trading. Hewlett-Packard's president and chief executive officer, John A. Young, told a group of securities analysts in Palo Alto, Calif., yesterday that strong international orders for computer products pushed overall orders up 14% for November and December.    The orders numbers, plus the company's disclosure that it plans to buy back as much as $750 million of its shares, touched off a frenzy of trading. Though the shares went up only 1/8, to 49, 3.9 million of them changed hands at prices as high as 52. The stock was the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange.    Executives also said the company is &quot;making progress&quot; in solving development problems associated with the new business superminicomputer, called the HP3000 Series 930. They said the machine is meeting &quot;internal milestones toward its goal of beginning shipments in mid-1987.&quot;    Analysts said they generally believed the company was making progress on the new machine, based on the much-touted new technology, code named Spectrum, but warned that Hewlett-Packard was facing tight deadlines if it wanted to ensure a strong market entrance for the machines.    Kimball H. Brown, a market analyst who follows the company for Dataquest Inc., San Jose, Calif., said, &quot;The flat U.S. orders indicate that the domestic customers are still wary, which could mean that some of Hewlett-Packard's previously loyal customers&quot; might bolt to other manufacturers if the computer is delayed much longer.    Mr. Young said domestic orders for the two months were &quot;virtually unchanged&quot; from a year earlier, but that international orders rose 30% in the period. The strength of overseas orders reflects the experience of Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard's main competitor, but is in sharp contrast to the sluggish growth overseas experienced by industry leader International Business Machines Corp.    Palo Alto, Calif.-based Hewlett-Packard didn't predict in any greater detail its results for its first quarter ending Saturday, or for the current year. For fiscal 1986, it earned $516 million, or $2.02 a share, a 6% rise from the previous year. Revenue was $7.1 billion.    The company didn't specify the dollar amount of orders for November and December. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1986, which ended Oct. 31, international orders grew 40% to $882 million. International revenue in the quarter was $917 million, or about 47% of Hewlett-Packard's total revenue.    &quot;Hewlett-Packard has a heck of an installed base overseas, and it appears those customers have enough confidence that the company will ship&quot; its next generation of superminicomputers for businesses by mid-1987, as the company has promised, said Mr. Brown, the analyst.    Dean O. Morton, Hewlett-Packard's executive vice president and chief operating officer, said the customer site, or &quot;beta,&quot; testing of the new HP3000 Series 930 would begin this spring, but added that &quot;I don't want to minimize the amount of work that remains to be done.&quot;    Mr. Brown said: &quot;What I read into that statement is that they really are making progress and that they still intend to ship by midyear. If they slip behind that date by a month or two, it wouldn't hurt them too badly, but if it slips another six months, they'll have missed the window for the product. That's how critical things are.&quot;    He said that IBM and other large computer makers generally test new machines at customer beta sites for six months before shipping to customers.    The new computer is part of Hewlett-Packard's attempts to refit the internal architecture of its new computers to make them much more powerful. The Spectrum line has been under development for five years at a cost of more than $250 million, in what the company calls the largest project it has ever undertaken. Hewlett-Packard was able to ship the engineering version of the computer on schedule at the end of 1986, but the business machine has proven more nettlesome.    John C. Levinson, analyst for Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., said Mr. Morton's comments didn't amount to &quot;any change in the company's timetable&quot; for the Spectrum business computer. He added, &quot;There's no question that the hardware works. The engineering version runs like a bat out of hell, and the company made the comment today that sales of that system were exceeding expectations.&quot;    Mr. Levinson contended that &quot;all this emphasis on the Spectrum affecting the company's profitability is a bit overdone.&quot; The computer business accounts for just half of the company's $7.1 billion in revenue for the year ended Oct. 31, he said, &quot;and the Spectrum can't be a $1 billion-a-year revenue generator for several years yet.&quot;    Mr. Levinson said the company's decision to buy back as much as $750 million of its own shares also indicates &quot;some confidence from within&quot; that the company's profits and margins, and hence stock price, will improve in coming months.    At current prices, Hewlett-Packard could buy as many as 15.3 million of its shares, or about 6% of its 256 million shares outstanding. Hewlett-Packard's market capitalization currently stands at about $12.54 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
