In the two months since Britain put new securities laws -- the toughest in Europe -- into effect, its main enforcement agency has closed two companies that failed to meet the strict standards for operating an investment business. Officials may shut others as they plow through 4,000 remaining applications to do business.    The crackdown is a public-relations victory for the regulators, who say it illustrates how much better they can protect investors now that the Financial Services Act is in place. They are publicizing it to the hilt, even televising arrests on the evening news.    The targets so far are hardly London's biggest fish. One is a retail commodities dealer that managed #500,000 ($850,000). The other is a British-government-bond investment fund, Barlow Clowes, with an estimated #188 million ($320 million) under management. It is being liquidated because of allegedly inadequate financial controls that appear to have led to millions of pounds in losses.    But criticism is growing that Britain's new regulatory system amounts to overkill, especially for the global capital markets that are the bulk of Britain's financial-services industry. Costs of complying could exceed #100 million a year.    More ominously, Britain is boosting restrictions just when other European countries are knocking down barriers in anticipation of 1992, the European Community's target for removing remaining trade restrictions. Some analysts even suggest Britain's rules could cost London its role as Europe's leading financial center.    London's success is &quot;based on being lightly regulated. That is being turned around,&quot; says David Lomax, group economic adviser at National Westminster Bank PLC and author of a book on the law. &quot;The risk is, business will melt away.&quot; The outgoing chairman of London's stock exchange, Sir Nicholas Goodison, warned in a recent speech: &quot;As our competitors observe the regulatory burden being imposed here, they rub their hands in gleeful anticipation of business flowing from us toward them.&quot;    London is a big beneficiary of just that kind of migration. In the 1960s, it lured the Eurobond market because financiers here could operate with minimal governmental interference, unlike in the U.S. with its registration and tax requirements.    They can't any more. London-based bankers, securities executives and corporations are lobbying Britain's regulators to relax the new rules, which they complain are too costly and unwieldy. They are irate about new capital-adequacy requirements that force securities firms to pump at least 20% more capital into reserves. Nomura Securities Co. recently boosted its London unit's capitalization to #30 million from #2 million because of the rules, says Executive Director Keith Clarke.    Even normally quiescent Japanese bankers complained to the Bank of England about proposed higher capital requirements. &quot;Unless somebody gets their act together soon, business may go elsewhere,&quot; warns Peter Bulfield, chief executive of Yamaichi Bank Ltd., which wasn't among the complainers.    Much criticism is aimed at the system's complexity. Over 2,000 pages of rules provide work for more than 1,000 new compliance officers, says Mr. Lomax of NatWest. More than a dozen new regulatory and professional bodies oversee different types of businesses, and some financial-services conglomerates answer to several.    &quot;There's an astounding amount of paperwork,&quot; says James Scanlon, senior vice president and general manager of Irving Trust Co. here. Irving now has two staffers working full-time on compliance.    Because of various &quot;know-your-client&quot; rules, brokers require clients to complete a multipage questionnaire about assets, investment goals and appetite for risk. &quot;Must We Really Reveal These Personal Details?&quot; asked London's Daily Mail newspaper last week, recounting the story of a father asked to complete a form when he tried to open a savings account for his five-year-old daughter.    Part of the problem is that the system is untested. Britain is attempting to cover ground the U.S. still wrestles with some 50 years after enacting its securities laws. In their haste, British regulators haven't thoroughly considered the ramifications of their actions, critics say.    For example, because anyone conducting investment or finance business in Britain now must register with British regulators, even U.S. insurance companies must secure permission to sell policies to American servicemen here.    The rules also cover such multinationals as British Petroleum Co. and Unilever PLC, which must register to continue many internal financial operations. These multinationals only benefit from new legal protections if they sue themselves. The rules &quot;add to costs without doing anything for their bottom lines,&quot; says Gerald Leahy, a former Unilever treasurer and recent president of Britain's Association of Corporate Treasurers, which wants changes.    So far, no one is grabbing the first Concorde out. Banks and securities houses aren't anxious to write off the billions of dollars they spent here to gear up for global markets. The English language, modern technology and good restaurants are unchanging attractions.    But as pressure grows on profit margins, financial companies seek to limit exposure to this new regulation. &quot;A number of firms say to me they can simply book business elsewhere,&quot; says Sir Nicholas.    London's biggest threat comes from Continental Europe. Preparing for its 1992 deadline, the EC recently agreed to drop barriers to cross-border capital flows. Proposals would allow European financial institutions to set up shop anywhere in the 12-nation bloc, deferring regulation to home-country authorities.    None has rules as comprehensive as Britain's. Some, like Luxembourg, already are attracting business from London, says Cento Veljanovski, research and editorial director of London's Institute of Economic Affairs. Meantime, Spain, the Netherlands and France are deregulating financial markets to make them more alluring, though France's stock-market scandal raises the specter of harsher rules there.    The British government is aware of the dangers. It recently tapped Bank of England official David Walker to head the Securities and Investments Board, a signal to some of London's financial bigwigs of more reasonable regulation. It is reviewing the law, and may seek amendments. It also is pressing the EC to bring regulations up to London's standards. </TEXT></DOC>
