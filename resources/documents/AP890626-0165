A tugboat was capsized, a barge was driven aground and roofs weredamaged.   Landfall came near Freeport, about 60 miles south of Houston,with the storm packing a sustained wind speed of 50 mph and weatherforecasters predicting as much as 15 inches of rain in the next 24hours.   The National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla., saidtropical storm-force wind extended as far as 150 miles to the eastof the center of the storm. Little change in the storm's strengthwas expected Monday.   A tropical storm warning was in effect from Freeport to MorganCity, La.   Allison had been a slow-moving tropical depression but wasupgraded to a tropical storm Monday morning after its sustained windspeed reached 39 mph.   ``It has a poorly defined center,'' weather service meteorologistLarry Vannozzi said. ``There probably will be some minor winddamage. The main thing is the rain. It's a heavy rainmaker.''   Forecasters warned that 10 to 15 inches of rain was possible overeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana as large bands of rainmoved onshore.   The heavy rain prompted the weather service to issue a flashflood watch for much of the southeastern Texas coast and a flashflood warning for Brazoria and Galveston counties, south of Houston,and parts of Harris County.   Some areas of Brazoria County had received more than 10 inches ofrain in the previous couple of days, and that amount also wasexpected for parts of Houston, weather service meteorologist ErnestChapa said.   ``It should weaken after it goes ashore, but it'll take awhile,'' Chapa said.   The storm was blamed for capsizing a tugboat in Galveston Bay andsending a benzene-bearing barge aground in the Houston Ship Channel.Three people escaped serious injury and the barge was not believedto be damaged, Coast Guard spokesman Mark Kennedy said.   ``It may be able to ride out the storm aground,'' Kennedy said.``These are fairly soft and sandy bars and reefs so maybe it won'tbe a problem.''   Tides ranged from 3 to 5 feet above normal, Chapa said.   In Galveston, the rain and high tides pushed Highland Bayou outof its banks along a highway, submerging cars in more than 4 feet ofwater.   On Galveston Island, some residents with beach homes on the westend reported a foot of water in their yards, weather servicespecialist Debbie Cage said. A torn-off roof and a damaged garagewere possibly caused by a tornado, Ms. Cage said.   In Brazoria County, residents in the small island community ofQuintana Beach were advised to evacuate because rising waterthreatened to close the area's swing bridge.   ``We're telling them if they want to get out, they'd better getout now,'' Chief Deputy Charles Wagner said of the Brazoria CountySheriff's Department.   Brazoria County Emergency Management Coordinator Jack McCann alsoadvised residents of low-lying areas to seek higher ground.   The weather service reported some roads were closed in theKemah-Seabrook area and near the Houston Ship Channel, which wasclosed by tides 5 feet above mean sea level. Some roads in the TexasCity and Dickinson area, north of Galveston, also were closed byhigh water, as were some Houston-area freeway feeder roads.   Houston Lighting andamp; Power Co. reported 30,000 customers werewithout electricity. The University of Houston at Clear Lake wasamong several schools to cancel Monday night classes.   The storm had its origins in Hurricane Cosme, which moved fromthe Pacific Ocean across Mexico last week.</TEXT></DOC>
