The Service, Department of the Interior, proposes to establish a NationalWildlife Refuge in the Bear River valley immediately south of the townof Cokeville, Wyoming, for the purpose of protecting the wet meadowland/riveroxbow wetland complex that exists there. The area supports excellent breedingpopulations of redhead ducks, sandhill cranes, Canada geese and numerousother populations of ducks, marshbirds, and shorebirds. These wetlandsare the largest representative complex of this type in Wyoming and arethreatened by incompatable agricultural practices, drainage of oxbows,and potential oil and gas development. The principal identified alternatives are: 1. No Action_Area would remain as is. No acquisition by the Service. 2. Acquisition/Management By Others_State, Bureau of Land Management, andconservation groups. 3. Protection by existing local, State and federal regulations. 4. Less-Than-Fee Acquisition_Wetland Easements and Management Agreements.5. Fee Purchase_All lands acquired within boundary in fee title by theService. 6. Combination of Alternatives_Preferred alternative by the Service. Wouldinvolve fee purchase of 22,961 acres in northern end of project area and3,696 acres in wetland easements in southern end of project area. The concept of protecting habitat on the Bear River near Cokeville, Wyoming,was first identified in 1978 by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (Department)and the Service. The Service reviewed the area in 1980 and the Departmentcompleted a study of the area in 1984. In July 1987, the Service receivedthe conditional support of the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission and theLincoln County Commission to proceed with a refuge proposal. In order to acquire lands with Migratory Bird Conservation Fund monies,it is necessary to have enabling legislation and the consent of the governorof the State in which the refuge is proposed. After a public meeting inCokeville in November 1987, a bill to authorize the Service to purchaseland for a refuge was introduced in the Wyoming Legislature. The bill wasdisapproved in February 1988. In response to the Legislature and residents of the Cokeville area, theService prepared a Development and Management Plan for the Bear ValleyWetlands Proposal. The Management Plan responded to the major questionsregarding refuge development, water management, upland management, recreationaluse, and other issues. Concurrent with release of the Management Plan,the Service held public informational sessions in Cokeville, Evanston,Kemmerer and Casper, Wyoming, and in Randolph, Utah. A formal Public Hearingwas held in Cokeville in November 1988 on the refuge proposal and ManagementPlan. Subsequently, legislation was again introduced in the Wyoming Legislatureand was passed. The signed bill (Senate Enrolled Act No. 22) was submittedto Governor Sullivan, who supported the legislative action but did notsign the Act. The Act became effective without signature. The enabling legislation imposes certain stipulations on the Service intheir refuge proposal. The area of consideration for protection is restrictedto a 27,000-acre area on either side of the Bear River immediately southof the town of Cokeville. Acquisition would be from willing sellers only.No condemnation would be permitted except in quiet title actions. The Servicemust enter into an agreement with the State for water use and management.The major impacts of the proposal that can be perceived are: <ITAG tagnum="15">_Perpetual protection of the area for wildlife and wetland values.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Loss of land ownership by the private sector.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Gradual shift for community to recreation-oriented economy. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Major expenditure of public monies for acquisition and development.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Enhanced waterfowl and other wildlife populations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Increased tourism and public use benefits in Lincoln County. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Decline in the amount of unregulated rangeland for cattle industry.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Unified water management program for the area. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Long-term socioeconomic impacts on the region. </ITAG>The environmental review of this project will be conducted in accordancewith the requirements of the NEPA of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4371 etseq.), NEPA Regulations (40 CFR 1500-1508), other appropriate federal regulations,and Service procedures for compliance with those regulations. We estimate the draft EIS will be made available to the public by lateJune, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 31, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Galen L.
