Temperatures hit record lows in more than two dozen cities inIowa, Kansas, North and South Dakota, Michigan, Oklahoma, Nebraska,Missouri, and Illinois, and the wind chill effect at Moline, Ill.,was 49 degrees below zero.   The official low for the lower 48 states was 30 degrees belowzero at Chadron, Neb., and at 2 p.m. the temperature at Lemmon,S.D., was still only 11 below zero, the National Weather Servicesaid.   ``We're draining all the cold weather out of Alaska, theNorthwest Territories and northern Canada,'' said National WeatherService forecaster James Vermoch in Chicago. ``We're bringing itright down the pipe.''   Up to 30 inches of snow fell in northeastern Wisconsin's DoorCounty in two days, with 25 inches in the same period aroundSheridan, Wyo.   Generally 3 to 6 inches fell during the night and through Fridayfrom Kansas to West Virginia, with storm watches posted intoSaturday in the Northeast. And snow had begun falling fromsouthwestern New York state to North Carolina and Tennessee. Inaddition to the heavy snow at Sheridan, Wyo., lesser amounts fellelsewhere in that state and up to 18 inches fell in the ColoradoRockies.   Schools were closed Friday in parts of Wyoming, Kansas,Missouri, Nebraska, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Kentuckyand West Virginia. One Iowa school closed for lack of heat.   Numerous school, business, social and sporting events werecanceled.   Two deaths were blamed on the snow and slippery roads in Indiana.   Authorities at the Wheeling-Ohio County Airport in WestVirginia's Northern Panhandle had planned to dedicate $170,000 insnow removal equipment Friday, but that had to be postponed, saidAirport Manager Thomas Tominack.   ``Actually, the equipment is currently being utilized to cleanthe runways and we can't really take the time to have thededications,'' Tominack said. ``Priorities are such that we need toget our runways clean.''   Plunging temperatures and surface freezing on roads promptedKentucky's government to shut down at mid-morning Friday, sendingthousands of state employees home.   Greater Cincinnati International Airport closed for an hour topermit removal of snow from the runway. Delta Air Lines canceled 12flights there.   Gusty north wind and the cold broke power lines in Kansas,blacking out more than 3,000 customers for a time in parts ofWichita and Leavenworth, utility officials said.   That wind also created wind chill effect readings across Kansasfrom 25 below zero to 45 below.   Record lows included 26 below zero at Dickinson, N.D.; 19 belowat Dubuque, Iowa; 16 below at Burlington and Carroll, Iowa andConcordia, Kan. The low of 15 below at Salina, Kan., bettered arecord that had been on the books since 1901.   Farther north, chronically cold International Falls, Minn., onthe Canadian border, had a low of 18 below zero.   Up to 6 inches of snow in the Cincinnati area brought much ofthe morning rush hour traffic to a halt. Across the Ohio River,Interstate 71-75 at Covington, Ky., was closed in both directionswhile crews attempted to clear the most dangerous, hilly stretch ofhighway. Many people whose cars stalled or ran out of gas duringthe up to two-hour delay abandoned their cars at the roadside.   Slippery pavement in Brooklyn Center, Minn., a Minneapolissuburb, led to a 20-car pileup Friday on Interstate 94. One minorinjury was reported.   Ski resort operators generally welcome snow, but heavy snow inWyoming's Big Horn Mountains prevented the Antelope Butte skiresort from opening this weekend as planned, according to theresort's owners.   As of Thursday morning, 30 inches of snow had been dumped on theresort in north-central Wyoming, and that closed roads to theresort, Allison Scott said Thursday.   But the equally heavy snow on flatter terrain in Wisconsin'sDoor County, a peninsula jutting into Lake Michigan, was welcomed.   ``There is enough snow in the county to provide every man, womanand child with at least 100 snowballs,'' said Wally Blevins,executive vice president of the Door County Chamber of Commerce.</TEXT></DOC>
