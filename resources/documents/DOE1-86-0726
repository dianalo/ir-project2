On the basis of dataof analysis using the methods of gas-liquid chromatography and UV spectroscopyit has been ascertained that in most cases the interaction proceeds withsolvent molecule participation. Mechanism of reaction, including thestage of monoelectron oxidation of dinitromethyl compound anion by XeF/sub2/ molecules to dinitromethyl radical, is suggested.</TEXT></DOC>
