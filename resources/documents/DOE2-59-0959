Inthis study, a water solution of metal acetates was concentrated to generatea sol-state body. From, this sol, gel fibers were drawn. These gel fiberswere then heated to generate YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O/sub 7-x/ superconductingfibers, which measured 5 micrometers - 2mm in diameter and more than50 cm in length. Heating the fibers caused them to become hollow. Atthe heating temperature of 950{sup 0}C, the critical temperature roseto 73K. Also, by using triethanolamine to dissolve copper alkoxide, whichis insoluble in alcohol, the alkoxide solution was dried to form a gelfilm, and heated to 800{sup 0}C. This process produced a YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub3}O/sub 7-x/ superconducting coating film. The 1.5-micrometer-thick film,consisting of crystal particles measuring 1 to 2 micrometers in diameter,showed a superconducting transition of Tc (end) = 56K. (7 figs, 1 tab,8 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
