The      calculated purity is preferably corrected for variations in temperature      and pressure. The method requires the determination and use of an      appropriate fan constant based on the gas whose purity is to be measured      and specific to the fan being used to circulate the gas mixture and the      speed at which it operates. An appropriate adjustment factor for      differences between design and measured speed may also be applied in      accordance with the fan laws. The method can provide real time measurement      of hydrogen gas purity in the cooling gas circulated inside a large      synchronous AC generator and utilizing a microprocessor to provide a real      time output of hydrogen gas purity. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION </PAC><PAR>  This application is related to U.S. Pat. No. 5,088,315 issued Feb. 18, 1992      to Walter A. Johnson for Gas Purity Analyzer and Method. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention pertains to the determination of the purity of a gas      in a gas mixture and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for      determining the purity of a first gas in a binary mixture with another      known gas which mixture is being circulated in a closed system by a fan. </PAR><PAR>  Binary mixtures of two gases are often utilized in various kinds of closed      systems, for example, to process certain materials therein or to provide a      medium for heat transfer. As an example of the latter, a mixture of      hydrogen gas and air is often used to cool large AC generators by      circulating the gas mixture within the generator housing. Hydrogen, in      particular, has a very high thermal conductivity which makes it possible      to run large generators at higher loads because the circulating hydrogen      provides better removal of heat from the generator windings. The thermal      conductivity of hydrogen is six to seven times greater than air and,      therefore, as high a percentage of hydrogen as practical in the cooling      gas mixture is most desirable. </PAR><PAR>  Because of the highly combustible nature of hydrogen, the volume percent or      purity of hydrogen in the mixture must also be maintained relatively high.      It is desirable in this heat transfer application to maintain the purity      of hydrogen in the mixture above 90% and, more typically, above a minimum      of 95%. Obviously, because of the practical impossibility of obtaining      pure hydrogen gas and the presence of normal system leakage, a pure      hydrogen atmosphere cannot be maintained. Nevertheless, hydrogen purities      as high as 98% to 99% are fairly readily attainable. </PAR><PAR>  It is also necessary, in order to take best advantage of the high thermal      conductivity of hydrogen to maintain an adequate pressure within the      system. In a large AC generator, for example, operation at full load      requires the maintenance of a system pressure up to about 75 psi. Typical      hydrogen leakage through the generator shaft seals or by absorption in the      lubricating oil requires the regular addition of makeup hydrogen, both to      maintain system pressure and to maintain hydrogen purity at a safe high      level. </PAR><PAR>  Because of the potential hazards which are attendant a reduction in      hydrogen purity below safe, non-combustible levels, appropriate purity      monitoring and alarm systems must be utilized. The primary means of      monitoring hydrogen purity in the cooling gas mixture inside a large AC      generator is by the use of a thermal gas analyzer. Because the relative      conductivity of hydrogen is so much greater than the air or other gas      impurity with which it is typically mixed, thermal conductivity is an      excellent indicator of hydrogen purity. Thus, a thermal gas analyzer is      typically used to continuously monitor hydrogen purity and to provide an      appropriate alarm if the purity drops below established safe levels.      However, typical thermal gas analyzers have a notoriously slow response      time and it is not unusual for the output of a thermal gas analyzer to lag      an actual system change in hydrogen purity by as much as one hour.      Obviously, the alarm signal will also lag correspondingly the actual alarm      condition. In addition, a typical thermal gas analyzer requires the use of      a dryer in the sample feedline to remove moisture from the gas sample      prior to analysis. With water vapor removed from the air/hydrogen sample      being analyzed, the sample is not actually representative of the gas      mixture used in the generator cooling system. </PAR><PAR>  An independent back-up means of determining hydrogen purity is typically      provided by the use of a direct reading manometer calibrated to give a      rough indication of hydrogen purity in the generator. The manometer is      calibrated empirically based on measured gas purities at various measured      machine pressures. A typical large generator includes two shaft-mounted      fans inside the housing to circulate the cooling hydrogen/air mixture.      Differential fan pressure is monitored directly with the appropriately      calibrated manometer which also provides a much more rapid response to      changes in hydrogen purity than does a thermal gas analyzer. However, a      manometer provides only a rough indication of hydrogen purity and is      typically difficult to read accurately. Moreover, a manometer cannot be      readily connected to be read or monitored at a remote location nor can it      be easily adapted to be connected to an alarm system. </PAR><PAR>  There is, therefore, a need for a method and apparatus for determining the      purity of one gas in a known binary gas mixture which is accurate and      operates on an essentially real time basis. In particular, it would be      desirable to have a method and means for accurately and rapidly monitoring      hydrogen purity in the coolant gas mixture circulating within a large      generator or the like. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In accordance with the present invention, the purity of a first gas in a      binary mixture of that first gas and a known second gas may be      continuously monitored and measured on a real time basis where the mixture      is being circulated in a closed system by a fan. The method finds      particular application for the continuous monitoring and measurement of      hydrogen gas purity in a hydrogen/air mixture comprising a cooling gas      circulated in the housing of a large electric generator. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with the method of the present invention, a first      differential pressure across the fan is determined with the fan operating      at a first speed and with said first gas at essentially 100% purity in the      system. This first fan differential pressure provides a fan constant which      is unique to the fan operating at the speed at which the constant is      determined. To determine the purity of the first gas in any other mixture      with a second gas, a second differential pressure across the fan is      measured and the direct equality between the ratios of said first and      second fan differential pressures and the densities of said first gas and      the gas mixture (or the molecular weights of the first gas and the gas      mixture) can be utilized to calculate the volume percent purity of the      first gas directly. Appropriate adjustments can be made to correct the      first gas purity calculation, if necessary, for variations in system      pressure and temperature, in accordance with the ideal gas law. In      addition, the known relationship between system pressure and fan speed,      pursuant to the fan laws, may be utilized to correct the calculated first      gas purity for differences in fan speed. </PAR><PAR>  The first fan differential pressure at 100% purity of the first gas, also      hereinafter referred to as the fan constant, may be measured directly or      may be calculated on the basis of the foregoing ratios. In a preferred      embodiment, the first fan differential pressure is determined by measuring      the actual fan differential pressure with the system containing any      mixture of said first and second gases, measuring the actual volume      percent purity of the first gas in that mixture (as with a conventional      thermal gas analyzer), and then calculating said first fan differential      pressure in accordance with the same proportional relationships previously      mentioned. If the fan constant represented by the first fan differential      pressure is calculated in this manner, it is preferable to establish the      constant at a standard pressure and temperature level. For example, the      constant may be set at zero system gage pressure and a standard      temperature representative of normal operating temperature levels. Then,      when the second fan differential pressure is measured for the purpose of      determining the purity of the first gas in any other mixture with the      known second gas, measured system pressure and temperature at the second      fan differential pressure may be used to easily correct the calculated      purity in accordance with the ideal gas laws. </PAR><PAR>  All of the measured variables are readily measurable in a typical      hydrogen-cooled AC generator and the monitoring of hydrogen gas purity is      readily adaptable to microprocessor control. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a vertical cross section through the axis of a hydrogen-cooled      synchronous AC generator for which the method of the present invention is      particularly adapted. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of a closed gas circulation system      showing the various measured values used to calculate the purity of one of      the gases in the circulating binary gas mixture. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  Referring first of FIG. 1, a typical large synchronous AC generator 10,      includes a main shaft 12 rotatably mounting a rotor 11 by its opposite      ends in a pair of main bearings 13. The stator 14 surrounds the rotor 11      and is mounted in a fixed position with respect thereto in an enclosing      housing 15. </PAR><PAR>  Hydrogen gas is supplied to the interior of the housing 15 from an external      hydrogen supply 16 and is distributed within the housing by a hydrogen gas      header 17. The hydrogen header 17 is separated from the rotor 11 and      stator 14 by an interior cooling chamber wall 18 dividing the interior of      the housing 15 into a cooling chamber 20 and a supply chamber 21. The      opposite axial end walls of the cooling chamber wall 18 include circular      openings which surround the main shaft 12 and within which are disposed a      pair of shaft-mounted gas circulation fans 23. The fans 23 rotate with the      main shaft and the generator rotor 11 to circulate hydrogen gas from the      supply chamber 21 into and through the cooling chamber 20, to carry heat      from the rotor and stator, and to return the gas to the supply chamber via      outlet openings 24 in the outer radial walls of the cooling chamber 20.      Passive heat transfer devices in the supply chamber 21 remove heat from      the hydrogen gas which is recirculated in the closed system back through      the cooling chamber 20. </PAR><PAR>  The hydrogen gas is maintained at a very high purity in the range of 95% to      99andplus;% subject to slight dilution by air which unavoidably seeps into the      system. The high volume percent purity of hydrogen in the cooling gas      mixture is desirable because of the very much greater thermal conductivity      of hydrogen as compared to air and because at high hydrogen purity the      mixture is nonexplosive and will not support combustion. </PAR><PAR>  Increasing the hydrogen concentration by increasing the system pressure      also enhances heat transfer and allows a generator to be operated at      higher loads. Typically, a system pressure of 60 psi is maintained on a      large synchronous AC generator operating at 3600 RPM and full load.      Because of the importance of high hydrogen gas purity in the mixture to      provide both effective cooling and a non-combustible mixture, hydrogen      purity within the generator housing must be continuously monitored and      maintained within the indicated safe range. Suitable alarm systems are      typically provided so that hydrogen gas from the external supply 16 may be      added whenever the hydrogen purity and/or the system pressure within the      housing 15 drop below threshold levels. Hydrogen loss typically is a      result of normal leakage through the seals and the absorption of hydrogen      by lubricating oil. </PAR><PAR>  Typical prior art hydrogen purity monitoring devices utilize the high      thermal conductivity of hydrogen versus air as an indicator of hydrogen      purity because the mixture of air or virtually any other gas with hydrogen      will produce a substantially lower thermal conductivity than pure or high      purity hydrogen gas. However, as indicated previously, thermal gas      analyzers require a complex sampling and operating system, including a      dryer to remove water vapor from the hydrogen/air mixture before sampling,      and are typically very slow to react to changes in hydrogen purity. </PAR><PAR>  It has long been known that differential fan pressure across the fans 23 is      proportional to the density of the gas being circulated and, with an      air/hydrogen mixture, differential fan pressure can be utilized as an      indication of the purity of the hydrogen in the hydrogen/air mixture.      Differential fan pressure is utilized to operate a manometer calibrated to      show hydrogen purity directly. However, such a manometer is typically      difficult to read and is used only as a backup to provide a rough      independent check on the thermal gas analyzer. </PAR><PAR>  A typical synchronous AC generator 10 includes or may be readily modified      to provide for the measurement of differential pressure across the cooling      gas circulating fans 23 system gas pressure within the housing (typically      taken upstream of the fans in the supply chamber 21), and the temperature      of the cooling gas within the housing (which may be taken at a place to      provide a typical gas temperature or at several locations which may be      arithmetically averaged). The method of the present invention is also      dependent on fan speed, however, this is typically not a factor in the      application of the method to a synchronous generator which operates at a      constant carefully controlled speed. The various measured variables are      shown schematically in FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  The method of the present invention utilizes the various measured      conditions within the generator housing, identified above, as well as a      fan differential pressure factor which is constant for a given fan      operating at a constant speed, and the proportional relationships between      fan differential pressure and gas density (or molecular weight) to      calculate the purity of hydrogen gas directly. The calculation can be made      with the use of a microprocessor such that continuous, real time      monitoring of hydrogen purity is attainable. </PAR><PAR>  The fundamental relationship upon which the method of the present invention      is based may be expressed by the following equation: </PAR><EQU>  dP.sub.M /dP.sub.l andequals;D.sub.M /D.sub.l                       (1) </EQU><PAR>  Equation (1) expresses the known relationship based on conventional fan      laws that, in a fan running at a constant speed, the ratio of the fan      differential pressures for two different gases is equal to the ratio of      their respective densities. In particular, the ratio of the fan      differential pressure circulating a gas mixture, dP.sub.M, and the fan      differential pressure circulating a pure gas, dP.sub.l, is equal to the      ratio of the density of the binary gas mixture D.sub.M to the density of      the pure gas D.sub.l. In the example of the preferred embodiment of the      present invention, the binary mixture is air and hydrogen and the gas of      interest is hydrogen. Hydrogen and air both obey the ideal gas laws, as      applied in the manner hereinafter described. </PAR><PAR>  The fan differential pressure factor or fan constant, forming the basis of      the gas purity calculation pursuant to the present invention, is a measure      of the fan differential pressure at a known fan speed, pressure and      temperature, utilizing a known gas at 100% purity. Because hydrogen is the      gas of interest and its purity is monitored on a continuing basis, the fan      differential pressure factor (fan constant) is determined for hydrogen gas      at 100% purity in the system. The factor can be measured or calculated, as      will be indicated hereinafter, and is used in conjunction with measured      fan differential pressure, system pressure and temperature of any other      mixture of air and hydrogen to determine the hydrogen purity in that      mixture. Referring to equation (1) above, the fan differential pressure or      fan constant, dP.sub.l, may be determined by measuring the actual fan      differential pressure directly with the system containing the gas of      interest (hydrogen) at essentially 100% purity, or calculated by measuring      the foregoing variables utilizing a known gas purity. For example, the      purity of hydrogen in the system may be measured directly, as with a      thermal gas analyzer. In any case, it is desirable for the sake of      convenience to calculate or correct the fan constant to zero system      pressure (atmospheric pressure) and a standard or typical operating      temperature (e.g. 95.degree. F.). </PAR><PAR>  The purity of hydrogen gas (or other gas of interest in a mixture) to be      determined in accordance with the method of the present invention, may be      expressed in terms of the density of the gas mixture, D.sub.M in equation      (1) by utilizing the relationship of the densities of the component gases      in the mixture to the density of the mixture, pursuant to the following      equation: </PAR><EQU>  D.sub.M andequals;D.sub.l (X)andplus;D.sub.2 (1-X)                         (2) </EQU><PAR>  In equation (2), D.sub.M and D.sub.l are as indicated in equation (1),      D.sub.2 is the density of air (or other gas in the binary mixture), and X      is the volume percent purity of hydrogen (or other gas of interest)      expressed as a decimal fraction. The right hand side of equation (2) may      be substituted for D.sub.M in equation (1), and the densities of hydrogen      and air at any common temperature and pressure inserted therein for      D.sub.1 and D.sub.2, respectively, as shown in the following equation: </PAR><EQU>  dP.sub.M /dP.sub.l andequals;andlsqb;Dhd l(X)andplus;D.sub.2 (1-X)andrsqb;/D.sub.l       (3) </EQU><PAR>  However, in accordance with the universal gas laws, the density D of any      ideal gas may be expressed in terms of its molecular weight w in      accordance with the following equation: </PAR><EQU>  Dandequals;wP/RT                                                    (4) </EQU><PAR>  In equation (4) P and T are the pressure and temperature at which density      is determined and R is the universal gas constant. However, with respect      to the density of the air/hydrogen mixture, D.sub.M, as expressed in terms      of the densities of its components, D.sub.l and D.sub.2, the factor P/RT      from equation (4) is a constant and, therefore, the right side of equation      (3) may be expressed as follows: </PAR><EQU>  dP.sub.M /dP.sub.l andequals;andlsqb;w.sub.1 (X)andplus;w.sub.2 (1-X)andrsqb;/w.sub.l,   (5) </EQU><PAL>  where w.sub.1 and w.sub.2 are the molecular weights of hydrogen and air,      respectively. As indicated above, dP.sub.1 is the fan constant or fan      differential pressure factor for hydrogen gas (at a selected pressure and      temperature) and dP.sub.M is the measured differential fan pressure in the      system operating with the gas mixture and at which pressure it is desired      to determine the purity, X, of the hydrogen gas. </PAL><PAR>  Thus, dP.sub.l is measured or calculated in advance, dP.sub.M is measured      at the time a purity determination is to be made, the molecular weights of      hydrogen and air, w.sub.1 and w.sub.2, are known, and equation (5) can be      solved for hydrogen purity, X. Because the differential pressures are      affected by system temperature and pressure, appropriate corrections must      be made for differences in temperature and pressure at which the      respective differential pressures, dP.sub.l and dP.sub.M are calculated      and/or measured, as shown in the following corrected version of equation      (5): </PAR><EQU>  andlsqb;dP.sub.M (t.sub.M /P.sub.M)andrsqb;/andlsqb;dP.sub.l (t.sub.l /P.sub.l)andrsqb;andequals;andlsqb;w.sub.l      (X)andplus;w.sub.2 (1-X)andrsqb;/w.sub.l                                (6) </EQU><PAL>  or </PAL><EQU>  andlsqb;dP.sub.M (t.sub.M)(P.sub.l)andrsqb;/andlsqb;dP.sub.l (t.sub.l)(P.sub.M)andrsqb;andequals;andlsqb;w.sub.l      (X)andplus;w.sub.2 (1-X)andrsqb;/w.sub.l                                (7) </EQU><PAR>  In equations (6) and (7), t.sub.l and P.sub.l are, respectively, the      temperature in degrees R and system pressure at which the fan differential      pressure factor was determined, which may conveniently be selected as, for      example, 95.degree. F. (555.degree. R) and atmospheric pressure (zero      system pressure) of 14.7 psi. t.sub.M and P.sub.M are, respectively, the      actual temperature of the gas and the actual system gas pressure at the      time the differential fan pressure, dP.sub.M is measured for the gas      mixture the purity of the hydrogen component of which it is desired to      determine. Thus, equation (6) or (7) is solved for the hydrogen purity, X,      expressed as a decimal fraction. The system pressure P.sub.M (psia)      comprises the measured gage pressure (psia), plus atmospheric pressure. </PAR><PAR>  In the presently preferred method for determining the fan constant dP.sub.l      which, as indicated above, is the fan differential pressure for the pure      gas (i.e. hydrogen) at a given speed, system pressure and gas temperature,      the following procedure is used. The actual differential fan pressure in a      system circulating the binary gas mixture is measured, along with the gas      temperature and system pressure. This provides the variables dP.sub.M,      t.sub.M and P.sub.M. The molecular weights of the component gases w.sub.l      (hydrogen) and w.sub.2 (air) are known and the temperature and pressure,      t.sub.l and P.sub.l, may be selected at any desired level, as indicated.      The purity of the hydrogen gas in that mixture is then measured (as with a      thermal gas analyzer), and the purity value X inserted in the equation (6)      or (7). The equation is then solved for dP.sub.l, the fan constant or fan      differential pressure factor. Once determined, this factor, along with the      selected temperature and pressure t.sub.l and P.sub.l may be used to      calculate the hydrogen gas purity at any other conditions of fan      differential pressure, dP.sub.M, temperature, t.sub.M, and system      pressure, P.sub.M, so long as the fan speed remains constant. </PAR><PAR>  The following is an example of a manner in which equation (7) could be      solved to determine the volume percent purity of hydrogen X. First, the      fan constant dP.sub.1 is determined in accordance with the procedure set      forth in the foregoing paragraph. As indicated, dP.sub.1 is the fan      differential pressure in the cooling system circulating pure hydrogen gas      and operating at a given speed, system pressure and gas temperature. In      this example, for a large syncronous AC generator operating at a constant      3600 RPM, DP.sub.1 equals 1.6 inches of water. The temperature t.sub.1 and      pressure P.sub.1 at which dP.sub.1 was calculated were set at 555.degree.      R and 14.7 psia, respectively. The known molecular weights of hydrogen      W.sub.1 and air W.sub.2 are 2.016 and 28.97, respectively. Substituting      the foregoing values into equation (7) results in the following:      ##EQU1## </PAR><PAR>  Solving this equation for X results in a decimal fraction, also known as      &quot;mole fraction&quot;. To convert to percent, both sides are multiplied by 100      as follows:      ##EQU2## </PAR><PAR>  Equation (10) can be converted to the following general equation form:      ##EQU3## </PAR><PAR>  As long as the generator speed remains at a constant 3600 RPM, the speed      correction set forth in equation (8), below, is unitary and does not      affect equation (11). However, to compensate for variations in sped,      equation (8) may be incorporated into equation (11) as follows:      ##EQU4## </PAR><PAR>  Fan constant dP.sub.l could also be measured directly in a system operating      at 100% purity of the first gas of interest. This measured differential      fan pressure could be adjusted, if desired, to atmospheric pressure and a      standard temperature, as previously indicated. Another method for      determining dP.sub.l would utilize actual measured differential fan      pressure with the other gas of the mixture at 100% purity, and      back-calculating dP.sub.l in accordance with the relationship set forth      hereinabove. </PAR><PAR>  In the application of the method of the present invention to calculating      and monitoring hydrogen purity in the cooling gas circulated inside a      large synchronous AC generator, certain unique factors exist which affect      the accuracy needed in determining measured conditions and the detail      needed in providing results which are accurate and meaningful. When the      generator is operating at full load, the gas temperature rarely varies by      more than about 5.degree. F. Therefore, with the temperatures t.sub.l and      t.sub.M expressed in degrees R, and a reference temperature t.sub.l      selected at about the normal level of operating temperature, there is      likely to be very little difference between the two temperatures. In other      words, a 5.degree. variation at 500.degree. R. or higher only varies the      ratio of t.sub.M to t.sub.l by 1% or less. Under certain circumstances, it      may be possible to exclude temperature compensation from the calculation      of hydrogen purity without a significant decrease in accuracy. In these      systems, it is also desirable to maintain a fairly high and constant      system pressure P, at a level for example of about 60 psig. Thus, if the      actual system pressure is maintained fairly constant and the fan constant,      dP.sub.l, is calculated at that pressure, the system pressure ratio might      also be omitted from the calculation of hydrogen purity without      substantially affecting accuracy. However, because the actual variations      in system pressure as a percentage of the base or reference pressure      P.sub.l are typically much larger than corresponding differences in      temperature, it is preferred to continuously monitor and measure system      pressure and use it in the calculation of hydrogen purity. Also, since the      speed of a generator must be maintained constant when on-line, there is      typically no need to compensate for differences in speed between the speed      at which the fan constant was determined and the speed at which the fan      differential pressure is measured for hydrogen purity determination.      However, it may be desirable in certain circumstances to be able to      continue to monitor hydrogen purity as a generator is being brought on or      taken off-line such that the speed may be constantly increasing or      decreasing. In accordance with the fan laws, the system or differential      fan pressure varies directly with the square of the fan speed. If the      ratio of the fan speed at which the fan constant dP.sub.l was determined      and the fan speed at which the differential fan pressure circulating the      gas mixture for purity determination was measured is relatively small,      i.e. less than 3, a correction factor may be applied to equation (6) or      (7) to correct for speed variations, as follows: </PAR><EQU>  (RPM.sub.l /RPM.sub.M).sup.2,                              (8) </EQU><PAL>  where RPM.sub.l is the speed at which the fan constant is determined and      RPM.sub.M is the fan speed at which the hydrogen purity determination is      made. The correction factor is applied by multiplying the measured fan      differential pressure, dP.sub.M, by the factor, e.g. the left hand side of      equation (7). </PAL><PAR>  A microprocessor may be appropriately programmed and connected to a      generator to provide continuing real time calculations of hydrogen purity.      Each of the measured conditions, fan differential pressure, system gas      pressure and gas temperature can be continuously measured, converted to      appropriate digital signals and supplied to a microprocessor for purity      calculations as described hereinabove. Generator speed could also be      continuously monitored and an appropriate speed signal provided to the      microprocessor to calculate and apply the speed correction factor (8)      should any variation in speed occur. It is also possible to utilize analog      outputs of the various measured conditions to provide a direct reading      analog output of hydrogen (or other gas) purity. However, digital      processing is far simpler and is the presently preferred method. </PAR><PAR>  The method of the present invention may also be used to determine the      purity of one gas in a binary mixture of two known gases inside a housing      where there is no internal gas circulating fan, as in the case of a      generator. In that situation, a small fan could be placed in a duct system      which is connected to the housing to draw gas out of it, circulate it      through the fan, and return it to the housing through the other end of the      duct. Differential pressure across the fan, as well as system gas pressure      and temperature, could all be measured in the same manner shown in FIG. 2.      The fan constant or fan differential pressure factor dP.sub.l could be      determined in precisely the same way as indicated with respect to the      generator application. </PAR><PAR>  Various modes of carrying out the present invention are contemplated as      being within the scope of the following claims particularly pointed out      and distinctly claiming the subject matter which is regarded as the      invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
