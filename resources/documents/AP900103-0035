(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New York state high school students canthrow away their slide rules.   Starting next year, students taking Regents' math exams will beable to use calculators to check their addition, subtraction,multiplication and division, said Fred Paul, head of the stateEducation Department's mathematics bureau.   ``What a nice, forward-looking move,'' said Shirley Frye,president of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.   Students have long been permitted to use slide rules to helpthem in Regents' exams, which are designed for college-boundstudents.   Most of the Regents' math test involves problem-solving in areaslike algebra, geometry and trigonometry. Students will still berequired to show the work involved in reaching a conclusion, withthe calculators just helping them check the basic computations,Paul said.   The calculators still will not be allowed for basic mathproficiency tests at all grade levels, he said. And students willonly be permitted to bring in the simple, four-function calculatorsthat add, subtract, multiply and divide, he said.   ``Calculators are part of everyday technology,'' Frye said.``What we really want to know is whether students can solveproblems. Computation is just a small part of mathematics.''   The head of the math teachers group said there's a certainsegment of society that wants students today to suffer with thesame calculations they had to go through. But it's impractical, shesaid.   ``You don't see any adults in real life doing 30 long-divisionproblems,'' Frye said. ``If a person doing income tax wasn't usingthe modern technology, you probably wouldn't go to them.''   Since New York and California, which is developing plans toinclude calculators in teaching curriculum, are both leaders ineducation policy, Frye said she expected other states to follow inallowing calculators on tests.   Calculators will first be allowed on the June 1991 math Regentsexams, Paul said.</TEXT></DOC>
