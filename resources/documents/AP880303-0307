On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for Aprildelivery closed 5 cents lower at $15.67 per 42-gallon barrelWednesday. The contract had been down as much as 30 cents early inthe day.   Among refined products, wholesale gasoline for April deliveryfinished at 44.90 cents per gallon, off .39 cent.   Near-term contracts for wholesale heating oil moved counter tothe market's bearish trend with the contract for April deliverysettling at 43.93 cents per gallon, up .46 cent.   Analysts said reports of relatively low supplies of heating oil,compared to levels of previous years, touched off the buying inthat sector.   But in general, analysts said the market was confused bydiscrepancies in official estimates of crude oil reserves ascompiled by the American Petroleum Institute and the Department ofEnergy.   A gap between the estimates issued in recent weeks has puttraders on the defensive.   ``There is a scarcity of hard fundamental information rightnow,'' observed William Byers, an analyst with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.``We've come to the end of the heating seasons, and traders arelooking for something to hold on to.''</TEXT></DOC>
