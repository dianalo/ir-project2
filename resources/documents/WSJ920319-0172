Bill Clinton, the Rhodes scholar and Yale lawyer, made hisreputation nationally as a spokesman for innovativeapproaches to policy questions, as a leading voice foroverhauling government and as a sober visionary for theDemocratic Party. But critics in his home state of Arkansasand even some of his allies persist in calling him SlickWillie, a sobriquet that sends him into a rage.</LP><TEXT>   Now that Mr. Clinton has a big lead in the race for hisparty's presidential nomination, political analysts andDemocratic leaders are wondering whether the party ticketmight be led by a brilliant policy wizard or by asmooth-talking magus who, as Shirley Meecham, a Democrat whoserved in the Arkansas House for 16 years, puts it, &quot;can sellyou something that you don't need.&quot;   Indeed, Mr. Clinton's position in Democratic politics haschanged notably in the past several months.   The candidate who began the race defending himself againstcharges that he was a &quot;warmed-over Republican&quot; scored hisbreakthrough against Paul Tsongas in part by questioning theDemocratic credentials of the former Massachusetts senator.The man who started out as a moderate found himself courtingthe Democratic left. The Arkansas governor who positionedhimself as a friend to business criticized his rival as beinga creature of Wall Street. The contender who called forshifting spending from defense to domestic matters came outtwo weeks before the Connecticut primary in favor ofcontinuing production of the Seawolf nuclear submarine, whichwas to be built in Connecticut and which even the Bushadministration now opposes.   &quot;He's shown himself very adept to adapt to all kinds ofshifting currents,&quot; says James Reichley of the BrookingsInstitution. &quot;In that respect he is a very accomplishedpolitical operator.&quot;   Mr. Clinton's advisers argue that the political racechanged, not Mr. Clinton. &quot;It's all been serendipitousadjustment,&quot; says George Stephanopoulos, the deputy campaignmanager. &quot;He's always had a broad, multifaceted appeal, anddifferent groups looked at different facets. What we'rehoping is that the coalition that develops in the next fewweeks brings them together.&quot;   The governor adds: &quot;I'm still making the same points inthe same way I articulated them last fall.&quot;   Even so, Mr. Clinton's road to the Democratic nominationis following the slender line between political slickness andpolitical genius. His campaign is one part policy seminar andone part traveling salvation show -- and in this electionseason he has indeed assembled a remarkable coalition.   In both this coalition and his own political persona, Mr.Clinton resembles Franklin D. Roosevelt, who in his day wasregarded as something of a slick operator himself -- a&quot;chameleon on plaid,&quot; in Herbert Hoover's timeless phrase. Inhis first presidential campaign, Mr. Roosevelt equivocated onProhibition, on U.S. entry into the League of Nations and oncorruption in Tammany Hall. He went on to be a controversialpresident -- but the deftest political figure of his age,transforming both the calculus of politics and the structureof government for a generation.   &quot;Like Clinton today, there was a sense of Roosevelt as aman on the make,&quot; says William Leuchtenburg, a University ofNorth Carolina historian and Roosevelt biographer.   Clinton allies such as Betsey Wright, formerly his chiefof staff, argue that Mr. Clinton has been punished for hislightning intelligence and personality. &quot;He thinks veryrapidly and speaks what he is thinking in completesentences,&quot; she says. &quot;Sometimes people label that as slickand packaged instead of rewarding the quickness of the mind.&quot;   Some of his friends, moreover, argue that the governor'sstyle has been misread by the national press and theWashington establishment. &quot;This `Slick Willie' thing iscrazy,&quot; says Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, a television producerand longtime friend of Mr. Clinton's. &quot;I know what Bill'sflaws are, and being slick just isn't one of them. He is theopposite of slick. He just wants to please people. If he wereslick, he wouldn't have had to fight his way to thenomination with a machete.&quot;   Even so, Mr. Clinton's record, including accounts of howhe angled to avoid the draft, has left many Democrats uneasy.John White, a former national party chairman, says thegovernor won't be able to win the White House unless he can&quot;raise the comfort level people have with him.&quot;   Mr. Clinton counts himself as an early supporter of thePersian Gulf War, but two days before it began he wonderedwhether &quot;we should give sanctions more time and maybe evenexplore a full-scale embargo.&quot; For years he opposed usingMedicaid funds to pay for abortions, but now says he wouldn'tveto such legislation as president.   To foreign entrepreneurs, he has boasted that Arkansas wasa right-to-work state, but he told Jesse Jackson's RainbowCoalition this year that he &quot;would probably sign&quot; legislationoutlawing right-to-work statutes. And he launched hispresidential bid after pledging in his 1990 gubernatorialcampaign that he would &quot;serve four years&quot; as governor. Thatprompted Meredith Oakley, the associate editor of theArkansas Democrat, to start a column on his entry into thepresidential race this way: &quot;His word is dirt.&quot;   Politics is the art of the compromise, of course, and Mr.Clinton is by no means the only political figure to facequestions about what he said and did in the past. PresidentReagan increased taxes, Richard Nixon imposed wage and pricecontrols and John Kennedy made concessions tosegregationists. President Bush was best known in the lastcampaign for six words -- &quot;Read my lips: No new taxes&quot; --that didn't turn out to be his last words on the subject.   In a bloody, sometimes sordid, often perplexing campaign,Mr. Clinton, who wanted to appear as the candidate of the&quot;new politics,&quot; has found himself battling Mr. Tsongas withtwo of the most dependable chestnuts of old Democraticpolitics: charging that his rival wasn't sufficientlycommitted to Social Security and questioning Mr. Tsongas'scommitment to Israel. These drifts into traditional tacticsworry some of his advisers, especially those in theDemocratic Leadership Council, the moderate group Mr. Clintonled until he began his campaign. &quot;We hope his voice will comeback,&quot; says Alvin From, executive director of the council.   Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, have shown theirwillingness to adapt before. Mr. Clinton lost his first bidfor re-election in 1980, in part because Arkansans wereuncomfortable with a First Lady who didn't use her husband'sname. Soon, his wife, once known as Hillary Rodham, begancalling herself Mrs. Clinton.   These days, observers note, Mr. Clinton speaks crisply touniversity audiences, uses country slang before working-classaudiences and, last weekend, showed up in the black SecondBaptist Church in Evanston, Ill., talking in rhymes. &quot;He'sbeen able to play the primary game by portraying himself as adifferent type of candidate to different audiences,&quot; saysSandy Maisel, a Colby College political scientist.   These skills are some of the tools of politics, and infive terms as governor Mr. Clinton has used them well. Evenhis critics agree that he has helped boost education in thestate. He has fashioned innovative approaches to welfare,fought the school dropout rate and brought about improvementsin prenatal care.   But he's still a controversial figure in his state. PaulGreenberg, editorial page editor of the Pine Bluff Commercialand a relentless critic of the governor, first came up withthe name &quot;Willie Slick&quot; and then popularized it as &quot;SlickWillie.&quot; But as much as Mr. Clinton hates the name, he hasnot been able to shake it fully, and it has entered theArkansas political argot; today capital insiders in LittleRock refer to a &quot;Slick Willie move&quot; or say that the governor&quot;pulled a Slick Willie.&quot;   Mr. Clinton's defenders say that the unexpected challengeof Mr. Tsongas forced the governor to relinquish hispolitical purity in an effort to distinguish himself from hisrival. &quot;He didn't move as much as absorb the more traditionalarguments&quot; of the party, says Ms. Wright, the former chief ofstaff.   For all his shifts, Mr. Clinton has some core beliefs. Heseems more rooted in domestic issues than, say, PresidentBush, especially on matters of children, education and civilrights. He speaks often and with feeling about how his ownlife was changed by educational opportunities and how, in thepostwar South, thousands were living below the poverty line,&quot;kept dumb,&quot; as he explained to England's ManchesterGuardian, &quot;by the old politics of racial division.&quot;   In Arkansas, however, people have their own anthologies ofClinton stories, many of them with a common theme: thedifficulty of pinning him down.   &quot;There are times when you need to say before a vote:`Governor, write that down for me because you're going toforget you promised me this,'&quot; says state Rep. John Dawson.&quot;You kind of have to nail him to the wall.&quot;   In 1983 Mr. Clinton worked for the Legislature's supportin raising the sales tax to 4% from 3%. The Arkansas FairnessCouncil, a coalition of labor groups, blacks, women'sorganizations and others, asked him to exempt food from thesales tax. He refused. The coalition then suggested a rebatefor low-income taxpayers, which Mr. Clinton accepted so as toget the penny increase through the House. But when thelegislation got to the Senate, Mr. Clinton reneged on hisagreement, the group contends.   &quot;We counted on him,&quot; says Brownie Ledbetter, president ofthe council. &quot;We stood there and watched while he broke hisword. It happened whiz-bang.&quot;   Mr. Clinton says the coalition misinterpreted the natureof their agreement. His gubernatorial press secretary,Michael Gauldin, says the governor still hasn't ruled outsome tax relief on groceries, but there remain questionsabout how to make up the revenue that would be lost.   That incident still rankles J. Bill Becker, who for threedecades has been president of the AFL-CIO of Arkansas. &quot;Youcannot take {his} commitments to the bank,&quot; says Mr. Becker.&quot;I have never dealt with a governor like that. He's yourfriend, but when you go to the Legislature you get no help atall. People call him Slick Willie because he will tell peoplewhat they want to hear and then evade and avoid and explainaway.&quot;   Mr. Clinton's evolution on the abortion question left evenhis allies perplexed.   The governor, who regards himself as an abortion-rightssupporter, never went as far as feminists and other women'sgroups would have liked. To his staff, he once defended hisopposition to Medicaid funding for abortions by drawing aparallel between abortion opponents who don't want their taxmoney used to end pregnancies and Vietnam War protesters whodidn't want their tax money used to wage the war.   Now, however, he says he wouldn't veto legislationpermitting public funding for abortion. &quot;It seemed like itwas almost overnight,&quot; says Barbara Middleton, formerpresident of the Arkansas chapter of the NationalOrganization for Women. &quot;He's always out there kind ofcompromising. That's what makes him a good politician.&quot;   &quot;As governor of Arkansas his positions reflect what heperceives the people of Arkansas want,&quot; says Mr. Gauldin, hisstatehouse press secretary. &quot;I don't think necessarily he cancarry every attitude of one particular state when he goes tothe national stage. At the national level, he has torecalibrate.&quot;   In another instance, Rep. Dave Obey of Wisconsin privatelytold colleagues that Mr. Clinton told him the congressionalpay raise passed in 1990 was a good idea. But during thecampaign, the governor has denounced the pay increase and,before the Democratic state convention in Lake Buena Vista,Fla., assailed members of Congress who &quot;raised their pay andtheir perks in the middle of the night.&quot;   John Reilly, a major figure in Walter Mondale'spresidential campaign, marvels at how the governor hasmanaged to portray himself as the anti-establishment figure-- perhaps his ultimate bit of recasting. &quot;It's ridiculous tocharacterize Bill Clinton as an outsider,&quot; he says. &quot;He's theconsummate insider. He knows every dignitary standing at thebottom of every airplane stairway in every town to greet him.This guy has been an insider since third grade.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
