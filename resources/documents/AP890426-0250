The Commerce Department said that almost half of the increase inthe gross national product came from a statistical catch-up fromlast year's drought.   But even discounting this bookkeeping factor, the GNP,representing the country's total output of goods and services,advanced at a 3 percent annual rate, down only slightly from a 3.5percent non-farm growth rate in the final three months of 1988.   The dollar fell against most major currencies in domestictrading after the release of today's report, while bond prices weremostly lower.   The Bush administration hailed the GNP report as good news thatthe economy is continuing to expand at a healthy rate.   Officials noted in particular the fact that the trade deficit,which had been widening for two consecutive quarters, showedimprovement again in the first three months of the year whilebusiness investments rose at the fastest pace since last spring.   ``There is nothing to indicate a recession in 1989 from thesenumbers,'' J. Antonio Villamil, the Commerce Department's chiefeconomist, said at a news briefing. ``We are getting solid,moderate growth with the kind of mix we need at this stage of theexpansion.''   The non-farm growth was slightly better than economists had beenexpecting. Most analysts believe the U.S. economy will slowsubstantially this year under the weight of higher interest rates.   For the past year, the Federal Reserve has been pushing rateshigher in an effort to fight rising inflationary pressures.   However, the report contained information that inflation isrising. A GNP price index which measures a fixed marketbasket ofgoods and services rose at an annual rate of 5 percent in the firstquarter, up from a fourth-quarter rate of 4.2 percent.   Half of the increase came from a pay raise for federalemployees, with rising food and home costs accounting for much ofthe rest of the increase.   The 5.5 percent overall increase in the GNP was more than doublethe 2.4 percent advance in the October-December quarter, the lastperiod in which output was held back because of the lingeringeffects of last summer's drought.   With the start of the new year, the government returned itsestimate of farm output to normal levels, thus accounting for 2.5percentage points of the 5.5 percent increase in the first quarter.   Economists expect growth for the remainder of the year to slowdramatically as the economy adjusts to the year-long credittightening done by the Fed.   The Bush administration and some private economists have begunto express fears that the central bank could overdo itsanti-inflation battle and risk pushing the country into anotherrecession.   However, other analysts believe the Fed will be able to engineerthe tricky ``soft landing'' in which interest rates rise enough todampen inflaionary pressures but not enough to choke off thesix-year-old recovery, the longest in peacetime history.   Today's GNP report showed that the country's total outputclimbed to $5.117 trillion, the first time in history it topped the$5 trillion mark.   This figure is before inflation is taken into account. Afteradjusting for inflation, the GNP rose $54.8 billion in the firstquarter to $4.088 trillion. This figure is expressed in 1982dollars.   The 5.5 percent GNP increase was the largest advance since a 6.1percent jump in the fourth quarter of 1987.   For all of 1988, the GNP rose 3.9 percent, the best performancein four years. The Bush administration, counting on continuedstrong growth to help reduce the federal budget deficit, isforecasting that growth in 1989 will dip only slightly to 3.2percent.   However, many private economists believe that forecast is fartoo optimistic and total growth for the year will be 2.7 percent orless, a sluggish rate which would not be enough to keepunemployment from rising.   The first quarter GNP report provided some evidence that theeconomy was slowing.   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economicactivity, rose at a rate of just 1.3 percent, the slowest advancein more than a year. Purchases of durable goods such as autosactually fell by 3.2 percent in the first quarter while purchses ofproducts not expected to last three years edged up 2 percent.   Housing construction, another key consumer sector, dropped at anannual rate of 3.6 percent in the first quarter, the first declinein a year as the housing industry suffered under the impact ofrising mortgage rates.   While these two key sectors were flashing signals of a slowdown,other segments of the economy demonstrated strength from Januarythrough March.   The country's intractable trade deficit, which had actually beenrising for two consecutive quarters, posted a modest improvement inthe first quarter as a 10.6 percent rise in exports was enough tooffset a 2.3 percent increase in imports.   In a separate report, the government said that corporateprofits, after taxes, increased 3.2 percent in the fourth quarterof last year, slighlty better than the previous report which hadput the increase at 2.8 percent.   The latest survey of 50 top economists issued each month by BlueChip Economic Indicators, an investment newsletter, showed thatmore than half of the panel now expect a recession to begin by latethis year or early next year. The Blue Chip consensus forecastcalls for GNP growth this year at a lackluster rate of 2.7 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
