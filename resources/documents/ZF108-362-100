SOLUTIONS!andM;1.andP;  COMPUTER AIDEDandM;SOFTWAREandM;ENGINEERINGandM;PROBLEM: How do I integrate CASE tools into an existing software-developmentprogram--especially if that program involves supporting multivendor systems?andM;SOLUTION: Initially, choose CASE tools that are available across multiplevendors' hardware.andP;  But remember not to put all your emphasis on the toolsalone.andP;  You still must update your total software life-cycle methodologies,while taking into account the educational, corporate-culture modification andother management issues that arise with CASE.andM;IBM Corp. would have you believe that its corporate computer aided softwareengineering (CASE) strategy, known as AD/Cycle, is the final word on CASE.andO;If you want to engineer applications using CASE, you just use theIBM-sanctioned tools and adhere to the data-repository strategy outlined byIBM.andP;  Claimed result: The pieces will magically fall into place.andM;But systems integrators involved in the nitty-gritty of implementing CASEknow better.andP;  &quot;People put too much emphasis on the tolls,&quot; says Al Kortesoja,a principal with Ernst andamp; Young's Advanced CASE Technology Center.andP;  &quot;In orderto be effective with CASE , you have to change the way you manage, scheduleand monitor systems development.andP;  If you don't, and view CASE as just anotherproductivity tool, it ends up costing you more, rather than less, to developwith CASE.&quot;andM;Kortesoja advocates you move away from generic CASE and, instead, work with acustomizable CASE toolkit, as Ernst andamp; Young is doing.andP;  Its solution is basedon KnowledgeWare Inc.'s KnowledgeWAre product line, one of the tools in IBM'sAD/Cycle environment.andM;Nevertheless, Ernst andamp; Young brings to the party its information-enginerringapproach, or methodology.andP;  It includes methods for uodating the entiresoftware life-cycle, as well as for establishing standards and guidelines fortool use.andM;Coopers andamp; Lybrand employs a similar CASE approach--with one major exception.andO;&quot;Unlike some vendors that are going with a purely IBM strategy, we need amore portable CASE factory, especially for Digital Equipment Corp. and UNIXenvironments,&quot; says George VanNess director of Coopers' InformationTechnology Group.andM;Coopers andamp; Lybrand is building on Teamwork, a tool designed by CadreTechnologies Inc.andP;  The product operates in both the UNIX and OS/2 worlds.andM;Cadre is in the process of adding interfaces to various IBM and non-IBMapplications.andP;  Such a tool allows users to build on a true data-repositoryfoundation today, VanNess says, instead of forcing them to wait a year or twofor IBM's repository to materialize.andM;Some systems integrators, such as Covia, argue that none of the existing CASEproducts enable true repository-integration capabilities.andP;  Like Ernst andamp; Youngand Coopers andamp; Lybrand, Covia has developed a total CASE-based, life-cyclestrategy.andM;&quot;Our first challenge,&quot; says Mark Teflian, Covia's chief information officer,&quot;is to fill out the automation of a much larger life cycle.andP;  Lots of our workdeals with subsystems and the integration of various systems.andP;  CASE toolstoday don't address these issues.&quot;andM;At the same time, it's important not to become preoccupied with technicalCASE concerns.andP;  Says Kortesoja, &quot;You must change the way you work with usersand you need to educate management realistically about CASE's benefits.&quot;andM;2.andP;  COMPUTERandM;INTEGRATEDandM;MANUFACTURINGandM;PROBLEM: I think CIM will increase in importance as a technology, yet mycustomers still balk at CIM, because there are too many horror stories.andP;  Whatapproach should I take?andM;SOLUTION: Tell them the technology is here.andP;  It's people who mess up.andP;  Tohandle the people problem, establish detailed and conservative programs thatset reasonable expectations for CIM in advance.andP;  Identify areas ofoverexpectation early before a lot of money is spent.andM;The technology for computer integrated manufacturing (CIM) is here.andP;  As amatter of fact, says Larry McAllsiter of Digital Equipment Corp., &quot;Thehardware available today has greater capability than our customers canabsorb.&quot;andM;McAllister, who is a systems integrator at DEC's Solutions Integration Centerin Atlanta, adds: &quot;CIM Hardware issues are not a limiting factor.andP;  It's thepeople and management issues that you must be really careful with.&quot;andM;You face two conflicting people/management issues with your customers, saysMcAllister: indifference and overexpectation.andM;Indiffernce: J. Kevin Fisher, president of systems integrator ProductivitySolutions Inc., notes that many companies initiate projects--even complex CIMprojects--with little more than a hope &quot;that things will get done throughsome serendipitous process.&quot;andM;There's little planning.andP;  Ironically, he says, this indifference leads to thesecond problem.andM;Overexpectations: Much of CIM today involves writing custom software.andP;  And,&quot;Everybody who has performed custom software development has had a mismatchof expectation between customer management and the software-developmentengineers concerning the functionality of the system,&quot; says McAllister.andM;The core of the problem is poor communications between you and the variouslevels of your customers, and that's due in part to the many disciplinesinvolved in a porject.andP;  In software development, for example, you may havesoftware developers talking to design engineers.andM;Says Al Connor, vice president of marketing at Nastec Corp., &quot;Most softwaredevelopers didn't start as engineers, and they lach the well-definedmethodologies of design engineers.andP;  [To software developers] softwareengineering is more of an art form.&quot;andM;At DEC, McAllister says, &quot;We've adopted some conservative procedures arounddefining software functionality and demonstrating it--and getting thecustomer's buy-in--early in the development cycle.andP;  That way, if there is anymismatch of expectation, it's identified before a lot of moeny is spent.&quot;andM;Productivity Solutions's Fisher says, &quot;Project management helps managerdefine project goals and use resources in the most efficient ways possible.&quot;andM;3.andP;  DISPLAYSandM;PROBLEM: VGA or 8514?andP;  Which standard do I adopt for displays?andM;SOLUTION: Settle on 8514.andP;  It's got the best basic resolution available now,and it will have the most support.andM;But don't count out Texas Instruments Inc.'s 34010 graphics chip.andP;  It's IBMCorp.4s principal competition in the graphics business.andP;  NEC Home ElectronicsInc. recently introduced the Multi-Sync Generator Engine, based on the 34010.andO;NEC  claims the engine provides a four-fold speed increase over the 8514.andM;The Videio Graphics Array (VGA), designed to run on Intel Corp's80386-products, provides a minimum 640-pixel-by-480-pixel resolution.andP;  SuperVGA jumps to 800 to 600 pixels.andP;  The 8514, in the extended mode, goes to1,280-pixel-by-1,024-pixel resolution.andM;4.andP;  EISA VS.andP;  MCAandM;PROBLEM: I'm confused about the controversy surrounding EISA vs.andP;  MCA buses.andO;DO I need either of them yet?andP;  How do I choose?andM;SOLUTION: Reliability and faster throughput are good reasons to consider32-bit-bus-based machines.andP;  But the jury is still out on which bus will bethe industry standard.andM;The growth of client-server networks in recent years lies behind theappearance of 32-bit buses.andP;  Such environments stimulate the need forhigh-performance server systems capable of performing back-end databaseoperations; arbitrating access to multiple, high-throughput peripherals; andproviding file services for work groups and departments.andP;  Desktop machinesare taking on an increased role in sharing information across peer-to-peernetworks.andM;This means more traffic goind throught servers and workstations.andP;  TheIndustry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus found on IBM Corp.'s widely used ATcomputers and clones has 16-bit data-transfer capabilities and up to an 8Mbyte-per-second data transfer rate.andP;  Faster, more reliable performancerequires a jump to 32-bit-bus machines that have pushed data-transfer ratesup to 40M bytes per second.andM;Two such buses use the Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) andMicro Channel Architecture (MCA).andP;  The MCA was developed by IBM for its PS/2line of machines and has been cross-licensed to several other vendors.andP;  AndMCA targets IBM's RISC System/6000 workstations.andM;EISA-based computers have been offered by the Gang of Nine, which includesAST Research Inc., Compaq Computer Corp., Epson America Inc., Hewlett-PackardCo., NEC Technologies Inc. and Zenith Data Systems.andM;Which bus is right for you?andP;  Both buses have similar characteristics, addingconfusion to the bus controversy.andM;In comparison with the AT bus, EISA and MCA are better with high-volumeenvironments.andP;  Both also support bus masters, devices that relieve the CPU offunctions related to managing high-speed peripherals.andM;Only a limited number of EISA storage and communications boards wereavailable early this year to fill the system's eight, 32-bit EISA slots,although more are coming.andP;  On the other hand, EISA accepts standard 8-bit and16-bit ISA expansion boards, which MCA does not.andM;&quot;This expands board and computer choices open to systems integrators,&quot; saysPeter Harvey, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) manager atBusTek Corp. &quot;Integrators can purchase AT boards for ISA machines, knowingthat the boards will be viable for EISA systems installed down the road.&quot;andM;If you want to move now, consider the marketing strategies of the companiesbehind each bus.andP;  Computer vendors supporting EISA machines see thempredominantly as netweok servers, while IBM stresses MCA computers as part ofdistributed processing.andM;5.andP;  ELECTRONIC MAILandM;PROBLEM: My business has different electronic mail systems operating over itsLANs.andP;  How do I mesh these systems, ir add new ones, so that they can talk toeach other?andM;SOLUTION: Look at X.400 interfaces and other products designed to connect orwork with disparate corporate mail systems.andM;Many companies have installed several different brands of electronic mailsystems to satisfy the requirements of platforms and networks used byindividual departments.andP;  However, departmental networks are becomingincreasingly integrated into corporate-wide systems.andP;  Many companies alsofind it desirable to stay in close touch with their suppliers and customersover electronic data interchange (EDI) networks.andM;Thus, employees need to communicate with colleagues in all parts of anenterprise and throughout the business community.andP;  They have no choice.andP;  Theymust use whatever electronic mail systems the company has in place.andM;This won't be easy.andP;  &quot;Completely different local area networks (LANs) andplatforms may exist side by side in a company,&quot; says Phil Whalen, vicepresident of marketing at cc:Mail Inc.andP;  &quot;Most mail systems are tied to theplatform's operating system.andP;  Thus, proprietary mail packages, by themselves,cannot talk to each other.&quot;andM;Several complimentary solutions provide a way out of this problem.andO;Soft-Switch Inc., for instance, offers an electronic mail network switch thatsupports more than 20 electronic mail packages and protocols, includingX.400, simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) and Systems Network ArchitectureDistribution Services (SNADS).andP;  This product also provides network-managementfacilities and mail-enabled applications.andP;  The latter includes libraryservices, bulletin boards and printing services.andM;&quot;Customers can plug in different electronic mail systems off of our backboneto become part of an enterprise mail netowrk,&quot; says Don Fisher, vicepresident of open-systems marketing at Soft-Switch.andM;Another option is to install an independent electronic mail package, such ascc:Mail, designed to work in a variety of networking environmens.andP;  Inaddition, many electronic mail companies are creating proprietary gateways toease communications between each other's products.andP;  Cc:Mail, for example,offers gateways between its electronic mail system and IBM Corp.'s PROFS,Digital Equipment Corp.'s All-in-1 and Western Union Corp.'s Easylink.andM;Then there's X.400, an internationally accepted set of protocols intended tomake communications transparent among different types of electronic mailsystems.andP;  Systems that incorporate X.400 links can presumably communicatewith each other.andM;&quot;X.400, however, is in its early implementation stage,&quot; says cc:Mail'sWhalen.andP;  &quot;There is not even an industry-wide body to perform X.400compatibility certification, although some vendors such as SprintInternational are attempting certification.&quot;andM;But customer pressure may speed up broader application of X.400.andP;  TheAerospace Industries Association, for example, has induced ATandamp;T Co. and MCICommunications Corp. to interconnect their widely used electronic mailservices via the X.400 standard.andP;  However, don't get too accustomed to X.400;standrads bodies are already hammering out X.500.andM;6.andP;  FACTORY NETWORKSandM;PROBLEM: How do I pick among MAP, OSI and the many proprietary factorynetworks?andM;SOLUTION: For the time being, install whatever your customer wants.andP;  Just besure that it's compatible with OSI.andM;After 1995 or so, everybody will be installing Open Systems Interconnection(OSI) networks.andP;  That's because OSI, already the factory network of choice inEurope and Japan, is on its way to becoming the international communicationsstandard.andP;  Therefore, U.S.andP;  companies will have to adopt it or die.andM;The vendors of proprietary factory networks have faced up to theinevitability of OSI and are making products to support it.andP;  DigitalEquipment Corp., for example, is basing its latest DECnet version on OSI.andP;  Itis calling the product DECnet/OSI Phase V.andM;And the proponents of Manufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP) are doing thesame.andP;  In fact, says Roger Biery, a product manager at Ungermann-Bass Inc.,andO;&quot;The most important thing that MAP offers is OSI [compliance].&quot;andM;MAP's architecture also follows the seven layers of OSI.andP;  Ironically,Ungermann-Bass quit selling MAP products recently, because it wasn't makingmoney with them.andM;Advantages of MAP: It also complies with the federal government's GovernmentOpen Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP) standard.andP;  GOSIP is Uncle Sam'sfirst big move into OSI compliance and will be mandated in virtually all U.S.andO;government communications systems after August.andM;In some ways, MAP is a better product for GOSIP than the OSI, which isearlier in its development stage.andP;  Notes Kevin Mills, a systems integrator inthe National Institute of Standards and Technology, &quot;MAP has its ownnetwork-management standard and its own directory services standard.andP;  As yet,there are no OSI standards for these functions.&quot;andM;Realistically, MAP will remain a powerful force in factory communications aslong as there is a General Motors Corp., the godfather of MAP.andP;  GeneralMotors will spend $10 million a year for the next two years on MAP.andP;  And bothDEC and IBM Corp. have announced support for MAP.andP;  IBM installed MAP at itsEndicott plant in Binghamton, N.Y.andM;Nevertheless, OSI will eventually prevail.andP;  &quot;OSI will make it, no matterwhat,&quot; says Robert Franklin, a systems integrator at Motorola Inc.andP;  &quot;Thequestion is when.&quot;andM;7.andP;  GATEWAYSandM;PROBLEM: Your company has just acquired another company.andP;  You and youracquisition, however, come to the table with systems based on differentprotocols.andP;  You can't afford a total network overhaul.andP;  How do you get thesesystems to work together?andM;SOLUTION: Use specialized internetworking devices called gateways, routersand bridges to interconnect heterogeneous networks.andM;According to Dr. Andy De Mari, Retix Chairman and CEO: &quot;Specifically,gateways convert protocls used in incompatible networks for a givenapplication.andP;  Routers direct network traffic--much the way a telephone switchroutes a telephone call--depending upon the type of network traffic, choiceof paths and the responsiveness required by the application.andP;  And bridgesconnect local area networks (LANs), allowing data to pass between themtransparently, like on a single LAN.&quot;andM;Example: A company has a corporate network using Systems Network Architecture(SNA) between its data-processing centers.andP;  In addition, several token-ringLANs with personal computers (PCs) are present--they are not integrated withthe mainframes.andM;Another company uses for data processing Digital Equipment Corp.'sminicomputers (DEC VAXes) that are interconnected by a transmission controlprotocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) network over Ethernet.andP;  The goal: providea corporate-wide electronic-mail system to ensure close communication betweenthe two companies in a combined organization.andM;To start off with, bridges are used to interconnect the token-ring LANs.andP;  Arouter directs certain traffic from the TCP/IP network to the internetwork.andO;And gateways convert the systems network architecture distribution services(SNADS) protocol used by IBM Corp. electronic-mail systems and the simplemail transfer protocol (SMTP) used in TCP/IP networks to a common X.400protocol.andM;Each gateway attaches to the existing network, in this casE, an Ethernet andan RS232 modem port and a common wide area network (WAN).andP;  This may be apublic X.25 or X.400 network or a network of private lines.andP;  Each gatewaysimulates a number of users on each network to which it is connected butrelays the mail for each simulated user to the real user on the othernetwork.andM;The gateways must convert message formats between X.400, IBM's DocumentInformation Architecture/Document Content Architecture (DIA/DCA) and theTCP/IP message format called RFC-822.andP;  They must also retain a correspondenceamong all the addresses over each network, converting them as necessary.andM;In the case of the PC LAN, a native X.400 electronic-mail package isinstalled.andP;  The X.400 is provided on a PC acting as a server, which other PCswith client software may access for sending and receiving mail.andP;  The clientand server software communicate via a network operating system such as NovellInc.'s NetWare or Microsoft Corp.'s LAN Manager.andP;  Note that the serverperforms no conversions, because the X.400 service is directly available toeach PC on the network.andM;8.andP;  GROUPWAREandM;PROBLEM: I hear a lot about groupware, but I'm not sure what the noise is allabout.andP;  What can groupware do for me?andM;SOLUTION: Groupware is not all hype, but proceed with caution.andP;  Programs areexpensive and training requirements heavy.andP;  You can anticipate organizationalimpacts.andM;Groupware can be thought of as either the next generation of electronic mailor as an emerging category of network-oriented, production-managementsoftware.andP;  While groupware products vary widely, they purport to ease workamong employee gropus by integrating such features as electronic mail,meeting scheduling, task and appointment reminders, document sharing, projecttracking, maintenance of group calendars and shared to-do lists.andM;Components of groupware have been available for some time, particularly onmainframe and minicomputer-based office systems from such companies asDigital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and IBM Corp.andP;  Whatdistinguishes groupware is the applicability of such systems in theclient-server, distributed-processing architectures that increasinglycharacterizes many corporate environments.andM;Action Technologies Inc., Enable Software Inc., Lotus Development Corp. andWordPerfect Corp. are among the companies offering groupware fordistributed-processing environments.andM;Lotus' Notes for example, is &quot;client-server software that allows groups ofpeople to create and access information using personal computers (PCs), localarea networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs),&quot; says Eric Sall, directorof business applications for Notes.andP;  &quot;Notes helps you share databases acrossdissimilar networks and also allows you to use such databases with othergroup members to:andM;* Keep track of clients;andM;* Discuss product-design problems;andM;* Disseminate technical information or other news.&quot;andM;And Notes runs on multiple network operating systems, as well as on Ethernetand token-ring LANs.andM;Such products can be expensive.andP;  Notes, for instance, weighs in with a priceof $62,500 for a base installation of 200 PCs.andP;  There may also be significantcosts entailed in setting up a groupware system, training users, developingapplications, building gateways to disparate electronic mail systems andother services.andM;&quot;These components offer important consulting and support opportunities forsystems integrators,&quot; points out Sall.andM;Industry observers stress that the impact of groupware on corporate culturemay be considerable and should be anticipated.andM;9.andP;  IMAGEandM;PROCESSINGandM;PROBLEM: By most estimates, three out of four image-processing systems areproprietary and turnkey.andP;  I just can't integrate them into my customers'systems.andM;SOLUTION: Vendors of workstations and of add-in boards that run on standardplatforms are getting together to bring non-proprietary products to market.andO;Market analysts say that integratable image processors will account for 70percent of the products available in 1993, up from less than 30 percenttoday.andM;Image processing is becoming a function of add-in boards running onworkstations.andP;  Going with the flow, major workstation vendors are buying upboard makers that can put image processing on their platforms.andP;  Example: SunMicrosystems Inc. bought Transcept Systems in order to put its two-board,image-processing TAAC onto Sun workstations.andM;A barrier to non-proprietary image processing is that most image-processingsoftware is proprietary.andP;  To counter that, Sun has proposed a common softwareinterface--Virtual Processor Interface--as an ANSI standard.andM;But, the software issue may go away on its own.andP;  One who thinks that it willis John Montelione, president of Paragon Imaging Inc., a software developmentcompany.andP;  He says standard software will appear as vendors increasingly buildhardware to standards.andM;Big electronic companies are launching image-processing boards that will runon general-purpose workstations or personal computers (PCs).andP;  Example:Toshiba Corp., whose board runs on IBM Corp. PC/AT/XTs.andM;OEM agreements are popping up.andP;  Example: Visual Information Technologies(VITec), a maker of image-processing boards for the military, signedagreements with workstation vendors Megatek Corp. and Stardent Computer Inc.andO;VITec says its boards operate on any VMEbus machine running UNIX.andM;Leonard Yencharis of Yencharis Consulting Group, North Massapequa, N.Y., saysthe value of sales of image-processing hardware/software will double to morethan $900 million worldwide in 1993.andM;10.andP;  INTEGRATEDandM;SERVICES DIGITALandM;NETWORKandM;PROBLEM: ISDN seems to be coming along as an important network architecture.andO;What applications are currently available?andM;SOLUTION: Emerging ISDN applications include LAN bridging, desktop screensharing and advanced voice services.andP;  Additional services should be availablefrom related standards such as broadband ISDN, CCS#7 and SONET.andM;The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a digital communicationstechnology that permits simultaneous data, voice and video transmission overtwisted-pair telephone wires.andP;  ISDN's basic rate interface (BRI, or 2B + D)consists of two 64K-bits-per-second (bps) bearer channels and one 16K-bpscontrol channel, for a total of 144K bps.andP;  The primary rate interface (PRI,or 23B + D) uses 23 64K-bps bearer channels and one 64K-bps control channel,for almost the same speed as T1.andP;  X.25 packets can be sent over bothinterfaces.andM;According to Ron Denfeld, sales support manager of the ISDN Systems Divisionat Fujitsu Network Switching of America Inc., &quot;ISDN enables a range ofapplications.&quot;andP;  For example: ISDN advanced voice services include directorylookup, conference calls and automatic number identification.andO;Video-conferencing implementations can be arranged over ISDN for less costthan transmission over ordinary phone lines.andP;  ISDN also permits high-quality,Group IV facsimile transmissions.andM;And ISDN could play several roles in local area network (LAN) remote-bridgingapplications.andP;  ISDN provides stopgap backup, for instance, if a T1 linefails.andM;Moreover, &quot;ISDN can interconnect two LANs if the traffic between them can besatisfied by a medium-speed (64K bps to 128K bps) LAN-to-LAN link,particularly for interactive traffic,&quot; says Denfeld.andM;&quot;ISDN terminal adapters also provide relatively inexpensive, digital,high-speed, dial-up access to LAN communications servers from desktopcomputers or asynchronous terminals,&quot; says Denfeld.andP;  &quot;Transmissions extend to19.2K bps, compared to the 2.4K-bps modem speeds common in this environment.&quot;andO;And if data traffic isn't heavy, ISDN could be used instead of LANs toestablish file transfers or screen sharing among workstations.andM;How soon such applications become widespread is another question.andP;  &quot;Arelatively small population, composed of large corporations and universities,has implemented these applications so far,&quot; says Denfeld.andP;  &quot;We anticipatedramatic growth, however, in the number of ISDN lines installed as more phonecompanies announce ISDN tariffs and as ISDN switches, customer premisesequipment and software appears.&quot;andP;  Fujitsu, ATandamp;T Co., Teleos CommunicationsInc. and Vadis Inc. are among the companies providing ISDN products.andM;Over the next few years, an additional range of complementary servicesextending ISDN capabilities should become available.andM;11.andP;  INTERNETWORKINGandM;DEVICESandM;PROBLEM: What cost-effective hardware is available to interconnect my LANsand WANs into enterprise-wide voice/data networks?andM;SOLUTION: Consider systems that integrate bridges, routers and T1multiplexers.andM;Ending islands of automation among different local area networks (LANs) isbecoming a primary concern in many companies for several reasons.andP;  Here aretwo:andM;* Incompatible LANs must now fit into information networks that pervade theentire enterprise.andM;* Electronic mail and other applications that take advantage ofdistributed-processing technology are becoming more pervasive.andM;Result: &quot;Companies want to tie their networks back together at the corporatelevel without taking away computing power from the desktop,&quot; says Al Huefner,vice president of Codex Corp.'s Systems Division.andM;Wide area networks (WANs) may help bring those LANs together via devices thatblur traditional boundaries between the two types of networks.andP;  Codex, forinstance, has produced an Ethernet-based &quot;multiplexing bridge&quot; calledEtherSpan, which links T1 services with high-speed LAN data traffic.andM;Other companies are forming industry alliances for joint marketing of bridgesand routers with T1 products to meet the demand for internetworking devices.andO;For example: Network Equipment Technologies Inc. (NET) is selling its T1switch in tandem with cisco Systems Inc.'s data equipment.andP;  Eventually,cisco's devices will be built into NET's switches, according to Doug Tsui,cisco's product-marketing manager.andP;  &quot;Having one vendor integrate your voiceand data networks across the enterprise can be cost-effective management,&quot;Tsui says.andM;Additional LAN and T1 company partnerships include Vitalink CommunicationsInc. and StrataCom Inc., as well as Wellfleet Communications Inc. andNewbridge Networks Corp.andM;12.andP;  MASS STORAGEandM;PROBLEM: How do I select the best storage-backup technology for myapplications?andM;SOLUTION: You should use a technology-comparison chart andelimination-selection criteria to weed out inappropriate technologies.andM;In the 5-1/4-inch form factor alone, you'll have to consider quarter-inch andhalf-inch tape cartridge drives, 4mm digital audio tape (DAT) and 8mmhelical-scan tape drives.andP;  And don't forget write-once and rewritable opticaldisk drives.andM;Peripheral Strategies Inc., a Santa Barbara, Calif., market-research company,suggests using an eliminator-selector approach.andP;  Eliminator criteria includeminimum capacity, form factor, interchangeability, backward compatibility andreliability.andM;Selector criteria include drive cost, media cost, cost per megabyte, transferrate, backup time, file-access time, format standards, the company'sreputation and service history, drive and media availability, and systemsintegration considerations.andM;Coupled with a technology-comparison chart, the eliminator-selector approachenables you to weed out inappropriate technologies, while providing you witha scorecard to make the final decision.andM;Say your application requires a 5-1/4-inch form factor and at least 1G-byteof storage.andP;  Further assume access and backup times are not important.andP;  Youcan eliminate optical disk drives and half-inch and quarter-inch tape drivesfor insufficient capacity.andM;That leaves 4mm DAT and 8mm helical-scan tape drives.andP;  Because both are intheir first generation, backward compatibility is no problem.andM;At this point in the selection process, you'll have to weigh the importanceof various speed characteristics, including transfer rate, average accesstime and backup time.andP;  From there, you go to cost considerations.andM;Mike Peterson, president of Peripheral Strategies, expects the followingadvances:andM;* 1.3G-byte quarter-inch tape drives;andM;* 38OM-byte minicartridge tape drives;andM;* 1.2G-byte data cassette drives;andM;* 2.6G-byte 4mm DAT drives;andM;* 5G-byte 8mm helical-scan tape drives;andM;* A follow-on to market leader Digital Equipment Corp.'s TK70 half-inch tapecartridge drives;andM;* 1G-byte HI/TC half-inch, 3480 types of tape cartridge drives;andM;* Reel-to-reel tape drives in the 5-1/4-inch form factor;andM;* 1G-byte, 5-1/4-inch, rewritable magneto-optic drives and shipments ofphase-change rewritable optical media;andM;* Rewritable CD-ROM and multifunction optical disk drives;andM;* Increased speed specifications in all product categories.andM;Upshot: Your selection process will become harder before it becomes easier.andO;But, arm yourself with the appropriate elimination-selector criteria chartand the latest specification-comparison tables, and you'll save yourself agreat deal of preliminary head-scratching and hand-wringing.andM;13.andP;  METROPOLITANandM;AREA NETWORKSandM;PROBLEM: I need to install a network that connects company offices within ageographic region.andP;  LANs are too short, WANs are too slow.andP;  How do I proceed?andM;SOLUTION: Keep an eye on emerging metropolitan area network services andtechnologies.andM;First, companies hooked up departments within a building, then buildingswithin a campus.andP;  Now, many customers of systems integrators are ready tointerconnect sites located within a city-wide region.andM;&quot;You must meet two requirements to build effective metropolitan area networks[MANs],&quot; according to Joe Skorupa, director of product planning at RacalInterLan Inc.andP;  One requirement: The network must span a large geographicalarea.andP;  &quot;Ethernet and token-ring local area networks (LANs) are relativelylimited for this purpose,&quot; says Skorupa.andP;  &quot;Ethernet, for example, allows youto go only 2,500 meters before you have to insert a bridge or router toextend it further.&quot;andM;Another requirement: &quot;You need high bandwidth to accommodate the trafficgenerated by a network of networks.&quot;andP;  Why not use wide area networks (WANs)or the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) standard?andM;WANs typically run at speeds between 64K bits per second (bps) and T1 (1.544Mbps).andP;  This is not fast enough.andP;  If you have a building with a fiber backbonethat conforms to the 100M-bps FDDI standard, you would have to throttle itdown to run at 64K bps on the WAN, and that's not desirable, points outSkorupa.andM;One possible solution: The 802.6 standard being devised by the IEEE for MANs.andO;Bandwidth speeds for 802.6 MANs presently run from 1M bps to 600M bps.andP;  MANssupport voice, data and video traffic and are optimized for areas of50-kilometer diameter.andP;  &quot;Within such an area, you can have many drops arounda city for private or shared public networks,&quot; says Skorupa.andM;That's not all.andP;  In principle, FDDI networks could reach metropolitandimensions, but it would be expensive to string fiber around a city.andO;Moreover, FDDI networks are not compatible with phone systems, according toJim Mollenauer, vice president of advanced technology at Artel CommunicationsCorp.andM;IEEE MANs are compatible.andP;  They are designed to support T1 and T3 (45M bps)lines, as well as the synchronous optical network (SONET) standard.andM;When do we get IEEE 802.6?andP;  The IEEE approval process should be completed bymid-1990, says Mollenauer.andP;  He adds that telephone companies are planning tooffer switched multimegabit data services (SMDS) sometime next year.andP;  SMDSsupports 802.6 applications running on a MAN.andP;  MAN fast-packet switchingsystems are being field-tested by ATandamp;T Co. with several regional Bells.andM;14.andP;  MULTIMEDIAandM;PROBLEM: You've heard a lot about multimedia technology.andP;  How does it solveyour customers' business needs.andM;SOLUTION: Primary applications for multimedia are in the area of training andbusiness presentations.andP;  Actual programs, however, may take time to develop.andO;Keep an eye on electronic mail systems for transmitting multimedia-likecompound documents.andM;Multimedia hardware and software portend an era in which it will be common tomix and match text, graphics, still images and full-motion, full-screen videowithin a given &quot;document.&quot;andP;  Two standards are associated with the growinginterest in this technology.andP;  Both are based on CD-ROM (compact disc-readonly memory) technology, but each is oriented to a different market, for now.andM;One standard: Digital Video Interactive (DVI) uses a digital video framecompression algorithm that allows storage of more than one hour offull-motion, full-screen video on one CD disc.andP;  An equivalent decompressiontechnique is required to display these images on a screen.andP;  Audio, graphicsand other related standards are also being incorporated, or planned forincorporation, into DVI.andM;DVI is used with computers in business multimedia applications.andP;  Inprinciple, multimedia computers could capture and display video signals,recreate speech, show high-resolution animation and play high-quality sound,in addition to performing more traditional computer functions.andP;  IBM Corp.,andO;Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. are among the companies heavily involved indeveloping this technology.andM;Another standard: The Compact Disc-Interactive (CD-I) is a related multimediastandard targeted at standalone systems used by home consumers in conjunctionwith television sets and other monitors.andP;  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.andO;Ltd., Philips N. V. and Sony Corp. are prominent players in CD-I.andM;Interactive training programs and the preparation of presentation materialshould mark multimedia's initial use in the business world.andM;&quot;As a training tool, multimedia computers could deliver programs that peoplelearn at their own pace,&quot; says Rob Glazer, general manager of Microsoft'sMultimedia Systems Group.andP;  &quot;You could also develop powerful presentations atyour workstation that go way beyond the slide show level.andP;  One presentationmight consist, say, of rotating diagrams of a new sports car, video shots ofthe car's interior and sounds of the car accelerating.&quot;andM;At the systems level, Glazer believes that multimedia offers the promise of astandard way of archiving and retrieving compound documents--including visualand audio information--just as text and numbers are stored today.andP;  &quot;Thiswould open a whole new level of management organization that isn't possibleat present with analog materials,&quot; he says.andM;When will the wonders of multimedia become available?andP;  Many companies arecurrently working on technologies associated with DVI, including chip sets,boards and authoring software required to develop multimedia applications.andO;Higher bus speeds and improved compression algorithms will also contribute tothe viability of this technology.andM;Meanwhile, electronic-mail vendors point out that the compound-documentarchitecture already available in some systems enables you to integrate text,graphics and data files into your messages.andP;  &quot;We will offer voice as acomponent of our electronic mail package this year,&quot; says Phil Whalen, vicepresident of marketing at cc:Mail Inc.andP;  &quot;Ultimately, video will be theretoo.&quot;andM;15.andP;  NETWORKandM;MANAGEMENTandM;PROBLEM: I've got a lot of proprietary, standalone network-managementsystems.andP;  What do I do to integrate them to control costs and to providecentralized management?andM;SOLUTION: For the short term, use existing proprietary network-managementsystems and develop code on your own to meet current requirements.andP;  For thelong term, rely on Open Systems Interconnection standards to manage yourdisparate network-management systems.andM;The problem is well-known by now: How to link heterogeneous systems.andP;  In thiscase, it's network-management systems.andM;The typical scenario consists of a collection of proprietarynetwork-management subsystems, including those for modems, multiplexers andpacket switches and maybe some proprietary schemes.andP;  Add to that a variety ofbridges and routers and network-management databases.andP;  The goal: To integratethe subsystems while providing centralized management.andM;Not surprisingly, the solution of choice among systems integrators isstandards.andP;  &quot;We advocate standards because they give our customers long-termarchitectural integrity,&quot; says Kevin Wiant, marketing manager fornetwork-management services at Technology Concepts Inc. (TCI).andM;In particular, TCI is following the network-management standards work goingon at the International Standards Organization (ISO) and the Open SystemsInterconnection (OSI) network-management (OSI/NM) Forum.andM;The OSI/NM Forum is an industry group established to accelerate theintroduction of OSI-based network-management standards.andP;  So far, the Forumhas published protocol specifications, an application-services document andan object-specification framework.andP;  To come: conformance requirements.andM;The OSI upper-layer protocols for network management are referred to as thecommon management information protocol and services (CMIP/S).andP;  As with manystandards efforts, OSI network-management progress has been slow.andP;  Reason:Complexity of the project and because demand is relatively low.andP;  &quot;Not manycompanies are implementing OSI yet, but many of them are looking toward itand preparing for it,&quot; says Wiant.andM;In the meantime, you'll have to cobble together your own solutions.andP;  &quot;In theshort term,&quot; says Wiant, &quot;systems integrators must provide functionality thatmeets customer needs today, and look toward full OSI implementations in thelong term.&quot;andM;Fortunately, each major computer/communications vendor has outlinedOSI-compliant network-management migration strategies.andP;  IBM's NetView/PC isdesigned to integrate non-SNA network-management systems into the centralizedNetView management environment.andP;  ATandamp;T Co.'s OSI-based network-managementArchitecture (UNMA), which includes the company's Accumaster Integrator.andO;Digital Equipment Corp.'s OSI-based network-management strategy is calledEnterprise Management Architecture (EMA).andM;All of those master strategies are evolving.andP;  Analysts expect ATandamp;T's UNMA tobe the first unified network-management strategy to achieve full-OSIcompliance.andM;16.andP;  NETWORKandM;SECURITYandM;PROBLEM: In an era of increasing use of distributed-processing systems, I'mworried about my network being vulnerable to unauthorized user access.andP;  Howdo I protect my files and keep my systems on-line?andM;SOLUTION: Look to security procedures embedded in software applications anddatabase management systems.andM;As distributed-processing networks grow in geographic scope and complexity,companies are becoming more worried about protecting the integrity ofdatabases and other sources of corporate information that may be widelyshared among network users.andM;Database and application-software vendors have moved to cope with suchconcerns by structuring restrictions on user access, and other procedures,into their products.andM;For example, Notes, a groupware product from Lotus Development Corp., basesits security on the RSA public key encryption algorithm.andP;  This systemincludes such features as database-access control lists; data protection forprivacy; and allocation of privileges to view specific views, forms andfields.andP;  Notes incorporates cryptographic certificates that provideelectronic signatures certified by a trusted authority and also provides theoption of database audit trails.andM;&quot;With our products, you can create closed user communities that dictate whocan talk to whom and under what circumstances through an electronic mailnetwork,&quot; says Don Fisher, vice president for open systems marketing atSoft-Switch Systems Inc.andP;  This allows businesses concerned about maintainingorganizational hierarchies to maintain them, if they wish.andM;&quot;Our capabilities are useful if you don't want everyone able to send outinformation to competitors,&quot; says Fisher.andP;  &quot;You also may not want to receivemail from people not preregistered with you.andP;  That gives you some level ofconfidence against infiltration by viruses.&quot;andM;But these approaches have their limitations when you are dealing withheterogeneous networks.andP;  &quot;Few protective tools are available for suchenvironments,&quot; says Linda Vetter, director of Oracle Secure Systems.andM;Vetter continues: &quot;Look at the problems.andP;  If I identify and validate users ona Sun machine, must I do that again when he connects with the mainframe?andO;Does he have to know a different password?andP;  How do I audit the network if theuser is identified five different ways?&quot;andM;Ideally, believes Vetter, you want to define and authenticate users globallyto your computing resources.andP;  &quot;Oracle addresses security issues within adatabase context and platform vendors work on making their operating systemssecure, but dealing with the whole network can be a headache,&quot; she says.andM;17.andP;  NETWORKandM;THROUGHPUTandM;PROBLEM: I must increase the bandwidth speeds of my LANs to handle the growthin network traffic generated by distributed-processing systems.andP;  What'savailable?andM;SOLUTION: Look at more efficient varieties of Ethernet and souped-up versionsof tokenring, Arcnet and FDDI for the backbone.andM;Database, printers and other resources are becoming increasingly shared insystems that disperse processing power across departmental networks ofworkstations, host machines and peripherals.andP;  That means more data trafficwithin and between networks and, therefore, more demands on LAN performance.andO;What steps can you take to enhance network speed and efficiency?andM;&quot;If you run into network performance problems, first try to understand wherethe limitation is,&quot; advises Dave Morse, the product marketing manager atHewlett-Packard Co.'s Colorado Networks Division.andP;  &quot;You may not have tochange link speeds to improve performance.&quot;andM;Morse continues with an example: &quot;Ethernet local area networks (LANs) withmany nodes connected directly to the network can be broken up intodepartmental subnetworks.andP;  Bridges from each subnetwork to the backbone thenfilter traffic so that each department sees only the traffic intended for itswork group.&quot;andM;Other options are also possible.andP;  You could, for instance, take a look atimproving efficiency of bandwidth transmission.andP;  Ethernet is defined as a10M-bit-per-second (bps) IEEE 802.3 standard that uses the CSMA/CD accessmethod.andM;But, most current implementations of Ethernet running the transmissioncontrol protocol/internet protocol TCP/IP) deliver bwtween 1M bps and 2M bps,according to Russ Sharer, director of strategic planning and marketingprograms at CMC Corp.andP;  &quot;Ethernet incurs certain overhead problems tht slow itdown,&quot; he says.andM;As to protocol overhead problems, you can add microprocessors dedicated tonetwork processing.andP;  Since Ethernet is a relatively clean medium, try aTCP/IP option that turns off some data-checking algorithms not needed toverify the reliability of packet addresses.andP;  Some early versions of TCP/IPcopied data three or four times as it moved through the network: That can bereduced to further improve network efficiency.andM;And Ethernet, although still the most widely used LAN protocol, isn't theonly game in town.andP;  IBM Corp.'s token ring is available at 16M-bps bandwidth,while Datapoint Corp. is developing a 20M-bps version of its 2.5M-bps,token-bus Arcnet topology called ArcnetPlus.andM;Then there's the 100M-bps Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) standardfor counter-rotating, fiber-optic token rings.andP;  FDDI networks should begintaking their place this year as high-end LANs and wide area network (WAN)backbones.andP;  And it may be possible, even now, to justify bringing fiberdirectly to workstations to handle bandwidth-intensive applications such asvideo-conferencing and imaging transmissions.andM;&quot;While fiber is still expensive, it's much cheaper to install fiber cable innew buildings for future use than to retrofit with fiber down the road,&quot; saysSharer.andP;  &quot;As expense drops, FDDI will move down from high-end applications.andO;We shold see fiber at the desktop by the mid-1990s.&quot;andM;18.andP;  OBJECT-ORIENTEDandM;PROGRAMMINGandM;PROBLEM: Should I throw myself headlong into OOP, since it seems to be thesystems-design direction favored by an increasing number of developers in theCASE, UNIX, distributed computing and other environments?andM;SOLUTION: Don't toss those C and COBOL programs, or retrain your entireprogramming workforce--yet.andP;  It looks like OOP will emerge as a solidprogramming environment for complex commercial and scientific applications.andO;But for now, only the most rudimentary OOP tools are availalble.andP;  And formany applications, traditional thiid- and fourth-generation languages stillfill the bill.andM;What's the optimum object-oriented programming (OOP) technique?andP;  Methodology?andO;Tool?andP;  For that matter, what is an object?andP;  It seems everyone's talkingabout, if not claiming to be using, object-oriented languages and tools todevelop &quot;object-like&quot; or &quot;object-based&quot; systems.andM;Yet, as Chris Stone, director of the standards body Object Management Group,points out: &quot;A commonly accepted definition of object still hasn't beenhammered out.andP;  In addition, object-management standards are still yearsaway.&quot;andP;  That's why OMG is defining common OOP terms, software and services.andM;Many use OOP as a synonym for the ATandamp;T Co.-developed C++ programming language(or one of its many derivatives).andP;  It fact, an ANSI committee is working ondeveloping C++ standard.andP;  But in reality, Actor, Eiffel, Objective-C,Smalltalk and Trellis/Owl, as well as several other languages, also qualifyas OOPs.andM;Definitions to one side, OOP compilers graudally are making their way intothe market.andP;  Almost without exception, early users seem excited by OOP'spossibilities.andM;&quot;C++ will be the language of the future,&quot; says Jim Saudargas, owner ofConcepts in Computing, a machine-control integrator.andP;  Saudargas has alreadywritten a commercial application in Microsoft Corp.'s version of c++.andP;  Whatare the biggest benefits?andP;  &quot;C++ offer portability among DOS, OS/2 and UNIX,&quot;he says.andP;  &quot;You can write code in C++ and port garphics seamlessly acrossoperating systems, without code modification.&quot;andM;&quot;The only real problem,&quot; Saudergas claims, &quot;is the lack of OOP programmingtools.andP;  As a result, people are reluctant to use C++ in a major project.&quot;andP;  Hehas avoided the problem by employing Microsoft C++'s ability to transaltecode into Microsoft C, and then use the available debug and other C tools.andM;Even the biggest systems integrators are limited by the currently anemic OOPdevelopment environment.andP;  Covia's chief information officer, Mark Teflian,elaborates: &quot;Object-oriented programming will be constrained in growth by alack of front-end development tools and the disparateness of exisintoperating systmes.&quot;andM;Nonetheless, Covia has forged ahead with Glockenspiel C++.andP;  And Covia isevaluating a handful of computer aided software engineering (CASE)object-code generators, including CASEWORKS Inc.'s CASE:W (CASE Windows).andO;Teflian says: &quot;The company's next generation of workstation products that itinstalls will be OOP-based and function as multimedia systems.&quot;andP;  But beforethat can happen, he says, &quot;We must look at the inherent conflicts between OOPand CASE.&quot;andM;And even the OOP-bullish Teflian acknowledges that, &quot;There are still lots ofutilities and subsystems services that aren't and won't need to beOOP-based.&quot;andP;  George VanNess, director of Coopers andamp; Lybrand's InofrmationTechnology Group, agrees.andM;&quot;It is not a given that OOP will become standard for all applications,&quot;VanNess points out.andP;  He sees OOP as a sound base for complex, scientificapplications, such as managing CAD/CAM and CASE.andP;  The real question, heclaims, is: &quot;Will the average shop be able to support two different ways ofprogramming [structured and OOP]?andP;  OOP involves a whole new way of thinking.&quot;andO;It not, VanNexx predicts, OOP may become the private domain of computescientists only.andM;19.andP;  ON-LINEandM;TRANSACTIONandM;PROCESSINGandM;PROBLEM: I want to use a standard operating system like UNIX as an engine formy OLTP needs.andP;  UNIX, however, has its problems as an OLTP tool.andP;  What can Ido?andM;SOLUTION: You should take a look at OLTP vendors that are starting to providefixes for UNIX that are designed to make it more suitable for on-linetransaction processing.andM;On-line transaction processing (OLTP) systems are a rapidly growing segmentof the data-processing market, with particularly strong in-roads in thebanking and retail communities.andP;  Proprietary OLTP technologies from companiessuch as Digital Equipment Corp., IBM Corp. and Unisys Corp. havetraditionally led this market.andM;Proprietary products often feature fault tolerance, a requirement ofmission-criticail systems; and system scalability, a technique for boostingthroughtput to accommodate system growth by adding additional processors.andM;UNIX, on the other hand, contains some characteristics that mitigate againstits use in OLTP.andP;  These limitations, for example, involve the operatingsystems' file system.andP;  I/O facilities, data recovery and process scheduling.andO;Fault tolerance and modular growth are also lacking in standard UNIX.andM;Recently, however, a range of vendors, including Sequoia Systems Inc.,andO;Stratus Computer Inc. and Tandem Computers Inc., have offered fault-toleratnOLTP solutions based on UNIX.andM;Why this move to open systems?andP;  &quot;Price/performance and the desire forvendor-independence are key factors,&quot; says, J. Sasidhar, vice president ofDharma Systems Inc., an OLTP software company.andP;  &quot;Products based on opensystems such as UNIX are less expensive than proprietary solutions because ofthe size of the installed UNIX base.andP;  UNIX has achieved extensive use on avariety of platforms.&quot;andM;In addition, Sasidhar points out ways in which UNIX can be adapted to make itmore suitable for OLTP functions.andM;The use of contiguous files solves certain problems posed by the standardUNIX file system for the kind of rapid database access required by OLTP.andO;&quot;the traditional UNIX file is laid out randomly on a disk,&quot; says SAsidhar.andO;&quot;Thus, a lot of disk seeking goes on when you access a file.andP;  When files arelaid out contiguously the data structure used to access files becomes muchmore efficient.&quot;andM;When I/O operations are performed, UNIX writes to the cache, not to a disk.andO;&quot;There's no guarantee that what you've written is really there in case offailure,&quot; says Sasidhar.andP;  &quot;If the system goes down, whatever is in memory islost.andP;  This can be fixed by enhancing the standard UNIX I/O with interfacesthat guarantee information for OLTP applications will be written dirrectly todisk.&quot;andM;20.andP;  OPEN SYSTEMSandM;INTERCONNECTIONandM;PROBLEM: OSI products seem to be coming on line but not to the extent thatI'm willing to junk my present network for full OSI compliance.andP;  What interimstrategies can I follow for migrating to OSI?andM;SOLUTION: A good idea is to look at TCP/IP as a migration path, along withgateways, dual-stack architecture and negotiation protocols.andM;Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), the multilayered, international-standardnetwork architecture, is achieving increasing acceptance as the basicframework for heterogeneous computing environments.andP;  Bull HN InformationSystems Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and IBM Corp. areamong the major manufacturers emphasizing the compliance of their proprietarysystems with evolving OSI standards.andM;But OSI is not yet all here.andP;  The process of specifying and adoptingstandards that implement the OSI architecture is slow, to say the least.andP;  OSIproducts have only recently begun to emerge.andP;  Relatively few such productshave undergone tests of their conformance with OSI standards.andP;  How, then, canyou preserve your investment in existing networks while ensuring your abilityto migrate to OSI?andM;One popular strategy is to use the transmission control protocol/internetprotocol (TCP/IP) as the basis for any migration path.andP;  Two basic approachesare possible, according to Larry Lace, vice president of engineering atNetwork Research Corp. (NRC).andM;(1) The gateway technique interfaces TCP/IP and OSI applications at and abovethe transport layer.andP;  The National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST), for instance, applied NRC transport-layer software to a project thatlinked TCP/IP's File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Simple Mail TransferProtocol (SMTP) to OSI's File Transfer Access and Management Protocol (FTAM)and Message Handling Facility (MHF), respectively.andM;(2) An additional approach that is also underway at NIST, uses a dual-stackarchitecture with gateway capability to run OSI and TCP/IP concurrently.andO;&quot;The dual-stack approach is more difficult and time-consuming to implementthan gateways alone, but it provides faster response time,&quot; says Lace.andP;  Hesuggests that users consider installing the Berkeley UNIX 4.4 release, whichreportedly includes dual architecture and built-in gateways for file and mailtransfer.andM;Hal Lockhart who is senior consultant at Technology Concepts Inc., points inyet another direction.andP;  He says: &quot;TCP/IP is often seen as so similar to TP4,OSI's transport-layer protocol, that people think migration will be easy.andO;But it won't work that way.andP;  I'm more impressed with DEC's efforts to definespecific negotiation protocols at all layers.andP;  This allows two nodes toexchange information about the protocols used for communications.andP;  Then youcan run a mixed network with Digital and OSI protocols simultaneously.&quot;andM;21.andP;  SYSTEMSandM;APPLICATIONandM;ARCHITECTUREandM;PROBLEM: How do I build a new system or convert an existing system so that itwill be SAA-compliant, when IBM still hasn't completely defined all of thecomponents of SAA?andM;SOLUTION: Wait as long as you can for IBM to unveil its strategy in a givenarea.andP;  If you can't wait any longer, wing it--keeping in mind that you mayhave to do some re-engineering later to mesh with IBM's definition.andM;Systems Application Architecture, or SAA, is IBM Corp.'s three-year-oldblueprint designed to make its disparate hardware and software linescompatible.andP;  It is a description of the environments and interfaces withwhich vendors must comply if they plan to operate in conjunction with IBMsystems.andP;  The three primary areas that IBM addresses in its SAAspecifications are: Common User Access (CUA), Common Programming Interface(CPI) and Common Communications Support (CCS).andM;For all three areas, &quot;Compliance issues are at the forefront,&quot; acknowledgesJohn Tibbetts, an SAA expert with the consultancy Kinexis.andP;  Because itsparticulars are the most complete, CUA is the first area that many companieshave attacked, Tibbetts says.andP;  But at least for the early part of the decade,he claims, &quot;CUA compliance will mean only that an application looks likeSAA.&quot;andM;The SAA areas most likely to affect systems integrators directly are the CPIand CCS.andP;  Yet these are the pieces for which details are the sketchiest.andM;&quot;We're waiting for IBM's final word in the areas of higher level SNA [SystemsNetwork Architecture] networking and routing capabilities,&quot; says JerryYochelson, director of research for Systems Strategies Inc., asoftware-products subsidiary of NYNEX Inc.andP;  &quot;Open enterprise networking iscoming, but it's not yet settled for the C world.&quot;andM;Yochelson adds, &quot;We do SAA compliance a piece at a time.andP;  If you try to makesomething SAA-compliant before it's defined by IBM, you may do it wrong andhave to do it all over again.andP;  On the other hand, you can't wait around toolong for them to give you guidance.&quot;andM;Yochelson speaks from experience: Systems Strategies devised an LU 6.2interface for some of its connectivity software, only to have to redesign itlater to be CPI- and CCS-compliant.andM;&quot;Plus, open standards for C aren't there yet,&quot; Yochelson continues.andP;  &quot;Openenterprise networking is coming, but it's not yet settled for the C world.&quot;andM;&quot;Because all the pieces aren't in place, SAA is a moving target,&quot; agrees JoeForehand of the consulting division of Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.andP;  Andersen istrying to get a better handle on SAA by working with it in-house at itsLogistics 2000 integration center in Atlanta.andM;At the center, which is slated to open in May, Andersen will demonstrate itsFoundation product line.andP;  Andersen says that these homegrown CASE (computeraided software enginerring) tools are an SAA-compliant alternative to thoseoffered by IBM as part of its AD/Cycle CASE strategy.andM;Andersen's main reason for rolling its own solution: SAA doesn't encompassconnectivity to or coexistence with other vendors' platforms.andP;  Andersen'sFoundation tools made their debut on the Digital Equipment Corp. VAXarchitecture, yet have maintained IBM compatibility.andM;One of the most glaring SAA gaps is the whole realm of compliance testing.andO;Currently, IBM is leaving compliance testing solely up to developers.andP;  Forguidance, it has provided only a 32-item checklist.andP;  The result?andP;  All kindsof vendors are claiming SAA-compatibility, but there's no telling exactlywhat this distinction means.andM;22.andP;  3-D GRAPHICSandM;PROBLEM: My customers want 3-D graphics on PCs, but they squawk at the price.andM;SOLUTION: Sell price/performance.andP;  THe new breed of add-in boards andpowerful low-priced 3-D workstations bring your customers the power of muchbigger, more expensive systems.andM;Show your customers the X/Series from Vermont Microsystems Inc. (VMI).andP;  Itsboards, going for $3,000 to $7,000 each, bring the price of a host personalcomputer (PC) up to about $20,000.andP;  But VMI says the performance rivals thatof a $100,000-class workstation like the Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) Iris.andM;Meanwhile, the big guns, like SGI, are fighting back in the price wars.andP;  SGIwas the first to offer a low-price 3-D workstation, the Personal Iris, with abase price of $15,900.andM;Until recently, according to Drew Davis, vice president of marketing atMicrosource CAD/CAM Inc., a VAR for CAD products, there was little incentivefor design engineers to work in 3-D, because there was no easy way to get the3-D model onto a 2-D drawing.andP;  &quot;At least in the DOS environment,&quot; Davis says,&quot;they didn't have functions like automatic hidden-line removal orfull-function surfacing.&quot;andM;But that situation is changing.andP;  &quot;We're starting to see thesemodel-to-drawing automation tools in products like Computervision Corp.'sPersonal Designer,&quot; Davis says.andP;  He tells his customers to look into 3-Dproducts, now.andM;Remember:  A big part of the installation price of a 3-D system is thetraining cost.andP;  Many vendors of 3-D boards for PCs estimate $1,000 to $3,000and 40 to 80 hours to train each user.andP;  The cost and training time areusually less if the user knows 2-D systems.andM;23.andP;  UNIXandM;PROBLEM: In the case of multivendor, cross-platform installations, how can Iget the many different versions of UNIX to interoperate?andM;SOLUTION: Focus on running the same tools, user interfaces and applicationson all UNIX platforms, so they share at least the same &quot;look and feel.&quot;andP;  Butdon't take upon yourself the Herculean task of making the different UNIXescompatible.andM;Don't let the standards bodies fool you: Even if you adhere religiously tothe &quot;standards&quot; offered by the Open Software Foundation or UNIX InternationalInc., you're still likely to have UNIX-compatibility problems.andM;&quot;UNIX comes in 31 flavors, just like Baskin-Robbins [ice cream],&quot; quipsGeorge VanNEss, director of the Information Technology Group for Coopers andamp;Lybrand.andP;  Full-blown UNIX implementations, geared to run on mainframes andminis, by their nature contain a lot of code not found in PC-based UNIXes.andO;And the version from UNIX author ATandamp;T Co. is not automatically compatiblewith the Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. or any of the othercustomized UNIXes.andM;That's one reason why systems integrators have tried to keep UNIXinstallations single-vendor and single-platform shops.andP;  Coopers andamp; Lybrandaspires to this approach.andM;&quot;As much as we can, we go one-dimensional, so that we can go with a singlevendor's UNIX variation,&quot; VanNess acknowledges.andP;  &quot;We get around it (UNIXincompatibility) by trying not to have the same application running on thesame network on multiple types of machines.&quot;andM;If your require more than one vendor's equipment--and most installations dothese days--your best bet is to insulate yourself from the harsh realities ofthe UNIX operating system.andP;  This insulation can take many forms, ranging fromgraphical user interfaces (GUIs) to desktop managers, common databases andother cross-platform UNIX applications.andM;Says VanNess, &quot;We use products that filter us from UNIX--like Ingres, thedatabase system from Ingress Corp.andP;  We use it as a layer between us and theoperating system.&quot;andM;Wilfred Becker, a vice president with Management Concepts Inc., a health careintegrator, agrees:  &quot;We need UNIX shells to make the transition easierbetween UNIXes, as well as between UNIX and other operating systems.&quot;andP;  Beckermentions HP's NewWave interface as one possibility.andM;UNIX interfaces are good, admits Frank Kacerek, a program director with TheUltimate Corp., a UNIX and Pick Systems' VAR.andP;  But these products won'tbecome widely accepted &quot;standards&quot; for a few more years, he predicts.andP;  In themeantime, Ultimate programmers are &quot;front-ending automatic procedures andscripts to hide more of UNIX from the user&quot;--in other words, writing theirown shells, Kacerek says.andM;The phenomenon of individual hardware vendors' developing and marketingtailor-made UNIX versions isn't a problem, Kacerek claims.andP;  In fact, UNIXneeds to be even less general-purpose than it is today.andP;  &quot;Users in thecommercial market, for example, don't need all the UNIX options that those inthe technical market do,&quot; claims Kacerek.andM;One way around this: Develop and support a handful of UNIXes customized forparticular vertical markets, instead of for horizontal, single-vendormarkets.andP;  Some type of real-time UNIX, for instance, would be welcomed byboth manufacturing and on-line transaction-processing specialists.andM;24.andP;  USER INTERFACESandM;PROBLEM: How do I choose a UNIX-based user interface?andP;  Or should I supportthem all?andM;SOLUTION: If you have the money and development resources, support as many aspossible.andP;  If not, concentrate on the API, not the look-and-feel aspects ofthe user interface, and try to protect your existing applications.andM;The split of the UNIX market into two opposing camps offering two different&quot;standards&quot; (UNIX System V.4 and OSF/1) is causing problems in the systemsintegration community.andP;  In the case of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), youmust choose between System V.4's Open Look and OSF/1's Motif (not to mentionvarious proprietary GUIs).andP;  The alternative is to support them both, whichmight double your development time.andM;&quot;What the user interface actually looks like is of secondary concern to us,&quot;says Bill Scott, a graphics software engineer with systems integrator ESystems Inc.andP;  &quot;The application programming interface (API) is much morecritical to us than the look-and-feel.&quot;andP;  APIs enable software developers towrite to a standard set of windowing system calls.andM;Currently, Motif has an edge in the systems integration arena.andP;  Scott: &quot;We'veadopted Motif and we're looking at adopting Open Look.&quot;andM;E Systems prefers the Motif toolkit, but that's not the only reason thecompany adopted Motif.andP;  In addition to UNIX, E Systems develops a lot ofsoftware for Digital Equipment Corp.'s VMS operating system.andP;  And becauseDEC--via its DECwindows user interface--has adopted Motif, E Systems will gowith Motif in order to maintain compatibility with the code it's alreadywritten.andM;E Systems has also developed code on workstations from Sun Microsystems Inc.andM;Scott says: &quot;We'll probably also support Open Look, because some areas of ourcompany are using Suns so they'll probably continue developing unde XView.&quot;andO;XView is an Open Look-compliant version of Sun's SunView user interface.andP;  Themaintain compatibility with SunView applications, E Systems will probably optfor Open Look.andM;Bear in mind that you can do future applications-development work under Motifon UNIX machines from vendors that don't endorse Motif, such as Sun.andM;If you're eager to develop GUI-based UNIX applications, you'll have to choosebetween Motif and Open Look if, of course, you can't support both.andP;  If youhave to bet on one, put your money on Motif.andP;  Most analysts, such asWorkGroup Technologies Inc.'s (Hampton, N.H.) Chuck Barney, predict thatMotif will win the user interface battle.andM;In the future, the differences between the two GUIs may dissolve, at least atthe API level.andP;  For example: ATandamp;T Co. is developing a common API that willcomply with both Motif and Open Look.andM;25.andP;  X TERMINALSandM;PROBLEM: How do I obtain the benefits of the X Window System on my desktop ina client-server network without also incurring the high cost of a graphicsworkstation?andM;SOLUTION: Look at the new X terminals that are arriving in the marketplace.andM;Vendors of the emerging X terminal technology are pursuing an increasingshare of the action in the office network computing arena.andP;  And, at the sametime, this technology is giving a shot in the arm to data processing managerswho see their role reduced in the desktop era.andM;X terminals use MIT's X Window System on the desktop, gaining such advantagesas simultaneous display of graphics, spreadsheets and electronic mail.andP;  Acentral computer takes over the computing function.andP;  X terminal users canalso use a mouse pointer.andP;  X terminals are the 1990's version of the dumbterminal.andM;And X terminal pioneer Judy Estrin, executive vice president of startupNetwork Computing Devices Inc. says: &quot;Prior to the X terminal, there was agap.andP;  You could spend $5,000 or more for a graphics workstation that gave youwindows or buy just an ASCII terminal.&quot;andP;  Right now, X terminal price tags arearound $2,500.andM;Estrin says that her company's product can access the 80486 microprocessorbut is based on the 68000 and 68020.andM;Software vendors who cater to the X terminal technology include FrameTechnology Inc., maker of FrameMaker.andM;Frame's vice president Steve Kirsch maintains, &quot;There is no doubt that the Xterminal will make a significant impact in the 1990s.andP;  All the UNIXmanufacturers have standardized on the X Window System.andP;  X terminal is aninexpensive way of putting computing power on everyone's desk.andM;&quot;We are going back to centralized computing, in a sense.andP;  Realistically, weare changing the definition of distributed computing where .andP;  .  .  anapplication can be on a terminal and a server down the hall or in the remotecorporate mainframe.&quot;andM;But the X terminal is not without its detractors.andP;  They claim most tellinglythat X terminals simply lack the power of the best available graphicslanguages.andP;  Then there is the complaint that you can't as easily produceadvanced graphics with the X terminal as you can with the better class ofpersonal computers (PCs) and workstations.andM;And, add the critics, the X terminal's centralized computing is subject tothe slows when many users are simultaneously working.andP;  Furthermore, they say,it is difficult to customize software.andM;Still, look to Digital Equipment Corp. and IBM Corp. to shortly follow Xterminal pacemakers Network Computing Devices and Acer Technologies Corp.andM;&quot;Systems integrators,&quot; says Estrin, &quot;are faced with a lot of architecturaloptions: work groups, PCs, X terminal, etc.andP;  The main thing is that they nottake a certain type of solution for granted, just because they're used toit.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
