SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney plans to moveahead with building five B-2 stealth bombers next fiscal year buthas not decided on the fate of the full 132-plane, $70 billionprogram in later years, Pentagon officials said today.   Cheney's decision came as he was putting the final touches onthe defense budget for fiscal 1991, which is due to be submitted tothe White House in the coming days for final review before going toCongress in January. The year begins Oct. 1, 1990.   ``Five (planes) is right for '91, but there's been no decisionmade on the out-years,'' said one source, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Amid the reforms under way in the Soviet Union and the politicalchanges in Eastern Europe, congressional critics of theradar-evading bomber have ridiculed the idea that the full numberof planes would ever be built.   But Cheney has stressed throughout the budget process that heprefers to cut entire weapons programs, rather than stretching themout over longer production periods _ which makes each unit morecostly.   The advanced technology bomber is designed to replace the AirForce's aging B-52 strategic bomber fleet.   The Los Angeles Times reported in today's editions that Cheneyhad decided to build five bombers in 1991, 10 in 1992, 21 in 1993and 24 in 1994. The rest would be completed by fiscal year 1996,the newspaper said.   Officials said later, however, that no such decision has beenmade.   ``Mr. Cheney has not reached any decision on his plans for anyprograms in the out-years,'' said Defense Department spokesman PeteWilliams.   Williams refused to discuss any of Cheney's plans for the 1991budget, but he noted that the secretary has backed the long-rangebomber program as an essential part of the nation's strategicdefense.   The Pentagon has invested about $23 billion in the program andhad expressed hopes of purchasing 132 bombers at a cost of about$70 billion.   But the price of the plane produced ``sticker shock'' inCongress when lawmakers learned the price tag could be in the rangeof $530 million for a single plane.   Cheney's decision to move ahead with the program for a singleyear comes as the Air Force recommended that the production bestretched out over a longer period of time.   Under the 1990 budget signed by Bush last month, the Congressappropriated $4.5 billion for the program, and provided money tobuild two in that fiscal year. Plans also called for funds forcomponents for five more of the radar-evading, bat-winged aircraftin 1991.   The Pentagon has proposed spending about $24 billion over athree-year peak period for the bomber _ $7.8 billion in fiscal1992, $8.4 billion in fiscal 1993 and $7.7 billion in fiscal 1994.   Air Force Secretary Donald Rice told reporters last week that hewas looking at plans to extended purchases of the planes beyondprevious deadlines to meet budgetary constraints and prevent cutsto other Air Force programs.   Air Force officials have begun studying conventional-weaponsroles for the B-2 as its original mission _ delivering nuclearweapons to Soviet targets _ comes under question with warmingsuperpower relations.   Bombers equipped with long-range missiles with conventionalwarheads could be used to strike terrorist targets or supportlimited Navy operations, the officials say.</TEXT></DOC>
