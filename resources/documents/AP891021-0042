Robert Garcia became the second congressmanconvicted in the Wedtech scandal when he and his wife were foundguilty of extortion and conspiracy for taking bribes andinterest-free loans from the company.   The federal jury said Friday that Robert and Jane Lee Garciaconspired to obtain $175,000 in payments, and a $1,900 emerald anddiamond necklace for Mrs. Garcia, from 1984 to 1986, in exchangefor Garcia's political influence in helping the now-defunctmilitary contractor get government business.   The Democrat and his wife were acquitted of bribery and receiptsof illegal gratuities.   ``The verdict shows that the jury can see through sophisticatedmethods used by politicians to sell political influence,'' said thelead prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Little.   Another Bronx congressman, former Rep. Mario Biaggi, wasconvicted in a Wedtech racketeering case last year and sentenced toeight years in prison.   Others convicted in the Wedtech scandal were E. Robert Wallach,a friend of ex-U.S. Attorney Edwin Meese, former Bronx boroughpresident Stanley Simon and Wedtech founder John Mariotta.   The Garcias face up to five years in prison on the conspiracycharge and up to 20 years on each of two counts of extortion.   Sentencing was set for Jan. 5. Ronald Fischetti, a lawyer forJane Lee Garcia, said the verdict would be appealed.   As the jury forewoman read off the first guilty verdict, Garciareached over and squeezed his wife's hand. Afterward, he appearedshaken and his voice broke when he read a prepared statement toreporters.   ``My faith in God remains strong, so I remain strong,'' saidGarcia, the son of a Pentecostal minister. He recalled a song hesang in church: ``In the good times, you praise His name. In thebad times, you do the same.''   Garcia, 56, didn't announce if he intended to give up his seat,which he has held since 1978.   ``In the next few weeks, I will be consulting with my politicaladvisers and the Democratic Party leaders about the best way of mypreserving the interests of my constituents,'' he said.   Garcia doesn't automatically lose his House seat. TheConstitution gives each chamber of Congress sole authority fordisciplining its members.   Under House rules, a convicted member is urged, but notrequired, to abstain from voting in committee or on the floorunless he is later cleared of wrongdoing or is re-elected to hisseat. After being indicted, Garcia was effectively stripped of thechairmanship of the banking subcommittee on policy, research andinsurance.   The Garcias' month-long trial was the seventh to stem from thewide-ranging scandal at Wedtech, the small South Bronx machine shopthat grew into a multimillion-dollar defense contractor throughvarious bribe schemes.   The company collapsed in 1986 amid allegations of corruption.   One extortion charge against the Garcias dealt with $76,000allegedly funneled by Wedtech through an attorney in Puerto Rico toMrs. Garcia's consulting firm, Leesonia Enterprises, in numerouspayments between 1984 and 1986.   The attorney, Ralph Vallone Jr., a close friend of Mrs. Garcia,was charged with the Garcias but was severed from the trial forhealth reasons.   The other extortion charge was for a $20,000 no-interest loanGarcia received from Wedtech in 1985. Testimony showed Garciainstructed Wedtech to make the loan to his sister, who transferredthe money to Mrs. Garcia.   The conspiracy count also included a $77,500 investmentMariotta's wife made in a Benetton store Mrs. Garcia wanted to openin Puerto Rico; another $1,500 loan from Wedtech to Garcia; and thenecklace, which Mariotta bought for Mrs. Garcia the day after theGarcias set up a 1985 meeting between Wedtech officials and Gov.Rafael Hernandez-Colon of Puerto Rico.</TEXT></DOC>
