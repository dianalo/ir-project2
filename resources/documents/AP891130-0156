Mrs. Aquino vowed to smash the ``shameless and naked attempt,''one of the most serious since a civilian-military uprising swepther to power in February 1986 and forced the late PresidentFerdinand E. Marcos into exile.   A T-28 aircraft dropped two bombs in the compound of MalacanangPalace at about 6:30 a.m. (5:30 p.m. EST Thursday) and presidentialguards responded with small arms fire.   ``They're bombing us!'' a palace staff member cried over thetelephone. ``We're going down!''   Lourdes Sytangco, the deputy presidential spokeswoman, said Mrs.Aquino was safe. Ms. Sytangco said she could not give a damagereport because no one could leave the building.   Radio station DZRH, reporting from the palace, said three peoplewere killed.   The government appealed to all mayors to mobilize local policeforces, and Mrs. Aquino asked Filipinos earlier Friday to ``supportour democracy in this hour of challenge.''   ``An attempt to seize power by force is again being made at thismoment,'' she said in a nationally televised address. ``Our forceshave the situation under control. We shall smash this shameless andnaked attempt once more.''   ``This nation must never be allowed to fall unto the hand oftyrants,'' she said. ``God is with us and we shall prevail. Thosewho wish to be kings are here once more, despite repeatedrejections by the people.''   Cardinal Jaime Sin, Roman Catholic archbishop of Manila, urgedhis countrymen ``to support the duly constituted authority'' andthe soldiers to end their rebellion ``in the name of God.''   Gen. Renato de Villa, military chief of staff, acknowleged thatrebels had seized Villamor Air Base, headquarters of the Philippineair force; the government broadcast center; a private televisionstation; and the Ninoy Aquino International Airport.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said U.S.officials had only sketchy information and ``we're watching itclosely. ... We're very concerned about it and we continue tosupport the democratically elected government of Mrs. Aquino.''   There was no indication who was leading the mutiny, and rebelsoldiers would not say. They were believed loyal to renegade Lt.Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, who led an August 1987 coupattempt in which at least 53 people were killed.   Soon after dawn, pro-government troops opened fire withrecoilless rifles on rebels near the government broadcast centerand rebels returned the fire, blocking the road with trucks. Nocasualty reports were available.   Scattered shooting was reported at Villamor, near the airport.Soldiers sealed off several of Manila's main avenues.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said the rebellion began shortlyafter midnight when about 200 Marines tried to enter Villamor.About two hours later, air force troops who had been guarding thegate left their posts and mutinous Marines took over security atthe base perimeter.   Rebels fired heavy weapons at the headquarters of the 205thHelicopter Wing, setting fire to the building.   One Marine captain, who refused to give his name, said about2,000 troops were involved in the sixth attempt to overthrow Mrs.Aquino since she took office.   Truckloads of mutineers, wearing white arm bands and carryingred flags, entered the government radio and television station andthe adjacent private station ABS-CBN. Pro-government troopssurrounded the compound, but later withdrew, and the mutineersallowed civilian staff to leave.   The significance of the red and white colors was not clear.   After sunrise Friday, rebel troops deployed along the majorexpressway leading to southeastern Luzon.   Honasan escaped from prison last year and remains at large. Hegave clandestine interviews about a week ago warning Mrs. Aquino ofimpending trouble.   Reinforcements took up positions during the night around Mrs.Aquino's residence and her office at nearby Malacanang Palace.Tanks and trucks blocked the main street that runs by the palace.   De Villa told reporters late Thursday mutineers apparentlyplanned a full-scale coup attempt Friday, ``and for this reason Ihave placed all units in the affected areas in full alert status.''   He said the plot was discovered after 13 members of the army'selite Scout Rangers late Wednesday sabotaged two communicationstransmitters 30 miles south of Manila.   Col. Jesus Ranjo, chief of staff of the National Capital RegionDefense Command, said all 13 were in custody at Fort Bonifacio,headquarters of the Philippine army. Ranjo said three otherofficers were being sought.   According to De Villa, the plot included plans to seize MactanInternational Airport in Cebu, 350 miles south of Manila, and mayhave involved units in central Luzon and northern Mindanao.   Rumors of a new coup attempt swept Manila last month after adispute over plans to reorganize the Philippine Constabulary.   Congress is considering a proposal to abolish the Constabulary,a branch of the armed forces, and replace it with acivilian-controlled national police.   Constabulary generals would be barred from joining the newforce. Constabulary troops have staged protests in Manila and Cebuagainst the reorganization plan.   Public discontent with the Aquino government has been growingbecause of rising prices, a critical shortage of electricity inManila, allegations of corruption and the deterioration of thecity's transport system.   Honasan's coup attempt in August 1987 was the bloodiest and mostdangerous of the half-dozen revolts against Mrs. Aquino. Thecolonel played a key role in the military mutiny that started theuprising against Marcos, who died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28.   He became disenchanted with Mrs. Aquino, however, accusing herof failing to crush Communist rebels and rid the government ofcorruption.   He was arrested in December 1987, but escaped from a prison shipin Manila Bay the next April.</TEXT></DOC>
