Terry Deeks, president of Navigators Group Inc., a New York marine-insurance underwriter, calls Piper Alpha &quot;the most important single loss in the past 10 or 20 years.&quot; He adds: &quot;It's going to have a very big effect.&quot;    At the bustling Lloyd's insurance market, David Beaumont, an underwriter of Piper Alpha policies, says his reinsurance costs are skyrocketing since the July 6 North Sea explosion. Scrambling to renew coverage for another year, Mr. Beaumont faces price increases of as much as 300% on some policies. &quot;I have never seen anything like it,&quot; he says.    The explosion aboard Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s oil platform cost 167 lives, an appalling human loss. History's worst offshore oil disaster also is sending shock waves through the insurance business. The industry anticipated higher premiums, but only now is it becoming clear how much higher.    The tragedy is prompting significantly higher prices in the offshore-reinsurance market, a leading indicator of activity in primary markets. The biggest impact is on North Sea coverage, already among the marine industry's costliest because of harsh weather. Piper Alpha claims will wipe out more than a year's income from London insurers' offshore policies, brokers say, and likely will reduce underwriting capacity during this autumn's heavy renewal season, when oil companies extend rig coverage.    Some oil companies expect a 20% to 25% increase in offshore-insurance costs. They will attempt to pass at least part of that to consumers and boost efforts to insure themselves through so-called captive insurers they established to underwrite their own risks, insurance executives say. Price increases also may spread to general marine and some non-marine liability policies, as underwriters try to cover offshore losses.    In addition to raising premiums, Lloyd's Mr. Wingett now expects insurers to increase deductibles and restrictions on offshore coverage. The insurance director at one of the world's biggest oil companies, who asks not to be identified because he will soon negotiate policy renewals, believes Piper Alpha will raise his company's offshore premiums 25%. That will boost insurance charges to 19% of annual operating costs for a typical platform from 15%. While he doesn't see an immediate boost in pump prices, &quot;it will increase overhead and narrow margins.&quot;    Hundreds of insurance-market participants face Piper Alpha losses totaling an estimated $1.4 billion, says Lloyd's. Roughly half will be paid by Lloyd's investors, who face unlimited liability for losses in return for premium and investment income.    Because insurers spread their risks by buying reinsurance, no single group appears to be facing an overwhelming hit. &quot;While this is a large loss, it is perfectly sustainable and not one that is going to give the market pause,&quot; says a Lloyd's spokesman.    Another estimated 10% to 20% will fall on United Kingdom insurers, and the rest is spread among the U.S., Scandinavian and Mideast markets. &quot;The London market is being hit hardest, but the Scandinavian insurance market will take a pretty good chunk, and the U.S. will be affected as well,&quot; says Forrest Downing, a vice president for field underwriting at Cigna Corp.    Cigna says it expects to pay $8.5 million to $9 million in Piper Alpha claims, an amount Mr. Downing considers &quot;a pinprick for us.&quot; Nonetheless, Cigna briefed securities analysts last week on the loss. Among U.S. insurers, Prudential Insurance Co. of America estimates its Piper Alpha exposure at $3 million.    Perhaps the biggest single provider of coverage for Piper Alpha is OIL Insurance Ltd., a Bermuda-based insurer bankrolled by 49 oil companies, which provides Occidental with $300 million of coverage. Occidental says other policies cover it for claims above that amount. An Occidental Petroleum vice president, Frank Ashley, says: &quot;We have property insurance in excess of $500 million and we have liability insurance in excess of $300 million. All of this insurance continues in full force and effect. We cannot give you more information as we are in negotiation on some of these matters with the insurance carriers.&quot;    Units of Texaco Inc., Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc. and International Thomson PLC, which also owned stakes in Piper Alpha, have their own coverage.    OIL Insurance's president, Doyle Stephens, says he was able to lay off some of his company's exposure beforehand by reinsurance, and &quot;we'll have no problem paying&quot; claims. But he says he doesn't yet know exactly how much OIL Insurance might be liable for itself. Insurance-industry sources say the claim could considerably dent OIL Insurance's nearly $1 billion of capital and surplus.    The first claims are expected in a few days, and are likely to be paid within a week of settlement, Lloyd's says. Most of the initial claims will cover the $790 million loss of the platform, which virtually disintegrated in a series of explosions.    The remainder, which could take months to process and pay, will cover hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses for controlling well fires and pollution and removing the charred wreck. Union Texas also has $275 million in business-interruption insurance.    The biggest uncertainties surround liability claims and possible compensation to families of victims. Occidental has had preliminary talks with a survivors' group, and both sides express hope about a settlement. Occidental is expected to propose its settlement around the end of this month. At that stage, families may either accept the offer, pursue cases in the British courts, or in the U.S., where awards often are higher.    Typical British awards might run #500,000 ($848,250) a victim, says New York attorney Stuart Speiser, who advises some Piper Alpha families. But in the U.S., he says, the award for the estate of a 35-year-old worker with two surviving children, wife and parents might reach $5 million. Mr. Speiser's calculations suggest the liability for workers could run from less than $100 million to more than $500 million.    Meantime, the loss has left some executives wondering what will follow. Jonathan S. Gilbert, chairman of Sedgwick Group PLC's Offshore Resources Ltd. brokerage unit in London, notes that little more than halfway through 1988, offshore insurers face &quot;a billion {dollar} loss and a $330 million loss&quot; from an April explosion aboard Brazil's Enchova rig.    &quot;If we were to have a series of major hurricanes,&quot; he adds, &quot;that would change an extremely serious situation into calamity.&quot;    ---              Worst Losses From Man-Made Disasters    DATE            EVENT                     AMOUNT    July 6, 1988    Piper Alpha North Sea     $1.4 billion*                    oil-rig explosion    March 28, 1979  Three Mile Island         $440 million                    nuclear accident    June 3, 1979    Ixtoc-I Gulf of Mexico    $350 million                    oil-rig explosion    Nov. 14, 1987   Gas-platform explosion    $337.5 million                    Pampa, Texas    April 23, 1988  Enchova, Brazil,          $330 million*                    gas-platform explosion    *Estimated    Source: Swiss Reinsurance Co., Zurich, Lloyd's of London</TEXT></DOC>
