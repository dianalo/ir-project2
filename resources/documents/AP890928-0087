I've worked with computers.''   She is going by the name Kitty, ``but it might have been anickname,'' she said.   ``At this point I don't know my Social Security number,'' shesaid. ``I can't work without one or do anything. I'm stuck inlimbo. I have to do something to get along with the rest of mylife.''   The woman is slightly overweight, has a Midwestern accent andhas a scar from a hysterectomy, police said.   ``She's fairly intelligent and she's kind of neat to talk to,''police Lt.

The National Crime Information Center checked herfingerprints and determined she has no criminal record.   Bonnie Grauman, assistant director of the Family Life Centerwhere the woman stays, said the woman is ``quiet and she gets alongwell with other people who stay here.
