Will Abandon   Major Facility   ---   Defense Contractor to Pull   All Aircraft Operations   Out of Burbank, Calif.   ----   By Rick Wartzman   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/09/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A4</SO><CO>   LK LABOR</CO><IN>AEROSPACE (ARO)ENVIRONMENT (ENV)</IN><LP>   BURBANK, Calif. -- Faced with a dearth of Pentagon workand a need to cut costs, Lockheed Corp. decided to pull allaircraft operations out of this city, where its founder beganbuilding six-passenger plywood transports 62 years ago.   The news, which shocked union representatives and Burbankofficials, was painted by the big defense contractor asanother sign of troubled times for the industry. A year ago,Lockheed announced it planned eventually to stop assemblingplanes here, but the new moves also call for clearing outadministrative and engineering staffs and discontinuingtesting.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Our work base has been falling off faster than ourability&quot; to shrink, Lockheed Chairman Daniel Tellep said.   With the exodus from Burbank, the company's entireaircraft business would be in Marietta, Ga., and Palmdale,Calif., a 45-minute drive north of here in the high desert.Vacated and put on the market would be all 320 acres ofBurbank land, which could fetch $1 million an acre or more.Most Burbank property will be emptied by 1991, Mr. Tellepsaid. The company already had planned to sell 225 of theacres here and move its supersecret Skunk Works operation,creator of the U-2 and SR-71 spyplanes, to Palmdale by 1994.Before any land can be sold, Lockheed must settle certainenvironmental issues with the city; Mr. Tellep said thosematters should be resolved by early next year.   &quot;It's a sad day because it really all began in Burbank forLockheed,&quot; said William Schoneberger, a local aviationhistorian and author of &quot;California Wings.&quot;   Lockheed can't say how deeply employment will be cut untilthere is a clearer picture of what future Pentagon work itwill perform. The company spearheads a team competing tobuild the Air Force's next-generation jet fighter, and isworking out with the Navy a production schedule for the P-7anti-submarine aircraft. Both those projects faceconsiderable delays, and with the improvement in superpowerrelations, Lockheed will have a hard time finding products toreplace the C-5B cargo plane, P-3 sub hunter, TR-1reconnaissance plane and F-117A Stealth fighter.   Currently, about 10,500 people work for Lockheed inBurbank, a third of whom are Machinists members. Lockheed,which in 1986 moved its headquarters to the outlying LosAngeles suburb of Calabasas from here, employs a total of81,000. The company indicated that it would relocatethousands in Palmdale, and several hundred in Georgia, overthe next few years.   But plenty of pink slips could be handed out. Late lastmonth, Lockheed said it would lay off 2,750 at itsaircraft-making unit by the end of June, and the move fromBurbank may mean more cutting. &quot;Given the currentenvironment, it would be difficult for any company to saythat this is the end of trimming the work force,&quot; Mr. Tellepsaid. Job losses elsewhere have been rampant, with GeneralElectric Co. announcing elimination of 4,200 aerospace postsand General Dynamics Corp. saying it could slash rolls by7,000 at its Texas fighter plant by the mid-1990s.   In Burbank, Machinists leaders were taken aback. &quot;We'regoing to fight this action, either by legal means or with thehelp of some of our political friends,&quot; said Don Nakamoto,spokesman for District Lodge 727. Added Burbank Mayor ThomasFlavin: &quot;We will do everything we can to encourage them tostay, but, frankly, I don't know what we can offer.&quot;   Mr. Tellep said that &quot;to ease the sting,&quot; Lockheed willgive veteran employees extra benefits if they retire early.Leaving Burbank, he said, is ultimately &quot;the way to preservethe most for the most people.&quot;   The chairman predicted that the change will drive downoperating costs by more than $50 million a year, while paring$75 million from capital spending through 1994. In addition,he said, some overhead expenses will evaporate as Lockheedleaves behind 2.3 million square feet of Burbank factory, ontop of the 3.3 million it already is trying to shed.   Under a new arrangement Lockheed's board approvedyesterday, aircraft operations will now break into twodistinct operating companies, each reporting financialresults independently to Mr. Tellep. The companies togetherwill still be known as the Aeronautical Systems Group, butheadquarters will be in Marietta. In fact, the departure fromBurbank is sure to be a boon for the Atlanta suburb, whereLockheed employment has dwindled to about 10,000 from 20,000over the past 2 1/2 years. Lockheed's work on the Air Force'sAdvanced Tactical Fighter, as part of a team with GeneralDynamics and Boeing Co., also will move there.   When the lights go out at the vast Burbank facilities,leaving Lockheed with only two small, non-aircraft unitshere, an important chapter in aviation history will end. Thecompany's founder, Allan Loughead -- who later changed hisname to Lockheed to match its pronunciation -- moved here in1928 to give him and partner Jack Northrop more room to churnout their plywood Vega plane. Since then, nearly 35,000aircraft have been built in Burbank.</TEXT></DOC>
