Petroleum markets remained cautiously optimistic about thechances for the cartel reaching an agreement to limit its output,however, as prices rose for a second day although prices again swungwildly.   The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesrecessed its formal talks after a brief session Monday, optinginstead for small, private meetings. The full plenary session wasrescheduled for Thursday.   ``We're working towards (an agreement),'' said OPEC PresidentRilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's oil minister.   He said the ministers were still trying to resolve the disputebetween Iran and Iraq that has stalled an overall agreement. Iraq,which fought Iran in an 8-year war that ended in August, has beenseeking a production quota equal to Iran's, but its former foe hasadamantly opposed parity.   Lukman met for lunch with Oil Ministers Hisham Nazer of SaudiArabia, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi of Iraq and GinandjarKartasasmita of Indonesia.   Afterward, al-Chalabi quipped, ``We're always near an agreement,but how near I cannot tell.''   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark grade of U.S. crude, ended the day at $13.97 a barrel, up11 cents after trading as much as 74 cents above Tuesday's close.The price had soared more than $1.40 on Tuesday before finishing up88 cents.   Oil brokers said trading was relatively light Wednesday inadvance of a four-day Thanksgiving Day holiday.   The oil ministers are trying to fashion a new productionagreement that would reduce the world oil glut and help raise crudeprices.   ``There is an arrangement in (the) works but I don't know whenthe work is going to be completed,'' said Mana Saeed Otaiba,petroleum minister for the United Arab Emirates during a stroll inthe chilly Vienna weather.   ``I think we have to finish before the end of the week. There'sno reason to stay longer,'' he said.   In addition to settling the dispute between Iran and Iraq, theministers also are trying to decide how much oil the cartel as awhole should produce to keep prices at a profitable level.   Although several OPEC members have stepped up their production,oil revenue has declined because of the slump in prices, which havebeen running about 25 percent below OPEC's goal of $18 a barrel.   Julien M'Pouho Epigat, Gabon's minister of hydrocarbons, saidOPEC members were focusing on two possible ceilings for total output_ 18.5 million barrels a day and 19 million barrels.   M'Pouho Epigat said an accord that held production to 18.5million barrels would result in prices ranging between $15 and $18 abarrel.   Otaiba also said that a cap of 18.5 million barrels a day fortotal production ``is what they are talking about.''   But, Lukman, when asked about such a ceiling, said, ``Soundsgood, but (it's) not necessarily the right one (number).''   The new production accord would replace a 2-year-old agreementthat set a ceiling of 15 million a barrels a day for 12 of OPEC'smembers. Iraq was not included because it refused to abide by aquota that was less than Iran's.   Despite that agreement, OPEC's members are estimated to beproducing more than 20 million barrels a day.   Iraq argues it needs a quota as big as Iran's because it needsrevenue to rebuild an economy shattered by their long war.   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh has repeatedy toldreporters he would never agree to parity with Iraq.   Aghazadeh offered to allow Iraq ``export parity,'' which wouldgive the two countries the same total for overseas sales. He saidthe more populous Iran should retain a bigger overall quota becauseof its higher internal demand for oil.   Aghazadeh said Iran's share of total OPEC output be maintained atthe current level of 13.5 percent, second after Saudi Arabia's 25.6percent. Iraq's share is third at 11.7 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
