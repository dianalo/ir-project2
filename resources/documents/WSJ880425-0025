Browning (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST EUROP GOVMT </CO><IN> MON IND </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The arrest last week of four current and former French machine-tool executives marks the uncovering of another potentially serious scandal involving illicit exports of Western technology to the Soviet Union.    A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry characterized the arrests as &quot;serious,&quot; but wouldn't elaborate. The four were charged under a French counterespionage law that carries a maximum 20-year sentence; they could have been charged with less serious offenses.    Sources said the case involves the illegal export of sophisticated machinery that helped the Soviets produce in mass quantities turbine blades for advanced jet engines and that may have helped them make vehicle and power-generating equipment. The exports may have continued until as recently as last year.    French officials are continuing their investigations into the case, and some sources said they believe that more illicit exports may be uncovered. Western countries recently agreed to step up their efforts to control sensitive exports to Communist countries, which they attempt to do through the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls.    Experts disagreed on whether the exports were more or less damaging than the exports of similar equipment by a unit of Japan's Toshiba Corp. That equipment was used to make quiet propellers to help Soviet nuclear submarines avoid detection.    Either way, the recent French exports apparently were seriously damaging to the West. Sources said the fact that the four men were jailed in the midst of France's presidential campaign reflected the importance attached to the case.    The new scandal also involves Norway's Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk AS, which supplied the computerized controllers for both the French machinery and the Toshiba machinery, as well as for illegal exports by other Western companies. Indeed, a Norwegian police study of Kongsberg's illegal sales seems to have uncovered some of the first evidence that the French company was continuing to sell illegally to the Soviets well into the 1980s.    The arrests involve current and former officials of the French state-owned machine-tool company Machines Francaises Lourdes S.A., or MFL, and its units. The company has gone bankrupt, although two units were sold last year and continue to operate. Its sustained financial trouble -- MFL's two predecessor companies also went bankrupt -- may help explain why executives were allegedly willing to sell to the Soviets. Over a period of years, the Soviets accounted for about 20% of MFL's total sales.    This isn't the first time MFL has been involved in an export scandal. Toshiba has disclosed that a predecessor company of MFL's Forest-Line unit sold the Soviets nine milling machines for use in making submarine propellers in the mid-1970s. Toshiba has asserted that it agreed to sell banned equipment to the Soviets only after learning that the French company had done so. However, the French machines were of relatively low capability, and the sales had been authorized openly by French officials. It was only later, it is alleged, that MFL officials began understating the capabilities of the machines they were selling the Soviets.    The current chairman of a former MFL subsidiary, who wasn't among those accused of wrongdoing, told reporters over the weekend that he doesn't consider the violations to be serious. He suggested that the case has more to do with American pressure on France than with real damage to Western interests. &quot;It may be serious for our relations with the Americans in the context of {export controls}, but for me, it isn't espionage,&quot; the official was quoted by Agence France Presse as saying.    In Washington, Paul Freedenberg, the Commerce Department's undersecretary for export administration, said the U.S. expects France &quot;to vigorously prosecute&quot; the four men. But he said it was &quot;too early to tell&quot; how serious the technology loss was to the West. Similarly, he said he can't yet compare this case with Toshiba, either in terms of technology loss or the vigor of foreign enforcement actions.    He also said it was unclear whether the U.S. would assess sanctions, should the trade bill now pending before the Senate become law. The bill, which President Reagan has threatened to veto, would allow the president to impose sanctions, but only against guilty parties, not successor companies. That would appear to exempt the companies that bought the remnants of MFL, Mr. Freedenberg said.    French investigations indicate that MFL and its predecessor companies sold about 60 machine tools to the Soviets from the early 1970s through the present. It was initially believed here that most of the exports were low-capability machines well within legal limits. But the four executives are accused of lying and falsifying documents, and some sources think that a significant percentage of the 60 sales may have been illegal.    Most prominent of the four jailed men are Louis Tardy, a French industrialist and MFL's chairman until its bankruptcy, and retired Gen. Jean-Paul Chamouton, a former senior Defense Ministry official who had been Forest-Line's chairman.    ---   Bob Davis in Washington contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
