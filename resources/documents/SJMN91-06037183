The council is likely to consider the new law in April.;    The chargesare an attempt to raise money to help pay for new federal requirements forstricter control of illegal discharges into storm sewers, better maintenanceand cleaning of the sewers, and education programs to persuade industries andhomeowners to refrain from dumping contaminants down the storm drains.;    Thecity now charges a onetime fee for storm sewer use when property is developed.Last year that charge raised about $470,000, while the city spent about $1.2million on storm sewer maintenance and repair, said Public Works DirectorRalph Qualls.;    City residents and business owners already pay sanitarysewer service and use charges through their property tax bills. The new stormsewer charge would be added to that amount, which ranges from about $170 for asingle-family home to $120,000 for a 40-acre high-use industrial site.;    Theproposal would add $7,200 annually to that $120,000 industrial bill.;    Twoother California cities have adopted similar charges, although the costs aresubstantially higher than those being considered in San Jose. Homeowners inLos Angeles pay about $28 annually and Palo Alto residents pay about $39 ayear, San Jose officials said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MALINE HAZLE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910206  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  291  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday February 6, 199100037183,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
