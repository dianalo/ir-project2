BPis a much studied powerful PAH carcinogen, common in the environmentand known to undergo glucuronidation both in vitro and in vivo aftermetabolic activation. Two short-term tests for carcinogenicity are usedin this study to asses the anti-carcinogenic potential of DAGDL. Oneof them is in vivo covalent DNA binding which has been widely recognizedas a quantitative indicator of chemical carcinogenesis. Besides DNA binding,the authors also use as a second test for carcinogenicity, the appearanceand concentration in circulation of the carcinogen-treated animal ofa 60 kd oncofetal protein. This present study also tests ability of variouscarcinogenic and non-carcinogenic PAHs to induce the 60 kd oncofetalprotein.</TEXT></DOC>
