All animals were seriallyevaluated to determine lung burdens, held for life-span observation,necropsied at death, and examined histopathologically to characterizethe lesions present and to determine the cause of death. The primarymalignant lung tumors observed in rodents were predominantly squamous-cellcarcinomas and adenocarcinomas, whereas those in dogs at earlier timeswere primarily hemangiosarcomas and those in dogs that died at latertimes were pulmonary carcinomas. The relationship between the incidenceof lung cancer and absorbed beta dose to the lung differed among species.The results of modeling these data provide a better understanding ofhow the choice of species can influence the outcome of a life-span study.The data are used to estimate the risk of lung cancer in man from aninhaled beta-emitting radionuclide. 26 refs., 5 figs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
