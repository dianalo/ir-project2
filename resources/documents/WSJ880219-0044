But it still reflects some of the priorities of his administration.    Spending on space and science programs, for example, would rise more than 20% under the plan. Funds for anti-drug programs in a number of agencies would go up. And programs to fight AIDS and to modernize the nation's air-traffic-control system would get hefty increases.    With education in the public and political spotlight, the president has also reversed his previous efforts to cut education spending, and this year is asking for an increase. And one of his relatively few new proposals would create a limited, educational savings-bond program that would allow some middle-income families to accumulate tax-free savings for education expenses.    The president also abandoned his defense buildup this year. Acknowledging congressional refusal to provide continued increases in defense spending, he is requesting a rise that doesn't even make up for inflation.    The budget for farm spending would be cut, and spending on most other domestic programs would either be cut or kept smaller than needed to keep up with inflation. The administration also proposes the elimination of such perennial Reagan targets as the Economic Development Administration, the Appalachian Regional Commission, Urban Development Action Grants and the Interstate Commerce Commission.    Here are some of the proposals in the president's new budget and how they would affect government programs:   HEALTH   The Reagan administration plans to spend $2 billion to fight AIDS, a 40% increase over the current fiscal year. Of that amount, $900 million would be used for research, $600 million for Medicaid services for poor people with AIDS, $400 million for education and $100 million in income support for those disabled by the disease.    Congressional opposition to a planned $1.2 billion cut in Medicare spending developed even before the budget was officially sent to Capitol Hill. Department of Health and Human Services officials say the cut wouldn't affect beneficiaries because it would be taken from Medicare-financed teaching expenses and not from direct benefits to the 33 million elderly and disabled Medicare recipients. The proposed Medicare budget is $95 billion.    The administration proposes to limit increases in Part B of Medicare, which covers physician and outpatient services, medical equipment and laboratory services, through legislative changes that would save $300 million.    The Medicaid program, which serves 25 million low-income people, would have a $33 billion budget, a slight increase over this year. The proposed HHS budget totals $396.8 billion, a $21.7 billion increase.    EDUCATION   Although the Education Department's $20.3 billion spending plan is nearly 50% higher than its request for the current fiscal year, it is just $1.5 billion more than Congress appropriated for this year.    An additional $2.4 billion for the Guaranteed Student Loan Program reflects a proposed, governmentwide accounting change under which the department would account for the theoretical, estimated cost of lending money below market rates and of guaranteeing privately made loans. Currently, the budget does account for such expenses as defaults and interest paid to lenders by the government while a student borrower is still in school.    Excluding this &quot;credit reform&quot; figure, student aid spending would rise to $8.8 billion from $8.1 billion. The figure includes $2.7 billion for guaranteed loans to 3.7 million students. The number of students receiving some federal assistance would increase slightly, to 9.4 million. The budget also proposes authorizing a new, limited program of tax-free savings bonds for higher education.    Compensatory education programs for disadvantaged children would increase to $4.4 billion from $3.8 billion. Vocational and adult education would be cut to $913 million from $979 million.    WELFARE   Spending on Aid to Families with Dependent Children would total $8.5 billion, a $148 million decrease from the current fiscal year. Child-support enforcement efforts, however, are to receive $900 million, $74 million more than the current year.    Cuts to AFDC, the government's main welfare program, results from such administrative adjustments as correcting erroneous payment rates, and don't reflect any decrease in benefit levels, according to Department of Health and Human Services officials. The number of individuals and families receiving AFDC will remain the same.    Several other programs designed to aid the poor would be eliminated by the president's budget. Federal officials say many of those activities would be included in other programs. Among the programs that would be eliminated are the Work Incentives Program, which has a current budget of $93 million, and activities for the homeless, which currently have a $19 million budget.    HOUSING   The president proposes cutting or restructuring several urban-development and housing-aid programs, and requiring agencies to estimate and fund the cost of loan guarantees. But these proposals, previously rejected by Congress and opposed by interest groups, could fail again.    Despite the proposed cuts, overall spending for the Housing and Urban Development Department would rise to $18.99 billion, a 2.3% increase from the current year. The increase reflects spending commitments made in previous years.    HUD would end Urban Development Action Grants, intended to spur private development in distressed areas, and would drop a program to help build or renovate rental housing for low-income or moderate-income families. A program to help build apartments for the elderly would be targeted more closely for mentally ill people who also are physically handicapped.    Community Development Block Grants, which help pay for municipal improvements and housing rehabilitation, would be trimmed to $2.6 billion from $2.9 billion. And the administration proposes to add about 100,000 new direct-rent subsidies or vouchers -- the cornerstone of its assisted housing policy. That's about twice the amount approved by Congress last year.    EMPLOYMENT   Traditional programs to help dislocated workers would be replaced by an expanded effort, first proposed a year ago, that includes counseling, job-search assistance and skills training. Spending authorization for the plan, which is part of the massive trade bill pending in Congress, would jump to $980 million from $335 million for similar programs this year.    Outlays for all Labor Department employment programs would rise slightly, to $4.96 billion from $4.86 billion.    A revamped youth employment program would let local governments offer year-round training, summer jobs, or both, instead of just jobs, to teen-agers in families receiving federal assistance. Spending on that program would rise $3 million, to $727 million. Job Corps outlays would increase 5% to $675 million, to maintain the existing 40,500 training slots for disadvantaged youth.    Unemployment compensation would rise to $14.8 billion from $14.1 billion, mainly because of cost-of-living increases. The budget projects premium revenue for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. at $785 million, after a jump to $600 million in the current fiscal year from $296 million last year. The increases are the result of recent legislation that mandated higher employer premiums.    TRANSPORTATION   The president seeks a substantial increase in spending for aviation safety programs, while continuing his assault on Amtrak subsidies and mass transit aid. Overall, transportation funding would rise slightly to $26.4 billion from $26.32 billion.    Outlays for the Federal Aviation Administration would rise 9.2% to $5.8 billion, in part reflecting increased funding for the agency's multiyear program to modernize and improve air traffic control facilities. The budget also calls for the hiring of 900 air traffic controllers, which would bring the total to 16,800.    Funds for highways, by far the biggest chunk of the Transportation Department's budget, would rise slightly to $13.46 billion. Rail program spending would be slashed to $26.1 million from $527.4 million, largely by eliminating Amtrak subsidies. Mass transit outlays would decline only slightly, partly reflecting spending commitments made in past years. But the president wants to abolish new discretionary grants to transit programs as well as the Interstate Commerce Commission.    The proposed cuts for Amtrak, mass transit and the ICC are likely to fail in Congress, as they have in the past, but the aviation spending plans will fare better.    SPACE AND SCIENCE   Spending by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would jump 20.5% to $10.98 billion, reflecting hefty increases for the proposed space station and the shuttle program. The budget also seeks funding for two new projects: the Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility, an orbiting telescope, and Pathfinder, which would develop new technologies for space travel.    The proposed spending rise for the space station will likely be the most controversial part of NASA's budget; Congress slashed the administration's request for station funding this fiscal year amid continued questions about the project's purpose and ultimate cost.    The National Science Foundation's budget would rise 8% to $1.82 billion as funding for basic research increases. The administration also wants to create 10 to 15 science and technology centers over the next five years to conduct research and encourage transfer of research findings to the marketplace.    ENERGY   The president stuck with his strategy of putting more money into basic research and building the nation's strategic oil reserve.    The oil reserve would be filled at its current rate of at least 50,000 barrels a day, but the rate would rise to 100,000 barrels if two Naval Petroleum Reserve fields are sold as previously proposed.    The budget proposes $363 million for first-year construction money for the $5.3 billion Superconducting Super Collider, although it's uncertain whether Congress will fund the giant, atom-smashing project. It also proposes $6 million to start work on a new half-billion-dollar, synchrotron light-source facility to study matter.    For the first time, the administration is seeking $60 million to develop a new defense reactor to make tritium for nuclear weapons. Money also is sought for crucial safety repairs at the four current defense reactors, including one being closed in Washington state.    Money for solar, fossil and renewable energy would continue to be sliced, while funds would be increased for research into a nuclear reactor for use in space and in the Star Wars missile-defense system. The administration also renewed its request for $2.5 billion over five years for development of clean coal technology to help alleviate acid rain. Congress already has supplied some funds.    AGRICULTURE   Agriculture Department spending would be trimmed modestly, with cutbacks in housing and rural electrification outlays partly offset by a sharp increase in soil conservation spending.    The department is budgeted to spend $48.3 billion in fiscal 1989, 4.7% less than this year. Crop subsidies to prop up farm income would amount to $17.1 billion, down slightly from $17.7 billion this year. The two-year total of $34.8 billion is $4.9 billion less than was projected last August. The savings reflect rising crop prices and subsidy cuts enacted by Congress.    Food stamp and nutrition outlays would rise 1.2% to $20.7 billion. A $1.1 billion spending increase is seen for the Conservation Reserve Program, under which erodible land is taken out of production.    Outlays by the Farmers Home Administration, Rural Electrification Administration and Federal Crop Insurance Corp. would fall 51% to $3 billion under proposals to kill or slash most direct loan programs in favor of guaranteeing more private loans, issuing rural housing vouchers and selling off Farmers Home and REA assets. The proposals, advanced before, are expected to rile many lawmakers.    ENVIRONMENT   The Environmental Protection Agency's spending would rise about $275 million to $5.13 billion, with more money for Superfund toxic-waste cleanups. Interior Department spending would drop $400 million to $4.99 billion with curbs on construction and land acquisition.    The president again proposes deferring park and refuge land purchases and construction, though Congress overrides him each year. He includes $600,000 to study tearing down the Hetch Hetchy reservoir to reclaim the drenched California valley as park land.    The budget includes money to hold seven sales of offshore oil leases; there have been none outside the Gulf of Mexico since 1984. Sales off certain coasts are opposed by residents, congressmen and some presidential candidates.    As expected, Superfund spending would jump by $425 million to $1.2 billion; 30 sites should be cleaned up by year end. Money for sewage-treatment construction grants continues to be phased out.    The president also seeks private-sector ideas to repair or sell 11,000 Interior Department-owned housing units; sell $530 million in Bureau of Reclamation loans for $130 million; double funds to clean up hazardous waste on federal lands, and try again to cut off state recreation and historic-preservation grants.    LAW ENFORCEMENT   The Justice Department is in line for an overall boost of $643 million, or nearly 13%, with slightly larger percentage increases slated for enforcing immigration laws and building and staffing new jails. But Congress is expected to demand more money for anti-drug programs, especially for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.    The proposed increase, to $5.8 billion from nearly $5.2 billion, reflects additional spending for the Drug Enforcement Administration, and more than 700 additional border patrol agents and prosecutors. FBI increases, in both staff and funding, are largely intended to enhance investigations of white-collar crime, espionage and terrorism. Proposed outlays for drug enforcement are substantially less than congressional critics -- and internal administration documents -- advocate. Lawmakers are again likely to reject elimination of grants to prevent juvenile delinquency and to assist state and local police forces.    FOREIGN AID   Foreign aid spending would decline slightly to $15.6 billion from $15.8 billion, after accounting for some early debt payments.    The administration is trying to stretch a tight budget by converting most aid loans into grants that needn't be repaid. Offering more foreign aid grants, which previously have been given mainly to Israel and Egypt, would allow U.S. diplomats to tell recipients that what they get &quot;is a cut, but (also) a gift,&quot; says a congressional aide. Israel and Egypt continue to receive some two-thirds of U.S. security aid.    The early debt payments would come under a congressional plan allowing foreign governments to refinance, at current interest rates, U.S. loans made at higher rates earlier in the 1980s. The U.S. would guarantee 90% of this private sector refinancing.    Still, says an administration official, budget austerity &quot;leaves us short across the board in every account.&quot;    ---                 Reagan Budget at a Glance                 (In billions of dollars)                                      Fiscal Year                             ----------------------------                             1987    1988    1989    1990    Defense                $282.0   $285.4   $294.0   $306.2    Foreign aid and other     international programs  11.6      9.9     13.3     13.1    Science, space and     technology               9.2     10.9     13.1     15.2    Energy, environment and     natural resources       17.5     17.8     19.1     19.2    Agriculture              27.4     22.4     21.7     19.5    Commerce and housing     credit                   6.2     12.4      7.9      8.6    Transportation           26.2     27.2     27.3     27.4    Health and education     69.7     78.2     85.2     91.5 -    Social Security and     Medicare               282.5    298.6    317.8    342.2    Federal pensions,     unemployment and other     income security        123.2    129.6    135.6    140.6    Veterans' benefits       26.8     27.7     29.6     30.8    Other outlays            20.2     24.1     19.0     19.6    Net interest            138.6    147.9    151.8    156.7    Offsetting receipts     -36.5    -36.1    -41.0    -42.2    TOTAL OUTLAYS        $1,004.6 $1,055.9 $1,094.2 $1,148.3    TOTAL REVENUES         $854.1   $909.2   $964.7 $1,044.1    Deficit                $150.4   $146.7   $129.5   $104.2   NOTE: Figures for 1987 are actual; other years are estimated.
