The results contradict the opinions of many economists.    A panel of 26 senior financial executives said they expect the economy to grow, after inflation, at a rate of 2.5% in 1989 and 2.2% in 1990. Only five of the executives predict a recession over the next two years. The executives, who are surveyed twice a year, said they expect inflation to average 4.4% in 1989 and 4.5% in 1990.    The panel's views &quot;differ sharply from some other recent polls of economists, which suggest a recession during the next two years,&quot; said Vincent G. Massaro, a Conference Board senior economist. One recent poll found that nearly 90% of the business economists surveyed predict a recession in the next two years, he added.    Among other predictions, the panel expects interest rates to average close to current levels in 1989 with a moderate decline in 1990. They forecast the prime lending rate to average 10% next year, edging down to 9.5% in 1990.    They also expect corporate profits to rise at a slower rate next year, and see the Dow Jones Industrial Average staying within a narrow trading range in 1989 and 1990. </TEXT></DOC>
