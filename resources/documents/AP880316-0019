DavidBoren, D-Okla., chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said lateTuesday after the Senate voted 71-19 in favor of the bill.   The measure now goes to the House, where ``overwhelmingapproval'' is likely, according to both Boren and Sen. WilliamCohen, R-Maine, vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee.   The House Intelligence Committee is considering a similar bill,but no date has been set for a vote by the panel or for flooraction.   President Reagan has threatened to veto the legislation as anunconstitutional restriction on his ability to conduct foreignpolicy.   But Boren said, ``That kind of threat has been heard before andit hasn't come true.''   Cohen noted that the 71 votes are four more than the two-thirdswhich would be required to override any presidential veto. ``Andthat 71 total is without some of our supporters here,'' he said.   The bill arises from the Iran-Contra affair, when U.S. weaponswere secretly sold to Iran and some of the profits were diverted tothe Contra guerrillas in Nicaragua.   Reagan withheld notification about the arms sales from Congressfor 10 months.   Current laws require only that the White House give Congess``timely notice'' about covert actions, but they do not define theterm. The Intelligence Committees had been operating on theassumption that the phrase meant only a brief delay in notification.   ``This bill clarifies what we thought was the procedure allalong,'' Cohen said. ``We believed timely meant a couple of daysand we were surprised to find out that the administration wasworking under a different definition.''   The measure doesn't give Congress a veto over covert operations,Cohen noted.   ``There's no piece of legislation that can weave a web ofsecurity around good or bad judgment,'' said Cohen. ``I can't sayfor sure this would have prevented Iran-Contra, but it would meanthat we can give the president the benefit of our advice. Thefunction we serve is to have a second opinion outside theadministration.''   Boren said if the bill eventually becomes law, ``it will help''prevent future problems because ``it clears up so many ambiguitiesthat are in the existing law. It makes the notification process somuch more clear.''   But he warned that ``you can never prevent absolutely any futureIran-Contras, anymore than a law against bank robberies willprevent bank robberies.''   In the wake of the Iran-Contra affair, Cohen noted, Reagan haspromised to tell Capitol Hill about all future covert actions andhas moved administratively to make many of the changes proposed inthe law. ``This only writes into law what the president has alreadysaid he would do,'' Cohen said.   The bill also requires written ``findings,'' which are thepresidential orders authorizing covert operations. Some actions inthe Iran-Contra affair were done under an oral finding which wasopen to misinterpretation, Boren said.   Before passing the bill, the Senate rejected, 60-32, a proposalby Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., to allow notification within 10 days,instead of two days.   Chafee said the time period was long enough to permit actions,such as the rescue of hostages, in which lives might be endangeredby leaks of information, but short enough to discover situationssuch as the Iranian arms sale.   Earlier, the chamber voted 73-18 to limit debate. That was 13more votes than needed to invoke cloture and block an attempt byconservative Republicans to pass the measure.   One opponent, Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., said: ``This bill isbadly drafted, badly conceived, and the worst of its conceptions isthat somehow you can legislate intelligence ... it's hard for me tobelieve that one piece of legislation can obviate stupid activity.''   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci testified last week thatReagan believed the bill was an unconstitutional restriction onpresidential authority and would veto it. Carlucci took over asReagan's national security adviser in the wake of the Iran-Contraaffair.</TEXT></DOC>
