By using somatic cell hybrids andin situ chromosomal hybridization, the authors localized this gene tohuman chromosome 5 at bands q23-31, a chromosomal region that is frequentlydeleted [del(5q)] in patients with myeloid disorders. By in situ hybridization,IL-3 was found to be deleted in the 5q-chromosome of one patient withrefractory anemia who had a del(5)(q15q33.3), of three patients withrefractory anemia (two patients) or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL)de novo who had a similar distal breakpoint [del(5)(q13q33.3)], and ofa fifth patient, with therapy-related ANLL, who had a similar distalbreakpoint in band q33[del(5)(q14q33.3)]. Southern blot analysis of somaticcell hybrids retaining the normal or the deleted chromosome 5 from twopatients with the refractory anemia 5q- syndrome indicated that IL-3sequences were absent from the hybrids retaining the deleted chromosome5 but not from hybrids that had a cytologically normal chromosome 5.Thus, a small segment of chromosome 5 contains IL-3, GM-CSF, CSF-1, andFMS. The findings and earlier results indicating that GM-CSF, CSF-1,and FMS were deleted in the 5q- chromosome, suggest that loss of IL-3or of other CSF genes may play an important role in the pathogenesisof hematologic disorders associated with a del(5q).</TEXT></DOC>
