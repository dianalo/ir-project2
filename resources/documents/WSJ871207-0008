The announcement, which followed months of bargaining between Iberia and prospective suppliers, marked a defeat for Seattle-based Boeing Co., which until recently had been considered a favorite to win part of the contract.    Industry sources said a last-minute offer from St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp. had clinched part of the contract in its favor.    As expected, the other part was granted to Airbus Industrie, the European consortium in which the Spanish state-owned company Construcciones Aeronauticas SA is a partner.    Details of Iberia's fleet renewal plans to replace an aging fleet of A-300s, Boeing 727s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9s -- an operation dubbed by the Spanish press as the &quot;contract of the century&quot; -- initially had been expected to be announced last summer.    But as each company forwarded increasingly attractive rival bids, Iberia put off its final decision for weeks and then months.    Terms of the contract weren't disclosed, but Iberia said the 17 MD-87s and the 15 A-320s would cost a total of 120 billion pesetas, and the eight A-340s would cost 79 billion pesetas.    Separately, McDonnell Douglas confirmed that Scandinavian Airlines Systems won't go through with a tentative order for 12 MD-11 jumbo jets.    A year ago, the estimated $1.2 billion tentative order helped the aerospace and aircraft concern decide to proceed with plans to build the new commercial aircraft, a successor to the DC-10.    A spokesman for Douglas Aircraft Co., the McDonnell Douglas division that is building the plane, said the SAS move leaves the company with orders, conditional orders and options from 14 customers for 93 MD-11s. When the decision to build the plane was made last December, the company had 92 such commitments.    &quot;Of course, any time you don't have 12 airplanes sold that you thought you had sold, it has an impact,&quot; the spokesman said. But he said the program is &quot;going along very quickly.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
