Carabello is dean of the Defense Department's IRM College, which tookthe place of the old DOD Computer Institute (DODCI) last March.andM;The IRM College will develop and teach IRM courses for the National DefenseUniversity, and will carry out think-tank and applied research studiesrelated to IRM policy.andM;On Sept. 10, the college will admit its first students in the AdvancedManagement Program, a four-month graduate-level course on the financial,technical, operational and managerial aspects of IRM.andP;  The course is for DODSenior Executive Service (SES) members, GS/GM grades 14-15, general/flagofficers and military grades 05-06.andM;The Advanced Management Program also is open to other senior federal andstate employees who manage information system programs.andP;  A second class willbe admitted in February 1991.andM;A charter SES member, Carabello joined the National Defense University in1988 after serving as program manager for the Foreign Military Sales andFinance Management Improvement Program.andM;Prior to that, he was principal assistant to the deputy secretary of Defensefor management systems and was responsible for the work of the DefenseCouncil on Integrity Management Improvement.andM;Carabello entered federal service in 1965.andP;  He holds a bachelor's degree fromAlbright College and a master's degree in public administration of managementsystems from the University of Southern California.andM;GCN staff writer Kevin Power interviewed Carabello and Doreen Schatzberg, theIRM College's associate dean for program development, at their WashingtonNavy Yard office.andM;GCN: What is the role of the IRM College?andM;CARABELLO: The college is an evolving refinement and expansion of theDepartment of Defense Computer Institute (DODCI), which began in 1964.andP;  As oflast March 1, it became the IRM College.andM;Our mission is to provide education, training and echnical assistance to IRMprogram managers and their staffs and others responsible for DOD's IRMpolicies and programs.andM;We are preparing a new advanced management program, a four-monthinterdisciplinary education and research opportunity for senior managers.andM;GCN: What prompted the change to an IRM focus?andM;CARABELLO: What drove us was the fact that information resources began toemerge as a critical resource with a lot of potential, but also with ahistory of difficulties.andM;We had large office automation systems that came in late and over budget anddid not achieve their goals.andP;  It was clear that the single biggestcontributing factor was lack of education and training for the people incharge.andM;There's plenty of technical training available, but our problems were reallymanagerial.andP;  The Defense University had the mandate for it, and DODCI hadbeen given that task in the fall of 1988.andP;  Since then, we've been evolvingnew courses and faculty.andP;  The capstone of the curriculum improvement is theadvanced management program.andM;SCHATZBERG:  We had nothing like it so we had to build from the ground up.andO;We followed the standard development techniques for systems analysistraining, beginning with requirements analysis.andM;We started with a sample of IRM program managers and personnel and had someinput from the General Services Administration, the General Accounting Officeand others outside DOD.andM;We came up with a basic course design, a layout of lessons and instructionalmethods, and now we're completing an interdisciplinary review.andP;  The next stepis implementation followed by an evaluation by the students.andM;GCN: What do you need to make the college work as planned?andM;CARABELLO: If you don't get first-class faculty you don't get anything.andP;  Youhave to attract capable people, and I think our faculty has the right mix ofacademic, industry and government experience.andM;We were not looking for a lot of techies or bits and bytes people.andP;  We alsodidn't want to emphasize the traditional topic of acquisition, because therealready are a number of good schools that do that.andM;We wanted professors with a broad base of experience, who could take factsand extrapolate them into concept and theory.andP;  We want to be able to lookoutside and help DOD come to grips with primary questions, such as the roleof IRM in force generation.andM;It's been said that if you have compters you can eliminate other things, butI'm not so sure that's true.andP;  Information is supposed to be the glue thatholds together the traditional man, money and material resources, but howdoes it do that?andM;For too long IRM has been compartmentalized with departments.andP;  It's high timewe looked at how they all relate, because those are the issues that theOffice of the Secretary of Defense is getting at in the corporate informationmanagement [CIM] initiative and the various consolidation studies going on.andM;GCN: What are the keys to success for you?andM;CARABELLO: We have to make sure our faculty stays in touch with reality.andP;  Thedanger for any academic institution is that it becomes irrelevant.andP;  It's easyto answer the kinds of questions we wish people would ask, rather than theones they're really asking.andM;We have to make sure we put out correct information by keeping out faculty inclose touch with real world problems.andP;  Our motto is to educate and sendforth, and that's significant because we're talking about providing a highlevel of education, training and technical assistance to practitioners.andM;The measure of our effectiveness is whether the people who leave here aremore effective and the programs and systems they manage turn out to be moreuseful and do not repeat the mistakes of the past.andM;GCN: What do your students and DOD officials expect from the college?andM;CARABELLO: We're still finding that out.andP;  We have a curriculum and advisorycouncil made up of senior IRM executives in DOD and the services.andP;  It'sclaired by Cynthia Kendall [DOD's deputy comptroller for IRM] and meetsquarterly.andM;The constant emphasis has been on management, and I think that's reflected inthe name of our institution.andP;  The term computer is not mentioned in any ofour course listins because if you need to learn the technology, there areother good places to go.andP;  We focus on the management of technology.andP;  We're amacro-level school.andM;GCN: How has the overhaul of DOD's management philosophy affected you?andM;CARABELLO: This really is a bellwether period for information technology.andO;There are periods of stability punctuated by periods of absolutelyfundamental change.andP;  We're in one of those change stages now as DOD rethinksits whole stance with respect to IRM.andM;I want the college to mirror that, support that, assist in that so we reallyare in the forefront.andP;  The college is providing facilitators on the CIMinitiative and staff support for the consolidation studies.andM;That translates back into the classroom.andP;  We've got people who can look theirstudents in the eye and say, &quot;I'm not hypothesizing.&quot;andM;GCN: There's been talk about using the college for a new Trail Boss Trainingcourse in system implementation.andP;  How much help or training can you giveother agencies?andM;CARABELLO: We're aware of that [Trail Boss study] and have been talkingextensively.andM;Even though the college is structured to address DOD problems, other agenciescan benefit.andP;  It's important to keep broadening our perspective.andM;However, the limited its that this building is not configured to teachadvanced management courses, so we had to limit our first class to 15students.andM;In 1992 the college is supposed to relocate to the National DefenseUniversity at Fort MoNair, ad that's when we can expand class size andconsider more non-an expand DOD people.andM;GCN: What's the next development step?andM;CARABELLO: Regardless of how effective the first class is, we will go througha significant evaluation period of two to three years to give the studentsand the department the kind of program they deserve.andM;We have to determine how our courses can be accredited.andP;  We're also going tomake significant use of the think tank and technical assistance functions.andO;I'd like to see the school do applied research and solve some real problems.andM;GCN: What issues will you be examining?andM;CARABELLO: Clearly there is a tendency to move farther and farther into thefront end of the IRM life cycle.andM;When this was DODCI, everyone was thinking about the acquisition phase.andP;  Nowpeople are saying that's a dependent variable based on the front-end work.andO;Now it's how you figure out the business objectives and strategies of theorganization.andP;  We need to look at what kinds of information and systems areneeded to support that.andM;GCN: What more do you need to do before the first advanced course begins?andM;CARABELLO: You always wish you had more time.andP;  We would like to find a betterway to disseminate information about the college and the courses morequickly.andM;GCN: What is the makeup of the first advanced management class?andM;CARABELLO: It's a four-month interdisciplinary education and researchopportunity, and the level of expectation is high, as it should be.andM;The average grade is a GM-15.andP;  We have some Senior Executive Service people.andO;This is a first-time offering, and it's really a litmus test.andM;GCN: Looking back, is there anything you would change in the way youdeveloped the advanced program?andM;CARABELLO: There are always moments when you're pushing the schedule todeath.andP;  But I don't know that I would do anything differently.andM;In a process like this, there's a lot you learn as you go along.andP;  Doingsomething differently would probably just mean changing one set of mistakesor experiences for another.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
