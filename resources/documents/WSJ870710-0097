But today, equality is one of the fastest-expanding principles in the Constitution, and its scope and meaning are hotly debated in this bicentennial year.    Some Reagan administration officials and other conservatives say federal judges and the Supreme Court have strayed well beyond the purpose of the 14th Amendment guarantee, ratified in 1868, that no &quot;person&quot; may be denied the &quot;equal protection of the laws.&quot; They criticize affirmative action as a form of race bias and push for a narrow approach to equality generally.    Assistant Attorney General William Reynolds has criticized Supreme Court Justice William Brennan's approach to equality as &quot;radical egalitarianism&quot; that is beyond the intent of the framers of the Constitution or the Congress that wrote the 14th Amendment.    But some historians say there is evidence to support a broad reading that the 14th Amendment protects against a wide range of discrimination. Judith Baer, a political scientist and author of the book &quot;Equality Under the Constitution,&quot; says &quot;The Supreme Court really hasn't gone far enough in guaranteeing equality.&quot; The broad language of the amendment and its legislative history suggest that it goes &quot;far beyond just racial discrimination,&quot; says Prof. Baer, who teaches at California Polytechnic Institute.    Moreover, critics of the administration say that, rather than advocating a method of interpreting the Constitution, it is merely pushing its own political agenda. &quot;The Reagan administration is engaged in an aggressive, systematic campaign . . . to turn back the clock and bring to an end effective civil rights enforcement,&quot; writes Laughlin McDonald, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer in Atlanta.    For the past 33 years, the story of equality under the Constitution, and under federal civil rights laws, has been primarily a tale of eradicating discrimination based on race, with substantial side excursions in the last decade into sex bias as well.    But the concept of equality in the future is certain to present the Supreme Court with new challenges. The high court has declined to extend the constitutional right of privacy to homosexuals. But it may be only a matter of time before the justices are asked to consider a case of discrimination against a homosexual victim, perhaps a state or local government worker dismissed out of fear over acquired immune deficiency syndrome. &quot;Hostility toward gays has gotten to look much more like hostility toward blacks,&quot; says Eric Schnapper, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.    William Taylor, a longtime Washington civil rights lawyer, says poverty and access to government resources compose another issue of equality that will arise. &quot;The wealth disparities in society and the isolation of the poor are growing so enormous,&quot; he says, &quot;that if there is an overriding equality issue for the next 25 years, that is it.&quot;    The Supreme Court's approach to sex discrimination, that it needs attention but is less onerous than racial bias, means the justices will have to stay active in women's rights cases, says Marcia Greenberger, a lawyer with the civil rights-oriented Center for Law and Social Policy.    But civil rights lawyers also fear that the future, especially with changes in the membership of the Supreme Court, may cover old ground, as well. &quot;For minorities, the question is going to be as we get to newer, unforeseen situations, will there be regression?&quot; asks Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Georgetown University Law School professor and former head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.    For much of the nation's history, regression wouldn't have been possible. When the Constitutional Convention met in the summer of 1787, the question of equality was raised only in a discussion of slavery some three months into the session. The word &quot;equal,&quot; in the context of rights, doesn't appear in the Constitution.    The delegates, in political compromises, voted to count slaves at three-fifths their actual numbers in dividing up House seats, to permit slaves to be imported until 1808 and to require extradition of runaway slaves. On Aug. 21, 1787, Luther Martin of Maryland told the delegates that slavery is &quot;dishonorable to the American character.&quot; But John Rutledge of South Carolina defined the political necessity of the moment, saying, &quot;The true question . . . is whether the Southern states shall or shall not be parties to the Union.&quot;    Some historians argue that the Constitution implicitly adopted the principles of the Declaration of Independence, which said that &quot;all men are created equal.&quot; But Prof. Baer of California Polytechnic argues that it was the 14th Amendment that put that principle into the Constitution.    The amendment grew out of the antislavery movement in the mid-1800s. The words &quot;equal protection&quot; were drafted after a joint House-Senate panel rejected drafts that referred to &quot;full protection&quot; or to &quot;race and color.&quot; The amendment was little-used -- and then largely to restrict civil rights -- until the Supreme Court's 1954 school-desegregation decision. Since then, says Georgetown's Prof. Norton, there has been &quot;a constitutional revolution.&quot;    The high court has created different levels of scrutiny for laws that infringe on individual or group rights. Infringement based on race or against immigrants is hardest to justify, sex bias is in a middle category, and other forms of bias require only a rational basis. The standards are criticized by some legal scholars. &quot;This is a far cry from the clarity of the framers of the 14th Amendment,&quot; says Dennis Hutchinson, a University of Chicago law professor. But civil rights lawyers cling to the structure for the protection it has provided.    Equality occupies a prominent place in bicentennial debate -- at least in part because of Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall's perspective on history. It took, he said last May, &quot;several amendments, a civil war, and momentous social transformation to attain the system of constitutional government, and its respect for the individual freedoms and human rights, we hold as fundamental today.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
