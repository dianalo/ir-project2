After a long day of speeches defending the flag, theConstitution or both, the lawmakers voted 254-177 in favor ofthe amendment, but that was more than 30 votes short of thetwo-thirds majority required.</LP><TEXT>   Proponents of the amendment were confident last week thatthey would muster the votes for passage. This week, however,the amendment lost momentum when the House JudiciaryCommittee sent it to the floor without a recommendation. Thenon Wednesday, the Rules Committee voted to bring the measureto the floor yesterday, denying proponents time they saidthey needed to round up additional votes.   Also helping opponents of the amendment was theintroduction of a bill that would outlaw flag desecrationlikely to cause violence. The proposed statute was narrowlydrafted to try to fall within exceptions to the FirstAmendment that the Supreme Court has already carved out.While it was ultimately defeated, 236-178, after theamendment failed, it gave opponents of the amendment a chanceto cast a vote for the flag.   Charges of political maneuvering were leveled by bothsides. &quot;What is at stake,&quot; said Rep. John Bryant (D., Texas),an opponent of the amendment, &quot;is the self-respect of everymember of the House.&quot; Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) said&quot;history will regard this as a paroxysm of fear&quot; should theamendment pass.   House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R., Ill.), a sponsorof the amendment, said that the measure should be voted &quot;upor down&quot; without considering the proposed statute.   Opponents pointed out that the amendment would be thefirst substantive change in the Bill of Rights since itsincorporation into the Constitution 200 years ago. But RepLynn Martin (R., Ill.) countered: &quot;You would think we wereburning the Bill of Rights. Nothing could be further from thetruth.&quot;   But the strength of the anti-amendment vote indicates thatthe opposition strategy -- to paint the issue as the flag vs.the Bill of Rights -- was successful.   The negative votes reached 145, the number necessary todefeat the measure, 10 minutes into the 15 minutes allottedfor the vote. When a vote passes or fails well before thetime allotted, undecided members are given a politicalwindfall, allowing them to take the safer political route.   Addressing the House late in the day, Speaker Thomas Foley(D., Wash.) encouraged opponents of the bill to resistpolitical pressure to pass the amendment. He pictured thevote as a non-partisan issue and appealed directly toRepublicans for support. &quot;If it is not conservative toprotect the Bill of Rights,&quot; he said, &quot;I do not know whatconservatism is today.&quot;   Mr. Foley's appearance in the well of the Houseunderscored his direct involvement in the fight. From theoutset, President Bush's demands for a constitutionalamendment have provoked an almost visceral opposition fromthe speaker. The son of a judge, Mr. Foley is steeped intradition and by nature cautious. While these qualitiescontribute to a sometimes frustrating, often passive style,they served him well in the fight against the amendment.   Rank-and-file Democrats watched with a certain joy to seeMr. Foley assert himself openly. Behind the scenes, thespeaker called members personally and was an early advocateof a strategy to take on the issue squarely on the floor. &quot;Itis a clear victory for the speaker,&quot; said Rep. Matthew McHugh(D., N.Y.). &quot;It validates not only his substantive positionbut his strategy in bringing it up early.&quot;   Rep. Foley received a standing ovation from bothRepublicans and Democrats after his address.   The debate, centering on questions about basic Americanvalues, allowed members to quote liberally from sources suchas the Constitution, the Pledge of Allegiance, ThomasJefferson, James Madison and Voltaire. But contemporaryfigures weren't left out, as John Lennon, Andrew Dice Clayand Norman Rockwell were also among those cited.   The proposed statute, introduced by Reps. Jim Cooper (D.,Tenn.) and Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), called for fines of as muchas $100,000 for desecrating the flag in a manner that waslikely to incite violence and fines of as much as $250,000for the destruction of publicly owned flags on federalproperty. The bill was designed to agree with previousSupreme Court decisions on free speech. In 1969, the highcourt suggested that speech may not be protected if it isintended to incite imminent violence.   While failure in the House kills the amendment, the Senateis likely to go ahead with a vote if only to give members achance to go on record on the issue. A constitutionalamendment requires a two-thirds vote of both houses ofcongress, plus the approval of the legislatures ofthree-fourths of the states.   ---   David Rogers contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
