Marcos made the pledge in an interview with ABC News in which heagain expressed a wish to return to the Philippines for the funeralof his mother, Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died May 4 at the age of95.   Mrs. Aquino has rejected earlier pleas to allow his return,saying he is a threat to national security.   ``My mother is dead and I'd like to go home,'' Marcos said inslow, somewhat slurred speech from his home in Honolulu.   ``I will support the Aquino government to prevent anyadventurism or prevent any attempt at the takeover by thecommunists,'' he said.   ``There is nothing that Madame Aquino should fear from me,'' hesaid. ``I mean well. And if I should be any obstacle, we will beable to work it out.''   Marcos fled to Hawaii after a civilian-military uprising toppledhis 20-year administration and brought Mrs. Aquino to power inFebruary 1986.   Marcos supporters have been linked to several coup attemptsagainst the Aquino government.   The Reagan administration barred Marcos from leaving Hawaiiwithout permission after the Aquino government claimed he hadchartered a plane in January 1987 to return home if a coup attemptsucceeded.   About 8,000 people marched in Manila on Sunday in support ofallowing Marcos' return for the funeral, and more than 1,000gathered Sunday in Honolulu for a memorial service.</TEXT></DOC>
