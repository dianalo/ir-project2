Sampleswere taken on a bi-weekly basis and physiological, biochemical, and histologicaltechniques were used to evaluate the effects of chemical contaminantson growth, energetics, and reproduction of caged mussels. Biologicalmeasurements were correlated with chemical data on body burdens of PCBsand PAHs, including an analysis of seasonal variability in contaminantdistributions related to reproductive and metabolic activities. Theseanalyses provide an in situ evaluation of exposure and bioavailabilityas well as an integration of a suite of organismal and sub-organismalmeasures for estimating survival and reproductive potential in responseto contaminant perturbations.</TEXT></DOC>
