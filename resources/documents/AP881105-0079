Urban commandos last week hit the national guard headquarterswith mortar and rifle fire, killing four soldiers and wounding 38people. It was the largest attack in the city in seven years.   ``This is only the beginning,'' the rebels boasted in a broadcaston their clandestine Radio Venceremos. ``Prepare yourselvesSalvadorans, the hour is near.''   The barracks attack capped more than a month of increasedactivity by the Farbabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a groupof five leftist armies battling the U.S.-backed and -suppliedgovernment since 1979.   The rebels say they are showing their strength. The U.S. embassysays the guerrillas are losing in the country and the city attacksare an act of desperation and a search for publicity.   The ultra-convervative National Republican Alliance, known asArena, blames the raids on a ``power vacuum'' in President JoseNapoleon Duarte's Christian Democratic government.   Duarte is ill with terminal cancer and, for the first time inyears, the March elections will include leftist candidates.   U.S. Ambassador William Walker linked renewed rebel activity tothe presidential elections and a Nov. 14 meeting of the Organizationof American States in San Salvador.   ``With the world's, or at least the hemispheric spotlight onthem, they are using dramatic gestures to say `we're here,''' theambassador said.   The guerrillas promised to take the war to the cities early lastyear, but until recently their attacks were infrequent and small.   However, since Sept. 13 the guerrillas have maintained pressurein rural areas and moved into new regions of thisMassachussetts-sized nation of 5 million.   ``As of today I know what the war is. Before it had been only onthe television,'' said Isabel Burgos, a resident of Zaragoza, afteran Oct. 6 attack on the town 12 miles south of San Salvador.   That same day commandos using grenade launchers staged arapid-fire morning attack on the Legislative Assembly in SanSalvador.   On Oct. 18, two car bombs exploded in parking lots in the poshEscalon neighborhood.   ``There are no more areas of tranquility for the guardians ofexploitation. It is not fair that the bombs and explosions are heardonly in the rural zones, in the homes of the poor,'' the rebels saidin a broadcast.   The military has increased patrols in the sprawling capital, butthe 1 million or so inhabitants seem unaffected by the war.   Working-class neighborhoods still teem with activity. Crowds cramthe outdoor cafes in the chic Zona Rosa, scene of a 1985 hit-and-runshooting that killed six Americans, including four U.S. Marines.   However, the guerrillas' occasional calls for transportationstoppages are largely respected.   The U.S. Embassy, which overseas $1.5 million in aid per day tothe Salvadoran government, says the guerrillas are frustratedbecause they haven't been able to topple the elected Duarteadministration.   ``There's no doubt of increased actions (in the capital) in thelast couple of months,'' Walker said in an interview last week.``But blowing up a hamburger joint is not a great demonstration ofmilitary strength.''   Asked about Wednesday's national guard attack, he said: ``Theycan do that on occasion and will be able to do that for some time.But it doesn't particularly demonstrate military prowess.''   More than 65,000 Salvadorans, many of them civilians, have beenkilled in the war. The last attack as large as the national guardattack came in January 1981, when the guerrillas launched a failed``final offensive.''   Groups traditionally sympathetic to the guerrillas, including theRoman Catholic Church, criticized the recent actions, especially thecar bombs.   Carlos Diaz Barrera, a member of the newly formed DemocraticConvergence, a coalition of three leftist parties, also saidcivilians should be respected but added that the barracks attack wasa legitimate act of war.   ``These are the effects and not the causes of the war. The causesare internal, produced by extreme poverty, the oligarchy and U.S.intervention,'' Diaz Barrera said.</TEXT></DOC>
