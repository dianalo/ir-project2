The Food and Drug Administration said the drug, clozapine, canbe used only for patients who have not responded to at least tworegimens of standard, less toxic therapy.   An estimated 200,000 people could benefit from the drug, the FDAsaid.   The drug has been shown to relieve the symptoms of severeschizophrenia, allowing patients to lead more productive lives.   But the drug also can cause a potentially fatal blood disordercalled agranulocytosis, in which the level of infection-fightingwhite blood cells is reduced. Studies have shown the condition canbe reversed if caught early.   Under the monitoring system, a home health care company willdistribute the prescribed medication to patients each week andcollect blood samples that will be sent to a national laboratoryfor analysis, the FDA said.   If the test results indicate the patient must stop taking thedrug, the patient's doctor will be notified immediately bytelephone.   The testing program was proposed by Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corp.of East Hanover, N.J., which will market the drug under the tradename Clozaril.   It is believed to be the first time the FDA has approved such atesting plan along with a new drug, an agency spokeswoman said.   Agranulocytosis occurs in 1 percent to 2 percent of patientstaking clozapine, said Sandoz spokesman David Winter.   In each of the 15 cases of the blood disorder that occurredduring testing, the side effect was caught early enough for thecondition to be reversed. The FDA said, however, that ``even withthe careful monitoring system planned, some fraction of patientswho develop agranulocytosis may die.''   The drug is also associated with seizures.   FDA Commissioner Frank Young acknowledged the serious risksassociated with use of the drug, but said, ``The severity andhopelessness of unremitting chronic schizophrenia was an importantfactor in the decision to approve clozapine.''   Schizophrenia can be incapacitating without effective treatment,often leaving the patient incoherent, plagued by continual fear andthreatening hallucinations, and unable to care for themselves.   Clozapine was first evaluated in the early 1960s by Sandoz Ltd.of Basel, Switzerland, and marketed in several foreign countries.But its development as an antipsychotic drug in the United Stateswas abandoned and the drug was taken off the market in othercountries in the mid-1970s when it was linked to agranulocytosiswith several deaths in Finland.</TEXT></DOC>
