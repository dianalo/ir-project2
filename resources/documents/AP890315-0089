LaBELLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TABA, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Egyptians today raised their flag over thislong-disputed Red Sea resort as an Israeli convoy pulled out, endinga territorial dispute that bedeviled the neighbors' relations forseven years.   Egyptian troops carrying rifles entered the 250-acre strip ofbeach in groups of three. Hundreds of Egyptian workers climbed ahill overlooking the resort, sang their national anthem and chanted``Allahu Akbar,'' God is Great.   At the same time, a convoy of dozens of Israeli buses, policevehicles and cars left Taba along with about 50 protesting hotelworkers who sang Israel's national anthem. Two Israeli patrol boatsstood off the beach.   A contingent of green-bereted Israeli border police stopped toshake hands with Egyptian police before departing.   A large Israeli flag was defiantly waved from the top floorwindow of the 10-story Sonesta Hotel, apparently by an Israeli hotelguest, as the Egyptians raised their black, white and red flag.   The Israelis had lowered their flag during the night.   Today's pullout was preceded by last-minute demonstrations bysome of the Sonesta's 350 Israeli workers, who fear losing theirjobs and demand that Israel guarantee the jobs or providecompensation.   During the flag-raising, hotel workers burned tires on a hilloverlooking the hotel, sending up a large column of black smoke.   ``We want our rights. The government is prepared to give back theland, but they can't give us up,'' an Israeli woman shouted atpolice, who had arrested several workers earlier.   Israel radio broadcast live from the scene. ``From this moment,Taba is Egyptian,'' the announcer said dramatically.   Yitzhak Lior, deputy director general of the Israeli foreignministry and the senior Israeli present, said ``We went to court,and this was the decision. At the bottom line, we arrived at amutual compromise without scars.''   Ahmed Al Masiri, Egypt's counsel-general in the adjacent Israeliresort of Eilat, was quoted by Israel radio as saying the path toimproved relations between the former adversaries was ``now open.''   ``I hope this will be a bridge to peace, peace between the twopeoples,'' he was quoted as saying.   However, Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Prime Minister YitzhakShamir of Israel, said: ``We are not celebrating. We are sad that wehave been forced to give up Taba, never mind the reason. But weaccept the decision, and we are carrying it out.''   The turnover came seven years after Israel ended a staged pulloutfrom the Sinai Peninsula, which it captured in the 1967 Middle Eastwar and returned as part of a U.S.-mediated peace treaty signedMarch 26, 1979.   Taba's return also comes at a time of increased pressure onIsrael to yield the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchangefor peace under pressure of the 15-month Palestinian uprising.   Butros Ghali, Egypt's minister of state for foreign affairs, saidresolving the conflict over Taba peacefully ``is a victory for therule of international law'' and the provisions of the 1979 treaty.   The Taba agreement worked out with international arbitration andU.S. mediation calls for the hotel to be sold to Egypt for $37million and the adjacent holiday village of thatched beach huts wassold for $1.5 million.   There appeared to be no refusal by Israelis to leave Taba asthere was in Sinai when authorities had to forcibly remove Israelisettlers from the town of Yamit.   On the beach, green bereted Israeli border police emptied theirguard hut at the former barbed wire frontier and left.   Nearby, Dudu Oren, 31, a lifeguard at Taba beach for eight years,cleared out his shack and piled his belongings on the beach.   Oren said he had been married on the beach in Taba and gave his2-year-old son the Hebrew name of Yam for the sea that laps itsshores.   He said his whole life was tied up in Taba but that he hoped hisleaving ``will be good for peace.''</TEXT></DOC>
