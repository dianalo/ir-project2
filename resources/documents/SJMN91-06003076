Gorbachev's newly strengthened Federation Council todayendorsed a plan to keep the 15 restive republics under a unified economicsystem, Soviet media reported.;    The agreement, part of a larger UnionTreaty intended to hold the fragmenting country together, still must beapproved by the individual republics' parliaments before becoming law.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GORBACHEV'S UNITY PLAN IS ENDORSED BY COUNCIL  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Nevertheless, the preliminary approval of Gorbachev's plan was the firstconcrete step toward preserving the union since he persuaded the Sovietparliament last week to broaden his presidential powers or face worseningeconomic and political crises.;    &quot;This is a reaction to the criticalsituation that has grown in society,&quot; Gorbachev said in an interview withSoviet television and the state news agency Tass. &quot;A tug-of-war is still goingon between the center and the republics, and months have been lost.&quot;;    TheFederation Council was formed in a government reorganization nine months agoas a high-level presidential advisory group, but at the time its duties werenot defined.;    Last month, the Congress of People's Deputies approved apackage of constitutional amendments that gave the council more power toreview Kremlin policy and resolve ethnic disputes. The council's membershipwas also broadened to include leaders of about 20 autonomous republics andother smaller regions.;    The council now has 37 standing members, but itssize can fluctuate depending on the number of other groups attending itssessions. Gorbachev, as the nation's president, is its chairman.;    Mostclauses of the economic agreement were worked out in December. But the federalbudget and republics' contributions to it emerged as a new sticking point lastweek when lawmakers from the vast Russian republic voted to cut theircontribution by 85 percent.;    Six republics -- Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia,Armenia, the Ukraine and Georgia -- already have said they will not sign theUnion Treaty. They say the Kremlin must recognize their sovereignty first andlet them join voluntarily.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Moscow  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910103  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  16A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  315  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday January 3, 199100003076,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
