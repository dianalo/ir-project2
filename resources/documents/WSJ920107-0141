Sprint, the third-largest long-distance telephone companyin the U.S. and a subsidiary of Westwood, Kan.-based UnitedTelecommunications Inc., will spend about 200 million pounds($376 million) over 10 years to build the network if it getsa green light, said Paolo Guidi, president of SprintInternational.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is the first attempt by a company that is not partof the existing duopoly (British Telecommunications PLC andMercury Communications) to develop such a network in theU.K.,&quot; said Mr. Guidi. However, he said, rather thanchallenge British Telecom and Mercury, a unit of Cable andamp;Wireless PLC, &quot;across the board, we want to build a state ofthe art network for large corporate users. Even BritishTelecom and Mercury could take advantage of it for underlyingtransmission capacity to provide some services.&quot;   Sprint, which currently provides data communicationsservices, electronic messaging and specialty facsimiletransmission in the U.K., will expand its offerings via thenew network, Mr. Guidi said. &quot;We want to provide basicpoint-to-point private line services to corporations andnetwork management services as well.&quot;   The impetus for such efforts, he said, was a March 1991White Paper in which the British government called on outsidetelecommunications service providers to enter the market. Atabout that time Sprint began negotiating rights of way withBritish Waterways, the national operator of the U.K.'sextensive canal system.   Now &quot;Waterways will be a partner in the project,&quot; said Mr.Guidi. &quot;And we'll invite other participants to invest in it.&quot;He declined to disclose the size of Waterways' share of theinvestment or identify other potential partners that are innegotiations with Sprint.</TEXT></DOC>
