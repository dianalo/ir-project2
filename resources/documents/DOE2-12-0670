However, the difficulties associated with accurate measurementsof crack under dynamic loading are considerable. Thus there are no standardizedprocedures and few reliable results. A systematic study of the dynamicfracture toughness of SAE-01 tool steel, 4340 and HY100 steels, and atungsten are described using the Interferometric Strain/DisplacementGage (ISDG) system which has very high frequency resolution. The ISDGsystem is used to measure the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) 100microns behind a fatigue crack tip in a three-point bend specimen. Staticmeasurements on similar specimens serve to calibrate the method and ensureconsistency with the accepted procedures for static fracture toughnesstesting. Finite element analyses are used to obtain full field informationat the point of initiation and to assess the material characteristicswhich lead to changes in toughness with loading rate. The major advantageof the method is that information is obtained very close to the cracktip, so that stress wave loading effects are accounted for. Results showthat 4340 steel, which is strain-rate insensitive, has no significantchange in toughness with loading rate. Measurable toughness dependenceon loading rate is found for HY-100 and tungsten, which are approximately15 percent tougher under dynamic conditions. The SAE-01 tool steel showsa significant increase (50 percent) in fracture toughness for dynamicover static loading.</TEXT></DOC>
