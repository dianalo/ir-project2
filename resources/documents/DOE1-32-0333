<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-32-0333 </DOCNO><TEXT>Three types of black coal from India were used as components of cokingmixtures: type A strongly caking coal, type B strongly coking coal, typeC medium caking coal. Content of fractions below 3 mm ranged from 75%to 85%. The following mixtures were used: 17.5% type A, 17.5% type Band 45% type C coal or 35% type A, 15% type B and 35% type C coal (withother components). Use of selective crushing with pneumatic separationimproved mechanical and physical coke properties. Content of mineralmatter in large coal grains decreased, distribution of mineral matterin the coking mixtures was more regular. Coke compression strength increasedwhile coke wear index declined. Properties of the 3 coal types from Indiaas well as physical and mechanical coke properties depending on mixturetype and use of selective crushing are analyzed. 4 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
