Resultswere analyzed according to the single-pool (combined enrichments) orthe two-accessible pools models. After 20-22 h of fasting, ketone bodyturnover rate was 30-50 mumol.kg-1.min-1, a rate achieved after severaldays of fasting in adults. At low ketosis, acetoacetate was the ketonebody preferentially synthesized de novo and utilized irreversibly. Whenketosis increased, acetoacetate irreversible disposal was not enhanced,since it was largely converted into beta-OHB, whereas beta-OHB irreversibledisposal was very much increased. The single-pool and two-pool modelsgave similar ketone body turnover rates when [{sup 13}C]AcAc was thetracer, whereas the use of beta-[{sup 2}H3]OHB gave some more divergentresults, especially at low ketosis. These studies demonstrate that ketogenesisis very active in short-term fasted children and that the use of a combinedinfusion of [{sup 13}C]AcAc and beta-[{sup 2}H3]OHB is a convenient wayto give insight into individual ketone body kinetics.</TEXT></DOC>
