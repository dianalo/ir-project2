(competition in the computerindustry) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Serlin, Omri.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Competition in the microprocessor industry is producing a majorupheaval as both Intel and Motorola develop new 32-bit CISC chips.andO;Intel's 80486 and Motorola's 68040 are expected to compete notonly against each other but also against the new RISC technology.andO;The new chips achieve performance levels matching or surpassingthose claimed for RISC chips while retaining upward compatibility.andO;RISC claims are in danger of being refuted in the chip market,raising the possibility that the entire phenomenon may be apassing fad.andP;  Intel itself is complicating the issues byintroducing its RISC-like 860 and 960 chips at the same time asthe 486, arguing that they are suited for different applications.andO;The workstation and supercomputer markets are also experiencingheated competition with the introduction of Sun's SPARCstation 1and NEC's attempts to challenge Cray Research in thesupercomputing field.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Intel Corp.
