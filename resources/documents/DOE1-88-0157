Spontaneous decays are also affected. Sucheffects near a single plane mirror are reasonably familiar; between parallelmirrors (separation L) they are now becoming measurable, mainly in Rydbergstates. They are interesting also to theory, partly because they raisequestions about the role of classical and other interpretations in quantumphysics. For L small compared to the important transition wavelengths,frequency shifts in neutral atoms are essentially electrostatic (unretarded),and of order 1/L/sup 3/. For large L, they are conditioned by retardation,of order (1/L) log L, and subject to weak but peculiar resonance effectswhen L is tuned to a downward transition wavelength. Some interpretationsemerge by hindsight, but seem to have little predictive power.</TEXT></DOC>
