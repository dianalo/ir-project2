He called on federal Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer toaddress Parliament's environmental committee, which is to examinethe incident at a hearing on Wednesday.   Schaefer also demanded stricter regulatory guidelines dealingwith reactor safety.   The calls from the Social Democrats and the environmentalistGreens Party followed disclosure Monday that personnel at the Biblisnuclear power plant near Frankfurt had overlooked a malfunction inthe reactor's cooling system for 15 hours in December 1987.   Officials on Monday confirmed that Biblis workers scrambled tocorrect a malfunctioning valve for a reactor cooling system hoursafter the problem was first detected. But they denied there couldhave been a dangerous loss of coolant or that there was a cover-up.   Acknowledgment of the accident came after the U.S. magazineNucleonics Week issued a report on the malfunction.   Manfred Popp, state secretary in the Hesse state Ministry forEnvironment and Nuclear Safety, said Monday that on December 16,1987, a valve in one of four cooling systems at the 1,200-megawattfacility remained open after the reactor was restarted.   A ``technical defect'' had kept the valve open, Popp said.   He said a light went on indicating the valve was open, but thatworkers ``apparently didn't take it seriously.'' Popp said thereactor was operating normally and there was no other sign the valvewas open. A second valve in the cooling system was operatingproperly, he said.   According to Popp, the third shift noticed the valve had notclosed and in response began shutting down the reactor.   Popp said a ``few liters'' of radioactive steam were releasedinto the air when the second valve was opened slightly to takepressure off the malfunctioning one.   But he said the release was far below the level of radioactiveemissions permitted by law and the reactor was safely shut downagain.   The West German Federation for Environment and Protection ofNature said ``the incident in Biblis ... could have come within ahair of a serious nuclear accident ...''   But Popp insisted: ``There was never any danger of a nuclearmeltdown.'' Environment Minister Toepfer said the incident wasreported to authorities in accordance with government regulations.   He said the incident was rated for ``urgent'' attention byregulatory authorities at the time.   Toepfer said about 12 such ``urgent'' incidents are listed eachyear for investigation.   He said new control measures to avoid similar incidents have beenimplemented and others are under consideration.   The Biblis reactor, located in the Rhine River valley about 30miles south of Frankfurt, first went on line in 1974.</TEXT></DOC>
