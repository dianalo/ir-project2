The West German government called the breakup of the spy ring,which gave the KGB secret data from 12 countries including theUnited States, ``a major blow'' to the Soviets.   In a four-page statement, chief federal prosecutor Kurt Rebmannsaid it was the first time his office had prosecuted hackers forendangering national security.   The men, identified only by their first names and last initial,were indicted ``on suspicion of espionage activities for the Sovietintelligence agency KGB,'' Rebmann said. The defendents were PeterC. and Markus H. of Hanover, and Dirk B. of West Berlin, he said.   The men were arrested in March. Peter C. and Dirk B. are inprison, while Markus H. has been released pending trial, Rebmannsaid. There was no indication when the trial would begin.   The full range of information the Soviets received is not known,but the espionage activities, first detected by a U.S. computerspecialist, had been in operation since at least September, 1986,Rebmann said.   The Soviets paid about $49,000 for the information, he said.   The hackers gave the Soviets programs and passwords for computersystems in industrial and military areas. They also gave Moscow a``Security pack'' designed to prevent unauthorized computerbreak-ins, Rebmann said.   The three men broke into computers in West Germany, the UnitedStates, France, Britain, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Austria, Spain,the Netherlands, Canada, Japan, and the British colony of Hong Kong,he said.   Among the systems to which the hackers gained access was a keyU.S. Defense Department computer known as Optimus, according to WestGermany's ARD television.   Other computers affected included some used by NASA and defenseresearchers, as well as computers tied to nuclear weapons and energyresearch in the United States, ARD said.   The defendant Peter C. delivered his Soviet contact agent``Serge'' information in about 25 separate meetings over the courseof 2{ years in Communist East Berlin, Rebmann said.</TEXT></DOC>
