The relationship between molecularstructure and C-C rupture processes is discussed. Characteristic differencewas found between the radiolysis of butylcycloalkanes with C{sub 3}-C{sub4} and C{sub 5}-C{sub 6} rings: in the former case the rings, while inthe latter the quarternary or tertiary carbons facilitate the decomposition.The results were interpreted on the basis of stereochemistry of the molecules.</TEXT></DOC>
