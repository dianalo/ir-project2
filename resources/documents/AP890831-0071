Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, at a weekly briefing,also said U.S. sanctions had ``infringed upon China's dignity'' andthat the United States must be held responsible for deterioratingties between the countries.   Also today, the official press reported that the government istightening control of the economy and cracking down on profiteeringin scarce materials and income tax evasion.   Li said claims by Amnesty International that a ``wave ofrepression'' in China followed the June 3-4 military attack onstudent-led protesters in Beijing ``are entirely ungrounded andunreasonable.''   He said that during the attack ``an extremely small number ofpeople used terrorist means and took violent actions in an attemptto overthrow the legitimate government. ... That the Chinesegovernment according to law arrested those criminals and sentencedthem to imprisonment is entirely legitimate and justified.''   ``No country or organization has the right to interfere in anissue that is purely another country's internal affair,'' Li said.   Amnesty said Wednesday it had sent Premier Li Peng a telexmessage urging the Chinese government to ``stop using judicialkilling as a political tool'' and to release all ``prisoners ofconscience.''   A statement released by the human rights group's headquarters inLondon said at least 1,000 people were killed in the military attackon Beijing.   The government has said about 200 died in the crackdown.   The statement added: ``There was strong evidence that theauthorities had taken a deliberate decision after the army massacresin early June to carry out secret executions but also to publicizecertain death sentences in order to cow political opposition.''   The report said the number of people arrested as a result of theprotests may be much higher than the official figure of 4,000.   Asked whether China has any political prisoners, Foreign Ministryspokesman Li replied: ``The Chinese government always attachesimportance to human rights and protection of civil rights accordingto law. There's no such thing as political persecution in China andtherefore there is no such thing accordingly as politicalprisoners.''   China says students and other pro-democracy activists who havebeen arrested were guilty of counterrevolutionary crimes, but deniesthey are political prisoners.   Li said current tensions between China and the United States``have been caused by the deep involvement of the United States inChina's internal affairs and by its taking the lead to imposesanctions against China which damaged China's interests andinfringed upon China's dignity.''   He said any improvement in bilateral relations ``depends on thepolicies and actions of the United States.''   Following the military crackdown, Washington stopped arms salesand other military exchanges with China and suspended high-levelcontacts. It also has urged international lending organizations toput off providing new credit to the Beijing government.   Reports in the official media today said the government isreasserting controls over the distribution and pricing of rawmaterials.   The state also will launch a campaign against what it says isrampant tax evasion among the nation's 14.5 million privately ownedenterprises, the China Daily reported.   Xie Mingan, an official at the Ministry of Materials andEquipment, said the state will tighten controls on prices of someraw materials such as coal, rolled steel and non-ferrous metals.   He said redundant middlemen will be eliminated, illegal dealersand officials trading power for money will be disciplined, and statesupplies of materials to production enterprises will be maintained.   Decentralization of controls over raw materials, one aspect ofthe economic reforms, has led to a chaotic situation of hoarding,speculation and price-gouging. Middlemen, often with links toinfluential party and government officials, buy up scarce materialsat low government-set prices and sell them for huge profits on freemarkets to desperate factories.   Jin Xin, director of the State Tax Administration, said at aconference Wednesday that if the problem of tax evasion amongprivate businessmen is not solved, ``It will certainly sap themorale of the dominant working classes and bring adverse effects onthe enthusiasm of intellectuals.''</TEXT></DOC>
