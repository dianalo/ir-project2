The union, formed in 1983, includes right-of-center parties from26 countries and holds a meeting of party leaders every two years.   Figures who attended the conference in Tokyo, hosted by JapanesePrime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, included Vice President Dan Quayle,British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister HarriHolkeri of Finland and party leaders from countries in Europe, LatinAmerica, the Caribbean and the Pacific region _ most of them in theopposition.   Quayle, whose speeches at the conference stressed the need tokeep defenses strong and avoid complacency, spent today touring U.S.military bases in Japan, which is home to about 64,000 U.S. troops.   The vice president will hold meetings with Kaifu and otherJapanese leaders Monday and Tuesday before flying to the Philippines.   Although delegates from Austria, on the frontier with the rapidlychanging countries in Eastern Europe, called for a program ofcomprehensive aid to East Bloc reformers, the final conferencedocument did not go so far.   ``Only the societies that free themselves totally of thestructures, rigidities and follies of socialism will in the longerrun be able to share in the new prosperity of the future,'' it said.   ``We therefore resolve to give support to all those who acceptthese challenges and who will embark upon a program of peacefulchange towards freedom and democracy,'' the statement said.   It said the West should not subsidize failed socialist economies,and that increased debt would only hinder progress towardfree-market economies.   ``However, the West must be prepared to give financial incentiveswhich support real changes in these economies, introducing marketeconomy and other structural reforms,'' it said.   The statement also called for more joint East-West businessventures.   Mrs. Thatcher, at a news conference Friday before she left forMoscow and talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, saidshe did not think the stage was set for something like the MarshallPlan, the massive U.S. aid program that helped Western Europerecover from World War II.   But she said West European countries, individually and in theEuropean Economic Community, had taken steps to aid Poland andHungary, and that she expected the International Monetary Fund andthe World Bank eventually to help.   Andrew Peacock, head of the opposition Liberal Party of Australiaand new chairman of the organization of conservatives, said thegroup was proposing programs to assist advocates of change in theEast Bloc.   While the conference statement praised Gorbachev's reforms, itsaid there was no guarantee he would succeed. ``We thereforereaffirm our absolute determination to maintain adequate defensesand our continuing support for the doctrine of nuclear deterrence,which has kept the peace in Europe for over 40 years.''   The statement noted, however, that some communist leaders haverecognized a link between economic freedom and political freedom andsaid this showed a commitment to reform. ``We are convinced thatthis new approach will diminish mistrust, thus leading to markedimprovement in East-West relations,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
