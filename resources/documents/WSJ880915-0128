But Woolworth shares rose to 260 pence ($4.37), up just one penny, in late trading on London's stock exchange yesterday.    Profit after taxes and minorities but before exceptional items rose 95% to #52.7 million from #27.1 million.    The buoyant retail sales market gave Woolworth total sales of #1.18 billion, up 32% from #893 million. </TEXT></DOC>
