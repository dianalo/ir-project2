The sizeof the mirrors is .30 x .30 m for SiO and Si/sub 2/O/sub 3/ with 0.003m substrate thickness. The SiO/sub 2/ mirrors were obtained by evaporatingPirex glass with an electron gun in a small evaporator. In order to obtaina higher reflectance in the SiO mirrors, the SiO was evaporated in anatmosphere of oxygen at pressure 10/sup -4/ Torr to produce a coatingof Si/sub 2/O/sub 3/. The highest measured specular reflectance of thesemirrors was 0.86.</TEXT></DOC>
