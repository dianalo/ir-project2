Analysts described OfficeVision as an important part of IBM'sattempt to duplicate and go beyond the successful strategies ofrivals such as Digital Equipment Corp. and Apple Computer Inc.   ``It is the largest applications software announcement in IBM'shistory. Nothing else is close,'' said Joseph M. Guglielmi, IBMvice president and president of the Application Systems Division.   OfficeVision conceals the differences between computers fromusers, harnessing mid-sized computers and big mainframes to work intandem with personal computers.   OfficeVision will be welcomed most by companies that are heavyusers of IBM computers, while providing fewer advantages tocompanies with a mix of machines, analysts predicted.   ``It's a much-needed announcement,'' said Bob Djurdjevic ofAnnex Research Inc. in Phoenix, who attended the announcement inNew York. ``I think they took a page out of DEC's book.''   OfficeVision is another step in overcoming the problems IBMcreated for itself in the 1960s and 1970s, when it introduced abewildering variety of machines that could not run the samesoftware.   Digital, IBM's nearest rival, disparaged the announcement inadvance, saying the capabilities IBM is beginning to introduce havelong been available on its own Vax series of computers.   But Guglielmi said OfficeVision is superior in its ability tomix and share data between programs and in its capacity to plug inprograms that are developed by other companies and have the samelook and feel.   Fourteen software companies including Microsoft Corp. and LotusDevelopment Corp. said today they would develop new versions oftheir programs that would ``snap in'' to the OfficeVision family.   According to IBM, OfficeVision will make it possible for someoneto tap all the computers of a company ``simply by manipulatingpictures on a workstation screen.''   For example, IBM said, someone could get human-resources figuresout of a mainframe and salary figures from a mid-size computer,then combine them all on the screen of a personal computer, withoutneeding to know where the information originated or how it wasdelivered.   Programs written for OfficeVision all will have the same ``lookand feel,'' saving users from having to relearn basic functionsevery time they try a new program. That sameness is one of the keysto success of Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh.   To take full advantage of the new OfficeVision software,customers will have to buy a new version of the base-layer softwarefor personal computers, known as Operating System-2 ExtendedEdition 1.2.   So far, IBM is the only company that makes personal computerscapable of using that particular version of base-layer software.Other companies have indicated they intend to clone the IBMmachine, using IBM patent licenses.   By linking its own brand of personal computers more tightly withthe rest of its product line, IBM is encouraging companies thatrely on IBM's big machines to buy IBM personal computers as well.   The new PC base software will be available this fall. TheOfficeVision software will be available this year and next,depending on the computer.   Prices of OfficeVision range from a one-time charge of $210 fora personal computer in a low-cost network to a one-time charge of$51,000 and annual charges of $9,000 for the version that goes inIBM's biggest mainframes.</TEXT></DOC>
