About 7,500 to 8,000 seals have died in the epidemic, which hasbeen linked to the virus that causes distemper in dogs, according toLenie 't Hart of the Seal Clinic in this northern Dutch village.   The clinic is Europe's biggest hospital for seals.   Before the epidemic broke out in April off the Danish island ofAnholt, there were 10,000 seals in the North Sea, Ms. 't Hart toldThe Associated Press.   The epidemic gradually made its way south along the Danish andWest German North Sea coast and eventually ended up in the WaddenSea, the shallow waters off the northern Netherlands.   Ms. 't Hart said seals still are dying of the viral infection,which undermines the animals' immune system and exposes them topneumonia or liver infection.   ``They're not going to disappear'' from the North Sea, Ms. 'tHart said, but she added, ``It's just going to take 10 to 14 yearsbefore the seal population is back where it was before. That alsomeans we can't afford another disaster.''   Animal health officials have developed a vaccine against thevirus, but they said it's unfeasible to vaccinate all animals livingin the wild. Only those seals taken into the clinic for care arebeing given the vaccine.</TEXT></DOC>
