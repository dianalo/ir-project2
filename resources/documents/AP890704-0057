The 1.8 million-member church voted to move its headquarters toCleveland from New York City to get closer to its membership base.It also elected the Rev. Paul H. Sherry of Chicago over the Rev.Yvonne Delk of Union City, N.J.   Sherry said his goal is to maintain the denomination'stheological integrity.   ``We are a church. We are not a political party or social serviceorganization,'' he said.   Nonetheless, the 700-plus delegates were to end the six-day synodtoday with votes on measures including a statement criticizingtreatment of the poor in the United States.   On Monday, the UCC, considered one of the most liberal of themainline denominations, resolved by acclamation to deplore Monday'sU.S. Supreme Court ruling that restricted the right to an abortion.   ``Historically, the United Church of Christ has stood for women'srights, particularly freedom of choice in abortion,'' said Rev.Avery Post, the retiring president.   The vote to move caused a rift between those who wanted to getcloser to the UCC's membership base and those who feared diminishingthe 32-year-old denomination's role in the ecumenical community,largely based in New York.   Delegates voted 448-294 for the move, which supporters said wouldfree more of its money for missions by saving millions of dollars inrent and other costs.   Presbyterian and Lutheran denominations also have left New YorkCity in the past two years.   Delk, if elected, would have become the first woman and firstblack to lead a major U.S. denomination. The election was the firstcontest for a UCC executive post in 20 years. The vote tally was notdisclosed.   The UCC president has no doctrinal power over the denomination'smembers, but the position is widely viewed as an importanttheological platform.   The denomination was formed in the 1957 merger of theCongregational Christian Churches and the Evangelical and ReformedChurch in Cleveland.</TEXT></DOC>
