Foran artist -- and Paul is one, having published poetry in the New Yorker andelsewhere -- &quot;the gesture might be brilliant, the statement exact, theexecution perfect,&quot; but the world invariably remains the same: Few people takenotice of the artist's work. Its creator, as a result, lives with a sense offutility.;    That, in a nutshell, is the premise underlying &quot;Catapult: Harryand I Build a Siege Weapon,&quot; an amusing tale in which Paul recounts hisattempt both to live up to, and literally make something of, a $500 artsgrant. This description may make Paul, a San Francisco writer, seem a cynic,but he more closely resembles an innocent; Paul wants to have fun, sure, butat bottom he's quite serious about the catapult and the issues it suggests.;   Why do some people have the almost visceral urge to throw rocks? What makesso many machines, however violent, attractive? How do unlikely friendshipswork, like that between Paul the writer and his pal, Harry the craftsman? Whatis work, what is play, and must we really distinguish between them? Paulneither poses nor answers these questions directly, but they form thelandscape in which &quot;Catapult&quot; is built.;    The book is something of ashaggy-dog story, for Paul spends less than half of it describing the actualconstruction of the Harry-designed, crossbow-like catapult. He doesn't seemparticularly interested in the physics and engineering involved; it'sfrequently hard to tell from his descriptions just what's going on. But&quot;Catapult&quot; works nonetheless, for Paul lets the weapon define his life, takinghim into ideas and orbits he would never have encountered otherwise.;   That's the result, mostly, of Harry's presence. Although he worries aboutbecoming the project's second banana -- &quot;I'm not going to be the Igor,&quot; Harrysays more than once -- he's guide as much as foil. Earthy, practical,taciturn, Harry is everything Paul is not, and soon turns out to be moreimportant to the catapult project than its originator.;    Paul's notion,which originated when he picked up a chunk of Precambrian quartzite in Utah,is to fling rocks into the Pacific from the abandoned military battery in theMarin County headlands overlooking the Golden Gate. The ostensible purpose ofthe project was artistic -- &quot;I would observe this impulse to build acatapult,&quot; writes Paul, who once drafted grant proposals for a living -- butthe impetus actually ran much deeper. &quot;What had I made lately?&quot; he askshimself early on, and can only come up with &quot;a paragraph, a sandwich&quot; --nothing solid, in short, nothing with the feel of permanence. Paul enlistsHarry as the project's resident mechanic, and the adventure is on.;   &quot;Catapult&quot; incorporates a history of rock-throwing. Paul describes Archimedes'invention (re-invention, actually) of the catapult in ancient Syracuse; EdwardI's 14th-century siege of a Scottish castle with a trebuchet called Ludgar,the Warwolf; the Palestinian intifada that still makes headlines. Indeed, theubiquity of the catapult throughout history can be deduced from the fact thatPaul uncovers almost a score of words (besides trebuchet, there's ballista,calabra, esprinda, fronda, manganum, petrary, scorpion and tormentum) todescribe the device's various incarnations.;    The book provides modern folkhistory, too. Just about everyone to whom Paul describes his project seems tohave a catapult story -- the environmental sculptor who shot flares from agiant crossbow, the stage designer commissioned to make a catapult for rocksinger Ozzy Osbourne, the light-sleeping baker who built one to fling dough atlow-flying planes. Although these stories are often funny, they serve Paul'spoint that weapons, for whatever reason, are always with us -- and thathistory is written by those with the best weapons. &quot;I began wondering if Ihadn't gotten the terms wrong,&quot; Paul writes, starting to think that thecatapult created history, rather than the other way around.;    The choicestparts of &quot;Catapult,&quot; however, occur during Paul's out-of-character forays intothe blue-collar world, where he meets people rarely encountered in books.There's the lumber salvager who once helped tear down his own high school, andwho sells Paul and Harry a beam, cheap, for the catapult's stock. A machinistdrills holes in the truck leaf-springs forming the catapult's bow, and charges$200 -- a lot to pay, Paul thinks, for getting exactly nothing (especiallysince the holes proved unnecessary). A metal-shop worker bends the catapult'ssteel-plate trigger base, while drinking a post-work beer, for free.;    Thereare some nice white-collar encounters, too, the most memorable being one withPaul's accountant. Having spent more than $800 of his own money on thecatapult, Paul wants to know whether his expenses are tax-deductible. Theaccountant assures him that they are, saying &quot;building a weapon is somethingthe feds will understand.&quot;;    Perhaps the best, even unavoidable, way todescribe &quot;Catapult&quot; is to call it disarming. One can't help submitting to itscharms; the book doesn't always make sense -- Paul's flights of fancyoccasionally go beyond the pale -- but the tone is generally right on target.Paul's greatest strength as a writer lies in his eye for the telling detail,particularly those that initially seem irrelevant. That's well illustrated bythe account of his father's experience as a bombardier during World War II.The father never talked about the war, but the son eventually found Lt. Paul'sair force locker -- and in it, hundreds of the cotter pins that had to bepulled from bombs in order to arm them. Each pin was labeled with the name ofthe place bombed and the date, and some carried notes; one read &quot;Hamburg, July28, 1943, Some Flak.&quot; Paul later learned the inscription referred to anenormous air strike code-named Operation Gomorrah, but thankfully, thatrevelation prompts no speech. It would have been superfluous, in any case, forit is already clear that building a catapult has taught Paul, as bombingtaught his father, to take weapons personally.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CHRIS GOODRICH  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910714  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  19  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,097  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday July 14, 199100196121,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
