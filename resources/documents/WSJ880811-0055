Despite the increase in the discount rate to 6.5% from 6% by the Federal Reserve Board, banking industry experts expect a lag in a consumer rate increase.    Big banks will be &quot;playing the spread&quot; on the consumer CD rates for the next week or two, said Norberto Mehl, publisher of Banxquote Online, a New York-based information service. Although some smaller, more rate-competitive savings and loans have already increased CD rates, &quot;it is not unusual for the consumer rates to lag&quot; at most bigger banks, especially when they're poised to go up, Mr. Mehl said.    Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla., interest rate newsletter, said banks &quot;didn't jump through hoops to raise savings yields 24 hours after absorbing the news of the Federal discount rate.&quot; This week's numbers showed &quot;no new stronger upward movement in savings yields than the past few weeks,&quot; he added.    Other analysts said banks are purposely slow to respond to rate changes, because consumers don't move their funds as quickly as do institutional investors.    Large depositors have already seen a boost in rates. &quot;Jumbo CD rates react instantly&quot; because institutional investors are more rate sensitive, Mr. Mehl said.    Jumbo CDs, generally those with denominations over $50,000, were up an average of 10 basis points, or one-tenth of a point, from last week, Banxquote said.    Banxquote said the average yield for 30-day retail certificates of deposit were almost unchanged at 6.24% yesterday, from 6.25% the week before. Retail, or individual savings CDs, are generally regarded as those with denominations of under $50,000.    Yields for longer-term CDs rose moderately. The average six-month CD rose to 7.2% yesterday from 7.16% the week before. The average one-year CD yield was up three basis points, or three one-hundredths of a point, at 7.54%. Longer term, 2 1/2-year CDs were up to 7.72% from 7.69%. Five-year yields rose two basis points, to 8.26%.    The average yield for money-market accounts rose sharply to 5.89% from 5.8% last week, according to Banxquote.    Analysts said the money-market account rate boost, however, didn't reflect general trends for funds. The average yield reflected special promotions by two Texas banks. Banxquotes called the rate surge an &quot;aberration.&quot; More typically, Bank Rate Monitor said rates for money market accounts rose a tiny bit, to 5.83% from 5.82% a week earlier.    Banks played down the impact of the increased discount rate on consumer CD rates. A spokeswoman for Citicorp said: &quot;If the trend (at other banks) is to raise rates, we would raise rates. But we didn't make any moves today. We will wait a week, two weeks, to see.&quot; She said CD rates depend more on market conditions than on the discount rate.    Chemical Bank, which evaluates its CD yields every Tuesday, raised most of its CD rates effective yesterday. But the rate increases were slight: a seven-month CD rate rose to 7.6% from 7.55%, for example, while a 13-month rate rose to 7.75% from 7.65%. Some maturities, such as three-month and six-month certificates, didn't change at all. A spokesman said the rate increases were small because &quot;rates have already gone up quite a bit in the past few weeks.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
