W. deKlerk declared ``a new chapter'' in South African history Thursdayand wept before committing the white rulers to sharing limited powerwith the black majority.   Conservatives among the nation's 5 million whites condemned theplan as a sham to surrender control to blacks. Clive Derby-Lewis ofthe Conservative Party likened the plan to ``the sales talk of anunscrupulous car dealer.''   Spokesmen for the 28 million disenfranchised blacks said theproposal uses ``new labels for old dogmas'' as a ploy to retainwhite rule and impress foreign leaders. Anglican Archbishop DesmondTutu said the proposal would not do away with apartheid.   Tears brimmed over de Klerk's eyes as 1,500 delegates gave him astanding ovation when he opened the governing party's congress withpromises the Nationalists, responsible for 41 years of apartheidrule, can lead South Africa back into the international community byending many racist practices.   ``We have reached a great moment of truth in the history of ourcountry. A new chapter is to be written,'' he said at Pretoria CityHall.   But de Klerk resolutely avoided specifics. He said the form of afuture government and constitution must be negotiated.   Although the party's manifesto seeks to avoid using race todefine political groups, de Klerk clung to the principle, promisingthe Nationalists will ``not forsake the whites'' and declaring``group security is a prerequisite to constructive cooperation.''   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the nation's largest,said:   ``We are insulted, if not surprised, that the NP thinks that thepeople of South Africa will be so easily fooled by new labels forold dogmas.   ``The bottom line is that (de Klerk) and the NP remain wedded towhite minority rule in the form of group rights.''   The congress, beginning its campaign for Sept. 6 parliamentaryelections after which de Klerk is designated to replace PresidentP.W. Botha, adopted an ``action plan'' that envisions giving blacksa direct vote in national affairs within five years.   It calls for removing criminal penalties for violating laws onsegregated housing, more government subsidies for multiracialschools and a bill of rights.   The Nationalists' declared goal is to provide blacks with anational political voice in a way that preserves rights of whitesand other minorities. De Klerk made it clear the plan will notencompass majority rule.   But the reform proposals could cost the Nationalistsparliamentary seats to the pro-apartheid Conservative Party.   De Klerk, who just returned from a visit with European leadersand is expected to meet President Bush next month, sees reform as away to end South Africa's isolation and the economic punishment ithas brought.   ``Our cause is just and the doors must be open. We will not haveto go crawling back. We will walk in proudly and with our heads heldhigh,'' he said to uproarious applause.   A less enthusiastic ovation followed his brief tribute to theabsent Botha. Relations between the two men have been strained sinceMarch, when Botha resigned as party chief following a stroke and wasshocked to find party leaders also wanted him to resign from thepresidency.   The congress clearly signaled the end of the Botha era _ from newparty logos and slogans festooning the hall to de Klerk's bluntstatement at a news conference:   ``President Botha is no longer active in politics. He prefers itthat way and we respect his wishes.''   He went on to tell reporters: ``We still have one big challengewhich we face. We've already received a mandate from our (white)electorate for power-sharing with blacks. The final test is to workout a system which will enable us to do that on the basis ofnon-domination.''   He said the government will not scrap two cornerstones ofapartheid _ the Population Registration Act requiring raceclassification and the Group Areas Act designating segregatedresidential areas _ unless they are replaced by other protectionsfor those who want to live separately.   Archbishop Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for hisopposition to apartheid, said on a visit to Denmark that noeffective change can take place in South Africa while the PopulationRegistration Act remains.   He said the government ``wouldn't remove that, because the basisof everything is still race, and power still resides with the whiterace.''   In London, a leader of the outlawed African National Congressguerrilla movement called the platform an advance, but from a wrongposition.   ``It's a step forward ... but the position is wrong because itcontinues to define people as black and white and not as the peopleof South Africa,'' said international affairs secretary Thabo Mbeki.</TEXT></DOC>
