Lawyers for the former White House aide said the defense embarkedon a background check of juror Tara Leigh King after North's trialended in a guilty verdict on three criminal charges May 4.   King's failure to acknowledge in a pre-trial questionnaire courtproceedings involving four brothers and sisters has moved backNorth's sentencing, which had been scheduled for Friday, to July 5.One of her brothers had pleaded guilty to armed robbery.   Granting a request from North, U.S. District Court Judge GerhardA. Gesell will hold a hearing Wednesday to focus on King and herfailure to disclose the background information to the court.   The defense was alerted to allegations about King on May 5 when alocal TV news reporter said King admitted smoking crack cocaine upuntil four months before the North trial, according to the defense'scourt filing Friday.   North wrote all the jurors May 11 seeking to question them. Fivedays later ``during an interview with a source ... we were told thata brother ... had drug problems, had been picked up by the policeand had been involved in a prosecution,'' the court filing said.   North's lawyers hired a detective agency, The InvestigativeGroup, which on May 30 turned over to North documents on criminalproceedings involving two of King's brothers and turned overadditional material on another brother and a sister on June 8.   King responded negatively on a pre-trial questionnaire when askedwhether she or any member of her immediate family ever had beeninvolved in a court proceeding or in an investigation.   North's court filing said ``there is absolutely no basis'' forsuggesting that the defense knew about King's background before theverdict in the North case.   The prosecution said a defendant ``cannot learn of jurormisconduct during the trial, gamble on a favorable verdict byremaining silent and then complain in a post-verdict motion.''   North's lawyers said King has refused to talk to them.   On Friday, Gesell appointed a local attorney, Vincent Alto, torepresent King in the proceeding.</TEXT></DOC>
