It said that about 79,000 invitations were submitted to Sovietauthorities last year, the highest annual figure since thebeginning of the mass Soviet Jewish emigration in the late 1960s.   An invitation from relatives living abroad is a necessary stepfor a person wishing to emigrate from the Soviet Union.   Uri Gordon, head of the Jewish Agency's immigration department,was quoted by the radio as estimating that Soviet Jewish emigrationwould reach 50,000 this year.   But the radio quoted Gordon as saying that 90 percent of theemigrants are likely to choose the United States and other Westerncountries instead of Israel.   Last year, the Soviets allowed about 20,000 Jews to emigrate.Only about 2,200 chose to settle in the Jewish state.   In the first three months of 1989, 9,461 Jews were permitted toleave, according to the Washington-based National Conference forSoviet Jewry.</TEXT></DOC>
