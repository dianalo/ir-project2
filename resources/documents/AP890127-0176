Egyptian officials announced this week they planned to declaresovereignty over the Red Sea resort on Sunday.   But Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said Friday thatEgypt apparently would tone down its original declaration and simplyannounce Sunday that Egypt's Tourism Ministry is authorized tohandle talks on purchase of Taba's Israeli-owned luxury hotel.   Israel says it wants more talks on ownership of the hotel and anIsraeli-owned resort village on the 250-acre strip. It says it alsowants more talks on ensuring access for Israeli tourists.   Liel said the two sides discussed the issues but scheduled no newtalks.   Nabil Arabi, head of the Egyptian delegation, said after the endof talks Friday: ``We did not reach any agreement, and we're goingto report that back to our government.''   Egyptian negotiators have argued that Egypt won sovereignty whena panel of international arbitrators determined the location of aseries of border markers Sept. 29.   But the Israelis argue that the arbitrators did not say how theborder should run from the last marker to the sea about 200 yardsaway. If the border is extended in a straight line, Taba falls inEgyptian territory. If it cuts back at a sharp angle, the resortwould be on Israeli land.   Taba has been disputed since Israel refused to hand it back toEgypt in 1982. Israel withdrew from the rest of the Sinai Peninsulaat that time under terms of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty.   Israel captured the Sinai in the 1967 Middle East War.</TEXT></DOC>
