They checkgroceries, play concertos and perform eye surgery. They are fasterthan a speeding bullet and could do serious damage to a locomotive.   Lasers have been the Superman of the electromagnetic spectrumever since 1960, when 33-year-old Theodore H. Maiman of HughesAircraft Co. built the first one from a pink ruby.   As they near their 30th anniversary, though, lasers have switchedfrom comic-book novelties to necessities that preoccupy thetechnology giants of the United States, Europe and Japan.   Lasers are not only in compact disc players and bar-code scannersat checkout counters, they are in the phone system, carryinglong-distance calls over hair-thin glass fibers.   Now, lasers are poised to take a quantum leap. Tiny devicescalled quantum lasers herald an era in which lasers will be morecentral to the technology underlying daily life.   Experts say quantum lasers and their cousins, quantumtransistors, could make possible supercomputers the size ofbaseballs, and television screens of unparalleled clarity that hangon the wall like a painting.   ``Quantum devices are the wave of the future. Almost all of theresearch that goes on involves quantum effects in some way oranother,'' said David V. Lang, director of the solid stateelectronics research lab at ATandamp;T Bell Labs.   Lasers are what some scientists call a ``killer'' technology:Compact discs are killing vinyl records, for example, and nobodyuses copper anymore for long-distance phone lines.   To repeat a familiar story, the Japanese are putting theAmerican-invented killer to use more effectively than Americansthemselves are.   Japan's dominance of mass-market electronics gives its companiesunmatched expertise in making things small, cheap and reliable. Forexample, Japanese companies dominate the market for CD players,which use more lasers than any other product.   ``It's a byproduct of the Japanese decision to invest in consumerelectronics. They'll find an application and find the technology tosolve it. I wish we did it here,'' said Henry Kressel, a venturecapitalist at E.M. Warburg Pincus andamp; Co. Inc. in New York.   Japan's twin towers of strength in lasers and semiconductorscould allow it to build the first computers in which chips areconnected by quantum laser beams instead of electricity. Thatworries companies like International Business Machines Corp., whichis intensively studying quantum well lasers and quantum welltransistors.   At ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories, one of America's foremost laserresearch centers, Alan Huang is hoping to leapfrog the Japanese. Buthe admits the competition is tough: For an early model of his``optical computer'' he had to use a diode laser he took from aJapanese-made CD player.   A laser is a directed needle of light purified to one particularcolor, or wavelength. In contrast, ordinary light is a jumble ofmany wavelengths flying in all directions.   ``Laser'' stands for light amplification by stimulated emissionof radiation. In a cascading effect, photons of light strike anenergized material and stimulate the release of more photons in asynchronized pattern.   The most powerful lasers, big enough for someone to walk inside,are being used to attempt to fuse the nuclei of atoms in flashes ofenergy a million times more intense than a nuclear blast. Sustainednuclear fusion could be a source of clean, plentiful and cheapelectricity.   At the other end of the scale are semiconductor diode lasers, nobigger than a grain of salt _ the kind used in compact disc playersand the phone system. One exotic subspecies is the quantum laser.   Scientists build quantum lasers by ``spray-painting'' atoms in alayer cake of incredibly thin layers, some of which have impuritiesadded.   The impure layers act like walls to trap electrons. Confining somany electrons and their receptors (``holes'') to a tiny space makesit easier to get a cascade of photons going, creating laser light.   If a laser the size of a salt crystal were blown up to the sizeof the World Trade Center in New York, a quantum well would be aboutthe thickness of a rug in an office, said Michael Ettenberg,director of the optoelectronics research lab at the David SarnoffResearch Center in Princeton, N.J.   Quantum lasers are more precise and require less current, andtheir efficiency in converting electricity to light is unmatched.   Spectra Diode Laboratories of San Jose, Calif., recently produced55 watts of continuous wave power from a quantum laser, a recordpower output and power conversion efficiency for a semiconductorlaser, president and chief executive Donald Scifres told TheAssociated Press this past week.   Ophthalmic surgeons have used lasers since 1970 to weld detachedretinas. Later came other medical uses like excising tumors andeliminating cataracts. Today, lasers snaked into the body on opticalfibers clean arteries and destroy urinary-tract stones.   Lasers are used to make pinholes in the nipples of baby bottles,study components of car exhaust and form the three-dimensionalholograms used on credit cards _ and maybe someday dollar bills.   The military has ``Star Wars'' designs for free-electron lasersand powerful X-ray lasers, which physicist Edward Teller hassuggested could be triggered by a nuclear blast.   Laser weapons would most likely be mounted in space: ``Peopletried to shoot laser beams through the sky and what they discoveredwas fog and rain,'' said William Bridges of California Institute ofTechnology.   Quantum well lasers fill only one niche, but an important one.Their speed and efficiency makes them ideal for rapid-firecommunication, initially for long-distance calls, later for linksbetween neighboring computers and eventually for the links betweenchips in computers, said Robert Melcher, a laser expert for IBM inZurich, Switzerland.   ``I've been in the laser game for 25 years now,'' said oneresearcher, Ross A. McFarlane, of Hughes Research Laboratories inMalibu, Calif. ``That (quantum lasers) is where the future lies.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for weekend editions Jan. 21-22.</NOTE></DOC>
