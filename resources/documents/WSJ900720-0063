No decisions have been reached. But broad and narrowlimitations on deductions taken by individuals have beendiscussed in private meetings. Documents that include suchlimitations have been drafted by congressional Democrats andBush administration aides.</LP><TEXT>   The idea of restricting itemized deductions has emergedbecause of the Democrats' demand that any tax package hit thewealthy harder than others. The search for ways to meet thisobjective has intensified as it begins to appear more likelythat the tax plan will be anchored by a big new broad-basedtax on energy, which would hit low-income individuals harderthan those who are better off.   Curbing itemized deductions is an effective way to raisethe tax burden on upperincome Americans. At last count in1986, 43% of all itemized deductions were taken by the 9% oftaxpayers who had adjusted gross income of more than $50,000a year, according to the Internal Revenue Service. At thesame time, however, some of the deductions that might betrimmed are among the most politically popular in the taxcode and have withstood assaults in years past.   Proposals discussed by the budget negotiators range fromreducing all deductions by, for example, 10% to placingceilings on such deductions for the highest-incomeindividuals. The Bush administration has floated the idea oflimiting the amount of deductions taken for state income taxpayments to $15,000 a year.   Other options that have been discussed include restrictingallowable deductions to a percentage of adjusted grossincome, reducing the value of the deductions by applying themagainst only the lower, 15% tax bracket and disallowingdeductions of more than a given dollar figure, say $10,000,for any individual. Another option is to allow deductionsonly if they exceed a certain percentage of income.   &quot;Both sides are looking at (limiting) itemizeddeductions,&quot; a Democratic staffer said. &quot;There are scores ofways to do it.&quot;   Budget summit negotiators met for about two hoursyesterday, their first formal meeting in a week, for whatHouse Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)diplomatically described as &quot;a frank discussion . . . aboutthe difficulty in trying to arrive at an agreement whilepolitical weapons are being used day to day.&quot;   The summit tentatively agreed to reconvene early nextweek. President Bush has invited top congressional leaders tomeet with him on the budget talks Monday.   The Democrats are determined to structure a progressivetax package that hits higher-income taxpayers at least ashard as lower-income people. The Bush administration istrying to find ways to accomplish this without increasing thetop individual tax rate to 33% from the current 28% as theDemocrats want.   For their part, Democrats don't think raising the top rateis enough, particularly if the tax plan includes both excisetaxes and a cut in capital gains taxes, which is sought byPresident Bush and almost exclusively benefits the veryrichest Americans. The excise tax increases most discussedare a broad-based energy tax, tobacco taxes and taxes onalcoholic beverages.   Tax writers note that there is plenty of precedent forplacing limits on deductions. Tax law already allows thededuction for medical expenses only if they exceed 7.5% of anindividual's adjusted gross income. Only 80% of dining andentertainment costs are deductible as a business expense. Anda variety of miscellaneous deductions can be taken only ifthey exceed 2% of adjusted gross income a year.   Congressional aides note that a wholesale scaling back ofdeductions mightn't be needed to achieve a balance in the taxburden between rich and poor. Specific deductions could betargeted for cutback, as the Bush administration hasprivately suggested. Or, they said, poor people could beaided by increases in the refundable earned-income tax creditand an increase in the standard deduction taken by taxpayerswho don't itemize. Increases in those tax benefits are beingconsidered on their own merits.   Considerable revenue can be raised by curtailingdeductions. By way of illustration, the respectedCongressional Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated thatlimiting the deduction for mortgage-interest payments to$12,000 a year for an individual and $20,000 a year for ajoint filer would raise $600 million in the first year.Restricting the deduction of state and local taxes to 9% ofadjusted gross income would raise $700 million in the firstyear.   Talk about any such restrictions has compelled lobbyistsfor a number of interests to step up their efforts on CapitolHill, particularly those who represent state and localgovernments. Real estate interests also are considering howto defend their tax breaks.   Judging from the past, their chances of success could behigh. Speaking of previous battles over deductions, Rep. BillFrenzel (R., Minn.) said, &quot;If they didn't go through then,they may have some difficulty going through now.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
