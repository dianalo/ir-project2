These organic acidsare emitted directly into the atmosphere from sources such as motor vehiclesand can be formed in the atmosphere from the photochemical oxidationof a variety of organic compounds. Organic acids may provide a significantsource of precipitation acidity in rural and some urban areas. More recently,health effects researchers have hypothesized that low molecular weightorganic acids may be substantial contributors to the total acidity offog droplets in urban areas such as Los Angeles, with potentially importantimplications on human health effects from acidic fogs. In order to understandmore completely the photochemical processes that can lead to the formationof low molecular weight organic acids in the gas and aerosol phases duringurban photochemical episodes, as well as to assess the levels, the measurementof organic acids in ambient air is essential. However, atmospheric concentrationsof organic acids have been measured only on a very limited bases, typicallyusing an alkaline medium (filter or impinger solution) following a particulateprefilter for the collection, and analyzing an extract of the filteror the impinger solution for the acids. For example, Kawamura et al/sup1/ used the filter technique and found an array of C/sub 1/ - C/sub 10/organic acids in Southern California, with acetic and formic being themost abundant. This type of sampling approach using an alkali mediumcan suffer from some serious artifacts.</TEXT></DOC>
