The traditions and customs, which play a strong role at alllevels of Japanese society, may pose other hurdles for the 12politicians, bureaucrats or business executives charged withbribery in the influence-peddling scandal known as the Recruitaffair. The first of five separate trials begins Friday.   ``The Japanese judiciary system may look similar to that ofordinary Western democratic countries on the surface, but itdiffers a great deal in substance,'' Itakura said.   In a typical criminal case, suspects are required to undergo aphysical examination completely naked at the beginning of policeinvestigation following arrest.   Police can question suspects for up to 48 hours before sendingthem to prosecutors, who have 20 days to interrogate them beforefiling formal charges with the court. The suspect is permitted tohave a lawyer present during interrogation.   An arrested person has no chance of being released on bail untilprosecutors complete their investigation.   Hiromasa Ezoe, the central figure in the Recruit bribery case,was arrested Feb. 13 and held until June 6, when he was released on$1.4 million bail. He was charged with seven counts of bribery ofpoliticians and public officials.   Defendants do not enter a formal plea until their trials start,and there is no plea bargaining beforehand. There is no chance tosway a jury _ trials are decided by a single judge at the districtcourt level _ and judges hardly ever give innocent verdicts.   ``The chance that the court will find a suspect innocent is onlyone out of 15,000,'' said Itakura. ``I think it reflects ahomogeneous society where judges, prosecutors and defense attorneysall share a similar sense of justice and fairness.''   If Ezoe's trial goes by the usual pattern in Japan, his 18defense lawyers will try to draw the case out and reduce thepenalty after the virtually inevitable guilty verdict.   Since there is no plea bargaining, a defendant may want to pleadinnocent, but a judge may take that as a sign of a lack ofrepentance and impose a stiffer sentence.   ``Once you are arrested for wrongdoing, it is hard to expectfairness of the Western standard in this country,'' said Itakura.``I guess it depends on how you define fairness, but in general,the Japanese judiciary system is made in such a way that tends tobe quite cruel to criminals.''</TEXT></DOC>
