SUNY's administrativebureaucracy, ensconced in a Le Corbusier-style complex remotefrom the city, does a fine job of preparing students for lifein the corporate state.   The host community, good-natured and historicallytolerant, barely raised an eyebrow recently when, on theanniversary of Kristallnacht, the leader of a Jewish studentorganization was found to have spraypainted anti-Semiticslogans on the door of the organization's office.</LP><TEXT>   I graduated in 1975 from another SUNY college that offereda mediocre education and, like SUNY Binghamton, has come tobe regarded as highly exclusive, although improvement in theproduct is not apparent to me. Could it be that studentsstruggle to get into SUNY Binghamton not because theinstitution excels, but because SUNY underprices its productand Binghamton has attracted more resources than other SUNYschools?   In the fields I follow -- political science, philosophy,economics -- SUNY is an arid wasteland and a haven for crankswho are proud to say they missed the '80s. You frequentlypick on the state university system in California, with whichSUNY is often compared, but California's state universitiesare home to a diversity of viewpoints and many scholars whoseinnovative thinking has affected mass culture. At SUNY,politically correct thinking is monolithic.   I say, let's cut off the money.   Jeffrey L. Mazur   Binghamton, N.Y.   ---   I would cry along with you about the terrible activitiesof the politically correct, but there is just one problem. Iremember that the history books I saw in school practicallynever mentioned the accomplishments of blacks and women.   Recalling what black people and other minorities enduredin trying to find their place in the human race in thiscountry, and remembering what the McCarthyites did to allegedMarxists in the 1950s, it's amazing that you can complainonly about the most recent group that comes on too strongabout righting supposed wrongs.   So politically correct is the current intolerance againsthatred. People are deemed racist, sexist or whateveraccording to their definitions. So what? It seems they've hadplenty of precedents on which to base their actions -- forcenturies it has been politically, racially and religiouslycorrect to hate one's neighbor.   Joan E. Harman   Coeur d'Alene, Idaho   ---   I'm writing to correct the blatant distortions in youreditorial. Readers are left with an inaccurate picture of theevent, the campus response and the plans currently in place.Your editorial writer spoke to three senior administrators atSUNY Binghamton -- the provost, the vice president forstudent affairs and me. We provided information regardingthis incident that is in no way reflected in your account. Iquestion why you failed to draw upon a broader range ofsources for a more balanced view of what took place,particularly since we have relied on a report from anexperienced public-safety investigator in attendance who didnot deem it necessary to intervene or call for assistance.   Yes, false reports were circulated regarding the purposeof the event. Yes, the room was overcrowded. Yes, it has beenalleged that a few faculty may have had a role in promotingopposition to the event. And yes, it has been alleged thatone student acted recklessly and offensively.   As was carefully explained to your writer, the universityhas mechanisms to deal with allegations of inappropriatebehavior. There was an immediate investigation by theDepartment of Public Safety. As a result, the campus judicialprocess is addressing the question of reckless and offensivestudent behavior. The Faculty Senate, through establishedprocedures, is addressing the faculty-conduct issues.   Our &quot;Rules and Expectations&quot; includes rules to &quot;meet thepractical requirements of an academic community whileproviding an environment in which all members of theuniversity community -- students, faculty, administrators,staff and other citizens -- may feel secure in theconstitutional and civil rights granted to them in thesociety at large.&quot; Consistent enforcement of these ruleswhile observing due process is the campus practice.   I believe it is a university's special responsibility toguarantee free exchange of ideas. We must protect the rightsof members of our community to express opinions, even thoseobjectionable to others. Freedom of inquiry will not becompromised.   Lois B. DeFleur   President   State University of New York at Binghamton   Binghamton, N.Y.</TEXT></DOC>
