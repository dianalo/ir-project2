Now they are wondering justhow deep Akzo's profit drop will be and whether the companywill cut its dividend.   Among European chemical shares, Akzo's were among the mostbattered in 1990 with a drop of 47% since the beginning oflast year, when the shares traded at 141.50 guilders($81.24). They closed yesterday at 75.20 guilders. Net incomeslumped 21% in the first nine months, and Amsterdam-RotterdamBank forecasts full-year net of 650 million guilders, down32% from 1989's record.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The expectation was that we would be much more resistantto a downturn,&quot; says Aarnout Loudon, Akzo's chairman.   Mr. Loudon, a former banker, won't comment on thedividend. To maintain it at 1989's eight guilders per share,the company would have to exceed its policy of paying out 35%to 40% of net. An Akzo spokesman says that policy is notabsolute and that the company will also consider its profitoutlook for 1991 when it makes the 1990 dividend decision inFebruary.   &quot;The general opinion is that they will maintain {thedividend at 1989's level}, but there is some doubt in themarket,&quot; says Victor Meijer, an analyst atAmsterdam-Rotterdam Bank.   In the late 1970s, Akzo nearly collapsed under the weightof losses from its manmade fibers business. Since then, thecompany has reduced fibers to about a fifth of its sales frommore than half. With a series of acquisitions, it has builtup its pharmaceutical, paint and specialty-chemicaloperations -- all areas that are supposed to be less cyclicalthan fibers or bulk chemicals.   Now Akzo is telling analysts it never promised them a rosegarden. Mr. Loudon says the company never denied that itremained in a lot of cyclical businesses, even though it hasimproved its product mix. &quot;With hindsight,&quot; however, heconcedes that Akzo was a little too optimistic about how wellit could perform in 1990.   He blames much of Akzo's stumble on &quot;bad luck&quot; and specialfactors:   -- In Brazil, where the company has about 5% of sales, thegovernment's austerity program throttled the economy and sentinterest rates soaring.   -- In Spain, where Akzo has much of its fibermanufacturing, cheaper imports flooded the market, knockingAkzo's unit into the red.   -- The tire industry, to which Akzo is a big supplier ofchemicals and fibers, sank into a deep slump.   -- The dollar's drop reduced the value of Akzo's U.S.earnings.   -- Sales of Akzo's fatty amines, used in detergentsofteners, plunged amid worries over environmental damage.   General economic conditions also hurt. Demand dropped forindustrial salt and other basic chemicals produced by Akzo.Slowdowns in construction and car manufacturing reduceddemand for paint and other coatings.   And Akzo created some of its own bad luck. Mr. Loudon saysmanagement at the former Stauffer specialty-chemicaloperations in the U.S., acquired by Akzo in 1987, was overlyambitious on research and investment projects.   In addition, Akzo expanded its U.S. production ofcatalysts used in oil and petrochemical refining, despite aprice war. Mr. Loudon says he still thinks that investmentwill pay off in the long run.   Only the pharmaceutical division -- whose biggest sellersare birth-control pills -- did well in 1990, producing a 15%rise in operating profit for the first nine months. Thatwasn't nearly enough to make up for the weakness elsewhere,even though Mr. Loudon imposed a cost-cutting drive lastspring.   Faced with this setback, some analysts are losingpatience. &quot;It's difficult to see where dynamic growth isgoing to come in Akzo,&quot; says Penny Tattersall of Barclays deZoete Wedd Research Ltd. in London. Ms. Tattersall arguesthat Akzo should concentrate on its best shots and be moreaggressive about pruning weaker units. &quot;They should decidewhat kind of company they're going to be,&quot; she says.   Mr. Loudon spurns such suggestions, arguing that Akzoalready is streamlining itself. In the past year, it hasannounced the sale of a 33% stake in Silenka B.V., a maker ofglass fiber, as well as plans to exit a joint venture thatmakes resins used in glues and to close a small plant thatmakes steel cord, used to reinforce tires.   Further fine-tuning is promised. For instance, Mr. Loudonsays Akzo is too small in engineering plastics and will shedthat unit or find a partner. But, he adds, &quot;you must notexpect dramatic effects.&quot; He says Akzo won't sell any of itsmajor businesses -- not even polyester fibers, a recurrentproblem area.   At Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank, Mr. Meijer worries thatcompetition from fiber makers in cheap-labor countries willonly intensify. Although Mr. Meijer doesn't think Akzo shouldjunk all of its mass-market fiber business, he says it shouldconcentrate on high-technology fibers.   Those include Akzo's Twaron brand aramid, an extremelystrong fiber used in making brake linings, bullet-proof vestsand other products. Twaron remains a distant No. 2 to thedominant Kevlar brand made by Du Pont Co., and Akzo is onlystarting to enter the U.S. market, having been barred fromthere for years by litigation between the two companies.   Mr. Loudon says that the Twaron business recently movedinto the black but that it is likely to slip into losses thisyear as the company invests in expanding capacity. He expectsthe unit to return to the black in 1992.   Mr. Loudon is coy about the often-raised question ofwhether Akzo might one day merge with the Netherlands' otherbig chemical maker, N.V. DSM, to form a company closer to thescale of Germany's chemical giants. On the one hand, he saysAkzo and DSM are &quot;very different&quot; and aren't discussing amerger.   On the other hand, he notes that such a merger would givethe two more financial clout in acquisition battles.</TEXT></DOC>
