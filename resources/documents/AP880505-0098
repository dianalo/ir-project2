President Corazon Aquino cited national security in barringMarcos, exiled in Hawaii, from attending the funeral of JosefaEdralin-Marcos, 95, who died Wednesday.   Mrs. Aquino today was asked about a statement by Marcos that hewould ``exhaust all possibilities'' to attend his mother's funeral.   ``I suppose we'll have to wait for him to exhaust all thosemeasures, but I stand firm on my decision not to allow him to comeback,'' Mrs. Aquino said.   Marcos spokesman Gemmo Trinidad, who read the Marcos statementto reporters in Hawaii, said the former president ``won't violateany laws to go back.''   The ban on Marcos also applies to his wife, Imelda, and histhree children.   Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, capital regional commander,ordered airport authorities to be on the alert after intelligencereports that Marcos' son, Ferdinand Jr., might slip back into thecountry for his grandmother's funeral.   Marcos fled the country with his wife and children after he wasousted by a popular uprising in February 1986.   Late Wednesday, hundreds of mourners, some shouting ``Marcos!Marcos!'' packed a Mass for Mrs. Edralin-Marcos after thegovernment refused her deathbed wish to let her son return.   Mrs. Edralin-Marcos was hospitalized Sunday suffering frompneumonia, diabetes and kidney failure.   Marcos supporters have been linked to several coup attemptsagainst Mrs. Aquino, whose husband, opposition leader BenignoAquino, was assassinated Aug. 21, 1983.   About 50 staff members and supporters joined Marcos and hiswife, Imelda, in their Makiki Heights home near Honolulu onWednesday for a Mass in memory of his mother.

The casualties included 16 soldiers and at least four rebels,although rebel casualty figures were incomplete.
