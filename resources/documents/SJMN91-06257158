Sheffield, 37, diedafter being hospitalized for pneumonia.;   Legionnaires' disease is believedto be caused by a bacterium that is found in soil and grows in water, such asair conditioning ducts, storage tanks and rivers. Pneumonia-like symptoms --including fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, head and muscle aches, chest painand blood-stained sputum -- develop two to 10 days after the infection.;   Itwas named from an outbreak at a Philadelphia hotel in July 1976 that resultedin 34 deaths, mostly members of the American Legion and their families. TheCenters for Disease Control estimates 25,000 people in the United States getthe disease each year.;   Before the cause of Sheffield's death was known,officials met all morning to decide whether to close the building, then sentthe employees home in the afternoon.;   &quot;This is ridiculous. They should havelet us go this morning,&quot; employee Pat Beck said.;   &quot;We've been worried withthe threat of sickness and frustrated with the bureaucracy,&quot; Beck said. &quot;It'shard for people to concentrate.&quot;;   In addition to the two people who remainhospitalized, Walker said, three are still out sick. The remaining six havereturned to work.;   &quot;We can't say to a certainty that we do not have aproblem,&quot; Linda McMahon, Social Security regional commissioner, said before itwas known Sheffield had Legionnaires' disease. &quot;We want to take someextraordinary measures for people's comfort levels.&quot;;   McMahon met withfederal and state health officials in the morning to decide whether to closethe building. Preliminary water tests came back clean, and health officialssaid they could find no reason to close the building, she said.;   &quot;This wasnot a health issue decision, it was an administrative and humane decision,&quot;McMahon said. &quot;We have worried employees.&quot;;   Workers were told Wednesdayabout the high number of co-workers becoming ill and were asked to fill out aquestionnaire about their own health in the past several months.;   Wise saidhealth officials were contacting the physicians of the sick employees toanalyze their health records and confirm whether each person actually hadpneumonia.;   Sheffield and three other sick employees worked in the basementof the building, and the eight others worked in different parts of thesix-story building, Walker said.;   Doctors looked for evidence ofLegionnaires' disease because symptoms of the sometimes-fatal diseasetypically include high fever and respiratory problems, as in pneumonia.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Richmond  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910913  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  542  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, September 13, 199100257158,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
