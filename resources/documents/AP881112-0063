Although some research suggests that justliving near a plant may increase the risk of leukemia fromradiation, other scientific studies indicate that such small dosesof low-level radiation pose small risk.   Concern over nuclear contamination has been growing as the EnergyDepartment discloses more and more problems at the nuclear weaponsproduction plants that it runs in 13 states. The department has saidit will cost up to $110 billion to clean up environmentalcontamination at 17 major plants.   Those plants ``constitute a public health emergency,'' said Dr.H. Jack Geiger, a medical professor in New York and spokesman forthe anti-nuclear group, Physicians for Social Responsibility.   Geiger, calling the weapons complex a ``creeping Chernobyl,'' isurging the federal government to commission extensive studies of theeffect of radiation from the plants on surrounding populations.   In fact, the federal government has spent about $2 billionsponsoring dozens of studies on nuclear workers and neighbors, buthas come up without a clear picture of the health risks.   Research is hampered by shifts in population near nuclear plantsand problems measuring exactly how much radiation people are exposedto. Moreover, the rate of excess cancer is hard to determine againsta national population in which, according to the American CancerSociety, an estimated one out of three Americans will eventuallyhave cancer.   ``The whole situation is rather puzzling,'' said Seymour Jablon,an expert at the National Cancer Institute in the Washington suburbof Bethesda. ``The only thing that is really sticking its head up isleukemia,'' especially among children.   To gain a clearer picture of the risks, the cancer institute isharnessing a mainframe computer to study health, mortality andmorbidity data from 127 U.S. counties which host or are next tonuclear power plants or weapons processing facilities. The resultswill be compared with rates from 400 other counties not nearreactors.   The project began last January and results are expected by theend of next summer, said Jablon.   Several studies of populations near British reactors have showedhigher than average rates of leukemia and other types of cancers,and some studies of workers at the Savannah River Plant, in Aiken,S.C., and at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, in Richland, Wash.,show higher than average rates for some types of cancers.   Another study of children in Utah exposed to fallout from atomictests in Nevada 1951 to 1958 showed a higher rate of leukemia.   But the results of those studies have been disputed by otherresearchers, and some scientists say they do not present a generalpattern that would prove nuclear plants pose a threat.   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,which has been scathingly critical of the Energy Department's safetyand environmental practices, reviewed many of those studies andconcluded in a two-volume report in 1981 that ``there is as yet noway to determine precisely the cancer risks of low-level ionizingradiation and it is unlikely that this question will be resolvedsoon.''   For workers at nuclear plants, generally exposed to higher levelsof radiation than nearby residents, ``the most general statement wecan say is that overall mortality is similar to or better than thegeneral population,'' said Dr. Shirley A. Fry, head of epidemiologicresearch at Oak Ridge Associated Universities, in Oak Ridge, Tenn.,which is conducting research under contract for the EnergyDepartment.   ``We have seen in several populations an elevation of one type ofcancer or another, but there is no pattern,'' she said.   Scientists may have trouble measuring exposure rates amongnuclear neighbors, but the government now admits some cases ofextensive radiation release.   One of the grimmest was the release in December 1949 of massiveamounts of radioactive iodine 131 from the Hanford plant.   The so-called ``green run'' apparently was intended to help U.S.intelligence officials develop means of tracking suspected radiationleaks from the Soviet nuclear weapons program.   June Stark Casey, a sophomore at Whitman College in Walla Walla,Wash., in 1949, said that after the release she became weak andbegan to lose hair.   ``My parents spent thousands of dollars taking me from doctor todoctor. Although these are common effects of overexposure toradiation, the cause didn't occur to my parents because the releaseswere kept secret,'' Casey was quoted as saying in the Bulletin ofAtomic Scientists.   The links between cancer and high levels of radiation are betterdocumented, most convincingly in studies of 50,000 survivors of theatomic bomb attacks on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   Among those exposed to massive doses of radiation from the bombs,researchers found 480 excess cancers, including about 100 leukemias,followed by cancers of the lung, stomach, colon, female breast andthyroid, said Jablon of the National Cancer Institute.   The lack of persuasive scientific data has not persuaded criticsthat no link exists between low-level radiation doses and cancer.   ``They don't have good data. The means they have to measuredisease are too crude, and what they are looking for is subtle. Butthat doesn't mean that we don't have problems,'' said Frances CloseHart, chairwoman of the Environmental Research Foundation, anenvironmental group in Columbia, S.C., and an active critic of theSavannah River Plant, in Aiken.</TEXT></DOC>
