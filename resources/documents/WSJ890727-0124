The new projection is up from a March forecast of a 20.7% rise in 1989 capital outlays. Last year, capital spending by manufacturers increased 14.9%.    The latest spending estimates show that Canadian business is &quot;responding to the realities of the free-trade agreement,&quot; said Mike McCracken, president of Informetrica Ltd., an economic-consulting firm.    The trade pact, which took effect Jan. 1, provides for gradual elimination of most trade barriers between the U.S. and Canada, including a phase-out of all tariffs by January 1998.    Roger Hamel, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said the prospect of the free-trade agreement was a &quot;significant&quot; factor in business planning for this year's capital spending.    Among manufacturers, producers of paper products, primary metals and chemicals are expected to show the biggest increase in 1989 outlays.    Other business sectors, except for the mining industry, also intend to increase capital outlays this year. Capital spending by the mining sector is expected to drop 11.6%, mainly because of an anticipated 15.1% drop in outlays by the oil industry.    Economists said Canadian capital outlays would have risen this year even without the free-trade agreement, but probably not as strongly. Some industries have been operating at close to capacity; these include primary metals, electrical and electronic products, primary textiles, and chemicals. Manufacturers generally have been operating at about 84% of capacity.    Another factor cited in the big planned increase in capital spending was the desire of business to take advantage of the tax system's accelerated write-off rates for manufacturing investments. These rates are to be reduced further in 1990 and 1991.    Capital-spending intentions have strengthened, despite Canada's high interest rates. Prime lending rates of Canadian banks have been at 13.5% since March, the highest level in five years.    Manufacturing, however, has held up fairly well. New orders rose 2% in May, partly offsetting a 4.6% decline in April, Statistics Canada said. Shipments rose 0.5% in May. The ratio of inventories to shipments was 1.55 to 1 in May, unchanged from April and up slightly from 1.54 to 1 a year earlier.    John Clinkard, senior economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said he doesn't expect any further capital-spending growth next year, because of what he predicts will be an erosion of corporate profits and a decline in capacity-utilization rates as the economy softens.    Capital spending by manufacturers is expected to rise to 22.53 billion Canadian dollars (US$18.97 billion) this year from C$17.62 billion last year, Statistics Canada said. </TEXT></DOC>
