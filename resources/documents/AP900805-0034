Horst Ehmke, deputy chairman of the West German SocialDemocrats, reportedly suggested the East German Social Democratsmay propose instant unity during a special parliamentary sessionthis week.   Asked by the newspaper Bild whether the East German SocialDemocrats might make such a move during the Wednesday session inEast Berlin, Ehmke reportedly replied: ``I don't know. I don'texclude it.''   The Social Democratic parties in both Germanys are in closeconsultation with one another.   The East German Social Democrats are part of Prime MinisterLothar de Maiziere's broad coalition government. The West GermanSocial Democrats are the main opposition to Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   On Saturday, the head of the West German Social Democrats,Hans-Jochen Vogel, said West Germany would have to ``respect'' adecision by East Germany's Parliament for an ``early joining'' tothe west before all-German elections.   Other West German Social Democrats have echoed that view in thepast two days. The move is most likely an effort to improve theparty's chances of winning the leadership of a united Germany whenall-German elections take place.   The Social Democrats' apparent maneuvering comes as Kohl pressesto have all-German elections moved up from Dec. 2 to Oct. 14. Underthat scheme, formal unity would occur immediately before the vote.   Kohl's Christian Democrats want all-German elections to takeplace quickly to avoid a potential loss of voter support if theEast German economy collapses.   Joblessness in East Germany has climbed to more than 240,000after the July 2 economic merger of the two Germanys and isexpected to move much higher.   Social Democrats are fighting to keep the elections from beingmoved up to Oct. 14.   But the Social Democrats now say they would accept actualunification much sooner because of East Germany's economic problems.   That would allow them to be perceived as embracing a processthey have tried to slow, while still pushing for elections inDecember, when the economic woes are expected to be much worse.   Whether all-German elections occur on Dec. 2 or Oct. 14 hingeson Kohl's ability to persuade the West German Parliament to make aconstitutional change necessary for the earlier date.   For that, Kohl needs a two-thirds majority vote he can't managewithout the Social Democrats.   Oskar Lafontaine, Kohl's Social Democratic rival for thechancellorship of a united Germany has vowed to block Kohl's plan.   Kohl himself seemed to acknowledge that pushing the idea throughWest Germany's Parliament will be harder than expected.   ``Kohl's panicky proposal clearly shows that he sees his chancesvanishing every day,'' Lafontaine told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung ina report released to other news media in advance of Monday'spublication.   Seiters also announced that Kohl and Hans-Jochen Vogel, federalleader of the Social Democrats, would meet on Tuesday to try toreach agreement on the elections.   The proposal to move up the all-German vote to Oct. 14 was madepublic Friday by de Maiziere, following consultations with Kohl.</TEXT></DOC>
