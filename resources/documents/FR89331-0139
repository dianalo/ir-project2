Statutory Standards </ITAG>Section 17A of the Act requires a clearing agency, as defined in section3(a)(23) of the Act and subject to certain exceptions, to register withthe Commission.\12\<NOTE/> PTC, a depository for mortgage-backed securities, falls withinthe section 3(a)(23) definition of a clearing agency and therefore is requiredto register with the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ The term ``clearing agency'' is defined, in pertinentpart, as any person, such as a securities depository, who (1) acts as acustodian of securities in connection with a system for the central handlingof securities whereby all securities of a particular class or series ofany issuer deposited within the system are treated as fungible and maybe transferred, loaned, or pledged by bookkeeping entry without physicaldelivery of securities certificates, or (2) otherwise permits or facilitatesthe settlement of securities transactions or the hypothecation or lendingof securities without physical delivery of securities certificates. <T3>See</T3> 15 U.S.C. 78c(23) (1988).  Subparagraphs (A) through (I) of section 17A(b)(3) of the Act \13\<NOTE/> set forth specific determinations the Commission must makein granting registration. The Commission has published clearing agencyregistration standards (``Standards'') that provide additional guidelinesconcerning the Division of Market Regulation's (``Division'') interpretationof subparagraphs (A) through (I).\14\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16900 (June 17, 1980),45 FR 41920. The Commission notes that the Standards were developed inthe context of registration of ten clearing agencies engaged primarilyin clearing domestic corporate debt and equity securities and to a lesserextent, municipal securities. The Commission recognizes that some of theStandards may not be appropriate for clearing agencies that provide servicesfor other investment products such as mortgage-backed securities. Accordingly,the Commission intends to apply the Division Standards flexibly and ona case-by-case basis. In addition, the Standards allow clearing agenciesto submit reasons why a particular Standard may be inappropriate and tosuggest alternatives that are consistent with the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion </ITAG>A. Scope of the Order This Order concerns the temporary registration of PTC as a clearing agencyunder section 17A of the Act for a period not to exceed 12 months. Thedeterminations made in this Order reflect a review of PTC's applicationfor registration, including its by-laws, rules and procedures and all otheraspects of its operations contained in the application. The determinationsalso reflect the Commission's experience during the past two years withthe operation of MBSCC's Depository Division, which PTC has purchased,and discussions among Commission staff, GNMA and MBSCC officials, PDA representatives,federal bank regulators, bankers and dealers. The Commission believes it is appropriate to grant PTC registration fora period of 12 months. Although PTC will have a fully operable depositoryfrom the start, because of the recent revisions to MBSCC's rules in anticipationof a buyout many aspects of PTC's operations [<T3>e.g., </T3>PTC's net debit monitoring levels, repurchase agreement(``repo'') accounting procedures and collateral loan facility] will benew, if not novel, in a high volume environment. Indeed, although PTC hasdevoted considerable attention to training its staff and its participantsto handle trade processing at foreseeable peak processing volumes, indirectusers of PTC services including issuers, warehouse lenders, dealers andinvestors may be less familiar with PTC's operations and may require extensivetraining during the next few months. PTC plans to review its proceduresto eliminate any inconsistencies between PTC's rules and its operatingprocedures.\15\<NOTE/> Furthermore, PTC will make a number of operational and proceduralchanges.\16\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ The Commission recognizes that the formation of PTC andthe revision of MBSCC's Depository Division rules in recent months raisesthe potential for apparent inconsistencies between PTC's rules as filedand the participant operating procedures distributed and used by the MBSCCDepository Division during the last two years. PTC's rules, as currentlyfiled, to the extent they apparently conflict with those procedures andto the extent not noted otherwise in this Order, govern and supersede thoseprocedures. PTC expects to review all of its procedures in the next fewmonths to assure consistency with its rules and to incorporate any recentoperational enhancements to PTC systems. (<T3>See</T3> letter from Lois J. Radisch, Esq., Milbank, Tweed, Hadleyandamp; McCloy, to Jonathan Kallman, Assistant Director, Division, Commission,dated February 24, 1989.) Revisions to those procedures would be rulesof a clearing agency under section 3(a)(27) of the Act and as such mustbe filed for review under section 19(b) of the Act. To facilitate Commission,participant and public review of those procedures, the Commission encouragesPTC to file its procedures on a system-by-system basis as PTC conductsits review. PTC also must modify its principal and interest collectionand payment procedures to allow for voluntary instead of mandatory advancesof principal and interest. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25800 (June 13, 1988),53 FR 23162. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ <T3>See</T3> letter from Lois J.

Briefly, those changes include: <ITAG tagnum="28">(1) Eliminating trade reversals from the procedures to cover a participantdefault; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(2) Phasing out the aggregate excess net debit limitation for extensionsunder the net debit monitoring level procedures; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(3) Making principal and interest advances, now mandatory, optional;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(4) Allowing participants to retrieve securities in the abeyance accountand not allowing participants to reverse a transfer because its customermay not be able to fulfill its financial obligations to the participant;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(5) Eliminating the deliverer's security interest and replacing itwith a substitute; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(6) Reexamining the account structures rules to make them consistentwith the new lien procedure. (See notes 42, 43 and 48 and discussion followingnote 23, </ITAG><T3>infra.</T3>)The Commission expects to review its determinations within 12 months toconsider whether to grant PTC full registration as a clearing agency. Duringthis time, the Commission will monitor and oversee PTC operations throughvarious regulatory methods, including review of Rule l9b-4 submissions,\1\\7\<NOTE/> notices to members\1\\8\<NOTE/> and disciplinary filings.\1\\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ Rule 19b-4 requires proposed rule changes by a self-regulatoryorganization (``SRO'') (including clearing agencies) to be filed with theCommission for approval pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28">Rules of a clearing agency include, among other things, its articlesof incorporation, by-laws, rules and such of the stated policies, practicesand interpretations (``SPPI'') of such clearing agency as the Commission,by rule, may determine necessary to be deemed rules of such clearing agency.</ITAG><T3>See </T3>section 3(a)(27) of the Act. Rule 19b-4 defines an SPPI as:(1) Any material aspect of the operation of the facilities of the SRO;or (2) any statement made generally available to the membership of, toall participants in, or to persons having or seeking access (``specifiedperson'') to facilities of an SRO that establishes or changes any standard,limit, or guideline, with respect to: (i) The rights, obligations, or privilegesof specified persons; or (ii) the meaning, administration or enforcementof an existing rule. <ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission has deemed certain SPPIs to be rules of a clearingagency. Generally, a clearing agency SPPI is deemed to be a proposed rulechange unless it meets one of two exclusions: (1) It is reasonably andfairly implied by an existing SRO rule; or (2) it is concerned solely withthe administration of the SRO and is not an SPPI with respect to the administration,meaning, or enforcement of an existing SRO rule. As explained in SecuritiesExchange Act Release No. 17258 (November 7, 1980), 45 FR 73906, neitherof the two exclusions were intended to cover SPPIs that affect the mannerin which members or others do business or in which the system functions,in a way that is not reasonably foreseeable from the rule to which theSPPI applies. </ITAG><T3>See </T3>45 FR 73906, 73913 at note 76. Procedures, processing timeframes,forms, and requirements for record layouts regarding operational aspectsof clearing agency services that are widely distributed to clearing agencymembers and that establish industry practice, impose significant coststo clearing agency members, or change current industry practice would beconsidered proposed rule changes under Rule 19b-4 under the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ Rule 17a-22 requires a registered clearing agency tofile with the Commission within ten days of release, three copies of anymaterial including manuals, notices, circulars, bulletins, lists or periodicalsissued or made generally available to its participants or to other entitieswith whom it has a significant relationship. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ <T3>See </T3>section 19(d) of the Act.B. Capacity To Promote the Promptand Accurate Clearance and Settlement of Securities Section 17A(b)(3)(A) of the Act requires that a clearing agency be organizedand that its rules be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearanceand settlement of securities transactions for which it is responsible.As discussed below, the Commission believes that PTC meets the requirementsof section 17A(b)(3)(A) of the Act. The need for a centralized depository facility for certificated mortgage-backedsecurities is without question. GNMA pass-through securities remain oneof the few certificated investment securities that are processed in a decentralized,physical delivery environment, in spite of substantial trading volume inactive cash, forward and repurchase agreement markets. The formation of PTC is another important step in the effort to immobilizecertificates during the trade settlement process. PTC is a necessary complementto MBSCC's Clearing Division in achieving the goal of prompt and accurateclearance and settlement of mortgage-backed securities transactions. Absenta mortgage-backed securities depository, the benefits of centralized clearanceand settlement and netting cannot be  fully realized. Although nettingof trades by MBSCC's Clearing Division reduces the number of settlementsamong dealers, without a mortgage-backed securities depository, settlementof net inter dealer trades and all customer transactions still must bemade by physical delivery of certificates. PTC will provide long-term benefitsto the industry in a number of areas, including certificate custody, secondarymarket trading and primary distributions.\20\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ Section 17A(e) directs the Commission to use its authorityunder the Act to end the physical movement of securities certificates inconnection with settlements among brokers and dealers of transactions insecurities. The Commission believes registration of PTC will further thatstatutory objective. PTC's user-shareholders have invested a substantial amount of funds tosupport the infrastructure necessary for market operations. Development,hardware, software and personnel costs are likely to exceed $15 millionduring the next three to five years. Thus, it is possible that initialcosts to establish and maintain PTC's operations may exceed the benefitsPTC's participants (particularly those participants who purchase stockin PTC) realize during those initial years. Nevertheless, experience inother markets has shown that an initial investment can yield geometricallygreater benefits in the long-term. For example, the Commission notes thatthe cost of executing a trade in corporate securities today is significantlyless than the cost of such a trade before 1975, because securities andbanking industries have made  substantial investments in centralized depositoryand clearing facilities (<T3>e.g.,</T3> the Depository Trust Company, the National Securities ClearingCorporation, the Midwest Securities Clearing Corporation, the Midwest SecuritiesTrust Company, the Options Clearing Corporation, the Philadelphia DepositoryTrust Company and the Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia). Physical delivery of certificates, with frequent multiple movements onthe streets on settlement day, presents a high risk of certificate lossor theft. ln I986, the year prior to MBSCC's registration as a clearingagency, GNMA certificates with an approximate value of $60 million werereported either lost or stolen. Immobilization of certificates should reducethe risk of loss significantly. A further benefit to deposit of securities into PTC is its ability to collectand disburse principal and interest (``Pandamp;I'') payments. GNMA Pandamp;Ipayments frequently are delayed and in many cases misdirected. This isdue in part to the way Pandamp;I payments on GNMA I securities are processed.\21\<NOTE/> Because PTC will centralize holdings of GNMA securities andwill devote substantial resources to collecting Pandamp;I on a timely basis,PTC participants and their customers can expect a steadier and more timelyflow of Pandamp;I payments.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ There are two types of GNMA securities. GNMA I securities,which were first issued in 1970, have a central transfer agent but no centralpaying agent. Each issuer of GNMA I securities makes Pandamp;I payments directlyto the owners of each issue. GNMA II securities, which were first introducedin 1983, takes advantage of technological improvements made since 1970,thus allowing GNMA II securities issuers to make consolidated paymentsto owners through a centralized paying agent. GNMA I securities representmost of the GNMA market and most of the Pandamp;I payment problems. <T3>See Progress and Prospects: Depository Immobilization of Securitiesand Use of Book-Entry Systems. </T3>Draft Staff Report (June 14, 1985),which discussed the problem of delayed or misdirected Pandamp;I payments.The report indicates that the bulk of misdirected Pandamp;I payments involveGNMA I securities. The absence of a centralized payment system for GNMAI securities results in the use of considerable resources to research andclaim erroneous Pandamp;I payments.   All securities deposited by participants and limited purpose participantswill be registered in the name of PTC's nominee, MBSCC andamp; Company. PTCwill collect the Pandamp;I payment from the paying agents, and credit theappropriate participants' and limited purpose participants' accounts onPTC's distribution date (generally, the 16th day each month).\22\<NOTE/> In the event issuers or paying agents do not make timelypayments to PTC, PTC will advance Pandamp;I payments to participants, usingits own funds, the cash portion of participants' mandatory deposits intothe participants fund or borrowed funds. If a Pandamp;I payment is more thanfive days overdue, PTC will contact the paying agent. If the paying agentwill not pay, PTC will seek payment from GNMA under its guarantee. To date,MBSCC has not been required to seek payment from GNMA because of a payingagent's failure to make Pandamp;I payments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ Payable date is the date on which issuers and payingagents are required to make Pandamp;I payments to PTC, generally the 15thof the month. Distribution date is the next business day after payabledate and is the day PTC distributes Pandamp;I payments to its participants.Financing for Pandamp;I advances will be secured by PTC's right, as recordowner of the subject securities, to receive Pandamp;I payments, GNMA's guaranteeof those payments, and PTC's right under its agreement with participantsto collect PTC's financing costs and to reverse Pandamp;I credits to theextent those payments are not otherwise collectible by PTC. As a generalmatter, PTC will charge participants for any costs PTC incurs in usingits credit facilities to meet Pandamp;I distributions. Thus, although participantsgain certainty in Pandamp;I payment collections, they may do so at a price.In response to objections from Bear Stearns and at the Commission's request,MBSCC agreed to give participants an option not to receive Pandamp;I creditsuntil MBSCC receives funds from the paying agent, thereby permitting electingparticipants to forego PTC's financing costs.\2\\3\<NOTE/> Because of the need for programming and operational changes,MBSCC agreed to develop such an option by July 1989. In this regard, PTChas represented that it will honor MBSCC's commitment.\2\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25800 (June 23, 1988),53 FR 23162 (``Pandamp;I Order''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ <T3>See </T3>note 16, <T3>supra. </T3>MBSCC Depository Division experience collecting Pandamp;I payments over thelast two years shows substantial improvement in timely Pandamp;I paymentsand correspondingly lower financing  costs for Pandamp;I advances. As a resultof improved industry practices and a continuing program at MBSCC to improvePandamp;I payment receipts, timely payments of Pandamp;I to MBSCC over thesix month period from August 1988 through January 1989 averaged 83% ofthe value of Pandamp;I payments to participants on distribution date. Thiscompares favorably with 1987 when only 63% of the value of Pandamp;I paymentswere received by payable date. PTC's facilities are likely to enhance secondary market trading of mortgage-backedsecurities by increasing efficiency, safety, reducing costs and, at thesame time, allowing increased trading volume. Settlement of trades throughPTC's book-entry system can be instantaneous and turnaround deliveriescan be handled without delay. In addition, PTC's collateral loan facilityprovides a centralized loan facility which will give participants quickeraccess to funds to cover anticipated debit balances. PTC's capacity to track repo positions also will allow continued growthand increased safety in that segment of the market. The ability to recordownership interests in particular pools of mortgage-backed securities andto track those interests even though the securities may have been delivered(and redelivered) in a chain of repo and reverse-repo transactions willbring greater certainty to repo participants. The Commission believes thatthis facility is long overdue.\2\\5\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>SEC, Request for Comments on the Oversight of the U.S.Government and Agency Securities Markets, Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 21959 (April 19, 1985), 50 FR I5905. PTC expects to facilitate the delivery of newly-issued GNMA securities,among other things, by centralizing deliveries, including delivery forpledge financing, among issuers, warehouse lenders, dealers and custodiansfor institutional and other investors through limited purpose participantaccounts. Issuers who meet PTC's financial and operational criteria forlimited purpose participants\2\\6\<NOTE/> will be eligible to participate in PTC for certain services,including transfer of securities out of their accounts (free or for value)to another participant, and pledge of securities to a warehouse lenderby book-entry movement. To guard against the risk of financial loss, however,issuers who use PTC services as limited purpose participants will not beeligible to receive securities against payment. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ <T3>See </T3>discussion following note 59, <T3>infra.</T3> The Commission believes that providing a facility to centralize the distributionof newly-issued GNMA securities will increase the efficiency of the mortgage-backedsecurities market. A centralized distribution system will decrease costsassociated with an initial distribution including personnel, transfer agentcommunication, distribution procedures and other associated costs. In addition,the securities will be on deposit at PTC from the start, eliminating extramovement of certificates, thereby decreasing costs. Finally, the limited purpose participant category will allow warehouse lenders, issuers andothers to process loans in a safe and efficient manner. C. Capacity to Safeguard Funds and Securities As discussed below in detail, the Commission believes that PTC has thecapacity to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control orfor which it is responsible, as required by section I7A(b)(3)(A) of theAct. The Commission bases that determination on its review of PTC's rules,procedures, and facilities management arrangements. Specifically, the Commissionhas reviewed the facilities management arrangements, the physical securityprocedures surrounding PTC's certificate custody functions, PTC's internalaccounting controls related to recordkeeping and PTC's financial risk managementrules.\2\\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ The Commission notes that PTC's appropriate regulatoryagency, at such time as PTC becomes a member of the Federal Reserve System,will be the Fed. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(42). <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Facilities Management </ITAG>Unlike its predecessor, PTC will perform most of its own services and operationsin-house at its data center located at 40 Rector Street, New York, NewYork. PTC has its own dedicated computer hardware and software and approximately75 employees to perform PTC services.\2\\8\<NOTE/> Among other things, PTC  will perform its own data processing,credit administration and account maintenance. PTC plans to operate itsown wire room to handle payment and collection for the settlement of participantaccounts_<T3>i.e., </T3>PTC plans to effect money settlement directly with its participantson a daily basis through PTC's Fedwire account at the NY Fed. PTC has agreementswith outside entities to provide any services that PTC does not have in-house.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ The 40 Rector Street office computer hardware and softwareand personnel come to PTC as part of the MBSCC Depository Division buyout.Prior to performing operations in-house, MBSCC had a facilities managementagreement with Chemical Bank, which performed Depository Division servicesat MBSCC's direction. PTC will succeed to MBSCC's custodial agreement with Chemical Bank wherebyChemical Bank will provide comprehensive services for certificate processingand safekeeping. On PTC's behalf, Chemical Bank will: (1) Accept securitiesdeposits by PTC participants or limited purpose participants; (2) segregateall securities from all other physical securities maintained by ChemicalBank, and (3) hold, release or otherwise dispose of securities pursuantto PTC's instructions. Chemical Bank, as a national bank and member ofthe Fed, is regulated and examined by the Office of the Comptroller ofthe Currency (``Comptroller'') and the Fed. Chemical Bank stores all securitiesheld for PTC in a segregated area of time-locked vaults monitored by closedcircuit television and armed guards. Chemical Bank also maintains severalalarm systems and has procedures to monitor and control employee accessto the vault. Chemical Bank's procedures for safeguarding PTC-related securitiesand funds will be audited by Chemical Bank's internal and external auditorsand by PTC's auditors.Chemical Bank is the contractor to GNMA to perform transfer agent functionsfor both GNMA I and II securities. Chemical Bank will receive securitiesdeposits for PTC accounts and Will register those securities in PTC's nomineename. ln addition, Chemical Bank will issue and deposit into PTC new GNMAcertificates in PTC's nominee name for limited purpose participant issuers.Chemical Bank also will process securities withdrawal requests, registercertificates according to participant instructions and make those certificatesavailable for pick-up by participants. In each case, Chemical Bank's roleas custodian and transfer agent will eliminate physical shipment to multiplethird-party transfer agents. Under the custodian agreement between ChemicalBank and PTC, Chemical Bank is required to maintain Banker's Blanket BondInsurance that includes mortgage-backed securities and covers breach offidelity, theft, loss on premises and in transit, and forgery. ChemicalBank currently maintains insurance coverage in the amount of $100,000,000.Irrespective of insurance coverage, Chemical Bank is required to replaceany securities in its custody that are lost, stolen, or misappropriated.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Recordkeeping and Data Processing </ITAG>The Commission believes that systemic and other controls surrounding thePTC recordkeeping and data processing functions satisfy the requirementsof the Act. In addition, the Commission believes that PTC's recordkeepingand data processing systems have the capacity to facilitate the promptand accurate clearance and settlement of securities. Participants will use on-line computer terminals, linked to PTC by dedicatedlines to communicate instructions to PTC and from which they can receivereal-time information on their net settlement positions and collateralizationrequirements. At the end of every business day, PTC will provide participantswith reports, including transaction and position reports. Under PTC rules,participants must review daily reports and report any errors or discrepanciesto facilitate daily reconciliation with PTC. PTC's computer system is designed to prevent unauthorized access, amongother things, by using a dual-level security password system. The systemedits for invalid entry codes and other invalid data in an on-line environment.Each participant and limited purpose participant has access to PTC througha separate leased line. PTC's computer equipment has been configured to assure back-up capabilityin all critical areas. PTC's hardware includes 4 DEC 8700 mainframe computers,13 DEC Micro Vax ll minicomputers and 23 gigabytes of disk storage. Thisprovides PTC 100% redundancy for any or all failing hardware componentsat its 40 Rector Street office. \29\<NOTE/> All production files on  disk, both applications and programs,will be backed up each night and shipped for offsite storage. In addition,a back-up copy of application files and one previous version of programswill be retained for one week at the 40 Rector Street office. The back-upcopy will be used to restore data or programs in the event of disk failure.For communications backup, all modems and participants' sites will be configuredwith dial-up back-up support for protection against leased-line outages.In addition, PTC can support up to 24 lines on dial-up back-up at the sametime. \30\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ PTC intends to implement a plan developed by the MBSCCDepository Division to create a New Jersey data center and to revise theparticipant's network. PTC will have two live, active data centers at twoseparate locations with a participants' network that can switch from siteto site. This would provide PTC an instant contingency site in the eventthat the other site suffered a complete failure. PTC will begin the constructionprocess once the buyout is completed. Construction is expected to take3-6 months. PTC has committed $237,000 of its initial capitalization of$15 million toward construction and development of the backup site. Seeletter from Lois J. Radisch, Esq., Milbank, Tweed, Hadley andamp; McCloy,to Ester Saverson, Jr., Branch Chief, Division, Commission, dated February22, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ In 1988, MBSCC's processing and file updating functionsexperienced less than 1% downtime. The longest period of continuous downtimewas 90 minutes and was due to an error within a new release of software.A stress test of the system conducted in August 1987 indicated that thesystem is capable of processing 50,000 transactions per day and 16,000transactions in just over a one hour period. Current volume averages between2,000 and 3,000 transactions per day with a peak of 10,000 transactions.PTC projects these figures to increase to 8,700 and 42,000, respectively,in 1989. PTC plans upgrades to its hardware in I989 that will double processingcapacity. See letter from Charles F. Martin, President, MBSCC, to JosephMcDonald, Attorney, Division, Commission, dated February 17, 1989.PTC's internal audit program reviews the adequacy of its systems and controls.The audit committee of PTC's Board of Directors, composed of non-managementdirectors, oversees that program as implemented by internal auditors, selectsPTC's independent public accountant, and reviews the system of internalaccounting controls with both internal auditors and PTC's independent publicaccountant. Under PTC's rules, the independent public accountant performsannually an evaluation of PTC internal accounting controls and PTC mustmake the independent public accountant's opinion and report available toall participants and limited purpose participants. The New York State BankingDepartment and the NY Fed will examine PTC periodically. In addition, ChemicalBank undergoes internal and external audits and is subject to periodicexaminations by the Fed and Comptroller. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Financial Risk Manaqement </ITAG>The Commission has determined that PTC has the capacity to safeguard fundsand securities in a manner consistent with the Act. The principal financialrisk to PTC and its participants is the failure of a participant to payits net cash debit balance. As discussed below, PTC safeguards againstsuch risks include membership applicant standards and continuing financialqualifications for participants, \31\<NOTE/> a participants fund, full collateralization of delivery-generatedpayment obligations, net debit caps (i.e.. an individually-tailored limiton the amount each participant can owe PTC at any time during the day),specific procedures to manage  participant defaults and insolvencies, includingcommitted lines of credit to allow PTC to meet its immediate settlementobligations if a participant defaults, and rules allocating losses in theevent any occur. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ See discussion following note 59, infra. a. <T3>Participants. Depository Accounts and Participants Fund. </T3>PTC hastwo categories of participants: (1) Participants that have access to thefull range of PTC services (<T3>e.g., </T3>broker-dealers and banks), and (2) limited purpose participantswhose access, capital requirements and participants fund contributionsare limited because they cannot receive securities for payment. Limitedpurpose participants include issuers who take delivery of GNMA securitiesoriginally issued through PTC and warehouse lenders who advance funds toprospective issuers secured by the mortgages that underlie such GNMA securities.A participant may maintain one or more depository accounts, which are calledmaster accounts.\32\<NOTE/> Each master account contains three types of sub-accounts:(1) A proprietary account, for a participant acting as principal; (2) anagency account, for a participant acting as an agent for third  parties;and (3) a pledgee account, for a participant acting in a lending capacity.Each proprietary, agency and pledgee account has an associated transferaccount, in which securities transferred versus payment are kept intraday.\33\<NOTE/> Each proprietary and agency account also has an associatedsegregation (``seg'') account into which fully-paid-for securities maybe transferred for segregation purposes. Securities in seg accounts arenot subject to PTC's lien and the value of those securities are not includedin the computation of net free equity. Because securities held in the pledgeeaccount do not expose PTC to risk, PTC does not hold a lien on those securitiesnor does it include them in the computation of net free equity.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ A separate contribution to the participants fund, computationof net free equity and determination of account transfers is maintainedfor each master account of a participant. A participant may transfer bothsecurities and funds between master accounts. In order to effectively monitora participant's aggregate net debit, however, a participant's net debitmonitoring level will be calculated from the aggregate of the securitiesand funds held in its master account.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ All securities transfers subject to money payment aretransferred first to the receiving participant's appropriate transfer account.Those transfers are deemed to be transfers to PTC and not to the receivingparticipant, and PTC holds title to those securities for the purpose ofsecuring participant obligations to PTC. In addition, the securities aresubject to a security interest held by the delivering participant. Thereceiving participant may not redeliver securities in the transfer accountor withdraw securities from that account intraday unless that participant``prefunds,'' or makes an optional deposit of cash into its participantsfund equal to or greater than the contract value of the securities. Atthe end of each business day, PTC transfers securities in the transferaccount to the receiving participant's associated depository account onlyafter the receiving participant has paid its cash settlement obligationfor that account. Limited purpose participants may not receive securitiesversus payment and, therefore, may not incur debit balances as a resultof account transfers. Accordingly, PTC does not impose a lien on securitiesin limited purpose accounts and does not compute net free equity with respectto those accounts. PTC maintains a participants fund, composed of minimum cash deposits andPTC-approved government securities \34\<NOTE/> to cover losses due to participant default or insolvency.Each participant (other than a limited purpose participant) must make amandatory deposit ranging from $1,000,000 to $10,000,000 based on a prescribedpercentage of the prior month's average monthly gross debits on settlementdays announced by the PSA \35\<NOTE/> or other days which PTC determines are appropriate. A participantmust deposit a minimum of $150,000 in cash while the remaining depositmay be in cash or securities. Limited purpose participants have a mandatoryparticipants fund deposit of $50,000 in cash. Participants may make additionalcontributions to the participants fund to collateralize transactions andadditional cash contributions (prefunding) to allow intra-day withdrawalsor free transfers of securities which are the subject of a transactionthat day.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ PTC-approved government securities include U.S. TreasuryNotes, Bills, Bonds and FHLMC and FNMA securities, regardless of maturity.FHLMC and FNMA securities currently are ineligible for deposit at PTC,but accordingly can be deposited with PTC as collateral for participantsfund contribution requirements. At such time as PTC determines to makethese securities eligible for safekeeping and other services, the Commissionbelieves that, in order to decrease risk, PTC should not accept those securitiesto satisfy participants fund contribution requirements. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ The PSA, an association of brokers, dealers and banksactive in U.S. Government and securities markets, designates settlementdates for each class of securities in the mortgage-backed securities market.Generally, high-volume classes settle on the third Wednesday each monthand other classes settle on the Tuesday before the third Wednesday or thefollowing Monday.b. <T3>Collateral.</T3> PTC differs from most securities depositories registeredunder the Act in two important respects. First, PTC's rules require participantsto collateralize all movements that could expose PTC to financial loss.Other securities depositories generally do not provide explicit collateralizationrequirements.\36\<NOTE/> Second, PTC generally limits participant liability for PTC'spotential losses in connection with participant default to participantsthat received cash credits from the defaulting participant on the day ofdefault. Other securities depositories generally can assess all participants,pro rata, for such potential losses in excess of the defaulting participant'savailable assets subject to depository liens. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ An exception is the Depository Trust Company's Same-DayFunds Settlement (``SDFS'') Service, which provides settlement servicesfor transactions that settle in sameday funds and which requires full collateralizationon all transactions. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26051 (August31, 1988), 53 FR 34852.One of PTC's fundamental financial safeguards is that movements for valuemust be fully collateralized before they will be processed. Full collateralizationmeans that PTC at all times possesses sufficient cash or securities atleast equivalent in value to a transfer for payment for each transactionmade by a participant.\37\<NOTE/> PTC will not process an  account transfer versus paymentthat would result in negative ``net free equity'' \38\<NOTE/> for either the delivering participant or the receiving participantin the applicable account that is not offset by other collateral. Negativenet free equity can be offset by other collateral in the form of additionalcontributions to the participants fund.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ In valuing securities for collateralization purposes,PTC will discount or apply a ``haircut'' of 5% of the market value of thesecurities. Market value of securities is computed from securities pricesprovided daily by pricing services to which PTC subscribes. The pricingservices contact dealers that actively trade in the securities being priced.Three to five prices are obtained each day for each security for each typeand coupon rate. Extreme prices are discarded and the average of the remainingquotations constitutes the market value of the security in PTC for thefollowing day. PTC will review the validity and accuracy of prices on adaily basis and may from time to time reconsider and revise its pricingmethods. See letter from Lois J. Radisch, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley andamp;McCloy, to Jonathan Kallman, Assistant Director, Division, Commission,dated February 22, l989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ Net free equity measures the collateral available toPTC to pledge or liquidate in the event a participant defaults on its netdebit balance. Net free equity is defined separately for each of the threetypes of depository accounts. Net free equity for each account includes:(1) securities in the account on which PTC has a lien; (2) securities inthe associated transfer account; (3) the net credit or debit balance forthe account; (4) a portion of cash and securities deposited by the participantin the participants fund; and (5) securities in the proprietary accountof the participant, on which PTC has a lien, and the net credit balance,if any, for that proprietary account, to the extent that this collateralhas not been allocated to previous transactions. Net free equity does notinclude securities held in segregated accounts associated with the proprietaryand agency accounts, and PTC does not assert a lien over those segregatedpositions. c. <T3>Net Debit Monitoring Level.</T3> PTC rules require that a participant'saggregate net debit not exceed the individual ``net debit monitoring level''(``NDML'') set for that participant. The NDML is designed to provide PTC with sufficient end-of-day liquidity to complete settlement in the eventof a participant default. No participant will be permitted to incur anaggregate net debit balance for all of its master accounts in excess ofits NDML (even if the participant has a positive net free equity) exceptas senior PTC management may permit on a case-by-case basis. The maximumNDML for a participant will be the aggregate of the committed credit linesavailable to PTC for this purpose \39\<NOTE/> or a lesser amount which PTC may determine from time to time.The NDML for a particular participant will be determined according to anumber of factors, including the participant's financial condition reflectedin financial statements submitted to PTC, the type of business in whichthe participant is engaged and the committed lines of credit availableto the participant for settling transactions processed through PTC. A participantcan increase its NDML by arranging and paying for a committed line of creditwith an acceptable credit facility, upon which PTC may freely draw. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ See discussion accompanying notes 49-51, <T3>infra. </T3>PTC will monitor the net amount of a participant's debit and credit balancesfor all of its accounts. If a participant's aggregate net debit balancereaches 80% of its NDML, PTC's management will be alerted. PTC will notifythe participant and request it to monitor the situation. If the participant'saggregate net debit balance reaches its NDML, PTC will notify the participantand halt any transactions for the  participant that would increase theparticipant's aggregate net debit balance. PTC then will allow transactionsto proceed if the participant: (1) reduces its aggregate net debit balanceto within the NDML by prefunding or initiating an intraday transfer forpayment, or (2) effectively increases its NDML by arranging and payingfor a committed line of credit acceptable to PTC.A participant that has reached its NDML and intends to prefund its excessnet debit (to bring its net debit below its NDML) can request PTC seniormanagement for an extension of time to prefund (deposit cash into the participantsfund), during which time the participant can continue to trade (and increaseits net debit above its NDML).\40\<NOTE/> PTC can grant the request, subject to several conditions.Among other things, PTC will not allow the participant's net debit balanceto exceed twice its established NDML and PTC will not allow the aggregateof the excess net debits for all participants concurrently granted extensionsto exceed 300% of the committed credit lines \41\<NOTE/> of PTC. \42\<NOTE/> The latter condition is designed to limit PTC's ability togrant multiple extensions, thereby vitiating the safety gained from netdebit caps.\43\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ PTC will permit these requests only prior to 1:00 p.m.on the trading date. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ <T3>See </T3>discussion accompanying notes 49-51, <T3>infra.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ The other conditions are: <ITAG tagnum="28">1. The participant has positive net free equity and no transactionduring the extension would reduce the participant's net free equity toa negative position; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">2. Prior to granting the extension, the participant identifies toPTC the prefunding banks and the amount to be prefunded, to the satisfactionof PTC senior management; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">3. The extension is for no longer than ninety minutes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">PTC will grant extensions on a first-come, first-serve basis. If PTCreaches its aggregate excess net debit limit, or ``supercap,'' subsequentrequests for extensions will be queed and permitted to proceed in turnwhen the aggregate excess net debit is sufficiently reduced below the 300%limit to accomodate the extension. PTC has the discretion to grant an extensionfor up to ninety minutes, however, the Commission understands that PTCwill not permit an extension to last beyond 2:30 p.m. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">PTC has represented that the supercap is a transitional feature toallow participants to adjust to their NDMLs as PTC's activities increase.The net debit cap is a novel device in the mortgage-backed securities marketand for dealers generally. PTC will monitor its consequences closely andexpects that it will conduct a thorough review of the NDML system afterall GNMA securities coupon rates have been made eligible for deposit intoPTC. PTC intends to phase out the supercap within 3-6 months after itsreview. </ITAG><T3>See </T3>letter from Lois J. Radisch, Esq., Milbank, Tweed, Hadleyandamp; McCloy, to Jonathan Kallman, Assistant Director, Division, Commission,dated February 8, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ To address extremely urgent situations, however, PTChas the authority to waive or suspend its rules and procedures, includingthe supercap (<T3>See </T3>PTC Rules, Article VI, Rule 12). Those circumstances mightarise if halting participant transactions that exceed the aggregate excessnet debit limit would cause a participant or participants to default ordisrupt the market. <ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission directs PTC to report to the Commission, on a monthlybasis, until such time that the supercap is phased out or other time asthe Commission may direct, each instance in which the aggregate excessnet debit for all participants concurrently granted extensions exceedsl00% of the committed lines of credit of PTC. Such reports should includethe identity of participants granted extensions, the total of the aggregateexcess net debits and the duration of each instance. In addition, PTC shouldreport to the Commission, on a same-day basis, any instances in which PTCsuspends or waives the supercap and concurrently grants extensions in whichthe aggregate excess net debit exceeds 300% of its committed lines of credit.</ITAG>The purpose of PTC's NDML is to assure PTC and its participants that oneor more participants will not accumulate an intra-day net debit so largeas to compromise the integrity of PTC's system. Although all transactionsmust be fully collateralized to proceed, default by one or more participantswith a large net debit relative to PTC's committed lines of credit wouldstrain PTC's ability to meet its settlement obligations on the day of default.This concern is more significant in light of the anticipated increase inprocessing volume as more coupons become eligible for deposit into PTC.The Commission believes that the NDML is a practical response to a legitimateconcern not only for mortgage-backed securities and other securities thatsettle in same-day funds,\44\<NOTE/> but also for other areas of the securities industry.\45\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ The Depository Trust Company's SDFS System handles securitiesthat settle in same-day funds. See note 36, supra. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ Indeed, a net debit cap system of some type may havehad a positive effect had one been in place during the market break onOctober 19, 1987. <T3>See </T3>Division, The October 1987 Market Break, Chapter X, February1988. d. <T3>Collateral Loan Facility.</T3> A participant's ability to borrow tomeet its settlement obligations, or to pay an increased debit balance whena participant with whom it has dealt defaults, will be enhanced  by PTC'scollateral loan facility (``CLF''). CLF will allow participants to pledgesecurities in bulk to lenders by a transfer of securities to a receivingparticipant's pledgee account. CLF also can be used to effect bulk segregationmovements into a participant's own hold in custody account \46\<NOTE/> (and therefore borrow from a non-participant lender). UnderCLF, the segregating participant may either manually identify the securitiesit wishes to pledge or segregate or have CLF automatically select the securities.A CLF transaction may occur only if after giving effect to the transaction,both delivering and receiving accounts will have sufficient net free equityto cover settlement obligations on those accounts and the NDML of the receivingparticipant is not exceeded.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ A hold in custody account is a seg account not associatedwith a proprietary or agency account and into which participants transfersecurities for segregation purposes. e. <T3>Default Procedures.</T3> At the end of each business day, PTC willeffect cash settlement with its participants. Participants with a net debitbalance in any depository account must pay PTC the balance in immediatelyavailable funds (<T3>i.e., </T3>by Fedwire transfer).\47\<NOTE/> Shortly thereafter, PTC will pay those participants who havenet credit balances. PTC will make those payments in immediately availablefunds by deposit or Fedwire transfer to participants' designated settlementbank accounts.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ Funds transferred by Fedwire are available immediatelyfor delivery and are irrevocable once received. PTC is obligated to fund system-wide settlement, that is, to pay each participanthaving a net credit balance, regardless of whether any other participantwith a net credit balance has settled. To protect itself, PTC holds a lienon securities deposited to the participants fund and on securities in theproprietary and agency accounts, and retains ownership of securities transferredversus payment intraday (i.e., securities in the associated transfer accounts)until settlement is made. If a participant fails to pay a debit balance,PTC would take certain steps, as outlined below, to provide sufficientliquidity to cover the default until the participant pays PTC or PTC canliquidate the securities. PTC uses a five-step process to cover the default and to assess any remainingloss to certain participants that received funds from the defaulting participant.Generally, those steps are: (1) To offset against the unpaid debit balanceany credit balance in a proprietary account of the defaulting Participant,(2) to use PTC's own funds or borrow funds collateralized by the defaultingparticipant's securities, (3) to charge cash and securities deposited inthe participants fund by the defaulting participant, and if the defaultingparticipant is not insolvent, draw on the required cash deposits of otherparticipants, (4) to solicit voluntary ad hoc lending by participants orby outside banks, secured by the defaulting participant's collateral onthe books of PTC or otherwise, and (5) to borrow overnight from participantssecured by the pledge of the participant's collateral.\48\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ On December 23, 1988, PTC filed an amendment to its applicationfor registration as a clearing agency which included, among other things,procedures for financing settlement defaults by participants. See SecuritiesExchange Act Release No. 26457 (January 12, 1989), 54 FR 2251. See alsoPTC Rules, Article II, Rule 6, Section I. In the filing, however, PTC notedthat in the event of an inconsistency between its default rules and thedefault procedures, the December 23, 1988 default procedures will control.PTC's counsel has represented to the Commission that PTC expects to reviewPTC's default rules within the next few months and file changes with theCommission that will eliminate any apparent inconsistencies between therule and the procedures. See letter from Lois J. Radisch, Esq., Milbank,Tweed, Hadley andamp; McCloy, to Jonathan Kallman, Assistant Director, Division,Commission, dated February 8, 1989. The process described in this Orderreflects the participant default procedures filed on December 23, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="28">The changes to PTC's default procedures assure the finality of transactionsprocessed through PTC. Generally, once a transaction has been effected,PTC will not undo, or ``reverse,'' the transaction in trying to cover adefaulting participant's debit balance. The voluntary and involuntary loanaspects of the default procedures have replaced the reversal steps andare only used as an overnight source of funds. As described in the text,any loss resulting from an outstanding debit remaining the day after defaultwill be covered by assessments of those participants who traded with thedefaulting participant on the day of the default.</ITAG>PTC's first procedure in the event of default is to offset the defaultingparticipant's unpaid debit balance with any proprietary account creditbalance payable by PTC to the defaulting participant. If, for example,a defaulting participant maintained a proprietary account with a creditbalance and also maintained an agency or pledgee account with an unpaiddebit balance, PTC would charge the proprietary account credit balanceto cover the unpaid debit balance. If the cash available in the defaulting participant's proprietary accountis not sufficient to cover the default, PTC would use its own funds orborrow funds from third party lenders by pledging the defaulting participants'securities. PTC could pledge: (a) Securities held in the transfer accountassociated with the account in which the unpaid debit balance resides,(b) if the account in which the unpaid debit balance resides is a proprietaryor agency account, securities held in such account (but not securitiesin any associated seg account or hold in custody account), and (c) anyexcess securities in the associated proprietary account that are not neededto collateralize a proprietary account transaction. In addition, PTC wouldbe able to pledge securities in the participants fund for the master accountthat includes the account to which the debit balance relates and, to theextent necessary, any other master account of the defaulting participant.To facilitate borrowing under those procedures, PTC maintains a $250 millioncommitted line of credit to finance PTC's obligations in the event of aparticipant default. PTC intends to increase its committed lines of creditfrom $250 million to $2 billion during 1989 as PTC declares more securitiescoupon rates eligible for depository services and PTC's processing volumeincreases. If an unpaid debit balance remains after employing the above procedures,PTC would apply to the unpaid debit balance the cash portion of the defaultingparticipant's mandatory deposit to the participants fund in excess of therequired cash deposit for the master account which includes the accountwith the unpaid debit balance. In addition, PTC would apply proceeds fromthe liquidation of any securities not pledged pursuant to the above paragraphwhich reside in the participants fund for the master account which includesthe account with the unpaid debit balance. In both instances, PTC, to theextent necessary, may similarly apply cash and proceeds of liquidated securitiesfrom any other master accounts of the defaulting participant. In addition,if the defaulting participant is not insolvent, PTC may draw on the requiredcash deposits of other participants as well. If the above procedures cannot raise sufficient funds to cover the defaultingparticipant's unpaid debit balance, PTC would solicit voluntary ad hoclending by participants or by outside banks. PTC would secure the loanswith the defaulting participant's collateral. Finally, if further fundsare necessary, PTC would require its participants to lend funds overnightto PTC in the following order, secured by the defaulting participant'scollateral: first, from each participant which delivered to the defaultingparticipant that day, <T3>pro rata, </T3>based on the aggregate of contract values of deliveriesmade to the defaulting participant, and second, from some or all of theremaining participants. PTC may extend the time for the transfer of securitiesto pledgee accounts to accommodate this financing. Lending participantswould be repaid the following day when the default is cured or the defaultingparticipant's collateral is liquidated. If either PTC or any lending participant suffers a loss or incurs an obligationthat remains unsatisfied after the liquidation or if PTC cannot restorethe required cash deposits of non-defaulting participants, participantsthat received credits to their cash balances in transactions with the defaultingparticipant on the day of default would be assessed for the deficiencypro rata, based upon the amount of those credits. If an assessed participantthereupon defaults, its contra parties would be likewise assessed and soon. If a loss remains after the assessment process, it would be chargedto the undivided profits and retained earnings of PTC. PTC would, to thatextent, be paid first out of any recovery which shall thereafter be distributedto assessed participants, pro rata in accordance with the amounts assessed.The Commission believes that PTC's rules are well designed to limit PTC'sand its participants' risks related to participant payment defaults orinsolvencies. The requirement that all transactions be fully collateralized,the haircut on securities used as collateral, the individual limit on eachparticipant's aggregate net debit level and the ability to assess the requiredcash deposits of non-defaulting participants should minimize PTC's exposurein the event of default or insolvencies. PTC's plan to increase its committed lines of credit is essential to timelysettlements in the event of a participant default. Because a default islikely to occur only minutes before PTC must pay other participants insame-day funds, committed lines of available credit appear to be essential.\49\<NOTE/> Moreover, to the extent possible, no question should existin the event of a default that cash will be forthcoming from those facilities,for example, because of either a bank failure \50\<NOTE/> or, under the terms of the credit facility, lenders are notobligated to meet their credit commitments. \51\<NOTE/> Accordingly, as PTC increases its lines of credits from $250million to $2 billion, PTC will diversify its credit lines among severalfinancial institutions and will receive assurances that a participant defaultor an extraordinary decline in market prices will not affect PTC's abilityto draw on its credit lines.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ The Commission does not believe that committed linesof credit are the only way clearing agencies can secure funding to meettheir payment obligations. For example, clearing agencies could look toparticipants for emergency funds and draw on cash deposits in the participantsfund to meet settlement obligations. If a clearing agency intends to relyon this funding source, the amount of participants fund cash on depositwith the clearing agency in advance of a settlement failure should be sufficient,in combination with the clearing agency's credit facilities, to meet foreseeablecash requirements associated with a default. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ If PTC's credit lines were limited to a single lender,the failure of that lender could create financial exposure to PTC. <T3>Cf. </T3>Securities Exchange Release No. 21118 [(July 5, 1984), 49FR 2849I (File No. SR-OCC-84-8), approving a change in the Options ClearingCorporation's (``OCC'') rules authorizing OCC to draw against its clearingfunds in the event of a failure by a bank engaged in settling, on behalfof OCC, payment obligations to OCC clearing members]. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ Some credit agreements contain provisions that allowlenders to withhold credit in the event of a material adverse change inthe borrower's financial condition. Such provisions could defeat the purposeof a committed line of credit. The Commission believe that PTC's default procedures appropriately separatethe process of funding PTC's end-of-day payment obligations from the processfor allocating participant default losses. Because participants tend tocommit funds credited to their clearing agency accounts during the day_tomeet other payment obligations within the clearing agency or outside theclearing agency to lenders, customers and other dealers_requiring participantswho dealt with the defaulting participant to return those credits couldcreate a potential cascade of participant defaults. PTC's default proceduresspecifically incorporate substantial new credit sources and allow participantsto volunteer excess funds to help finance end-of-day settlements duringa crisis. Thus, PTC's rules and, when in place, PTC's enhanced credit facilities,will add substantial back-up liquidity to the settlement process and containthe risk of multiple defaults. The Commission believes that PTC's rules have been drafted to assure thatPTC will have title to, and perfected security interests in, securitiesthat serve as collateral for participant payment obligations. All securitiestransfers subject to money payment are held in a participant's appropriatetransfer account pending payment by the receiving participant. Those transfersare deemed to be transfers to PTC and PTC holds title to those securitiesuntil payment is made and the securities are transferred into the receivingparticipant's appropriate account. \52\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ This portion of the rules originally was drafted by MBSCC,which consulted with counsel to the NY Fed, clearing and custodian banks,dealers (including Bear Stearns), GNMA and other interested parties. 4. <T3>Standard of Care.</T3> The Standards provide that the rules of a clearingagency, subject to several exceptions, require the clearing agency to promptlydeliver securities in its custody or control to, or as directed by, theparticipant for whom they are held. \53\<NOTE/> The Standards exempt from that requirement securities deliveredagainst payment (for which the participant has not made payment) and securitiespledged by the participant through the clearing agency. The Standards alsorequire that a clearing agency's rules and agreements enable broker-dealersto comply with applicable provisions of the Act and related Commissionrules concerning protection of customer assets, such as Sections 8 and15 of the Act and Rules 8c-I, \54\<NOTE/> 15c2-1 \55\<NOTE/> and 15c3-3 under the Act. \56\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16900 (June 171980), 45 FR at 41930, at note 57. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ Rule 8c-1 generally prohibits a broker-dealer from comminglingcustomer securities under specified circumstances and from subjecting customersecurities to certain liens. Rule 8c-1(g) provides that customer securitiesand other securities may be held by a brokerdealer at a clearing agencythat maintains certificates in a fungible bulk and provides a system forsecurities hypothecation by bookkeeping entry. The rule states that suchan arrangement will not in and of itself violate Rule 8c-1 if certain conditionsare met. Those conditions generally require the clearing agency's custodianto agree not to refrain from promptly delivering such securities (otherthan securities then hypothecated in accordance with the system) to theclearing agency or as directed by the clearing agency itself. Rule 8c-1(g)also requires that the clearing agency system provide adequate safeguardsfor handling securities certificates, maintain fidelity bonding coverage,and be examined periodically by an independent public accountant. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ Rule 15c2-1 parallels Rule 8c-1 and prohibits hypothecationof customer securities under specified circumstances. Rule 15c2-1 providesbroader coverage than Rule 8c-1 by defining prohibited hypothecation ofcustomer securities to be a ``fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative actor practice'' under section 15(c)(2) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\56\ Rule 15c3-3 generally requires broker-dealers promptlyto obtain possession or control of securities purchased by customers andmaintain customers' fully-paid-for and excess-margin securities and freecredit balances in accounts that are free of liens and claims against thebroker-dealer.PTC's rules clearly provide for lien-free segregated accounts where participantscan maintain fully-paid-for securities in compliance with customer protectionrules in a number of ways. For example, participants can move securitiesto a segregated position free of any third party liens. Therefore, forthe reasons discussed in the MBSCC TRO,\57\<NOTE/> the Commission believes that PTC's rules are consistent withthe Act concerning the protection of customer assets and the standard ofcare with respect to deposited securities and property.\58\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\57\ <T3>See </T3>note 5, <T3>supra.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20221 (September 23, 1980),48 FR 45641, at notes 134-137.  D. Participation Standards Section 17A(b)(3)(B) of the Act lists certain categories of persons a clearingagency's rules must authorize as potentially eligible for access to clearingagency membership and services.\59\<NOTE/> Section 17A(b)(4)(B) of the Act contemplates that a registeredclearing agency have financial responsibility, operational capability,experience and competency standards that are used to accept, deny or conditionparticipation of any participant or any category of participants enumeratedin section 17A(b)(3)(B). In addition, the Standards state that a clearingagency's rules be designed to prevent unfair discrimination in the admissionof participants and among participants.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ Those persons include, among others: registered brokerdealers,other registered clearing agencies, registered investment companies, banksand insurance companies. PTC's rules provide that persons eligible for PTC membership and servicesinclude broker-dealers, banks, thrift institutions, insurance companies,investment companies, clearing agencies and any other firms which PTC maydetermine and which meet PTC qualifications. In addition, PTC providesa limited membership category for GNMA issuers, warehouse lenders and clearingagencies which limit their transactions to book-entry pledges from theirparticipants.  PTC membership standards require bank applicants to have equity capital,determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles(``GAAP''), of at least $100,000,000, and a broker or dealer should havenet capital determined pursuant to Rule 15c3-1 of the Act or liquid capitalafter deduction of haircuts determined pursuant to 17 CFR 402.2, of atleast $50,000,000. Any other type of applicant should maintain equity capitalor regulatory capital in at least equivalent amounts. A limited purposeparticipant applicant should have equity capital, determined in accordancewith GAAP, of at least $10,000,000, unless the applicant is a clearingagency, in which case the clearing agency should have a net worth acceptableto PTC. PTC's rules authorize PTC to grant admission to organizations thatdo not meet these standards where PTC determines that such standards areunfair to the applicant, PTC or other participants and limited purposeparticipants. The only commentator on the PTC application, Fiduciary Trust Company International(``Fiduciary''),\60\<NOTE/> argued that PTC should provide in more detail the factorsthat would serve to qualify a bank applicant with less than $100,000,000in equity capital and protect against arbitrary exclusion from the GNMAmarket. In its response,\61\<NOTE/> PTC stated that it will look at a number of criteria, includingthe amount of equity capital, in determining whether to waive the $100,000,000equity capital requirement. Specifically, it will review a number of factors,including:  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\60\ <T3>See </T3>note 4, <T3>supra.</T3>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ <T3>See </T3>letter from Lois J. Radisch, Esq., Milbank, Tweed, Hadleyandamp; McCloy, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission, dated January12, 1989. (1) The prospective participant's operational and management capabilities,which may affect its ability to monitor its positions and to satisfy itsobligations to PTC; (2) The anticipated volume of transactions to be processed through PTCfor the prospective participant, which will indicate the level of settlementexposure PTC will have with respect to that participant; (3) The type of transactions to be processed through PTC including, forexample, whether the prospective participant is a dealer trading as principalor an agent acting on behalf of others; if the potential participant wouldact in an agency capacity, PTC would examine what types of institutionsthe participant's customers are and whether it requires them to prefundtheir obligations to it; (4) The prospective participant's profitability and overall financial conditionas indicators of its ability to monitor and control its exposure and todischarge its obligations in a timely manner; and (5) If the prospective participant was a participant in the MBSCC DepositoryDivision, the participant's history of conformity to the rules and proceduresof the MBSCC Depository Division. (PTC will weigh heavily a good recordof performance in MBSCC among the factors it considers in reviewing anapplication.) Further, PTC notes that participants and applicants are protected fromthe arbitrary application of participation  standards by section 17A ofthe Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and by PTC's rules, whichprovide a right of appeal and a procedure to exercise that right in theevent that an application to participate is denied. The Commission believesthat PTC's flexible membership standards and criteria, along with the protectionafforded by PTC's rules and the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder,serve as protection against unfair discrimination in the admission of participantsinto PTC. All applicants are required to submit recent financial statements independentlycertified without qualification and copies of the applicant's or its parentguarantor's most recent financial filing to its appropriate regulatoryagency.\62\<NOTE/> An applicant must also satisfy PTC that it has sufficientfinancial ability to meet its obligations under PTC's rules. If admitted,a participant or limited purpose participant must maintain these minimumcapital requirements and must continue to submit audited financial statements.If a participant or limited purpose participant fails to meet these requirements,PTC is authorized to take a variety of actions, including notifying theparticipant or limited purpose participant that it has 30 days to satisfythe requirements, limiting the   participant's or limited purpose participant'sactivity, or ceasing to act for the participant.\63\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\62\ For example, if the applicant or its parent guarantoris a registered broker-dealer, the applicant must submit to PTC copiesof Form X-17A-5 FOCUS Reports to the Commission or its Form G-405 Reporton Finances and Operations to the U.S. Department of Treasury.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\63\ PTC will maintain a staff of credit analysts to monitorparticipants' and limited purpose participants' financial condition andwill alert PTC management if conditions warrant such notice. Although PTC's capital requirements for participants are substantiallyhigher than those of its predecessor,\64\<NOTE/> those requirements will increase user and investor confidencein PTC as a central depository providing long-term custodian services andintra-day settlement payment facilities, in same-day funds, for a multi-billiondollar market. Although some institutions may be unable to meet the capitalrequirements for direct PTC participation, these institutions can accessPTC's services through other PTC participants that offer clearing or custodialservices on a wholesale or retail basis.\65\<NOTE/> Moreover, any applicant denied membership in PTC has a rightto appeal such a denial to the Commission.\66\<NOTE/> Thus, the Commission believes that PTC has reached an appropriatebalance among the right of    access, any anti-competitive effect and theability of a clearing agency to protect itself and its participants fromunreasonable financial and operational risk.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\64\ MBSCC membership standards required applicants to havea minimum net worth of $10,000,000, except mortgage bankers, which musthave a net worth of $5,000,000. <T3>See </T3>MBSCC TRO, note 5, <T3>supra, </T3>at 4223. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\65\ Alternatively, these institutions might apply to PTCfor direct access to PTC services and assert that PTC should approve theapplication without strict regard to PTC's existing member capital requirements.The Commission expects that PTC will exercise its discretionary authorityjudiciously consistent with its responsibilities as a clearing agency tosafeguard securities and funds and its responsibility as a clearing agencyand SRO to administer its admission standards on a non-discriminatory basis.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\66\ <T3>See </T3>section 19(d) of the Act. E. Fair Reoresentation Section 17A(b)(3)(C) requires that a clearing agency's rules assure fairrepresentation to its participants and shareholders in the selection ofits directors and administration of its affairs. The Act does not definefair representation or set up particular standards of representation. Insteadit provides that the Commission must determine whether the rules of theclearing agency regarding the manner in which decisions are made give fairvoice to participants as well as to shareholders in the selection of directorsand the administration of its affairs. With respect to providing participantswith a meaningful opportunity to be represented in the selection of theboard of directors and the administration of the clearing agency's affairs,the Division's Standards counsel that each clearing agency's proceduresbe evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The Standards suggest that a numberof methods could comply with the fair representation standard. Those suggestionsinclude direct participation in the election of directors through the allocationof voting stock to all participants based on their usage of the clearingagency.\67\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\67\ The other suggestions in the Standards are: (1) solicitationof board of director nominations from all participants; (2) selection ofcandidates for election to the board of directors by a nominating committeewhich would be composed of, and selected by, the participants or representativeschosen by participants; (3) election by participants of a slate of nomineesfor which stockholders of the clearing agency would be required to votetheir shares; or (4) a number of directors chosen by, and from among, theparticipants. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16900 (June 17, 1980),45 FR 41930. PTC will provide participants with an opportunity to participate in theselection of directors and in the administration of its affairs throughstock ownership. PTC represents in its application that initially it intendsto provide all MBSCC Depository Division participants and known potentialPTC participants the opportunity to purchase shares of PTC. PTC intendsto issue one million shares of stock, par value $5.00 per share. Each interestedPTC participant is eligible to purchase an equal number of shares (thenumber of shares offered will be determined by the number of subscribers).Participants that choose not to purchase shares will not have a directvoice in the selection of directors or in the administration of PTC's affairs;these participants however, may later purchase shares during the reallocationprocess (described below) or through a private purchase from another shareholderparticipant. Each participant purchasing stock must execute a stockholders agreement.The stockholders agreement provides for the initial allocation of shares,imposes a limit on ownership of 5% or more of the shares issued and outstanding,and provides for an annual reallocation of shares among current and prospectivestockholders. All non-shareholder participants and shareholder participantsmay participate in the annual reallocation of PTC shares.\6\\8\<NOTE/> Shareholder participants may offer for sale some or all ofthe shares they hold. Participants are not required to purchase a specificnumber of shares during the annual reallocation process. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\8\ Shareholder and non-shareholder participants also maypurchase shares from current shareholders. Private purchases, however,generally will result in a process similar to the annual reallocation becausePTC and PTC shareholders have a right of first refusal on shareholder sales.The annual reallocation process will occur during the first quarter, beforethe April shareholders meeting where directors will be selected. PTC willhave the right to sell shares in each allocation, if it so decides. Participantsalso may sell their shares, but PTC's shares always will be allocated first.If demand for shares exceeds the supply of new and tendered shares, PTCwill seek regulatory approval to issue a sufficient number of shares tosatisfy the demand.\6\\9\<NOTE/>  Shareholders may hold only up to 5% of all PTC shares issuedand outstanding after giving effect to the reallocation. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\9\ PTC's registration application, as originally filedwith the Commission, provided that if demand exceeded the supply of newand tendered shares, participants who did not seek to buy shares must sellshares to purchasers. The Commission staff, however, was concerned thatsuch a procedure would result in an inequitable allocation of shares becauseparticipants that wish to maintain their holdings during reallocation maybe forced to sell off part of their positions if demand for shares exceedsthe supply of shares. This could result in a situation where a participant,during reallocation, would need to show an interest in purchasing sharesjust to maintain its holdings. On December 23, 1988, PTC amended its registrationapplication to more fairly allocate shares to participants seeking ownershipparticipation. Under the amended stockholders agreement, PTC will use itsbest efforts to issue more shares if demand exceeds the supply of new andtendered shares. PTC needs approval of the New York State Banking Departmentto issue more shares. If such approval is not forthcoming, PTC will allocate<T3>pro rata</T3> the supply of new and tendered shares to participantswishing to purchase shares. The process, while not allocating shares to shareholders directly in proportionto their use of PTC, does allow a participant to decide whether to purchasenone, some or all the shares allocated to that participant. The allocationand reallocation process allows each participant to place its own economicvalue on its participation in the selection of directors and in the administrationof PTC's affairs and thus choose its participation level in accordancewith its use and the economic benefits that the participant perceives fromits participation in PTC. Moreover, the 5% limit of ownership restrictsone or a few large participants from effectively controlling PTC to thedetriment of smaller participants. The Commission believes that it is reasonableto conclude that participants are afforded a reasonable opportunity toacquire voting stock of PTC, indirectly, in reasonable proportion to theiruse of such clearing agency and, thus, that the plan for representationof participants is fair.The proposed stockholders agreement, PTC By-Laws and PTC Organization Certificateset the guidelines for the election of directors and conduct of business.The stockholders agreement provides for cumulative voting in the electionof directors. Shareholders may cast as many votes for one or more candidatesas it has shares times the number of directors positions to be selected.Candidates for the director positions are recommended by the nominatingcommittee. The PTC By-Laws provide that the nominating committee consistof three persons, each of whom may or may not be a director, designatedby a resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board of Directors(``Board''). The By-Laws state that the Board will consist of 10 directors unless changedas allowed by the Banking Law of the State of New York. Shareholders can,by a majority vote at a meeting where a quorum is present,\70\<NOTE/> vary the number of directors to as few as 7 or as many as20. The By-Laws do not provide for the Board to vote upon a change in thenumber of directors; however, vacancies not exceeding one-third of theentire Board may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term by amajority vote of the directors then in office. A majority of directorsthen in office present at a meeting constitutes a quorum and an issue willbe decided by a majority of those directors. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\ The By-Laws provide that a majority of shares entitledto vote present at a meeting, either in person or by proxy, constitutesa quorum of shareholders.The By-Laws may be amended or repealed by either a \2/3\ affirmative voteof the Board or by a \2/3\ affirmative vote of shareholders having thepower to vote at the time the amendment is sought. Thus, although the Boarddoes not have the power to change the number of directors constitutingthe Board, it could provide itself that power to do so by amending theBy-Laws. A by-law adopted by shareholders, however, may provide that suchby-law shall not be subject to amendment or repeal by the Board. Therefore,the shareholders can exercise ultimate control over the nature of the By-Laws.The selection of PTC directors conforms to the Commission's Standards.The stockholders agreement and the By-Laws allow each participant to votebased upon the number of shares it owns. In addition, the By-Laws callfor cumulative voting to provide small participants and those who representdiffering views from the majority of shareholders a greater opportunityto participate on the Board and in the administration of PTC's affairs.Also, shareholders may amend the By-Laws to provide direction to the Boardand can insure the integrity of those changes by restricting the Boardfrom amending them. Thus, the Commission believes that the process of selectingdirectors provides participants a fair voice in the selection of directorsand in the administration of PTC. The Commission believes that PTC's governance structure is designed toassure fair representation of PTC participants and shareholders. The allocationand annual reallocation process provides each participant the opportunityto purchase an interest in PTC and to adjust that interest upward or downwardon at least an annual basis. The stockholders agreement balances the rightto buy stock in proportion to use of PTC services with the potential fora large concentration of stock in one or a few shareholders. Finally, theBy-Laws provide shareholder participants the power to choose directorsand direct the administration of PTC affairs through cumulative voting.F. Other Determinations <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Capacity to Comply With the Act and Enforce Compliance by Membersand Participants</ITAG>Section 17A(b)(3)(A) of the Act requires that PTC have the capacity tocomply with the provisions of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.Commission rules require PTC to keep and preserve certain records, \71\<NOTE/> obtain and retain fingerprints from personnel, \72\<NOTE/> and register and participate in the Commission's Lost andStolen Securities Program. \73\<NOTE/> The Commission staff intends to monitor PTC to assure itscompliance with the Act. Based upon a review of PTC's rules and procedures,and the Commission's experience with PTC's predecessor, the MBSCC DepositoryDivision, the Commission believes PTC has the capacity to comply with theAct and the rules thereunder.\74\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ Rule 17a-1 requires a registered clearing agency to keepand preserve at least one copy of all documents, including correspondence,memoranda, papers, books, notices, accounts, and other records as are madeor received by it in the course of business. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\ Rule 17f-2 requires a registered clearing agency to obtainand maintain a record of fingerprints of each of its directors, officers,and employees who do not qualify for an exemption from fingerprinting containedwithin the rule. A copy of each set of fingerprints also must be sent tothe Federal Bureau of Investigation. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\73\ Rule 17f-1 requires a registered clearing agency to registerand participate in the Lost and Stolen Securities Program (``Program'').Under the Program, a participant is required to report the discovery ofa theft or loss of a security and to inquire with respect to securitieswhich come into its possession whether the security has been reported lost,missing or stolen. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\74\ The Commission notes that MBSCC, pursuant to Rule 17a-4of the Act, is required to keep a copy of all documents, for a period offive years, made or received by the Depository Division in the course ofits business and in the conduct of its regulatory activity. <T3>See</T3> 17 CFR 240.17a-4. In that regard, PTC has agreed to maintainand preserve on behalf of MBSCC the Depository Division's books and records,to permit examination of such by the Commission and to furnish to the Commissioncopies of any or all such records. <T3>See</T3> letter from Michael Urkowitz, Vice Chairman, PTC, to JosephB. McDonald, Jr., Staff Attorney, Division, Commission, dated March 1,l989. Section 17A(b)(3)(A) of the Act also requires PTC to have the capacityto enforce member compliance with its rules. PTC must have the authorityand ability to discipline participants that violate PTC's rules with appropriatesanctions for such violations \75\<NOTE/> and must provide fair procedures for the imposition of suchsanctions. \76\<NOTE/> Inasmuch as PTC's rules for disciplinary procedures to enforcecompliance with its rules are almost identical to those of its predecessor,the MBSCC Depository Division, whose rules the Commission previously consideredand found consistent with the Act, \77\<NOTE/> the Commission believes that PTC has the ability to enforcemember compliance with its rules. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\75\ <T3>See</T3> section 17A(a)(3)(G) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\76\ <T3>See</T3> section 17A(a)(3)(H) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\77\ <T3>See</T3> MBSCC TRO, note 5, <T3>supra</T3>, for a discussion regarding MBSCC's ability to enforce membercompliance with its rules. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Competition</ITAG>Section 17A of the Act directs the Commission to have due regard for themaintenance of fair competition among brokers, dealers, clearing agencies\78\<NOTE/> and transfer agents. \79\<NOTE/> Section 17A(b)(3)(I) provides that a clearing agency's rulesnot impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtheranceof the purposes of the Act. In MBSCC's TRO, the Commission stated in itsdiscussion that it believed that MBSCC fulfilled the requirements of thissection of the Act. After 2 years of operation as a clearing agency, theCommission believes that MBSCC has continued to comply with the fair competitionrequirements of the Act. The Commission believes that PTC's buyout of MBSCC'sDepository Division will bring to PTC MBSCC's due regard for fair competition.Therefore, the Commission believes that PTC's rules and its registrationas a clearing agency will not impose any inappropriate burdens on competition,and in all likelihood, will promote increased competition. \80\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\ PTC is the only clearing agency that provides depositoryservices for mortgage-backed securities. PTC will perform this functionin a manner that is complementary to MBSCC's Clearing Division services.Therefore, the Commission does not believe PTC's registration would directlyaffect clearing agency competition. Nonetheless, PTC's rules provide thatall clearing agencies are eligible for participation in PTC. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ Only a limited number of transfer agents service mortgage-backedsecurities. GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC each appoint the transfer agent for theirsecurities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\80\ <T3>See </T3>MBSCC's TRO, <T3>supra,</T3> note 5, for a more complete discussion on fair competition.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. PTC Fees </ITAG>Section 17A(b)(3) of the Act requires a clearing agency's rules to allocateequitably among participants reasonable fees, dues, and other charges.That section also provides that clearing agency rules not impose any scheduleof prices, or fix rates, for services rendered by participants. The Commissionhas reviewed PTC's fee schedules and found each service fee to apply equallyto all participants using that service. Moreover, the Commission believesthat PTC fees are reasonably based on near-term volume estimates and inmany instances, provide significant cost savings compared to clearanceand settlement outside PTC's system. Finally, PTC's rules do not in anymanner impose prices or fix rates for services provided by its participants.Accordingly, the Commission believes that PTC's rules and fees are consistentwith the above statutory standards. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusions and Determinations </ITAG>PTC has made an application for registration as a clearing agency pursuantto sections 17A(b) and 19(a)(1) of the Act and the Commission has madethe following determinations: (1) That PTC is so organized and has thecapacity to be able to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance andsettlement of securities transactions for which it is responsible; to safeguardsecurities and funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible;to assure fair representation to its participants and members in the selectionof its directors and administration of its affairs; to comply with theprovisions of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and to carryout the purposes of section 17A of the Act; (2) that the rules of PTC donot impose any schedule of prices, or fix rates or other fees for servicesrendered by its participants; (3) that the rules of PTC are designed topromote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securitiestransactions, to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds whichare in its custody or control or for which it is responsible, to fostercooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance andsettlement of securities transactions, to remove impediments to and perfectthe mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearanceand settlement of securities transactions, and in general, to protect investorsand the public interest; and (4) that the rules of PTC do not impose anyburden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of thepurposes of the Act. <T3>It is ordered,</T3> That PTC's registration be and it hereby is granted,subject to the terms contained in this order, this 28 day of March, 1989,to be effective for not more than 12 months.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
