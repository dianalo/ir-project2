STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LEIPZIG, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Air and water pollution havereached crisis proportions in East Germany, and Western experts sypollutants are taking a heavy toll in West Germany as far as theNorth Sea.   West German officials are considering an offer of money andtechnology to help the East German communist government clean it up.   ``The water quality of the Elbe River is particularly criticalwhen it reaches West Germany,'' said Karl Huthmacher, a spokesmanfor the West German Environmental Protection Ministry. ``Airpollution has also reached dangerous levels.''   The Greenpeace ecological group's West German branch said theElbe carries wastes to the North Sea, where ``plant and animal lifeare seriously threatened and destroyed.''   It also said human health is also increasingly at risk fromcontaminated drinking water.   In Leipzig and many East German cities, power plants usinghigh-sulphur brown coal belch out huge clouds of smoke that stingsthe eyes and coats buildings with black soot. Heavy exhaust fumesfrom cars, trucks and buses further foul the air.   Western studies indicate that East Germany pumps more pollutioninto the atmosphere than any other country in Europe, includingnearly 5 million tons a year of sulphur dioxide, according to WestGerman surveys.   After the oil price rises in the 1970s, East Germanyincreasingly turned to its considerable brown coal reserves.   Statistics on the extent of pollution are not made public inEast Germany, but the government is under pressure to release them.   An East German ecological group called the Green Network Archehas demanded that the government ``stop treating evidence ofenvironmental pollution as state secrets.''   Underground ecology newspapers detailing local pollutionproblems are frequently seized.   While East German officials have shown an increased willinglessto work with West Germany on environmental problems, Westernexperts say they are still a long way from concrete and effectivemeasures.   ``Working groups from both sides are still working to come upwith an acceptable program to help reduce the problems,'' saidMarlene Muehe, a spokeswoman for the West German EnvironmentalMinistry in Bonn.   East German officials said at a recent environmental conferencein East Berlin that a number of new projects had been launched toreduce river pollution and that the Elbe River would likely becleaned up by 1992.   Hans Reichelt, East Germany's Minister for EnvironmentalProtection, was quoted in the state-run media as saying that allnew and refitted power plants would be equipped with filtrationdevices beginning next year.   But West German officials say that in order to make anysubstantial progress soon, West Germany will have to provide theEast Germans with technology and financial assistance.   While East Germany was the first Eastern European nation toenact strict environmental laws, the guidelines are rarelyenforced, Western officials say.   West German government studies indicate that cleanup tasks willbe difficult because East Germany has largely abandonedenvironmental protection programs in recent years.   ``The last two five-year plans have contained neither a detailedenvironmental program nor funds to carry out projects outlined inearlier plans,'' a West German government study said.   ``Because of increasing economic pressures, East Germany hasmade industrial growth and increased production a priority overenvironmental protection.''   West German officials, who are grappling with the heavilyindustrialized nation's own formidable environmental problems, saythe East German pollution is of grave concern.   ``Our own efforts to correct environmental problems are madesignificantly more difficult because of the East Germanpollutants,'' Environmental Protection Ministry spokesmanHuthmacher said in Bonn, referring to efforts to clean up thenation's rivers and to reduce emissions that cause acid rain.   West Germany's forests have suffered considerable damage becauseof acid rain.   Environmental experts also say East German factories dump tonsof untreated industrial wastes into waterways where it mixes withthe runoff from fields treated with nitrate fertilizers.   Many major rivers flow into West Germany.   According to Greenpeace, more than 100 tons of waste _ includingheavy metals, industrial sludge, raw sewage and pesticides _ flowinto the Elbe River each day in East Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
