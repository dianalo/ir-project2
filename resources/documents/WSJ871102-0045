After seeing final numbers on the evening news, she was amazed at how the Oct. 19 crash had crept up on investors who had been predicting the Dow Jones Industrial Average would climb to 3600. And later that night, she had trouble keeping her mind on a midterm exam in portfolio management. &quot;It's hard to concentrate . . . when you feel like the world is coming to an end,&quot; she says.    If you think Ms. Buckwash was overreacting for a student merely learning the ins and outs of business and finance, think again. Because of the market's plunge, she and 13 fellow students lost roughly $200,000 on paper in their roles managing a portfolio that is still valued at more than a million dollars for the Fort Worth school's Educational Investment Fund.    The TCU fund is one of the oldest and largest of some 25 to 30 little-known student-run investment funds at business schools around the country. Such funds are intended to give future investment analysts and portfolio managers real-life experience managing money -- and right now they're getting plenty.    Like a lot of investors in the current market, Ms. Buckwash and her TCU associates are furiously trying to figure out how to defend their remaining capital and recoup some of their losses. So far -- to their intellectual dismay -- it looks to them as if that means steering away from the exciting telecommunications and biotechnology growth stocks, and toward the more sedate dividend-producing utilities, blue-chip standbys and bonds.    Indeed, Randall Rapp, the fund's 23-year-old administrator, questions the wisdom of holding many stocks. &quot;Looking at the volatile swings in the stock market,&quot; he says, &quot;I'm not sure a fund like this needs to be heavily in the market right now.&quot;    Such concerns are shared by other student fund managers. At the University of Wisconsin, for instance, students running half of a two-fund portfolio decided last week to bail out of stocks entirely until the dust settles. They had previously kept about 75% of their fund's money in stocks. Altogether, the portfolio lost $40,000 of its $280,000 value in the crash.    Although the goal of the campus funds is to give students a taste of managing real money, the experience lacks some reality. To begin with, angry investors don't pull their money for poor performance, and careers aren't on the line.    At TCU, for example, about 15 rotating fund managers are &quot;hired&quot; through competitive essays and interviews. Though they don't get paid, they do earn six hours' course credit and gain experience they hope will lead to jobs. (Under the terms of the TCU fund's establishment, it does pay out 6% of its net asset value annually -- $74,000 last year -- to TCU and the ophthalmology department at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, but the schools don't rely on the money.)    Moreover, students are more likely to be graded on the quality of their investment analysis than on the actual performance of their funds. This means that, in a situation like the present one, they could get A's without making up their dollar losses -- an arrangement they aren't likely to find on Wall Street.    For these reasons, some students found the market crash more exciting than depressing. &quot;If I had a job right now and the market crashed, I'd be concerned about whether I still had a job and could pay the rent; this is a more sheltered existence,&quot; says Joel Damiani, a University of Wisconsin graduate student who switched to finance from medical school because he wanted a faster-track career.    At TCU, encouraging creative investing was the objective of William C. Conner, the businessman who founded the fund in 1973 with a $600,000 stock grant. But the most recent lesson was in humility. The crash slashed the fund, which peaked in August at $1.35 million, to $1.1 million. The blow was partly softened by the fact that less than half of the fund's assets were in stocks; their value alone fell almost 25%.    &quot;We're the first (student managers) to lose money in two years,&quot; says H. Daniel Jones, a 27-year-old former oil-field worker now studying for an M.B.A.    Last Monday, for example, Battle Mountain Gold, which the fund had purchased at $28 a share, closed at $14.125; Subaru of America Inc., bought at $11.875, closed at $6.625; and Cray Research Inc. closed at $51.25, down from its purchase price of $72.10. Two stocks Ms. Buckwash had recommended -- Pfizer Inc. and American Express Co. -- were down 34.6% and 34.3%, respectively, from their purchase prices. Only Philip Morris Cos., another of her recommendations, and Pacific Telesis Group remained winners.    Still, the TCU bunch could have done worse. At the crash, close to half of their assets were in cash, and a small portion in bonds, because of &quot;strategy, organization and luck,&quot; says Cesar Prieto, a 27-year-old graduate student and one of the portfolio's managers. Some of the money was awaiting reinvestment, as routinely happens at the start of the semester; some the students had been holding back because of their uncertainty.    Trustees had even chided the students for not taking advantage of the stock market when it was still rising. Mr. Conner himself recalls thinking the students were &quot;a little cash heavy.&quot; But now, he concedes, &quot;they've proven me wrong.&quot;    What effect the market's recent gains will have on future plans remains to be seen. As of last week, the managers were planning to invest more in bonds, though studying credit-worthiness at twice-weekly classroom sessions doesn't appeal nearly as much as analyzing capital-gains potential. &quot;When we think of bonds, we think of retired people,&quot; says Patrick McCormack, a finance professor and the group's faculty adviser.    In addition, they're buying a different type of stock. Last Tuesday, the group voted more than $35,000 for 1,200 shares of Oklahoma Gas andamp; Electric, a small utility with steady earnings and nothing to do with nuclear power. (The students don't oppose nuclear power for political reasons; they dislike its economics.) Previously, the utility's 7.7% dividend yield would have looked too puny, and the likely choice would have been a technology stock.    The students would also like to try short-selling -- that is, selling borrowed stock in the expectation that its price will fall, allowing the investor to pocket the difference when it's replaced. But that's taboo under the fund's current ground rules.    Despite some disappointments and the market's fall, investment management and analysis are still where most of the student fund managers want jobs -- if there are jobs to be had. But TCU's Mr. Prieto acknowledges doing some hard thinking in recent days. A corporate-finance job, he says, suddenly looks as attractive as an investment job on Wall Street. His quandary: &quot;Whether I want to go up fast and down fast, or I just want to go up steadily.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
