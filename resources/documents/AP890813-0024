President Bush signed the bill, at $159 billion the largestfinancial rescue in the nation's history, in a Rose Garden ceremonyattended Wednesday by smiling Cabinet secretaries and leaders ofCongress.   ``It'll safeguard and stabilize America's financial system andput in place permanent reforms so these problems will never happenagain,'' he said before handing out souvenir pens to legislatorswho helped pass the law.   But a growing group of conservative, and somenot-so-conservative, thinkers believe Bush can't really make thatpromise until policy-makers tackle the politically explosive issueof deposit insurance reform.   White House economic advisers, just before President Reagan leftoffice, tried to raise the issue, suggesting that deposit insuranceought to be ``curbed.'' But, even that vague recommendation raiseda firestorm of criticism in Congress.   Rather than mire emergency Sandamp;L legislation in endless debate,the Bush administration decided to postpone the question byordering the Treasury Department to study the issue and report itsfindings in 18 months.   Academic analysts, however, say the debate should not have beenpostponed. They argue that it is deposit insurance that not onlyput each taxpayer on the hook for $1,000 over 30 years, butencouraged Sandamp;Ls to run up the losses in the first place.   In a phenomenon economists call ``moral hazard,'' thrifts thathad lost their owners' investment had every incentive to gamblewith federally insured deposits.   If outlandish loans to sperm banks and windmill farms paid off,Sandamp;L owners recovered earlier losses. If the investments soured, asthey usually did, the insurance fund had to pay.   ``The perverse incentives of federal deposit insurance allowedthe drunk drivers of the Sandamp;L world to operate without paying anymore for insurance than their sober brothers,'' said Bert Ely, afinancial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.   He advocates privatizing the system by allowing banks to formsyndicates to cross-guarantee one another. Banks with riskyportfolios would pay higher deposit insurance fees, instead of theflat rate all banks pay to the government no matter how well run.   Ely's plan is just one of many floating around. Some, like his,would do away with the federal system established in 1934 as thecure to the wave of bank failures that swept the nation in theearly years of the Depression. Others would tinker with, but notabolish, the system in an attempt to inject more ``depositordiscipline.''   John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp, the nation's largest bank,advocates reducing the $100,000 per account insurance limit andsubjecting deposits over that to a 10 percent to 15 percent``haircut'' in the event of failure.   That system, similar to Great Britain's, would, in effect,impose a deductible.   Just as motorists who have to pay the first $200 damage from anauto accident in theory drive more carefully than fully-insured carowners, depositors who could lose some of their money will pay moreattention to where they open accounts.   Other reform proposals, such as one offered by William M. Issac,former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., would limitdepositors to one insured account in an attempt to get at thepractice of brokering deposits, that is splitting large sums into$100,000 pieces and parceling them out to different institutions sothe entire amount is insured.   All of the proposals likely will be examined by the TreasuryDepartment in its study. After that, in early 1991, the issuereturns to Congress.   But few are expecting Congress to approve anything butincremental changes at most.   ``I suspect it will not promote anything radical,'' said L.William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, which under last week'slegislation now insures Sandamp;L deposits as well as bank accounts.   ``We have just invented a whole new logo (for banks and Sandamp;Ls)saying the government's full faith and credit is behind thosedeposits. I think any attempt to change that will be verydifficult,'' said Seidman, whose agency released its own studyearly this year concluding that the benefits of deposit insuranceoutweigh the drawbacks.   Those who oppose tinkering with deposit insurance make threearguments: that the system has worked, preventing bank runs for thepast five decades; that doing away with the system would forcebanks to lend only to big organizations, drying up credit to smallbusinesses, and that curbing deposit insurance would help big bankholding companies at the expense of small community institutions.   One premise of advocates of insurance reform is that a bank run,a contained bank run, is not something to fear more than thefailure of any other kind of business. Rather, the threat of a runacts to encourage sound banking.   ``The Depression so traumatized us that we don't even want tothink about a bank failure,'' said George G. Kaufman, a professorat Loyola University in Chicago. ``An individual bank run is reallynot bad at all except for the individual bank. If a bank thinksthere is a possibility of a run, they're going to behave a lotdifferently than if they don't.''   The flaw in that argument, according to Robert Litan of theBrookings Institution, a liberal oriented think tank in Washington,is that regulators can never be sure a bank run won't spread. Eventhe healthiest banks don't have enough cash to pay off alldepositors all at once and just a hint of trouble can spark a run.   ``In theory, there's nothing wrong with letting one bank fail,''Litan said. ``But any policy-maker faced with that choice generallydoesn't want to go down in the history books as running anexperiment that allowed the system to go down.''   Moreover, according to Seidman, for depositor discipline towork, depositors must be able to easily and quickly determine theirbank's condition.   ``I don't think we can depend upon depositors to know on a dailybasis the condition of their banks. We (at the FDIC) have greatproblems doing that, even with thousands of bank supervisors,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
