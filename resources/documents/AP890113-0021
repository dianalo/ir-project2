Such an accelerator would produce far less radioactive waste thana nuclear reactor and ``should be more readily acceptable to thepublic,'' according to a draft summary of the report obtained by TheAssociated Press on Thursday.   The U.S. supply of tritium, a radioactive gas used to producenuclear warheads, is threatened by the crumbling condition of theEnergy Department's existing weapons plants and reactors.   The report, prepared by scientists at the Brookhaven and LosAlamos national laboratories and at Westinghouse-Hanford Co. inWashington state, concluded that an accelerator could produce enoughtritium to meet all U.S. weapons needs.   An accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomicparticles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a target,in this case lithium clad in aluminium. The resulting collisionproduces tritium.   According to the report, using such an accelerator to maketritium would not produce any ``long-lived'' nuclear wastes and``costs associated with safety and environmental concerns should beminimal.''   In addition, it said, an accelerator ``does not have thelicensing requirements associated with nuclear reactors and shouldbe more readily acceptable to the public.''   Last July, the department recommended building two new productionreactors, one at the Savannah River complex near Aiken, S.C., andthe other at the Idaho Falls National Laboratory in Idaho.   At present, the nation's only facilities for producing tritiumare three reactors at Savannah River, but all three are shut downeither for maintenance or because of safety problems.   Department officials have said that at least one of the reactorsshould be back on line this year, but the start-up date continues toslip as more problems are found.   The department's Energy Research Advisory Board looked``briefly'' at using an accelerator to produce tritium, but ended uprecommending construction of two new reactors, said Chris Sankey, aDOE spokeswoman.   ``The board concluded that these technologies were not matureenough to provide new production capacity in the next 10 to 12years,'' she said.   But the DOE report said that the nation's tritium needs could bemet by using an accelerator ``that could be in operation as early as1996.''   By comparison, the proposed new reactors are expected to take aminimum of 10 years to complete.   ``The required accelerator technology has largely beendemonstrated at the component level although some additionaldevelopment work is desirable to effect cost reductions, improvedperformance and ease of operation,'' the report said.   The accelerator would take massive amounts of electricity tooperate, roughly the entire output of a nuclear power plant. Onepotential site for it would be in the Pacific Northwest, which hasthe cheapest electric rates in the nation.   The report said ``preliminary discussions'' with the BonnevillePower Administration indicated that the federal power marketingagency based in Portland, Ore., would have enough electricityavailable to power an accelerator.   An accelerator could cost more to build, but because the cost ofoperating it would be about half that of a reactor, ``total lifecycle costs,'' including construction, would be about 25 percentless, said Pierre Grand, a scientist at Brookhaven.   The two planned new reactors would cost an estimated $6.8 billion.   Grand acknowledged that ``those are ballpark figures and we needto do a lot more work to come up with firm estimates.''   But he said he was convinced that construction of an acceleratorwould ``alleviate all the safety, licensing and waste problems''associated with a reactor.   Grand said that while radioactive waste would be produced, ``youwon't have the transuranic wastes that are the culprits in terms oflong-term storage.''</TEXT></DOC>
