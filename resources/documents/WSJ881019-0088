Apple Computer Inc., IBM, Hewlett-Packard Co. and others use PostScript in their personal computers for &quot;desktop publishing&quot; -- professional typesetting. Consequently, PostScript has become a standard language for printing high-quality documents on desktop laser printers.    The new version of PostScript developed with IBM, which is based in Armonk, N.Y., will extend that standard into much larger computer systems, and will allow personal computers to exchange complex documents and images with mainframe computers.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, shares of Adobe, a software concern, rose 25 cents to close at $46.    Separately, IBM unveiled software products that make it easier for users of certain office systems to exchange electronic mail. Users of office systems made by IBM, Digital Equipment Corp. and Wang Laboratories Inc. can send and receive electronic mail to each other with the software. </TEXT></DOC>
