That merger has created alot of opportunities,'' said Clark Glymour, head of Carnegie MellonUniversity's philosophy department. ``More people are being drawninto it, and not for the traditional reasons.''   In general, ``programmers are a dime a dozen,'' Glymour said.``What is needed are people who can take vaguely formed problemsand find ways to make them precise enough to be programmed.''   American colleges and universities conferred 41,889 bachelor'sdegrees in computer science and 40,521 in psychology during the1985-86 academic year, the latest figures available from theNational Center for Education Statistics. That compares to 3,265 inphilosophy and 470 in linguistics.   To help meet the demand for computer-conscious philosophers andlinguists, Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh'slinguistics department have developed a doctorate program incomputational linguistics.   The goal is to produce people who can do more than merely writecomputer programs based on others' ideas, who can, in fact, developprograms that better understand and emulate how humans talk andthink.   ``You can't have really robust, healthy technology without ascience behind it, and we don't yet have the science,'' saidRichmond Thomason, professor of linguistics and philosophy at theUniversity of Pittsburgh. ``So what we have to do is learn enoughabout human language and reasoning to understand what it is we'retrying to do once we get these machines to do something.''   Sixteen students have been accepted into the program, one ofonly a few in the world, in its two years of existence. Thoseskilled in the area have landed high-paying, high-powered jobs,unlike many of their more traditional brethren.   ``There is a certain kind of stereotype about philosophy that'squite popular,'' Glymour said. ``Think about what would distress aparent more than to pay a hefty tuition and discover Sammy orSamantha is going to study philosophy. The stereotype is acompletely impractical and perhaps an even self-indulgent endeavor.   ``The fact of the matter is ... 20th century philosophy hascreated through various pieces of work all kinds of technicaltraditions.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sept. 8</NOTE></DOC>
