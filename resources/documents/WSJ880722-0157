Israel survived only because its valiant soldiers knew they had no choice but to hang on, and because the U.S. responded with a military resupply mission of extraordinary dimension.    2) When Mr. Royster points out that not all of Israel's (Arab) &quot;inhabitants&quot; are voting citizens, he seems to be criticizing Israel for not allowing Arabs of the West Bank and Gaza to vote in Israeli elections. All adult Arab citizens of Israel have the right to vote in Israeli elections, and 10% of all the votes cast in the last parliamentary election were Arab. The West Bank and Gaza have not been annexed by Israel, their Arab inhabitants are not citizens, and so they are not entitled to vote in Israeli elections.    3) The Palestinians were not &quot;put {in limbo} by Jews.&quot; The Palestinians lived under occupation by Jordan and Egypt for 19 years before the 1967 war. They were put in limbo by Arabs. Israel inherited them and their statelessness in a war forced upon it by Arabs. And it is Arabs who have steadfastly refused to negotiate with Israel (a principle vehemently restated in June 1988) for an end to the statelessness from which the Palestinians suffer and an end to the state of war from which Israel suffers.    We regard Mr. Royster as a warm, fair-minded friend and urge him to revisit Israel soon.    Herbert A.
