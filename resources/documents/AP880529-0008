SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan becomes the first U.S.leader in 14 years to step foot on Soviet soil Sunday, carrying theonly superpower treaty to ban an entire class of nuclear weapons.   But the summit was clouded by uncertainties that developedSaturday, when U.S. officials said prospects had faded for signingthree secondary arms agreements and the Soviets harshly criticizedU.S. aid to Afghan rebels.   Reagan and his wife Nancy were scheduled to board Air Force Onemidmorning for a 90-minute flight to Moscow and the president'sfourth summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The coupleplanned to bid farewell to Finnish President Mauno Koivisto and hiswife, Tellervo, at an airport ceremony.   The Reagans spent three days in this Baltic capital recuperatingfrom jet lag and preparing for their historic five-day visit toMoscow.   Reagan's chief of staff, Howard H. Baker Jr. arrived in Helsinkion an overnight flight from Washington, bringing with him the newlyratified Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty (INF).   Baker carried two bulging briefcases into the VIP lounge at theHelsinki airport, where he waited to link up with Reagan for theflight to Moscow.   Reagan and Gorbachev will exchange ratification documents duringa Kremlin ceremony Wednesday morning. It is the first ratifiedsuperpower arms treaty in 16 years, the first major arms controlagreement of the Reagan administration and the only treaty to banan entire class of nuclear weapons.   The exchange ceremony substitutes for the previously hoped-forsigning of an agreement slashing by half the arsenals of strategicnuclear weapons _ the most powerful and dangerous in the superpowerarsenals.   Reagan was described Saturday by his national security adviserLt. Gen. Colin Powell as ``well rested,'' and looking forward tohis first session with the general secretary, scheduled withing anhour of the president's arrival.   Gorbachev and his wife Raisa arranged to greet their Americanguests in the Kremlin's 200-foot long St. George's Hall, a gildedand marble reception room on the second floor of the formerresidence of the Czars.   As the first ladies planned an afternoon tour of the fortress'collection of churches, apartments and bell towers, the two menwere scheduled to meet over a table in the Hall of St. Catherine atthe west end of the palace.   The U.S. Senate voted 93-5 on Friday to approve the INF treaty,signed by Reagan and Gorbachev at their Washington December summit.In a rare televised session, the Soviet Union's collectivepresidency unanimously ratified the pact 17 hours later.   A Soviet government spokesman described the action as ``a verygood prelude'' to Reagan's visit.   But in a pre-summit snag, U.S. officials revealed that chanceshad evaporated for signing an agreement on advance notification ofballistic missile tests by the superpowers. And they said twolesser arms-control measures may not be ready for signing duringReagan's talks with Gorbachev.   The agreements, while not major, would have given the leadersgrounds to boast of progress on arms control issues _ particularlyin view of the failure of the superpowers to conclude a treaty tocurb strategic nuclear weapons.   Aside from the arms agenda, officials said they did not expect``announceable progress'' on differences on human rights andregional disputes.   Asked by reporters in Washington about problems with thesecondary arms agreements, Baker said ``nothing will seriouslydetract'' from the importance of the summit meeting.   Soviet officials, meanwhile, criticized the United States forits insistence on sending U.S. aid to Afghan rebels after thewithdrawal of Red Army troops. And they hinted they might halttheir withdrawal from Afghanistan if neighboring Pakistan failed tostop aiding Afghan rebels.   The Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the Tass news agencyand the evening news show Vremya, took aim at the ``lavish suppliesof U.S. arms to Pakistan, intended specifically for theanti-government Afghan forces.''   The United States has been supplying Afghan rebels with anestimated $500 million annually in arms and other military supplieschanneled through Pakistan. It has pledged to continue to do so aslong as the Soviet Union keeps up its military support of theAfghan government.   Asked about the Soviet comments, Baker told reporters, ``Therelationship between the United States and the Soviet Union iscomplex and spans many issues. A single summit or four summits, aswe've had now, isn't going to solve them all at one time. Thegeneral relationship is better and I think prospects for generalpeace are improved.''   Gerald Ford was the last U.S. president to visit the SovietUnion, traveling to the port of Vladivostock, located on the Sea ofJapan, in 1974. Richard Nixon met the same year in Moscow with thelate Leonid Brezhnev.   Reagan, in an interview with Soviet television broadcast overthe weekend throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, said hecould not have envisioned a trip to Moscow under the Sovietleadership before Gorbachev.   ``Very frankly, I have to say I think there is a differencebetween this general secretary and other leaders of your country.... I don't think they had any dreams of perestroika'' _Gorbachev's program to restructure the nation's troubled economy.</TEXT></DOC>
