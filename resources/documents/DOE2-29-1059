The information the RNS manages consists of noteswhich are typed into the system, references to the source of the note,and subject classifications of the note. The RNS may be used to organizethe reference material (books, reprints of papers, etc.) which researcherstypically accumulate, or it may be used in a directed search for a project,or both. The Research Notes System is a set of dBASE III programs andrelational databases which meets this need. The RNS provides ease ofdata entry through the use of relational databases to minimize redundantdata entry. The information is organized by keying each note to one ormore user-defined subjects. The RNS also provides several retrieval methodsfor use during intermediate research phases and in the final-articlewriting phase. The RNS provides an update function so that a Master RNSmay be maintained with multiple users of RNS copies. This document detailsthe procedures necessary to use the RNS. Areas covered include benefits,input data dictionaries, and tips on using the RNS, as well as detailedoperating instructions. The operating instructions describe each operatingstep and each option with complete illustrations of the screen promptsand displays. The installation section describes how to use the systemon a hard disk (the recommended hardware for the system) and on floppydisks.</TEXT></DOC>
