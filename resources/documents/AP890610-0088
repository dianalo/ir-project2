(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A high-tech navigation satellitedesigned to tell U.S. and allied military forces where they arewithin 50 feet anywhere on the globe _ on land, sea or in the air _rocketed into orbit Saturday.   The three-stage Delta 2 rocket finally made it on the sixthlaunch attempt. Bad weather wiped out four tries, and the fifth wasaborted at the last second when an engine valve failed to open. Thevalve was replaced.   The Delta 2 blasted off its launch pad right on schedule at 6:30p.m. and left a fiery trail in a clear sky as it darted over theAtlantic Ocean.   The Air Force reported that the 12-story-tall rocket hadperformed flawlessly in launching the Navstar satellite into aninitial elliptical orbit ranging from about 100 to 11,000 milesabove the Earth.   ``We had normal spacecraft separation. Everything appears to havegone extremely well with today's launch,'' said Lt. Col. Ron Rand,the Air Force launch commentator.   On Tuesday, an on-board motor is to fire to shift the satelliteinto a circular orbit about 11,000 miles up.   The $30 million rocket carried a $65 million Navstar GlobalPositioning System satellite, which could enable military units suchas ships, planes, submarines and tanks to determine their locationwithin 50 feet and in some cases to within 10 feet.   Guided by the satellite, a submarine could unleash a nuclearmissile to strike within a few dozen feet of its target. A stealthbomber could sneak up on its mark without turning on tell-tale radioor radar.   The satellite, effective in any kind of weather, also wasexpected to keep track of military units' speed within a fraction ofa mile per hour and the precise time within a millionth of a second.   American and allied military users would receive information froma coded channel. Civilian users, also with access to the satellitesystem, would monitor an open channel providing them with a positionaccuracy of 300 feet.   The 3,675-pound Navstar GPS contains an atomic clock with anerror rate of one second every 300,000 years.   The satellite is the second of 21 upgraded Navstars that the AirForce plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992, givinganyone anywhere in the world 24-hour access to the positioninginformation.   The first advanced Navstar was launched aboard the maiden flightof the Delta 2 on Feb. 14.   Seven earlier-model Navstar satellites are orbiting the Earth.The new model has more power and improved systems and has added thecoded military channel.</TEXT></DOC>
