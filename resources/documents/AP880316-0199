The Commerce Department said the increase pushed construction ofsingle-family homes and apartments up to a seasonally adjustedannual rate of 1.49 million units last month following declines of15.8 percent in December and 1.9 percent in January.   Those back-to-back setbacks, coupled with three consecutivemonthly declines in new home sales, had raised concerns becausehousing is often the first industry to weaken at the onset of a newrecession. Economists feared that potential home buyers had grownwary following the record collapse of the stock market in October.   But the February upturn in construction starts was seen as anencouraging sign that while housing activity will be slower thisyear, it will not weaken so much that it threatens overall economicgrowth.   ``Housing is on the rebound,'' said Warren Lasko, executive vicepresident of the Mortgage Bankers Association. ``With interestrates at low levels and the economy growing and no recession insight, we think we have all the ingredients in place to generate astrong spring building season.''   In another upbeat report, the Federal Reserve said that outputat the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.2 percent inFebruary, leaving industrial activity 5.8 percent higher than itwas a year ago.   Analysts said the increase, although much slower than the gainsmade at the end of last year, confirmed their belief that themanufacturing sector, aided by strong export demand, would providemuch of the strength in the economy this year.   ``The industrial production figures depict an economy that isgrowing less rapidly but really looks pretty healthy,'' said JerryJasinowski, chief economist of the National Association ofManufacturers.   The declines in housing starts in December and January hadpushed building activity to its lowest point since the end of thelast recession in December 1982. Even with the February increase,the pace of building is still 17.4 percent below where it was ayear ago.   However, economists predicted that construction activity wouldclimb even more in future months as sales bounce back in responseto lower mortgage rates.   Fixed-rate mortgages, which have risen slightly in recent weeks,are still below 10 percent, standing at 9.96 percent, according toa nationwide survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.   Many economists predicted that rates would probably hold at thislevel, given the modest growth expected for the economy this year.   ``I think we have seen the lowest rates for mortgages but Idon't believe they will rise much from where they are now,'' saidJames Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of SavingsAssociations.   The 8.9 percent rise in housing starts in February was thesharpest monthly gain since a 12.7 percent rise in December 1986.   Housing permits, considered a good sign of future economicactivity, also rose sharply in February, jumping 11.5 percent to anannual rate of 1.40 million units, also the biggest monthly gainsince December 1986.   The strength in construction starts last month came in both thesingle-family and apartment sectors.   Construction of single-family homes rose 9.3 percent in Februaryto a seasonally adjusted 1.10 million units while multi-familyunits rose by 7.8 percent to an annual rate of 399,000 units.   David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association ofHome Builders, said that the improvement in construction inFebruary put housing on track with his forecasts for constructionof about 1.49 million units this year, a drop of about 8 percentfrom the number of units built in 1987.   ``We are not looking for 1988 to be a wonderful year but we arecautiously optimistic that we can get through the year withoutfurther declines,'' Seiders said.   The strength was widespread in all sections of the countryexcept the West, where starts fell 9 percent. Housing starts rose25.6 percent in the South, 13.8 percent in the Midwest and 2.7percent in the Northeast.   The report on industrial production said that the 0.2 percentFebruary increase was the fifth in a row but the weakest advancesince output fell 0.2 percent in September.   February production was held back by a further drop in activityat auto plants, where manufacturers have been scaling back plans inan effort to reduce a huge backlog of unsold cars.   Production in manufacturing rose 0.2 percent while output in themining industry was down a sharp 0.8 percent, reflecting cutbacksin coal production. Output at the nation's utilities rose 0.7percent.</TEXT></DOC>
