Schlender and David StippStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MSFT LOTSEARNINGS (ERN)COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   The race between Lotus Development Corp. and Microsoft Corp. to be the largest seller of personal-computer software remained nip and tuck as Lotus -- whose third-quarter results were propelled by surprisingly strong spreadsheet sales -- stayed close at its rival's heels.    Cambridge, Mass.-based Lotus, which relinquished the lead to Microsoft six months ago, reported that net income for the quarter ended Oct. 3 more than doubled to $19.1 million, or 42 cents a share, from $9.5 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 54% to $101.2 million from $65.6 million.    Microsoft matched Lotus's 54% growth rate in sales, ringing up $102.6 million in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $66.8 million last year.    Microsoft's profit growth lagged Lotus's somewhat however, as the Redmond, Wash.-based company posted a 34% rise in net income to $21.3 million, or 38 cents a share, compared with $15.8 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. Per-share figures for the 1986 figures have been restated to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split paid last month.    &quot;Lotus exceeded our expectations for the quarter more than Microsoft did,&quot; said Bruce Johnston, a software industry analyst for First Boston Corp. &quot;What that means is that any hiatus in buying (Lotus's) 1-2-3 spreadsheet is over, and corporate customers are coming back with a vengeance.&quot;    Jim P. Manzi, Lotus's president and chief executive officer, said the company's third quarter revenue included record sales of 1-2-3, its mainstay product. Sales of the company's Symphony program were the strongest since its 1984 introduction, and sales of the Japanese version of 1-2-3 also were up for the third consecutive quarter, Mr. Manzi said.    Richard Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. said unit sales of 1-2-3 were up more than 30% in the third quarter, after rising a little more than 20% in the first half. &quot;The third quarter is usually a seasonally slow quarter for software sales, so 1-2-3 is doing very, very well,&quot; he said. Lotus 1-2-3 program contributes about 63% of the company's sales, he added.    Sales of Lotus graphics software, which account for about 4% of the company's revenue, also were &quot;four to five times&quot; higher in the third quarter than they were a year earlier, Mr. Sherlund said.    According to Frank Gaudette, Microsoft's vice president and chief financial officer, the company's growth reflected &quot;basically our fundamental business&quot; rather than growth resulting from Microsoft's flurry of new product announcements in recent weeks.    In the past month, Microsoft unveiled a new version of its Works program, a competitor to Lotus's Symphony; a new version of its word-processing program for International Business Machines Corp. and IBM-compatible machines; a new version of its Windows program for high-performance personal computers; and a version of its Excel spreadsheet for IBM-compatible machines that will compete head-on with 1-2-3. Of those products, however, only the Word program was shipped during the quarter.    The rest of those products will be shipped in Microsoft's second quarter, which will create &quot;a certain spike effect&quot; in financial results for that period, Mr. Gaudette said.    In national over-the-counter trading, Lotus's stock plunged yesterday, as did most other issues, and closed yesterday at $26.25 a share, down $6. Microsoft shares closed at $45.25 each, down $19.50, also in national over-the-counter trading.    Mr. Gaudette said Microsoft benefited from the fact that &quot;underlying sales of PCs have been much higher than anybody had anticipated.&quot; That helps Microsoft in particular, because it sells operating system software that is necessary for many of those machines to function. But Microsoft's sales of applications software -- such as spreadsheets and word processors -- and computer-languages &quot;have remained in excess of 60% of our business,&quot; he added. Sales of Microsoft's applications programs for the Apple Computer Inc. Macintosh personal computer are especially strong, analysts say.    Mr. Sherlund of Goldman Sachs attributed the continuing strong sales of personal computer software to &quot;the whole trend of hardware downsizing, which is driving up demand for minicomputers and personal computers while mainframe sales languish.&quot;    For the first nine months, Lotus's net rose 50% to $49.1 million, or $1.08 a share, from $32.7 million, or 69 cents a share, from a year earlier. Sales rose 39% to $280 million from $201 million.    (Revised WSJ Oct. 21, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
