RSA Data Security Inc.'s approach is already widely usedin Europe. In the U.S., a number of companies, includingNovell Inc., Lotus Development Corp. and Digital EquipmentCorp., have licensed the technology for use in theirproducts. A Pentagon logistics agency and InterNet, thenation's premier computer network for researchers, also usethe technology. And now, based on the premise that privateindustry won't adopt a computer-security standard untilgovernment does, the U.S. is considering endorsing RSA Data'sapproach. If that happens, computer companies will have agreater incentive to invest in the technology.</LP><TEXT>   But according to government officials, the NationalSecurity Agency -- the government's largest intelligenceagency and most skilled code breaker -- is objecting to thechoice of RSA Data's technology and is generally reluctant tomove forward on any standard in the field known as public-keycryptography. The probable reason, the officials say: The RSAsystem is too effective. The snoopers blocked by the systemcould include the NSA itself.   Some see the RSA case as a classic example of domesticcompanies being deprived of ready access to a valuableproduct by national security interests. &quot;The unintendedeffect is that the most interesting cryptographic research isgoing on outside of the U.S.,&quot; says John Gilmore, a computerconsultant in San Francisco. Adds Martin Hellman, a StanfordUniversity professor: &quot;NSA has a vested interest in notgetting all the knowledge (about security) applied.&quot;   The NSA won't comment on its role, but there's no doubtthat not adopting a standard is costly. Hackers appear tohave little trouble penetrating many computer networks,sometimes leaving damaging computer viruses. Users of suchnetworks have no ironclad way of knowing who sent themmessages, making it nearly impossible to safely transmitlegal documents, such as contracts. Moreover, the failure ofU.S. computer makers to offer more stringent securityfeatures seems likely to hamper their sales in foreigncountries, where RSA Data's technique is becoming widespread.   &quot;There's an economic price to be paid for the inability toresolve this conflict,&quot; says New Jersey Democrat Robert G.Torricelli, chairman of a House subcommittee that will hold ahearing tomorrow on computer security. &quot;We are accomplishingnothing but losing a foreign market.&quot;   RSA Data's products are generally praised by securityexperts because they are an advance over traditional&quot;one-way&quot; encryption. Each user has a secret key, or code,and a public key published in a directory, and both keys areproduced -- and linked -- by a mathematical formula. Sendersuse the addressee's public key to route their messages, andrecipients use their secret key for deciphering. Moreover,the messages bear &quot;digital signatures,&quot; imprinted with thesender's secret key, which provide proof of the sender'sidentity.   RSA Data was founded by three Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology professors who invented the approach in 1977.Because a description of the company's chief invention wasfirst published in an academic journal, RSA Data's mostimportant patent isn't enforceable outside the U.S. Thecompany's revenue, which is less than $5 million annually,has also been limited by customer unwillingness to spendmoney on security and periodic questions about whether RSAData's codes can be cracked.   But many security experts say RSA Data's solution issuperior to any of the alternatives. &quot;From a technologyperspective, there really isn't an alternative,&quot; says RobertSchleelein, Digital's manager of strategic relations.   It is unusual for the government to endorse a standardthat requires royalty payments. But such a move may bejustified in this case because &quot;RSA is close to being a defacto standard,&quot; says Dennis Branstad, a computer scientistat the National Institute of Standards and Technology, theCommerce Department agency that creates technical standards.   An NSA spokeswoman denies the agency harbors any ill willtoward the company. In fact, some experts believe the NSAuses RSA Data's technology itself, and the spokeswoman saysthat &quot;NSA would never go out and say we don't like RSA'sproducts.&quot;   But James Bidzos, RSA Data's chief executive, isn't sosure. He says that in 1982 the Commerce Department beganconsidering RSA Data's technology as the basis for a standardfor public-key cryptography. RSA Data was asked to submittechnical information and did so, but it never heard anythingfrom the department.   The NSA was behind the government's sudden loss ofinterest in RSA Data, says a Commerce Department official whoconfirms Mr. Bidzos's story. &quot;The project was put on the backburner&quot; because it was &quot;unclear who was really responsiblefor developing standards -- the NSA or us,&quot; the officialsays.   The NSA has long influenced the civilian use of electronicsecurity measures, partly by intense political lobbying andpartly through federal limits on the export of cryptographicproducts. In 1987, a report by the Office of TechnologyAssessment criticized the NSA's sway over civilian uses ofcryptography, saying the agency's actions had been&quot;inconsistent,&quot; and raised questions about &quot;the boundarybetween civilian and military authorities.&quot;   Seeking to shift some control of computer security,including cryptography, back to civilians, Congress severalyears ago approved a law giving the Commerce Department'sInstitute of Standards and Technology the power to setcommercial, non-military standards in the area. Last year,Rep. Torricelli's subcommittee told the institute to developa standard for public-key cryptography but allowed the NSA tohelp.   More than a year later, the two agencies still haven'tproduced a draft standard. The NSA spokeswoman says theagency is &quot;cooperating&quot; with the institute, but Rep.Torricelli thinks the two are deadlocked. &quot;There areconflicting interests between a perceived need to allowintelligence agencies to operate freely and (providing)sufficient protection for our private businesses,&quot; he says.   Complicating matters further, the institute seemsill-equipped to handle the task of forging a new standard,which is likely to consist of a series of highly technicalproposals. Even the institute's Mr. Branstad concedes thatthe department's work has been hampered by a severelyrestricted budget.   The obstacles to progress have made some of theinstitute's advisers in private industry despair that afederal standard will ever emerge. But even without one,industry executives believe that RSA Data's products willcatch on as customers become more security conscious.   Novell, for instance, adopted RSA Data's approach lastmonth. It made its move, says Richard King, vice president ofsoftware development, because &quot;if you wait around for thesecommittees to make a decision, you'll go out of business.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
