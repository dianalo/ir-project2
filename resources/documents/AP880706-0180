The bank's study, ``World Development Report 1988'' predictedthat if the United States and other leading governments follow whatthe bank sees as the right policies, the average income of theircitizens will grow by 2.6 percent a year between 1987 and 1995.   The right policies, it said, included ``credible action'' toreduce the U.S. federal budget deficit and creation of more demandfor goods in Japan, West Germany and industrializing countries suchas South Korea and Taiwan.   It gave the average U.S. income for 1986 as $17,480, for Japanas $12,840 and for a poor African country like Tanzania, $250.   But it calculated that countries in sub-Saharan Africa will seetheir incomes grow by only 0.7 percent annually.   ``In some developing countries the prolonged economic slump isalready more severe than it was during the Great Depression (of the1930s) in the industrial countries,'' the report said. ``The tideof poverty and misery in those countries is rising, not receding.''   The World Bank, which is owned by 151 countries, tries to raiseliving standards in the poor ones by providing loans on easy terms.It lends about $17 billion a year and wants to increase that by 10percent annually. The ambition could be hampered by reluctance inCongress to contribute to an increase of the bank's capital.   The report said much must be done to reverse the way things aregoing in the poorer countries.   ``Since 1980 matters have turned from bad to worse,'' it said.In most Third World countries, growth has slowed, wages havedropped, job creation has faltered, and farm prices and governmentspending on social services both have declined.   ``The number of people below the poverty line increased at leastup to 1983-4 in Brazil, Chile, Ghana, Jamaica, Peru and thePhilippines ...,'' the report added.   ``There has been a sharp reversal in the trend toward improvedstandards of child health, nutrition and education ... In 21 out of35 low-income developing countries, the daily calorie supply ...was lower in 1985 than in 1965. Between 1979 and 1982 lifeexpectancy declined in nine sub-Saharan countries. In Zimbabwedeaths from malnutrition among infants and children doubled during1980-4 ....''   Bank officials saw improvement in the poor countries asdepending heavily on what happens in the rich ones.   The report predicted that if the policies it recommends are notfollowed, incomes in the industrial countries will grow by only 1.8percent a year between 1987 and 1995 _ slightly less than earlierin the decade. In that case it saw Third World incomes growing at2.2 percent and not at all in Africa below the Sahara.   Growth traditionally is more rapid in developing countries thanin the industrialized ones.   The report blamed military spending for worsening the situation.   ``Evidence increasingly points to high military spending ascontributing to fiscal and debt crises, complicating stabilizationand adjustment, and negatively affecting economic growth anddevelopment,'' it said.   ``Whatever benefits might arise from such spending must becarefully weighed against these heavy costs.''</TEXT></DOC>
