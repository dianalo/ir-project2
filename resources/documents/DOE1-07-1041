The LUEh-300 specific feature consists in the fact, thateach of its four sections, including the bunching one, possesses feedbackrings, providing for the high-frequency energy recuperation. Resultsof investigations into self-oscillating acceleration mode show, thatapplication of high-frequency energy recuperation in linacs allows oneto produce relativistic beams with the modulated density profile in separatedcurrent pulses.</TEXT></DOC>
