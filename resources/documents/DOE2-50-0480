<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-50-0480 </DOCNO><TEXT>An extrudable glass fiber-reinforced polyvinyl chloride composition usedfor the production of extruded articles is made up of polyvinyl chlorideresin, glass fibers, inorganic fillers different from the glass fibers,and conventional additives, including mold release agents, stabilizers,processing aids, and colorants. The composition contains, per 100 partsby weight of a polyvinyl chloride resin, 50-100 parts by weight of glassfibers having a diameter of below 50{mu}m with a length up to 12 mm,and 5-25 parts by weight of a mineral filler having an average particlediameter of below 50 {mu}m and exhibiting a modulus of elasticity inthe extrusion direction of an extruded product of at least 8,000 N/mm/sup2/ at 23/sup 0/C. The invention also includes a profile strip for themanufacture of frames for windows or doors comprising a core profileformed of the above composition and a synthetic resin shell surroundingat least a part of the core profile.</TEXT></DOC>
