Law-enforcement officials said that top Justice Department officials are reviewing recommendations from prosecutors to seek conspiracy charges against the Hazeltine Corp. subsidiary of St. Louis-based Emerson and the defense electronics unit of Los Angeles-based Teledyne.    They added that the U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va., Henry Hudson, who is directing the grand jury inquiry, also wants to seek charges against several former or current executives of the two concerns.    One law-enforcement official and others familiar with the inquiry said that if the grand jury, which is scheduled to meet today and tomorrow, isn't asked to return criminal charges this week, such action is likely to come in early December.    Hazeltine has acknowledged that it is a target of the much-publicized criminal inquiry and says that it is cooperating with the prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.    A Teledyne spokesman declined to comment.    Criminal charges against Hazeltine and the Teledyne unit would be the first growing out of the two-year investigation -- known as Operation Ill Wind -- into alleged bribery and influence peddling involving major Defense Department contractors, their employees and consultants.    Previously, it was reported that Mr. Hudson's staff had notified lawyers for two defense consultants -- William Parkin and Fred Lackner -- that indictments would be sought against their clients unless they agreed to plead guilty to bribery-related charges and cooperate with the government. Mr. Parkin worked as a consultant for Hazeltine and the Teledyne unit and shared his fees with Mr. Lackner.    Officials and others disclosed in the last few days that prosecutors also are considering charges against Stuart Berlin, a top Navy engineer and close friend of Mr. Lackner, in the conspiracy and bribery case. Investigators are looking into whether Mr. Lackner paid Mr. Berlin for providing him with inside information or steering business to Mr. Lackner's clients.    Messrs. Lackner and Parkin have denied bribing anyone, and Mr. Berlin repeatedly has declined comment.    Several persons familiar with the investigation said in the last few days that prosecutors are reviewing the activities of at least six current or former Teledyne executives, including Robert Hougardy, the president of the electronics unit; Layne Clark, a senior executive of the unit; and Michael Savaides, a former Washington marketing representative for the unit. The investigation also is reviewing the activities of Joseph Colarusso, executive vice president of Hazeltine, and Charles Furciniti, a former vice president of Hazeltine's Washington office.    Attorneys for all of the men declined to comment.    Two law-enforcement officials said that Mr. Hudson, the prosecutor, has handed Justice Department officials papers seeking approval for an indictment accusing Hazeltine, the Teledyne electronics unit, some officials of both entities, and Messrs. Parkin, Lackner and Berlin of engaging in a single, broad conspiracy.    These law-enforcement officials said prosecutors hope to show that Mr. Parkin and Mr. Lackner arranged to pay Mr. Berlin for information, which they passed on to Hazeltine and Teledyne. Some defense lawyers privately criticize the strategy of tying together Hazeltine and Teledyne in a single conspiracy, since they don't appear to have had any connection other than their use of Mr. Parkin as a consultant.    One defense lawyer called the single conspiracy theory an &quot;unorthodox approach,&quot; while another described it as &quot;startling.&quot;    Law-enforcement officials said, however, that Hazeltine and Teledyne may instead be named in separate conspiracies involving Messrs. Parkin, Lackner and Berlin. They also said that plea negotiations are continuing with some targets, and stressed that it wasn't clear how many officials or former officials of the defense contractors would be charged.    Officials said that by seeking charges against the two prominent contractors and some senior executives, Mr. Hudson hopes to allay criticism that his investigation, which involved many wiretaps and became public amid great fanfare last summer, has failed to live up to expectations. Prosecutors also hope to prod other companies and executives into cooperating.    Several people said that the Hazeltine inquiry concerns assistance Mr. Parkin gave the company on a still-pending Navy contract for anti-aircraft equipment. Mr. Parkin has acknowledged paying Mr. Lackner more than $15,000 in return for secret data on the Navy's plans and requirements. He said he concluded that Mr. Lackner got the information from Mr. Berlin, the Navy engineer.    Mr. Parkin charged the Teledyne electronics unit for assistance on an Air Force contract. He said he divided $18,000 from Teledyne evenly with Mr. Lackner and another associate. </TEXT></DOC>
