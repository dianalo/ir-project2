The 15, including former Interior Minister Jose Abrantes andformer major general and war hero Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, werestripped of their rank and expelled from the Communist Party lastweek.   They were formally indicted by the military court in a meetinglate Friday and early Saturday, said the official Prensa Latina newsagency, monitored in Mexico City.   If convicted, the 15 could face the firing squad.   The news agency said the court reconvened Saturday afternoon. Itsaid the proceedings were attended by the Cuban press and seniorgovernment officials but gave no details.   Dispatches from Havana said the defendants belonged to a secretdivision of the Interior Ministry that smuggled medicines, hospitalsupplies and computers to circumvent a U.S. trade embargo.   Prensa Latina said the military prosecutor, Brig. Gen. JuanEscalona Reguera, told the court they conspired for 2{ years to helpColombia's Medellin cartel smuggle cocaine into the United Statesand also dealt in diamonds and ivory.   Escalona dismissed as ``absurd'' arguments by Ochoa and some ofthe other accused that they dealt in cocaine to earn dollars to helpCuba's faltering economy, Prensa Latina said.   The accused made these claims before a separate military tribunalon Tuesday and Wednesday that stripped them of all rank anddecorations and recommended a court-martial.   Escalona was quoted as saying the 15 tried to damage ``theprestige of the Cuban Revolution and sully the image of the officersof the armed forces and those of the Interior Ministry.''   Escalona called drug trafficking ``an inhuman and criminal''enterprise.   ``The trial is being carried out with all procedural guaranteesestablished by Cuban legislation and they (the accused) arerepresented by their corresponding defense counsels,'' Prensa Latinasaid.   The court was made up of three major generals.   Ochoa, who was a much decorated war hero, took part or directedfighting in Angola and Ethiopia and served on missions in Venezuelaand to help Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista regime.   President Fidel Castro on Thursday replaced Maj. Gen. Abranteswith Maj. Gen. Abelardo Colome Ibarra, a confidant of Castro and thethird-highest ranking officer after Castro and Defense Minister RaulCastro, the president's brother.   The Communist Party has also expelled Diocles Torralba, a formervice president and transportation minister for ``serious violationsof ethical, political and administrative principles.''   Torralba, who was fired by Castro as minister of transportationlast week, was under arrest along with several others accused ofcorruption, the Mexican government news agency Notimex said.
