First, the plant's popularity with American children haswaned. And it got bad publicity in the film &quot;Little Shop ofHorrors.&quot; Now thousands of them are being filched from thefew remaining spots where they grow.</LP><TEXT>   Officials in North Carolina say the flytrap, the plantwith the bristled leaves that clamp shut on bugs, is in afight for survival. Developers and industry have crowded thecarnivore out of many of the wetlands where it once grew (inthe wild, it's now found in only 11 counties in theCarolinas). The shrinking habitat and continuing demandoverseas have made the plant a poachers' favorite.   &quot;Whole savannas where flytraps were abundant have beencleaned out,&quot; says Cecil Frost, coordinator of the NorthCarolina Plant Conservation Program.   The poaching problem has become so severe that, effectiveJune 1, the state's Plant Conservation Board stiffened thepenalties for picking flytraps. Fines can run $100 to $500per plant for a first offense and as much as $1,000 for asecond offense.   Undaunted, more than 25 poachers are making a living bydigging up flytraps in the 50,000-acre Holly Shelter gamelands, estimates Herman Strickland, a state wildlife officer.&quot;As hot as it is, they'll walk eight to 10 miles to dig thesethings,&quot; says Mr. Strickland. &quot;They're taking the chance ofticks, parasites and snakes. We know good well they're makingmoney to go to that trouble.&quot; The state estimates that apoacher can make more than $200 a day harvesting flytraps.   Despite the run on wild flytraps, U.S. demand for them haswaned, according to the largest flytrap grower, JamesNorthrop of Northrop's Insectivorous Plant Farm in Hampstead,N.C. &quot;Twenty-five years ago every kid had a Venus' flytrap,&quot;he laments. &quot;Now they don't.&quot;   But there are still buyers abroad. Lorenzo Marshall, anursery owner in Harrison Creek, N.C., sells 75% of hisflytraps to Holland, Japan and Germany. Most go to a Germanpharmaceutical company that extracts a flytrap enzyme for adrug used in cancer and AIDS cases. With stiffer finesscaring away some illegal competition, Mr. Marshall gainedfive international customers in recent months.   The plants definitely have their local fans. &quot;I'd love tohave a whole lot more around,&quot; says Milton McLean, anotherwildlife officer. &quot;They eat ticks.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
