<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-87-0144 </DOCNO><TEXT>The magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium, local stability, and transport propertiesof a spatial axis stellarator with circular cross-section are calculatedby using a three-dimensional MHD code (BETA code). The equilibrium resultsare compared with analytic expressions given by Solov'ev and Shafranovto examine the applicability of the theory. Agreement is found with respectto the equilibrium properties, such as rotational transform, shift ofmagnetic axis due to finite pressure, and formation of a magnetic well.The toroidal effects on both curvature and torsion of the spatial magneticaxis must be estimated with sufficient accuracy so as to obtain agreement.(author). 12 refs, 7 figs, 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
