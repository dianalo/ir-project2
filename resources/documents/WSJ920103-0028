The companies, in a joint statement, said the researchprogram will focus on the development of new pharmaceuticalsthat are expected to act on genes to regulate the productionof cellular proteins. The drugs would be small molecules thatcould be taken orally, as opposed to most drugs developedthrough biotechnology, which must be injected.</LP><TEXT>   The move is part of a trend among big drug firms, AmericanHome in particular, to expand in biotechnology throughalliances with smaller research firms, in an effort to builda stream of future products. But for this kind of genetictherapy, the two companies noted that research is still at avery early stage: given the cutting-edge nature of thetechnology and current typical lead times in the industry fordeveloping major drugs, any products resulting from theventure likely wouldn't emerge for years.   Nevertheless, investors were willing to bet on Oncogene.Its shares jumped $1.9375 to $9.0625 in nationalover-the-counter trading yesterday. The Uniondale, N.Y.,company already has similar venture agreements with PfizerInc. to develop gene-based drugs to treat cancer. LastOctober, it made a public offering of 3.2 million shares at$5.50 each; its first public offering was in 1986.   Meanwhile, American Home's shares fell 37.5 cents to$84.25 in late New York Stock Exchange trading.   Under the accord, the Wyeth-Ayerst division of AmericanHome will have the rights to manufacture and market worldwidethe drugs resulting from the program. Oncogene will receiveroyalty payments based on product sales.   Oncogene's research involves developing drugs that act onproteins involved in the underlying causes of the diseases,rather than merely treating symptoms. Such drugs would eitherinhibit or increase production of the proteins, depending onwhether the disease involves a deficiency or overproductionof the protein.   The companies couldn't specifically forecast how much theyexpected to spend on development of such drugs. But Gary E.Frashier, president and chief executive officer of OncogeneScience, said the cost of development of a major druggenerally is &quot;well over $200 million.&quot; He said the agreementwith American Home Products calls for it to fund all researchand the costs of clinical trials. He said the trial phasecould begin in three to five years.   John R. Stafford, chairman and chief executive of AmericanHome Products, said, &quot;This is another step in American HomeProducts' plans to build its Randamp;D capability via biotechnologyagreements, alliances and its own internal resources.&quot;   Although such drugs are far off, they have great revenuepotential. A spokeswoman for the Wyeth-Ayerst division saidthere are about six million diagnosed diabetics in the U.S.and another six million that haven't been diagnosed, 10million to 20 million bronchial asthma sufferers and about 24million sufferers of osteoporosis. And Larry Smith, abiotechnology analyst at Hambrecht andamp; Quist, said the drugscould command relatively high prices &quot;because of the specificvalue of their therapy&quot; in controlling the root causes ofillnesses.   In its third quarter, Oncogene had a narrower loss of$695,000, or seven cents a share, on revenue of $2.2 million.As with many other emerging biotechnology companies, it hasrelatively little revenue but a climbing market valuation asinvestors bet on future products from its research. Atyesterday's close, its nearly 14.9 million shares outstandinghad a total value of more than $140 million.</TEXT></DOC>
