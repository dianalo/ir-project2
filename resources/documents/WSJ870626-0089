Traditionally, savings and loans experience increased withdrawals in April because of income-tax payments. However, federal thrift regulators have said that withdrawals began rising in Texas in mid-March as customers grew uneasy with the deteriorating condition of some Sandamp;Ls. Yesterday, the Dallas Federal Home Loan Bank declined to comment on the April withdrawal statistics.    The accelerating withdrawals underscore the problems faced by the state's weakest thrifts. As loan losses mount, and some large Texas thrifts have failed, some large and small depositors are pulling out their deposits.    As previously reported, that situation is causing several Texas thrifts that are desperate for cash to bid up the interest rates they pay for funds. The weakest thrifts are paying for some deposits rates as much as 2.25 percentage points over those offered by out-of-state Sandamp;Ls.    The higher interest costs are also pushing many Texas thrifts into the red. The Dallas Federal Home Loan Bank reported that 280 Texas thrifts rolled up a total net loss of $424.4 million in April, compared with a $100.6 million net loss in the year-earlier month and a $303.8 million net loss in March of this year.    What's more, several Texas institutions are borrowing heavily from the Dallas Federal Home Loan Bank. Yesterday, the Dallas federal bank reported that its total loans to Texas thrifts in April jumped 13.1% to $18.5 billion from $16.2 billion in March. These loans cover various needs by Sandamp;Ls, including cash needed to meet withdrawals.    Included in the Dallas federal bank's borrowings are $9.3 billion in advances, up 11.7% from $8.3 billion in advances made in March.    The Dallas federal bank declined to comment on the withdrawals.    However, as previously reported, the bank is holding talks with several major Wall Street brokerages, including Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., to enlist their participation in a program that would allow them to continue to place large deposits in some big, insolvent Texas thrifts and to make a secondary market in these certificates of deposit.    The program would allow that if a thrift should fail, some funds would cover uninsured amounts above the $100,000 insured-deposit level, and it would ensure that depositors continue to earn interest rates originally set by the thrift for the full term of the deposit. When some thrifts have been taken over or closed, institutions taking over the deposits have reduced interest rates, angering customers and Wall Street securities firms. </TEXT></DOC>
