(program)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Here's the Kit Hyped to the extreme, talked about for seemingly an aeon,Windows 3 struggled into the world in April this year.andP;  Naturally, us poorprogrammers had to wait until August before we were officially allowed toprogram the said environment.andP;  ('Officially' because anybody and their catmanaged to get hold of a beta copy of the Software Development Kit [SDK],which you need to get going.andP;  Some trusting companies, such as Samna, evenmanaged to sell shrink-wrapped software made from these beta tools.)andP;  Thequestion is, was it worth the wait?andM;Out of the boxandM;One thing is immediately clear upon unpacking the software.andP;  The systemrequirements for the toolkit have jumped to ridiculous proportions.andO;Microsoft states that in addition to the normal Windows configuration youneed:andM;* 286/386/486 system with 384 KB of extended memory,andM;* secondary monochrome monitor and adapter card or a twin 8514/VGAcombination (the former being cheaper and more useful for testing),andM;* Microsoft Mouse (or compatible),andM;* Microsoft C 5.1 or 6.0 or Microsoft MASM (actually, you just need a Windowscompatible compiler such as TopSpeed Modula-2 or Zortech C++),andM;* A hard disk with 5.5 MB free for the SDK.andM;In my experience of the toolkit, you actually should have, in addition:andM;* Microsoft Word (either for Windows, MSDOS or Macintosh) or a word processorcapable of producing Rich Text Format (RTF) for making help text.andM;* Microsoft MASM or Borland's TASM V2.0 for making DLLs and compiling theexamples,andM;* a 386 or 486 computer, for speed and the ability to use all three Windowsmemory modes plus EMS/non-EMS,andM;* a fast hard disk with at least 15 MB free space (my setup had about 25 MBtaken by the Windows development system, plus a 10 MB Windows swap file),andM;* at least 2 MB of RAM, (going on 4 MB for comfort),andM;* a serial terminal if you want to run the advanced protected mode debugger.andM;The Windows 3 SDK consists of a set of utilities, some C and MASM headerfiles and libraries, plus the documentation.andP;  The tools fall into threecategories: resource editors (such as a dialog box editor), debuggers andoptimisation tools, and a Windows help compiler.andP;  The INSTALL program copiesthe stuff over, makes one or more replacement C run-time libraries, sets up adebugging version of Windows and adds an SDK Tools group to the ProgramManager Window.andM;The files on the SDK disks (as with Windows 3 itself) are compressed, so youare almost forced to use the INSTALL program.andP;  Luckily, it is similar to thetext part of the Windows 3 SETIP program, and just as slick.andP;  You are quicklyled through questions such as: In which directories do you want to place theSDK?, Which memory models do you wish to use? and Do you want the samplesource code?andP;  At the end of installation, you are deposited at the DOSprompt.andP;  Unfortunately, if you start Windows at this point, you can't doubleclick on any of the SDK Tools in the Program Manager as the SDK tools aren'tyet in the path...andM;Resource EditorsandM;A Windows Program consists of a (usually) C code part, compiled and linked inthe normal fashion, plus some 'resources', compiled by the special resourcecompiler, and attached to the end of the EXE file.andP;  A resource can be anystring, menu, dialog box, font, icon, mouse cursor or bitmap associated withthe file.andP;  The SDK contains an MS-DOS based resource compiler and threeWindows-based tools: SDKPAINT for icons, cursor and bitmaps, DIALOG fordialog boxes and PONTEDIT for fonts.andP;  All of the Windows tools require amouse - if you don't have one they politely request you visit your localcomputer store and exit.andM;Input to the resource compiler takes the form of a resource script (.RCfile)-an ASCII file.andP;  This script file controls inclusion and use of otherresources, while also defining the strings, menus and accelerators.andP;  Resourcescripts have a simple format (unless generated automatically by DIALOG).andP;  Forexample, a quiche making program might have a resource file like that inFigure 2.andP;  The # include directive is just the same as C's.andP;  The fileQUICHE.H, with # defined constants ID_ONION and ID_MUSHROOM, is shared by theresource script and the C program - the constants are the numbers theprogrammer uses to determine the menu item.andP;  The QUICHECURSOR defines acursor made by SDKPAINT in the file QUICHE.CUR.andP;  The QUICHEICON likewisedefines an icon in the file QUICHE.ICO.andP;  The menu has a heading 'Flavours',and three items in the pull down section.andP;  The 'andamp;' character in the textstrings represents the ALT or F10 key used to activate the menu.andP;  Forexample, the key sequence 'F10 F M' will deliver a Mushroom flavoured quicheto your table.andM;Because the resource compiler must be involved in the creation of everysingle Windows program, it is used to perform some special marking functions.andO;The most important of these is the marking of an application as Windows 3compatible.andP;  This prevents that annoying box appearing each time you run anunmarked (= Windows 2) application under Windows 3.andM;SDKPAINT (see Figure 1.andP;  The picture is not quite right, owing to the latediscovery of the incompatibility of our screen capture program with Windows 3- Ed) uses the analogy of a paint program to make the icons, bitmaps andcursors used by a Windows program.andP;  You click the left mouse button in thebitmap to set a pixel and the right button to clear it.andP;  The Color radiobutton in the dialog box undermeath the bitmap selects the colour you getwhen you press a button.andP;  The Screen radio button sets the colour thatdefines the screen background colour while Inverse sets inverse of the screencolour.andP;  The drawing tools provided allow you to fill closed areas and createthe following shapes: lines, filled/hollow circles and filled/hollowrectangles.andP;  SDKPAINT is fun to use, and I frittered away hours twiddlingwith icons and cursors.andP;  SDKPAINT did crash on me a few times, once in areproducible away, but several times not, so watch it.andP;  Another feature:sometimes you click on a colour and SDKPAINT, apparently sneering at yourpoor taste, will substitute an entirely different one.andM;FONTEDIT (Figure 2) is very similar to SDKPAINT, except that it applies tofonts.andP;  You have a different selection of drawing tools, such as rotating ablock of pixels.andP;  There are also special controls that relate to fonts suchas widths, weights, font family, character set and pitch.andP;  Most Windowsprogrammers use FONTEDIT once in a green Satum.andM;On the other hand, programmers have to use DIALOG a lot to design thosedialog boxes over which we all expend such loving care.andP;  In theory, DIALOG issimple: you draw the dialog box, choose a control from a movable toolbox ormenu, and then select its ID and attributes by double clicking on thecontrol.andP;  In my limited use, the tool caused me to swear more than any othertool.andM;Let's deal with DIALOG's user interface problems first.andP;  Ask for a new fileand dialog, you are presented with a dialog box outline too small to be ofany use.andP;  So you make it bigger, so that you can put something in it.andP;  But atthis stage you have no idea how big the outline needs to be - you will haveto resize again when finished.andP;  Why can't the border auto-size itself ascontrols are added?andP;  You then add a control by menu item or toolbox, acrosshair appears and you click at the place you want it.andP;  Trouble is, thecontrol is always the wrong size, so you must resize it-which involvesselecting the control and dragging it.andP;  If you add a control with text, thecontrol doesn't resize when your text is bigger than the currently set size.andO;This means yet another resize.andP;  If all this wasn't enough, Cut and Paste workat the dialog level, so you can't easily copy a selection of controls fromone dialog box to another.andM;DIALOG also has a number of strange anomalies.andP;  You cannot reset a dialog'sglobal settings in some circumstances.andP;  Dialogs mysteriously overlap the menubar.andP;  There is a dialog box in a non-systems font.andP;  The worst problem is thatDIALOG won't accept a header (.H) file that contains anything other #defines.andP;  Comments, or any other imperfections, are verboten I alsoexperienced various system crashes when DIALOG was running with anotherprogram such as Microsoft Word.andP;  This could be due to a number of reasons,but other people who have used DIALOG have also found it to crash from timeto time.andM;Debugging ToolsandM;The SDK comes with eight (!) debugging tools, perhaps saying something aboutthe difficulty of programming Windows in C and assembly language.andP;  Thedebugging tool with the most functionality (and most system requirements) isCode View for Windows.andP;  This is a Windows program that requires - twomonitors; the CGA/EGA/VGA/8514 one containing the normal Windows screen, themonochrome or VGA containing the familiar CodeView screen.andP;  This works verywell, since you can always see the line of code and the result at the sametime.andP;  The rest of CodeView for Windows is similar to CodeView V3.0 forMSDOS.andP;  The main enhancements are the ability to display Window's local andglobal heap, being able to track Windows messages and the use of protectedmode.andM;This last feature (termed 'standard and enhanced modes' in the Windowscontext) means that there shouldn't be any memory problems even for bigprograms.andP;  However, the debugging symbol table is loaded into memory, soyou'll need oodles of expanded memory for any decent sized program.andO;Microsoft recommend 1 Mb or more of expanded memory for programs with manysymbols.andP;  CodeView for Windows, therefore, requires more hardware than therest of the SDK.andP;  If you don't want to use it, the system requirements falldramatically.andM;The use of protected mode by CodeView for Windows means that it doesn't workinandM;real mode.andP;  Instead, you have to use Symdeb - the symbolic version of DEBUG.andO;Older readers might remember that it was shipped with Microsoft languagesbefore CodeView came into being.andP;  Unlike CodeView for Windows, you can use aserial terminal for the Symdeb screen (although it can drive a second monitorinstead).andP;  Symdeb is a rather rudimentary tool for the 1990s.andP;  You should notbe forced to use it, even in real mode.andM;CodeView for Windows and Symdeb don't allow the tracking of low-levelfeatures of protected mode such as Global, Local and Interrupt DescriptorTables (GDT, LDT and IDTs), paged memory and 8086 Virtual Machines (VMs).andO;Microsoft has thoughtfully provided the 80386 debugger - WDEB386 - to allowaccess to these things.andP;  It's simple, DEBUGish interface hides a utilitydripping with power for assembler hackers.andP;  I had great fun with it, but Itsuspect most users won't need to use it in anger.andP;  Incidentally, the 80386debugger is a misnomer - it runs happily on a 286 or 486 processor, in spiteof the documentation.andP;  Unfortunately, it only works with a serial terminaland not a second monitor.andP;  You, therefore, need two monitors and a serialterminal on your desk if you are going to use all three debugging tools.andO;Microsoft programmers must have big offices with long desks.andM;Microsoft, perhaps bitten by the reputation of Windows programs for beingslow, has provided two profiling tools.andP;  The first, PROFILER, lets you samplethe amount of time Windows spends executing pieces of code.andP;  The second,SWAP, lets you analyse the number of procedure calls across segmentboundaries.andM;PROFLIER uses the CMOS clock chip to time the application between two entrypoints, ProfStart () and ProfStop (), that you place in your code.andP;  Thesamples are recorded in a buffer which gets written to disk when Windowsterminates.andP;  You then run an MS-DOS program, Showhits, which uses the symbolfiles to give a simple report on the percentage spent in the Windows Kerneland the procedures between ProfStart () and ProfStop ().andP;  For some reason,PROFILER doesn't run in Windows Standard (286) mode.andM;Swap uses a special version of the real mode Windows Kernel that logs Windowsswapping behaviour to a file.andP;  You enable this logging process by placing aSwapRecording () call in your application.andP;  A DOS program, Swap, interpretsthe log and displays the result on the screen.andM;Microsoft provides two tools for finding problems with your use of Windowsmemory management: Shaker and HeapWalker.andP;  Shaker randomly allocates andfrees chunks of global memory for you to see the effect of memory movement onyour application.andP;  HeapWalker allows you to view the global heap, allowingyou to allocate and free memory interactively.andP;  The last tool, Spy, allowsyou to monitor system messages sent to a specified application window.andM;Help!andM;New to Windows 3 is a genericl help system.andP;  All applications can use it toprovide on-line help text.andP;  The SDK provides a help compiler', plus somedocumentation that describes how to make a help system and gives the extracode that is needed.andM;The application programmer comes the best out of this deal because while nottrivial, the extra code for a help system is hardly a major effort.andP;  Theperson who has the brain strain, however, is the help system writer.andP;  The hasto cope with the weird-but-powerful Microsoft help system format and a veryslow help compiler.andP;  so slow that, when I first compiled the help example, Ithought it had crashed - 70 seconds of 486 processing for a 35 KB file isserious.andM;The help writer has a lot of flexibility at his disposal.andP;  he can usebitmaps, multiple fonts, variable text sizes and different colours to lightenup the text, although for some reason you can't use the Symbol font.andP;  Thehelp can contain cross references which jump to another topic, cause a boxcontaining a definition to pop up and/or refer to an index independent of thetopic.andP;  Once you get the hang of it, it's really rather good.andM;The SDK comes with about four inches of documentation: four Microsoft perfectbound manuals, an IBM SAA CUA Design Guide and an installation guide.andP;  TheMicrosoft manuals are all typeset with a distinct splash of Ventura, and arewell-written but with heavy seasoning of spelling, formating and factualerrors.andP;  All the Microsoft manuals use the annoying Chapter Number-PageNumber scheme, for example 6-3, for page numbering.andM;The thin Installation and Update Guide provides the starting point for themanual set.andP;  The manual goes through installation, gives hints and tips foroptimising your development environment and provides an overview of Windows 3for new and Windows 2 SDK users.andP;  It's a good introduction to the SDK.andM;The Guide to Programming is Microsoft's latest attempt at a tutorial forWindows programming.andP;  It gets stuck between two hurdles, being too advancedfor the beginning user and lacking some meat for the advanced user, thoughthe advanced section is the best part.andP;  It is deal as an adjunct rather thana substitute for Charles Petzold's Programming Windows (ISBN 0-914845-91-8,Microsoft Press 22.95 pounds, but wait for the Windows 3 version) as itprovides information on the new whizzo-bang features that the current Petzoldbook doesn't.andM;The remaining manuals are Parts 1 and 2 of the Reference Guide.andP;  Part 1contains an introduction to each group of functions, and an alphabetical listwith description of each function and message.andP;  Part 2 contains the bits ofthe reference that donht fit into Part 1, such as assembly language macros,file formats, data types and structures, and a description of the 32-bitmemory management DLL.andM;Part 1 of the reference has the best layout of a Microsoft manual I've seen.andO;It has thumb tabs for easy reference, clear headings, proper typesetting andwell spaced text.andP;  All that is missing are examples to go with thedescriptions and removal of a large dose of double negatives in thedescriptions.andP;  Part 2 of the reference isn't nearly as good - the manysmaller reference pieces making it more difficult to find information.andM;When programming Windows with the SDK, I found that the Reference manualsbarely got touched, even for the new Windows 3 functions.andP;  Indeed, if ithadn't been for the review, I doubt they would have made it out of thewrappers.andP;  This is because of the splendid on-line help system.andP;  You have twochoices of help system: one for the Windows 3 help system (1.9 MB), the otherfor Quick Help, QuickC and C V6.0's Programmer's WorkBench (750 KB).andP;  I onlyused the Windows version, which allowed me to have one window with an editorand another with the help function.andP;  The help uses colours effectively, withgreen indicating a cross-reference and red indicating a Windows 3.0 function.andO;I found the ability to add an annotation to a help page invaluable, as wasthe facility to place a 'bookmark' on frequently used pages invaluable.andO;There are faults, however, such as the inability to paste a part of the helptext (for example, the function prototype), the inability to pick up thecontext from an editor and the lack of random text searching in the index.andM;The final manual is from IBM - the grandly titled IBM Common User AccessAdvanced Interface Design Guide.andP;  A better title is How IBM told Microsoft todo the User Interface for OS/2.andP;  It contains a mine of useless information,such as the Finnish for check box (tarkistusruutu), and a few coals of usefulstuff.andM;In addition to the paper documentation, there are five additional files onthe disk, two of which are READMEs: one in ASCII (8 KB), the other in Writeformat (57 KB).andP;  The other three contain a selection of wise sayings on howto use Windows with the C V6.0's Programmer's WorkBench, and how to programWindows with networks.andP;  The README also informs you that you can obtain anadditional document, 'The Windows Developer's Notes', for a nominal charge.andO;I have not managed to obtain a copy, but it is advertised to document thefollowing: Windows Setup Sources, Preparing Windows Applications forInternational Use, Windows Executable File Header Format, Windows Font FileFormat, Windows Support for DPMI and Windows Write and Calendar File Formats.andO;Why couldn't Microsoft just include this information in the SDK in the firstplace?andM;ConclusionandM;Microsoft has made a professional job of the SDK - it is a large improvementon the earlier version, and is good value for money.andP;  The tools supplied areadequate, but do leave a gap for enterprising companies to do better.andP;  Thedocumentation and help system make it easier to program Windows than everbefore.andP;  Nevertheless, even with this improved SDK, Windows remainsintimidating to the beginner.andM;Jeffrey Goldberg has eaten Raspeberries while playing Cricket in a field fullof Penguins for Borland.andP;  He is not stroking Fifi while feasting on Pizza atPsion.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
