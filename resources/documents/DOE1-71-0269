The initial discovery of a biological phenomenon, the geneticinheritance of responsiveness and nonresponsiveness to synthetic polypeptidesby outbred and inbred stains of animals, led eventually to a full geneticand cellular characterization of the critical first step in the initiationof an immune response. This step is the recognition by T lymphocytesof foreign antigens in association with gene products of the major histocompatibilitycomplex. The authors now are in the final phases of understanding ofthis event as molecular biologists clone the critical genes involvedand biochemists characterize the interactions between the various proteins.This movement from biological phenomenon, to cellular characterization,to molecular understanding is really the progress of all biological science.The purpose of this review is to try and capsulize this natural progressionin one area of immunology so that scientists entering into the fieldat the molecular level can have an appreciation for the roots from whichtheir problem developed.</TEXT></DOC>
