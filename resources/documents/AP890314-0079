An armed forces communique said rebels dynamited the CentralElections Council office in Santa Tecla, five miles west of SanSalvador. The Monday morning blast did ``considerable materialdamage,'' the communique said, but no one was injured.   A young man and woman who work in the central election center inLa Libertad province told The Associated Press on Monday that theywouldn't leave because they needed the work. They spoke on conditionof anonymity.   ``We all have to stay,'' the young man said. ``For necessity, tomake a living.''   The rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which hascalled for a boycott of the March 19 presidential election, alsorepeated its warning for vehicles to stay off roads. The rebels saidin a broadcast on their clandestine Radio Venceremos that vehicleswill be attacked beginning Thursday.   It said election workers who don't resign will be ``considered byour people as part of the counterinsurgency,'' making them rebeltargets.   Traffic bans have been a frequent tactic in the guerrillas'9-year-old war with the U.S.-backed government. They are by now afixture in Salvadoran elections.   The rebels have boycotted all five elections this decade, buttheir threats against election workers and the attack on theelection center were unprecedented.   The rebels offered to take part in this year's presidentialelection and accept its results if it were postponed until Septemberto give them time to prepare and if security and other conditionswere met. The government said it might consider a briefer delay, butthe rebels called the boycott.   Defense Minister Gen. Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova said themilitary had taken steps to ensure the ``security and protection ofthe people from the threats of the enemies of democracy'' during theelection.   The comment was part of his nationwide television broadcastannouncing the military was admitting responsibility for themassacre of 10 peasants in September. Nine soldiers will be turnedover to civilian authorities for prosecution.   The military initially blamed the slayings on guerrillas butreversed itself after U.S. pressure and months of investigation byjournalists and civilian authorities.   About 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have died in thecivil war.</TEXT></DOC>
