(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Voters on Tuesday will shape the futureof Mingo County, a poor backwater once so corrupt a fire chief rana drug ``carry-out'' and a sheriff allegedly helped protect thebusiness.   ``It's up to the people this time,'' said Michael Thornsbury, aWilliamson lawyer and first-time candidate who is running for thestate House of Delegates. ``They can choose the old way, or theycan take the best opportunity they've had to vote good, honestcandidates into office.''   Tales of corruption prompted voters to sweep incumbents out ofthe county courthouse in 1986. This year, most of the old guard _many under indictment _ didn't bother to run.   Even so, voters will have a wide choice.   Fifty political novices are among the 69 candidates who filedfor 12 offices, which include the legislature, county commissionand sheriff.   In 1986, voters ousted long-time Democratic party boss JohnieOwens and his slate of candidates in favor of those backed byOwens' enemy, Larry Hamrick.   Then in January 1987, an out-of-county judge and prosecutorspecially appointed by the state Supreme Court launched a grandjury investigation into county politics. Months later, 16politicians, including Hamrick, were indicted on charges ofconspiracy to subvert Mingo's free elections.   ``As ordinary citizens of Mingo County, we have been repeatedlyshocked and dismayed at the manner in which the county governmenthas been organized and run,'' the grand jury said.   ``What we have heard individually by way of rumor, hearsay andspeculation over the past several years has been verified to us bysworn testimony.''   Taking on the power structure is not easy for some ``ordinarycitizens,'' many of whom have long believed their livelihooddepended upon remaining in the politicians' good graces. Povertyallowed corruption to flourish, said Assistant U.S. Attorney JoeSavage, who heads a corruption investigation.   According to Savage, only 8,700 of the county's 36,000 residentshave jobs. More than 2,600 of the jobs are controlled bypoliticians, such as those who run the school board, the countycommission and the anti-poverty agency. As a result, Savage said,many residents believe they must vote the way they're told by thepoliticians.   ``The political bosses had a long-standing habit of threateningpeople's jobs, their food stamps, their Social Security, and manypeople just don't know that they _ the bosses _ can't really affectthose things,'' he said.   This year's deadline for filing for office passed long beforethe grand jury returned its indictments. But the investigation wasno secret, and when the filing period ended, most of the incumbents_ many previously aligned with Owens or Hamrick _ had decidedagainst seeking re-election.   ``There are an awful lot of just average good old people runningfor office this year,'' said Curtis Fletcher, a high schoolassistant principal who is one of five candidates vying for theDemocratic nomination for a county commission seat.   ``People had no idea what was going on with some of ourleaders,'' Fletcher said. ``They knew about who got gravel fortheir road and who got a job at the courthouse.''   Fletcher, a political newcomer, estimates he will spend about$2,000 for his campaign.   ``In the past, you couldn't get elected (to the commission)unless you were willing to spend $15,000 or $20,000,'' he said.   According to the indictments, much of that money went to buyvotes for politicians who in turn used their positions to protectfriends and family engaged in other illegal activities.   Former Sheriff Eddie Hilbert pleaded guilty to buying his jobfor $100,000 from Owens, his predecessor. Hilbert allegedly usedhis position to protect Kermit Fire Chief Wig Preece, who wasconvicted on federal charges of running a ``drug carry-out'' nextdoor to the town police department, headed by his son-in-law, DavidRamey.   Preece and Ramey, along with other relatives, were sentenced tolengthy prison terms for their role in Kermit's drug ring.   ``They were doing more business than the K-mart,'' said TennisHatfield, a former radio announcer who is a first-time candidaterunning for sheriff. ``When you can put up a sign on the buildingthat says `Out Of Drugs, Back In 30 Minutes,' there's somethingmore wrong than usual.''</TEXT></DOC>
