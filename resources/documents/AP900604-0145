Religious groups got the biggest chunk _ $54.32 billion, theAAFRC Trust for Philanthropy said.   ``Once again, Americans demonstrated the centrality ofphilanthropic giving not only to our culture but to our individuallives,'' said the report.   The increase in giving actually was 5.5 percent when adjusted forinflation, said the trust, an arm of the American Association ofFund-Raising Counsel.   The group was founded more than 50 years ago to advancephilanthropy.   Individual donations, which amounted to 84.1 percent of thetotal, increased 11.67 percent over 1988 _ or 6.7 percent, whenadjusted for inflation. They totaled $96.43 billion.   ``For every $5 we spent on food, we gave more than 80 cents,almost $1, to a worthy cause,'' said the report. ``For every $2 wespent on shoes and clothing, we gave $1 to philanthropy.''   ``Clearly, these comparisons show that philanthropy is notancillary to our lives, not something we do on the side.'' it said.   Part of the generosity was attributed to an 8.9 percent rise inpersonal income. The report also said a 21.1 percent stock marketupswing in 1989 probably evoked bigger gifts from the affluent. Italso cited growing awareness of AIDS, homelessness, the environmentand other concerns, and intensified fund-raising efforts.   Two natural disasters in 1989, the San Francisco earthquake andHurricane Hugo, generated an outpouring of financial aid. TheAmerican Red Cross, for example, received $155 million for bothdisasters, mostly from small, individual donations.   In all, 1989 contributions saw $6.7 billion from foundations, up8.93 percent, or 4 percent when adjusted for inflation; $6.57billion from bequests, the same overall but down 4.5 percent ininflation-adjusted dollars; and $5 billion for corporations, up 4.17percent overall, but down 0.5 percent over 1988 ininflation-adjusted dollars.   Overall, 47.4 percent of the year's donations, or $54.32 billion,went to houses of worship, religious organizations and the socialservices they provide. That was up 12.95 percent from 1988, or 7.4percent in inflation-adjusted dollars.   Catholic Charities, a coalition of 700 social service agencies,joined a trend that has grown among secular groups. It sponsored acredit card called ``Caritas''; one-half percent of each purchaseprice is earmarked as a donation.   In addition to religious groups, donations were divided among:   _Human services, $11.39 billion, up 8.58 percent, or 3.7 percentwhen adjusted for inflation.   _Education, $10.69 billion, up 4.49 percent, or ``a slight drop''when adjusted.   _Health, $10.04 billion, up 4.8 percent, or 0.1 percent whenadjusted.   _Arts, culture and humanities, $7.49 billion, up 10.31 percent,or 5.4 percent when adjusted.   _Public and society benefits _ including the environment, trafficsafety, animal rights, urban and rural development, and countlessother categories _ $3.62 billion, up 12.77 percent, or 7.7 percentwhen adjusted.   _All other uses, including overseas services, $17.13 billion, up10.8 percent, or 5.9 percent when adjusted.   It was the fourth consecutive year that corporate giving did notkeep pace with the rising costs faced by non-profit organizations.   Conversely, the report said that Japanese corporations ``showed agrowing interest during 1989 in fostering their own philanthropicefforts in this country.'' No figures were cited, however.   A majority of the contributions from American corporations isearmarked for education. Now, that money is increasingly benefitingchildren and alternative education programs, rather than colleges.   In 1988, 64 percent of all corporate education donations went tocolleges and universities, compared with about 70 percent in 1988.   In 1989, Coca-Cola, General Electric, IBM and RJR Nabiscoannounced education grants that will total $130 million over thenext decade. They place heavy emphasis on elementary and secondaryschooling, and higher education for minorities.</TEXT></DOC>
