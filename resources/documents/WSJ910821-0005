Company chairmen, in particular, are stepping upto the plate with significant purchases.   In the first two weeks of August, 10 company chairmenreported to the Securities and Exchange Commission that theyhad spent more than $100,000 each to buy their company'sstock. That's more six-figure buying than chairmen hadreported in the previous six weeks combined. In all cases,the SEC reports referred to purchases made about one monthearlier.</LP><TEXT>   This shift to the bullish is preliminary. Corporateinsiders -- executives, directors and major shareholders --are still, as a group, net sellers of stock. But experts whoanalyze insider data say it's the first significant buying inmonths.   Many investors closely watch insider buying and sellingfor clues to a company's prospects and the possible directionof its stock price. Some analysts go further and regard broadtrends in insider activity as a leading indicator of theoverall stock market's direction.   Insiders started unloading shares in droves early inFebruary, selling stock into the tail end of the stockmarket's rally in January and February. Insider activityskewed even more heavily to selling in May and June, as newSEC regulations allowed insiders simultaneously to exercisestock options to buy shares and immediately resell them. Infact, SEC filings show that insiders have been aggressivesellers ever since the Dow Jones Industrial Average got miredin its current trading range of about 2850 to 3050.   But now, &quot;the selling has abated, and there's an increasein buying,&quot; said Robert Gabele, president of Invest/Net, aNorth Miami, Fla., company that tracks and analyzes insiderdata. In fact, insiders have been outright bulls oninterest-rate sensitive stocks such as utilities, he said.Other industries &quot;inching towards the bullish side of thefence,&quot; he said, are the food and beverage businesses and theoil and gas industries.   On the other hand, despite the fact that prices of manyapparel, brokerage-business and computer stocks have fallenfrom the highs set earlier this year, there's no sign yet ofinsider bottom-fishing in those industries. And otherscaution it's far too early to break out the bubbly for thebroad stock market. &quot;The {insider} selling has been easingsomewhat,&quot; said David Coleman, editor of Vickers WeeklyInsider Report, a newsletter. But he adds that it's difficultto know whether insiders have simply sold as much stock asthey feel comfortable with &quot;or whether {insiders} arechanging their positions.&quot;   As for the bullish chairmen:   At California Energy Inc., which sells power wholesale toutilities in several states, Chairman David L. Sokol bought175,300 shares for $2.2 million in July, SEC filings show. Hewas a first-time buyer of company stock.   Mr. Sokol, who took over as chairman of the Omaha, Neb.,firm in February, said he's betting that demand for electricpower will increase as the country comes out of recession,and that demand for the geothermal and &quot;clean&quot; gas power thathis company sells will be particularly keen as a result ofenvironmental concerns.   Mr. Sokol paid an average price of $12.75 a share. InAmerican Stock Exchange composite trading, California Energyshares closed yesterday at $13.25, up 12.5 cents.   At another utility, Washington Energy Co. in Seattle,Wash., Chairman James Thorpe increased his company holdingsby 10% with a $91,198 purchase on July 25, SEC filings show.   Mr. Thorpe said the strong Northwest economy andincreasing demand for gas lines in the Puget Sound area,which the company serves, gave him &quot;great confidence&quot; inWashington Energy. He added that its Washington Natural Gasunit, which provides 80% of revenue, was showing &quot;the highestcustomer growth rate of any utility in the country.&quot;   Although the purchase was through the exercise of options,Mr. Thorpe paid just slightly below market price for theshares, $18.54 each. In national over-the-counter tradingyesterday, Washington Energy shares closed unchanged at $22.   Philip Colburn, chairman of the Allen Group Inc., aMelville, N.Y., firm that manufactures auto-diagnosticequipment and cellular mobile communications equipment,increased his company holdings 20% with a 10,000-sharepurchase on June 21, SEC filings show.   &quot;Our company is undervalued based on the progress we'vemade,&quot; he said. &quot;We've weathered the recession, and now ourfastest-growing division is cellular equipment, which hasvery steady growth in excess of 20% a year for the past fiveyears,&quot; he added.   Mr. Colburn paid $13.88 each for the shares. The stock hassince edged higher, closing at $15.25, up 25 cents, in NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading.   T. Wayne Davis, chairman of Jacksonville, Fla., GeneralParcel Service Inc., paid about $629,000, or $2.88 a share,for stock in the overnight parcel-delivery company. SECfilings show he is a regular buyer of company stock. Thispurchase, according to Mr. Davis, was in response to anotification by Nasdaq that the company had a capitaldeficiency. He thus bought stock from the company, increasingits capital holdings.   The stock is up substantially since his purchase. Inover-the-counter trading, General Parcel Service shares werequoted at $4.625 bid, unchanged.   &quot;The company has a lot in common with a Federal Expressstory,&quot; he said, &quot;where you put a lot of money in the frontend. I've been through the extremely rough times and am nowlooking forward to the enjoyable times.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
