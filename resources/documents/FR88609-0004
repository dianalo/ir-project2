This matterwas discussed in the final rule revising 10 CFR Part 35 (51 FR 36932, October16, 1986).The NRC staff has developed the form, and the Office of Management andBudget (OMB) has approved its use. The NRC is amending its regulationsto insert the form number in the regulatory text. A copy of the form willbe mailed to NRC medical use licensees.This amendment is a minor administrative change to an existing final rule.It merely adds the form number for an NRC form to the codified rule. Thenumber had been omitted because OMB had not completed its review. Basedon this, good cause exists to find that the notice and public procedureprovisions of the Administrative Procedure Act are unnecessary pursuantto the exemption provision found in 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). Therefore, theamendment is effective upon publication in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Statements</ITAG><T3>Environmental Impact: </T3>Categorical Exclusion.The NRC has determined that this regulation is the type of action describedin categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(3).
