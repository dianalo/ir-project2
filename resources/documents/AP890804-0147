The exchanges, meanwhile, still feeling the sting of indictmentsagainst 46 traders Wednesday, took steps to implement tougher rulesand penalties and increase scrutiny of the trading floor.   The head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange said Thursday themeasures were intended ``to put the fear of God into themembership.''   The Chicago Board of Trade took out full-page ads in today'seditions of several newspapers, including The New York Times andThe Washington Post. In them, the exchange promises to investigateall reports of wrongdoing and take disciplinary action againstthose found guilty.   And the Chicago Sun-Times reported in today's editions that morethan 100 additional traders will be indicted this year as a resultof the investigation, according to unnamed defense and governmentsources.   David Neisler of El Paso, Ill., identified in the indictments asone of the customers victimized by the illegal trading practices,said Thursday, ``I don't know what to make of the whole thing.''   Neisler said he has used the futures markets for nearly 20 yearsas a hedge against his investment in the soybean crop he grows onpart of a 1,500-acre family farm.   ``I don't suppose I'll know how much is gone until this goesthrough trial,'' Neisler said. ``But it's like somebody telling youthat you got gypped when you bought clothes at the department storenot too long ago, and not telling you much else,'' he said.   ``You don't know how much, you don't why, you just know you'vebeen gypped.''   Peter Gerlikas, another investor identified in the indictments,said he lost $6,000 in a year and had heard talk of illegal tradingactivities from friends at the Board of Trade.   ``I'd heard rumors, but I traded through a reputable company andI didn't figure this would touch me,'' said Gerlikas, a 31-year-oldwho runs a string of small businesses from his home in thenorthwest Chicago suburb of Palatine.   ``Looking back now, I have no real way of knowing how much, ifany, of the $6,000 was taken through illegal trades.''   Gerlikas said, however, he might return to the Merc in thefuture.   ``There'll always be dishonesty,'' he said, ``but I've got afeeling they're going to clean things up this time around.''   Both exchanges sought to get started with the cleanup Thursday.   ``The integrity of the markets and public confidence in them isour highest priority,'' Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc'sexecutive committee, said at a news conference. ``If we falter inthis responsibility, we will lose the right of self-regulation.''   Trading practices in the Chicago markets have come under severescrutiny from federal regulators and politicians since thedisclosure earlier this year of the 2{-year federal undercoverinvestigation that led to the indictments.   Rule changes enacted and proposed by the markets _ which for themost part regulate their own trading practices _ appear to be aimednot only at cracking down on wrongdoing but also heading offpossibly tougher restrictions by lawmakers and regulators.   One new rule adopted by the Merc calls for automatic expulsionof any trader found guilty of a second offense involving acustomer's account.   ``That's what we meant by putting the fear of God into themembership,'' said Melamed.   But the most significant rule change approved by the Merc'sBoard of Governors requires membership approval. It would severelylimit dual trading, in which a trader is allowed to trade on hisown account as well as those of customers.   That practice made possible many of the frauds alleged in theindictments: pre-arranged trades; order crossing, in which a tradercrosses buy and sell orders rather than bring them to thecompetitive auction process of the pit; and front-running, where atrader trades on his own account in advance of a large customerorder, knowing the price of a commodity will rise or fall becauseof the order following it.   The Board of Trade issued a similar response late Wednesday,proposing tougher regulations, penalties and surveillance measures.   The indictments accused traders of systematically conspiring toskim profits from customer accounts and attempting to hide earningsfrom the Internal Revenue Service.   In announcing the indictments, U.S. Attorney Anton Valukascalled the amount customers may have lost by fraud ``significant,''but declined to specify the amount.   Brokers trading for their own accounts as well as customers'accounts were alleged to have routinely and illegally cheatedcustomers with the cooperation of ``locals'' _ traders who tradedonly for their own accounts.   Eighteen of the defendants were charged with violating thefederal Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations act, whichcarries penalties of up to 20 years in prison. The law alsoempowers the government to freeze defendants' assets before trialfor seizure upon conviction.   Fourteen of those charged already have agreed to plead guiltyand cooperate with investigators, according to government sourceswho spoke on condition of anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
