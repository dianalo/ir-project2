He unveiled his ``National Merit School'' idea Tuesday at aluncheon honoring 139 high school seniors who are the 1988Presidential Scholars.   Saying ``our schools are absolutely not as good as they mustbe,'' Bush said he would stress policies that reward excellence andbetter performance.   The likely Republican nominee also called for awarding states $1million each for ``experimentation and innovation'' in areas suchas merit pay for teachers and year-round schools.   ``Our program for the future must be built around a strategy ofinvesting in our children,'' Bush said.   The federal government pays only 7 percent of local publicschool costs, and that isn't going to change, said Bush.   ``When it comes to better schools, almost all of the wisdom andthe good answers and the money to pay the bills should come fromoutside Washington, D.C.,'' he said.   But then Bush, who has been accused by Michael Dukakis andothers of offering little to back up his oft-repeated intention ofbeing ``the education president,'' took the wraps off his``National Merit School'' idea.   It would honor schools that ``significantly improve theirperformance'' on test scores, dropout rates or other measuresselected by each state, and it would shower cash awards on the top20 percent of schools with ``a significant proportion ofdisadvantaged students,'' the vice president said.   The awards would be based on school size and would average$100,000 for up to 5,000 schools.   ``Each winning school could use the money as it pleased _ forlab equipment, library books, or rewards for teachers andprincipals,'' he said.   The vice president also called for expanding an existing $12million program to $50 million for financing experiments ineducation reform. ``Only by testing these concepts in practice willwe be able to learn which reforms work and which do not,'' he said.   He also backed a proposal by Education Secretary William Bennettfor giving $50 million to states for matching grants to create orsupport magnet schools that feature academic or vocationalspecialties.   Bennett said in a statement: ``The vice president has focused onthe central issues of education reform: accountability, choice,raising standards and rewarding success. This is a good agenda forthe `education president.'''   Bush urged the National Education Association, the 1.9million-member teacher union, to support merit pay for the bestteachers.   Howard Carroll, an NEA spokesman, replied: ``That's a lot ofbaloney. That doesn't work.''   Of Bush's merit school program, Carroll said the $500 millionwould ``set up another bureaucracy. That money could better bespent on Chapter One or other programs that desperately need it.''Chapter One is the government's $4 billion program to help pay forremedial education for the poor.   Bush said that school reform must put ``an emphasis onaccountability ... changing what doesn't work and rewarding whatdoes.''   Bush also reiterated his support for tax-free savings bonds tohelp finance college educations.   Charles W. Greenleaf Jr., Bush's domestic affairs adviser, saidthe new proposals outlined on Tuesday are ``by no means all'' ofBush's educational plans. Additional ones will be detailed thissummer, he said.   Greenleaf said that the total $600 million pricetag would haveto be offset by savings in other areas under Bush's ``flexiblefreeze'' proposal to hold overall federal spending to the rate ofinflation, but no decisions have been made on where those cutswould be made.</TEXT></DOC>
