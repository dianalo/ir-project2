But her tears cannot keep the young people in their gang colorsout of her neighborhood _ one of the areas of the city sufferingfrom an increase of nearly 70 percent in gang-related killings sofar this year.   Police say the use of heavier caliber guns and the closure of 10city hospitals in four years have contributed to the surge ingang-related deaths. The reluctance of witnesses to testify againstgang members adds to the frustration of victims' families.   ``People saw,'' Mrs. Rodriguez says of her daughter's shooting,her eyes swollen from weeping as she stands in front of herfamily's small candy store in a predominanty Hispanic neighborhoodsouthwest of downtown.   ``I bend down on my knees. I say, `Please tell me.' They don'tsay anything.''   Mrs. Rodriguez says she has too much invested to leave thisworking-class neighborhood, where she moved 32 years ago fromPuerto Rico and raised 10 children.   One of those children was Delma, who was 28 when she died onJuly 1, 1987, the victim of a bullet fired from the darkness as shesat with her mother on the hood of a car near the family home andthe store.   ``I only pray some day they catch the guy,'' Mrs. Rodriguez says.   The killing was one of four in a four-square-block area in thelast two years, says Frances Sandoval, another neighborhoodresident and victim of gang violence.   Mrs. Sandoval founded Mothers Against Gangs after her oldestson, Arthur, was fatally stabbed by a gang member in 1985. She saysArthur, an honor student and 15-year-old high school sophomore, hadcome to the aid of a friend's sister.   Gang-related killings increased to 37 through July from 22 inthe same period last year, a jump of 68 percent, authorities said.   However, Cmdr. Sollie Vincent, head of the Police Department'sGang Crimes Unit, said gang warfare has not escalated as much asthe death count suggests. The number of gang-related aggravatedbattery cases such as shootings and stabbings rose to 730 in thefirst seven months of this year from 700 in the same period lastyear, he said.   ``We suspect that they are using better weaponry, probablyheavier caliber guns,'' Vincent said.   Hospital closings that have stretched emergency room resourcesthin also may be aggravating the death toll, he added.   Gang killings have worsened in other major cities as well. LosAngeles County expects more than 420 gang-related killings thisyear, up from 387 in 1987, and drive-by slayings now average morethan one a day. Los Angeles gangs are expanding theircocaine-trafficking networks as far away as Seattle, Kansas City,Mo., and Philadelphia.   In Chicago, there are an estimated 125 gangs involving 12,000 to15,000 youths with an average age of about 18, Vincent said. Somemembers are as young as 10 or 11.   The gangs account for about 1 percent of all city crime, but 5percent to 6 percent of homicides, Vincent said.   Most gang members are black or Hispanic, the products ofpoverty, poor schools or broken families, he said.   The black gangs tend to be heavily involved in drug trafficking,Vincent said. The Hispanic gangs seem more interested in protectingterritory and showing gang colors, resulting in more ``irrational''shootings, he said.   There's an elementary school across the street from Mrs.Rodriguez's store, and a Catholic church across a small plaza wherechildren play football by day.   But after sundown, the neighborhood streets often are claimed byclusters of young people displaying their gang colors.   ``We're talking about a small minority that has been allowed todefame our community,'' Mrs. Sandoval said.   Some of the recent gang-linked shootings have been drive-bys.Mrs. Sandoval says police often are slow to respond to gangviolence, allow young people to congregate past curfew and reassigndetectives and gang specialists to civic festivals.   Vincent denies that enforcement has been lax.   ``In a drive-by shooting, if you had a million police, how couldyou stop that?'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
