In a lot of cities, that anchor would have been aweighlong ago. But the outrageous and often offensive Bill Bondsis the most popular local TV personality in Detroit. He isDetroit's own version of newsman Howard Beale of the movie&quot;Network,&quot; who was mad as hell and wouldn't take it any more.</LP><TEXT>   How popular is he? After his challenge to the mayor, hedisappeared from the airwaves for five weeks during alcoholtreatment; when he returned, nearly a million viewers -- moreDetroiters than watched Game 1 of the World Series that year-- tuned into the ABC affiliate to see the dried-out Mr.Bonds.   At 5 p.m., when many viewers are blue-collar workers homefrom the early shift, Mr. Bonds's newscast draws twice asmany viewers as the next most popular newscast. At 11 p.m.,he runs neck-and-neck for the No. 1 spot. The 59-year-old Mr.Bonds recently signed a lifetime contract with WXYZ that willpay him more than $1 million a year as anchor for up to sevenmore years, a big figure for a local anchor. Then he'llcontinue as a commentator, which he really is already.   Mr. Bonds's newscasts are a world away from the blow-driednews of most markets. They're less traditional reporting thana kind of &quot;here's what happened in the world today and what Ithink about it.&quot; The earthy Mr. Bonds doesn't think much ofsome of his fancy TV colleagues; in private, he does anunprintable impression of an uptight Dan Rather during anintimate moment.   Earlier in his career, Mr. Bonds failed in efforts to makeit big in Los Angeles and New York because he didn't fit ineither city. But his success in Motown shows that he's &quot;ametaphor for Detroit,&quot; says Richard Campbell, a University ofMichigan expert on broadcast news. Just as Detroit's economyendures wild cyclical swings, Mr. Campbell says, Mr. Bonds&quot;captures the contradictory nature of the city. He gets introuble a lot, and gets back up.&quot;   When Mr. Bonds returned to the air in 1989, he toldviewers: &quot;Booze, very frankly, had taken over my life. I wasa man out of control, headed for, I'm sure, death, insanityor perhaps even prison.&quot; He refuses now to say if he drinksat all. But since his treatment, he has gotten into at leastone bar scuffle, which was frontpage news here. &quot;Thenewspapers get on Bill for getting into bar fights, but whatthe hell is wrong with that?&quot; asks Erik Smith, a veteranreporter at WXYZ. &quot;That's what Detroit is about. This is atough town.&quot;   This is the city where a giant sculpture of a fist -- thatof Joe Louis, boxing legend and native son -- adorns adowntown street. The pro basketball Pistons take pride inbeing called the &quot;Bad Boys.&quot; Detroit Monthly magazinerecently devoted a cover story to the Detroit Attitude, asexemplified by Madonna, a local product, and the late TyCobb, the Detroit Tigers' Hall of Famer who used to slideinto second base with the sharpened spikes of his shoes aimedhigh. Local shops carry a T-shirt that brags: &quot;Detroit --where the weak are killed and eaten.&quot;   &quot;A lot of people look to Bill as the guy who thumbs hisnose at authority and acts as their surrogate,&quot; says MortCrim, the anchor on the NBC affiliate in Detroit and Mr.Bonds's chief competitor. &quot;That's why it works here for himand didn't work for him in Los Angeles and New York.&quot;   Part of the Bonds appeal is that he was born and raised inworking-class Detroit. He grew up in the city's 12th Streetarea populated chiefly by Irish and Jewish families. He leftone high school by &quot;mutual consent,&quot; he says, was kicked outof another and dropped out of his final stop. He eventuallyjoined the Air Force and there passed his high schoolequivalency test.   After his stint in the military, Mr. Bonds earned apolitical science degree at the University of Detroit. Hisfirst professional broadcast job, as he still remindsviewers, was working for &quot;a buck an hour&quot; at a tiny radiostation in Albion, Mich., where he even swept the floors. In1964, he broke into television by joining WXYZ. Back then,the station's local newcasts were weak in content andratings. Detroit's 1967 riot changed that.   The riot began only a few blocks from where Mr. Bonds grewup. Forty-three people were killed, making it the nation'sworst civil disturbance of a turbulent decade. Mayor ColemanYoung now refuses to be interviewed by Mr. Bonds -- &quot;I don'tcare to be interviewed by unstable characters,&quot; he says --but he recently told the Detroit News that the newsman'scoverage of the riot was full of compassion, unlike other TVaccounts. &quot;I was watching something I loved die,&quot; Mr. Bondssays today.   His performance attracted national attention, and a yearlater Mr. Bonds left to be the anchor at the ABC affiliate inLos Angeles. His ratings were good, but he quarreled with thestation's management and returned to Detroit in 1971. Mr.Bonds left again in 1975 for New York but had troublebreaking into an established lineup. The next year, hereturned to Detroit, this time for good.   Or for bad. Mr. Bonds offends just about everyoneperiodically -- including his own employer. After WKBD,Channel 50, the major local independent station, aired arecent Pistons playoff game that went down to the wire, Mr.Bonds told his viewers: &quot;Channel 50, God bless them, musthave had a 90 rating tonight.&quot; The people in WXYZ's controlroom tend to groan when Mr. Bonds says such things.   Many people in Detroit's gay community still won't talk toMr. Bonds because of his &quot;special report&quot; on AIDS in 1985,says Craig Covey, a longtime local advocate for homosexualsand AIDS victims. &quot;It made us lose a year or two abouteducating people about the disease,&quot; says Mr. Covey. But Mr.Bonds makes no apologies for saying that some gays werepurposely trying to spread the disease. &quot;It didn't get me ina lot of trouble with the heterosexuals in town who don'twant to get AIDS,&quot; he says.   At a Pistons basketball game last year, when Mr. Bondsappeared at half time to shoot free throws for charity, thecrowd booed him. Mr. Bonds, dressed in an electric pinkshirt, responded by blowing kisses to the crowd and thensinking three straight free throws.   Fans only boo if they love you, he explains later. &quot;I'vehad people come up to me and say, `Bonds, you're the mostopinionated, arrogant SOB I've ever seen,'&quot; he says. Andthen, he says, they ask for his autograph.</TEXT></DOC>
