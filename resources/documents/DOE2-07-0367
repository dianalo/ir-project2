The authors first analyze the computational requirement of thegeneration process. They then identify aspects of this computation thatcould benefit from being carried out in parallel. The Penman generatoris composed of a systemic grammar, the Nigel grammar, and its environment.These two components are functionally separated and interface to eachother via an inquiry mechanism. This implies that Nigel and its environmentcan be processed in a distributed way. We also illustrate how both Nigeland the major part of its environment, the KL-TWO knowledge base, caneach be processed in parallel. In the Nigel grammar, the systems, choosersand realization statements can be activated simultaneously accordingto some computational dependency that resembles the system network. TheKL-TWO knowledge base can be implemented as a parallel computing system,and two existing approaches, using Classifier Systems and ConnectionistModels, respectively, are analyzed and assessed.</TEXT></DOC>
