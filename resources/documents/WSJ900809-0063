But seriousquestions remain about where prices will settle.   While Saudi Arabia and some other oil-exporting nationsare prepared to increase production to offset any shortagescaused by the Persian Gulf crisis, it will be several weeksbefore they can get up to full speed. Even then, world oilproduction may fall short of pre-crisis levels by as much asa million barrels a day.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, the administration continues to drag its heelson a key decision to help make up the oil shortage by pumpingoil out of its strategic reserves. Oil experts say use of thereserves would go a long way toward keeping oil prices below$25 a barrel and cushioning the effect on the U.S. economy.   So far, the administration can claim surprising success inits strategy to head off the damaging effects of high oilprices. It has apparently won an agreement from Saudi Arabiato produce an additional two million barrels of oil a day,and an agreement from Venezuela to produce an additional500,000 barrels a day. Mexico also announced plans to chip inan additional 100,000 barrels temporarily, and otheroil-producing nations are expected to bring the totaladditional production to about 3.5 million barrels a day.   That's still short, however, of the four million to 4.5million barrels a day that was being supplied to the world byIraq and Kuwait. And in the volatile oil markets, which aredriven by psychology as much as substance, a shortage of500,000 to a million barrels a day in a53-million-barrel-a-day business can be critical in drivingprices higher.   As a result, the Bush administration's decision on whetherto use its reserves could hold the key to whether pricescontinue to move down, or head up again.   President Bush said the White House would &quot;explore&quot;whether to use its reserves to help make up the shortfall.Inside the administration, however, the issue is stillcausing deep divisions. The Department of Energy is pushingfor use of the reserves, and would like a presidentialdecision by the end of the week. But Budget Director RichardDarman and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu areresisting that move, fearing it involves unnecessarymanipulation of the market place.   The U.S. is scheduled to discuss the use of strategicpetroleum reserves with its allies at a meeting in Paristomorrow. In an interview last night, James Watkins, the U.S.energy secretary, said his department could get oil flowingout of the 590 million-barrel reserve in two weeks and thatit could &quot;quite possibly&quot; draw down enough to meet U.S.energy needs and to share with countries that don't havegovernment inventories.   Mr. Watkins also suggested that, although oil prices havebeen oscillating, since 1988 they've averaged a nominal $18 abarrel. Because of this, he said, he would &quot;feel better aboutprices anything below $22 and down to $18. Close to $18 to$20 is the way it should be.&quot;   While the White House debated the use of strategicreserves internally, a few oil producing nations quietlybegan to boost output. None of the countries involved,however, would talk about their actions or what promises theymade the Bush administration.   &quot;This is an extremely sensitive political matter,&quot; said anoil official with one of the Persian Gulf producers.   Saudi petroleum ministry officials reached in Jeddahdeclined to comment about either their production levels ortheir plans. But people familiar with Saudi developments saidthe kingdom is preparing to advance its output by up to thetwo million barrels a day the Bush administration had sought.   It is understood that Saudi officials assume that theirmaximum sustainable capacity is about 7.5 million barrels aday, though that hasn't been tested in some time. The kingdomrecently has been producing 5.4 million barrels a day.Getting to full capacity would take the Saudis a minimum of afew weeks, people knowledgeable about the country's oiloperation said.   Venezuela also is believed to have begun increasing itsoil production even before it advised the U.S. it couldsupply more oil. In all, Venezuela is expected to be able toraise output some 600,000 barrels a day, although Venezuelanofficials were cautious in their comments. President CarlosAndres Perez said only that production could be increased400,000 to 500,000 barrels a day if necessary. But he saidthis would have to be part of a &quot;collective agreement&quot; by theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   Nigeria also said it is willing to increase oil production200,000 barrels a day if other OPEC members agreed. &quot;Ibelieve that it is unfair for Saudi Arabia and Venezuelaalone to take up whatever shortfall has been created by thetension in the Persian Gulf,&quot; Jubril Aminu, Nigeria's oilminister, said.   Iran said it could supply some 500,000 barrels a day moreto world oil markets. Some oil experts question that, but theissue remained academic. Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oilminister, called for OPEC members to continue to restrictoutput to their quotas for the time being.   Similar advice came from the United Arab Emirates, whichformerly was notorious in OPEC for ignoring its quota. ButJapanese buyers, hurt by the boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiticrudes, apparently are being told that they can expect moreUAE crude coming their way. It's generally assumed the UAEwill increase output 500,000 barrels a day.   A further 200,000 barrels or so could be produced asadditional oil by other OPEC members. That would provide atotal of around 3.5 million barrels a day.   While this wouldn't be enough production to offset all theoil cut off from Iraq and Kuwait, it would cushion the impacton world oil markets. Also, the three OPEC producers of SaudiArabia, Venezuela and Iran have huge inventories of oil instorage or in tankers at sea -- 50 million barrels, by someestimates -- that could be immediately sold into the market.&quot;Indeed, the two big components of oil on the water (storedoil) are Saudi Arabian and Iranian,&quot; said Roy Mason,publisher of Oil Afloat.   Meanwhile, White House foot-dragging on whether to use thestrategic petroleum reserve has begun to draw criticism fromsome outside experts. &quot;The trick to get the benefit of thestrategic petroleum reserve is to use it early,&quot; says WilliamHogan, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government.&quot;There's a danger we will procrastinate because we aren'tsure what to do.&quot;   Members of Congress are pressing as well. Theadministration has made &quot;a major strategic mistake&quot; by notusing the reserve sooner, Rep. Thomas McMillen (D.,Md.) saidat a hearing this week. And Rep. Mary Rose Oakar asked:&quot;Couldn't the strategic petroleum reserve be used somewhatlike the Federal Reserve uses its monetary powers infinancial markets to provide economic stability to petroleummarkets? Why isn't this being done?&quot;   One White House aide argued, however, that movements inoil prices over the past week weren't enough of a disruptionto justify use of the reserves. &quot;I would define a disruptionin geopolitical terms if the Iraqis invade the Saudi oilfields,&quot; the aide said. &quot;But in current market conditions, Idon't think the price has moved enough.&quot;   John Easton, assistant secretary of energy forinternational affairs, will discuss the use of oil reserveswith U.S. allies today at a meeting of the InternationalEnergy Agency in Paris. Administration officials have saidthe U.S. will use its reserves only if its allies agree to dothe same.   Some analysts say that if the president decides to drawdown, say, a million barrels a day, he could perhaps reduceoil prices to the low $20-a-barrel range, and consequentlyhelp hold down gasoline and other energy costs.   &quot;The psychology of the market would really calm down ifthat's done,&quot; says Joseph Stanislaw of Cambridge EnergyAssociates, who predicts oil prices could then remain ataround $25 a barrel until the crisis is resolved.   &quot;Prices aren't going to go back to $20,&quot; says AntonioSzabo of Bonner andamp; Moore, a Houston consulting firm. &quot;But theymay be more like $22 to $24, if all these things happen.&quot;Analysts quickly add, however, that oil prices will skyrocketif the Iraqi military attacks Saudi Arabian productionfacilities in the next few days.   Yesterday's declines left oil prices still $10 above theyear's lows. In heavy trading yesterday on the New YorkMercantile Exchange, the futures price of crude oil forSeptember delivery fell $2.35 a barrel to $25.96. Futuresprices of the North Sea's Brent crude was down as much as$2.80 a barrel on the London-based International PetroleumExchange.   Even so, the volume of crude oil flowing into worldmarkets is beginning to decline rapidly as the globalsanctions against Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil take their toll.According to a leading monitor of its output, OPEC productionwas down two million barrels a day in the first week ofAugust from late July's 23 million barrels a day. Another twomillion-barrel drop is expected for the second week.   Meanwhile, after waffling through several days ofagonizing consultations among its oil ministers, OPEC itselfbacked off from any coordinated response to the reducedexports. Nor would it endorse any breaking of the Julyproduction agreement that had been designed to shrink oilsupplies rather than increase them.   &quot;Fears expressed regarding possible disruptions in oilsupply in the short term are rather a result of psychologicaland speculative factors than of real market fundamentals,&quot;said Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil minister and OPEC'spresident, after one member pressed for an emergency meetingon output limits.   But sooner or later, OPEC experts said, the exporters'organization will have to address the supply issue as agroup. &quot;Otherwise, it will be faced with unilateral actions&quot;by those member countries that can produce more, said BahmanKarbassioun, a former OPEC official and Vienna-basedconsultant.   ---   Allanna Sullivan contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
