Whichever his intent, Mr. Sokolov's rumors of violence should not discourage visits to Spain by Americans with enough common sense to stay out of dark alleys.    Last winter we lived in Portugal and traveled frequently to Spain. We visited Mr. Sokolov's supposedly dark and dangerous cities several times. We are not fluent in Spanish, but drove a rental car, lodged in ordinary hotels and ate in local cafes. Not once were we accosted or threatened. Spain is an absolute delight with its great climate, wonderful scenery and friendly people. We walked everywhere, rode public transportation and even permitted our 12-year-old son to go off on his own in major cities. We felt a lot safer than we do when visiting New York or other American cities.    David L. Jameson   Little Rock, Ark.</TEXT></DOC>
