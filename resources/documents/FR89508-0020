By the Commission.The full text of this Commission decision is available for inspection andcopying during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch (Room 230),1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC.

In General</ITAG>1. This Commission has concluded that incentive regulation for ATandamp;Tlocal exchange carriers (LECs) constitutes an improvement over traditionalrate of return regulation in terms of efficiency incentives, incentivesto innovate, disincentives to engage in cost shifting, lower administrativecosts, and consumer benefits. We find that rate of return regulation encouragesrate base padding and excessive expense levels, that it does not encouragecarrier innovation in the provision of new services and products, thatit encourages cross-subsidization and other forms of inefficient pricing,and that it places unnecessary administrative burdens on carriers and thisCommission. By focusing in the first instance on limiting prices ratherthan profits, incentive regulation should reverse the tendency of rateof return regulated firms to engage in inefficient behavior. We recognizethat achievement of the benefits of incentive regulation depends upon properimplementation. We here adopt final rules implementing a form of incentiveregulation, referred to as ``price caps,'' for ATandamp;T.2. We conclude that price caps for ATandamp;T will more closely replicatethe incentives to efficiency that characterize a competitive market thanwill continued rate of return regulation. By limiting the rates ATandamp;Tmay charge, rather than its rate of return, price caps will drive ATandamp;Tto avoid unnecessary costs, invest in efficiency enhancing technology,and employ innovative service approaches in order to earn the greatestlevels of return within the applicable rate limitations. The system ofprice cap regulation that we have adopted guarantees that ratepayers obtaintheir share of expected productivity gains first, with carriers retainingany additional profits they may generate. Thus, both ratepayers and carrierswill be better off than under rate of return regulation.3. We find that in an environment that is in transition from monopoly tofull competition, rate of return regulation has become so dysfunctionalthat incentive regulation represents a substantial and needed improvementover existing regulation. In addition, the presence of competition formany of ATandamp;T's services means that regulation, in whatever form, isnot the only check on ATandamp;T's ability to set its prices. Finally, weaffirm our view that competition and incentive regulation are complementaryand that competition must be a factor in shaping the form of incentiveregulation for ATandamp;T.4. We conclude that price cap regulation is unlikely to result in eithera decline in service quality, or an increase in misallocation of costsbetween the state and interstate jurisdictions. There are a number of constraintson ATandamp;T's ability to degrade its quality of service, including competition,Commission monitoring, and performance standards incorporated in tariffs.In areas where interexchange competition is limited, <T3>i.e.,</T3> non-equal access areas, we conclude that additional monitoringis required to ensure that service quality does not decline. In addition,while the possibility of cost-shifting between jurisdictions is inherentin a bifurcated regulatory system, we conclude that the combination ofthe separations rules, Commission monitoring associated with our automatedreporting requirements (ARMIS), and state monitoring will be effectivein identifying and correcting misallocation of costs to either the stateor the interstate jurisdiction.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Operation of Price Cap Regulation for ATandamp;T</ITAG>A. In General5. Price cap regulation is mandatory for ATandamp;T, and ATandamp;T will berequired to file price cap tariffs on an annual basis. We require thatATandamp;T file its first price cap tariff May 17, 1989, to be effectiveJuly 1, 1989, and thereafter to file its annual tariffs effective July1, on not less than 45 days' notice. Price cap filings must be accompaniedby price cap indexes (PCIs) (which reflect changes in costs associatedwith the provision of service groupings, or baskets), actual price indexes(APIs) (which reflect changes in aggregate rate levels for baskets), andservice band indexes (SBIs) (which reflect changes in rates for servicecategories within each basket). As long as ATandamp;T's proposed rate levelchanges are within applicable cap and band limitations, the tariff filingswill be presumed lawful, and except for the 45-day annual filing, may takeeffect in 14 days.B. ATandamp;T Services Subject to Price Cap Regulation6. All of ATandamp;T's existing services will be subject to price cap regulationwith the exception of Tariff 5, Tariff 11, Tariff 12, Tariff 15, and Tariff16 services, and services subject to separate accounting requirements (AccunetPacket Switching, Non-IMTS, and Skynet KU). Tariff 5 services are specialconstruction services, and Tariff 11 is ATandamp;T's access flow-throughtariff. Tariff 12, Tariff 15, and Tariff 16, in their present configurations,are custom tariffs, for which price cap treatment is not appropriate.7. Each of ATandamp;T's capped services will be placed in one of three baskets.Each basket has its own PCI, which acts as a ceiling on the basket's aggregaterates. The API is the value of aggregate rates in a basket. Under pricecaps, a basket's API must never exceed its PCI, absent an extraordinaryshowing. Furthermore, within each basket, serevices will be assigned toservice categories, the prices of which are subject to annual restrictionson upward and downward movements, as measured by SBIs.8. The first basket will consist of residential and small business services,divided into six service categories: (1) Domestic day; (2) Domestic evening;(3) Domestic night/weekend; (4) International MTS; (5) Operator and creditcard services; and (6) Reach Out America. ATandamp;T forfeits streamlinedtreatment if it raises the rates of the Domestic evening or Domestic night/weekendMTS service categories by more than 4 percent annually relative to thechange in the PCI, or if it raises any other service category in this basketby more than 5 percent per year relative to the PCI. ATandamp;T also forfeitsstreamlined treatment if it lowers rates for any service category in thebasket by more than 5 percent relative to the PCI. In addition, ATandamp;Tmust calculate an average residential rate from among the services in thebasket, and ensure that the average residential rate does not increaseby more than 1 percent per year after adjusting for changes in the PCI.9. The second basket consists of all 800 Services, divided into four servicecategories: (1) Readyline 800; (2) ATandamp;T 800; (3) Megacom 800; and (4)all other 800. The third basket consists of all remaining capped services,divided into seven service categories: (1) Pro America I, II, and III;(2) WATS; (3) Megacom; (4) SDN; (5) other switched; (6) voice grade privateline and below; and (7) other private line. Upper and lower bands of 5percent shall apply to each of the service categories in these baskets.Thus, rate increases or decreases that exceed 5 percent per year relativeto the PCI will not be afforded streamlined review.C. Operation of the Price Cap Index10. The price cap index, or PCI, is an index of change in the cost of factorsof production (<T3>i.e.,</T3> inflation), ATandamp;T productivity, and certain carrier-specificcost factors that are beyond ATandamp;T's control. The PCI for each basketof services acts as a ceiling above which that basket's index of actualprices_the API_cannot go without an extraordinary showing. Cost changesdue to the inflation and productivity components of the PCI formula arereflected in annual index adjustments. The inflation component is representedby the Gross National Product Price Index (GNP-PI), a broad-based indexof price changes in all sectors of the economy, published by the U.S. Departmentof Commerce. The productivity factor adjusts for the fact that ATandamp;T'sproductivity historically has exceeded that of the economy. We concludethat the productivity offset for ATandamp;T should be 2.5 percent. To ensurethat ratepayers benefit from price cap regulation, and share in the gainsfrom the efficiency improvements we expect will result from price cap regulation,we adjust the productivity offset upward by 0.5 percent, known as the ConsumerProductivity Dividend (CPD), to reach a total productivity factor of 3.0percent for use in the PCI formula.11. Price cap levels will also vary with changes in certain ``exogenous''costs, that is, costs which are beyond the control of ATandamp;T and whichaffect the telecommunications sector, rather than the economy as a whole.We treat as exogenous the following: changes in access charges paid byATandamp;T to the LECs; changes in interstate costs caused by changes inthe Separations Manual and the Uniform System of Accounts (USOA); changesin costs due to the completion of the amortization of depreciation reservedeficiencies; and changes in costs caused by reallocation of investmentfrom regulated to nonregulated activities pursuant to andSection; 64.901of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 64.901. ATandamp;T may request exogenoustreatment of changes in costs due to changes in the tax laws, or any othercost changes that are beyond ATandamp;T's control, and that affect ATandamp;T'scosts disproportionately relative to the economy as a whole.12. ATandamp;T must file adjustments to its PCIs each year in connectionwith its annual price cap tariff filing. In addition, ATandamp;T must updateits PCIs to account for mid-year exogenous costs changes. The PCI formulaprovides for price cap adjustments as follows:<ITAG tagnum="26">PCI<T2>t</T2>=PCI<T2>t^1</T2>[1+w(GNP-PI^X)+DY/R  +DZ/R]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">where</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">GNP-PI=the percentage change in the GNP-PI,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">X=productivity factor of 3.0%,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">DY=(new access rate_access rate at the time the PCI was updated toPCI<T2>t-1</T2>) x base period demand,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">DZ=the dollar effect of current regulatory changes, when comparedto the regulations in effect at the time the PCI was updated to PCI<T2>t-1</T2>, measured at base period level of operations,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">R=base period quantities for each rate element ``i,'' multiplied bythe price for each rate element ``i'' at the time the PCI was updated toPCI<T2>t-1</T2>,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">w=R_(access rates in effect at the time the PCI was updated to PCI<T2>t-1</T2> x base period demand) + DZ, all divided by R,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">PCI<T2>t</T2>=the new PCI value, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">PCI<T2>t-1</T2>=the immediately preceding PCI value.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The (GNP-PI^X) component will be the same for each basket, while the``DY'' and ``DZ'' variables will vary by basket, depending on the impactof regulatory changes and changes in access charges on the cost of providingthe particular services in each basket. The base period used in index adjustmentsis the 12-month period ending 6 months prior to the effective date of theannual price cap filing.13. In light of the important role we assign to the design and compositionof baskets in protecting consumers of MTS and other services over whichATandamp;T retains significant market power, it is essential that ATandamp;Tproperly allocate exogenous cost changes, including changes in access costs,among baskets. With respect to non-traffic sensitive access costs, ATandamp;Tmust first calculate the net change in such costs, at base period demand,associated with all of its capped services. ATandamp;T must then allocatethis amount among its baskets according to the proportion of total baseperiod non-traffic sensitive minutes of access (both originating and terminating)associated with each basket. Similarly, ATandamp;T must allocate the changein its total traffic sensitive access costs (calculated at base perioddemand) among baskets in proportion to their share of total base periodtraffic sensitive minutes. We require that changes in special access costs(calculated at base period demand) be assigned directly to the basketsin which those costs are incurred. With respect to exogenous cost changesreflected in the PCI's ``Z'' variable, we require that such changes beallocated on a cost causative basis.D. Comparing Rates to the PCI14. The actual price index, or API, measures the incremental change inthe aggregate price of each basket of services each time ATandamp;T proposesrate revisions. The API formula requires the summation of the weightedratios of proposed prices and existing prices, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="26">API<T2>t</T2>=API<T2>t-1</T2>[S<T2>i</T2>v<T2>i</T2>(p<T2>t</T2>/p<T2>t-1</T2>)<T2>i</T2>]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">where</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">API<T2>t</T2>=the proposed API value,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">API<T2>t-1</T2>=the existing API value,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">p<T2>t</T2>=the proposed price for rate element ``i,''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">p<T2>t-1</T2>=the existing price for rate element ``i,'' and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">v<T2>i</T2>=the current estimated revenue weight for rate element ``i,''calculated as the ratio of the base period demand for the rate element``i'' priced at the existing rate, to the base period demand for the entirebasket of services priced at existing rates.</ITAG>15. New services will be brought under price caps at the first annual pricecap tariff filing following the completion of the base period in whichthey become effective, and the API will be adjusted to reflect the impactof a new service on a basket's aggregate rates at that time. To make thisadjustment, the demand for the new service during the base period mustbe included in determining the weights used in calculating the API. Theproportional change between existing rates (including that of the new service)and proposed rates (including that of the new service), weighted accordingto base period demand and existing prices, is multiplied against the existingAPI value to produce the new API, which incorporates the new service. Forrestructured services, in its API calculation, ATandamp;T must convert existingrates into rates of equivalent value under the proposed structure, andthen compare the existing rates that have been converted to reflect restructuringto the proposed restructured rates.16. ATandamp;T must establish subindexes within each basket to measure themovement in the revenue-weighted aggregate prices of the groups of rateelements that comprise the banded service categories. Each such serviceband index, or SBI, shall be calculated by using essentially the same formulaas we are adopting for the API:<ITAG tagnum="26">SBI<T2>t</T2>=SBI<T2>t-1</T2>[S<T2>i</T2>v<T2>i</T2>(p<T2>t</T2>/p<T2>t-1)</T2><T2>i</T2>]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">where</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">SBI<T2>t</T2>=the proposed SBI value,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">SBI<T2>t-1</T2>=the existing SBI value,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">p<T2>t</T2>=the proposed price for rate element ``i,''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">p<T2>t-1</T2>=the existing price for rate element ``i,'' and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">v<T2>i</T2>=the current estimated revenue weight for rate element ``i,''calculated as the ratio of the base period demand for the rate element``i'' priced at the existing rate, to the base period demand for the entiregroup of rate elements comprising the service category priced at existingrates.</ITAG>E. Establishing Initial Index Values17. We conclude that reliance on ATandamp;T's existing rates is the mostreasonable option for initially determining compliance with the price capsystem. As a general matter, ATandamp;T is earning less than its authorizedrate of return. In addition, we have investigated nearly all of ATandamp;T'sexisting rates and concluded that they are not unlawful. Many of ATandamp;T'sexisting rates were set in the context of competitive pressure from othercarriers, which contributes to the reasonableness of using them as a startingpoint for price cap regulation. The use of existing rates as a startingpoint is the most expeditious means of generating the ratepayer benefitspromised by incentive regulation, and is a superior alternative to conductinga pre-price cap rate case. Finally, the operation of the price cap formulasand procedural mechanisms will exert downward pressure on the aggregateprices in each basket, and will produce price cap rates that will be withinthe zone of reasonableness.18. ATandamp;T's pre-price cap APIs and PCIs will be initialized with anassigned value of 100, corresponding to the rates and costs in effect onDecember 31, 1988, the last day of the pre-price cap base period. To theextent that costs change during the interim between December 31, 1988,and July 1, 1989, such changes must be reflected in the PCI formula adjustmentsthat are made in the initial price cap filing. The base period during thefirst price cap tariff year shall be the period from January 1, 1988, throughDecember 31, 1988.F. Evaluation of Price Cap Rates<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Annual Filings</ITAG>19. ATandamp;T is required to make annual filings demonstrating compliancewith the price cap rules. These filings shall be effective on 45 days'notice. Since LECs are required to file their annual access tariffs on90 days' notice, this schedule permits ATandamp;T to incorporate the costeffects of those filings in its own annual filing.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Within-Band Rate Level Changes</ITAG>20. Rate level changes that produce an API less than or equal to the PCI,and rates within applicable price bands, qualify for streamlined treatment.Tariffs proposing such rate level changes shall be filed on 14 days' notice,and will be presumed lawful. In lieu of traditional cost support, streamlinedfilings need be supported only by the calculations necessary to demonstratethat the proposed rates are within the limits set by the PCI and the pricinglimitations. Petitioners seeking suspension of a streamlined filing mustmeet a stringent four-part test. We require petitioners to demonstrate:(1) A high probability that the tariff would be found unlawful after investigation;(2) that suspension would not substantially harm other interested parties;(3) that irreparable injury would result if suspension did not issue; and(4) that suspension would not otherwise be contrary to the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Above-Band Rates</ITAG>21. We conclude that above-band rates raise questions about the distributionof rate increase burdens that require the fullest possible considerationby interested parties and by this Commission. Therefore, we require thatabove-band rates must be filed on 90 days' notice, with a likelihood ofsuspension. The justness and reasonableness of above-band rates will beassessed in light of the overall price cap scheme, and ATandamp;T will berequired to make a ``substantial cause'' showing, which will usually involvea detailed and specific cost justification of the proposed increase.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Above-Cap Rates</ITAG>22. Tariffs proposing above-cap rates shall be filed on 90 days' notice,will generally be suspended, and must be accompanied by cost support datademonstrating that the rates are just and reasonable. In its cost showing,ATandamp;T must assign costs to rate elements, or to the lowest possiblelevel, and make a detailed explanation of the reasons for the prices ofall rate elements to which it does not assign costs. In addition, ATandamp;Tmust explain the allocation of costs within each basket, and the allocationof costs among baskets.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Below-Band Rates</ITAG>23. We conclude that below-band rates may raise questions of predatoryactivity that are not suited to streamlined review. As a result, we requirethat tariffs proposing below-band rates must be filed on 45 days' notice,and must be accompanied by a showing that the rates cover the cost of serviceand are otherwise just and reasonable. For the purpose of initial reviewof such tariff filings, we adopt the average variable cost standard asa benchmark for determining whether a proposed rate decrease should beinvestigated and/or suspended. The average variable cost of a service must,at a minimum, include all access charges and billing and collection costsattributable to that service, as well as other non-fixed costs which wouldnot be incurred if the service were not offered.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. New and Restructured Services</ITAG>24. We conclude that new and restructured services must receive specialtreatment because they present possible means of avoiding price cap pricingrestrictions. The general principle for distinguishing between new andrestructured services is that new services add to the range of optionsavailable to customers, while restructured services simply represent rearrangementsof existing services. New services will be outside the cap initially. Tariffsproposing new services should be filed on 45 days' notice, with supportinginformation and data to demonstrate compliance with a net revenue test.Under this test, a new service, and each unbundled element thereof, mustbe projected to increase ATandamp;T's net revenues for services subject toprice cap regulation within the lesser of 24 months from the incorporationof the service into an annual price cap filing, or 36 months from the effectivedate of the service. ATandamp;T must include new services in the cap in thefirst annual price cap tariff filing after the completion of the base yearin which the new service becomes effective.25. Tariffs proposing restructured services are much more likely to raiseissues of discrimination than tariffs proposing only rate level changes.We therefore conclude that tariffs proposing restructured rates must befiled on 45 days' notice. ATandamp;T will be required to demonstrate continuedcompliance with both the PCI and the bands.G. Effect of Incentive Regulation on Existing Commission Policies26. Under price cap regulation, we will retain existing Commission policiesand rules that foster competition and prevent discrimination, and othermarket rules and implementing regulations. Furthermore, this Commissioncontinues to be committed to geographic rate averaging. We conclude thatin implementing price cap regulation for ATandamp;T, we have taken no actionthat would put geographic rate averaging at risk. We find it unnecessaryat this time explicitly to prohibit rate deaveraging through the exerciseof our rulemaking authority. However, given our strong commitment to geographicallyaveraged rates as a tool to promote universal service, we pledge to subjectproposals by ATandamp;T to deaverage rates to the full 90-day notice periodpermitted by section 203 of the Communications Act, and to suspend suchfilings for the full five-month period permitted by section 204 of theAct. In the course of the resulting investigation, ATandamp;T would bearthe burden of justifying the proposal to deaverage rates.27. We also conclude that the implementation of price cap regulation willbe enhanced by the continuation of existing market rules, implementingregulations, such as Open Network Architecture (ONA) and the joint costrules, and the USOA and separations rules. We will also retain existingcomplaint procedures. We conclude that the Interim Cost Allocation Manual(ICAM) should be discontinued because it requires fully distributed costingbetween broad service categories, and would therefore be inconsistent withthe price cap system we have devised. We will continue to enforce the Part63 rules regarding extension of lines and discontinuance of service. Weretain our current Part 65 rules with certain modifications, includingan exemption for ATandamp;T from targeting its rates to a prescribed rateof return, and a requirement that ATandamp;T file an annual rate of returnreport of its total interstate rate of return.H. Monitoring and Performance Review28. During the initial four years of price cap regulation, we will monitorATandamp;T's performance, with particular attention to its prices, earnings,quality of service, and technological progressiveness. ATandamp;T will fileARMIS reports on a quarterly basis, including information on: revenues,expenses, and taxes for purposes of tracking cost allocations between regulatedand non-regulated activities; revenues and expenses by state and interstatejurisdictions; and switched messages, conversation minutes, and accessminutes. In addition, we continue to require ATandamp;T to file Form 492,which contains information on revenues, investment, expenses, and the earnedrate of return, but we will require that information to be filed on a totalinterstate basis only. We will also continue to collect semi-annual reportson quality of service, and will continue to scrutinize the informationATandamp;T files in connection with its annual section 214 authorizationapplication.29. In addition to monitoring price cap regulation through the collectionof data, our review of tariffs, and the complaint process, we will reviewATandamp;T's performance in a comprehensive manner beginning at the end ofthe third year from the inaugural date of price cap regulation. The reviewwill be completed before the end of the fourth year of price caps. Shouldit become apparent to us before this review that the price cap programis not achieving its goals, we will initiate an earlier review. The performancereview will consist of a comprehensive examination of the effects of pricecap regulation, and will consider all available measures of market andcarrier performance, including, but not limited to, actual prices, achievedrate of return, quality of service, and technological progressiveness.Underachievement or overachievement with respect to any measures of performancerelated to price cap regulation may result in changes to the productivityoffset or other adjustments. Finally, we conclude that no retroactive paymentsshould be exacted from ATandamp;T for its productivity gains under pricecaps, as such retroactive treatment would unduly diminish ATandamp;T's incentiveto exceed an established target.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Legal Authority </ITAG>30. We conclude that our price cap plan for ATandamp;T is within our statutoryauthority, and that based on the administrative record established in thisproceeding, adoption of price cap rules is in the public interest, as definedin the Communications Act and relevant judicial precedent. The CommunicationsAct does not compel us to employ rate of return regulation, or any otherparticular regulatory model, in carrying out our statutory mandate, butrather provides this Commission with an array of regulatory powers andbroad discretion to determine how best to use them in the public interest.Our broad discretion extends to selecting methods to make and oversee rates.Ultimately, the substantive mandate under which we operate requires onlythat we select a ratemaking approach that is capable of keeping rates inthe zone of reasonableness, or of detecting and correcting for the failureof market forces to do so. The price cap plan for ATandamp;T fulfills theCommunications Act's substantive requirement of ensuring just, reasonable,and non-discriminatory rates, and does so in a cautious, evolutionary manner.31. Notwithstanding that our price cap system continues to monitor andconsider profit levels to ensure that they are not excessive, it is alsoa system designed to permit greater earnings flexibility than a strictrate of return regime. This design is based upon the fundamental premiseunderlying incentive regulation and the benefits it will produce for ratepayers_thatit is the potential to increase earnings that drives companies to improvetheir efficiency. We believe this approach to rate regulation is fullyconsistent with our statutory mandate to ensure just and reasonable rates.32. We are implementing price caps through the establishment of suspensionand no-suspension zones, and through modifications to our current tarifffiling procedures. A decision by this Commission to permit a tariff totake effect without suspension is an exercise of this Commission's discretionaryauthority, and constitutes a preliminary decision within our exclusivediscretion. Pursuant to this discretionary suspension power, we may establishguidelines expressing a tentative opinion about the location of the linebetween reasonable and unreasonable rates. This Commission need not prescriberates in order to establish no-suspension zones. Moreover, we concludethat our price cap rules do not constitutes <T3>de facto </T3>rate prescription without the required hearing. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis </ITAG>33. On June 14, 1988, after the release of the <T3>Further Notice </T3>in this proceeding, this Commission requested thatthe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review the proposed informationcollection requirements for compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Actof 1980. On August 15, 1988, OMB commented on this Commission's proposedinformation collection requirements. OMB stated that the <T3>Further Notice </T3>failed to demonstrate the practical utility ofsome of the reporting requirements proposed in this Commission's request,and found that the information collections were not the minimum necessaryto meet the objectives of the proposed rules. In commenting on this Commission'srequest, OMB listed a series of concerns that it asked this Commissionto address. ATandamp;T is currently the only carrier subject to price capregulation. Therefore, the price cap information collection requirementscontained in this Report and Order are not subject to the requirementsof section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended (44U.S.C. 3507).
