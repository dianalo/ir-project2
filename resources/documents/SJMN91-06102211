Eschewing extraneousdetails and gimmicks, he is content to pare away until all that is left is acloth sculpture that is eminently wearable.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  KLEIN EMPHASIZES UNDERSTATEMENT IN AGELESSCOLLECTION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Cover StoryFall Fashion PreviewSee also related article on page 3D of this section.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Klein's personal vision of fall is pale. Colors are understated and thevery few prints in his collection are subtle paisleys, jacquards or foulards.Even his evening satins are pale peridot green or gold and his beading is morematte than flash.;    For daytime, Klein offers toasty knit tunics that flaretoward their midthigh hem, worn over matching tights in a deep mahogany red orblack. They look both comfortable and, if you've got the legs, very chic.;   There are also what Klein calls &quot;jacket dresses,&quot; which are a lighter versionof the coat dress; short skirts with a slight drape in front; wrap skirts;velvet stretch pants; cuffed trousers and cardigan jackets.;    Klein shinesafter dark with a series of short, matte crepe shifts that skim the body; laceslip dresses with no linings; several beaded dresses in T-shirt and slipstyles; and some beaded coats with matching, slim pants. Evening colors aremetallic silver, gold, copper or bronze.;    While Klein's collection for falladded up to 95 separate outfits and many, many ideas, relative newcomerChristian Francis Roth presented 39 outfits and two themes.;    Roth devotedthe first half of his show to hobo-inspired patches. In his program notes,Roth writes, &quot;If a hobo has a suit with holes, he patches it up. If a womangets a hole in her jacket, why shouldn't she patch it? Or get one from me,pre-patched?&quot; The difference between the patching a hobo might do and thepainstaking piecing together of contrasting materials that Roth does is asmuch a contrast as a night in a boxcar to a night in the Biltmore.;    Thesecond part of Roth's collection is inspired by Amish quilts. Using both thesubdued tones of real Amish quilts and some brighter colors, he recreatesquilt patterns such as Diamond in the Square, Checkerboard, Zig-Zag and Barsin large shawls and as border patterns on dresses and skirts.;    The red,purple and aqua skirt in a Tumbling Blocks quilt pattern with zig-zag hem iseye-popping. Also striking are ankle-length circle skirts in a Lone Star orBars quilt pattern.;    Roth accessorizes some jackets with wool scarves,again in quilt patterns, that are just plain pretty. Expect to see a smartscarf manufacturer join this quilting bee in a hurry.;    Other designers withfall collections worth noting include:;     Eleanor P. Brenner;  EleanorBrenner's sporty EPB Easy label includes the liberal use of zippers andstretch fabrics, particularly in stirrup pants and leggings. For fun there aresome themed sweaters, jackets and dresses with hearts and kisses or casinogambling chips.;    The more serious Eleanor P. Brenner Ltd. label takesmenswear fabrics and feminizes them by using clear sequins to createpinstripes on a tweed blazer or lace overlays on the hem of a cardiganjacket.;    Brenner also likes the look of long, lean jackets with straightskirts peeking out an inch or two below the jacket hem; a sporty V-neck tennissweater trimmed in sequins worn over a short sequin skirt; and the look oftussah silk in narrow pants, bandeau tops, jackets and dresses.;    JenniferGeorge;  A key part of Jennifer George's fall line is a group of trompe l'oeiljackets that deceive the eye -- they look like two or three layers ofclothing, even though they are one-piece affairs.;    Standouts from Georgeinclude a sumptuous coral ribbed tunic sweater with a wrap collar; short,fringed wrap skirts and kilts; and what the designer calls a &quot;stocking pant,&quot;which is a little more than tights and a little less than pants. George'scombination of gray flannel trousers and a gold sequin jacket for evening isinnovative.;    Randolph Duke;  Like many, many other designers, Randolph Dukehas succumbed to tartan fever -- particularly the Black Watch, which he usesto create kilt skirts, split to the waist in front. Much more wearable is aseries of coats that reverse from gray flannel to metallic-finish plastic inbright red, green or gold.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARY GOTTSCHALK, Mercury News Style Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New York  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910411  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  760  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday April 11, 199100102211,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
