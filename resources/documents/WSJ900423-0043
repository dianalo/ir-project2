Draft specifications circulating among traders containdetails of a 1,000-barrel Dubai crude contract that couldbegin trading this summer, dealers say.</LP><TEXT>   It is a logical step following soaring volumes of NorthSea Brent oil futures and options, says Christopher Bellew,head of the energy division at C. Czarnikow Ltd., Londoncommodity merchants.   However, the market for Dubai crude is relatively small,he points out. Dubai crude is produced at a rate of 350,000barrels a day, Mr. Bellew says, which is equivalent to amonthly tally of 19 cargoes, each containing half a millionbarrels of oil. By comparison, the North Sea fields cansupply 40 cargoes a month.   Dubai petroleum is similar to Iranian and other &quot;sour,&quot; orhigh-sulfide, crude oil that is produced in the Middle East,Mr. Bellew says, so the contract should be popular.   &quot;OPEC won't be able to ignore the contract; it will be avisible price for a key, Middle Eastern crude oil,&quot; saysPeter Gignoux, director of Shearson Lehman Hutton'sinternational energy department. He hopes that more MiddleEastern producers will deal in London.   Spot Dubai oil traded at $13.80 a barrel Friday, against$17.90 for the &quot;sweet,&quot; low-sulfide Brent oil and $17.95 forWest Texas Intermediate.   The proposed new contract would make its debut following ayear in which volumes exceeded the most optimisticexpectations of the International Petroleum Exchange,officials say. With prices volatile, Brent oil futuresaveraged around 14,000 contracts a day this month, says PeterWildblood, chief executive of the exchange.   This is double the daily average of last year and morethan three times the levels in 1988, the year in which thecontract was resuscitated, he says. Each Brent crude contractis for 1,000 barrels, or about 42,000 gallons.   Trading in heating oil has also soared, Mr. Wildbloodsays, but a heavy fuel contract, which opened trade lastyear, is disappointing; the exchange is looking for ways toattract interest. Besides the Dubai contract, the exchange isconsidering introducing a naptha or gasoline contract.   Such has been the growth of the International PetroleumExchange that it is taking a growing share of theinternational oil trade. Last year, for example, volumes inBrent futures were only 8% of the dealings in West TexasIntermediate on the much larger New York Mercantile Exchange.In the past few weeks, the proportion has risen to around 14%of New York's daily average of 100,000 contracts a day.   Meanwhile, dealings in London's heating oil contract roseto an average of around 8,500 contracts a day from 6,000 in1988, the exchange says. Although it is a slightly smallerinstrument than its U.S. counterpart, its volumes are now athird of the levels on the New York exchange, up from 25%three years ago.   Trading surged since the London exchange abandoned alunchtime break and extended trading hours until 8 p.m., Mr.Wildblood says. Some dealers still complain about the longerhours, he says, but most exchange members appreciate thatalmost 40% of the London trade occurs from late afternoononward when the New York market is active.   Increasing numbers of U.S. traders are making use of theLondon market, Mr. Wildblood says, but better volumes arealso benefiting the New York Exchange. Such &quot;Wall Streetrefiners&quot; as J. Aron andamp; Co., a division of Goldman Sachs andamp;Co., Phibro Energy, a unit of Salomon Inc., and MorganStanley Group account for a high proportion of London trade,dealers say.   As a result of buoyant conditions, prices of seats on theInternational Petroleum Exchange have jumped to around$260,000 from $80,000 two years ago. There are now 42&quot;locals,&quot; or trading-floor speculators, at the exchange, Mr.Wildblood says, although producers, refiners, professionaltraders and distributors still account for 70% to 80% ofdealings.   The Brent contract is attracting more European playersbecause it is an international benchmark crude, says LaurentChatenay, futures trading manager at ICI Chemical andamp; PolymersLtd. He says his firm is reducing dealings in U.S. oilfutures, which are more suitable for North Americans.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Livestock and Meats                                                                                                          Prices of cattle futures contracts might come underdownward pressure at the open of trading today in the wake ofa government report showing that the flow of young cattleonto feedlots in March didn't slow as much as expected.   After the close of trading Friday, the AgricultureDepartment said that the number of young cattle placed ontofeedlots in seven major ranching states in March fell 4% fromMarch 1989. Livestock analysts had expected the department toreport a 10% drop. Feedlots fatten livestock for slaughter.   The department reported that the number of cattle onfeedlots in the seven states rose 3% instead of the 2% risethat had been expected.   The department also released a quarterly survey offeedlots in 13 states. The report was generally in line withexpectations, showing that the number of cattle on feedlotson April 1 rose 1% from the same date in 1989.   In the report, the department projected that sales byfeedlots in the 13 states to slaughterhouses could rise 1%from the same 1989 quarter. The projection signals that theslaughter could hit a record for any second quarter.                                                                                                          Copper                                                                                                          Futures prices fell sharply Friday, dropping 4.05 cents apound to $1.1255. Further declines are expected even thoughnew fundamental developments are lacking.   Traders apparently viewed the return of striking workersat one Peruvian mine as a sign that the separate six-week-oldminers' and smelter workers' strike in that country may soonend. Statistics indicating the U.S. economy is more sluggishthan at the beginning of the year also are worrying traders,analysts said.   Traders will be keenly watching today's London MetalExchange's report on copper stocks. Estimates range forincreases of anywhere from 5,000 tons to as much as 12,000.   Despite all this, Fred Demler, metals economist forPaineWebber in New York, noted the Peruvian strike stillhasn't been settled and a major Chilean mine that recentlyhad a production disruption still is working at only 60% ofits capacity. Production losses may amount to as much as25,000 tons of refined copper, as a result, he said. Chile isthe world's top copper producer.   In the futures market, Mr. Demler noted, the price drophasn't been as severe as it might seem. &quot;After all, the pricerose from below 95 cents in January to $1.25 in early April.It's only given up about 10 cents or so of that in what hasto be regarded as a fair correction.&quot;   Copper supplies are still tight and dealer prices in theU.S., Japan and Europe remain high, he noted. Also,soonest-to-expire months in London and New York futuresmarkets are higher priced than more deferred ones, he noted.&quot;If supplies were really more ample, the premiums in the cashmarket would be sharply lower. In the futures markets, thepremiums would have disappeared,&quot; he said.                                                                                                          Coffee                                                                                                          Futures prices rose Friday but the prospect of increasedBrazilian shipments of coffee limited the advance and maycontinue to weigh on the market.   A major factor contributing to the price advance was therapid absorption of 1,054 notices to deliver coffee againstMay contracts, analysts said. Friday was the first day forthe issuance of such notices.   The quick acceptance of such a large number of notices bydealers generated the perception that demand for immediatelyavailable supplies of coffee remains very strong and futuresprices rose, said Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson LehmanHutton, New York.   However, Ms. Kaul noted, prices later partially fell backand the general impression was that, with Brazilian exportsof coffee having resumed, supplies that have been backloggedin that country will soon be finding their way on to theworld market.</TEXT></DOC>
