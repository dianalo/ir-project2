Communist Yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics andtwo autonomous provinces, with many nationalities and differingethnic populations. The regions have grown increasingly restivesince the death in 1980 of Josip Tito, founder of the modernYugoslav state in 1945.   Tito's charisma was credited as a major force in bindingYugoslavia together and submerging the regional tensions thatsurfaced after his death.   Liberal and prosperous Slovenia, where multiparty democracy isbeing established, and the Serbian leadership, which advocatescontinued Communist rule and a strongly centralized federal system,have a history of disputes.   Yugoslav politicians and news media were deeply divided overSerbia's decision, announced Wednesday, to break off all governmentand business contacts with Slovenia.   Some Western diplomats described Serbia's move as a possiblefirst step toward disintegration of the fractious Yugoslavfederation.   Serbia acted after Slovenia banned a mass protest rally by Serbnationalists in Ljubljana, the Slovene capital.   The demonstration, orchestrated by the Serbian government, wasscheduled for Friday in an apparent attempt by Serbia'sconservative Communist politicians to topple Slovenia's reformistleadership.   Sinigoj said that ``threats of destructive marches, the fanningof nationalist passions and demands for replacement of legallyelected (officials) cannot achieve'' the democratization ofYugoslavia.   ``The instigators of such actions must be stopped.''   Serbia's break in relations appears to be the culmination of along campaign against Slovenia and of its repeated informalattempts to achieve an economic boycott on that republic.   Slovenian politicians believe Serbian leaders want to imposetheir ideological orthodoxy on all of Yugoslavia.   Serbs from southern Kosovo province, who were to havespearheaded the rally, denounced the ban as ``fascist-like.''Serbian officials elsewhere called it ``a brutal ... anti-Serbianand anti-Yugoslav act of Slovenia's ruling clique.''   But a radio report in Croatia, another northern region that hassupported Slovenia's reforms, said ``Slovenia has demonstrated howa state based on the rule of law should function, and therefore itis extremely cynical to accuse it of fascism.''   Croatia's influential Vjesnik newspaper wrote that Serbia's``diabolic plan ... has been thwarted by the decisiveness andfirmness of the Slovene leadership, with the support of the vastmajority of Yugoslavia's citizens.''   Police checked vehicles Thursday to stop Serbians from reachingLjubljana.   The Slovene capital was virtually deserted. Most residents wentto nearby Alpine resorts for a two-day holiday marking the 46thanniversary of the establishment of Yugoslavia as a Communist state.</TEXT></DOC>
