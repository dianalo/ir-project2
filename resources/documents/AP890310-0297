DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge who has temporarily barredcommuter railroad workers from honoring Eastern Airlines strikers'picket lines has extended his order until he renders a finaldecision.   U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. extended hisself-imposed Friday midnight deadline indefinitely, until he ruleson whether it is legal for railroad workers to strike in sympathywith airlines workers.   Patterson gave no indication how long the temporary restrainingorder would remain in effect or when he would issue a writtenopinion on the complex labor dispute.   His secretary, Kathleen Howley, said Patterson on Friday decidedto extend the deadline because the transcript of two days ofhearings he conducted was not immediately available and electricalpower in Manhattan's federal courthouse would be off for severalhours on Saturday for testing purposes.   ``I hope to render an opinion as soon as possible,'' Pattersontold lawyers for both sides at the end of the second day of hearingson Thursday, but gave no indication when that might be.   Less than an hour after strikebound Eastern filed for Chapter 11protection from creditors, Patterson heard competing legal argumentsfrom lawyers for four metropolitan area railroads and the unionsthat represent their workers.   The unions claim that federal law allows secondary picketing inthe railroad and airline industries.   But the railroads maintain that the law requires their employeesto stay on the job until they go through a series of mandatedarbitration steps.   On Sunday, at the request of the railroads, Patterson barredworkers at the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North and New JerseyTransit from honoring the picket lines of Eastern strikers.   Patterson later extended the temporary restraining order toAmtrak workers.   Eastern machinists had said they might set up picket lines at therailroads as part of their strike but have not done so yet.   ``This could bring the city to an absolute standstill,'' thejudge said near the end of Wednesday's session.   Earlier Wednesday, the unions urged a federal appeals court tooverturn Patterson's order but the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsdeclined to intervene until the lower court made a determination.   In two days of lengthy hearings, Patterson heard railroadofficials testify that they would be forced to shut down if theirworkers honored Eastern strikers' picket lines.   The unions will not concede that point and maintain that theywill only ``urge and encourage'' their members to honor picket lines_ not order them to do so.</TEXT></DOC>
