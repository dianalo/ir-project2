that replaced an X-MP/22 installed in1983, which replaced the centre's original 1978 vintage Cray-1A; value of theorder was not given.andM;- o -andM;The San Diego Supercomputer Center has just installed a Cray Y-MP 8/864 andreckons that it is the most powerful supercomputer currently available: thecentre is also proud of the fact that it is the first research facility westof the Mississippi to get a Y-MP 8/864.andM;- o -andM;VEB Kombinat Robotron, the leading computer manufacturer in the Comeconcountries, has not been immune from the exodus from East Germany: getting onfor 1,000 of its 68,000 employees - skilled ones, of course - were among thearmy of defectors that have settled in the Federal Republic in the past fewmonths.andM;- o -andM;Northern Telecom Ltd's Australian division Nortel is to supply Australia'sfirst international Integrated Services Digital Network, after a $12mcontract signed with the Overseas Telecommunications Commission Ltd: Nortelwill be supplying the 12,000 line exchange operating at 64Kbps and usingexisting digital telephone exchanges, as well as an associated internationaltransmission centre; due to begin with connections to the US and Japan early1990, it is expected to benefit customers with international private networksand large data and facsimile needs.andM;- o -andM;GEC Plc has got off fairly lightly in the chorus of criticism over London'sDocklands Light Railway - well you build the thing to a spec and to a price,and it's hardly your fault if both were inadequate in the first place - butthe new notices appearing on the railway seem only reminiscent of BritishRail's &quot;We're getting there&quot; counsel of despair: &quot;Born 1987, still goingstrong,&quot; they say, and the Daily Telegraph's City Diarist notes with feelingthat passengers are finding it hard to resist the temptation to change themessage to &quot;Born 1987, still going &quot;wrong&quot;.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
