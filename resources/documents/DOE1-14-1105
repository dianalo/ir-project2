CT improved the detectionof comminuted fractures of the orbital bones, specifying the nature offractures, their extent and a degree of displacement of fragments. CTpermitted high-quality diagnosis of injuries of eye and orbital softtissue components, assessment of their condition, the volume and degreeof hemorrhages, the detection of low-contrast FB, the specification ofthei site, and the interrelationships with eyeball and orbital structures.</TEXT></DOC>
