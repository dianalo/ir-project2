Republicans and Democratsare arguing about all three in the aftermath of the DanQuayle-Lloyd Bentsen debate.   Each side accused the other vice presidential hopeful of playingfast and loose with the facts in Wednesday night's encounter.   A Republican truth squad put out a six-page analysis of``Bentsen Distortions and Errors'' on Thursday, while Democratsconfined themselves to five pages on ``Dan Quayle's FactualMistakes.''   In less polite parlance, that means lies on such subjects asSocial Security, poverty and just how well Quayle knows Europeanleaders.   Here is a look at some of the points in dispute:</TEXT><HEAD>POVERTY</HEAD><TEXT>   Quayle said, ``Poverty hasn't gone up in this administration. Ithasn't gone down much either.'' The Census Bureau says that in1980, 13 percent of the U.S. population, or 29.3 million people,were living in poverty. The rate rose to 14 percent, or 31.8million people, in 1981, Reagan's first year in office, peaked at15.2 percent or 35.3 million in 1983, then gradually dropped backto 13.5 percent, or 32.5 million, in 1987, the latest yearavailable.   Measured since 1980, the poverty rate is up by one-halfpercentage point; measured since 1981, it is down by that much. Ineither case the actual number of poor people is up, since thepopulation has grown.</TEXT><HEAD>SOCIAL SECURITY</HEAD><TEXT>   When Bentsen charged that Quayle ``voted eight times to cut thebenefits on Social Security,'' the Republican fired back, ``Youknow that I did not vote to cut Social Security benefits eighttimes. What I have voted for and what Senator Bentsen has voted foris to delay the cost-of-living adjustments.'' He said Bentsen, too,had twice voted for freezes, and that Michael Dukakis took asimilar position at a governors' conference.   Mark Gearan, a Dukakis spokesman, did not dispute those votes,but said Quayle ``doesn't understand that freezing or delaying theCOLA cuts benefits. ... The bottom line is smaller checks.''</TEXT><HEAD>PACS and HONORARIA</HEAD><TEXT>   Bentsen, asked about being the Senate's biggest recipient ofpolitical action committee money _ $1.5 million for his Senatere-election campaign, said, ``I don't find it embarrassing atall.'' He said his $10,000-a-place ``breakfast club'' for lobbyistswas ``a real doozy'' of a mistake, but ``perfectly legal, and youhave all kinds of such clubs on the Hill.''   But Bentsen's $10,000-a-seat club was considered unusual,although other congressional leaders do arrange regular briefingsand entrees for favored donors.   Bentsen, who accepts no speaking fees, charged that Quayle has``collected over a quarter of a million dollars of honorariums now,speaking to various interest groups.''   Quayle's camp said he donated almost $20,000 of his honoraria tocharity in 1986 and $14,302 in 1987. Senate rules prohibit senatorsfrom keeping speech fees above 30 percent of their salary.</TEXT><HEAD>ENVIRONMENT</HEAD><TEXT>   Quayle apparently mixed up his CFCs and CO2 when he praisedReagan administration efforts to grapple with the ozone problem.``For the first time, we are talking about the impact of C02 to theozone layer,'' he said.   But CO2 _ carbon dioxide _ does not deplete the ozone layer;chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, do. Carbon dioxide does add to theglobal warming phenomenon known as the ``greenhouse effect'' _another environmental problem.</TEXT><HEAD>BOSTON HARBOR</HEAD><TEXT>   After Quayle said Dukakis did ``virtually nothing'' to clean upBoston Harbor, ``the dirtiest waterway in America,'' Bentsencharged that a Reagan veto of a clean water bill had ``made itimpossible to move ahead at that time on Boston Harbor.''   But Dukakis dragged his feet on the cleanup back in 1978, thefinal year of his first term as governor, when he prepared anapplication to the Environmental Protection Agency seeking a waiverfrom the 1972 Clean Water Act requiring secondary treatment ofsewage being pumped into the harbor.   His successor completed the application in 1979. By the time theEPA rejected it in May 1983, Dukakis was governor again. Undercourt pressure, Dukakis and the state legislature created a publicauthority to undertake the $6 billion cleanup _ without the 75percent federal funding available in the 1970s.</TEXT><HEAD>FOREIGN AFFAIRS</HEAD><TEXT>   Quayle said, ``I've been to Geneva many times to meet with ournegotiators as we are hammering out the INF treaty. I've met withthe Western political leaders _ Margaret Thatcher, Chancellor Kohl.I know them. They know me.''   According to a visitor's log kept by U.S. officials in Geneva,Quayle made only one visit to the Swiss city during the nearly fouryears the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty was undernegotiation. That was in February 1987.   He also visited Geneva last Feb. 7-8 and met again with U.S.arms control negotiators, but that was two months after the treatywas signed.   Jeff Nesbitt, a Quayle spokesman, said he believed the senatormet Helmut Kohl when the West German chancellor stopped by a dinnerQuayle had with Kohl's chief of staff at a conference of NATOleaders in Munich a year or so ago.   Nesbitt said he knew of at least one meeting with Thatcher: LastJuly when the British prime minister attended a dinner withsenators on a visit to Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
