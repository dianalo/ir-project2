ShererandM;LAS VEGAS -- High-level IBM and Microsoft Corp. executives will meet at somepoint over the next few weeks in an attempt to break a deadlock in talks overthe amount of royalty payments IBM owes Microsoft.andM;The officials hope to mediate a dispute that other players from the two firmshave been unable to settle.andP;  Both companies are seeking to avoid a longroyalty battle that could end up in court and add more confusion for userstrying to decide between Windows and OS/2.andM;IBM's team includes Fernand Sarrat, former vice president of thesoon-to-be-disbanded IBM Desktop Software unit; Joseph Guglielmi, vicepresident and general manager of marketing and business development for IBM'sPersonal Systems division; and an unnamed IBM lawyer, sources said.andM;Microsoft President Mike Hallman will lead his firm's delegation, which willalso include an attorney and a business manager, they said.andM;The meeting's date has not been finalized, the sources said.andM;Microsoft and IBM officials last week confirmed that there is a desire totone down the personal invective between the firms.andP;  &quot;I think executivemanagement at both companies stopped and said, `This has gotten a bitpersonal,'&quot; said Steve Ballmer, senior vice president of Microsoft's SystemsDivision.andP;  &quot;Attacks on Bill Gates don't benefit any of our customers.&quot;andM;One participant in the talks cautioned last week, however, that the impassewill probably take more than one meeting to resolve.andM;In the BeginningandM;The dispute began when IBM announced in April plans to put Windows 3.0 codedirectly into OS/2 2.0 so OS/2 can run Windows applications.andP;  The existingcontract specifies that IBM owes Microsoft royalties for each copy of Windowsor OS/2 it sells; because IBM has added Windows code to OS/2 2.0, Microsoftis demanding additional royalties.andM;An IBM official said the contract already includes Windows support in OS/2.andO;&quot;OS/2 comes with that in its definition,&quot; said James Cannavino, IBM vicepresident and general manager of Personal Systems in Somers, N.Y.andM;Ballmer disagreed.andP;  &quot;If they andlsqb;IBMandrsqb; offer both products to a customer, theypay for both products,&quot; he said.andP;  Ballmer said Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash.,andO;is not seeking double royalties, but wants more than the base OS/2 royalties.andM;Given the sizable sums IBM has spent on its OS/2 marketing campaign, at leastone analyst believes the firm's margins on OS/2 are already slim and would beworse if it is forced to pay more royalties.andM;&quot;There is no profit margin on OS/2,&quot; said Rick Sherlund, an analyst atGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co., an investment bank in New York.andP;  &quot;They're incurringhuge losses on it.&quot; He estimated IBM will owe Microsoft at least $20 inroyalties for each $195 copy of OS/2 2.0 it sells.andM;Officials from both companies agree that IBM has rights to distribute theforthcoming Windows 3.1 and Windows NT, but not revisions of Windows thatMicrosoft releases after a certain undisclosed number of years.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
