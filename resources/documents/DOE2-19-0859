A method for stydying the vacuum magnetic configuration in stellaratorscan thus be based on simple measurements of the current drawn from asource of electrons moving in the stellarator by the vacuum chamber orby an additional transparent conducting grid spanning the magnetic-confinementregion. The characteristics of a ''stellarator diode'' and of a ''stellaratordiode with an auxiliary grid anode'' in the case of a moving point cathodehave been studied. A procedure for studying the magnetic surfaces insome fusion devices, the Uragan-2 stellarator and the Uragan-3 torsatron,has also been studied. The method proposed in this paper for studyingthe magnetic surfaces in a stellarator does not require searching forthe wake of an electron bunch, as is required in, for example, techniquesinvolving a pulsed electron beam. The measurement time is accordinglyshorter by more than an order of magnitude. This method has been usedat the Uragan-3 torsatron to optimize the magnetic configuration by varyingthe transverse magnetic field of the torsatron.</TEXT></DOC>
