The KKR tender offer stops just short of being an outright hostile bid, because it is conditioned on a friendly merger accord with RJR, among other things. KKR, a New York leveraged buy-out firm, and a group that includes RJR management and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. are competing in attempts to buy out the Atlanta-based tobacco and food giant. The offer is designed to get the jump on other prospective bidders, while increasing pressure on RJR management and Shearson to negotiate.    KKR is seeking 87% of RJR common stock at $90 a share. Completion of the offer is conditioned on the availability of financing and approval by RJR's board of a definitive merger agreement. The move sharply escalates a series of aggressive tactics that KKR generally has used in recent months.    The RJR-Shearson group, meanwhile, was understood to be seeking major partners to help finance its $17.6 billion bid for all of RJR. Last night, Wall Street sources confirmed that Forstmann Little andamp; Co., the second-largest LBO firm after KKR, has entered into talks with Shearson about a major multibillion-dollar investment in the Shearson-backed offer. The involvement of Forstmann Little head Theodore Forstmann, an archrival of KKR and an outspoken critic of its tactics, could spark a major battle among buy-out firms.    Speculation about additional investors involved Shearson's parent, American Express Co., and Nippon Life Insurance Co., Osaka, Japan, which has a major interest in Shearson.    RJR and Shearson officials were meeting long into the night to plot their countermove to the KKR bid. They had been anticipating the launching of their own offer by the end of the week, but may try to accelerate it now.    The talks between KKR and the RJR-Shearson group stretched past 3 a.m. EDT yesterday in the building that houses the New York offices of KKR and RJR. The negotiators periodically discussed a variety of compromise buy-outs in which all three parties would invest.    Active participants included KKR's Henry Kravis and George Roberts; RJR's chief executive officer, F. Ross Johnson; Shearson's chief executive, Peter A. Cohen, and merger chief J. Tomilson Hill; and American Express Chairman James Robinson, a close friend of RJR's Mr. Johnson.    Reached last night, a KKR spokesman said: &quot;We are disappointed that Ross Johnson didn't join us, but we're going ahead with the offer anyway.&quot; The aide added that the tender offer put KKR in &quot;a better competitive position.&quot;    Early in the talks, several participants said, KKR offered Shearson a &quot;kill fee&quot; of $125 million if Shearson would back out and allow KKR to work with RJR senior management. But Shearson executives told Mr. Kravis they were &quot;personally insulted&quot; by the offer. Shearson officials viewed the proposal as a payoff to allow Mr. Kravis to achieve his previously acknowledged goal of protecting &quot;his franchise&quot; in the buy-out business.    &quot;We were astounded,&quot; added an RJR adviser. &quot;It was almost inconceivable to us that Henry failed to comprehend that Shearson and management were one and the same. It would be like Shearson Lehman trying to divide Henry Kravis and George Roberts.&quot;    A KKR spokesman denied KKR offered Shearson money to leave the deal. He said various &quot;normal investment banking fees&quot; were discussed as part of Shearson's joining the KKR team. &quot;We don't consider that a kill fee,&quot; the spokesman said.    Events leading to the talks' dissolution were marked as much by differences in style as in business plans, especially as perceived by RJR executives. At one critical juncture -- in what could ultimately prove to be one of merger history's most unfortunate gaffes -- KKR's Mr. Roberts alienated many of the tobacco giant's top executives by making what the RJR camp construed as an anti-smoking remark.    &quot;It was an amazing thing to say, considering the subject matter,&quot; said one RJR aide.    According to people familiar with the talks, the negotiations began with a meeting between RJR's Mr. Johnson and KKR officials. While KKR's $90-a-share offer is $15 a share more than the RJR-Shearson group's, KKR officials badly want Mr. Johnson's management team to join them to continue guiding RJR.    &quot;Ross was prepared to see if there wasn't something that KKR and Shearson couldn't work out,&quot; said an RJR aide. But KKR's plan for RJR probably would lead to the sale of RJR's tobacco business. Mr. Johnson, who favors sale of the food business instead, also apparently bridled at KKR's management philosophy.    To Mr. Johnson, the RJR aide said, KKR's &quot;attitude seemed to be, 'You can operate things, but we make all the big decisions, on what is bought and sold.'&quot; Mr. Kravis asked that the RJR executive respond to his overtures to join his bid by midnight Tuesday.    Shearson, meanwhile, had offered to allow KKR to share in a buy-out with the RJR-Shearson group on a 50-50 basis, but KKR wasn't interested.    Shortly after midnight Tuesday, Shearson's Mr. Cohen and RJR's Mr. Johnson told KKR officials by phone that they were no longer interested in a takeover involving KKR. When KKR officials suggested meeting again at a later date, they were told any meetings would have to be immediate. Messrs. Kravis and Roberts and a KKR adviser arrived at RJR's offices about 1:15 a.m.    Things started out badly when KKR's Mr. Roberts, seeing Mr. Cohen puffing on a cigar, made his anti-smoking remark. &quot;He said something like, 'Do you guys make cigars?' and moved away from Peter Cohen,&quot; said a KKR aide, who added that Mr. Roberts &quot;thought it was kind of funny. Evidently they didn't. He just didn't want to sit next to a guy smoking a cigar in a closed space.&quot;    RJR's Mr. Johnson left the Shearson and KKR groups alone in the room, where for about two hours they hashed through possible compromise bids. However, participants say, KKR generally wanted more control over the bid than Shearson was willing to give. Sometime after 3 a.m. yesterday, the KKR team left, with no resolution of the differences.    About this time, Mr. Johnson sounded out RJR's top tobacco executives, including Edward A. Horrigan Jr., head of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. unit, about joining up with KKR. &quot;They were horrified,&quot; said one RJR aide. According to two RJR advisers, Mr. Horrigan and the tobacco executives said they couldn't work with KKR and would quit if forced to.    Later, RJR's Mr. Johnson told Mr. Kravis that he doubted a compromise could be reached. &quot;Ross just said, 'Look, basically, we have deep philosophical differences of how companies should be run, what makes good business sense, what is good for our communities, and I can't be part of supporting any concept like what you're suggesting,'&quot; an RJR aide said.    RJR executives also believed that KKR's $90-a-share bid would pile so much debt on RJR that KKR would be forced to close down RJR's Atlanta headquarters.    But a KKR spokesman, saying the RJR-Shearson group would sell more RJR assets in a takeover than KKR, denied any such plan: &quot;They think we want to destroy Atlanta? What do they think, KKR is named Sherman?&quot;    Meantime, in Delaware Chancery Court, two RJR shareholders filed suit seeking to enjoin the company from using a recently adopted &quot;poison pill&quot; takeover defense that they alleged could prevent the highest bidder from winning control of the company. An RJR spokesman declined to comment.    Separately, a special committee of RJR directors, formed to consider any bids for the company, met but took no actions. The five-member committee is expected to meet again next week.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, RJR closed at $84.75, down 50 cents.    ---    Estimated Breakup Value of RJR Nabisco's Businesses    Food:      Nabisco: $8 billion to $9.5 billion      Del Monte: $3 billion to $4 billion      Planters: $1.5 billion to $2 billion    Tobacco: $11.1 billion to $13.5 billion    TOTAL: $23.6 billion to $29 billion   Source: Analysts' estimates</TEXT></DOC>
