Mr. Davies also said the Review's lawyers will respond today to lawyers for Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew by denying that a Dec. 17 article in the magazine was defamatory. The prime minister's lawyers, Lee andamp; Lee, wrote the Review last Saturday, demanding a retraction, an apology and unspecified damages for the article. Today is the deadline for the Review's response.    &quot;The article wasn't defamatory, and we aren't apologizing,&quot; Mr. Davies said in a telephone interview.    Last week, the Singapore government, citing what it said was distorted reporting about the detention of 22 alleged Marxists, cut the Review's Singapore circulation to 500 copies from 9,000 copies, effective yesterday. The magazine has total sales of 74,500.    In a statement to the press that also will be carried in this week's issue of the Review, Mr. Davies said the magazine decided to halt its entire Singapore distribution because restricted circulation &quot;in effect places the distribution of the publication into the hands of the Singapore authorities, allowing them to pick and choose the institutions or readers which the Review reaches. This is unacceptable.&quot;    The Review is owned by Dow Jones andamp; Co., which publishes The Wall Street Journal, The Asian Wall Street Journal and The Wall Street Journal/Europe. </TEXT></DOC>
