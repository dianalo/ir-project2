Government spokesman Carlos Anleu said troops loyal to Cerezoarrested an undetermined number of air force personnel whoparticipated in the coup attempt, which lasted about two hours.   ``Everything is under control,'' Anleu said. He said the coupwas put down with no shots fired.   The attempt was staged by a tactical unit of the air force basedsouth of Guatemala City in a military section of the internationalairport, Anleu said, and was led by retired military officers. Hedid not identify them.   The coup attempt was stopped when soldiers loyal to thegovernment entered the city in tanks and helicopters, the spokesmansaid.   About 6:30 a.m. troops and soldiers, many wearing the bluehanderkerchiefs that are a sign of loyalists, surrounded the homeof the defense minister, Gen. Alejandro Gramajo. Military planesand helicopters flew overhead and tanks were parked strategicallynearby.   In May 1988, a military coup attempt failed when Gramajo refusedto join it and backed the civilian government.   By 8:30 a.m., most of the troops had returned to their barracksand the aircraft returned to their bases. Morning rush-houractivity had returned to normal in the capital. Radio stationsplayed military music during the attempt, then returned to normalprogramming.   In Washington, a State Department official said reports from theU.S. Embassy and from Guatemalans also indicated the coup attemptwas unsuccessful. The official said the coup attempt may have beenaimed not at Cerezo, whose whereabouts were unknown, but at Granajoor other cabinet ministers.   Cerezo took office in January 1986, heading the first electedcivilian administration in 16 years. He had been under attack fromthe right wing for opening talks with the leftist insurgency, theRevolutionary Union, which has been conducting a guerrilla war for30 years.   During the attempted coup by army officers on May 11, 1988, twocolumns of troops marched on the capital to seize power. But theirattempt was quashed without a shot being fired. Six officers werearrested.   On April 16, Cerezo blamed rightist paramilitary groups for agrowing wave of violence and said they threatened the nation'sdemocracy. ``Democracy is being put in danger by the recklessnessof some groups and people who constantly violate the law,'' he saidin a nationally broadcast address.   The president blamed the right-wing groups for the death of IrmaEsquivel de Lara, 37, a criminal court judge who was gunned down ona street in the capital earlier in April.   ``There exist some groups traditionally of the extreme rightthat aren't happy with democracy. They don't like it that we aresatisfied with a democratic government,'' Cerezo said at the time.   Cerezo, 46, a Christian Democrat, is due to leave office in 1991.   The Central American nation of 8.5 million people, about thesize of Tennessee, is bounded on the north and west by Mexico, thesouth by the Pacific Ocean and the east by El Salvador, Hondurasand Belize.   Guatemala never has sustained a modern democratic govenment. Itis widely agreed that civilian authority exists because of militaryconsent and supervision.   Guatemala was widely shunned by the international communitywhile the country was under the military rulers of the early 1980s.The armed forces and death squads linked to the military wereblamed for killing tens of thousands of people. The army denied thecharges.   Thousands of Indians were killed or driven into the hills. Morethan half the population is made up of Indians who speak two dozenMayan dialects.   Former President Carter cut off U.S. aid to the country, butnon-military aid was restored under the Reagan administration.</TEXT></DOC>
