(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two former executives of Norden Systemstoday admitted they conspired to obtain confidential DefenseDepartment bid information on a lucrative Marine Corps contract.   James E. Rapinac, a former senior vice president, and C.J.Richardson, a former marketing official, pleaded guilty toconspiracy to defraud the government and convert governmentproperty.   The two acknowledged that they conspired in 1987 to pay defenseconsultant Thomas Muldoon $49,500 to obtain the information aboutthe contract for a radar command and control system valued at up to$150 million.   Muldoon, who was convicted Thursday of participating in aseparate bribery scheme, obtained the information from fellowdefense consultant Mark Saunders, according to court papers filedby prosecutors.   Saunders, who has not been charged in the continuinginvestigation of Pentagon procurement fraud, is alleged to haveobtained the bid information from former Navy procurement officialGeorge Stone. Stone has not yet been charged in the investigation,nicknamed Operation Ill Wind.   The pleas by Rapinac and Richardson were accepted by U.S.District Judge Claude M. Hilton, who scheduled sentencing for March9. Both defendants could receive up to five years' imprisonment andbe fined as much as $250,000.   In a statement, Rapinac said, ``While I offer no excuses for myactions, I do believe the defense acquisition process is conduciveto abuses.''   Earlier in the day, Hilton sentenced two former executives ofanother defense firm, Whittaker Corp., on their guilty pleas tobribery charges in an unrelated scheme.   Scott M. Lamberth, 59, a former vice president of a Whittakersubsidiary, was ordered to serve 10 months in prison and fined$10,000 for his role in a scheme to funnel more than $80,000 to aPentagon procurement official.   Also sentenced was John Franklin Van Tassel, a former Whittakeremployee, who received a three-month term in a halfway house forhis role in the scheme. Van Tassel, who headed the California-baseddefense firm's Fayetteville, Ark., operation, was also fined $3,000.   Both men had pleaded guilty Sept. 26 to bribery charges inconnection with a scheme to funnel money to former Marine Corpscontracting official Jack A. Sherman.   The bribes were funneled through Muldoon, who was convictedThursday of eight charges, including bribery and conspiracy. BothLamberth and Van Tassel testified as prosecution witnesses againstMuldoon.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica acknowledged that bothmen had cooperated with the government's investigation of Pentagonprocurement fraud, nicknamed ``Operation Ill Wind.''   Aronica said Van Tassel played a minor role in the scheme.Before he was sentenced, Lamberth urged Hilton to show leniency forVan Tassel, who he said ``only acted as a good trouper who carriedout my orders.''   Lamberth and Van Tassel were executives of LeeTelecommunications, which was taken over by Whittaker in 1986.Lamberth was a vice president and Van Tassel was head ofWhittaker's Arkansas operation.   Van Tassel now lives in Colorado Springs, Colo., and Lamberthlives near Durango, Colo.   Another former Whittaker executive, Leonard Ingram, wasacquitted of all bribery and conspiracy charges against him by thesame jury that convicted Muldoon.   The jury's verdict against Muldoon followed more than two daysof testimony, including tape recordings of wiretapped conversationsinvolving Muldoon, company officials and other defense consultants.   Ingram testified he made repeated protests to Lamberth about thebribery scheme but was told to mind his own business.   Lamberth testified Ingram did object but later stopped. Thetestimony was offered to try to convince jurors that Ingrameventually acquiesced.   ``Ill Wind blew itself out,'' Ingram's lawyer, Marcus Topel,said after the verdict. ``In their zeal to broaden thisinvestigation, (prosecutors) put too much reliance on thecredibility of their informants.''   Hilton scheduled Muldoon's sentencing for Feb. 16. He faces apossible 70-year prison term and a maximum fine of $1.04 million.   During the trial, Sherman testified he negotiated to receivemore than $80,000 worth of bribes in return for helping LeeTelecommunications get Marine Corps electronic contracts.   Sherman said Muldoon and two other defense consultants, who alsotestified as government witnesses, served as conduits for thepayments. Muldoon and he split the bribe money, with Sherman takinga third.   Sherman, who is serving an 18-month prison term after pleadingguilty to a separate scheme, recalled receiving $25,000 fromMuldoon.   Ingram, 51, of Huntsville, Ala., was a stockholder and vicepresident of Lee Telecommunications. He became a vice president ofWhittaker Command and Control Systems after the 1986 takeover.   The Whittaker subsidiary pleaded guilty to bribery andconspiracy and paid $3.5 million in penalties.   More than 25 individuals and four corporations have beenconvicted in the continuing investigation.   In the only other trial, a former Teledyne Electronics executivewas acquitted last spring during a trial at which two of hiscolleagues were convicted for their roles in the influence-peddlingscandal.</TEXT></DOC>
