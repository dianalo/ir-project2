Troops were still scouring the smoldering rubble of the ravagedLa Tablada base Tuesday night as Alfonsin told the nation the attackwas ``a new challenge that I believe is the most serious anddecisive of my administration.''   The 3rd Infantry Regiment base was seized Monday by heavily armedcivilians and retaken a day later by army and police forces who hadpummeled commando positions with howitzers, mortars, grenades andmachine-gun fire.   In his nationally broadcast speech, the president recalled hisimpressions of the base and the charred and mangled corpses heencountered there: ``It was a nightmare. Death, once again death.The brutality, the barbarity.''   He said seven soldiers, one policeman and 28 commandos werekilled and that all but four of the 67 wounded were soldiers andpolicemen.   Authorities said troops captured 14 of the commandos, whoapparently intended to steal weapons from the base and quickly flee.   Alfonsin described the attackers as ``irregular elements ofultra-leftist affiliation,'' citing a written proclamation found atthe base as ``evidence of their hallucination.''   A copy of the proclamation given to reporters said the base wasseized to pre-empt a purportedly imminent coup by right-wing armyofficers.   ``We are fed up with the arrogance of the military,'' it said.   Alfonsin was elected in 1983 to end a nearly eight-year militarydictatorship during which 8,900 suspected leftist subversives werearrested and vanished without a trace, presumably murdered bysecurity forces.   Given such incidents as the La Tablada raid, a Dec. 4 militaryuprising led by now-cashiered Col. Mohamed Seineldin, and thesubsequent bombing of the Communist Party's headquarters,Argentine's fear that political extremism is returning to thecountry.   The English-language newspaper Buenos Aires Herald commented inan editorial Tuesday:   ``If the (La Tablada) attack did come from the extreme left, thismeans that democracy is now under a two-pronged assault from rightand left for the first time in more than a decade....   ``Now the army has the terrorist threat that has been missing solong and the government must worry about the civilian left, not justthe military right.''   Presidential elections are set for May 14. By law, Alfonsincannot run for re-election, and favored to win is the oppositionparty candidate, Carlos Menem. Inflation is averaging more than 300percent a year, real wages are declining and economic and socialunrest is high.   Alfonsin on Tuesday set up a national security council. He didnot say who would sit on the body, but it was generally believedthat top military officials would be among its members.   The president praised the soldiers' bravery in retaking the base,and said: ``I want to tell them that this is also my fight ... and Iwill fight it to the end.'' Looking on as he spoke were his militarychiefs of staff.   The right-wing armed forces in this country that has seen sixmilitary coups since 1930 have been a constant headache for Alfonsin.   In the past 21 months, he has had to cope with three uprisings byelements in the army angered by the prosecution of officers forhuman rights abuses.   Alfonsin has insisted that subversion be combatted within legalbounds, unlike the military's ``dirty war'' of the 1970s when thethousands of suspected leftists disappeared.   ``This is our chance to show the world and ourselves that we havelearned from the past,'' he declared Tuesday night.   The president said leftist extremism would be fought ``onlywithin the law, but with all the force of the law.''   ``If anyone believes that democracy is a weak system, they noware going to learn how wrong they are,'' he said. ``This is the lastgreat test of my government and we are not going to lose.''</TEXT></DOC>
