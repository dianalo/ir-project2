The five-member delegations of both sides agreed to meet againFeb. 10 at this truce village inside the Demilitarized Zoneseprating the two nations.   The three-hour meeting plunged into stalemate a few minutes afterit opened when North Korea issued a new demand for an end to annualU.S.-South Korea ``Team Spirit'' exercises it says threaten itssecurity.   The chief North Korean delegate, Chon Kum Chul, said this was aprecondition for the parliamentary talks and other proposals forinter-Korea contacts.   ``Team Sprit war exercises have created a state of quasi-war andaffected South-North talks in progress. The exercises have been thebiggest obstacle blocking the progress of dialogue,'' Chon said.   His South Korean counterpart, Chai Mun-shick, accused North Koreaof laying a new obstacle before the talks and insisted the issue beaddressed at other government-level talks expected early next year.North Korea rejected the idea.   South Korea and the United States hold annual spring militaryexercises to practice their joint command system in the event of aNorth Korean invasion. About 200,000 troops of both sides took partin last year's exercises from February to April.   South Korea had hoped before Thursday's meeting, the seventhsince August, that agreement was near on setting terms forfull-scale talks between each side's legislatures after makingprogress at a Nov. 17 meeting.   Chai expressed ``surprise and suspicion'' at North Korea's newdemand and asked that it be dropped, saying the exercises are annualand defensive.   ``North Korea's demand is very disappointing. I suspect thattheir resolve to make the talks a success has weakened,'' Chai saidafter the meeting.   Chon declined to withdraw the demand and suggested the militaryexercises could be an obstacle to the parliamentary talks andproposals for separate government and sports talks.   Rep. Park Kwan-yong, an opposition member on the South Koreandelegation, said North Korea used the same tactics three years ago.   Park, a member of South Korean negotiating team in talks withNorth Korea in 1985, said lawmakers of both sides were close toagreement and scheduled to meet in mid-February in 1986. North Koreaunilaterally suspended all dialogue to protest the ``Team Spirit''exercises.   The meeting was held the day after Seoul sent a message to NorthKorea agreeing to separate political and military talks on armsreductions and other tension-easing measures.   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon wrote his North Koreancounterpart, Yon Hyung Muk, that they head delegations toalternating talks in Seoul and Pyongyang to discussnon-interference, cooperation in select areas and building ``mutualtrust in military matters.''   South Korea has yet to respond to three more North Koreanproposals for political, military and sports talks. One proposalseeks the withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops stationed here undera mutual defense treaty.   Talks have been held on and off since the early 1970s with littleprogress. Both sides have tended to stress their respectiveinitiatives and play down the other's proposals.   The two Koreas have hundreds of thousands of troops facing eachother along the 150-mile border. The border is sealed and there areno communications except for a hot line.   U.S. and Soviet forces divided the Korean peninsula when theyended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II in 1945.North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950 to start the Korean War.</TEXT></DOC>
