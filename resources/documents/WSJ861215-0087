But it wants Congress, in return, to vote additional military spending in the current year.    Administration officials disclosed that the Pentagon and the White House budget office agreed to propose increasing defense spending during fiscal 1988 by 3%, after inflation, above the level appropriated in this fiscal year. Fiscal 1988 begins Oct. 1.    Pentagon officials said they preferred a higher figure, but White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan and Budget Director James Miller argued that the administration would end up getting more from lawmakers by submitting a more politically realistic request. They noted that for the current fiscal year, the administration sought $320 billion for the military but got only $289.6 billion.    The Defense Department acquiesced to that argument without carrying its case to the president. But the Pentagon did obtain White House approval to seek a supplemental appropriation for fiscal 1987, which ends Sept. 30. Pentagon officials said they were still thrashing out details of a supplemental request.    Officials said that the administration will seek $312 billion in spending authority for the fiscal 1988 military budget. That is $4 billion more than the $308 billion figure previously estimated as reflecting a 3% inflation-adjusted increase.    Officials, sensitive to charges leveled in the past, said the higher figure doesn't result from accounting chicanery. They said the additional amount represents increased spending authority that all agencies -- including the Pentagon -- must request because of changes in the federal retirement system. The new spending authority won't result in actual outlays for years.    President Reagan is scheduled to submit his fiscal 1988 budget to Congress on Jan. 5. Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), the next chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has said the Pentagon will be lucky to get an increase much above the rate of inflation. </TEXT></DOC>
