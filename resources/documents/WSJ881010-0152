Nelson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP </CO><IN> MON </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In Margaret Thatcher's recent pronouncements about the future of the European Community, many Europeans hear echoes of Charles de Gaulle.    The late French president 25 years ago ruled out a United States of Europe, defended the sovereignty of national governments and railed against EC bureaucrats in Brussels. But, like the France of de Gaulle then, the Britain of Prime Minister Thatcher today is more tied to the future of the EC than its leader's separatist rhetoric suggests. In reality, Mrs. Thatcher has presided over extensive integration of Britain with the Continent. Her programs encourage British businesses to develop EC markets. She supports the EC in international trade talks, even when that seems counter to Britain's best interests. She battles Tory critics who say she is giving away too much to the EC and opposition critics who say she isn't doing enough.    &quot;The point now is that Britain belongs,&quot; says Philippe Moreau Defarges, a professor at the French Institute of Political Science in Paris. &quot;And this belonging is irreversible.&quot;    Moreover, by striking an overtly cantankerous pose, Mrs. Thatcher has made herself surprisingly influential in setting the EC's agenda. Last year, for example, she singlehandedly deadlocked two summit meetings because fellow ministers wouldn't agree to cut farm subsidies. Not until she got some of her demands would she let an overall budget be approved.    Indeed, Mrs. Thatcher seems to be applying one of Mr. de Gaulle's principles of power. &quot;Authority,&quot; he wrote in 1932, &quot;requires prestige, and prestige requires remoteness.&quot;    Yet her approach entails increasing risk. Too much remoteness could easily become true isolation, diplomats and political analysts say, and Britain could find itself the odd man out at a crucial time. In the EC's current drive to remove internal trade barriers by the end of 1992, for example, many economists say Britain has more to gain than to lose. Businessmen and others see the 1992 agenda as Europe's best hope for competing economically with the U.S. and Japan.    While backing its commercial aspects, Mrs. Thatcher opposes parts of the program that infringe on British economic sovereignty, particularly more-unified tax policies and monetary systems. If she is perceived as blocking the 1992 program, the result could be to send the EC into another period of bickering and stagnation, with British influence destroyed.    Many Europeans already see Mrs. Thatcher's tactics as obstructionist. For instance, they object to her insistence that costly, time-consuming customs procedures be retained to fight terrorism and drugs. Law enforcement officials say other methods of attacking the problem could be just as effective.    Some fear this approach could extend to security issues, not normally an EC concern. At the moment, the United Kingdom acts as a stabilizing third force between France and West Germany. Smaller EC states fear that without a fully involved Britain, France and West Germany would dominate European defense efforts.    Most of Mrs. Thatcher's positions say more about British domestic politics than about the EC. Trying to walk a tightrope between Britain's anti-European tradition and the economic power that London aspires to be creates the contradictions.    Yet Mrs. Thatcher has integrated Britain's economy into the EC more tightly than many Britons realize. EC countries buy more than half of Britain's exports. British farmers flourish under the EC's Common Agriculture Policy, and its food companies have grown to global giants, in part because of EC markets. In all, one in six British workers owes his job to Britain's trade relationship with the EC.    Despite Mrs. Thatcher's occasional battles with other EC members, many EC officials concede she often suports actions that strengthen the community. They cite her insistence on budgetary restraint, bureacratic minimalism and legal precision in EC documents and policies. &quot;She can be difficult, a real pain,&quot; says a European diplomat in Brussels. &quot;But Europe is better off with her than without her.&quot;    The 1992 agenda also has pushed British civil servants into an unprecedented relationship with the EC and its goals, challenging the dominant French role created by Britain's refusal to join in the 1950s. But close ties with the EC don't always win political support at home. That's why Mrs. Thatcher promises repeatedly she will never let Brussels push around her government or infringe on British sovereignty. Many Britons fear entanglements with countries &quot;over there,&quot; where they fought two world wars.    In August, for example, the Star, a down-market, right-wing daily with more than a million readers, published a &quot;1992 Euro-Shocker&quot; special section. Among its many, largely specious revelations: &quot;Mrs. Thatcher doesn't run the country anymore. Nor does the government.&quot; After 1992, &quot;our troops may be told to 'Achtung!'&quot; under a German commander. And the Seoul Olympics may be the last time Britain fields its own team; in the future it may have to join a unified EC sports delegation.    Beyond such scare tactics, even serious British politicians worry over the direction Mrs. Thatcher is pushing the country. Her anti-European Tory critics sometimes claim she is naively charging into a European superstate that will threaten Atlantic relations and hurt Britain's global outlook. They see 1992 as requiring the surrender of power. For example, they say, removing border controls would lead to a common currency, then a central bank, and finally to a stronger European parliament able to override national parliaments.    &quot;The European federalists are achieving their goal by sleight of hand,&quot; charges Sir Richard Body, a Conservative member of Parliament. &quot;They are taking this country along a series of steps, each of which is irreversible and each of which is toward a federal union.&quot;    At the other end of the spectrum, Labor Party policy makers criticize Mrs. Thatcher's refusal to support EC social programs. This anger galvanized Labor into surmounting its historic opposition to the EC. Now the left uses the EC as a club against the prime minister, especially in pushing for the richer social benefits found in France and Germany.    The EC already plays an important role in British social policies. Two advances for women's rights in Britain, an equal-pay bill and an equal-treatment bill, resulted from rulings by the European Court of Justice, not from actions by the country's first female prime minister. </TEXT></DOC>
