Spoor, was named chairman of the executive committee, replacing John M. Stafford, the company's chairman, chief executive officer and president. The move sparked speculation about a possible management shake-up or restructuring at the food giant.    Pillsbury's executive committee, consisting of five directors, meets several times a year on policy matters that are later discussed by the full board.    &quot;It's a blow to Stafford. It's a demotion for him,&quot; said Craig Carver, a food industry analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc.    Messrs. Stafford and Spoor weren't available for comment yesterday.    The 50-year-old Mr. Stafford, who was groomed by Mr. Spoor, took over when the 64-year-old Mr. Spoor retired in September 1985. But Pillsbury's earnings have since slumped. In the fiscal year ended May 31, net income fell 13% to $182 million, or $2.10 a share -- the first profit drop in 16 years. Sales rose 5% to $6.13 billion.    Criticism has been growing among securities analysts that Mr. Stafford, whose experience is concentrated in packaged-food lines, has done a poor job of managing Pillsbury's restaurant operations. In fiscal 1987, the restaurant's pretax earnings plunged 28% to $219 million.    Some former Pillsbury executives yesterday indicated that the company's board is unhappy with the restaurant group. &quot;Burger King has been soft and Steak and Ale has been weak,&quot; one former executive said. He added, &quot;You don't bring back the ex-chairman unless there's disappointment on the board.&quot;    A Pillsbury spokesman said that Mr. Stafford will continue to report directly to the board, and that he asked Mr. Spoor to head the executive committee. &quot;This doesn't signal a management shake-up,&quot; the spokesman insisted.    But Mr. Spoor seems likely to play an active management role. Although he will maintain the outside office he has had since retiring, he will be given an office near Mr. Stafford's on the 40th floor at the company's downtown Minneapolis headquarters. &quot;If you're around the office day to day, you're going to be involved,&quot; said John McMillin, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. &quot;Spoor has a little of the Henry Ford complex; he just can't give it up,&quot; he added.    One Pillsbury director, who asked not to be identified, said Mr. Spoor's appointment came because Mr. Stafford is stretched too thin. He noted that Mr. Spoor had a vice chairman, Winston Wallin, to share top executive duties. But Mr. Wallin left Pillsbury in 1985 for another company. The director added that while Mr. Spoor supports Mr. Stafford, the younger man can use some help. &quot;Life doesn't get any simpler,&quot; he said.    Although Pillsbury didn't announce the management change, Wall Street reacted favorably as rumors spread yesterday that Mr. Spoor would play a more-active role.    In trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, the company's stock rose $1.75, closing at $45.375.    Some analysts have wanted Mr. Stafford to be more decisive about the restaurant operations. Specifically, they want him to sell the slumping Steak and Ale chain and reduce the number of new chains the company is experimenting with. &quot;They've got to decide what's most promising and put their money behind that,&quot; said Dain Bosworth's Mr. Carver.    Mr. Spoor has a reputation for being gruffly decisive. He led Pillsbury through its period of greatest growth in the 1970s and early 1980s, when sales quadrupled to more than $5 billion a year. Burger King became a strong No. 2 in the fast-food industry, and the company made such large acquisitions as Green Giant and Totino's Pizza.    In contrast to Mr. Stafford, who is viewed as a delegating diplomat, Mr. Spoor's legacy is one of dominating central authority. He may tighten the reins on the company's far-flung restaurant operations, based in Dallas and Miami, analysts said.    Mr. Stafford joined Pillsbury in 1979 as part of the Green Giant acquisition. He was named executive vice president in 1979 and president of its consumer-foods business two years later. He became a director in 1983.    Pillsbury's 14-member board is still dominated by directors named during the Spoor era. &quot;It's still Spoor's board,&quot; said Prudential-Bache's Mr. McMillin. </TEXT></DOC>
