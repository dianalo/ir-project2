(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Space shuttle Discovery blasted offon a secret military mission Wednesday night, staging a brilliantThanksgiving-eve fireworks show as it rode twin 700-foot geysers offire into orbit.   ``We are delighted with the results,'' said Forrest McCartney,director of the Kennedy Space Center. ``It's something thatAmericans can be proud and thankful for on Thanksgiving.''   As the shuttle completed its second circuit around Earth,Mission Control gave a two-sentence status report:   ``The crew of Discovery has been given a go for orbitoperations; the orbiter and crew are doing well,'' said spokeswomanBillie Deason. It meant the astronauts had been given permission tolaunch their secret cargo, reportedly a spy satellite to bereleased in the 10th hour of flight.   The shuttle lifted almost straight up and headed out over theAtlantic Ocean, its booster rocket fire carving two trails in thesky. The light could be seen in Miami, 200 miles to the south.   ``It was 100 times brighter than a star,'' said Glenna Milberg,a television reporter in Miami.   Nothing was heard over the public communications channel fromCol. Frederick D. Gregory, the shuttle commander. NASA providedlaunch commentary until Discovery reached orbit nine minutes afterlaunch and then the system went silent.   ``Liftoff of space shuttle Discovery for its Thanksgiving Dayflight,'' said Launch Control's George Diller. Indeed, theastronauts were carrying five meals of turkey and gravy in theirfood locker.   Night turned into day over the central Florida coast asDiscovery flashed to life with a light twice as brilliant as thesun. The sky was cloudless, the sight dazzling.   Liftoff occurred at 7:23 p.m. after a blacked-out countdown madepublic just minutes before launch.   At two minutes after liftoff, the spent booster rockets felloff; ships were waiting below to recover them.   The shuttle still was visible at the launch center as a verybright star in the sky even when it was more than 650 miles awayand traveling about 6,800 mph.   As the 100-ton spacecraft rocketed away, the ground a the spacecenter shook and windows rattled. Clouds of steam billowed out ofthe flame trenches below the shuttle as 100,000 gallons of water aminute poured out to douse the fire.   Discovery's mission is to put a spy satellite into orbit, butthe Air Force gave no details. NASA was under instructions to saynothing further about the mission, except to give advance landingnotice.   The exact schedule, like everything else about this 32nd shuttlemission, was secret.   This was the third night launch in the shuttle program, and onlythe fourth in 28 years of manned space flight. Discovery'stimetable was dictated by the cargo and its mission.   Sources said the 2{-ton, $300 million satellite cradled inDiscovery's cargo bay is capable of listening in on military anddiplomatic communications _ voice and telemetry _ broadcast fromSoviet military installations. The satellite's duty post is to be22,300 miles over the equator, with line-of-sight to the SovietUnion, China, the Middle East, Africa and all of Europe.   A similar satellite was released on a shuttle flight in 1985.   On the last launch after dark, the fiery trail of the shuttle'stwo solid rocket boosters could be seen along a 700-mile strip fromCharleston, S.C., to Key West, Fla., and in the Bahamas.   Police in nearby Titusville prepared for about 50,000 people togather at prime viewing sites _ only a fraction of the crowds thatlined the roads for the early launches, but more than for otherliftoffs in recent months.   The flight was the fifth turned over entirely to the DefenseDepartment.   It is also only the third launch after dark, a timetabledictated by the cargo and its mission.   In late morning, National Aeronautics and Space Administrationcrews turned valves to send 528,000 gallons of supercold liquidhydrogen and liquid oxygen surging into Discovery's propellanttank, a three-hour procedure during which the launch pad area iscleared of people.   When that was completed, about 1 p.m., the countdown entered atwo-hour planned hold and an inspection team went to the pad tocheck for ice buildup on the fuel tank. Chunks of ice breaking awayduring launch could damage the orbiter's fragile surface.   The astronaut crew of four men and one woman slept past noon toadjust to the mission schedule. Their flight is expected to lastfour days, but NASA won't announce the landing at Edwards Air ForceBase in California until 24 hours before it's due to happen.   Sources said the 2{-ton, $300 million satellite cradled inDiscovery's cargo bay is capable of listening in on military anddiplomatic communications _ voice and telemetry _ broadcast fromSoviet military installations. The satellite's duty post is to be22,300 miles over the equator, with line-of-sight to the SovietUnion, China, the Middle East, Africa and all of Europe.   A similar satellite was released on a shuttle flight in 1985.   Gregory, an Air Force Academy graduate, will be the first blackastronaut to command a shuttle mission. He was pilot of the shuttleChallenger on a flight in 1985.   Discovery's pilot is Air Force Col. John E. Blaha, making hissecond flight this year. He is a replacement for astronaut S. DavidGriggs, who was killed last June while practicing stunt flying foran air show.   The others are mission specialists F. Story Musgrave, Navy Capt.Manley ``Sonny'' Carter Jr. and Kathryn C. Thornton.   Military officials say the secrecy is necessary to make it moredifficult for Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship offCape Canaveral to track the shuttle.   Critics argue that Soviet intelligence agents undoubtedlyalready know a great deal about the mission and that once Discoveryis in orbit, they will be able to track it precisely and know whatis doing.   The menu for the mission includes ``thermostabilized'' turkeyand gravy, which means the food has enough preservatives to becarried without refrigeration.</TEXT></DOC>
