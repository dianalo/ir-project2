In its revised economic management program issued Wednesday, theagency forecast that South Korea's gross national product wouldswell to the equivalent of $145 billion, up 8 percent from lastyear.   That would boost the country's per capita GNP for this year to$3,450, up $637 from last year, the planning board said.   Under the original projections, 1988 GNP was expected to reach$124 billion for a per capita GNP of $2,922.   The GNP is the total output of goods and services a countryproduces in a year.   Government officials said stronger-than-expected exports so farthis year have prompted them to revise the projections upward.   South Korea's merchandise exports during January and Februaryreached $8.01 billion, up 39.9 percent from the same period lastyear.   At that pace, total 1988 exports would rise to $55 billion andimports to $50 billion, creating a trade surplus of $5 billion,according to the revised figures.   The projected trade surplus, combined with an expected surplusof $2 billion in invisible trade items such as tourism income,would help South Korea register a current-account surplus of $7billion this year.   Helped by strong exports, South Korea's current-account surplusmore than doubled to $9.78 billion last year from the 1986 level.   The current account measures trade in goods and services pluscertain unilateral transfers.   The projected current-account surplus would help South Koreatrim its external debts to $31 billion from $35.6 billion at theend of last year, the agency said.   An additional 354,000 new jobs would be created this year butthe unemployment rate would rise to 3.7 percent from 3.1 percentlast year, it said.</TEXT></DOC>
