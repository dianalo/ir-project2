ExpectsTo Post Slight RiseIn Earnings for 1986</HL><DD> 12/09/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DBDDOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO) </IN><DATELINE> CANTON, Ohio  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Diebold Inc. expects to report 1986 earnings that are slightly better than last year's $30.4 million, or $2.32 a share, as it continues to feel the effects of the down cycle in sales of automatic teller machines, its main product.    Robert W. Mahoney, chief executive officer, declined to give a specific earnings forecast, but said analysts' projections of per-share earnings this year of $2.75 &quot;are probably on the high end of the range.&quot; For the first nine months of 1986, Diebold earned $24.9 million, or $1.90 a share, on sales of $303.7 million.    Mr. Mahoney said analysts' estimates of 1987 per-share earnings of about $3.35 are &quot;in the ballpark,&quot; although he declined to estimate earnings for next year.    Diebold, which also makes safes, security systems and other electronic products, has seen many banks delay major purchases of new automated equipment while they evaluate how far they should go with automation, Mr. Mahoney said in an interview.    Diebold next year plans to introduce new products that are currently in pilot marketing stages, such as its so-called &quot;everywhere teller machine,&quot; or ETM, which is smaller than the standard automatic teller machine, and an interactive video system, which communicates with consumers by providing information on events and tickets.    Seeking to expand its product line further, Diebold last October signed a $36 million contract with closely held Group 1 Entertainment, which has agreed to buy 2,000 &quot;video venders&quot; machines, slated for delivery by August 1987. The machines will dispense videocassettes to credit-card customers. </TEXT></DOC>
