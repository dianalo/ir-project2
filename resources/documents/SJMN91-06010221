If I hada eucalyptus tree and found somebody up it, I'd probably be up it&quot; to get theperson down, Gibbs said.;    Seifert, who has closed practices to the media,reported that there were no spies in the trees surrounding the 49ers' facilityWednesday, but that a suspicious blimp passed over the field.; ETC.: TheNiners' Charles Haley, who led the NFC in sacks with 16, was named the NFCdefensive player of the year by United Press International. . . . Seifert saidsafety Chet Brooks remained off the practice squad. Seifert conceded that thefact that Brooks has not practiced for two days this week &quot;probably&quot; hurts hischances of being the one injured-reserve player the 49ers are entitled toactivate for the game.
