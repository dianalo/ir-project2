The soldiers opened fire on the Palestinians, who had allegedlykilled a suspected Israeli collaborator in the past, authoritiessaid.   Seven soldiers were wounded, including a high-ranking Israeliofficer in critical condition after he was wounded in the head,said an army spokeswoman who was not identified under militaryregulations. The soldier was killed by a grenade thrown by thePalestinians, officials said.   The clash brought to 487 the number of Palestinians killed inthe uprising. It also raised to 22 the number of Israelis who havedied in the violence, including eight soldiers.   Also today, troops arrested about 100 Palestinian activists inthe Gaza Strip, including Sheih Ahmed Yassin, 52, the spiritualleader of the Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas, Arab reportssaid. Hamas, Arabic for zeal, is a principal group coordinating theuprising.   In the West Bank village of Surif, the army blew up two homes ofPalestinians allegedly involved in attacks on soldiers, the armysaid. Western nations have condemned house demolitions because theyare usually carried out before a suspect has been charged or tried.   The incident occurred in Beit Aula, a village of 1,500 residentsabout 15 miles southwest of Jerusalem. Troops blocked access toBeit Aula, stopping journalists at the nearby village of Halhoul.   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the army commander of the West Bank,denied the gun battle marked a new phase in the uprising.   ``I don't think this is a turning point,'' he said.   Mitzna said the Palestinians were affiliated with the Fatahfaction headed by Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine LiberationOrganization.   Mitzna said the incident began when an alleged Palestiniancollaborator from the West Bank village of Nuba near Beit Aulacalled the army for help, saying he was being attacked by fellowvillagers.   Troops responding to the call passed through Beit Aula, and``unexpectedly met a suspect car,'' Mitzna told reporters.   ``There was a chase, and they (soldiers) opened fire. The resultwas three of the group (Palestinians) were killed, and one of oursoldiers was killed, and another one was wounded very seriously,''Mitzna said.   The Israeli soldier driving the lead jeep was killed by a handgrenade, an army spokesman said. The battalion commander, alieutenant colonel, was critically wounded in the grenade blast.   ``I was in a vehicle behind the lead jeep. I opened fire ... andshot the terrorist in the front seat,'' a soldier involved in thefirefight, identified only as Capt. Rafi, told Israel radio. ``Ithen saw another terrorist in the back seat holding an M-16 riflewho was also firing. I reloaded and continued firing.''   Mitzna said the three Palestinian victims were wanted byauthorities. ``They acted mainly against villagers who helpedIsraeli authorities, and those who opposed the rule of theintefadeh (Arabic for uprising),'' he said.   An army spokesman said the Palestinians had killed one suspectedcollaborator.   An army spokeswoman said the three Palestinians had anAmerican-made M-16 assault rifle, an Israeli Uzi submachine gun anda pistol.   Today's Israeli victim was the fourth soldier shot to deathduring the uprising, but he was the first to die in a full-scalegun battle. The other four soldier's deaths came from stonings andstabbings.   Underground leaders of the uprising have urged Palestinians notto use guns, saying such an escalation would only bring strongretribution by Israel.   Beit Aula has a long history of disputes between residents andalleged collaborators.</TEXT></DOC>
