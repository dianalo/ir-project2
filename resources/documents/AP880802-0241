After a decade off the air, ABC is bringing back Peter Falk asthe beloved, rumpled detective in a series of movies. Like otherfall shows, its debut has been delayed by the writers' strike.   Falk told a meeting of television critics that, far from balkingat a return to the small screen as Columbo, ``I never wanted it togo off in the first place.   ``It was always a problem to find out some way whereby from mypoint of view, we could do a limited number of `Columbos' and stilldo something else, so I wouldn't spend my whole life doing this.There were movies I wanted to do.''   Since the show left the air in 1977, Falk has had a successfulmovie career. But he still is recognized worldwide as thecharacter, even when he was shooting a movie, ``Vibes,'' in SouthAmerica recently.   ``We're in the Andes Mountains, 18,000 feet above sea level,''he said. ``And there are these little villages, Indians,descendants of the Aztecs, very poor little hovels. I come there,and they all run out and yell, `Columbo!'   ``God did not design anybody to be recognized by 2 billionpeople. It's something I can't get used to. Do you know what thatis, that they know who you are? You don't know who they are. ...It's a strange thing, this television.''   Executive producer William Link, who created ``Columbo'' withhis late partner Richard Levinson, expects ``Columbo'' to be a hitonce again.   For one thing, he says, ``Columbo'' is still wildly popular inforeign reruns. For another, mysteries are more popular than ever.   Link is also the producer of the highly successful andlong-running CBS series ``Murder, She Wrote.''   The reason ``Columbo'' remains so popular, said Link, ``is thatthe format and that character met Falk, and it was a marriage madein TV heaven.   ``Peter brought to it I think a humanity that wasn't there onpaper. He brought an everyman quality to it.''   ``Columbo'' will be part of a rotation series of mystery movies,as it was in the '70s. The other two movies will be ``GideonOliver,'' starring Louis Gossett Jr., and an as yet-untitled moviestarring Burt Reynolds.   Link said ``Columbo'' will not likely get on the air beforeJanuary because of the writers' strike, and because the producersrefuse to rush the series.   There will be no tinkering with the successful format of``Columbo,'' he said. Each episode pits the seemingly dull-witteddetective against a brilliant killer who has gotten away with aperfect crime until Columbo hesitates, turns and issues histradmark line, ``There's just one thing that bothers me ...''   ``It's a rigid format. We're not going to change it,'' saidLink. ``There'll be no car chases, he doesn't carry a gun, stillsmokes cigars, still has that raincoat that probably stands up byitself.''   The raincoat may even be the same one Columbo wore during sevenyears on the air in the '70s, though Falk worries that the agingand fragile garment is not as up for a new round of crime-solvingas he is.   The raincoat became almost as big a star as Falk. One of the TVcritics was even convinced it had been enshrined in theSmithsonian. Falk said no, the coat he bought on 57th Street inManhattan in 1967 is only enshrined in his closet.   ``I have a great deal of affection for it, and I take very goodcare of it. I've been known to say I put out a saucer of milk forit every night.''   He and Link get a little fuzzy on who is responsible for theraincoat.   Falk insists the raincoat was called for in the first``Columbo'' script, based on the stage play ``Prescription:Murder.''   ``I would like to get that script and see, because I think itsaid in the script that he wore a raincoat,'' Falk told Link.   ``In the stage play, I remember it was a topcoat,'' recalledLink. ``The screenplay `Prescription: Murder,' which was based onthe play _ I suspect it said a topcoat. I think you brought theraincoat.''</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   INCREDIBLY SIMILAR... Executive producer Woody Fraser says hisnew ABC show, ``Incredible Sunday,'' is not going to be just likehis old show, ``That's Incredible.'' Just compare the two premiereshows: Nine years ago, ``That's Incredible'' featured a forestranger who had been struck by lightning seven times, a doctor whodid something Fraser can't quite recall that involved coveringseven cheerleaders with bees, and a martial arts master who stuckneedles in his body, then hung buckets of sand from them. The newshow, premiering Oct. 9, will be toned down. It will have theAustralian who claims to be the real ```Crocodile'Dundee,'' a womanwho invented magnetic underwear to protect women from exposure toradiation, and a doctor who freezes embryos of endangered speciesfor implantation in surrogate mothers.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed PMs, Aug. 3</NOTE></DOC>
