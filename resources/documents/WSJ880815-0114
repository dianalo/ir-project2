The historic church at Broadway and Wall Street in lower Manhattan was burned down in 1776. Construction on the second Trinity began in August 1788. But on stamps issued July 27 in New York City, the church's spire stands tall above the date July 26, 1788 -- when the site remained in ruins.    &quot;The Postal Service has an obligation to posterity to depict the facts as they are,&quot; John Tauranac, a historian, complained in a letter to Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank. &quot;As the stamp now exists, it will go far in miseducating the public, which is a grave disservice -- one might even say, an engraved disservice.&quot;    His letter failed to move postal officials, who issued the stamp to mark the anniversary of New York's ratification of the U.S. Constitution -- an event that took place in Poughkeepsie, anyway.    Jack Williams of the Postal Service's stamp division said this 25-cent stamp is supposed to be &quot;reminiscent of an era,&quot; rather than representative of the city on a specific date. </TEXT></DOC>
