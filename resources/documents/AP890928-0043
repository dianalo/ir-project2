(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two American kestrels, theproduct of a surprise union of two injured birds in captivity, havebeen set free for a life in the wild.   The chicks' parents had been expected to languish in their homeat Dreher Park Zoo in West Palm Beach, but turned out to be veryactive.   ``We never expected them to reproduce,'' said Gail Schneider,zoo executive director. ``They came into captivity as adults.That's considered pretty stressful for them. So we didn't pay anyattention to their breeding behavior. And then, lo and behold, thefemale was sitting on eggs.''   She laid four eggs. One chick died. One broke a feather Tuesdayon its trip to the Everglades National Park, delaying its release.   That left a 4-month-old male and female from the threatenedspecies, the smallest member of the falcon family. The birds werereleased in the park Tuesday.</TEXT><NOTE>Eds: A version moved on the financial wire</NOTE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Darryl Hartley-Leonard, the latest doorman andbartender at the Hyatt Regency Chicago hotel, turned in hisuniforms and surrendered his tips after only one day on the job.
