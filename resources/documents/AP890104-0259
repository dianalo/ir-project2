The deal could nearly triple the fleet size of Braniff, a carrierwith 53 jets that has endured three changes of ownership, a Chapter11 bankruptcy reorganization, a major recapitalization and thetransfer of its major operations to Kansas City from Dallas in thepast six years. The airline has vowed to become a more competitiveforce in the industry.   ``Today's announcement, I think, takes us a giant step forwardtoward making that goal a reality,'' William McGee, Braniff'schairman, told a news conference in New York.   The move also represents one of the largest single orders forjets produced by Airbus, a European aircraft consortium that hasemerged as a major competitor against the U.S. giants of theindustry, Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.   The Airbus A320 is a 150-seat, highly efficient aircraft usedwidely to replace aging jets, which requires only two pilots in thecockpit rather than the customary three. It was unclear howBraniff's acquisition of these planes would affect previouslydisclosed plans to acquire 23 Boeing 737s from AMR Corp., parent ofAmerican Airlines.   ``It's a sizable infusion of new capacity in Braniff,'' saidRobert Joedicke, an airline analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.``It will certainly allow Braniff to rationalize and modernize theirfleet and be much more competitive.''   Braniff currently operates 25 Boeing 727s, 10 Boeing 737s and 18BAC-111s, built by British Aerospace PLC.   Last June, investment group BIA-COR Holdings Inc. acquiredDallas-based Braniff for $100 million from Dalfort Aviation Inc.,which is owned by the Pritzker family of Chicago. Through theinvestor group, PaineWebber Inc. controls a majority stake in theairline.   The group appointed five top executives from Piedmont Airlines tomanage Braniff. McGee, who had been Piedmont's chairman, helpedbuild that airline into the nation's ninth-largest carrier, and oneof the most profitable airlines, before it was acquired by USAirGroup Inc. in 1987.   Kevin Murphy, who follows the industry for Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.,suggested that the current team at Braniff could be beefing up theairline in preparation for selling it.   ``Our principal objective is to grow Kansas City,'' McGee toldthe news conference, referring to Braniff's main hub.   He said the airline may introduce international service fromKansas City as well as first class service on existing flights.McGee said he expects Braniff to join the ranks of the airlinemajors _ as measured by $1 billion or more in annual revenue _within a year and a half.   The carrier should become profitable by the end of this year, theBraniff chief projected.   Another airline analyst, who asked not to be identified, saidBraniff needs to guard against getting too big _ the predicamentwhich prompted its bankruptcy in 1982.   ``You don't try to dance with the elephants,'' he said.   McGee confirmed reports that the deal includes 16 planesoriginally intended for Pan Am Corp., which recently decided toscrap an order of A320s in exchange for a $115 million payment fromAirbus. Pan Am had a firm order for 16 of the aircraft and an optionon 34 more.   In a separate statement Wednesday, Pan Am also confirmed that ithad transferred the Airbus order to Braniff and announced that itwill buy up to four new Airbus A310-300 long-range planes instead.   ``While the A320 is a fine aircraft, our current route structureand our near-term scheduling plans do not require introduction ofthis aircraft type at this time,'' Pan Am Chairman Thomas G.Plaskett said.   Engines for the Airbus planes, which are included in the price,will be supplied by IAE International Aero Engines, a consortium ofU.S., British, West German, Japanese and Italian engine makers whichis based in East Hartford, Conn. The U.S. partner is Pratt andamp; WhitneyAircraft of East Hartford.   The deal would be worth the $3.5 billion only if Braniffexercises options to acquire all 100 planes. Airbus will sell thefirst 42 planes to a financing group, which will in turn lease themto Braniff. Airbus will have to make its own financing arrangementsfor the other eight in the first group of 50.   The members of the financing group are GPA Group Ltd. of Shannon,Ireland, an aircraft leasing company which has an option to buy 10percent of Braniff; Airbus; and the engine supplier, IAE.</TEXT></DOC>
