Boeing said All Nippon, Japan's second-largest airline, will take delivery of six of the jetliners in 1990 and 1991. The planes are part of a $1.25 billion order for 11 747s that All Nippon placed in November 1986. At the time, the contract stipulated that the airline would decide at a later date which models of the jumbo jet it would order. The 400 model has four fuel-efficient engines and an advanced cockpit that requires two crew members, one less than earlier models.    All Nippon has already taken delivery of two planes under the order, one the older 747-200 model, and the other a freighter. A Boeing spokesman wasn't certain of All Nippon's plans for the three remaining planes under the order that won't be the 400 model, although Boeing has been informed that at least one may be a freighter.    In Tokyo, an All Nippon spokesman said the airline intends to begin service to London next July and has negotiated a preliminary agreement with Austrian Airlines to jointly operate flights between Tokyo and Vienna. Both European routes still require an agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union that would permit flying over Soviet territory. </TEXT></DOC>
