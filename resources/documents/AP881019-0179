(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three defense contractors are about to embarkon a two-year, high-stakes competition to develop an unmanned spacerocket for the Air Force, industry officials say.   ``Whoever wins this business is certainly going to be at theforefront of the U.S. launch business for a long time to come,''said Vince Caluori, Boeing Aerospace's manager here for the programthe Air Force calls the Advanced Launch System.   Initial development contracts will be awarded ``any day now'' toBoeing, Martin Marietta Corp. and General Dynamics Corp., Air Forcespokesman Capt. Marty Hauser said earlier this week.   He would not confirm reports that each contract could be for $80million.   The Air Force wants a lightweight family of launch vehicles thatcan slash the cost of putting payloads in space. Under thedevelopment contracts, each company will have 25 months to submitplans to build a system that will meet the Air Force requirement oflifting up to 160,000 pounds of payload to an equatorial or polarorbit.   The winner of the development competition can expect billions ofdollars in business in the 1990s, as the Air Force moves toward afirst launch of the ALS late in that decade.   ``What ALS represents to us is really the whole next generationof launch vehicles,'' said Jeff Fisher, spokesman for MartinMarietta's Denver-based astronautics group. ``To stay in thisbusiness in the long term, ALS is critical.''   The Martin Marietta division, teamed with McDonnell DouglasAstronautics Co. for the competition, developed much of the Titanlaunch system for civilian and military satellites, a business thathas generated more than $4 billion.   Also hungry for the work is General Dynamics Space SystemsDivision of San Diego, which developed the upper-stage rockets forTitan, and the Atlas missile systems.   ``It's a very, very significant program,'' said General Dynamicsspokesman Jack Isabel. ``It's comparable to when the space shuttlegot under way.''   Boeing worked on the Saturn rocket booster for the Apollo mannedspace missions, Minuteman missiles, and the upper-stage booster forsatellites launched from the space shuttle. Still, it's been 15years since the Saturn program ended, a long time to be out of thespace rocket business.   ``Both our competitors have to be viewed as incumbents,''Caluori said. ``We think it's going to be one of the toughestcompetitions down the road that we've been involved in.''   Boeing so far has released one possible design, featuring awinged vehicle and booster rocket launched with sixliquid-propellant engines. The vehicle would use four aircraftengines to land back on earth.   General Dynamics' initial design calls for an all-liquidhydrogen and oxygen powered vehicle and booster rocket withoutwings. Martin Marietta has released three designs, includingall-expendable and partly recoverable versions.   The Air Force's goal is to make rocket launches as predictableas airplane flight, Caluori said.   The explosion of the space shuttle Challenger and otherpayload-launching setbacks have left the United States with a largebacklog of satellites waiting to be put into orbit. As a result,some companies have turned to foreign launchers such as Europe'sAriane system.</TEXT></DOC>
