Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and his counterpart,Sousuke Uno, were to give separate news conferences Wednesday beforeShevardnadze leaves for the Philippines, and officials of the twocountries were drafting a jiong communique.   But it appeared unlikely that progress could be realized on themajor issue blocking improved relations _ Soviet possession of theKuril islands off northern Japan that Tokyo insists should bereturned.   The only positive sign was a possibility that the two countrieswould agree to continue talks at the official level on the dispute,which dates back to World War II.   ``Neither side has shown concessions, so the positions are stillfar apart,'' Seiichi Kondo, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman,told reporters in a review of two days of talks between the twoforeign ministers.   Shevardnadze, in a speech Tuesday night to a private group,called for an improvement in relations.   ``We can open up a new chapter in the history of Soviet-Japaneserelations, and then again they must be opened up,'' he said. ``Ifthere are problems that cannot be solved between us, we must searchfor the clue to a solution through talks, dialogue.''   A Japanese Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said Uno was likely to visit Moscow for renewed talks inthe first half of 1989.   Kondo said the Soviets had suggested the two countries studymeasures to encourage economic cooperation, such as agreements toprotect investments and set guidelines on economic relations.   The Japanese replied that, in addition to problems in the Sovietinvestment climate, ``the overall situation of bilateral relationsis not suitable for further promotion of investment,'' Kondo said.   His report on the talks appeared to dash speculation that aSoviet need for Japanese investment to help develop the Sovieteconomy _ especially the vast and resource-rich Siberian region inthe Soviet Far East _ would spur progress on the territorial issue.   Kondo said the two foreign ministers' talks on the territorialissue were ``frank, serious and heated.''   Moscow has consolidated its occupation of the Kurils, which guardMoscow's access to the Pacific, with 10,000 troops. Japan maintainsthat it pioneered settlement of the islands _ 17,000 Japaneseresidents were ousted by invading Soviet troops in 1945 _ and has ahistoric claim to them.   Earlier, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita urged Shevardnadze togive ``serious consideration'' to the territorial dispute, a ForeignMinistry official said.   Takeshita said resolution of the dispute ``would be the basis forpermanent and stable relations.''   Shevardnadze met with the Japanese prime minister to deliver aletter from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The contents ofthe letter were not made public.   Shevardnadze said Gorbachev has a trip to Japan on his politicalschedule and that Takeshita was welcome to visit Moscow, theJapanese official said. No dates were mentioned.   In a 1956 Japan-Soviet joint declaration, Moscow announced itswillingness to return two of the islands upon conclusion of a peacetreaty.   But at the last Japan-Soviet summit in 1973, talks between thenPrime Minister Kakuei Tanaka and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev brokedown over the issue. Shevardnadze refused to discuss it during hislast visit to Japan in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
