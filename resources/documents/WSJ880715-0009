They are just two of the hundreds of Louisiana boards and commissions that regulate, advise and oversee everything from birth (the Commission on Perinatal Care) to death (the Louisiana Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors.)    Gov. Buddy Roemer wants to get rid of scores of these panels as part of his effort to streamline state government. Some of the boards and commissions rarely -- if ever -- meet, while others duplicate responsibilities.    But the governor is finding that entities such as the Louisiana Cemetery Board die hard. State legislators, who look on board appointments as political plums, have succeeded so far in foiling his efforts.    &quot;A lot of these boards are just not needed,&quot; says David Kemerly, the governor's point man in the effort to whittle down the panels. &quot;It's part of the old system of political patronage. . . . The governor had more appointments to make, and the legislators could get the credit for them.&quot;    Who, after all, wouldn't want to claim credit for appointing members to the Fertilizer Board, the College and University Livestock Sale Committee, the Louisiana Pork Promotion Board or the Advisory Committee on the Regulation and Control of Water Well Diggers?    Then there's the Task Force on Reef Management of Oyster Propagating Areas, the Task Force on Shrimp Management and, of course, the State Board of Electrolysis Examiners.    Gov. Roemer's first effort to kill 125 panels outright died in the legislature earlier this year. A second effort, to have 354 boards explain what they do and then let legislators vote whether to abolish them, is holding its own, but just barely. Already, legislators have exempted more than 80 boards.    &quot;All we'd ask is for the board to come forward and justify its existence,&quot; Mr. Kemerly says. &quot;If they can, there's no problem.&quot;    Maybe the governor could be accused of being a bit overzealous. In the bill to streamline the panels, the Board of Commissions for the Promotion of Uniformity in Legislation in the U.S. is listed twice, under separate headings. </TEXT></DOC>
