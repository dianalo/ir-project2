Moscow hasestablished full diplomatic relations with Israel for the first time since1967.;   The basis of the talks, as Bush outlined them on Wednesday, is theresolution adopted by U.N.

However, aninternational peace conference that was to involve all the parties never gotoff the ground.;   The 1978 Camp David talks, sponsored by President JimmyCarter, were the previous notable attempt to find a basis for regional peace.But only Israel and Egypt signed on.;   Carter, Prime Minister Menachem Beginof Israel and President Anwar Sadat of Egypt agreed that Jordan shouldrepresent the Palestinian people to negotiate autonomy for the Arabpopulations of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but Jordan never steppedforward.;   Palestinians in the occupied territories deferred to the PLO andnever joined in either.;   The PLO refused to recognize Israel's right toexist, and Israel rejected any contacts with the organization it regarded as aband of terrorists.;   Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982, followed bySyrian attacks against mainline PLO forces, routed the Palestinians. PresidentReagan seized the moment to offer his own peace initiative, calling for Israelto give up occupied territory to be used for a Palestinian homeland inconfederation with Jordan.;   Israel, angered that Reagan announced hisinitiative without first advising them, rejected the proposal out of hand, andSecretary of State George Shultz never found any serious interest, despiteseveral trips to the Middle East.;   Palestinians were never able tocapitalize on the worldwide sympathy after the 1982 Lebanese massacre ofPalestinians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Chatilla in Israeli-heldterritory on Beirut's outskirts.;   Shultz failed the following year to win aSyrian withdrawal from Lebanon in conjunction with the Israelis' pullout frommost of the country.;   When PLO chief Yasser Arafat in 1988 finally accededto U.S. pressure to accept Israel's right to exist, the United States begandirect talks with the organization, but nothing developed.
