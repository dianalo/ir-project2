The government censorship board also lifted the ban on ``A DryWhite Season,'' an anti-apartheid movie starring Donald Sutherlandand Marlon Brando, made in the United States and based on a novelby South African Andre Brink.   The Publication Appeals Board banned Mandela's autobiography,``The Struggle Is My Life,'' three years ago.   Mandela was released Feb. 11 after 27 years in prison for hisrole in launching the bombing and sabotage campaign of the AfricanNational Congress. He continues to support the ANC's armedstruggle, although it has been largely dormant the past year.   ``As far as the principle of armed violence is concerned,(Mandela's) standpoint is so well known that it is unlikely it willchange the outlook of the reader toward political violence,'' theAppeals Board said in its judgment.   Other books about Mandela and the ANC have been available inSouth Africa for several years.   Speaking about ``A Dry White Season,'' the panel said in astatement: ``The board believes this film is a serious one whichaddresses the sensitive relations between white and black in SouthAfrica.   ``In the board's opinion, it attempts to improve theserelations: sadly it often loses its effect by falling intopropaganda.''   The film was screened at a South African film festival last yearbut was banned from general circulation.   It concerns a series of injustices suffered by a black family atthe hands of white authorities. A white teacher, played bySutherland, becomes involved and unsuccessfully seeks redressthrough the courts.   Another anti-apartheid film, ``Cry Freedom,'' is scheduled toreopen in South Africa on April 27.   The board approved the film in July 1988, but police used theirpowers under the national state of emergency to confiscate it fromtheaters the day it opened, saying it posed a threat to publicsafety.   The distributors said police returned the copies of the filmrecently.   ``Cry Freedom'' is about black activist Steve Biko, who died inpolice custody in 1977, and Donald Woods, a white newspaper editorwho had befriended him.</TEXT></DOC>
