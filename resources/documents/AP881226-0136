But in the United States, it wasn't until asurgeon general's report 25 years ago that a methodical scientificindictment was drawn up. Since then, anti-smoking attitudes andcampaigns have steadily gathered force and produced striking change.</TEXT><BYLINE>By JOHN BARBOUR</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   For the employers of the Marlboro Man and the vast majority ofAmericans who found comfort and contemplation in smoke rings, thewarnings had been clear, and the formal announcement of 1964 came asno big surprise.   Twenty-five years ago next Wednesday, after 14 months of studying8,000 scientific reports, Surgeon General Luther Terry's blue-ribbonpanel announced that smoking was bad and ``a health hazard ofsufficient importance in the United States to warrant appropriateremedial action.''   Statistically linked to lung cancer, heart disease, stroke andvarious malignancies of the throat and mouth, smoking was calledhealth enemy No. 1.   Remedial action began benignly enough: warnings on cigarettepacks that reminded the fatalistic smoker that he could be killinghimself.   But in the ensuing years it has become a new kind of uncivil warwhich smokers see as a bullying campaign against individual rightsand many non-smokers see as a crusade in which their health andwell-being is at stake, not to mention their carpets and coffeetables that in years past were vulnerable to falling ash and embers.   Back in 1964, at an accelerating yearly pace, more than 70million adult Americans in a population of 192 million smoked morethan 523 billion cigarettes, 7.1 billion cigars and used more than150 million pounds of tobacco in other forms, a pipeful, a chaw or adip of snuff.   These days, after 2{ decades of warnings and repressions, some 55million to 60 million Americans smoke out of a population of somemillion. They smoke 575 billion cigarettes a year, some 4 billion ofvarious types of cigars and cigarillos, and they use a little lessthan 150 million pounds of tobacco in other forms.   They smoke less per capita today, but spend a lot more for it.Most hotels and airports charge nearly $2 a pack, and the pricewould make a World War II smoker (18 cents a pack) choke before hetook a drag.   In 1964, smokers spent $8 billion on the ugly habit, some $3.3billion of which went to federal, state and local governments astaxes. Today they spend $35.5 billion on tobacco, and almost $10billion is collected as tax.   All of this in the face of a nationwide campaign that has bannedsmoking in many federal buildings, work places, restaurants,airplanes, trains and rest rooms. In terms of a regulation andeducational programs, the scale is unprecedented, save forprohibition, and the stated aims by health authorities are moreambitious than any attempt to persuade people to change such aningrained habit.   Three years ago, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop announced heexpected a smoke-free society by the year 2000.   ``This is not a prohibitive society,'' he said. ``We're not goingto tell people they can't smoke. We learned that we can't tellpeople they can't drink.''   They can, however, devise tactics to isolate and then eliminatethe habit.   Smelling victory, the surgeon general put on a smile andsuggested that outdoor smoking be mandated in the spring ``and bythe time cold weather comes, it will be well-ingrained in theirhabits and they won't come in to smoke.''   Backed by ``the whole grass-roots movement of militantnon-smokers,'' he said:   ``I think the person that smokes in 1995 is going to smoke aloneor with other smokers. That might be in his bathroom or his backyard or in a segregated area. I wouldn't be surprised to see it outof doors.''   Even now, the smoker can sense his growing isolation.   Smokers have felt the elbow in their backs at their local,formerly friendly bars and were asked to move the ashtray. This issomething like asking the altar boy to douse the incense in church.   The federal government finds itself on the horns of a dilemma. Itactually controls the growing of tobacco by allotting acreage to180,000 farms in 23 states and Puerto Rico. This stabilizesproduction and insures price levels. The Commodity Credit Corp.lends farmers money against the value of their crops, the loansbeing repaid as the tobacco is sold. For many farms, tobacco is theone stable factor in an otherwise unpredictable market. Consider:   Wheat last year yielded $96 an acre. Soybeans yielded $183,cotton $459, peanuts $632, feed corn $202 and sweet corn $724.Tobacco yielded $3,206 per acre.   For many states it is a prime cash crop. North Carolina reaped$738 million last year, Kentucky $514 million, South Carolina $151million and so on down the line to West Virginia which reaped $4million.   The tobacco industry employs almost 57,000 people who feed theproduct to just short of 1 million retail outlets that includealmost 619,000 vending machines.   The United States exports $3.4 billion worth of tobacco a year,more than any other country, and the figures grow every year.   So Uncle Sam condemns the weed, hems in its users, yet encouragesits cultivation and its export.   Anti-smoking forces, the white hats, while chastising the smokerfor his foolish habit, see him as the victim of sinister forces, theblack hats, the tobacco industry.   Lori Heise, writing in World Watch, a product of the WorldwatchInstitute, which tries to keep its fingers on the ills of the world,lambastes what she calls the ``unhealthy alliance'' betweengovernment and the industry.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
