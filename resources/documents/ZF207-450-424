(includes product table andrelated articles on RISC chip acceleration and motherboardreplacement)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Bel Bruno, Ron.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The accelerator-board market has been weakened by the introductionof low-cost systems that make buying a completely new systemeasier and more cost-effective than upgrading an older machine.andO;Manufacturers have responded by cutting prices and introducingfeatures which make the boards easier to operate.andP;  Boards whichreplace existing system RAM became uneconomical when memory pricesrose, leading some manufacturers to develop boards that use asmall amount of RAM for caching.andP;  New 80386SX boards, unlike 80286boards, can run 32-bit software such as Windows 386 and Paradox386.andP;  The release of the 80486 chip will result in new acceleratorboards which are easily integrated with existing 386-basedsystems, but the chip likely to see limited use because it is toopowerful for the PC-AT architecture.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Performance ImprovementAccelerator Boards-CardsAdd-In-On DevicesProcessor SpeedSystem Selection.andO;Feature:   illustrationtablegraph.andO;Caption:   An accelerator board sampler.
