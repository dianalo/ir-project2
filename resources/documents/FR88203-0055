Appearance for Agency: Thomas C. Barbour, Esq., Attorney-Advisor, Officeof the Deputy Chief Counsel for Export Administration, U.S. Departmentof Commerce, Room H-3329, Washington, DC 20230.  Preliminary Statement  On October 28, 1986, the Office of Export Enforcement (OEE), United StatesDepartment of Commerce (Agency), issued an amended charging letter to RespondentSven Olof Hakanson, individually and doing business as Sunitron, A.B. (hereinaftercollectively referred to as ``Respondents'') \1\<NOTE/>. The amended charging letter alleges that Respondents violatedandSection;andSection; 387.4 and 387.6 of the Export Administration Regulations(15 CFR Parts 368-399), (the Regulations). The amended charging letter,dated October 28, 1986, was served on Respondents on April 2, 1987.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ An initial charging letter was issued by the Agency onJuly 21, 1986. Respondents filed an answer to that charging letter on August16, 1986, admitting certain allegations and denying others. On September19, 1986, Agency Counsel's petition to amend the charging letter was granted.The amended charging letter deletes allegations and names relating to aconspiracy but does not alter the basic charges.  Respondents filed an answer to the initial charging letter on August 15,1986. They have not filed a supplemental answer to the amended chargingletter. Neither party has requested a hearing in this matter. Agency Counselhas moved for judgment on the record, pursuant to andSection; 388.14 of theRegulations, which provides for adjudications on the record without a hearing.The present posture of the case is also consistent with a default, pursuantto andSection; 388.8 of the Regulations, for failure to answer the outstandingamended charging letter. Since the procedure for both is the same, bothsections are cited as the basis for this action.  Facts  In the amended charging letter of October 28, 1986, the Agency allegedthat, between on or about January 11, 1980 and on or about November 1,1982, Respondents, in two separate transactions, reexported a total ofsix U.S.-origin computers from the Federal Republic of Germany (F.R.G.)through Sweden to the United Soviet of Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.). Between January 11, 1980 and November 15, 1981, Respondents purchased twoU.S.-origin computers from a supplier in the F.R.G. Respondents reexportedthese two U.S.-origin computers from the F.R.G. through Sweden to the U.S.S.R.In a second transaction occurring between April 15, 1981 and November 1,1982, Respondents reexported four additional U.S.-origin computers fromthe F.R.G. through Sweden to the U.S.S.R.  The charging letter further states that between approximately January 1,1983 and May 30, 1983, Respondents purchased three U.S.-origin computersfrom a Swedish company and reexported those computers from Sweden to Czechoslovakiawithout obtaining the reexport authorization from the Agency.  Each of the above-described transactions was undertaken by Respondentswithout the reexport authorization from the Agency which Respondents knewor had reason to know that such authorization, was required by andSection;374.1 of the Regulations. Accordingly, by engaging in the three transactionsdescribed above, Respondents violated andSection;andSection; 387.4 and 387.6of the Regulations, as alleged in the amended charging letter of October28, 1986. Each of those violations involved U.S.-origin goods controlledunder section 5 of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50U.S.C. app. 2401-2420 (1982 and Supp. III 1985)) (the Act), for nationalsecurity reasons.  In their answer, Respondents admit, the allegations of the amended chargingletter, that they reexported, in two separate shipments, a total of sixU.S.-origin computers which they had purchased from a supplier in the F.R.G.,from the F.R.G. through Sweden to the U.S.S.R. They also admit that theyreexported, from Sweden to Czechoslovakia, three U.S.-origin computers.Further, Respondents admit that they did not have authority from the Agencyto reexport these computers to the ultimate end-user. Thus, in accordancewith andSection; 388.7 of the Regulations, Respondents' answer constitutesan admission that they committed three violations of andSection; 387.6 ofthe Regulations (three transactions involving the reexport of U.S.-origincomputers within the reexport authorization required by andSection; 374.1of the Regulations).  Discussion  While they admit to reexporting U.S.-orgin computers to the U.S.S.R. andCzechoslovakia without reexport authorization from the Agency, Respondentsassert in their answer that they were unaware of any such reexport requirement.Thus, the only question in this proceeding is whether Respondents alsoviolated andSection; 387.4 of the Regulations in committing the above-describedviolations.Respondents' defense to the Agency's allegation that they violated andSection;387.4 of the Regulations is that they ``had no reason to believe, thatsuch a permission was necessary * * *.'' Agency Counsel contends that statementsmade by Respondent Hakanson in connection with the Agency's investigation,as well as statements made by him in other contexts, show Respondents'``defense'' to be a sham.Agency Counsel particularly cites an interview with an OEE Special Agenton October 1, 1985, in which Respondent Hakanson expounded at length regardingboth his knowledge of U.S. export control laws and his involvement in aseries of transactions, including the transactions identified in the amendedcharging letter (Exh. 1). In that interview, Respondent Hakanson admittedto conspiring with two other individuals, in the 1979-1980 time frame,to violate U.S. export control laws. He further admitted that during thattime period he and his co-conspirators specifically discussed U.S. exportcontrol laws and stated that they were all ``fully aware that U.S. regulationswere going to be violated'' in connection with their contemplated activities.While that statement alone is sufficient to support a finding that Respondents``knew or had reason to know'' of the requirements of the Act and the Regulations,including the reexport requirements, the interview also establishes thatRespondents were specifically aware in 1980 that U.S. export control lawsprohibited the export or reexport of U.S.-origin computers to the U.S.S.R.\2\<NOTE/> Hakanson also admitted to being aware of the restrictionon the transfer of U.S.-origin computers to the U.S.S.R. during an investigationundertaken by a Swedish County Prosecutor, (Exh. 2) and in an interviewsubmitted by the Respondents in a related administrative proceeding. (Exh.3)<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ On January 11, 1980, the Agency issued a General Ordersuspending all outstanding validated export licenses or other authorizationsfor export to the U.S.S.R. would be issued, pending review and revisionof U.S. policy in light of Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. (45 FR 3027,January 18, 1980) The General Order is the ``U.S. embargo laws [<T3>sic</T3>]'' referenced in the report of interview.Agency Counsel argues, and I agree that Exh. 1-3 clearly establish thatHakanson knew or had reason to know of the reexport requirements of theAct and the Regulations. In fact, Hakanson acted in clear disregard ofthe Act and the Regulations in carrying out the transactions identifiedin the amended charging letter.Based on the above findings of fact, I conclude that an Order denying Respondents'U.S. export privileges for a period of 20 years from the date a final orderbecomes effective by being entered in this proceeding.\3\<NOTE/> The final order in these proceedings will constitute thefinal administrative disposition and action, on these charges, againstRespondents.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ I do not concur in Agency counsel's suggestion of an ``indefinite''denial period. The practice, started over a decade ago, of fixing definiteperiods appears to be better from a denied party's viewpoint. The use ofthe term ``indefinite'' is also questioned. Formerly the word ``permanent''was used in these sanctions. ``Indefinite'' was reserved for situationswhereby answering interrogatories or some other such action on the partof the Respondent could effect the removal of the cause of the denial andlead to the restoration of export privileges.OrderI. For a period of 20 years from the date of the final Agency action, RespondentsSven Olof Hakanson, individually and doing business as Sunitron A.B., Hagtornsvagen2-4, 183-62 Taby, Sweden,<ITAG tagnum="10">and all successors, or assignees, officers, partners, representatives,agents, and employees hereby are denied all privileges of participating,directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity, in any transaction involvingcommodities or technical data exported from the United States in wholeor in part, or to be exported, or that are otherwise subject to the Regulations.II.
