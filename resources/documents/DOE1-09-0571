<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-09-0571 </DOCNO><TEXT>A Safeguards Control and Communication System (SCCS) has been developedfor a facility based on existing modular SCCS software for another facility.The majority of FORTRAN 77 software modules were directly carried overfrom one SCCS to the other with only minor modifications for site-specificconsiderations. Therefore, savings in time and money for design, development,fabrication, and documentation were realized. Two significant hardwarechanges were made in the SCCS which accounted for most of the softwaredevelopment. The Alarm Multiplexer Communication System (AMCS) was usedinstead of the Loop Multiplexer Communication System (LMCS) for alarmreporting. The Tektronix M4125 color graphic system was used in placeof the Advanced Electronics Design 512 color graphic system for the displayof system status and information. A map editor has been written for theTektronix M4125 which facilitates the development and modification ofdisplays. Substitution of these systems enhanced the flexibility of theSCCS because common problems in physical protection system developmentare addressed.</TEXT></DOC>
