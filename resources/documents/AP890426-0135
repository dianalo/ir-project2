The photos of Khashoggi, 54, were dated April 18, the day he wasarrested in Bern on a U.S. warrant charging he helped hide assetsthat deposed President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and hiswife Imelda allegedly stole from their country.   The photos were apparently leaked to the press, and Swissauthorities have launched a judicial investigation to determinewhether their publication was illegal, according to Bern'sinvestigating judge, Alexander Tschaepaett.   Markus Schneider, a Bern police spokesman, confirmed the photoswere from police files but said they had not been officiallypublished.   Khashoggi's attorneys say they plan to ask Switzerland's highestcourt this week for his immediate release.   U.S. officials have said they will ask for Khashoggi'sextradition to face racketeering and other charges. A New Yorkcourt has indicted him for allegedly posing as the owner of art andproperty that the Marcoses allegedly plundered from the Philippinesbefore Marcos was ousted as president.   Khashoggi also was allegedly the main middleman and financier inthe Iran-Contra affair and has been involved in several kickbackscandals.   His name also has been mentioned by Pamella Bordes, a formercall girl and researcher in Britain's Parliament whose sex andscandal memoirs involving rich and powerful men around the worldwere serialized by the London tabloid.   One installment contained lurid tales of sexusal encounters withKhashoggi, with a Saudi prince and with a cousin of Libya's leader,Col. Moammar Gadhafi.   In its Wednesday editions, the Swiss tabloid Blick quoted alocal government official as estimating that Khashoggi's stay injail costs taxpayers $55 a day, excluding meals.   ``The billionaire has never before lived so cheaply,'' thenewspaper said.   Swiss officials say Khashoggi receives no special treatment inthe downtown Bern jail which is reserved for people in pretrialpreventive detention.   His cell measures 30 square feet and is furnished with a bed,table, chair, sink and toilet. He can wear his own clothes andorder out for meals.   His jail cell is near the luxury Schweizerhof hotel where he wasstaying before his arrest. He has had some of his meals deliveredfrom the hotel.</TEXT></DOC>
