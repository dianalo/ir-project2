Madar, president and chief executive officer.    The maker of equipment for applying adhesives, sealants, paints and coatings sells more than half its machines abroad and is benefiting from the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar.    Mr. Madar declined to be specific about expected profits for the year.    As previously reported, profit for the second quarter, ended May 3, rose 90% to $7.2 million, or 68 cents a share, from $3.8 million, or 37 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales jumped 32% to $55 million from $41.8 million.    The company is seeking small acquisitions that would provide new technology or products that fit into existing markets, Mr. Madar said. The company had $23.9 million of cash and marketable securities on May 3, a major part of which could be used for acquisitions, he said.    Nordson split its stock 3-for-2 effective April 30. There are 10.3 million shares outstanding.    The board last November authorized the purchase of as many as 600,000 of its shares, after adjustment for the split, over the next five years. Less than 20% of that amount has been repurchased to date, partly because of the strength in the stock price.    Nordson stock has risen in price by more than 50%, after adjusting for the split, since the repurchase authorization. </TEXT></DOC>
