However, these batteries require numerous inspectionsand a great deal of manpower to maintain them. Therefore, reduction oflabor involved in those maintenance has been requested. Sealed lead-acidbatteries with a large capacity and a long life have been developed fortelecommunications applications. They are safe and easily maintained.They have a maximum capacity of 3,000 Ah and are designed to have a lifeof over 10 years. Parameters such as plate thickness and electrolytespecific gravity were determined to attain the specified performanceand life. Adhesives and rubber valves are made of reliable materials.Flame-retardant resin is applied to the battery container. Performancetests in laboratory and in telephone offices have confirmed that thesealed lead-acid batteries exhibit satisfactory characteristics and aresufficiently suited to telecommunications applications.</TEXT></DOC>
