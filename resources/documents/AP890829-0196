If Nationalists emerge with their power intact from the ballotingthis coming Wednesday, overcoming unparalleled challenges from whiteopposition parties on the left and far right, they will have amandate for their pledge to bring blacks into the political systemon a limited basis by the end of the new Parliament's five-year term.   Anti-apartheid activists say the Nationalists' promise is vague,however, and hope to force the government to the bargaining tablewithin a much shorter period to arrange for a one-person, one-votesystem.   The activists have conducted a nationwide civil disobediencecampaign to coincide with the campaign and have urged mixed-race andIndian voters to boycott the elections for Parliament's two separatejunior chambers, the 80-seat body for mixed-race representatives andthe 40-seat chamber for Indians.   ``The racist elections will not determine our future,'' said JayNaidoo, general-secretary of the militant Congress of South AfricanTrade Unions. ``We will determine our own future.''   The man who will decide how to confront this spirit of resistanceis almost certain to be F.W. de Klerk, the National Party leader whobecame acting president Aug. 15 after P.W. Botha's forcedresignation. If his party retains control of Parliament's dominantwhite chamber, the 53-year-old Klerk will be elected for a five-yearterm as president.   De Klerk's immediate challenge is to ensure that his partysurvives its toughest electoral threat since taking power in 1948.Several polls have suggested the possibility of a ``hungParliament,'' with the far-right Conservative Party and liberalDemocratic Party each gaining enough seats to deprive theNationalists of an outright majority.   In the outgoing Parliament, the National Party controls 123 ofthe 166 elected seats in the white chamber, the Conservatives 22 andthe Democrats 20. One seat is held by a member of a now-defunctmoderate party.   In the most recent white election, in 1987, the Nationalists wonabout 52 percent of the vote, right-wing candidates 30 percent andliberals 18 percent. According to polls, the National Party isvirtually certain to get less than half the white votes this time,although it could maintain control of Parliament even if its shareof votes drops toward 40 percent.   A poll commissioned in late July by the country's largestnewspaper, The Sunday Times, suggested the Nationalists could bereduced to 78 seats, with Conservatives winning 52 and the Democrats36. A party needs 84 seats to rule on its own.   One of de Klerk's deputies, Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen,said the Nationalists would prefer calling another election, ratherthan govern in a coalition with either rival party.   ``We will go back to the voters and say make up your mind,''Viljoen said. ``If you don't want us, rather kick us out and choosea single, strong government.''   No polls are allowed in the final four weeks before a nationalelection in South Africa, and thus there have been few means ofmeasuring the political impact of Botha's bitter resignation. Bothaobjected to de Klerk's plans to confer with President Kenneth Kaundaof Zambia, one of black Africa's most vocal critics of apartheid.   Initially, commentators said the showdown would help theConservative Party, which shared Botha's objections to the deKlerk-Kaunda meeting. But National Party officials say de Klerk hadproved his mettle and held to his commitment to pursue dialogue evenwith opponents.   In contrast to the tempermental Botha, de Klerk is viewed as apersonable pragmatist who will work energetically to lessen SouthAfrica's international isolation. He is likely to benefit from theimpending independence of Namibia after 74 years years of SouthAfrican rule and the increasing tendency of southern African leadersto favor negotiation over confrontation.   But both white opposition parties have assailed de Klerk and hisparty on grounds that they are attempting to straddle difficultdomestic issues with ambiguous, evasive positions.   Asked whether a black could become president, for example, theConservatives say no and the Democrats say yes. The Nationalistsduck the question.   Similarly, de Klerk's declarations that he opposes discriminationhave been undercut by harsh police crackdowns on black activistsdefying segregation laws on whites-only beaches and buses.   The country's myriad economic problems also have providedammunition for the opposition parties. Many whites feel they arefighting a losing battle against high taxes and inflation, and aseries of corruption cases involving Nationalist politicians hasserved to heighten the anger.   ``Forty-one years is long enough,'' said Denis Worrall, a formerambassador to Britain who is one of the Democrats' three co-leaders.``Only a new party, untainted by apartheid and economic failure,will inspire the confidence internationally to turn this countryaround.''   The Conservative Party says de Klerk's five-year plan will leadinevitably to black majority rule and hopes to score major gains inrural and blue-collar districts with its call for strictersegregation. It has boasted of surmounting black consumer boycottsthat were launched to protest the reintroduction of hardlinesegregation laws by Conservative-controlled councils in theindustrial city of Boksburg and the mining town of Carletonville.   ``The white community's right to self-determination isnon-negotiable,'' says the Conservatives' manifesto.   But Nationalist leaders believe their policies accurately reflectthe sentiments of most of South Africa's 5 million whites. While thewhites generally want to ease racial tensions and win blackcooperation, they also want to protect white power and whiteprivileges, including segregated neighborhoods and schools.   ``The Conservative Party tries to cling to white domination, andthis will never be acceptable to people of color,'' de Klerk said ina recent speech. ``The Democratic Party's proposals will lead to theusurping of power (by blacks) and this will never be acceptable tothe whites.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday, Sept. 3</NOTE></DOC>
