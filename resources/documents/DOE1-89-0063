The material hada higher elasticity modulus and fatigue strength than fiberglass-epoxyand consequently yields a smaller strap size and greater stiffness thanthe fiberglass. The more optimized strap orientation provides greaterstrap length and thermal resistance and the alumina provides about 50%higher resonance frequency. Thermal performance predictions were comparedfor the COBE dewar 1) as built, 2) with fiberglass-epoxy straps in anoptimized configuration, and 3) with alumina-epoxy straps in an optimizedconfiguration. The optimized designs gave a predicted cryogen lifetimeimprovement of about 50%.</TEXT></DOC>
