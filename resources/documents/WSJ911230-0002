For all the talk that it would lead to hiring quotas, thenew federal civil-rights law may largely affect most managersin a different way: It probably will spur businesses tooverhaul the ways they promote and dismiss executives.</LP><TEXT>   Smart male managers will drop the age-old pattern ofpromoting people &quot;in their own image,&quot; says Ken Martin, amanaging director for consultants Hay Group. The law alsowill encourage wider use of alternative-dispute mechanisms,such as arbitration, to settle workplace feuds because thetactics offer a cheaper, quicker alternative to costly andclogged courts.   The Civil Rights Act passed last month extends punitivedamages and jury trials for the first time to victims ofemployment discrimination based on their sex, disability orreligion. Some business groups worried it would forceemployers to hire fixed percentages of women or the disabled.   But comparatively few people complain about allegedlyunfair hiring these days. Nearly 61% of the bias chargesfiled with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission infiscal 1990 targeted advancement and discharge decisions.Only 8.6% aimed at hiring.   &quot;This {law} will cause companies to get as rigorous aboutinternal selection as they've had to be on externalselection,&quot; says David Nadler, president of Delta ConsultingGroup Inc. Otherwise, management specialists say, businesseswill have trouble justifying their promotions to juries --especially decisions based on tradition or stereotypesinstead of job-related criteria.   The new federal statute limits the size of punitivedamages to a maximum of $300,000. But &quot;the caps will be gone&quot;following anticipated legal challenges or correctivelegislation, predicts Lawrence Lorber, a partner with Kelley,Drye andamp; Warren in Washington, D.C. &quot;You {then} can haverunaway juries,&quot; he says, plus huge awards such as onebrought at the state level against Texaco Inc.   In early October, a jury in a California court granted aTexaco manager about $17.7 million, including $15 million inpunitive damages, after she claimed she had been twice passedover for promotion in favor of men. The oil company intendsto appeal the verdict, touted as the largest amount everawarded in a U.S. sex-bias case. (Courts in only a fewstates, however, have granted generous sums injob-discrimination cases.)   The Texaco case and the civil-rights law &quot;should give alot of executives pause&quot; before they advance people usingrules &quot;based on a white, male managerial work force,&quot; saysAnn Morrison, a research manager at the Center for CreativeLeadership in Greensboro, N.C. Agrees Mr. Lorber, who says heis busy advising worried major corporate clients: &quot;There willbe a big-time focus on their succession planning.&quot;   Sophisticated employers fearful of bias suits probablywill try harder to promote women into senior posts,management attorneys believe. Concerns will imitatepacesetters such as Xerox Corp., AMR Corp. and BaxterInternational Inc., whose efforts have been propelled largelyby changing demographics in the work force.   Xerox, long praised for boosting careers of minorities,now is attacking subtle roadblocks to women's upwardmobility. An informal network of six senior femaleexecutives, convened by Xerox Chairman Paul A. Allaire inearly 1990, is helping to knock down such barriers. Thenetwork complained, for instance, about purportedlyaggressive male definitions (such as leadership: &quot;an intensedesire to win&quot;) used when Xerox gauged someone's managementpotential. The company switched to what was seen as a moresex-neutral definition: &quot;intense desire to succeed.&quot;   The senior women also urged Mr. Allaire to include afemale's point of view during yearly management reviews ofsuccession and career-development plans. So, last spring hetold operating units to add a woman to such reviews even ifnone served on their top management teams. The idea was &quot;toprovide more diversity . . . than an all-male perspectivewould normally supply,&quot; his directive said.   Anne Mulcahy, Xerox's human-resources director forcorporate operations, was the sole woman at somesuccession-planning sessions. At one session last summer,male executives challenged a capable woman's chances ofmoving into corporate finance because she lacked financialexperience (although she held an M.B.A. degree in the field).Ms. Mulcahy agreed that &quot;you don't want to roll the dice onsomeone who is unproven,&quot; especially in tough times. Butwomen only will advance into senior management, she noted,when men are &quot;willing to take some risks.&quot; The men finallyagreed to consider the employee for a future financeassignment.   In the wake of the Civil Rights Act and a U.S. SupremeCourt decision last May, other employers are taking a closerlook at the dozens of major concerns -- including Aetna Lifeandamp; Casualty Co., Northrop Corp. and Security Pacific Bank ofArizona, a Security Pacific Corp. unit -- that usealternative dispute-resolution tactics to settle employmentfeuds faster than courtrooms.   The Supreme Court agreed that securities firms may requirearbitration of registered brokers' age-bias claims. Businessorganizations saw the ruling as the first step toward adecision upholding agreements to arbitrate alljob-discrimination disputes. Two federal appeals courts havesince extended the decision to sex-bias claims in thesecurities industry.   Some attorneys now are urging corporate clients to requirearbitration agreements when staff members join or advanceinto management.   But women, the disabled and other individuals with newlywon chances for substantial cash awards in federal job-biassuits may oppose mandatory arbitration requirements. &quot;I justthink that every American has the right to use the judicialsystem,&quot; says Linda Willis, a 44-year-old former broker andassistant manager for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Lexington,K.Y. She sued Dean Witter last year, alleging that thesecurities firm had forced her to resign because of her sex.Last month, an appeals court upheld Dean Witter's bid tocompel arbitration over her claim.   Fearing such resistance, Northrop has considered butdecided against requiring arbitration. Its grievanceprocedure includes voluntary, company-paid arbitration formost of its 31,000 employees in southern California. &quot;Wedon't want people to think that all of a sudden we are goingto put handcuffs on them when they seek redress,&quot; saysPatrick Wilson, industrial-relations director for the bigdefense contractor. Fewer than 12 of the approximately 250employee grievances brought yearly lead to arbitration.   Similarly, Aetna Life andamp; Casualty prefers nonbindingmediation, and has settled more than 15% of its employmentcomplaints this way in recent years. Mediators sometimescraft more creative solutions than courts, says Wayne Slitt,a corporate counsel. That's crucial when &quot;what's important tothe plaintiff isn't just money.&quot;   One white, middle-aged manager fired for poor performancethreatened to sue Aetna for age discrimination. Shortlyafter, the Hartford, Conn., insurer closed the man's oldoffice for economic reasons. A mediator proposed -- and Aetnaagreed -- to give the manager severance pay and to tellpotential employers that he had been laid off rather thandischarged.   &quot;There was clearly an emotional trauma created by this{firing} situation and it was very visible at the mediation,&quot;Mr. Slitt says. The mediator found a way to make theex-manager feel better, he adds.</TEXT></DOC>
