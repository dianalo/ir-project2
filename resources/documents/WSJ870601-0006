The plunge in the Commerce Department's composite index of leading economic indicators was the largest since a 0.8% drop in April 1985, but it largely reflected a decline in one component, the average workweek. The Labor Department took this measure of weekly hours during the week of Passover and Good Friday, however, so it probably overstates the workweek decline. Excluding the workweek report, the index would have fallen about 0.1%.    In addition, the big April drop in the index followed a revised 0.8% increase in March. The March rise was previously reported as 0.4%. The sharp revision occurred largely because the March increase in the inventories component was bigger than the Commerce Department originally thought.    &quot;If you take out the average workweek aberration, the index was essentially unchanged after being revised up in March,&quot; said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. &quot;All in all, it's no boom and no bust. The economy is just muddling along.&quot;    Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. in New York, said, &quot;The basic message is, the economy is very sluggishly going forward, but nothing drastic is happening.&quot;    Both economists said a drop in building permits in April suggests that home building is likely to be held down in coming weeks by the recent sharp rise in mortgage rates.    Economic growth is widely believed to be slowing markedly in the second quarter after expanding at a 4.4% inflation-adjusted annual rate in the first quarter. That rise in the gross national product, the nation's output of goods and services, is attributable almost entirely to strong inventory investment, which isn't likely to be repeated.    Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, said the report &quot;shows a weak economic picture across a broad range of indicators.&quot; He predicted that second-quarter growth is likely to be flat or slightly negative as a result of weak capital spending and sluggish inventory investment.    The April drop brought the index to 186.6% of its 1967 average from 187.7% in March.    The Department's index of coincident indicators, which tend to rise and fall with economic activity, fell 0.2% to 166.7% of its 1967 average after decreasing 0.2% in March to 167%.    The index of lagging indicators, which tend to trail economic trends, was unchanged in April after falling 0.5% in March to 131%. The ratio of coincident to lagging indicators, which some analysts believe signals turning points in the economy ahead of the leading index, was unchanged last month at 1.27.    Separately, the Commerce Department said it is considering changes in the index, which critics contend is no longer an accurate tool for projecting economic trends. The modifications could involve adding components or broadening the current ones.    Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner said, however, that proposals to alter the index haven't yet advanced beyond the staff level and that it's unlikely that any changes could get under way before the end of the year. Earlier this year, the department dropped one component -- net business formations -- after deciding it was unreliable. It had been designed to measure new business starts.    Here are the net contributions of the components of the Commerce Department's index of leading indicators.
