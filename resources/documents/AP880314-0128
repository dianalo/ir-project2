Strikes and disturbances broke out when some workers demandedcash instead of the bags of food the government today begandistributing to public employees until it has the money forsalaries.   For the first time, the disturbances reached into the centralbusiness district.   Police, armed with rubber truncheons and tear gas grenades,forcibly removed the teachers, who were blocking traffic in frontof the Ministry of Education. The teachers shouted, `We want outpay,'' ``Books yes, arms no,'' and ``Justice.''   The nation's military strongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,its new civilian chief executive, Manuel Solis Palma, and other topgovernment officials ended an emergency meeting at 2 a.m. today.There was no immediate comment on what action, if any, they took toovercome U.S. economic sanctions aimed at bringing down themilitary regime.   The government has said it does not have enough money to meetthis week's public payroll of $33 million for its 130,000 publicemployees.   Horacio Rodriguez, director of the Ministry of Farm and DairyProducts Marketing, said his agency had prepared 12,000 of the bagsof food for distribution this week.   They contained basic staples of the Panamanian diet such asrice, beans, flour, potatoes, fresh vegetables and beef.   The ``dignity bags'' were being sold by the government forbetween $15 and $16 each. It was believed that officials were notdemanding cash, and it was not clear how the workers were payingfor the supplies.   In another development, men in civilian clothes fired gunsoutside a church service in Panama City on Sunday and attacked a TVcameraman after roughing up a woman who was selling ananti-government newsletter. No one was injured.   The attack came at the Roman Catholic Church of Christ the King,long a center of government opposition activity, as its pastor, theRev. Xavier Villanueva, was beginning a late-morning Mass.   Solis Palma, installed by the ruling military last month asminister in charge of the presidency, has been meeting with hischief advisors almost constantly since last Thursday. Sunday'smeeting was the first time that Noriega had been known to join them.   Meanwhile, Noriega was said by a chief aide to be ``in excellentspirits, working very hard, always on the phone and maintaining hisdetermination not to surrender.''   Maj. Edgardo Lopez, the general's press officer, said Noriegawas telephoning other countries in search of financial assistanceand received ``some very positive answers from some friendlygovernments.''   Lopez declined to elaborate, but he added, ``this is a verycomplex situation that cannot be solved in 72 hours.''   Noriega is under indictment in the United States on federal drugtrafficking and money laundering charges.   Almost one in every five workers in this nation of 2.5 millionpeople is employed by the government. While Noriega's popularityhas fallen recently, he has so far enjoyed at least the outwardsupport of government employees.   In Washington, administration officials acknowledged Sunday thatthe economic sanctions imposed by President Reagan on Friday wereintended to make it harder for the Panamanian government to pay thepublic employees.   The timing of the sanctions ``was not a coincidence,'' said oneadministration source, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Reagan ordered the withholding of $6.5 million in monthly PanamaCanal fees due Panama this week and eliminated a trade preferencethe country has enjoyed under the Caribbean Basin Initiative.   Earlier, the United States suspended all economic and militaryaid to Panama and suppported legal efforts to freeze an estimated$50 million in official Panamanian funds held in American banks.   The legal action was taken by attorneys for Eric ArturoDelvalle, who was deposed as Panama's president on Feb. 26 in acoup engineered by Noriega. Although Delvalle has been in hidingever since, he still is recognized by the United States as Panama'slegitimate president.   The government ordered Panama's 118 local and foreign banksclosed temporarily on March 3, saying it could not provide themwith enough money to cover withdrawals. There was no word Sunday ofwhen the banks would reopen.   Their closure has left the country in economic chaos, withbusinessmen and individuals unable to cash checks and hoardingprecious dollars, which Panama uses as its currency.   In the attack outside the church on Sunday, an Associated Pressreporter and photographer said between 8 and 10 men dressed incivilian clothes fired handguns in the air and smashed the windowsof automobiles parked outside the Church of Christ the King.   No one was hurt in the shooting, but two of the gunmen struck anItalian television cameraman and stole his video camera as he wasfilming the incident. The men threw rocks at other reporters on thescene.</TEXT></DOC>
