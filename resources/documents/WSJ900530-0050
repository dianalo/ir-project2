CBS, the No. 3 network in prime time for three years,added 10 shows it hopes will attract the younger audiencethat advertisers seek -- and one that has eluded the networkfor decades. The CBS Inc. unit will try new lead-off shows inthe 8 p.m. slot on five nights of the week, trying to bolsterthe major weakness of its schedule.</LP><TEXT>   News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co., doing surprisingly wellwith only three nights a week of programming, is adding twomore nights and throwing its biggest hit -- the cartoonseries &quot;The Simpsons&quot; -- against one of the most potentcomedies in TV history, NBC's &quot;The Cosby Show.&quot;   A network rarely moves a new hit to a new night. Butpitting &quot;The Simpsons&quot; against &quot;Cosby&quot; underscores awidespread belief in the TV industry that NBC's Thursdaylineup is weakening -- and that Bill Cosby, in particular,might be vulnerable to spiky-haired Bart Simpson.   &quot;We're going after them,&quot; said Peter Chernin, Fox's topprogramming executive. Brandon Tartikoff, NBC Entertainmentpresident, said he welcomes the challenge.   CBS also senses weakness in NBC's Thursday lineup. It ismoving the CBS News series &quot;48 Hours&quot; from 8 p.m. Thurdays to10 p.m. Saturdays -- the lowest-viewing night of the week --to try &quot;The Flash,&quot; based on a comic book superhero. &quot;Oursnot to reason why, ours but to do or die,&quot; said Dan Rather,the CBS News anchorman who also hosts &quot;48 Hours.&quot;   Both CBS and Fox canceled a plethora of shows.   Of CBS's nine series introduced last fall, only one,&quot;Major Dad,&quot; is an outright survivor. CBS will have newlineups on five nights. CBS axed &quot;Tour of Duty,&quot; itstwo-year-old Vietnam war series. &quot;Wiseguy&quot; won't be on thefall schedule but will return later in the season -- withoutactor Ken Wahl. The fate of the western &quot;Paradise&quot; isuncertain.   CBS also will revamp &quot;Saturday Night with Connie Chung&quot;and move the reworked show, &quot;Face to Face with Connie Chung,&quot;to 10 p.m. Mondays. Jeff Sagansky, CBS Entertainmentpresident, said the show will be &quot;more celebrity driven&quot; thanthe Saturday series.   CBS also killed &quot;City,&quot; &quot;Sydney,&quot; &quot;Sugar and Spice,&quot;&quot;Loose Cannon,&quot; and &quot;Normal Life.&quot; &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; and&quot;Newhart&quot; also will disappear from the schedule followinglong runs.   The CBS schedule seems to shy away from the daringconcepts of some rivals.   Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s ABC has its oddball drama &quot;TwinPeaks&quot; and the musical, &quot;Cop Rock.&quot; NBC, a unit of GeneralElectric Co., has a comedy starring rapper Fresh Prince, aswell as a musical set in a high school.   CBS will stick with traditional TV comedies, trying five:&quot;Uncle Buck,&quot; based on a John Candy movie and seen as thebest newcomer on CBS; &quot;Lenny,&quot; a blue-collar guy with threekids; &quot;The Hammersmiths,&quot; a one-hour comedy about an extendedfamily; &quot;Evening Shade,&quot; with Burt Reynolds, and &quot;Four AlarmFamily,&quot; a single father rearing four sons.   One-hour dramas on CBS include &quot;WIOU,&quot; about a strugglingMidwest news station, and &quot;Over My Dead Body,&quot; with EdwardWoodward as a mystery writer akin to Angela Lansbury in CBS's&quot;Murder, She Wrote.&quot; &quot;The Green Machine&quot; is about anenvironmental A-Team.   At Fox, five current shows have been yanked: &quot;21 JumpStreet,&quot; its first breakthrough series; its spinoff,&quot;Booker&quot;; &quot;Alien Nation&quot;; &quot;Open House,&quot; and the much-toutedyoung-toughs series from Francis Ford Coppola, &quot;TheOutsiders.&quot; The demise of two others already had been set:&quot;It's Garry Shandling's Show&quot; and &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show.&quot;   Fox, now airing shows on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays,will add nine new programs as it expands to Thursdays andFridays. &quot;American Chronicles&quot; is from &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;co-creators David Lynch and Mark Frost and is a &quot;video novel&quot;about &quot;extraordinary people.&quot; The new comedies include&quot;Babes,&quot; about three sisters; &quot;True Colors,&quot; about aninterracial marriage; and &quot;Parker Lewis Can't Lose,&quot; about ahigh school student.   New dramas on Fox include &quot;D.E.A.,&quot; about drug agents,which will follow the manhunt show &quot;America's Most Wanted.&quot;&quot;Class of Beverly Hills&quot; is about a Midwest familytransplanted to the Los Angeles suburb, and &quot;Against theLaw,&quot; is about yet another cracker-jack attorney.</TEXT></DOC>
