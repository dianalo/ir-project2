This final rule changes that requirement by instructing exportersto obtain the Hong Kong Import Certificate instead of the Hong Kong ImportLicense. This rule also changes the name and address of the Hong Kong authoritiesresponsible for administering the Hong Kong Import Certificate/DeliveryVerification procedure. The Bureau of Export Administration has decided to make this change becausethe Hong Kong Import Certificate now complies with all the documentationelements considered essential by the Coordinating Committee on MultilateralControls (COCOM). Consistent with the grace period provided in andSection; 775.9(b)(2) of theEAR, applicants for export licenses to Hong Kong may continue to use theHong Kong Import License in support of their applications through July27, 1989. Applications received by the Office of Export Licensing afterthat date must be supported by a Hong Kong Import Certificate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule is effective June 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Willard Fisher, RegulationsBranch, Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone: (202) 377-3856.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements </ITAG>1. This rule complies with Executive Order 12291 and Executive Order 12661.2. This rule does not contain a collection of information subject to thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The Hong Kong Import Certificate is issued by the Governmentof Hong Kong. 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. 4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared. 5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA)(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)(5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruledoes not impose a new control. Further, no other law requires that a noticeof proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given forthis rule. Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is noformal comment period, public comments on this regulation are welcome ona continuing basis.
