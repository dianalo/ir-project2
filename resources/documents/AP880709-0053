(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two white men pleaded innocent tocharges that they helped batter down the door of a black family'shome, yelled racial slurs and hurled cinder blocks before they weredriven away at knifepoint.   The two _ Robert J. Waterhouse Jr., 27, and Robert A.Blanchette, 29 _ were arraigned Friday in Middlesex Superior Courton charges of assault and battery, malicious destruction of realproperty, threats, assault in a dwelling, and violation of civilrights.   Waterhouse and Blanchette, both of Burlington, were held on$300,000 double surety bonds, or $30,000 cash bail.   The two men were indicted last week in the June 19 attack on theBurlington family, along with two other white men from Burlingtonand a white woman from nearby Woburn. Both towns are suburbs ofBoston.   ``This is considered a serious serious matter and is beingprosecuted as a priority,'' said Tom Samoluk, a spokesman for thedistrict attorney's office. ``The DA is making it clear that itwill not be tolerated.''   Assistant District Attorney George Murphy said in court thatWaterhouse was the ``leader of the pack'' that battered down thedoor of Sherwin Moyston's home, entered yelling racial slurs andforced 32-year-old Moyston from the livingroom into the kitchen.   ``They came in yelling, `We want you, nigger! We want a piece ofyou, nigger!''' Murphy told Middlesex Superior Court Judge HillerZobel.   Moyston grabbed a knife in the kitchen and drove the attackersback out the front door, where he was joined by a relative, MarvinMcNichols.   Waterhouse struck McNichols in the mouth, knocking himunconscious and opening a wound that took 18 stitches to close,Murphy said.   The five attackers left the property after hurling cinder blocksat the house and breaking windows, authorities said.   ``When they were leaving, they said, `We're going to take careof you, niggers, we're going to come back,''' Murphy said.   The prosecutor had asked Zobel to hold Waterhouse on $500,000double surety and Blanchette on $200,000.   During the hearing, Murphy said he requested a higher bail forWaterhouse because of the suspect's record of violent behavior andbecause Waterhouse is currently the target of a grand jury probeinto the stabbing death of a black man whose body was found inWoburn last month. He refused to elaborate after the hearing.   The co-defendants, Barbara J. Lindsay and John C. Soda, both 18,and Mark Gilmartin, 20, are scheduled to be arraigned July 15.</TEXT></DOC>
