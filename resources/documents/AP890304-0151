The Greens, who have been trying to heal ideological rifts amongopposing factions, elected three new top leaders who represent abroad section of party interests.   The 39,000-member party sprang from radical environmentalist andleftist peace movements in the 1970s.   The last party leadership was dominated by radicals includingJutta Ditfurth, who stunned the party congress in Duisburg byannouncing before the vote she plans to quit the party. She bitterlydenounced moderates who want to put the Greens on a new politicalcourse.   Ms. Ditfurth charged the party was practicing ``policies ofexclusion against the left'' and was ``adapting a traditionalpolitical structure.''   The Greens' new leaders are Ruth Hammerbacher, from the party'smoderate ``realos'' (realists) faction; Verena Krieger, whorepresents interests further to the left; and Ralf Fuecks, whoseviews fall between those of his two colleagues. None of the formerleaders ran for re-election.   Ms. Ditfurth is head of the ``fundis'' (fundamentalists), who arelocked in a bitter ideological struggle with the ``realos.''   The dispute centers on the pragmatists' willingness to workwithin established political procedures and the fundamentalists'insistence that the party steer clear of wooing the mainstreamparties.   In her speech, Ms. Ditfurth said the party had been compromisingtoo many of its principles.   ``The goal of this is apparently the formation of a governmentwith the Social Democrats,'' Ms. Ditfurth said.   The Social Democrats are West Germany's main opposition party,and will be going up against Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ChristianDemocrats in next year's federal elections.   Polls indicate the Christian Democrats have lost support over thelast few months, opening the possibility the party might not be ableto put together a parliamentary majority after federal elections.   Ms. Ditfurth said she will probably leave the Greens followingthe 1990 elections.   She also denounced the Alternative List (AL), the Greens' WestBerlin sister party, for its plans to join a coalition government inthat city, saying it had abandoned principles it had shared with theGreens for years.   The Christian Democrats were ousted from power in West Berlinelections last month, and the victorious Social Democrats are nownegotiating with the Alternative List about forming a new government.</TEXT></DOC>
