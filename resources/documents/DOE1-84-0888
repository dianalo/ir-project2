It also needs rapidlychanging, weak magnetic field gradients along the x, y, and z axes; transmissionand reception of fields; and data processing equipment. The hardwarethat provides each of its needs can be considered as a set of separatesubsystems that are integrated into an MR imager; however, subsystemdesign can have significant impact on system performance. Although themagnet is the dominant component, it is not necessarily the one thatmost uniquely determines system performance. In the following sectionthe authors provide subsystem descriptions and consider how they interactwhen integrated into an imaging system.</TEXT></DOC>
