(letter to the editor)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Singleton, William; Glendinning, Kerry; Hill, Richard F.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>LetterandM;TOPS and multi-user 4DandM;may be a shaky comboandM;The article on data corruption with TOPS (&quot;Consultants grill TOPS on datacorruption,&quot; May 2) was incorrect when it stated that all known corruptionproblems involve Ethernet networks and/or large databases.andP;  TOPS will causeeven small databases to be damaged when running under AppleTalk withmulti-user 4th Dimension.andP;  Both companies' technical support peopleacknowledge the problems but say they do not know when a solution will beavailable.andM;Will Mayall of ACIUS says he is aware of two &quot;limitations&quot; that may causecorrupted data when working with TOPS:andM;* The server should not access a multi-user database when it is being used byremote stations, andandM;* The design mode shouldn't be entered at all with TOPS installed.andP;  The last&quot;limitation&quot; applies to single as well as multi-user mode.andP;  TOPS said almostthe same thing.andM;I have found, though, that when a remote station runs a 4D database inmulti-user mode without the server also running the database, the datathroughput slows to an intolerable rate.andP;  But even if that were not the case,the accepted limitations preclude the use of multi-user 4D with TOPS.andM;Iam very disappointed with MacWEEK for not dealing with this issue in theTOPS article.andP;  These are serious limitations with major software from majorcompanies, and no solutions are forth-coming in upcoming releases.andP;  I'd liketo see some pressure put on ACIUS and TOPS to resolve these problems, andMacWEEK can help in that effort.andP;  William Singleton Beverly Hills, Calif.andM;Reporters John Battelle and Jon Swartz respond: MacWEEK's article focused ondata corruption cases discussed at the Mac Consultants Network conference.andO;Statements were attributed to consultants who were at the conference or whowere contacted within that context.andP;  MacWEEK did not preclude the possibilityof other types of data corruption over TOPS networks.andM;Multitasking is needed toandM;make IPC really matterandM;Apple's announcement of forth-coming interprocess communication (IPC)guidelines has created an undue amount of excitement in the MAc world.andP;  ForApple developers to focus their concentration on IPC before first providingreal multitasking is out of line.andP;  Since task switching currently happensonly under user control, IPC cannot provide much interprogram integration.andM;Peter Lisker states in his column (&quot;How IPC could change the face ofnetworking,&quot; May 2) that IPC will go a long way toward true multitasking.andO;True multitasking in no way depends on IPC, but the usefulness of IPC dependsentirely on multitasking.andM;Once Apple provides a true multitasking Finder, adding IPC will be a smallfeat.andP;  In fact, the best standard to which Apple could adhere is alreadywell-defined and is used by a wide variety of programs.andP;  AppleTalk and theName Binding Protocol contain all the necessary components of an IPCprotocol.andP;  If AppleTalk were extended to allow a packet to originate andarrive on the same Mac, IPC would be inherently possible.andM;Using existing AppleTalk methods would alleviate the need for yet another newstandard and new drivers.andP;  A single interface to AppleTalk would suffice fora program to communicate with other Macs or other programs on the same Mac.andO;Also, programs that already support AppleTalk communications would implicitlybe IPC-compatible.andM;I am a strong advocate of IPC and of maintaining high standards, but thereseems to be no need for another new standard.andP;  The real need is formultitasking under the Finder.andP;  Kerry Clendinning network software engineerSouthwest Network Services Austin, TexasandM;Richard Hill sole distributorandM;of RMS Management PlusandM;My company is the sole distributor of a Macintosh software product known asthe RMS Plus Restaurant Management System.andP;  The copyright and trademark forRMS Plus is owned by Richard F.
