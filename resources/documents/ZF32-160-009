(Management).andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Laura BrennanandM;Compaq Computer Corp. has lost its Midas touch.andM;The 9-year-old Houston company, in a midlife crisis, is being squeezed bycloners swarming over its traditional market and by workstation vendorsmoving onto its turf.andP;  Its future hinges on Systempro and RISC products, andits success in Europe -- where it generates 60 percent of its revenues -- isimperiled by a strengthening dollar.andP;  Wall Street is not happy.andM;Compaq is looking at its first down year in company history, said RickMartin, an analyst at stock brokerage Prudential-Bache Securities in NewYork, who recommends that Compaq shareholders sell their stock.andM;The company's March quarter per-share earnings of $1.26 disappointed Martin,who had estimated a return of $1.40.andP;  He now believes Compaq's crisis willextend through the year, ending in lower returns per share than in 1990.andM;Can Compaq prove the skeptics wrong?andP;  It may be months before a new strategypays off.andP;  Following recent price cuts, telephone support initiatives andadvanced dealer certification, Compaq's toughest job now is to stop clonerencroachment.andM;Though Compaq's sales and profits far surpass those of PC compatibles makersDell Computer Corp., AST Research Inc. and Advanced Logic Research Inc.andO;(ALR), all three companies are growing faster both domestically andinternationally (see chart).andM;&quot;They're not flies, they're predators,&quot; Compaq CEO Rod Canion said of thegroup.andP;  None of the cloners is prey, however, to the currency fears ofCompaq.andM;In its March quarter, Compaq grew by just 16 percent in Europe, vs.andP;  40percent to 50 percent throughout last year.andP;  After adjusting for currencychanges, real growth was only 6 percent, vs.andP;  20 percent to 25 percent realgrowth in the December quarter.andM;&quot;The companies that are growing aren't complaining about currency,&quot; saidAndrew Kessler, vice president at Morgan Stanley Co., an investment firm inNew York.andM;What's more, the cloners have taken a page from Compaq's book.andP;  ALR and ASTraced to market this month with new machines based on Intel Corp.'s 486SXchip, while Dell demonstrated a model that officials said may be ready byJune.andM;Compaq, which built its reputation on being first to market, has bided itstime with the 486SX like a brooding elder.andM;&quot;The processor game is really cut and dried,&quot; Canion said.andP;  &quot;Customers arenot crying out for new technology, but how to make it play together.&quot; That'snot to say Compaq won't release a 486SX product; Canion said he hopes tointroduce one soon.andM;Despite the actions that Compaq has taken over recent months, many analystssay its PC reign is waning.andP;  A recent lawsuit against Dell highlights itsfrustration with former market also-rans that now pose serious threats.andM;&quot;The mainstream PC market that has been its mother lode has played itself outin advantages for Compaq.andP;  It's a fact of life that over time many vendorshave caught up with them,&quot; said Peter Tiege, analyst at InfoCorp, a SantaClara, Calif., research group.andM;As a result, Compaq is looking to ply its step-ahead philosophy to marketsthat the cloners aren't yet in.andP;  With the Extended Industry StandardArchitecture consortium under its belt, Compaq is now taking the AdvancedComputing Environment initiative to a new platform based on MIPS ComputerSystems Inc.'s RISC chips.andM;But nowhere is Compaq more in transition than at the high end of its line.andO;The company must weave in RISC machines without cannibalizing sales of theSystempro, which brought in $240 million last year.andP;  Compaq is still buildingits Systempro infrastructure, and designating dealers equipped to handle themachine.andM;So focused is Compaq on its high-end strategy that this will be its firstyear to miss Comdex/Fall.andM;The company is not seeking to add more PC dealers to its roster of about3,400 worldwide, said Doug Johns, vice president of corporate marketing.andO;Instead, Compaq is funding new technologies.andM;Last month, it poured $135 million into graphics workstation vendor SiliconGraphics Inc. (SGI) in preparation for the MIPS-based product line.andO;Currently, 100 percent of Compaq's Randamp;D funds are focused on Intel systems,Canion said, with the majority of RISC development being borne by SGI.andM;That division of labor will change over the next year, as Compaq gets closerto launching its RISC machines.andP;  Until then, however, the once-hot upstart--the IBM alternative with breakthrough technology -- has its hands full.andM;--------------------Additional reporting by Vance McCarthy</TEXT></DOC>
