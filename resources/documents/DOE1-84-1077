<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-84-1077 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the last several months, there have been a number of exciting theoreticaldevelopments in the area of superstring compactification. New compactificationshave been found, as well as new string theories. Effects have been discoveredthat lift some vacuum degeneracies, and substantial progress has beenmade toward understanding higher order corrections to the classical stringequations; just to mention a few. The authors are still very from beingable to make any experimental predictions, but their understanding israpidly advancing. A status report of the field would surely be outdatedby the time these proceedings appear. The author therefore limits hiswritten remarks to a discussion of some qualitative features of superstringcompactification which he suspects will have some relevance to any compactificationof any string theory. In particular, he discusses the fascinating waytechnology enters the picture.</TEXT></DOC>
