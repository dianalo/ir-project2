Hiroshi Tanaka, a Canon senior managing director, said ata news conference yesterday that the company would introducethe screen in a computer next spring and boasted that itcould take up to half the Japanese market fordesktop-computer displays in the next five years. He alsoasserted that over the next decade the screen would prove thenecessary breakthrough for full-sized flat-screentelevisions.</LP><TEXT>   Many analysts and competitors dismissed Canon's claims ashyperbole. But some industry officials were enthusiastic.&quot;This will make flat-panel display technology a reality onyour desk, with no limits on size or resolution,&quot; said SusumuFurukawa, president of Microsoft Corp.'s Japanese unit.   Analysts say it's too soon to know if Canon really hasmade a significant breakthrough with its announcement that itwould use an untested technology called &quot;ferroelectronics&quot; tomake the screens. But the development reflects volatility inthe field as well as Canon's continuing efforts to expandbeyond copiers, facsimile machines and computer printers intoother computer-related businesses.   A small club of Japanese companies led by Sharp Corp.,Toshiba Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and NEC Corp. is thought to havea tremendous edge in the emerging flat-screen industry afterpouring billions of yen into development and production. Flatscreens are likely to take an increasing share of the marketfor television and computer displays, and U.S. governmentofficials have grown worried about Japan's dominance in thefield. This past summer, the U.S imposed stiff tariffs on theimport of certain liquid-crystal displays, or LCDs, fromJapan after accusing the companies of dumping.   But those Japanese companies are having difficultyproducing the screens, particularly in sizes large enough fordesktop computers and televisions: Some industry sources sayup to 95% of the displays made are defective. Canon, incontrast, says only 30% of its screens are flawed.   Canon, like the other screen manufacturers, is relying onbasic licenses acquired from U.S. and European inventors. Mr.Tanaka said the company would be seeking foreign partners tohelp spread the new technology and would even considermanufacturing overseas within three years. The currentJapanese leaders in flat screens have so far refused to buildplants outside Japan.   Canon is the first major manufacturer to announce aproduct in the field of ferroelectronics, although others areclosely watching it. A small group of devotees say theprocess could ultimately replace most of today'ssemiconductors and computer disks, as well as the screens.   A ferroelectronic device is similar to a conventionalsemiconductor: It stores information electronically. But mostconventional semiconductors require a constant supply ofenergy to retain the data; if the battery dies, theinformation soon disappears. In ferroelectronic material, theinformation stays put unless another electric charge changesit; it is good for up to 10 years without any power. (Thename ferroelectronics comes from early mistaken theories thatthe technology was related to iron, or ferrous compounds.)   Most Japanese companies favor making flat screens using asemiconductor-type approach. The so-called thin-filmtransistor, or TFT, screen, has hundreds of transistorsrequiring constant recharging to show a picture. But oneflawed transistor ruins the whole screen, and makers arehaving trouble making perfect products.   The ferroelectronic screen doesn't require the largenumber of transistors and is thus considered easier to make.Instead, the major manufacturing challenge is making a screenwith two layers evenly spaced about 1/10,000 of an inchapart. Canon says it can meet that challenge.   Mr. Tanaka said that for the next couple of years Canonwould focus on relatively large screens for desktop computersand wouldn't directly compete with the Japanese companiesmaking TFT screens for laptop and notebook-sized PCs. But hesaid Canon would later attack that market.   Canon will first sell the screens in Japan in a PC systemdesigned for desktop publishing. The first screens will beblack and white; the company said it would sell full-colorscreens within a year. Canon wouldn't disclose the price ofthe machines.</TEXT></DOC>
