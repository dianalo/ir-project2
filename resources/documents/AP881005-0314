Vons Cos. revealed it had given its suppliers 45 days noticethat they must either certify their products as free of dangerouschemicals or label the products in keeping with California'sProposition 65.   Vons, which has 345 supermarkets in Southern California, pulledpipe tobacco and cigars from its shelves this week because theydon't carry health warnings, as do packages of cigarettes andchewing tobacco.   Proposition 65, an initiative approved by California voters in1986, requires warning notices in stores, the workplace, and otherareas where people might be exposed any of 242 substances _including tobacco _ on a state list of chemicals known to causecancer or birth defects.   Vons notified 2,000 manufacturers, suppliers and brokers theymust either certify their products as free of chemicals on the listor label the products, spokeswoman Vickie Sanders said Wednesday.That notice, in letters mailed Sept. 21, gives the suppliers 45days to comply, she said.   While the letter doesn't specifically threaten to removeunlabeled products from the shelves, the tobacco action underlinesthe chain's emphasis on labels.   Safeway Stores Inc., Lucky Stores Inc. and Alpha Beta Co. havemailed similar notices, spokesmen for the grocers said, althoughAlpha Beta's letters don't specifically threaten to pull unlabeledtobacco from the shelves.   One of the authors of the toxins initiative hailed Vons' move asthe start of a wide trend toward product labeling. But the author,David Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund, contended the ElMonte-based grocery chain did so only under threat of a lawsuit.   ``What you see Vons doing is enforcing the law against themanufacturers,'' Roe said from the fund's Oakland office. ``They'resaying, `Don't stick us with the warning.'''   Previously, he said, California markets had resisted labelingand contended that an industry-funded, toll-free telephoneinformation number on chemicals in food constituted sufficientwarning to consumers under Proposition 65.   Two tobacco lobbying groups, the Cigar Association of Americaand the Pipe Tobacco Council, contended the industry has met thelaw's requirements by sending stores warning signs that can beposted on shelves. Distribution of those signs and a program ofperiodic media advertisements on the hazards of cigars and pipetobacco began in February, said Norman Sharp, who is president ofboth Washington, D.C.-based groups.   The antitoxins law sets penalties of $2,500 per violation perday for failure to post warnings of hazardous chemicals. Ratherthan designating a state agency as enforcer, the measure allowscitizens or the state attorney general to sue businesses whichdon't comply.   The grocers' notices to their suppliers all followed anannouncement Aug. 2 by several environmental groups that they wereprepared to sue seven supermarket chains and a drugstore chain overtobacco labeling. On Friday, state Attorney General John Van deKamp took up the case from the environmental groups and filed suitin state court against Vons, Lucky, Alpha Beta, Safeway, Ralph's,Raley's, Albertson's and Thrifty Drugs.</TEXT></DOC>
