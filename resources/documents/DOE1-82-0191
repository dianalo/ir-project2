Data on the observedconcentrations of 320 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were compiled,critically evaluated, and assembled into a relational data base. Ambient(outdoor) measurements, indoor data, and data collected with personalmonitors are included. The data are primarily from the period 1970-1987and for locations within the United States. In order to compile datafrom many different sources, each concentration record in the data baserepresents the daily average for a single chemical, wherever feasible.The total data base contains more than 175,000 concentration records.The data have been assembled into a relational data base using dBASEIII Plus, a commercially available data base management program. Thedata base is available on IBM PC-compatible diskettes. The availablereport contains a complete description of the data base files and a guidedescribing the use of a prepared program for searching and maintainingthe data base. The data base consists of 42 files and requires 19.4 Megabytesof storage space.</TEXT></DOC>
