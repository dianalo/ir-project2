The study, released early this month, was jointlysponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission and resulted from a charge to the National Research Council'sCommittee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiations (BEIR). Inits study, the committee focused on alpha-emitting radionuclides knownto induce health effects in exposed human populations. Although the studydeals also with other alpha emitters - polonium, radium, thorium, uranium,and transuranic elements - the committee paid particular attention toradon and its decay products because of concern over lung cancer riskassociated with increased indoor concentrations of radon in homes.</TEXT></DOC>
