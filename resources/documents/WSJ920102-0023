Fed by corporate America's capital-raising drive, totalvolume of new U.S. stock and bond issues hit a staggering$587.44 billion, nearly double the previous record of $313.77billion in 1990, calculates Securities Data Co. &quot;Every sectorof the market broke or flirted with new records,&quot; the datacompany says.</LP><TEXT>   But it will take some effort -- and a cooperative economy-- for securities firms to sustain their torrid underwritingpace on behalf of U.S. corporations in the coming year, sayWall Street underwriting executives.   &quot;My 11-year-old would have done fine, too,&quot; last year,says Robert G. Scott, a managing director at Morgan StanleyGroup Inc. in charge of capital markets. But with theprospect of choppy markets and an uncertain economicscenario, &quot;1992 is going to tell us a lot more about who'sgood in this business and who isn't,&quot; he says.   For example, a sharp upward turn in interest rates or aplunge in stock prices could bring Wall Street's underwritingmachine to a halt, say Wall Street underwriters.   But that machine was working overtime in 1991.Corporations issued a record $56 billion of common stock --half of that in the form of initial public offerings,including closed-end funds -- and a record $200.45 billion inbonds. There was a tripling of preferred-stock financings.And the mortgage-backed and asset-backed debt marketscontinued to grow.   In the end, U.S. corporations had issued more stock thanthey retired for the first time in eight years. This attemptto replenish equity capital (after many companies had piledon debt throughout the 1980s, partly through leveragedbuy-outs) was hailed by regulators. Richard Breeden, chairmanof the Securities and Exchange Commission, cited what hehoped would be the &quot;commencement of a long-term shift in thecapital-raising mix of American corporations.&quot;   Half of the 10 largest equity-related deals done in thepast 10 years were completed in 1991, includingmultibillion-dollar offerings for RJR Nabisco Inc., TimeWarner Inc. and Ford Motor Co. The year was a &quot;trend-breaker&quot;because corporate America added to equity capital, saysVikram S. Pandit, a Morgan Stanley managing director incharge of equity capital markets. He adds: &quot;There's adeleveraging aspect that will continue.&quot;   The record amounts of underwriting activity pushed up thefees that securities firms get from bringing out stocks andbonds, with the biggest chunks going to Merrill ($833.5million), Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. ($686.9 million) and MorganStanley Group Inc. ($480 million). The fee intake helped WallStreet post blockbuster profits in 1991, in contrast to someof the Street's worst-ever results in 1990.   &quot;It's one of those years where everything was working,&quot;says Thomas W. Davis, head of equity transactions at MerrillLynch.   Merrill Lynch's first-place finish among the Wall Streetunderwriters was its fourth in a row. The nation's biggestbrokerage firm raised a record $100.72 billion in U.S.issues, for a 17.1% market share. Second-place Goldman wasable to take in nearly as much in fees as Merrill because itdominated the area of stock underwriting, a far morelucrative business than bonds.   As 1992 begins, there are plenty of indications thatunderwriting activity will remain strong: low interest rates;relatively attractive stock prices; and the clear need fordebt-laden corporations to raise equity.   One sobering sign for underwriters entering 1992 is thatunderwriting activity already had slowed down late in theyear; among other factors, the stock market's 120-pointplunge on Nov. 15 scared away some corporations that wereready to issue shares. &quot;That 120-point crack back in Novembersort of made people sit up and notice that trees don't growto the sky,&quot; says T. Anthony Brooks, head of stocksyndication at the Lehman Brothers division of ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc.   Nevertheless, Mr. Brooks predicts that the pace of stockunderwriting this year will pick back up and could run&quot;relatively near&quot; 1990 levels.   Salomon Brothers, battered by its Treasury-auctionscandal, had the biggest decline in underwriting position,sliding to No. 7 from No. 4 the year earlier as some of itsbond-underwriting business went elsewhere. The Salomon Inc.unit's overall market share dropped to 7.9% from 10.4%.Salomon Brothers dropped in the rankings &quot;while experiencinga continual slide in financings since the second quarter&quot; of1991, notes IDD Information Services Inc. Salomon Brothersdeclined to comment.   The biggest overall underwriting improvement in 1991 wasmade by the Lehman Brothers division of Shearson, whichpicked up some of Salomon's lost business to jump to No. 3from No. 8, boosting market share to 11.7% from 6.3%. Thegains have been a morale-booster for Shearson, a unit ofAmerican Express Co., which has been trying to emphasize itsLehman Brothers heritage.   But one drawback for Lehman Brothers is that the divisionmade its gains through a surge in bond underwriting, not themore-lucrative area of stocks. Indeed, Lehman Brothers'common-stock ranking fell two notches to No. 6. LehmanBrothers executives vow to combat that stock slippage.   &quot;I properly should not give an answer&quot; for the division'slackluster stock performance in 1991, says Mr. Brooks, aformer CS First Boston Inc. executive who joined LehmanBrothers around Thanksgiving. But he adds: &quot;I can tell youthere is a very significant commitment to the equity marketand the equity function&quot; at Lehman Brothers for 1992. He sayshis firm has 15 stock issues in the pipeline, valued atroughly $2.5 billion.   The continued growth of the mortgage-backed andasset-backed markets has sparked some controversy. Inparticular, the soaring volume in the mortgage-backed market,which boosted the rankings of firms such as General ElectricCo.'s Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. unit, has spurred complaints fromrivals that the market shouldn't even be included because ittypically doesn't raise capital for corporations. Kidderfinished No. 5 in the overall rankings almost solely becauseof its $43.37 billion in mortgage-backed underwritings (a17.4% market share). Lehman Brothers also helped its overallranking through a big boost in mortgage-backed activity.   In contrast, the three major firms that slipped in theoverall rankings in 1991 -- CS First Boston's First BostonCorp., Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers -- all did lessthan half the amount of mortgage-backed activity generated byKidder. Not surprisingly, bankers at these firms grouse aboutthe methods used in the underwriting tables.   One of the year's biggest growth areas, notes IDDInformation Services, was preferred stock, a securityclassified as a stock but that pays fixed dividends like abond. With the huge preferred issues sold by Ford Motor andGeneral Motors Corp., &quot;the preferred market opened up forindustrial companies&quot; to complement the traditionalpreferred-stock issuance by banks and closed-end funds, saysRoger M. Vasey, executive vice president and head of debtmarkets at Merrill Lynch.   Morgan Stanley's hot product, PERCs (preferred equityredemption cumulative stock), accounted for a quarter of allpreferred-stock volume, says IDD. These included the GM deal,as well as those for Kmart, Texas Instruments Inc., RJRNabisco, Aon Corp. and Tenneco Inc.   But is the preferred-stock boom running out of gas?Perhaps.   &quot;I think the big question is: How deep is the market forthe product?&quot; says John Griff, a Lehman Brothers executivevice president and bond syndicate manager. Wall Street &quot;soldan awful lot of preferred stock in '91,&quot; he notes, suggestingthat future demand will be limited.   Despite its PERCs success, Morgan Stanley slipped a notchin the rankings. Morgan Stanley bankers insist they're notbothered by the drop, because it reflects the heavymortgage-backed underwriting of other firms. &quot;We view it as arecord year; we don't view it as a slip,&quot; says Mark A.Seigal, a Morgan Stanley managing director. He adds: &quot;We wantto do quality business, not quantity.&quot;   Overall, executives on both the stock and bond sides ofWall Street say there's still plenty of demand for new issuesin 1992, whether interest rates continue to fall or not.   While things are lethargic for stock issuance at themoment, many underwriters expect the lethargy to lift by lateJanuary or early February (partly as some deals that wereshelved after the Nov. 15 stock market plunge getresuscitated). Meanwhile, bond underwriters point to thelarge amount of debt maturing in 1992 that could need to berefinanced with new bonds. &quot;There's $72 billion of debtthat's callable and/or refundable in '92 versus $48 billionin '91,&quot; says Merrill's Mr. Vasey. &quot;That's a large potentialsource of corporate funding.&quot;   In fact, Lehman's Mr. Griff even anticipates that bondunderwriters could be swamped with six months of financingactivity in just the first two months of 1992, assuminginterest rates stay stable or move slightly lower. &quot;We're notplanning any vacations,&quot; he vows.   ---         The Biggest Corporate Financings of 1991                                                                                                          DEBT                                                                                                                                                         AMOUNT                                                  RAISED   ISSUER                         DATE      (In millions)                                                                                                          RJR Nabisco Holdings           April 18      $1,500.0   Republic Nat.
