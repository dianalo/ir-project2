The spending cuts, called for in the recent Congress-White House budget talks, will result in troop reductions and cancellation of some weapons programs, said William Taft IV, deputy defense secretary. &quot;I don't think you can take 10% to 12% out of the program and not reduce force structure,&quot; he said in a talk with reporters.    The reduction would shrink the planned level of authorized spending from $332 billion to $299 billion for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. However, Mr. Taft said the military services are only beginning to decide which programs will be sacrificed.    For the moment, the plan is that the different services would bear a roughly equal burden of the $33 billion. &quot;Each of the services will be recommending terminations of a number of programs,&quot; he said.    According to Robert Helm, the Pentagon's comptroller, the current budget-reduction process represents a &quot;sea change&quot; in how the Defense Department has managed cuts that were imposed in its ambitious spending plans.    Usually, the Defense Department has tried to absorb spending cuts by stretching out hundreds of weapons projects, and by trimming flying hours and steaming times. But, worried that this approach would eventually render a &quot;hollow army,&quot; Mr. Taft said, the services have been asked to shrink actual forces. &quot;When you're looking at a five-year drought, as opposed to a one-year freeze,&quot; he added, such an approach is &quot;logical.&quot;    It is estimated that as a result of the new spending plan, the number of active U.S. military forces will decline 100,000 by 1994, from 2.1 million currently. Mr. Taft said the Army &quot;is reluctant&quot; to accept troop reductions because its active force levels have remained flat for most of the 1980s. But Mr. Taft said the Army may be forced to make cuts anyway.    The magnitude of the budget reductions underscores how far out of line the Pentagon's earlier spending plan had become. Although the military buildup came to a screeching halt three years ago, the Pentagon staunchly held to plans for increases that few considered realistic.    Even after the sharp reductions, Pentagon authorized spending would grow at an annual rate of about 2% after inflation, beginning in fiscal 1989. For fiscal 1988 and the two previous fiscal years, the defense budget shrunk slightly, once inflation is taken into account.    Moreover, spending on some programs likely will increase. The Strategic Defense Initiative, the Trident submarine and missile program, and the MX missile are all likely to grow, albeit at slower rates than planned, Defense Department officials said.    One new program that may be canceled is the $50 billion Midgetman nuclear missile. Some military officials contend that the weapon duplicates the MX. Both are land-based nuclear missiles, and under the Pentagon's latest plan to base the MX missile on rail cars, both would be mobile systems. The Midgetman has many defenders in the Congress, though.    All the military services are poised to embark on costly new weapons projects in the next five years, but some may be postponed. The Navy wants to build a new submarine, the SSN-21 Seawolf; the Army plans an advanced helicopter, the LHX; and the Air Force envisions a new advanced tactical fighter jet and a new &quot;Stealth&quot; strategic bomber. Each of these programs is expected to cost more than $35 billion if completed. </TEXT></DOC>
