The Pentagon has ``stringent and necessary safety precautions''for its chemical weapons program, said Thomas J. Welch, deputyassistant secretary of defense for chemical weapons.   Welch defended the Pentagon's safety standards in an appearancebefore the Senate Governmental Affairs oversight subcommittee,which has been investigating the safety of the two programs.   A subcommittee staff report earlier this year found that thePentagon lacked firm safety regulations for research intobiological weapons and outlined safety lapses in both chemical andbiological programs.   The Pentagon last year began building chemical weapons for thefirst time since 1969 and research is conducted at government andprivate laboratories in about 150 locations throughout the country,according to the subcommittee.   The United States has formally renounced the use of biologicalwarfare since 1969, but the Pentagon spends an increasing amount ofmoney to develop defenses for a variety of types of germ warfarethat might be used against U.S. forces.   Spending for biological and chemical research has increasedsharply since President Reagan took office in 1981. In fiscal 1980,the total research was $63.5 million, compared with the $348million figure for fiscal 1986.   The General Accounting Office, in a report presented to thecommittee, said there are a number of potential dangers among thechemical and biological research sites scattered around the UnitedStates.   Dr. Neil H. Levitt, a former microbologist at Fort Detrick, Md.,told the panel that in 1981 the Army lost about two quarts of apotentially dangerous virus used as a vaccine against a highlyinfectious disease and has not been able to account satisfactorilyfor the missing virus since then.   Military officials dispute Dr. Levitt's contentions and said thevirus vaccine had been sterilized by a technician.   Welch said the Pentagon, in its chemical weapons program,``applies stringent safety, storage, maintenance, use andaccounting requirements for all internal and contractor facilitiesthat use chemical agents.''   Those requirements included unannounced inspections andrehearsals for hypothetical accidents, he said.   In Geneva, Switzerland, on Thursday, Max Friedersdorf, the U.S.delegate to the Conference on Disarmament, named officially for thefirst time the location of five chemical weapons productionfacilities in the United States.   They are located at: the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, in Colorado;the Pine Bluff Arsenal in Arkansas; Muscle Shoals in Alabama;Newport Army Ammunition Depot in Indiana; and Aberdeen ProvingGround in Maryland.   However, an Army spokesman in Washington, Lt. Col. John Chapla,said chemical weapons currently are only produced or stored at PineBluff and Muscle Shoals.   ``These are locations which are at present or were at one timeinvolved in the production of chemical weapons,'' Chapla said ofthe five sites named by Friedersdorf. At Rocky Mountain andNewport, there is no chemical weapon production, testing or storagegoing on.''   Aberdeen is used to test some components of the currentgeneration of chemical weapons, but is not used to produce, storeor test the binary, or dual chemical weapons that the U.S. militarynow uses, Chapla said.   ``Our focus now is the production of binary chemical,principally at Pine Bluffs,'' Chapla said.   Some work is also done at Muscle Shoals on one of the chemicalsused in the production of binary weapons, but the weapon is notdeadly until the two chemicals are combined, he said.   ``The binary program is such that you never have a completeweapon stored in any one place. The two chemicals are never kepttogether and they will not be mated until just before firing,''Chapla said.   As for biological weapons, the Pentagon has proposed building a$5.4 million biological aerosol test facility at the Dugway ProvingGround in Utah.   At Thursday's hearing, Welch said that in response to thesubcommittee's report last May, the Pentagon will require that itsbiological research program comply with biosafety standards set bythe federal Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutesof Health. Previously, that compliance was only a recommendation,not a requirement.   The GAO noted that in addition to Pentagon requirements, theprograms also must meet local and state safety standards.   The Defense Department approaches safety for the programs in twodifferent ways, the study said.   For private companies doing research into chemical weapons, thePentagon has ``developed and implemented a reasonably systemic andcomprehensive approach for evaluating and managing risks,'' the GAOsaid. But it recommended that the Pentagon work harder at lookingat potential accidents.   No Pentagon safety requirements have been done for biologicalweapons research, the GAO said. Instead, the Pentagon ``relies onan existing safeguards system that was developed by thebiomedical'' establishment.   ``Biological defense research and development poses recognizedhealth and safety risks, thus adequate protective measures need tobe implemented,'' the GAO warned.   The review noted that about ``10 percent of the biologicaldefense program contracts involve genetic engineering techniques tostudy disease processes. The use of genetic engineering andrecombinant DNA molecules has been a subject of concern because ofthe risks associated with the possible creation of modified agentsand their potential release into the environment.''   For that reason, the GAO noted, the Pentagon requires thecontractors to follow NIH guidelines for research involving geneticengineering.</TEXT></DOC>
