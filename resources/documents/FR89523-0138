Introduction</ITAG>With the passage of the 1988 amendments to the Juvenile Justice and DelinquencyPrevention Act, the Congress mandated in section 248(b)(1) that OJJDP conducta study to determine:(A) How juveniles who are American Indians and Alaskan Natives and whoare accused of committing offenses on and near Indian reservations andAlaskan Native villages, respectively, are treated under the systems ofjustice administered by Indian tribes and Alaskan Native organizations,respectively, that perform law enforcement functions;(B) The amount of financial resources (including financial assistance providedby governmental entities) available to Indian tribes and Alaskan Nativeorganizations that perform law enforcement functions, to support community-basedalternatives to incarcerating juveniles; and(C) The extent to which such tribes and organizations comply with the requirementsspecified in paragraphs 12(A), (13) and (14) of section 223(a), applicableto the detention and confinement of juveniles.The provisions of section 223(a) as cited in (C) above refer to the mandatesof the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act with which a statemust comply in order to receive formula grant funds allocated under PartB of the Act. The mandates are:<ITAG tagnum="21">(12)(A) Provide within three years after submission of the initialplan that juveniles who are charged with or who have committed offensesthat would not be criminal if committed by an adult or offenses which donot constitute violations of valid court orders, or such nonoffenders asdependent or neglected children, shall not be placed in secure detentionfacilities or secure correctional facilities. (Future references to thisprovision will be termed ``deinstitutionalization of status offenders''or ``DSO.'')</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(13) Provide that juveniles alleged to be or found to be delinquentand youths within the purview of paragraph (12) shall not be detained orconfined in any institution in which they have regular contact with adultpersons incarcerated because they have been convicted of a crime or areawaiting trial on criminal charges. (Future references to this provisionwill be termed ``separation from adults.'')</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(14) Provide that, beginning after the five-year period followingDecember 8, 1980, no juvenile shall be detained or confined in any jailor lockup for adults, except that the OJJDP Administrator shall, through1993, promulgate regulations which make exceptions with regard to the detentionof juveniles accused of nonstatus offenses who are awaiting an initialcourt appearance pursuant to an enforceable State law requiring such appearanceswithin twenty-four hours after being taken into custody (excluding weekendsand holidays) provided that such exceptions are limited to areas which_(A)are outside of the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, (B) have noexisting acceptable alternative placement available, and (C) are in compliancewith the provisions of paragraph (13) regarding separation from adults.(Future references to this provision will be termed ``jail removal.'')</ITAG>The Provisions of section 248(b)(2) (A) and (B) of the Juvenile Justiceand Delinquency Prevention Act stipulate that Federal funding to supportthis study (i.e., the Indian juvenile justice systems research mandatedunder 248(b)(1)) is deemed to be for the benefit of Indians, and thus,is subject to section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and EducationAssistance Act. Therefore, applicants for this study must, to the greatestextent feasible, provide preferences and opportunities to Indians for trainingand employment in connection with the administration of this cooperativeagreement; and provide preference in the award of contracts/grants underthe cooperative agreement to Indian organizations and to Indian-owned economicenterprises, as defined in section 1452 of the Indian Self-Determinationand Education Assistance Act. References to Indians and Indian organizationsshall be deemed to include Alaskan Natives and Alaskan Native organizations,respectively.This study entitled ``American Indian and Alaskan Native Youth: Study ofTribal and Alaskan Native Justice Systems'' is designed to respond fullyto the Congressional research mandate, and to inform the development ofimproved program strategies for juvenile justice and delinquency preventionamong Indian youth.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>Relatively little research has been conducted on juvenile justice and delinquencyprevention practices among the Indian nations. Available data sets on Indianarrests frequently do not distinguish between juveniles and adults. Analysesof these data sets suggest that the arrest rates for crimes committed byIndians on or near certain reservations are comparable to those of personsliving in high crime, inner city neighborhoods. It should be noted, however,that there is substantial variance in arrest rates across different tribesand reservations.Local, state, and national level statistics do not provide accurate estimatesof Indian youth justice system processing for those offenses committedon or near the reservations. This is due in part to the lack of specificationof Indian status of the youth, and the exclusion of cases handled on reservationsby the tribal justice systems. In a report entitled, <T3>Children in Federal Custody: Assessment of Federal Policy and Practices,</T3>the researchers noted the inadequacy of recordkeeping on: the processingof juveniles through the tribal justice systems, the volume of varioustypes of juvenile crime on the reservation, the age or background of thechild most likely to have involvement with the juvenile justice system,and the length and location of confinement.Indian reservation youth appear to fall under the purview of more variedcombinations of tribal, local, state, and Federal justice jurisdictionsthan any other category of American youth. The evolution of justice systemjurisdictions for tribal youth has been a very lengthy and extremely complexprocess. Indian criminal law has not historically recognized a distinctionbetween adult and juvenile offenders. Furthermore, tribal courts have beenrestricted in the handling of major crimes committed on reservations, offensescommitted by non-Indians, and offenses involving non-Indian victims.The Federal Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Preventionimplemented a mandated three phase study in 1982 to gather informationon the placement and detention of Indian youth. One publication producedunder this study was <T3>Children in Federal Custody: Native American Youth Study, Phase II.</T3>This report examined tribal handling of juvenile offenders, the fragmentationof resources, the concurrent jurisdictions, and the inadequacy of availablefacilities and services. A methodological limitation of this study wasthe fact only 41 percent of the 128 tribes contacted completed a mailedquestionnaire. Interviews conducted at 48 courts (14 Code of Federal Regulationscourts, 33 tribal courts, and one court under state jurisdiction) resultedin far superior participation rates, however, the field researchers didreport difficulty in locating the necessary statistics and information.Based on previous research, it appears that many tribal justice systemsare ill-equipped to achieve deinstitutionalization of status offenders,separation of juvenile offenders from adults, removal of juveniles fromjails and lock-ups.One of the major activities of this research program is to identify tribesthat perform law enforcement functions or other justice functions for juvenileswho are accused of committing crimes on or near Indian reservations ornative villages. The Secretary of the Interior has designated approximately400 tribes as performing various law enforcement functions. Based on areview of information provided by the Department of the Interior, (<T4>Federal Register</T4>, Vol. 53 No. 170 Thursday, September 1, 1988)we believe that a subset of these tribes will be appropriate for inclusionin this study sample. For this study it will be necessary to determine:Which of these tribes perform law enforcement or other justice system functionsfor juveniles; and under what circumstances juveniles are handled by atribal justice system.Non-residential and residential facilities and programs that provide servicesto juveniles accused or adjudicated for delinquent or status offenses bytribal justice systems must be identified and their funding sources andlevel determined. It will also be necessary to determine whether placementof juveniles in these facilities and programs is consistent with the Deinstitutionalization,separation and jail removal requirements of the JJDP Act.In conducting the assessment of programs and facilities for juveniles handledunder tribal systems of justice, attention should also be focused on identifyingpromising approaches for intervening with Indian and Alaskan Native juvenileoffenders. The literature on Indian tribal justice policies and practicessuggests that certain reservations are implementing innovative practicesto prevent delinquency and intervene more effectively with juvenile offenders.Recommendations for dissemination of such program strategies should bedeveloped.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Research Goals and Objectives</ITAG>A. Research GoalsThis research program, ``American Indian and Alaskan Native Youth: Studyof Tribal and Alaskan Native Justice Systems,'' has the following fiveresearch goals:1. To determine how American Indian and Alaskan Native youth are handledunder Indian and Alaskan Native justice systems;2. To determine the resources available to Indian and Alaskan Native justicesystems for providing services to juveniles accused of or adjudicated forstatus and delinquency offenses, including community-based alternativesto incarceration;3. To determine the extent to which Indian tribes and Alaskan Native organizationshave policies, procedures and practices that are consistent with the JJDPAct mandates for deinstitutionalization of status offenders, separationfrom adults, and jail removal;4. To identify promising approaches for intervening with Indian and AlaskanNative juvenile offenders including community-based alternatives to incarceration;and5. To prepare, in consultation with Indians and Alaskan Natives, recommendationsfor improvements in juvenile justice practices under the system of justiceadministered by Indian tribes and Alaskan Native organizations.B. ObjectivesIn order to achieve the above stated goals, the following three objectivesmust be met:1. Development of a research design and strategy to identify and assess(among Indian and Alaskan Native organizations) Native justice system policies,procedures and practices for handling juveniles; the resources availableto the justice system for juvenile services and programs; consistency oflaws, policies and procedures with Federal mandates on confinement of juveniles;and promising interventions.2. Implementation of the research design and collection of data on Indianand Alaskan Native juvenile justice policies, practices, available resources,consistency with Federal mandates, and promising interventions; and3. Analysis of collected data, delineation of findings, preparation ofreports on the current status of Indian and Alaskan Native juvenile justice,and recommendations for improvements in policies, procedures, practices,and dissemination of promising interventions.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Research Design and Program Strategy</ITAG>OJJDP's planning and program development activities are guided by a frameworkthat specifies four sequential phases of program development: Research,Development, Demonstration, and Dissemination. This framework guides thedecision-making process regarding the funding of future stages of the program.This program is a research initiative. The purpose of a research initiativeis to identify and enhance the information available on issues that relateto the administration of juvenile justice and to the prevention of delinquencyin the United States. The program will be conducted in three discrete incrementalstages:(I) The research design stage, which involves the development of a researchmethodology for the assessment of justice system handling of youth by Indiantribes and Alaskan Native organizations;(II) the implementation stage, in which data will be collected, processedand prepared for analysis using the methodology developed in the previousstage; and(III) the data analysis and reporting stage, which involves the analysisof the data and the preparation of reports that summarize the results ofthe study and provide recommendations for improving juvenile justice policiesand practices of Indian tribes and Alaskan Native organizations. All technicaland subject matter portions of the program will be guided by recommendationsof an advisory committee established specifically for the program. Theadvisory committee will provide comments and recommendations regardingthe strategies and activities for this program. It may be necessary tochange or supplement advisory committee members for different stages ofthe program. However, the objective will be to select technical and subjectmatter experts capable of addressing issues related to each of the programstages.The advisory committee members are to have combined expertise in the followingareas: Indian and Alaskan Native justice system and youth services; researchon criminal, juvenile justice and delinquency prevention issues among Indiansand Alaskan Natives; and experience with large-scale, multi-site research.Each stage of the program development process detailed below is designedto result in a complete and publishable product (eg: research design),and a dissemination strategy to inform the field of the development ofthe program and the results and products of each stage. A decision to continueor to terminate the program is made at the end of each stage based on theavailability of funds and the quality and utility of program products.A. Stage I_Research DesignThe first stage of the program consists of developing the research design.To accomplish this task, the research team will convene a working groupof individuals with the combined necessary expertise to conduct the followingtasks: articulate the critical research issues; identify key research questions;conduct a literature review; define key terms, such as juvenile offenders,justice system agencies and services, and community-based alternativesto incarceration; construct data collection instruments; specify plansfor protection of the confidentiality of data; develop strategies to maximizeaccess to data sources; specify a sampling strategy that accounts for thediversity in policy, practice and resources among tribes and reservations;and develop data analysis plans. The final product of this stage will bethe research design that will be used to guide the implementation of theresearch.To inform the development of this research design, the research team mustconduct a comprehensive review of: (1) Statistical reports and data bases on the extent to which Indian andAlaskan Native youth living on or near a reservation engage in delinquentbehavior and are involved in tribal, Federal, State, and local justicesystems; (2) literature on the structure, organization and jurisdiction of tribaljustice systems' handling of Indian and Alaskan Native youth; and(3) literature on Indian tribal and Alaska Native juvenile justice policies,practices and procedures.<ITAG tagnum="81">1.

Stage II_Data Collection and Data Processing This stage involves full implementation of the data collection plan usingthe methodology and instruments developed in the previous stage. The datacollection instruments should be pilot tested and the project advisorycommittee should review the results of the pilot tests. It is expectedthat a preliminary report on the results of the pilot tests, includingcomments from the advisory committee, will be prepared and appropriaterevisions to the instruments and the overall research design will be made.This stage also includes the preparation of the data for analysis. Dataprocessing involves the preparation and application of appropriate datacoding strategies and entry of the data into an automated data processingsystem.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Stage II Activities</ITAG>Applicants must describe how the following activities will be undertaken:a. Preparation of a comprehensive data collection plan; b. Pilot tests of the data collection instruments;c. Advisory committee review of the results of the pilot tests and appropriateadjustments to methodology and/or instruments; d. Data collection; e. Data processing; and f. Preparation of a data file for analysis.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. State II Products </ITAG>The major products to be completed during this stage are:a. Comprehensive data collection plan, including a detailed data collectionprotocol; b. Report on results from pilot tests of data collection instruments andfinal instruments; c. Data tape prepared for analysis, to include all necessary documentation;andd. Dissemination strategy to inform the field of the status of the program.C. Stage III_Data Analysis and ReportingThe final stage of this initiative will involve the analysis of the datacollected and the preparation of reports. The description of the studyand summary of the results to be used by OJJDP in preparing a report toCongress must be submitted to OJJDP no later than September 30, 1991. Applicantsshould outline a set of reports that will communicate the results to avariety of audiences including policy makers, practitioners, and researchersin the juvenile justice system. These reports should describe the study,summarize the results, and provide recommendations for improvements injustice system handling of youth by Indian tribes and Alaskan Native organizations.A critical component of Stage III is the development of recommendationsfor policies, practices, and resource allocation and utilization. Developmentof useful recommendations will require the researcher to demonstrate anawareness of the diversity of the Indian tribes and Alaskan Native practicesand resources, and a sensitivity to the current movement for increasedlevels of self-determination among Native Americans.The research team should work in consultation with tribal and Alaskan Nativerepresentatives to identify and prioritize recommended changes in currentprograms and practices. Recommendations for changes should include an explanationof what the recommended change would involve in terms of any associatedneed for: reallocation of resources, including financial, personnel, facilities,and services; modification of existing tribal, Federal, State and localpolicies and procedures; amendment of current tribal, Federal, State, andlocal laws; and provision of program development, evaluation, trainingand technical assistance services.Considerable attention should be placed on identifying promising delinquencyprevention, intervention, and community-based alternative program approacheswhich have been designed and operationalized by Indian tribal and AlaskanNative organizations. The suitability of such approaches for program replicationat additional sites or for incorporation into a comprehensive service deliverynetwork should be assessed, in close consultation with the leadership ofthe Indian nations.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Stage III Activities</ITAG>Applicants must describe how the following major activities will be undertaken:a. Preparation of a plan for report development and dissemination; b. Analysis of data; c.
