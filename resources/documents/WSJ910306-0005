Abir al-Saqqa, a Palestinian dentist, has dressed hersix-year-old daughter in the colors of the Kuwaiti flag, andher elderly mother in a Free Kuwait shawl. But her face, likeothers in the crowd, is anxious rather than exultant: She hascome to plead for her old job in Kuwait.</LP><TEXT>   Inside the embassy, officials eye the throng withcynicism. &quot;What does this mean?&quot; scoffs one. &quot;Congratulationsfrom a few-score people, desperate for their jobs, when thereare thousands in the streets still screaming support forSaddam.&quot; At the Saudi Arabian Embassy, a few blocks away, adiplomat is even more blunt. &quot;They will never go back,&quot; hesays of the Palestinians. &quot;Not to Kuwait, not to Saudi, not achance.&quot;   The Gulf war has scattered its victims far from itsbattlefields. But as Iraqi prisoners rumble home on Red Crosstrucks and as exiled Kuwaitis await flights to their country,thousands of dazed Palestinians are once again findingthemselves with nowhere to go. Their champion was SaddamHussein, and their loss is almost as great as his.   &quot;This is always the case for Palestinians,&quot; shrugs MahmoudAzzeh, an engineer who lived in Kuwait from 1962 untilfleeing last August. He is living now with his Palestinianrelatives in Jordan, dependent on handouts from a brotherworking in Qatar. Mr. Azzeh had to flee once before, from thePalestinian village of Beit Jibreen during Israel'sindependence war in 1948. But he nonetheless considershimself lucky, for he has missed the many other chapters ofthe Palestinian diaspora: the flight from the West Bank toJordan during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war; the escape fromJordan in September 1970, when King Hussein used tanks tostop Palestinians from taking over his nation; the evacuationfrom Lebanon in 1982, when Israel drove the PalestineLiberation Organization from Beirut.   When the United Nations voted in 1948 to split Palestinein two to create a homeland for the Jews, it solved theproblem of one displaced people and created the problem ofanother. While most Palestinians now would gladly seize thepiece of Palestine they were offered in 1948, at that timethey rejected it, waged war against the Jews to regain all ofPalestine, and lost.   Some U.S. officials say George Bush, having liberatedKuwait, would like nothing more than to also negotiate aland-for-peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. Butothers doubt he is ready to undertake the head-bangingnecessary to bring this about.   &quot;There's lots of loose talk about addressing Middle Eastissues without addressing the classic conundrum of how todeliver Israelis to a settlement they don't think they need,&quot;says one veteran envoy in Amman. The Palestinians, he says,&quot;stand a strong chance of becoming another one of the MiddleEast's lost causes, along with the Armenians, the Kurds, theDruse and the Maronites.&quot;   Until now, the Palestinians have proved adept at keepingtheir cause alive in the face of punishing defeats. But whilethey have often won attention, they haven't always earnedsympathy. For more than a decade after the 1967 war, the wordPalestinian became synonymous with terrorist. Palestinianshijacked aircraft, massacred Israeli athletes and gunned downmoderate Arabs. Using terror, says Don Kerr of theInternational Institute of Strategic Studies, was thePalestinians' biggest mistake. &quot;Sure, it gets you noticed,but if you look at the faces looking at you, none of them aresmiling.&quot;   The image hasn't been helped by the PLO chairman, YasserArafat, invariably clad in green fatigues and packing apistol. Yet most of the world's five million Palestinianshave never held a gun or thrown a stone. They might be foundteaching literature at Columbia University, or running agiant construction firm in Athens, or advising the emir inKuwait on his investments. It was a Palestinian, Khalid abuSaud, who is credited with the strategy of diversifyingKuwait's oil income into the huge corporate shareholdingsthat now are keeping the emirate afloat.   About 2.1 million Palestinians are &quot;dakkil&quot; or insiders,living in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. Some 700,000 ofthem have Israeli citizenship and a vote in the nation'selections. For more than three years, the Palestinians ofGaza and the West Bank have conducted an &quot;intifada,&quot; oruprising, aimed at ending Israeli occupation. The upheavalhas cost hundreds of Palestinian lives, but little has beengained politically.   The &quot;bil kharej,&quot; or outsiders, are a diverse group,scattered throughout Europe, the U.S., the East bloc and theArab world, united only by their wish to return to Palestine.One wealthy businessman now lives in a two-floor apartment inLondon's Mayfair. He has adorned the walls of his indoorswimming pool with murals of Jerusalem. &quot;When I do my laps, Ican swim towards the Dome of the Rock,&quot; he explains. AzizaDeeb, 65 years old, keeps a tattered poster of the samegolden-domed skyline on the bare concrete wall of her hovelin Jordan's Bakka refugee camp. The Jews waited 2,000 yearsto return to their land, she says. &quot;So far, we have onlywaited 43.&quot;   Mrs. Deeb was 17 years old when she fled the Israeli cityof Jaffa. Her family's lands, she says, are now covered bysuburban sprawl. In 1988, the PLO adopted a policy that meansMrs. Deeb will never return to those lands. The organizationsaid, by implication, that it would forfeit its claim to allof Palestine if Israel withdrew from the West Bank and Gaza.   Bassam Abu Sharif, the first PLO official to firmlyarticulate that policy, shows just how far the organizationhas come. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he was spokesmanfor the PLO faction responsible for the airline hijackingsthat climaxed when three planes were blown up in Jordan'sdesert. In those days, he dreamed of recapturing all ofPalestine by the barrel of a gun. He began to change his mindas he lay in a Beirut hospital, recovering from an Israelibomb that arrived hidden inside a book about Che Guevara. Theblast cost him several fingers, part of his face, and much ofhis sight and hearing. &quot;I thought, I can kill an Israeli inretaliation, but I can't kill all of them. They can kill me,but they can't kill all of us.&quot;   This grim calculus gradually led him away from his radicalfaction. In 1988, he penned a moving article calling forpeace for the sake &quot;of our children and the children of theIsraelis.&quot; He was by then an adviser to Mr. Arafat, and hisarticle at first was wildly controversial inside the PLO. Buthis formulation -- the renunciation of terror and recognitionof Israel in return for a homeland in the occupiedterritories -- eventually became PLO policy.   He tells the story at a beach-front restaurant in Tunis,surrounded by others from his scarred generation. One is thewidow of Ali Hassan Salmeh, who helped plan the massacre ofIsraeli athletes at the Munich Olympics and was blown up by acar bomb in Beirut in retaliation. Another is the orphan ofan airline hijacker killed by Israeli commandos at Lodairport.   It is out of this painful dialogue of violence and revengethat Palestinians have created their modern identity. It isan identity crafted mostly in reaction to Jewish nationalism.When Jews began trickling back to their biblical homelandaround the beginning of this century, the Arabs who livedthere were under Ottoman rule. Those who defined themselvesas members of a group bigger than a village or clan mostlysaw themselves as part of Greater Syria. That sprawling Arabheartland was split up after World War I by the French andBritish. Britain took a mandate over Palestine, which thenincluded Jordan.   The early Zionists, arriving mostly from Russia, seemedbarely conscious of the Arab world around them. Theirwritings are full of visions for the land and myopia aboutits people. When Golda Meir stated that Palestine was a landwithout a people for a people without a land, she wasarticulating what many Zionists had allowed themselves tobelieve. Awareness of Arabs only began to intrude on theearly Zionists when the Arabs took up arms against them. Butby then, the Holocaust was under way in Germany, and millionsof Jews were looking for a place to go.   If you are drowning and you see a life raft with only afew people in it, writes the Israeli author Amos Elon, youdon't question the morality of climbing aboard. Most of theworld also saw it that way, voting overwhelmingly to create atiny Jewish state in part of Palestine. By then, Jordan hadalready been created as an Arab kingdom; the remainder of theBritish mandate -- the Palestinian-Arab state -- would haveincluded much of modern Israel.   But the Palestinians and their Arab neighbors abhorred theceding of any land, and continued to refuse to recognizeIsrael even after the 1948 war. In 1967, Egypt threatened towipe out the Jewish state, and Israel launched a pre-emptivestrike, virtually destroying Egypt's air force on the ground.Israel asked Jordan to stay out of the war, but King Husseinattacked, and lost the West Bank. After another war in 1973,Egypt broke ranks with the other Arabs and made a separatepeace in a deal that was to have included some politicalautonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza as afirst step to a final settlement. However, the lands wouldstill have remained part of Israel.   The PLO rejected the plan, insisting it offeredPalestinians little true power. So Israel continued itsoccupation of Gaza and the West Bank and kept on buildingJewish settlements in among the Palestinians.   Since 1988, the PLO seemed to be making some headway withits proposal to trade recognition of Israel's right to existfor a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank. Publicopinion polls showed that between 40% and 50% of Israeliswere willing to discuss the proposal with the PLO. But thencame the Gulf war and the enduring image of Mr. Arafatembracing Saddam Hussein. As the Scuds flew, and Palestinianscheered, the willingness of Israelis to discuss peace withthe PLO evaporated. Meanwhile, those PLO figures talkingpeace have been increasingly drowned out by more radicalPalestinians such as Abul Abbas, who continues to call forterrorist strikes against Israel.   At PLO headquarters in Tunis, some speak of the need for apurge of the organization's hierarchy, dumping Abul Abbas andkicking Mr. Arafat upstairs into an elder-statesman role topreserve him as an icon but open the way for a moreeffective, less-tainted leader. But mechanisms for such ahousecleaning are uncertain. A leadership shake-up couldbackfire, opening the way for Islamic radicals who don't wantany compromise with Israel.   King Hussein, now popular with the Palestinians, couldplay a role, but only if the Palestinians themselves offerhim a clear mandate. The king is aware that negotiations willrequire compromises, perhaps including adjustments interritory. If the Palestinians' own leaders make suchconcessions, that is one thing. But for the king to be theone to make them would brand him as an Arab traitor forever.   In the mid-1980s, King Hussein struggled to lead aJordanian-Palestinian delegation to the negotiating table,only to be stymied by a combination of Mr. Arafat'svacillation, Saudi meddling and U.S. inattention. Now, hesays, &quot;Palestinians are the people who have to make thedecision whether they talk with us or what.&quot;   Doing nothing holds great risks. In a handsome Jordaniandrawing room, a lifelong Palestinian moderate points to histwo sons, products of the status quo. In the 1989 elections,one campaigned for a former terrorist who rejects Israel'sright to exist. The other has embraced Islamic fundamentalismand wants to free Palestine through &quot;jihad.&quot;   In the refugee camps, this potent brew of demographics andextremism is on even starker display. The streets are mobbedby children; more than 60% of the Palestinian population isunder 20 years old. In her cold concrete shack, Mrs. Deebjabs a Western visitor with a boney finger. &quot;Our children arebreast-fed on the word `Palestine,&quot; yells the mother of eightand grandmother of 26. &quot;Go ahead, kill Saddam. We can sendyou 100 more Saddams.&quot;   Outside, dusty cars with registration plates from Kuwaitand Saudi Arabia signal a spring without hope. ThePalestinian owners used to send money back to families here;now they have returned jobless. Some 150,000 people have comeback to Jordan so far; the number could swell to 450,000 ifGulf states make good on threats not to renew workers'contracts.   Zayed Salah, a Palestinian, reflects on his people'splight from the huge villa he built on a hill outside Amman.Mr. Salah made his fortune in Saudi Arabia and now runs alarge construction firm in Jordan. &quot;We are the petrodollargeneration,&quot; he says, but the next generation won't havethose opportunities. A few weeks ago, he advertised for twoengineers. Some 500 people applied. &quot;They will accept anysalary you give them; even a janitor's salary,&quot; he says.   For the jobless, the Middle East will be &quot;like a pressurecooker,&quot; says Jihad Wazier, a 27-year-old Palestinianstudying in the U.S. In 1988, his father, Abu Jihad, the No.2 man in the PLO, was killed by an Israeli hit squad inTunis. To be Palestinian, says Mr. Wazir, is to labor likeSisyphus, rolling a stone up a hill. &quot;My father didn't getthe stone to the top, but I am here to take over from him,and the next generation will be here to take over from me,&quot;he says.   ---                   A Diaspora's Fallout                                                                                                          Population of Palestinians, and percent of country'spopulation, based on 1985 data                                                                                                                                        NUMBER OF   % OF COUNTRY'S                               PALESTINIANS    POPULATION                                                                                                          Gaza                           500,000         ...
