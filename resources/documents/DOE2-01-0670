Diffusion measurements made parallelto the magnetic field are adequately explained by the theory. For valuesof {omega}/sub c/tau andgt; 3.5, the diffusion across the magnetic field ismore rapid than that predicted by theory that takes into account theanisotropic magnetoconductive properties of germanium. If we expressthe observed diffusion coefficient as the sum of the computed collisionalcoefficient plus a term D/sub excess/, representing the additional diffusion,we find at the largest achievable values of {omega}/sub c/tau D/sub excess/is within a factor of two of the Bohm value, kT/16eB cm{sup 2}/sec. 34refs., 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
