Gov. Henry Bellmon announced yesterday that he signed an order removing Robert Y. Empie, the state's veteran bank commissioner and formerly one of the state's leading bankers, after attorneys for the governor and Robert Henry, the attorney general, investigated bank stock holdings held by Mr. Empie and his family.    They contend that Mr. Empie held or controlled -- and continues to hold or control -- more than 50,000 shares of stock in United Oklahoma Bankshares Inc., a troubled Oklahoma City bank holding company Mr. Empie once headed.    Mr. Empie says he no longer owns the stock, nor shares in any other bank, but yesterday he said that the stock only had a value of about 12 cents a share, based on quotes he had seen recently in local newspapers. An independent valuation of the stock wasn't available late yesterday, because the shares haven't traded actively as the banking concern's troubles mounted.    In an order of removal signed Monday by Gov. Bellmon, a Republican who took office in January, the governor said stock sales or &quot;attempts to sell stock&quot; occurred on three separate days, as recently as Feb. 9. Gov. Bellmon also said that Mr. Empie &quot;intentionally misled&quot; the governor and the attorney general during a meeting last January &quot;as to the nature and extent of previous stock transactions involving the shares.&quot;    Sam Armstrong, the governor's press secretary, declined to say whether Mr. Empie profited from any alleged stock sales. Nor would he elaborate on what triggered a probe of Mr. Empie's stock dealings. All Mr. Armstrong said was that &quot;Gov. Bellmon received some information.&quot;    Mr. Empie, who was in Los Angeles yesterday, denied in an interview that he owned &quot;any stock in banks or any bank holding company.&quot; He added, &quot;What I had I put in a blind trust,&quot; in 1979, when he was first named bank commissioner, and that &quot;I totally severed my relations with the banking industry.&quot; Mr. Empie's son Roger is named beneficiary of the trust.    Mr. Empie conceded, however, that his wife, Kathryn, is trustee of the blind trust, but he said she didn't solicit any investment-management advice from him.    But Gov. Bellmon, in his order, said Mr. Empie &quot;misled the state . . . into believing that he had removed himself from any potential conflict of interest&quot; by establishing a blind trust. &quot;In fact,&quot; the order said, &quot;Mr. Empie continued to be informed of the assets in the trust and the value of those assets and remained in control of their disposition.&quot;    Mr. Empie said he believes the governor's action is tinged with politics. &quot;There is some hidden agenda on this,&quot; he claimed. He said it was designed to remove him and please some bankers whom he has angered over the past year, in which Oklahoma has been rocked with a banking crisis. Mr. Empie said he sought to meet with the newly elected governor, &quot;but he is in a very determined hurry to accomplish my removal.&quot;    Before being appointed the state's top bank regulator, Mr. Empie served as president of United Oklahoma for 16 years, following in the footsteps of his father, who was also president of the bank. The Empie family's connection to United Oklahoma stretches back three generations, and family members at one point held 15% of the bank's stock.    During his tenure at United Oklahoma, the younger Mr. Empie, a blunt-spoken banker, served as president of the Oklahoma Bankers Association, the state's leading trade group.    Under Oklahoma law, Mr. Empie, who is 67 years old, has 20 days to request a hearing before an officer appointed by the governor. He said he plans to return to Oklahoma late today and file such a request. In the meantime, the governor appointed as acting commissioner Wayne Osborne, the deputy bank commissioner.    The governor's order also accused Mr. Empie of using information &quot;available to him only by reason of his position . . . to determine when to sell or attempt to sell shares of stock in a bank&quot; that he regulated.    The order said: &quot;All or some of these sales, or attempts to sell, occurred after Mr. Empie received information from state bank examiners and other employees of the state banking department concerning the deteriorating status of the bank or banking assets of the holding company whose shares were held by Mr. Empie or other entities&quot; of the Empie family.    Mr. Empie said, &quot;I have no idea when United Oklahoma Bank was examined.&quot;    An official of United Oklahoma didn't return phone calls. </TEXT></DOC>
