(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An 11-year-old boy said he's learnedit pays to fight for what he believes in, after school officialsrescinded his suspension and allowed him to return to class withoutcutting off his Mohawk haircut.   Matt Youngs, who was suspended for refusing to cut a haircutauthorities deemed disruptive, will be allowed back in schoolMonday, officials said Friday.   Superintendent Alson Dougherty said a potential court battleover Youngs' hair wasn't worth the trouble. The boy can wear hishair as he pleases, the superintendent said.   ``I want it back to normal,'' the boy said of his hectic week.``I want to wear my hair the way it is and not be hassled.''   Youngs was suspended for five days because school officials saidhis haircut was an embarrassment to the school, Dougherty said.Matt's hair was long in the back, shaved on the sides and given abrush cut on top.   ``Never has so little hair caused so much consternation among somany folks,'' Dougherty said.   The boy's parents, William and Clifta Youngs, said they didn'tnecessarily like their son's haircut, but they liked even less theschool system telling Matt he had to change it.   The Youngs said they were willing to go to court to defendMatt's right to wear his hair the way he liked.   ``It's grown all out of proportion to the reality of thesituation,'' Dougherty said after announcing that Matt would bewelcomed back at Sackets Harbor Central School.   A court fight could drag on for years, building up enormouslawyers' fees, he said, adding that he couldn't justify makingtaxpayers foot the bill.   ``He may be a graduate'' by the time a court fight is resolved,Dougherty said.   Matt and three of his friends first cut their hair in the Mohawkfashion about three months ago. On March 16, Principal RobertWagoner Jr. wrote to the boys' parents, saying the boys would besuspended if they did not change their hair. All but Matt's parentscomplied.   Since his suspension, Matt said he has received a couple ofdozen letters, mostly from people urging him not to give in. Healso received several calls from radio stations wanting tointerview him.   ``It's hard waking up at 8 in the morning to talk to DJ's,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
