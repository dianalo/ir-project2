As the Dow Jones Industrial Average leaped 2.1% and eclipsed its two-year-old record, the Nasdaq Composite reached a new high for the sixth time this year, closing at 465.88, up 4.20, or 0.9%. The OTC market first hit a new peak Aug. 3.    The aggressive buying of OTC issues spawned spirited trading. Volume totaled 144.8 million shares. Overall, 1,228 issues advanced and 762 declined.    The Nasdaq 100 Index jumped 5.81 to 440.79 and the Nasdaq Financial Index added 2.31 to 461.68.    Ed Mazzella, executive vice president of OTC trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, characterized the buying as &quot;pure.&quot; He said: &quot;It wasn't just people running with the programs. We saw very large institutional buyers for the first time this week.&quot; Mr. Mazzella said some individual investors, who have been notably absent from the market for months, also returned yesterday.    Traders said buyers continued to be most interested in the OTC market's biggest issues. The market's biggest stock in terms of market capitalization, MCI Communications, gained 2 to 39 1/2 on 2.5 million shares.    There were rumors throughout the day that MCI was contemplating paying an initial dividend. But a spokeswoman said, &quot;the payment of a dividend isn't under active consideration.&quot;    Some technology stocks that had helped fuel the market's rise earlier in the week faltered yesterday. Software stocks, in particular, were weaker. Microsoft, which had added more than 3 points in the past two sessions, lost 1/4 to 59. Ashton-Tate dropped 7/8 to 12, and Lotus Development fell 1/4 to 26 1/2.    Among financial stocks, insurance issues continued their lackluster performance, adding only 0.79 to 533.62. Among the insurance stocks losing ground, Hartford Steam Boiler dropped 1/4 to 52 1/4.    But other financial stocks moved more in line with the overall market. The Nasdaq Bank Index rose a strong 5.10 to 489.95, while the Nasdaq Other Finance Index gained 2.74 to 552.08.    The Other Finance Index, which includes the market's thrift issues, is just 1.34 point below its all-time high, set in July 1986. Since then, stocks in the index have taken a beating, reflecting the problems in the savings and loan industry. But the recent effort to bail out the industry is making the stocks popular again.    A. Cuyler Kline, head of OTC trading at Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta, said thrift stocks have &quot;led the parade&quot; at his firm this year. He said profit-taking following the passage of the savings and loan bailout bill two weeks ago has brought share prices of many issues in the group back to cheaper levels.    &quot;A bottoming out has taken place, and now they've begun a new advance,&quot; Mr. Kline said.    Valley National Bancorp gained 1/2 point to 28. The company agreed to acquire Meadowlands National Bank of North Bergen, N.J., for about 150,000 of its shares plus $500,000 in cash and other considerations for a total of about $4.5 million.    In other news, Class A shares of TeleCommunications added 5/8 to 38 1/8. The company said one of its units will try to raise $200 million in the Japanese capital markets.    The American depositary receipts of a foreign telecommunications concern, L.M. Ericsson Telephone, got a boost following a string of company announcements that painted a rosy outlook for the company.    Ericsson's ADRs rose 13 5/8 to 117 1/4 after the company said its pretax earnings in the latest six months rose 164% from last year. The company also said it expects to report higher pretax earnings, before appropriations, for the year.    Wheelabrator Group rose 1/8 to 9 7/8 on volume of about two million shares. The merger of Wheelabrator Group and its majority-held Wheelabrator Technologies unit is expected to be completed today. Wheelabrator Technologies added 1 to 34 1/4.    PHP Healthcare surged 1 1/8 to 6 3/8. The company agreed in principle to settle certain lawsuits against it that have been pending since July 1987.    Class B shares of Adolph Coors slid 2 5/8 to 20. PaineWebber downgraded its rating on the stock to &quot;unattractive&quot; from &quot;attractive,&quot; according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. The brokerage firm had recently boosted the rating on the stock because of Coors's possible acquisition of some assets from Stroh Brewery.    Qintex Entertainment dropped 1 1/8 to 8 on 390,000 shares, as the company's proposed merger with MGM/UA Communications took another step forward. Qintex said that to facilitate the merger, it amended the acquisition structure to provide for the initial acquisition of MGM/UA by a Qintex unit, Qintex Media B.V.    Medical Care International jumped 2 5/8 to 22 1/4. The company agreed in principle to acquire Boston-based MediVision Inc., a closely held company, for a combination of cash and common stock valued at about $45 million.    Micron Technology slipped 3/4 to 14. The Professional Investor Report said Montgomery Securities in San Francisco lowered its revenue and earnings estimates for the company because of a change in the company's product mix. </TEXT></DOC>
