But robot makers, who have cut costs to reduce financial losses, are hoping for a 1988 rebound.    The robot business has failed to meet rosy industry projections since 1985, when auto makers slashed automation plans and buyers canceled $94 million in orders. But Donald A. Vincent, executive vice president of the Robotics Industries Association, an Ann Arbor, Mich., trade group, says the industry &quot;bottomed out in 1987.&quot;    Manufacturers outside the auto industry are buying more robots and the dollar's fall helps as well, says John O'Hara, vice chairman of ASEA Brown Boveri Inc., a U.S. arm of the Swedish company that says it's the world's No. 1 robot maker. In the past, auto makers have accounted for 60% to 70% of U.S. robot sales. &quot;Volumes have come down in automotive, but in non-automotive you see it gradually building,&quot; he says, as electronics-parts companies and farm and heavy equipment makers buy more.    While U.S. makers' results have been disappointing, importers have fared better. Imports of robots and parts totaled $191.9 million last year, rising for the third straight year, the Commerce Department says. One reason -- Japanese auto makers setting up plants here tend to order robots from the suppliers they used in their plants in Japan.    Software That Helps   Get to the Point   LESS IS MORE, according to developers of some software programs that force people to write concisely.    A prime benefit of Career Navigator, a program for job hunters, is that it requires users to condense their resumes to one page, says Helene Lauer, director of career services at Babson College, Wellesley, Mass. &quot;The more education people have, the more they write,&quot; she says. &quot;I try to emphasize to people they aren't writing their autobiography,&quot; and using the program enforces it, she adds.    The $129 program, designed by outplacement specialist Drake Beam Morin Inc., New York, allows users to have five separate resumes keyed to different jobs, as well as 10 different cover letters. It also includes self-assessment exercises and job-hunting organizers. Drake Beam says the program, which is recommended by the College Placement Council, an association for career planning, is also useful for job hunters who are long out of college.    The Wordbench word-processing program by Bank Street College of Education, New York, has an added feature that combats writer's block with several techniques, including &quot;nut shelling&quot; -- forcing brevity by limiting the writing space. Other options include free-writing, which prohibits users from going back to edit; invisible writing, which keeps the writer from seeing the words as they're written; and goal setting, which asks the writer to describe the subject, audience, point of view and purpose of writing.    Customized Chip Design   Is Becoming Easier   THERE ARE now some 10,000 engineering teams designing integrated circuits, up from just 1,000 at the beginning of the decade, according to Technology Research Group, a Boston firm. The increase reflects growing use of application specific integrated circuits, called ASICs, that let engineers customize chips without designing from the ground up.    ASICs are likely to become even more popular with the adoption of a new technology called automatic logic synthesis. New logic synthesis software lets engineers specify what functions the chip will perform. The software then chooses the specific electronic parts that will be used and creates the most efficient design.    &quot;It represents a fundamental change in the process engineers go through,&quot; says Andrew Rappaport, president of Technology Research. Isadore Katz, an analyst with Dataquest Inc., says the method may be as important in speeding up electronics design as the computer-aided engineering techniques introduced by Daisy Systems and Mentor Graphics in the early 1980s.    Some independent companies are starting to sell software that will let customers pick and choose among different technologies: Among them are Silc Technologies Inc., Burlington, Mass.; and Synopsys Inc., Mountain View, Calif.    The software speeds up design by four to 10 times over conventional means. Today, most designers of ASICs write three or four pages describing the needed electronic behavior of each part of the chip and then write out the structure of several thousand parts. Using the new software, they just describe the behavior. The software does the rest.    Unlocking Software   For Computer Users -   AN ADD-ON for personal computers claims it can help beginners quickly master such software programs as Lotus 1-2-3 and Multimate Advantage.    The Simplifier is a 9-inch by 11-inch console with 35 keys that users plug into the personal computer's keyboard. It has special cartridges that use artificial intelligence to interpret the complex commands required by some software programs.    Eric Bromley, product developer and president of Penguin Group Inc., Bloomfield, Conn., says with the Simplifier, which costs $600, &quot;there is virtually no need to consult the elaborate software program manuals in learning how to use . . . software.&quot;    Mr. Bromley hopes for longer term success than he achieved with his previous computer design, Coleco Industries Inc.'s highly touted but breakdown-prone Adam home computer. </TEXT></DOC>
