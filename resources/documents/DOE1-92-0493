This results in a profusion of trans-frontier pollution-controlallocation problems which can be solved in a satisfactory way only byan international cooperation between governmental bodies and organizationsowing to the nations' rights of sovereignty. The author studies the associatedproblem of negotiations and makes use of game theory approaches for two-countrymodels to analyse alternative initial and marginal conditions existingboth on the institutional level and within the environmental system concernedfor their effects on possible negotiation results while focussing onissues of allocation and distribution theory.
